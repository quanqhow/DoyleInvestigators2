of my niece margery fleming in harry room i think it likely there be some truth in the gossip jane hear about the two and if there be go to be a wed why the pearl be to go to margery anyhow but i find

trouble i dismiss shortly while it be odd that only ten pearl should have be take still in every other way it bore the mark of an ordinary theft the thief might have think that by leave the majority of the gem he could postpone discovery indefinitely but the fleming case be of a different order take by itself fleming disappearance could have be easily account for there must be time in the live of all unscrupulous individual when they feel the need of retire temporarily from the public eye but the intrusion into the fleming home the ransack desk and the break money drawer most of all the bite

how do you explain it i just dont attempt to explain it it seem the very maddest queerest thing that ever happen to me the queerest perhaps say holmes thoughtfully what do you make of it yourself well i dont profess to understand it yet this case of yours be very complex sir henry when take in conjunction with your uncle death i be not sure that of all the five hundred case of capital importance

wife be a respectable a couple a any in the county at the same time say baskerville it clear enough that so long a there be none of the family at the hall these people have a mighty fine home and nothing to do that be true do barrymore profit at all by sir charles will ask holmes he and his wife have five hundred pound each ha do they know that they would receive this yes sir charles be very fond of talk about the provision of his will that be very interest i hope say dr mortimer that you do not look with suspicious eye upon everyone who receive a legacy from sir charles for i also have a

every possible search and inquiry yesterday we know nothing of the fate either of rachel howells or of richard brunton the county police be at their wits  end and i have come up to you a a last resource   you can imagine watson with what eagerness i listen to this extraordinary sequence of event and endeavour to piece them together and to devise some common thread upon which they might all hang the butler be go the maid be go the maid have love the butler but have afterwards have cause to hate him she be of welsh blood fiery and passionate she have be terribly excite immediately after

answer here if you care to run your eye over them   he hand me the very paper which i have here watson and this be the strange catechism to which each musgrave have to submit when he come to man s

give it   for the sake of the trust   the original have no date but be in the spell of the middle of the seventeenth century  remark musgrave  i be afraid however that it can be of little help to you in solve this mystery   at least  say i  it give u another mystery and one which be even more interest than the first it may be that the solution of the one may prove to be the solution of the other you will excuse me musgrave if i say that your butler appear to me to have be a very clever man and to have have a clearer insight than ten generation of his masters   i hardly follow you  say musgrave  the paper seem to me to be of no practical importance   but to me it seem immensely practical and i fancy that brunton take the same view he have probably see it before that night on which you catch him   it be very possible we take no pain to hide it   he simply wish i should imagine to refresh his memory upon that last occasion he have a i understand some sort of map or chart which he be compare with the manuscript and which he thrust into his pocket when you appeared   that be true but what could he have to do with this old family custom of ours and what do this rigmarole mean   i don t think that we should have much difficulty in determine that  say i  with your permission we will take the first train down to sussex and go a little more deeply into the matter upon the spot

about two hundred yard from the build  i be already firmly convince watson that there be not three separate mystery here but one only and that if i could read the musgrave ritual aright i should hold

conceive a le emotional subject yet i have tell you how on the first night here i hear her sob bitterly and since then i have more than once observe trace of tear upon her face some deep sorrow gnaw ever at her heart sometimes i wonder if she have a guilty memory which haunt her and sometimes i suspect barrymore of be a domestic tyrant i have always felt that there be something singular and questionable in this man character but the adventure of last night bring all my suspicion to a head and yet it may seem a small matter in itself you be aware that i be not a very sound sleeper and since i have be on guard in this house my slumber have be lighter than ever last night about two in the morning i be arouse by a stealthy step pas my room i rise open my door and peep out a long black shadow be trail down the corridor it be throw by a man who walk softly down the passage with a candle hold in his hand he be in shirt and trouser with no cover to his foot i could merely see the outline but his height tell me that it be barrymore he walk very slowly and circumspectly and there be something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance i have tell you that the corridor be break by the balcony which run round the hall but that it be resume upon the farther side i wait until he have pas out of sight and then i follow him when i come round the balcony he have reach the end of the farther corridor and i could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he have enter one of the room now all these room be unfurnished and unoccupied so that his expedition become more mysterious than ever the light shine steadily a if he be stand motionless i creep down the passage a noiselessly a i could and peep round the corner of the door barrymore be crouch at the window with the candle hold against the glass his profile be half turn towards me and his face seem to be rigid with expectation a he star out into the blackness of the moor for some minute he stand watch intently then he give a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light instantly i make my way back to my room and very shortly come the stealthy step pas once more upon their return journey long afterwards when i have fall into a light sleep i hear a key turn somewhere in a lock but i could not tell whence the sound come what it all mean i cannot guess but there be some secret business go on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of i do not trouble you with my theory for you ask me to furnish you only with fact i have have a long talk with sir henry this morning and we have make a plan of campaign found upon my observation of last night i will not speak about it just now but it should make my next report interest read baskerville hall oct  th my dear holmes if i be compel to leave you without much news during the early day of my mission you must acknowledge that i be make up for lose time and that event be now crowd thick and fast upon u in my last report i end upon my top note with barrymore at the window and now i have quite a budget already which will unless i be much mistake considerably surprise you thing have take a turn which i could not have anticipate in some way they have within the last forty eight hour become much clearer and in some way they have become more complicate but i will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself before breakfast on the morning follow my adventure i go down the corridor and examine the room in which barrymore have be on the night before the western window through which he have star so intently have i notice one peculiarity above all other window in the house it command the nearest outlook on to the moor there be an open between two tree which enable one from this point of view to look right down upon it while from all the other window it be only a distant glimpse which can be obtain it follow therefore that barrymore since only this window would serve the purpose must have be look out for something or somebody upon the moor the night be very dark so that i can hardly imagine how he could have hop to see anyone it have strike me that it be possible that some love intrigue be on foot that would have account for his stealthy movement and also for the uneasiness of his wife the man be a striking looking fellow very well equip to steal the heart of a country girl so that this theory seem to have something to support it that open of the door which i have hear after i have return to my room might mean that he have go out to keep some clandestine appointment so i reason with myself in the morning and i tell you the direction of my suspicion however much the result may have show that they be unfounded but whatever the true explanation of barrymore movement might be i felt that the responsibility of keep them to myself until i could explain them be more than i could bear i have an interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast and i tell him all that i have see he be le surprise than i have expect i know that barrymore walk about night and i have a mind to speak to him about it say he two or three time i have hear his step in the passage come and go just about the hour you name perhaps then he pay a visit every night to that particular window i suggest perhaps he do if so we should be able to shadow him and see what it be that he be after i wonder what your friend holmes would do if he be here i believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest say i he would follow barrymore and see what he do then we shall do it together but surely he would hear u the man be rather deaf and in any case we must take our chance of that well sit up in my room tonight and wait until he pas sir henry rub his hand with pleasure and it be evident that he hail the adventure a a relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor the baronet have be in communication with the architect who prepare the plan for sir charles and with a contractor from london so that we may expect great change to begin here soon there have be decorator and furnishers up from plymouth and it be evident that our friend have large idea and mean to spare no pain or expense to restore the grandeur of his family when the house be renovate and refurnish all that he will need will be a wife to make it complete between ourselves there be pretty clear sign that this will not be want if the lady be will for i have seldom see a man more infatuate with a woman than he be with our beautiful neighbour miss stapleton and yet the course of true love do not run quite a smoothly a one would under the circumstance expect today for example it surface be break by a very unexpected ripple which have cause our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance after the conversation which i have quote about barrymore sir henry put on his hat and prepare to go out a a matter of course i do the same what be you come watson he ask look

that the breach be quite heal and that we be to dine at merripit house next friday a a sign of it i dont say now that he isnt a crazy man say sir henry i cant forget the look in his eye when he run at

enough and i be glad that he should understand her value they have always be together and accord to his account he have be a very lonely man with only her a a companion so that the think of lose her

like the bang of a door a i go up stairs but the noise be terrific down below and i couldnt tell when i go in he be just drop forward and he hesitate the revolver hunter query lynx eyed be in his hand

magnificent tree that i have ever see  that be there when your ritual be draw up  say i a we drive past it  it be there at the norman conquest in all probability  he answer  it have a girth of twenty three feet   have you any old elms  i ask  there use to be a very old one over yonder but it be strike by lightning ten year ago and we cut down the stump   you can see where it use to be   oh yes   there be no other elms   no old one but plenty of beeches   i should like to see where it grew   we have drive up in a dog cart and my client lead me away at once without our enter the house to the scar on the lawn where the elm have stand it be nearly midway between the oak and the house my investigation seem to be progress  i suppose it be impossible to find out how high the elm was  i ask  i can give you it at once it be sixty four feet   how do you come to know it  i ask in surprise  when my old tutor use to give me an exercise in trigonometry it always take the shape of measure height when i be a lad i work out every tree and build in the estate   this be an unexpected piece of luck my data be come more quickly than i could have reasonably hop  tell me  i ask  did your butler ever ask you such a question   reginald musgrave look at me in astonishment  now that you call it to my mind  he answer  brunton  did  ask me about the height of the tree some month ago in connection with some little argument with the groom   this be excellent news watson for it show me that i be on the right road i look up at the sun it be low in the heaven and i calculate that in le than an hour it would lie just above the topmost branch of the old oak one condition mention in the ritual would then be fulfil and the shadow of the elm must mean the farther end of the shadow otherwise the trunk would have be choose a the guide i have then to find where the far end of the shadow would fall when the sun be just clear of the oak   that must have be difficult holmes when the elm be no longer there   well at least i know that if brunton could do it i could also besides there be no real difficulty i go with musgrave to his study and whittle myself this peg to which i tie this long string with a knot at each yard then i take two length of a fishing rod which come to just six foot and i go back with my client to where the elm have be the sun be just graze the top of the oak i fasten the rod on end mark out the direction of the shadow and measure it it be nine foot in length  of course the calculation now be a simple one if a rod of six foot throw a shadow of nine a tree of sixty four foot would throw one of ninety six and the line of the one would of course be the line of the other i measure out the distance which bring me almost to the wall of the house and i thrust a peg into the spot you can imagine my exultation watson when within two inch of my peg i saw a conical depression in the grind i know that it be the mark make by brunton in his measurement and that i be still upon his trail  from this starting point i proceed to step have first take the cardinal point by my pocket compass ten step with each foot take me along parallel with the wall of the house and again i mark my spot with a peg then i carefully pace off five to the east and two to the south it bring me to the very threshold of the old door two step to the west mean now that i be to go two pace down the stone flagged passage and this be the place indicate by the ritual  never have i felt such a cold chill of disappointment watson for a moment it seem to me that there must be some radical mistake in my calculation the set sun shine full upon the passage floor and i could see that the old foot worn grey stone with which it be pave be firmly cement together and have certainly not be move for many a long year brunton have not be at work here i tap upon the floor but it sound the same all over and there be no sign of any crack or crevice but fortunately musgrave who have begin to appreciate the mean of my proceed and who be now a excite a myself take out his manuscript to check my calculation  and under  he cry  you have omit the  and under   i have think that it mean that we be to dig but now of course i saw at once that i be wrong  there be a cellar under this then  i cry  yes and a old a the house down here through this door   we go down a wind stone stair and my companion strike a match light a large lantern which stand on a barrel in the corner in an instant it be obvious that we have at last come upon the true place and that we have not be the only people to visit the spot recently  it have be use for the storage of wood but the billet which have evidently be litter over the floor be now pile at the side so a to leave a clear space in the middle in this space lay a large and heavy flagstone with a rust iron ring in the centre to which a thick shepherd s check muffler be attach  by jove  cry my client  that s brunton s muffler i have see it on him and could swear to it what have the villain be do here   at my suggestion a couple of the county police be summon to be present and i then endeavour to raise the stone by pull on the cravat i could only move it slightly and it be with the aid of one of the constable that i succeed at last in carry it to one side a black hole yawn beneath into which we all peer while musgrave kneel at the side push down the
