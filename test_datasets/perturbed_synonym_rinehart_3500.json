[{"label": "doyle", "text": "mr barrymore be of sake to me she be a heavy solid soul very limit intensely respectable and incline to be puritanical you could hardly believe a le emotional subject yet i have tell you how on the first night here i hear her sob bitterly and since then i have more than once observe trace of tear upon her present some deep regret gnaw ever at her heart sometimes i curiosity if she have a guilty memory which haunt her and sometimes i suspect barrymore of be a domestic autocrat i have always felt that there be something singular and questionable in this man's character but the venture of final night bring all my suspicion to a head and yet it may appear a small matter in itself you be aware that i be not a really sound sleeper and since i have be on guard in this house my slumber let follow lighter than ever last night about two in the morning i be arouse by a stealthy step pa my room i rise clear my door and peep out a long black shadow be trail down the corridor it be throw by a man who walk softly down the passage with a candle hold in his hand he be in shirt and trouser with no cover to his foot i could merely see the outline but his summit tell me that it be barrymore he walk very slowly and circumspectly and there be something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole show i have tell you that the corridor be break by the balcony which run round the hall but that it be resume upon the farther side i wait until he have pa out of survey and so i come him when i come round the balcony he have make the end of the farther corridor and i could see from the intimation of light through an open door that he have enter one of the room now all these room be unfurnished and unoccupied so that his expedition become more mysterious than ever the light glitter steadily a if he be stand motionless i creep down the passage a noiselessly a i could and peep round the corner of the door barrymore be crouch at the window with the candle hold against the glass his profile be half turn towards me and his face appear to be rigid with expectation a he star out into the blackness of the moor for some minute he stand watch intently then he give a deep moan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light directly i make my way back to my room and very shortly come the stealthy step pa once more upon their return journey long afterwards when i have fall into a idle sleep i hear a key work somewhere in a lock but i could not tell whence the sound come what it all mean i cannot guess but there follow some secret concern go along in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of i do not trouble you with my theory for you ask me to furnish you only with fact i have have a long talk with sir henry this morning and we have make a plan of campaign find upon my observation of last night i will not speak about it simply now but it should make my next report pastime take baskerville hall oct 15th my dear holmes if i be compel to leave you without much news during the early day of my mission you must acknowledge that i be make up for lose time and that event be now crowd thick and fast upon u in my final report i end upon my top note with barrymore at the window and now i have quite a budget already which will unless i be much mistake considerably surprise you thing have take a turn which i could not have anticipate in some way they have inside the lowest forty eight hour become much clearer and in some way they let go more complicate but i will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself before breakfast on the morning follow my adventure i get down the corridor and see the room in which barrymore have be on the night before the western window through which he make star so intently take i notice one peculiarity above all other window in the family it command the nearest mindset on to the wharf there be an open between two tree which enable one from this point of view to look right down upon it while from all the other window it be only a distant glimpse which can follow obtain it come therefore that barrymore since only this window would serve the use must have follow appear out for something or somebody upon the moor the night be very dark so that i can hardly imagine how he could have hop to see anyone it have strike me that it be possible that some love intrigue be on foot that would have account for his furtive movement and also for the uneasiness of his wife the man be a strike look fellow very well equip to buy the heart of a country girl so that this theory seem to have something to keep it that unfold of the door which i have hear after i have return to my room might mean that he give go out to keep some clandestine appointment indeed i reason with myself in the morning and i tell you the direction of my suspicion however much the result may have show that they be unfounded but whatever the true explanation of barrymore's movement might follow i felt that the responsibility of keep them to myself until i could explain them follow more than i could bear i have an interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast and i tell him all that i have consider he follow le surprise than i have expect i know that barrymore walk about night and i have a mind to speak to him about it say he two or three clock i have hear his step in the passage come and go just around the hour you make perhaps then he give a visit every night to that particular window i suggest perhaps he come if so we should be able to shadow him and see what it be that he be after i wonder what your friend holmes would do if he be here i believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest say i he would follow barrymore and find what he do then we shall do it together but surely he would see u the man follow instead deaf and in any subject we must take our chance of that we'll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he pa sir henry rub his hand with pleasure and it be evident that he hail the adventure a a relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor the baronet have be in communication with the architect who prepare the plan for sir charles and with a contractor from london thus that we may expect great change to begin here soon there have follow decorator and furnishers up from plymouth and it be evident that our friend have large idea and mean to spare no pain or expense to restore the nobility of his family when the house be renovate and refurnish all that he will need will be a wife to make it complete between ourselves there be pretty clear mark that this will not be want if the lady be will for i let seldom ensure a man more infatuate with a woman than he be with our beautiful neighbour miss stapleton and yet the course of true bed do not run quite a smoothly a one would under the circumstance expect today for example it surface follow break by a very unexpected ripple which have cause our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance after the conversation which i have quote about barrymore sir henry put on his hat and prepare to go out a a affair of course i do the same what be you come watson he expect look at me in a curious way that depend on whether you be go on the moor say i yes i be well you know what my instruction be i be sorry to intrude but you hear how earnestly holmes insist that i should not leave you and peculiarly that you should not go entirely upon the moor sir henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile my good fellow say he holmes with all his wisdom do not foresee some thing which have happen since i have be on the moor you see me i be sure that you be the last man in the world who would wish to be a spoil sport i must go out alone it put me in a most awkward position i be at a loss what to say or what to do and before i have make up my mind he pick up his cane and be go but when i come to think the matter over my conscience reproach me bitterly for have on any pretext reserve him to go out of my sight i imagine what my spirit would be if i have to return to you and to confess that some misfortune have occur through my dismiss for your instruction i check you my cheek flush at the very think it might not even now follow too late to overtake him so i do off at once in the direction of merripit house i hurry along the road at the top of my hurry without ensure anything of sir henry until i come to the point where the moor path branch off there fear that perhaps i have come in the wrong direction after all single mount a hill from which i could command a view the same mound which be cut into the sour quarry thence i saw him at once he be on the moor course about a quarter of a mile sour and a lady be by his side who could only be miss stapleton it be clear that there be already an understand between them and that they have meet by appointment they be walk slowly along in deep conversation and i saw her make quick little movement of her deal a if she be very earnest in what she be say while he listen intently and formerly or twice shake his point in strong differ i stand among the sway watch them very much puzzle a to what i should do next to follow them and break into their intimate conversation seem to follow an scandal and yet my clear duty follow never for an instant to let him out of my sight to act the spy upon a champion be a hateful task still i could see no better course than to observe him from the hill and to clear my conscience by confess to him afterwards what i have do it be true that if any sudden danger have threaten him i be too far away to be of function and yet i be sure that you will agree with me that the side follow really difficult and that there be nothing more which i could do our acquaintance sir henry and the lady have halt along the path and follow stand profoundly absorb in their conversation when i be suddenly aware that i be not the solitary witness of their interview a wisp of green float in the air catch my middle and another glance show me that it be carry on a beat by a human who follow move among the break grind it be stapleton with his butterfly sack he be very much close to the span than i be and he appear to be move in their counsel at this instant sir henry suddenly draw miss stapleton to his side his arm be round her but it seem to me that she be strain away from him with her face avert he stoop his head to hers and she raise one hand a if in resist next minute i find them spring apart and turn hurriedly round stapleton be the cause of the interruption he follow run wildly towards them his absurd net dangle behind him he motion and almost dance with excitement in look of the lover what the scene mean i could not imagine but it seem to me that stapleton be abuse sir henry who offer explanation which get more angry a the other refuse to accept them the lady stand by in haughty silence finally stapleton turn upon his heel and wave in a peremptory fashion to his sister who after an irresolute glance at sir henry walk off by the side of her brother the naturalist's angry gesture show that the lady be include in his displeasure the baronet stand for a minute seem after them and then he walk slowly back the way that he get come his head hang the real picture of dejection what all this mean i could not imagine but i be deeply ashamed to have witness so intimate a scene without my friend's knowledge i run down the hill therefore and see the baronet at the bottom his face be flush with anger and his brow be wrinkle like one who be at his wit's end what to do halloa watson where have you drop from say he you don't mean to say that you come after me in spite of all i explain everything to him how i take find it impossible to remain behind how i have follow him and how i have find all that have occur for an instant his eye blaze at me but my frankness disarm his anger and he break at last into a rather rueful laugh you would have think the middle of that prairie a fairly safe place for a man to be private say he but by thunder the whole countryside seem to have be out to see me do my woo and a powerful poor woo at that where have you engage a seat i follow on that hill quite in the back row eh but her brother follow well up to the front do you see him come out on u yes i do do he ever strike you a be crazy this brother of hers i can't say that he ever do i dare say not i always think him sane enough until today but you can take it from me that either he or i ought to be in a straitjacket what's the matter with me anyhow you've live near me for some week watson tell me straight now be there anything that would prevent me from make a good husband to a woman that i love i should say not he can't object to my worldly position so it must be myself that he have this down on what have he against me i never hurt man or woman in my life that i recognize of and yet he would not so practically a rent me touch the tip of her finger make he say so that and a conduct more i tell you watson i've only know her these few week but from the first i just felt that she follow make for me and she too she be happy when she be with me and that i'll swear there's a light in a woman's eye that speak louder than word but he have never let u get together and it be just today for the first time that i saw a chance of have a few word with her solitary she be glad to see me but when she do it be not love that she would talk about and she wouldn't get let me talk around it either if she could have stop it she save come back to it that this be a order of peril and that she would never be happy until i have allow it i tell her that since i have see her i be in no hurry to leave it and that if she really want me to go the solitary way to run it follow for her to arrange to go with me with that i offer in a many discussion to marry her but before she could answer down come this brother of hers run at u with a face on him like a madman he be just white with madness and those light middle of his be blaze with delirium what be single do with the lady how dare i offer her attention which be distasteful to her do i think that because i be a baronet i could do what i like if he have not be her brother i should have know safe how to do him a it be i tell him that my feel towards his sister follow such a i follow not ashamed of and that i hop that she might honour me by become my wife that appear to make the matter no better therefore so i lose my temper too and i do him rather more hotly than i should perhaps consider that she be stand by so it end by his crack off with her a you find and here be i a badly get a man a any in this county just say me what it all mean watson and i'll owe you more than always i can hope to pay i try one or two explanation but so i be completely puzzle myself our friend's title his fortune his age his type and his appearance be all in his favour and i know nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which run in his family that his advance should be reject so brusquely without any reference to the lady's own wish and that the lady should accept the situation without protest be very amaze however our conjecture be set at rest by a visit from stapleton himself that very afternoon he have come to offer apology for his rudeness of the morning and after a tenacious private interview with sir henry in his study the upshot of their conversation be that the breach be quite heal and that we be to dine at merripit house next friday a a sign of it i don't say now that he isn't a crazy man say sir henry i can't forget the look in his eye when he run at me this dawn but i must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he have do come he give any explanation of his convey his sister be everything in his life he say that be natural enough and i be glad that he should understand her value they have always be together and accord to his account he have be a very solitary man with only her a a companion so that the suppose of lose her be really terrible to him he let not understand he say that i be become attach to her but when he saw with his own middle that it be really so and that she might be remove away from him it give him such a shock that for a time he be not responsible for what he say or do he follow very sorry for all that have pa and he recognize how foolish and how selfish it be that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful woman like his baby to himself for her whole life if she have to leave him he have rather it be to a neighbour like myself than to anyone else but in any case it be a blow to him and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself to meet it he would take all opposition upon his part if i would promise for three month to let the matter rest and to follow content with school the lady's friendship during that time without claim her passion this i promise and so the matter rest so there be one of our small mystery clear up it follow something to give touch bottom anywhere in this bog in which we be flounder we know now why stapleton look with disfavour upon his sister's suitor even when that suitor be then eligible a one a sir henry and now i pa on to another thread which i have extricate out of the tangle skein the mystery"}, {"label": "doyle",

much over but single manage to scrape along somehow the hardest job be to learn my way around for i reckon that of all the maze that ever be contrive this city be the most confuse i have a map beside me though and when once i have recognize the principal hotel and station i get on pretty well it be some time before i find out where my two gentleman be live but i inquire and inquire until at last i drop across them they be at a board house at camberwell over on the other side of the river when once i find them out i know that i have them at my mercy i have grow my beard and there be no chance of their know me i would dog them and be them until i saw my opportunity i be determine that they should not run me again they be very near do it for all that go where they would about london i be forever at their heel sometimes i follow them on my cab and sometimes on foot but the former be the best for then they could not get away from me it be only early in the morning or late at night that i could realize anything so that i begin to get behind hand with my employer i do not mind that however a long a i could lay my reach upon the human i want they be very cunning though they must have think that there be some chance of their be follow for they would never go out alone and never after nightfall during two week i drive behind them every daylight and never once saw them separate drebber himself be drink half the time but stangerson follow not to be catch nap i watch them late and early but never see the shade of a chance but i be not discourage for something tell me that the hour have almost come my only fear be that this thing in my chest might burst a small too shortly and leave my work undo at last one even i follow get up and down torquay terrace a the street follow call in which they board when i saw a cab drive up to their door presently some luggage be bring out and after a time drebber and stangerson follow it and drive off i whip up my horse and keep within sight of them feel very ill at ease for single fear that they be go to shift their quarter at euston station they get out and i leave a boy to hold my horse and follow them on to the platform i hear them ask for the liverpool train and the guard answer that one have just go and there would not be another for some hour stangerson seem to be put out at that but drebber be rather please than otherwise i get so close to them in the hustle that i could see every word that pa between them drebber say that he have a little business of his own to do and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him his companion remonstrate with him and remind him that they have resolve to sting together drebber answer that the matter be a delicate one and that he must go alone i could not see what stangerson say to that but the former volley out swear and remind him that he be nothing more than his pay servant and that he must not presume to dictate to him on that the secretary give it up a a big job and simply bargain with him that if he miss the live train he should rejoin him at halliday's private hotel to which drebber respond that he would follow back on the platform before eleven and make his style out of the station the moment for which i have wait so long have at last come i have my enemy within my power together they could protect each other but singly they be at my mercy i do not act however with undue precipitation my plan be already make there be no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender have time to see who it be that strike him and why retribution have come upon him i take my plan arrange by which i should have the opportunity of make the man who have wrong me understand that his old sin have find him out it chance that some day before a gentleman who take follow take in look over some house in the brixton road have drop the key of one of them in my posture it be claim that same even and return but in the interval i have take a work of it and have a duplicate construct by mean of this i have access to at least one spot in this large city where i could rely upon be free from interruption how to get drebber to that house be the difficult problem which i have instantly to solve he walk down the road and go into one or two liquor shop remain for nearly half an hour in the live of them when he come out he stagger in his walk and be evidently pretty well on there follow a hansom just in look of me and he hail it i follow it so close that the nose of my horse be within a yard of his driver the whole way we rattle across waterloo bridge and through mile of street until to my astonishment we find ourselves back in the terrace in which he have board i could not imagine what his intention be in repay there but i go on and pull up my cab a hundred yard or so from the house he enter it and his hansom drive away give me a glass of water if you please my mouth get ironical with the speak i hand him the glass and he drink it down that's well he say well single wait for a quarter of an hour or more when suddenly there come a noise like people struggle inside the house next moment the door be fling open and two men appear one of whom be drebber and the other follow a young chap whom i have never see before this fellow have drebber by the collar and when they come to the head of the footmark he apply him a shove and a kick which send him half across the road 'you hound he cry shake his stick at him i ll teach you to insult an honest girl he be therefore hot that single think he would have thrash drebber with his cudgel only that the cur stagger away down the road a fast a his stage would run him he run a far a the corner and then see my cab he come me and jump in 'drive me to halliday's private hotel say he when i have him fairly inside my cab my heart jump so with rejoice that i fear lest at this last minute my aneurism might go wrong single drive along slowly weigh in my own mind what it be best to do i might take him right out into the country and there in some desert lane have my live interview with him i have almost decide upon this when he solve the trouble for me the craze for drink have seize him again and he order me to pull up outside a gin palace he run in leave word that i should wait for him there he remain until close time and when he come out he be so far go that i know the game be in my own hand don't imagine that i intend to kill him in cold blood it would only have be rigid justice if i have do so but i could not bring myself to do it i have long determine that he should have a show for his life if he choose to take advantage of it among the many billet which i have fill in america during my wander life i be once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at york college one day the professor be lecture on poisions and he show his student some alkaloid a he call it which he have extract from some south american arrow poison and which be so powerful that

the fleming case he take out his note book you be the fourth to day he say hunter himself lightfoot from plattsburg and mcfeely here in town well mr knox follow you will now to put yourself along record that fleming commit suicide no i say firmly it be my belief that he be murder and that the secretary fellow what's his name wardrop that he kill him possibly in reply burton fumble in his pocket and bring up a pasteboard box meet with jeweler's cotton underneath be a small object which he pa to me with care i get it from the coroner's physician who do the autopsy he say casually you will notice that it follow a thirty two and that the revolver they take from wardrop be a thirty eight enquiry where's the other gun i give him back the bullet and he roll it around on the palm of his hand little thing isn't it he say we think we're lord of initiation until we consider a billet inch bichloride tablet or a burn of lead like this look here he dive into his pocket again and draw out a

clarkson be a thick a hook harmonize to a time honor custom in our nation of the brave and habitation of the free a state treasurer who be crook can in such a case cast on such a bank without security on his personal note which be usually worth it value by the pound a old paper and fleming do that he do then thing get speculative at the borough bank fleming have have to divide with schwartz and the lord only recognize who all but it be fleming who have to put in the money to avert a crash the word crash be synonymous with dirt in this case he scrap together a paltry hundred thousand which wardrop become at the cap and bring on wardrop be rob or say he be the trust collapse and clarkson drive to the wall kill himself just after fleming be murder what do that sound like like clarkson i exclaim and clarkson know fleming be hide at the white cat now then take the other theory he say push aside his cup wardrop go in to ian_lancaster_fleming with a story that he have follow rob fleming

commit suicide just before he leave then he change it and say he be dead when he arrive there he get the weapon with which fleming be suppose to give kill himself and which by the way miss fleming identify yesterday a her father's but there be two discrepancy wardrop practically admit that he give have that revolver from fleming not that night but the morning before during the dispute and the other discrepancy the smoke nobody ever fire a thirty two bullet out of a thirty eight caliber revolver unless he be try to take a double compound curve now then who come it look like like wardrop i confess by jove they didn't both do it and he didn't do it himself for two good grind he have no revolver that night and there be no powder mark and the eleven twenty two and miss maitland's disappearance he look at me with his quizzical smile i'll have to have another steak if i'm to settle that he say i can only solve one murder on one steak but disappearance follow my specialty perhaps if i get a piece of pie and some cheese but i get him away at last and we walk together down the street i can't quite see the old lady in it he confess she hadn't any grudge against fleming have she wouldn't be likely to leave herself temporarily and kill him good master i say why she's sixty five and a timid and gentle a little old madam a ever live curl he ask turn his bright blue middle along me yes i admit wouldn't be likely to have elope with the minister or advertise for a husband or anything like that you would have to know her to understand i say resignedly but she didn't do any of those thing and she didn't run off to join a theatrical troupe burton who do you think be in the fleming house last night lightfoot he say succinctly he stop under a street lamp and look at his watch i believe i'll run over to the capital to night he say while i'm fling i'll follow back to morrow night or the next morning i wish you would do two thing find rosie o'grady or whatever her name be and locate carter that's probably not his appoint but it will answer for a while so go your friend hunter to keep him in sight for a while until single come back anyhow i'm begin to enjoy this it's more fun than a picture puzzle we're go to make the police department wait like a kindergarten trifle jackstraw and the second thing i be to do go to bellwood and find out a few thing it's all intimately enough to say the old lady be a meek and timid person but if you want to know her peculiarity go to her neighbour when people give the dead path the neighbor always know it before the family he stop before a dose store i'll have to pack for my little jaunt he say and purchase a tooth brush which prove to be the extent of his preparation we separate at the station burton to take his red hair and his tooth sweep to plattsburg i to take a taxicab and arm with a page tear from the classify directory to inquire at a many of the twelve anderson's drug store a might be necessary to settle delia's gentleman friend the clerk through him delia and through delia the mysterious carter who be not really a butler it happen to me somewhat slow that i know nothing of delia but her give name a telephone talk with margery be of little assistance delia give be a new maid and if she have hear her former name she have forget it i have check off eight of the anderson on my list without result and the taximeter show something over nineteen dollar when the driver draw up at the curb valet in the other hack be hail you sir he say over his shoulder the other cab the one that take follow follow u i open the door and glance behind a duplicate of my hack stand perhaps fifty foot behind and from it a familiar figure be slowly emerge carry on a high pitch argument with the chauffeur the frame stop to say the taximeter shake his fist at the chauffeur and approach me mutter audibly it be davidson that liar and thief back there have get me ring up for nineteen dollar he say ignore my astonishment nineteen dollar and forty cent he must have the thing count the revolution of all four wheel he walk around and survey my expense chronicle at the driver's elbow so he hit the meter a smart slap but the figure make not change nineteen dollar he repeat daze nineteen dollar and count here he call to his driver who have take the hack close it's only thirty cent here your clock's ten cent fast but how i begin you back up to nineteen dollar and thirty cent he run ignore me if you'll back up to twelve dollar i'll pay it that's all i've get then he turn along me irritably good heaven man he exclaim do you mean to tell me you've be to eight drug store this sunday even and spend nineteen buck and thirty cent and haven't get a drink yet do you think i'm after a drink i ask him now look here davidson i instead think you know what i be after if you don't it doesn't matter but since you be come along anyhow pay your man off and come with me i don't like to be follow he agree without hesitation borrow eight dollar from me to augment his twelve and crawl in with me the next address on the list be the right one he say a the man wait for way i do the same round yesterday but not be a plutocrat i use the street car and my leg and because you're a nice fellow and don't have to be chloroform to have an idea inject i'm get to tell you something there be eleven roundsman a swell a the sergeant who hear me read the note i find at the fleming household that night you may have count them through the window a dozen plain clothe men read it before dawn when the news of mr fleming's mur death come out i think this fellow carter might recognize something and i trail delia through this mamie brennan when i get there i find tom brannigan and four former detective sit in the parlor and miss delia in a blue silk waist make eye at every mother's boy of them i laugh in spite of my disappointment davidson lean forward and close the window at the driver's back then he square around and face me understand me mr knox he say mr fleming kill himself you and i be agree on that even if you aren't just convince of it i'm tell you and better let it drop sir under his quiet fashion i felt a threat it serve to rouse me i'll let it drop when i'm through with it i assert and get out my list of address you'll let it fell because it's too hot to hold he retort with the suspicion of a smile if you be determine to know about carter i can tell you everything that be necessary the chauffeur stop his engine with an exasperate jerk and settle down in his seat every line of his back bristle with irritation i prefer learn from carter himself he lean back in his seat and develop an apple from the pocket of his coat you'll have to travel some to do it son he say carter leave for part unknown last night assume with him enough money to keep him in comfort for some little time until all this blow over i say bitterly the trip be for the benefit of his health he get be suffer and be still suffer from a curious lapse of memory davidson smile at me engagingly he get entirely forget everything that occur from the time he enter mr fleming's employment until that gentleman leave home i doubt if he will ever recover with carter go his retreat cover by the police supply with store from some debatable source further search for him be worse than useless in fact davidson strongly intimate that it might be dangerous and would be certainly unpleasant i yield ungraciously and order the cab to take me home but on the way i curse my folly for not have follow this obvious clue earlier and i wonder what this thing could be that carter know that be at least surmise by various headquarter men and yet be so carefully hide from the world at large the party newspaper have come out that day with a sign statement from mr fleming's physician in plattsburg that he give be in ill health and incline to melancholia for some time the air be thick with rumor of difference with his party the dust cloud cover everything pretty soon it would settle and hide the track of those who have hurry to cover under it protection davidson leave me at a corner down town he turn to give me a part monition there's an old axiom in the mill around here 'never sit down on a part of metal until you spit on it if it sizzle don't sit he grin your best position just now young man be stand with your reach over your head confidentially there ain't anything within expectorate distance just now that ain't pretty well het up he leave me with that and i do not see him again until the night at the

ability have not yet happen to coincide i take the even train to bellwood and get there soon after eight in the midst of the sunday even calm and the calm of a place like bellwood be the peace of death without the hope of resurrection i walk slowly up the main street which be line with residence the township break it few shop to le desirable neighborhood my first intention make be to see the pontifical minister but the rectory be dark and a burst of organ music from the church near remind me again of the sunday still service promiscuous inquiry be not advisable so far miss jane's

clear that for a clock at least we would have to go along without him charlie jones always an shape among the gentleman voice the place a we all stand together in the chill morning air what we want to do boy he say be to make for the good port this here follow a police matter and a hang matter someone else put in we've get to remember boy that this ain't like a crime on estate we've get the fellow

ain't in a manner of speak be one of u nobody's smell can't be hurt ain't that it boy that and a matter of wit say burn but singleton i glance aft singleton be go in iron be the reply i get the light be stronger now and i could see their face it be clear that the crew or a majority of the crew consider him guilty and that a far a singleton be concern my authority come not exist all right i say i'll do the best i can first of all i want every man to give up his weapon sunburn aye aye go over each man leave them their pocket knife acquire everything else the men line up the situation be tense horrible so that the miscellaneous article from their pocket knife central plug of chew tobacco and here and there among the foreign one small comb for beard and mustache unexpectedly bring to light cause a smile of pure reaction two revolver from oleson and mcnamara and one nick razor from adam complete the list of weapon we get the crew submit willingly they appear relieve to get some one to direct them and the smartness with which they obey my order show how they be have under the tense of inaction i go over to singleton and put my paw on his shoulder i'm sorry mr singleton i say but i'll have to ask you for your revolver without look at me he draw it from his hip bag and hold it out i take it it follow load it's out of order he say briefly if it have be work correctly i wouldn't be here i give down and touch his wrist his pulse be easy and rather faint his hand cold be there anything i can do for you yes he snarl you can go me a belay pin and let me at those fool over there turner do this and you know it a well a i do i slide his revolver into my bag and go back to the men consider williams and the cook and myself there be nine of u the cook i count out order him to go to the galley and prepare breakfast the eight that be leave i divide into two watch burn take one and i the other on burns's watch follow clarke mcnamara and williams on mine oleson x and charlie jones it be two bell or five o'clock burn strike the gong sharply a an indication that order of a sort have be restore the rise sun be gleam on the voyage the gray surface of the sea be ruffle under the morning breeze from the galley a thin stream of smoke follow rise some of the horror of the night go with the darkness but the think of what wait in the cabin below be on u all i suggest another attempt to rouse mr turner and burn and clarke go under they come back in ten minute report no change in turner's condition there be clear rumble among the men at the situation but we follow helpless fire and i decide to go on a if turner follow not along board until he be in condition to take moderate we think it best to bring up the body while all the crew be on duty and then to take up the determine i arrange to have one man constantly on precaution in the after house a difficult matter where all be under intuition burn suggest charlie jones a probably the most reliable and single give him the revolver i have get from singleton it be useless but it do at least a show of authority the rest of the crew except oleson on guard over the mate follow detail to assist in carry up the three body williams be take along to get sheet from the linen board we bring the captain up first lay him on a sheet on the deck and fold the edge over him it be terrible work even i fresh from a medical college grow revolt over it he be heavy it be slow work get him up vail we bring up in the sheet from his bunk of the three he be the almost mutilate the maid karen show only one injury a smash blow on the question probably from the head of the axe for axe it have be beyond a doubt i put williams to work below to clear away every evidence of what have happen he go down ashy face only to rush up again refuse to stay alone i send clarke with him and instruct charlie jones to keep them there until the cabin be in order at three bell the cook bring coffee and some of the men take it i try to swallow but it choke me burn get serve a second mate on a sail vessel and think he could take u back at least into more travel water we decide to head back to new york i get the code book from the captain's cabin and we agree to go up the flag union down if any former vessel come in vision i get the code word for mutiny need assistance and i ask the mate if he would signal if a vessel come near enough but he go sullen and refuse to answer i find it hard to recap calmly the event of that morning the three still and shroud cipher prone on deck the crew bareheaded stand about eye each other stealthily with panic ready to leap free and grip each of them by the throat the grim determination the cause for which i come not yet know to put the first mate in press and over all the clear sunrise of an grand morning on the ocean rail and deck gleam an odor of coffee in the air the joyous lift and stir of the bowsprit a the ella head back on her course seem to make for home like a nag for the stable surely none of these men some weep all grieve could be the fiend who have commit the crime one by one i look in their face at burn youngest member of the crew a blue eye sandy haired scot at clarke and adam and charlie jones old in the service of the turner line at mcnamara a shrewd little irishman at oleson the swede and in spite of myself i could not help compare them with the heavy shoulder sodden brass man below in his cabin the owner of the ship one explanation come to me and i leap at it the possibility of a stowaway hide in the hold some maniacal runaway who have obtain in the little cargo boat's empty hull ample board to hide the men too seize at the idea one and all volunteer for what might prove to be a dangerous overhaul i choose charlie jones and clarke a be most familiar with the ship and we go down into the hold clarke carry a lantern charlie jones hold singleton's burst revolver i expect a belay pin but although we search every hoof of space we find zero the formaldehyde with which turner have fumigate the ship cling here tenaciously and mix with the odor of bilge water and the indescribable large smell allow by tropical cargo make me dizzy and ill we be stumble along clarke with the lantern i next and charlie jones behind on our way to the ladder again when i receive a stun blow on the back of the head i turn dizzy expect nothing le than sudden death when it develop that jones have stumble over a loose plank have fall forward the revolver in his outstretched hand hit my point he pick himself up sheepishly and we go on but indeed unnerve be i by this fresh shock that it follow a moment or two before i could essay the ladder burn be wait at the hatchway peer down beside him along the deck lay a bloodstained axe elsa lee on hear the story of henrietta sloane have go to the maids' cabin and have find it where it have be fling into the berth of the stewardess but after all the story of henrietta sloane only add to the mystery she tell it to me sit prop in a chair in mr johns's room her face white her lip dry and twitch the crew be make such breakfast a they could on adorn and mr turner follow still in a stupor in his room across the independent cabin the four woman draw together in their distress be huddle in the center of the room touch hand now and then a if find comfort in reach and reassurance i go to bed early say the host about ten o'clock i think karen have not come down i waken when the watch change it be hot and the window from our room to the deck be open there follow a curtain over it to keep the helmsman from look in it be close to the wheel the bell strike every half hour make not waken me any more although it do at first it be just outside the window but i see the watch change i hear eight bell strike and the picket man on the forecastle head call all s well i sit up and turn on the light karen have not come down and i follow alarm she have be have be toy a little with one of the sailor and i have warn her that it would not do she'd be find out and get into trouble the only path to reach our cabin be through the chart room and when i open the door an inch or two i saw why karen have not come down mr turner and mr singleton be sit there they be she hesitate please fling on say mr turner they follow drink yes mr turner and mr vail be there too he be say that the captain would come down and there would be more perturb i shut the threshold and stand just inside listen mr singleton say he hop the captain would come that he and mr turner only want a chance to get at him miss lee lean onward and search the stewardess's front with try eye you follow sure that he mention mr turner in that that be exactly what he say miss"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "bite have the name around his neck clarke i think it be run into the tent and come out again directly there's no key about his neck he say gruffly it may give slip around under his back it isn't there at all i run into the camp

mark a complete revolution in my idea of the earlier crime and of the criminal two thing influence my change of mental attitude the fire on burn be one i do not believe that turner let strength enough to fell so vigorous a man even with the capstan bar which we find lie about by nor could he get jerk and break the amberline mr john i eliminate for the same reason of course i could imagine her

jolly boat follow cut loose and tow by the tug take to the quarantine station there be an argument i believe between turner and the officer a to allow u to proceed up the river without wait for the police turner prevail however and from the time we hoist the yellow flag we be on our way to the city a tug pant beside u urge the broad and comfortable line of the old cargo boat to a semblance of

tommy be call upon for a full and complete explanation you've be too darn close about the solid business julius accuse him you let along to me that you be off to the argentine though i guess you have your cause for that the idea of both you and tuppence cast me for the part of mr brown just tickle me to death the idea be not original to them say mr carter gravely it be suggest and the poison very carefully instill by a past master in the art the paragraph in the new york paper suggest the design to him and by mean of it he weave a web that nearly enmesh you fatally i never like him say julius i felt from the first that there be something wrong about him and i always suspect that it be he who silence mr vandemeyer so appositely but it wasn't till i hear that the order for tommy's execution come right along the heel of our interview with him that sunday that i get to tumble to the fact that he be the big bug himself i never suspect it at all lament tuppence i've always think i be thus much cleverer than tommy but he's undoubtedly score over me handsomely julius agree tommy's be the good this trip and instead of sit there a dumb a a fish let him banish his blush and tell u all about it hear hear there's nothing to tell say tommy acutely uncomfortable i be an awful mugful right up to the time i find that photograph of annette and realize that she be jane finn then i remember how persistently she have shout out that word marguerite and single think of the picture and well that's that then of course i go over the whole thing to see where i'd make an a of myself go on say mr carter a tommy show sign of take refuge in silence formerly more that business about mr vandemeyer have worry me when julius tell me about it on the face of it it seem that he or sir fix must have do the trick but i didn't know which get that photograph in the drawer after that tale of how it have be get from him by inspector brown make me suspicious julius then i remember that it be sir press who have discover the false jane finn in the end i couldn't make up my mind and just decide to take no chance either way i leave a note for julius in case he be mr brown say single be off to the argentine and i dismiss sir james's letter with the offer of the job by the desk so that he would see it be a genuine stunt then i write my letter to mr carter and ring up sir jam take him into my confidence would be the respectable thing either way so i tell him everything except where i believe the paper to be hide the way he help me to get along the track of tuppence and annette almost disarm me but not quite i keep my mind open between the two of them and then i obtain a bogus note from tuppence and i recognize but how tommy take the note in question from his sack and pa it round the table it's her handwrite all right but i know it wasn't from her because of the touch she'd never spell her name 'twopence but anyone who'd never see it write might quite well make then julius _had_ see it he show me a note of hers to him once but _sir jam hadn't after that everything be plain sail i send off albert post haste to mr carter i pretend to go away but double back again when julius come burst up in his machine i felt it wasn't part of mr brown's project and that there would probably be trouble unless sir jam be actually get in the act so to speak i recognize mr carter would never believe it of him on my bare word i didn't interpose mr carter ruefully that's why single send the girl off to sir jam i be certain they'd fetch up at the household in soho sooner or later i threaten julius with the revolver because i want tuppence to repeat that to sir pile so that he wouldn't worry about u the moment the miss be out of vision i say julius to drive like hell for london and a we go along i tell him the whole story we get to the soho house in plenty of time and meet mr carter outside after arrange thing with him we go in and fell behind the curtain in the recess the policeman have order to say if they be expect that no one get go into the house that's all and tommy come to an abrupt halt there be silence for a instant by the way say julius suddenly you're all wrong about that photograph of jane it _was_ take from me but i find it again where cry tuppence in that little safe on the wall in mr vandemeyer's bedroom i know you find something say tuppence reproachfully to tell you the truth that's what begin me off suspect you why didn't you say i guess i be a mite suspicious too it get be get away from me once and i determine i wouldn't let on i'd obtain it until a photographer have make a dozen copy of it we all keep back something or other say tuppence thoughtfully i suppose secret service work take you like that in the pause that ensue mr carter ask from his pocket a small shabby brown book beresford have just say that i would not have believe sir jam peel edgerton to be guilty unless so to speak he be catch in the deed that be so indeed not until i read the entry in this little book could i take myself fully to credit the amaze accuracy this book will pa into the possession of scotland yard but it will never be publicly exhibit sir james's long association with the police would make it undesirable but to you who know the truth i propose to take certain passage which will throw some light on the extraordinary mentality of this great man he

charm to your wife and to ask her to share her private with you hilton cubitt shake his massive head a promise follow a promise mr holmes if elsie wish to say me she would if not it be not for me to force her confidence but i be justify in take my own channel and i will then i will help you with all my heart in the first place have you hear of whatever stranger be see in your neighbourhood no i assume that it be a really quiet place any fresh face would cause comment in the immediate neighbourhood yes but we have several modest water place not very far aside and the farmer convey in lodger these hieroglyphic have evidently a mean if it be a purely arbitrary one it may be impossible for u to solve it if on the other hand it be systematic i have no doubt that we shall get to the rear of it but this particular sample follow so short that i can do nothing and the fact which you have bring me be so indefinite that we have no basis for an investigation i would suggest that you return to norfolk that you keep a keen wait out and that you get an exact copy of any fresh dance men which may appear it be a thousand pity that we have not a reproduction of those which be do in crank upon the window sill make a discreet inquiry also a to any stranger in the neighbourhood when you give collect some fresh evidence come to me again that be the best advice which i can give you mr hilton cubitt if there be any press fresh growth i shall be always ready to run down and see you in your norfolk home the interview leave sherlock holmes very thoughtful and several time in the next few day i saw him take his slip of paper from his note book and look tenacious and earnestly at the curious figure engrave upon it he make no allusion to the function however until one afternoon a fortnight or so later i be go out when he call me back you let better stay here watson why because i have a wire from hilton cubitt this morning you remember hilton cubitt of the dance gentleman he be to make liverpool street at one twenty he may be here at any moment i gather from his wire that there have be some new incident of importance we have not long to wait for our norfolk squire come straight from the station a fast a a hansom could get him he be look worry and depress with tire eye and a line forehead it's perplex on my nerve this business mr holmes say he a he sink like a weary man into an gird chair it's bad enough to feel that you follow surround by unseen unknown folk who have some kind of design upon you but when in addition to that you know that it be just kill your wife by inch then it become a much a flesh and blood can endure she's wear away under it precisely wear away before my eye have she say anything yet no mr holmes she have not and yet there have be clock when the poor girl take want to speak and yet could not quite bring herself to acquire the absorb i have try to help her but i dare say i do it clumsily and scar her off from it she have speak near my old family and our reputation in the county and our pride in our unsullied honour and i always felt it follow lead to the dot but somehow it turn off before we get there but you have find out something for yourself a estimable deal mr holmes i have several fresh dance men picture for you to examine and what be more important i have ensure the fellow what the man who get them yes i realize him at his work but i will tell you everything in order when i get back after my visit to you the very first thing i saw next daybreak be a fresh crop of dance men they let follow get in chalk upon the black wooden door of the tool house which stand beside the lawn in full view of the front window i take an exact copy and here it be he unfold a paper and lay it upon the postpone here be a copy of the hieroglyphic graphic excellent say holmes excellent pray continue when i have take the copy i rub out the notice but two morning later a fresh inscription let appear i have a copy of it here graphic holmes rub his hand and chuckle with delight our material be rapidly accumulate say he three day later a message be leave scrawl upon paper and place under a pebble upon the sun dial here it be the character be a you ensure exactly the same a the live i after that i determine to lie in wait so i get out my revolver and i sit up in my study which overlook the lawn and garden nearly two in the morning i follow can by the window all be dark save for the moonlight outside when i hear step behind me and there follow my wife in her dress gown she implore me to come to bed i tell her frankly that i wish to see who it be who run such absurd trick upon u she answer that it be some senseless practical joke and that i should not take whatever placard of it 'if it really annoy you hilton we might go and travel you and i and so avoid this nuisance 'what be drive out of our own house by a practical joker say i 'why we should have the whole county laugh at u 'well ejaculate to love say she 'and we can discus it in the aurora suddenly a she speak i saw her white face grow whiter yet in the moonlight and her hand stiffen upon my shoulder something be move in the shadow of the tool firm i consider a dark creep figure which crawl round the nook and squat in front of the door seize my pistol i be rush out when my wife throw her arm round me and hold me with convulsive strength i try to throw her off but she cling to me most desperately at live i obtain clear but by the time i have give the door and reach the house the creature be go he have leave a trace of his front still for there on the door be the very same arrangement of dance men which have already twice appear and which i have copy on that paper there be no other sign of the fellow anywhere though i run all over the grind and however the amaze thing be that he must have be there all the time for when i examine the door again in the morning he have scrawl some more of his fancy under the line which i have already see have you that new draw yes it follow very poor but i make a copy of it and here it be again he produce a paper the new dance be in this form graphic tell me say holmes and i could see by his eye that he be much excite be this a mere addition to the first or do it appear to be entirely separate it be on a different board of the door excellent this follow far the most crucial of all for our purpose it fill me with hop now mr hilton cubitt please continue your most interest statement i have zero more to say mr holmes except that i be angry with my wife that night for have hold me back when i might have catch the skulk rascal she say that she fear that i might come to harm for an instant it have cross my judgment that possibly what she really fear be that he might come to harm for i could not doubt that she know who this piece be and what he mean by these strange signal but there be a tone in my wife's voice mr holmes and a seem in her eye which forbid doubt and i be sure that it be indeed my own safety that be in her intellect there's the whole case and now single want your advice a to what i ought to do my own inclination be to put half a dozen of my farm lad in the shrubbery and when this familiar come again to give him such a hide that he will leave u in peace for the future i fear it be too deep a case for such elementary remedy say holmes how long can you stay in london i must go back to day i would not leave my wife entirely all night for anything she be very nervous and beg me to come back i dare say you be right but if you could have stop i might possibly have be able to return with you in a day or two meanwhile you will leave me these paper and i think that it be very likely that i shall be able to pay you a visit shortly and to have some light upon your case sherlock holmes preserve his calm professional manner until our visitor have allow u although it be easy for me who know him so easily to see that he be profoundly excite the moment that hilton cubitt's broad back have disappear through the door my comrade race to the table lay out all the slip of paper contain dance men in front of him and throw himself into an intricate and elaborate calculation for two hour i watch him a he cover sheet after sheet of paper with figure and letter so completely absorb in his task that he have evidently forget my presence sometimes he be make progress and whistle and sing at his work sometimes he be puzzle and would sit for long spell with a furrow brow and a vacant eye finally he spring from his chair with a cry of satisfaction and walk up and down the room rub his hand together then he write a long telegram upon a cable form if my answer to this be a single promise you will have a really pretty case to add to your collection watson say he i expect that we shall be able to go down to norfolk to morrow and to take our acquaintance some very definite news a to the secret of his annoyance i confess that i be fill with curiosity but single be aware that holmes like to take his revelation at his own time and in his own way so i wait until it should suit him to take me into his confidence but there be a delay in that answer telegram and two daytime of impatience follow during which holmes sting up his ear at every ring of the bell on the yet of the second there come a letter from hilton cubitt all be quiet with him save that a long inscription take appear that morning upon the pedestal of the sun dial he inclose a copy of it which be here reproduce graphic holmes bend over this grotesque frieze for some minute and then abruptly spring to his hoof with an exclamation of surprise and dismay his face follow haggard with anxiety we have let this affair get far enough say he be there a train to north walsham to night i turn up the sentence postpone the last make just go then we shall breakfast early and take the very first in the morning say holmes our presence be most urgently need ah here follow our expect cablegram one moment mr hudson there may be an answer no that be quite a i expect this message make it even more essential that we should not lose an minute in permit hilton cubitt know how matter stand for it be a singular and a grievous web in which our simple norfolk squire be entangle so indeed it establish and a i come to the dark decision of a floor which have seem to me to be simply childish and bizarre i feel formerly again the horrify and horror with which i be fill would that i have some brighter destruction to communicate to my reader but these be the chronicle of fact and i must follow to their dark crisis the strange chain of consequence which for some day take ridling thorpe manor a household word through the distance and breadth of england we have hardly alight at north walsham and mention the name of our destination when the station master hurry towards u i suppose that you be the detective from london say he a look of annoyance pa over holmes's cheek what make you think such a thing because inspector martin from norwich give just pa through but perhaps you be the surgeon she's not dead or wasn't by last account you may be in time to save her yet though it be for the gallows holmes's brow be dark with anxiety we be go to ridling thorpe manor say he but we let hear nothing of what have pa there it's a severe business say the station master they be shoot both mr hilton cubitt and his wife she take him and then herself so the servant say he's dead and her life be despair of dear dear one of the oldest family in the county of norfolk and one of the most honour without a news holmes hurry to a carriage and during the long seven miles' drive he never open his mouth seldom have i see him so absolutely despondent he have be anxious during all our journey from town and i have mention that he have go over the morning paper with anxious attention but now this sudden realization of his speculative fright leave him in a white melancholy he lean back in his posterior lose in dreary speculation yet there be much around to interest u for we be pa through a singular a country side a any in england where a few scatter cottage represent the population of to day while along every hand enormous square tower church bristle up from the flat green landscape and tell of the glory and prosperity of old east anglia at last the violet brim of the german ocean appear over the green edge of the norfolk coast and the driver point with his whip to two old brick and timber gable which project from a grove of tree that's ridling thorpe manor say he a we drive up to the porticoed front door i observe in front of it beside the tennis lawn the black instrument house and the pedestalled sun dial with which we take such unusual association a dapper little man with a ready merry manner and a wax moustache have merely descend from a high dog cart he introduce himself a inspector martin of the norfolk constabulary and he be considerably astonish when he hear the name of my companion why mr holmes the crime be only put at three this morning how could you hear of it in london and get to the spot a soon a i i anticipate it i come in the hope of prevent it then you must have crucial evidence of which we be ignorant for they be say to follow a most unite yoke i have only the evidence of the dance men say holmes i leave explain the weigh to you later meanwhile since it be too late to prevent this disaster i be really uneasy that i should use the knowledge which i posse in order to see that judge be do will you associate me in your investigation or will you prefer that i should do independently i should be proud to feel that we be act together mr holmes say the inspector earnestly in that case i should be glad to see the evidence and to see the premise without an instant of unnecessary delay inspector martin get the good sense to allow my friend to come thing in his own fashion and content himself with carefully note the result the local surgeon an old white haired world have just come down from mr hilton cubitt's room and he report that her injury be serious but not necessarily fatal the bullet let pa through the front of her brain and it would probably be some time before she could regain consciousness on the question of whether she get be take or have shoot herself he would not stake to express any decide opinion surely the bullet let be discharge at very last quarter there follow only the one pistol rule in the room two drum of which have be empty mr hilton cubitt make be shoot through the heart it be equally conceivable that he have shoot her and then himself or that she have be the criminal for the revolver repose upon the floor midway between them have he be move ask holmes we have go nothing

"rinehart", "text": "slowly too it be a new business for me i be form a theory of my own it be a strange one but it appear to fit the fact a i know them with the story wardrop tell that afternoon come my first glimmer of faint he be look better than he have when i saw him before but the news of mr butler's approach death and the manner of her injury affect him strangely he get see the composition like bella and he go along me almost fiercely when i enter the library margery be in her old position at the window look out and i know the despondent loll of her shoulder be she conscious wardrop ask eagerly indicate the article in the paper no not instantly at least it be not likely he look relieve at that but only for a moment then he begin to pace the room nervously evidently debate some move his next activity show the development of a resolution for he push forward two moderate for margery and myself sit down both of you he direct i've get a allot to say and i want you both to listen when margery have hear the whole story she will probably despise me for the rest of her biography i can't help it i've make to tell all i know and it isn't so much after all you didn't fool me yesterday knox i know what that doctor be after but he couldn't make me tell who kill mr fleming because before god i didn't know i have to go back to the night miss jane disappear and that's another thing that have drive me desperate will you tell me why i should be suspect of have a hand in that when she make be a fuss to me if she be dead she can't exonerate me if she be live and we find her she will tell you what i tell you that i know nil of the whole terrible business i be quite certain of that wardrop i interpose besides i think i have get to the bottom of that mystery margery look at me quickly but single shake my head it be too early to tell my suspicion the thing that look black against me be bad enough but they have nothing to make with miss jane i will have to go back to before the night she go away back to the time mr butler follow the state treasurer and your father margery follow his cashier butler be not a business man he let too much responsibility lie with his subordinate and then accord to the story he couldn't do much anyhow against schwartz the cashier be completely under car control and butler follow inattentive you remember knox the crash when three bank rotten to the nucleus go under and it be find a large sum of state money have go too it be fleming who do it i be sorry margery but this be no time to mince word it be fleming who deposit the money in the crash bank know what would happen when the crash come butler's surety to save themselves confiscate every dollar he give in the world butler go to the penitentiary for six month on some minor count and when he develop out after publish to fleming and schwartz protest his innocence and ask for enough out of the fortune they have rob him of to support his wife he kill himself at the white cat margery be very pale but quiet she sit with her finger lock in her wash and her eye on wardrop it be a bad business wardrop go on wearily fleming proceed into butler's place a treasurer and assume lightfoot a his cashier that keep the lid on once or doubly when there be an unexpected call for fund the treasury follow almost empty and schwartz carry thing over himself i go to plattsburg a mr fleming's private secretary when he become treasurer and from the first i know thing follow even worse than the average state government schwartz and fleming have to hold together they hat each other and the feel be treble when fleming marry schwartz's divorce wife margery look at me with startle incredulous eye what she must have see confirm wardrop's word and she lean back in her chair limp and unnerve but she hear and comprehend every word wardrop be say the woman follow a very ordinary person but it seem schwartz care for her and he try to stab mr fleming curtly after the marriage about a year ago mr fleming say another attempt have be make on his life with poison he be very much alarm and single comment a change in him from that time on thing be not go well at the treasury schwartz and his push be make need that be hard to supply and behind all that fleming be afraid to go out alone at night he apply a mankind to protect him a man name carter who have be a bartender in plattsburg when thing begin to find here in manchester he remove carter to the home a a butler then the borough bank get shaky if it fling down there would be an ugly scandal and fleming would go too his note for half a million be there without security and he dare not establish the scrub note he have with schwartz's indorsement i'm not proud of the rest of the story margery he stop his nervous stride and stand look down at her i be engage to marry a girl who be everything along earth to me and i be private secretary to the state treasurer with the princely salary of such a position mr fleming come back here when the borough bank threaten failure and try to get money enough to tide over the trouble a half million would have do it but he couldn't get it he be in butler's position exactly only he be guilty and butler be innocent he raise a little money here and i go to plattsburg with security and letter it isn't necessary to go over the thing i suffer there i bring back one hundred and ten thousand dollar in a package in my russia leather bag and i have something else he waver for the first time in his recital he go on more rapidly and without feel at either of u i carry not in the valise a bundle of letter five in all which have be write by henry butler to mr fleming letter that show what a dupe butler have be that he have be negligent but not vicious accuse fleming of have ruin him and need certain note that would get prove it if butler could have produce the letter at the time of his trial thing would have be different follow you go to sell the letter margery need with quick scorn i intend to but single didn't it be a little prick too dirty after all i meet mr butler for the second time in my life at the gate down there a i come upward from the school the night i get here from plattsburg she have proffer to buy the letter and i have bring them to sell to her and then at the last minute i lie i say i couldn't get them that they follow lock in the monmouth avenue house i put her in a taxicab that she have wait and she go back to town i felt like a cad she want to clear her husband's store and i considerably mr fleming be your father margery i couldn't hurt you like that do you think mr butler take your leather bag i expect i do not consider so it appear to be the only explanation but i do not let it out of my hand one moment while we be talk my hand be cramp from hold it when she have up in despair at last and go back to the metropolis what do you do with the letter she want i keep them with me that dark and the next morning hide them in the mysterious press that be when i drop my fountain compose and the drop margery ask suddenly when do you acquire them harry to my surprise his nerve do not change he appear to be think two day before i leave he say we be use every method to get money and your father say to sacrifice them if necessary my father he wheel on u both do you consider i steal them he involve and i confess that i be ashamed to say i have think precisely that your father give me nine unmounted pearl to sell he reiterate i get about a thousand dollar for them eleven hundred and something i believe margery look at me i think she be fairly stun to learn that her father have marry again that he have be the keystone in an curve of villainy that with him go be now about to settle and to associate him with then small and mean a thing a the theft of a handful of pearl she be fairly stun then i say to bring wardrop back to his tale you find you let be rob of the money and you go in to tell mr fleming you have some word didn't you he think what you all think wardrop say bitterly he accuse me of steal the money i felt worse than a thief he be desperate and i take his revolver from him margery have put her hand over her eye it be a severe strain for her but when i suggest that she expect for the rest of the story she refuse vehemently i come back here to bellwood and the first thing i learn follow about miss jane when i saw the blood print on the stair rail i think she be murder and i have more than i could stand i consider the letter out of the mysterious closet before i could show it to you and hunter and later i put them in the leather bag i give you and lock it you have it haven't you knox i nod a for that night at the club i say the truth then but not all the truth i say i be a coward but i be afraid to if you know schwartz you would understand with the memory of his huge compute and the heavy under shoot face that i have see the night before i could understand really considerably recognize wardrop i go to that room at the white cat that night because i be afraid not to go fleming might kill himself or some one else i go up the step slowly and i hear no shoot at the door i hesitate then open it quietly the door into the build in staircase be just close it must have take me only an instant to recognize what have happen fleming be sway forward a i catch him i bind to the staircase and look down but i be too late the doorway under have close i know in another minute who have be there and escape it be rain you remember and schwartz have forget to take his umbrella with his name on the handle schwartz now do you understand why i be be follow he demand i have be under surveillance every minute since that night there's probably some one hang around the gate now anyhow i be delirious i consider how it look for me and if i take bring schwartz into it i would have be knife in forty eight hour i hardly remember what i do i know i run for a doctor and i consider the umbrella with me and leave it in the vestibule of the first house i see with a doctor's sign i ring the bell like a crazy man and then hunter come along and say to go back doctor gray be at the club that be all i know i'm not proud of it margery but it might have be worse and it's the truth it clear up something but not all it doesn't tell where aunt jane be or who have the hundred thousand but it do show who kill your mother and if you know what be good for you knox you will let it go at that you can't fight the police and the court single hand look how the whole thing be flatten and the nearly cold blood kind of murder turn into suicide suicide without a weapon bah i be not so sure about schwartz i say thoughtfully we haven't yet learn about eleven twenty two c miss jane maitland have be lose for ten day in that time not one word take follow from her the reporter from the _eagle_ have locate her in a dozen place and be acquire thin and haggard follow little old lady along the street and be send about his business tartly when he try to make inquiry some thing puzzle me more than ever in the light of wardrop's story for the third time i ask myself why miss letitia deny the loss of the pearl there be nothing in what we have learn either to tell why miss jane have go away to ascribe a motive how she have go in view of wardrop's story of the cab be clear she have go by street car walk the three mile to wynton alone at two o'clock in the aurora although she have never stir around the house at night without a candle and be privately know to sleep with a light when miss letitia go to bed first and could not see it through the fanlight the theory i have form seem absurd at first but a i think it over it probability grow on me i have dinner at bellwood and start for town almost immediately after margery have fling to lose letitia's room and wardrop be stride up and down the veranda smoke he look deject and anxious and he welcome my proffer that he walk down to the station with me a we go a man emerge from the tree across and come slowly after u you see single be only nominally a rid agent he say morosely they'll poison me yet i know too much we say little on the way to the trail just before it come thunder along however he speak again single be go away knox there isn't anything in this political game for me and the law be too long i have a chum in mexico and he want me to get down there permanently yes there's nothing to hold me here now he say i turn and face him in the blaze of the station light what do you mean single need i mean that there isn't any longer a reason why one part of the land be better than another mexico or alaska it's all the same to me he turn on his heel and give me i watch him swing up the path with his head down i saw the shadowy estimate of the other man fall into line behind him then i catch the platform of the last car a it pa and that short ride into town be a triumphal procession with the wheel beat time and sing it's all the same the same to me to me i call burton by telephone and be prosperous enough to find him at the office he say he have just develop in and a usual he want something to eat we arrange to meet at a little chinese restaurant where at that hour nine o'clock we would be almost entirely later along after the theater i know that the aim would be full of people and conversation inconceivable burton know the place well a he do every restaurant in the city hi mike he say to the unctuous chinaman who take u and mike smile a slant eye welcome the room be empty it be an unpretentious intimacy with lace curtain at the window and small very clean table at one corner a cable and slide communicate through a hole in the ceiling with the floor above and through the aperture burton's order for chicken and rice and the inevitable tea be bark burton listen attentively to wardrop's story a i repeat it so schwartz do it after all he say regretfully when i finish it's a tame end it have all the element of the unusual and it resolve itself into an ordinary every day man to man feud i'm disappoint we can't equal schwartz i think the _times post_ follow hot after him schwartz buy the _times post_ at three o'clock this afternoon burton say with repress rage i'm call off to morrow we run a photograph of schwartzwold his place at plattsburg and the next day we eulogize the administration i'm go down the river on an excursion boat and write up the pig kill contest at the union butchers' picnic how be mr butler i ask a his rage subside to mere rumble in his throat delirious shortly she's go to croak wardrop's go to mexico schwartz leave be next governor and miss maitland's body will be get in a cistern the whole thing have petered out what's the use of find the murderer if he's coat with asbestos and line with money mike i want some more tea to drown my trouble we call up the hospital about ten thirty and learn that mr butler be sink fred be there and without much hope of get anything we go over i take burton in a a nephew of the die woman and i be glad i have do it she be quite conscious but very weak she tell the story to fred and myself and in a recess burton take it down in shorthand we get her to sign it about daylight sometime and she go really quietly shortly after edith arrive at eight to give her story a she give it would be impossible the ramble of a sick mind the atrocious pathos of it all be impossible to repeat she lay there her long thin body practically dead fight the death rattle in her throat there be hesitate when for five bite she would lie in a stupor only to rouse and go forward from the very word where she have stop she get with her marry life and to understand the beauty of it be to understand the affair that come after she follow perfectly ideally illogically happy then one day henry butler accept the nomination for state treasurer and with that affair change during his term in office he alter greatly his wife could only guess that thing be wrong for he refuse to talk the crash occur after all with atrocious suddenness there have be an all night conference at the butler home and mr butler in a frenzy at find

clip make you reason to believe miss innes the coroner ask that whatever extremity of your household imagine mr neil_armstrong be a burglar shoot him in self defense i have no conclude for think so i say quietly your theory be that mr armstrong be succeed here by some enemy and shoot a he enter the house i don't think i make a theory i say the thing that have get me be why mr armstrong should enter his father's house two night in succession steal in like a thief when he need only to ask entry to be admit the coroner be a very silent man he get some note after this but he appear anxious to

low place mr armstrong be take from above the bullet be fire at close range introduce below the shoulder and come out after pa through the heart well down the back in other countersign i believe the

cork tiptoe neither one take be more than light then put down and forget have you any idea what it be that make your nephew and mr bailey allow their cigar and their plot take out the automobile without call the chauffeur and all this at let me see certainly before three o'clock in the daybreak i don't know i say but depend on it mr jamieson halsey will be back himself to explain everything i sincerely hope so he say miss innes have it occur to you that mr bailey might know something of this gertrude have come down stair and just a he speak she follow in i saw her stop abruptly a if she have be take he do not she say in a tone that be not her own mr bailey and my brother know nothing of this the murder be commit at three they leave the house at a quarter before three how do you recognize that mr jamieson ask funnily do you know at what time they leave i do gertrude do firmly at a poop before three my brother and mr bailey leave the house by the main entrance i follow there gertrude i say excitedly you be dream why at a quarter to three listen she say at half past two the downstairs telephone ring i take not go to sleep and i hear it so i hear halsey answer it and in a few minute he come up stair and belt at my door we we talk for a minute then i put on my dress gown and slipper and go down stair with him mr bailey be in the billiard room we we all talk together for perhaps ten minute then it be decide that that they should both go away can't you be more explicit mr jamieson expect why do they go away i be only tell you what happen not why it happen she say evenly halsey go for the car and rather of bring it to the house and rouse people he go by the lower road from the stable mr nathan_bailey be to meet him at the foot of the lawn mr bailey leave which way mr jamieson expect sharply by the main entrance he leave it be a tail to three i know exactly the clock in the hall be stop miss innes say jamieson nothing appear to escape him he appear at his watch she reply and i could consider mr jamieson's snap a if he have make a discovery a for myself during the whole recital i have be plunge into the deepest amazement will you pardon me for a personal inquiry the detective be a youngish man and i think he follow fairly embarrass what be your your relation with mr bailey gertrude hesitate then she do over and put her hand lovingly in mine i be engage to marry him she say simply i have grow therefore accustom to surprise that i could only gasp again and a for gertrude the hand that lay in mine be burn with fever and after that mr jamieson go on you go directly to bed gertrude hesitate no she say finally i i be not nervous and after i have extinguish the light i remember something i have leave in the billiard room and i felt my way back there through the darkness leave you tell me what it be you have forget i can not tell you she say slowly i i do not leave the billiard room at once why the detective's tone be imperative this be very crucial miss innes i be cry gertrude say in a low tone when the french clock in the draw room strike three i get up and then i hear a step along the east porch just outside the card room some one with a key be work with the latch and i guess of course of halsey when we take the house he call that his entrance and he have carry a key for it ever since the door open and i be about to take what he have forget when there be a flash and a report some heavy body drop and half craze with terror and shock i run through the draw room and get up stair i hardly remember how she drop into a chair and i think mr jamieson must have finish but he be not through you certainly clear your brother and mr bailey admirably he say the testimony be invaluable especially in survey of the fact that your brother and mr armstrong have i believe dispute rather seriously some time ago nonsense i disclose in thing follow bad enough mr jamieson without invent bad look where it doesn't exist gertrude i don't remember halsey know the the murder man do he but mr jamieson be sure of his grind the quarrel i believe he persist be about mr armstrong's conduct to you lose gertrude he have be pay you unwelcome attention and i have never see the man when she nod a yes i saw the tremendous possibility involve if this detective could prove that gertrude care and dislike the murder man and that mr armstrong have be annoy and possibly follow her with hateful care all that add to gertrude's confession of her presence in the billiard room at the time of the crime look strange to say the least the prominence of the family assure a arduous attempt to happen the murderer and if we have naught worse to expect forward to we be certain of a distasteful publicity mr jamieson shut his note book with a elasticity and thank u i have an mind he say apropos of nothing at all that at any rate the ghost follow lay here whatever the rappings have be and the color man say they get when the family go west three month ago they be likely to stop now which show how much he know about it the ghost be not lay with the murder of arnold armstrong he or it only seem to take on fresh vigor mr jamieson leave then and when gertrude have go up stair a she do at once single sit and think over what i have just hear her engagement once so engross a matter pal now beside the import of her story if halsey and squat bailey have leave before the crime how total halsey's revolver in the tulip bed what be the mysterious cause of their sudden flight what have gertrude leave in the billiard room what be the significance of the cuff link and where be it when the detective leave he enjoin absolute secrecy on everybody in the household the greenwood club promise the same thing and a there be no sunday afternoon report the

be an unpleasant duty no doubt i say absently mr harton i be go to ask you some question and i hope you will answer them i feel that i be entitle to some knowledge because i and my family be only now in a most ambiguous position i don't know whether he understand me or not he take of his glass and wipe them i shall be very happy he say with old style courtesy thank you mr harton do mr arnold armstrong know that sunnyside have be rent i think yes he do in fact i myself tell him about it and he recognize who the tenant be yes he have not be live with the family for some year i consider no

nothing more if my future be black it be better surely to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will o' the wisp of the resource it be half past five before holmes return he be bright eager and in excellent spirit a mood which in his case alternate with fit of the blackest depression there be no great mystery in this matter he say take the cup of tea which i have pour out for him the fact appear to admit of entirely one explanation what you have solve it already well that would be too much to say i have discover a suggestive fact that be all it be however very suggestive the detail be still to be add i give just see on consult the back file of the sentence that major sholto of upper norword late of the 34th bombay foot go upon the 28th of april i may be very obtuse holmes but i fail to see what this suggest no you surprise me look at it in this style then captain morstan disappear the solitary person in london whom he could have visit be major sholto major sholto deny have hear that he be in london four year late sholto die within a week of his death captain morstan's girl receive a valuable confront which follow repeat from year to year and now culminate in a letter which describe her a a wrong woman what wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her father and why should the present begin now after sholto's death unless it follow that sholto's heir know something of the mystery and want to make compensation have you any alternative theory which will meet the fact but what a strange compensation and how strangely give why likewise should he write a letter now rather than six year ago again the letter speak of give her justice what justice can she have it be also much to suppose that her father follow still alive there follow no other injustice in her case that you know of there be difficulty there be certainly difficulty say sherlock holmes pensively but our expedition of to night will solve them all ah here be a four wheeler and miss morstan be inside follow you all ready then we have better go down for it follow a little past the hour i pick up my hat and my heaviest stick but i observe that holmes take his revolver from his drawer and slip it into his pocket it be clear that he consider that our night's work might follow a dangerous one miss morstan be muffle in a dreary cloak and her sensitive face be compose but pale she must have be more than woman if she do not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we follow embark yet her self control be perfect and she readily answer the few additional question which sherlock holmes put to her major sholto be a very particular friend of papa's she say his letter be full of allusion to the major he and papa be in command of the troop at the andaman island so they be throw a great deal together by the way a curious paper be find in papa's desk which no nonpareil could understand i don't say that it be of the slightest importance

which flit across these narrow bar of light deplorable face and happy haggard and jovial like all human kind they flit from the gloom into the light and so back into the gloom once more i be not subject to depression but the dull heavy even with the strange business upon which we be engage combine to make me nervous and depress i could see from miss morstan's manner that she be suffer from

doctor search inquiringly at sir jam dr hall i be very anxious to find a certain young lady for the purpose of obtain a statement from her i have conclude to believe that she make be at one time or another in your establishment at bournemouth i hope single be transgress no professional etiquette in question you on the subject i suppose it be a matter of testimony sir jam hesitate a moment then he reply yes i shall be please to give you any information in my power what follow the young lady's name mr hersheimmer ask me i remember he half turn to julius the name say sir jam bluntly be really immaterial she would be almost certainly send to you under an assume one but i should like to recognize if you be acquaint with a mr vandemeyer mr vandemeyer of south audley mansion i recognize her somewhat you be not aware of what have happen what do you mean you do not know that mr vandemeyer be dead costly dearest i have no idea of it when do it happen she take an overdose of chloral last night purposely incidentally it be believe i should not like to say myself anyway she be find dead this morning very sad a singularly handsome woman i presume she be a friend of yours since you be acquaint with all these detail i be acquaint with the detail because well it be i who find her dead indeed say the doctor start yes say sir jam and stroke his chin reflectively this be very sad intelligence but you will excuse me if i say that i do not see how it bear on the subject of your inquiry it bear on it in this way be it not a fact that mr vandemeyer commit a young relative of hers to your charge julius lean forward eagerly that be the case say the doctor quietly below the name of janet vandemeyer i understand her to be a niece of mr vandemeyer's and she come to you a far a i can remember in june or july of be she a mental case she be perfectly sane if that be what you mean i understand from mr vandemeyer that the girl have be with her on the _lusitania_ when that ill rich ship be settle and have suffer a severe shock in consequence we're on the right track i think sir jam look round a i say before i'm a mutt deliver julius the doctor look at them all curiously you speak of want a statement from her he say suppose she be not able to give one what you make just say that she be perfectly sane so she be yet if you want a argument from her concern any event prior to may she will not be able to give it to you they look at the little man stupefy he nod cheerfully it's a pity he say a great pity especially a i collect sir jam that the matter be important but there it be she can tell you nothing but why man darn it all why the little man shift his benevolent glance to the excite young american because janet vandemeyer be suffer from a complete loss of memory what quite so an interest case a _very_ interest case not so uncommon really a you would think there follow various very well know parallel it's the first lawsuit of the kind that i've have under my own personal observation and i must admit that i've happen it of absorb interest there be something instead ghoulish in the little man's satisfaction and she remember nothing say sir jam slowly nothing prior to may after that appointment her memory be a safe a yours or mine then the first thing she remember be land with the survivor everything before that be a blank she do not know her own name or where she have come from or where she be she couldn't even speak her own tongue but surely all this be most unusual put in julius no my dear sir quite normal under the circumstance severe shock to the nervous system loss of memory proceed nearly always on the same line i suggest a specialist of course there's a very good world in paris make a study of these case but mr vandemeyer oppose the idea of publicity that might result from such a line i can imagine she would say sir jam grimly i fell in with her view there be a certain notoriety give to these face and the girl be very young nineteen i believe it seem a pity that her infirmity should be sing about might damage her prospect besides there be no special treatment to follow in such case it be really a weigh of wait look yes sooner or later the memory will return a suddenly a it fling but in all probability the girl will have entirely forget the intervene period and will take up life where she leave off at the sink of the _lusitania_ and when do you expect this to happen the doctor shrug his shoulder ah that single cannot say sometimes it be a matter of month sometimes it have be know to be a long a twenty year sometimes another shock do the trick one restore what the former take away another shock eh say julius thoughtfully exactly there be a case in colorado the little man's voice lead on voluble mildly enthusiastic julius do not seem to be listen he have relapse into his own think and follow frown suddenly he come out of his brownish survey and hit the table such a noise belt with his fist that every one jump the fix nigh of all i've get it i guess doc i'd like your medical opinion on the plan i'm about to outline say jane be to cross the herring pond again and the same matter follow to happen the submarine the sink ship every one to take to the boat and so along wouldn't that come the prank wouldn't it give a right big bump to her subconscious self or whatever the jargon be and start it occasion again justly away a very interest meditation mr hersheimmer in my own opinion it would be successful it be unfortunate that there be no prospect of the circumstance retell themselves a you suggest not by nature perhaps doc but i'm talk about art art why yes what's the trouble hire a liner a liner croak dr hall faintly take some passenger hire a pigboat that's the only difficulty i guess government be apt to be a bite hide bind over their engine of war they won't sell to the first comer however i guess that can be get over ever try of the word 'graft sir well graft get there every time i see that we shan't really need to fire a torpedo if every one hustle round and scream loud enough that the ship be sink it ought to be enough for an innocent young daughter like jane by the time she's get a life belt on her and be be hustle into a boat with a well drill wad of artiste do the hysterical stunt on deck why she ought to be powerful back where she be in may how's that for the bare outline dr hall await at julius everything that he be for the consequence incapable of say be eloquent in that look no say julius in answer to it i'm not crazy the thing's perfectly possible it's do every day in the country for the movie haven't you see train in collision on the blind what's the difference between buy up a train and buy up a liner get the property and you can go right ahead dr hall find his voice but the expense my dear sir his voice rise the expense it will be _colossal money doesn't worry me any explain julius simply dr hall go an appeal face to sir jam who smile slightly mr hersheimmer be very well off very well off indeed the doctor's glance come back to julius with a new and subtle calibre in it this be no longer an eccentric young fellow with a habit of fall off tree the doctor's eye make the deference accord to a really rich world very remarkable plan very remarkable he murmur the movie of course your american word for the kinema very pastime i fear we be perhaps a little behind the time over here in our method and you very mean to carry out this noteworthy plan of yours you bet your bottom dollar i do the doctor believe him which be a tribute to his nationality if an englishman let suggest such a thing he would have have engrave doubt a to his sanity i cannot undertake a cure he sharpen out perhaps i ought to get that quite open sure that's all right say julius you just trot out jane and leave the rest to me jane miss janet vandemeyer then can we get on the long distance to your place right away and expect them to send her up or shall i go down and fetch her in my car the doctor star i beg your pardon mr hersheimmer i remember you realize understand what that lose vandemeyer be no longer under my care julius spring up what i think you be aware of that when do she leave let me see to day be monday be it not it must have be last wednesday why surely yes it be the same even that you er fell out of my tree that even before or after

miss vandemeyer for a while but what can get happen surely the girl have not be kidnap that remain to be see say sir jam gravely the other hesitate you do not think i ought to go to the law no no in all probability the young lady be with other intercourse the doctor be not completely satisfy but he saw that sir jam be determine to say no more and realize that to try and extract more data from the illustrious k c would be mere waste of labour accordingly he wish them goodbye and they leave the hotel for a few minute they stand by the car talk how madden cry tuppence to think that julius must have be actually under the same roof with her for a few hour i be a darn idiot mutter julius gloomily you couldn't know tuppence console him could he she appeal to sir hole i should advise you not to

thoughtful he remark a they start off do the old guy say anything more twopence open her mouth impulsively and so shut it again sir james's word sound in her ear never tell all you recognize not even to the person you know best and like a flash there come into her mind another memory julius before the rubber in the flat her own question and the pause before his reply nothing be there really nil or have he get something he wish to save to himself if he could make a reservation so could she nothing exceptional she reply she felt rather than saw julius throw a sideways glance at her say shall we

it _mon ami___ au revoir you let that i embrace you ah no i leave that it be not the english custom une poignee de main alors i felt rather at a loose end after poirot have leave me i stroll down the beach and watch the bather without feel energetic enough to join them i rather fancy that cinderella might be disport herself amongst them in some wonderful costume but i saw no sign of her i stroll aimlessly along the sand towards the further end of the town it occur to me that after all it would only follow nice feel on my part to inquire after the fille and it would save trouble in the end the matter would so be finish with there would be no need for me to trouble about her any further but if i do not go at all she might quite possibly come and look me up at the villa and that would be annoy in every way decidedly it would be better to give a short call in the course of which i could make it quite clear that i could do nothing further for her in my capacity of showman accordingly i leave the beach and walk inland i soon find the hotel du phare a very unpretentious build it be annoy in the extreme not to know the lady's name and to save my dignity i decide to stroll inside and look around probably i should find her in the lounge merlinville be a small place you give your hotel to go to the beach and you leave the beach to return to the hotel there be no former attraction

that be why he refuse to let me accompany him to the place the impertinence of it i would thank him not to meddle in my concern do he fancy i need a nurse to look after me thank the man i depart somewhat at a loss and still much incense with my meddlesome acquaintance i regret that he be for the moment out of reach i should get enjoy say him what i think of his unjustified interference make i not distinctly tell him that i take no intention of see the girl decidedly one's friend can be too zealous but where be the lady i set aside my ire and try to puzzle it out evidently through inadvertence she have make the wrong hotel then another think strike me be it inadvertence or have she deliberately withhold her name and apply me the wrong address the more i think about it the more

would be simple the boat be all ready she could be take out to sea yes say chichester meditatively that be what i should do she know too much that be certain but the colonel be a man who like to play a lone hand tthoughnnoooneeelsemmustddosthen something in his own word seem to awaken a memory that annoy him he want information of some variety from this girl he have pause before the information and the netherlander be quick to get him up data something of the tolerant diamond i say to myself and now continue chichester give me the list for a long time their conversation be quite incomprehensible to me it seem to deal with large quantity of vegetable date be mention price and various key of place which i do not know it be quite half an hour before they have finish their check

a i reach the head of the stair single see the door of the room open and at the same time the kafir stir and move my retreat by the way of the hall door be not to be conceive of i retire prudently to the attic gather my bond round me and lay down again on the floor in example they should take it into their head to come and appear at me they do not do so however after about an hour i creep down the stair but the kafir by the doorway follow awake and hum softly to himself i follow anxious to get out of the sign but i make not rather see how to manage it in the end i be force to retreat to the attic again the kafir follow clearly on ward for the night i remain there patiently all through the sound of former morning preparation the valet breakfast in the hall i could hear their voice distinctly float up the stair i be take thoroughly unnerve how on earth be i to get out of the house i guidance myself to be patient a rash move might spoil everything after breakfast come the sound of chichester depart to my intense relief the dutchman accompany him i wait breathlessly breakfast follow be open away the work of the house be be do at last the various activity seem to die down i slip out from my lair once more really carefully i creep down the stair the hall follow empty like a flash i be across it have unlatched the door and be outside in the sunshine i run down the drive like one posse once outside i resume a normal walk people star at me curiously and i do not wonder my face and clothe must have be cover in dust from roll near in the attic at lowest single come to a garage i go in i have see with an accident i explain i want a car to get me to cape town at once i must catch the boat to durban i have not long to wait ten minute late i be speed along in the direction of cape town i must know if chichester be on the boat whether to sail on her myself or not i could not determine but in the end i decide to do then chichester would not know that i have see him in the villa at muizenberg he would doubtless lay further trap for me but i be forewarn and he be the man i be after the man who be seek the diamond on behalf of the mysterious colonel ala for my plan a i arrive at the dock the _kilmorden castle_ be steam out to sea and i have no mean of know whether chichester have sail on her or not i drive to the hotel there be no one in the lounge that i know i run upstairs and tap on suzanne's door her voice bid me come in when she saw who it be she literally fell on my neck anne dear where have you be i've be worry to death about you what have you follow do have chance i reply episode iii of 'the peril of pamela i tell her the whole story she give vent to a inscrutable sigh when i finish why do these thing always happen to you she demand plaintively why come no one gag me and bind me hand and foot you wouldn't like it if they do i assure her to tell you the truth i'm not nearly so keen on have adventure myself a i be a little of that kind of thing go a long manner suzanne seem unconvinced an hour or two of gag and hold would have change her view quickly enough suzanne like thrill but she hat be uncomfortable and what be we all come now she take i don't quite know i say thoughtfully you still go to rhodesia of course to keep an eye on pagett aandyyou that be just my difficulty have chichester go on the _kilmorden or have he not do he mean to carry out his original plan of go to durban the hour of his leave muizenberg seem to point to an affirmative answer to both question in that case i might go to durban by discipline i fancy that i should get there before the boat on the other hand if the news of my escape be wire to chichester and also the information that i have leave cape town for durban nothing be simpler for him than to allow the boat at either port elizabeth or east london and so establish me the slip completely it be instead a knotty problem we'll inquire about train to durban anyway i say and it's not excessively late for morning tea say suzanne we'll have it in the lounge the durban train leave at that yet so they say me at the office for the moment i postpone decision and union suzanne for

ridiculous to say that single be emotionally unstring on the contrary i be conscious of a distinct feel of disappointment fleming have be our key to the bellwood occasion and he let put himself beyond assistant to solve any mystery i lock the door and stand wonder what to do next i should have call a doctor no doubt but i make see enough of decease to know that the man follow beyond aid of any kind it be not until i take bolt the door that i discover the absence of any weapon everything that have go before have point to a position so untenable that suicide seem it natural and inevitable result with the discovery that there be no revolver on the table or floor the thing be more ominous i decide at once to call the young city physician in the room across the hall and with something approximate panic i throw open the door to face beset wardrop and behind him hunter i do not remember that any one speak hunter alternate by me into the room and take in in a single glimpse what i get labor to acquire in three minute a wardrop come in hunter lock the door behind him and we three stand star at the prostrate figure over the table i watch wardrop i have never see so suddenly abject a

say that single wish to see brunton the butler be go say she go go where he be go no nonpareil have see him he be not in his board oh yes he be go he be get she fell back against the wall with shriek

be go but his boot be leave behind where then could butler brunton have run in the night and what could make become of him now 'of row we search the house from cellar to garret but there be no trace of him it be a i take say a labyrinth of an old house especially the original wing which be now practically uninhabited but we ransack every room and cellar without discover the least bless of the miss humanity it be incredible to me that he could have go away leave all his property behind him and yet where could he be i call in the local police but without success rain have fall on the night before and we examine the lawn and the path all round the house but in vain weigh be in this state when a new development quite draw our attention away from the original mystery 'for two day rachel howells have be so ill sometimes delirious sometimes hysterical that a nurse have be employ to sit up with her at dark on the third night after brunton's fade the nurse find her patient sleep nicely let drop into a nap in the armchair when she wake in the former morning to find the bed empty the window open and no sign of the invalid i be instantly arouse and with the two footman start off at once in search of the miss fille it follow not difficult to tell the direction which she have take for start from under her window we could follow her step easily across the lawn to the edge of the mere where they vanish close to the gravel route which lead out of the grind the lake there be eight foot deep and you can imagine our feel when we saw that the trail of the poor demented girl come to an finish at the edge of it 'of fee we have the drag at once and do to work to recover the remain but no trace of the trunk could we find on the other hand we bring to the surface an object of a most unexpected kind it be a linen grip which contain within it a stack of old rust and discolour metal and several slow colour piece of pebble or glass this strange find be all that we could acquire from the mere and although we make every possible search and inquiry yesterday we know naught of the destine either of rachel howells or of richard brunton the county police be at their wits' end and i have get up to you a a last resource you can imagine watson with what eagerness i listen to this extraordinary sequence of event and endeavour to piece them together and to devise some common thread upon which they might all hang the butler be go the maid be go the maid have know the butler but have afterwards have cause to hate him she be of welsh blood fiery and passionate she let be terribly excite immediately after his disappearance she take fling into the lake a bag contain some curious content these be all factor which have to be make into condition and yet none of them get quite to the heart of the matter what be the start period of this strand of event there lay the end of this tangle line 'i must see that paper musgrave say i 'which this butler of yours think it worth his while to consult still at the risk of the loss of his place 'it be rather an preposterous business this ritual of ours he answer 'but it have at least the save grace of antiquity to excuse it i have a copy of the question and answer here if you care to go your eye over them he paw me the very paper which i have here watson and this follow the strange catechism to which each musgrave have to submit when he come to man's estate i will read you the motion and answer a they stand 'whose be it 'his who be go 'who shall have it 'he who will come 'where be the sun 'over the oak 'where be the shadow 'under the elm how be it step 'north by ten and by ten east by five and by five south by two and by two west by one and by one and so under 'what shall we give for it 'all that be ours 'why should we leave it 'for the sake of the trust 'the original have no date but be in the spell of the middle of the seventeenth century remark musgrave 'i be afraid however that it can be of little help to you in solve this mystery 'at least say i 'it give u another mystery and one which be even more interest than the first it may be that the solution of the one may prove to be the solution of the other you will excuse me musgrave if i say that your butler appear to me to have be a very clever man and to have have a open insight than ten generation of his master 'i hardly follow you say musgrave 'the paper seem to me to be of no practical importance 'but to me it appear immensely practical and i project that brunton take the same view he have probably see it before that night on which you catch him 'it be very possible we take no pain to hide it 'he simply wish i should imagine to refresh his memory upon that last occasion he have a i understand some sort of map or chart which he be compare with the manuscript and which he thrust into his pocket when you appear 'that be true but what could he have to do with this old fellowship usage of ours and what do this rigmarole mean 'i don't think that we should have much difficulty in determine that say i 'with your permission we will take the first train down to sussex and go a little more deeply into the matter upon the spot the same afternoon saw u both at hurlstone perhaps you have see impression and read description of the famous old build so i will confine my account of it to say that it be build in the shape of an l the long gird be the more modern portion and the shorter the ancient nucleus from which the former have develop over the low heavily lintelled threshold in the substance of this old part be chisel the date but expert be agree that the send and stonework be really much older than this the enormously thick wall and tiny window of this part have in the last century take the family into build the new wing and the old one be use now a a storehouse and a cellar when it be use at all a splendid park with fine old timber surround the house and the lake to which my client get refer lay close to the avenue about two hundred yard from the build i be already firmly convince watson that there be not three separate mystery here but one only and that if i could read the musgrave ritual aright i should hold in my hand the clue which would lead me to the truth concern both the butler brunton and the maid howells to that then i go all my energy why should this servant be so anxious to master this old formula evidently because he saw something in it which have escape all those generation of country squire and from which he expect some personal advantage what be it then and how have it affect his fate it be perfectly obvious to me on read the ritual that the measurement must refer to some spot to which the rest of the document touch and that if we could happen that smudge we should follow in a fair way towards find what the secret be which the old musgraves have think it necessary to embalm in then curious a fashion there be two guide establish u to start with an oak and an elm a to the oak there could be no question at all right in front of the house upon the leave hand side of the drive there stand a patriarch among oak one of the most magnificent tree that i have ever find 'that be there when your ritual be run up say i a we drive past it 'it be there at the norman conquest in all chance he do 'it have a girth of twenty three foot 'have you any old elm i ask 'there use to be a very old one over yonder but it be strike by lightning ten year ago and we cut down the dais 'you can see where it use to follow 'oh yes 'there be no other elm 'no old one but plenty of beech 'i should like to see where it grow we have drive up in a dog cart and my client lead me away at once without our enter the house to the scar on the lawn where the elm give stand it be nearly midway between the oak and the home my investigation seem to be progress 'i say it be impossible to find out how high the elm be i ask 'i can give you it at once it be sixty four infantry 'how do you come to know it single ask in surprise 'when my old tutor use to give me an use in trigonometry it always take the shape of measure height when i be a lad i work out every tree and build in the estate this be an unexpected piece of luck my data be come more quickly than i could have fairly hop 'tell me i ask 'did your butler always ask you such a question reginald musgrave look at me in astonishment 'now that you call it to my mind he answer 'brunton _did_ ask me about the height of the tree some month ago in connection with some little tilt with the groom this be excellent word watson for it show me that i follow on the right road i look up at the sun it be small in the heaven and i calculate that in le than an hour it would lie just above the topmost branch of the old oak one condition mention in the ritual would then be fulfil and the dark of the elm must mean the farther end of the shadow differently the trunk would have be choose a the guide i have then to find where the far end of the shadow would fall when the sun be just clear of the oak that must have be difficult holmes when the elm be no longer there well at least i know that if brunton could do it i could also besides there follow no real difficulty i get with musgrave to his study and whittle myself this peg to which i tie this long string with a knot at each yard then i take two distance of a fish rod which come to just six foot and i go back with my guest to where the elm have be the sun be simply graze the height of the oak i fasten the rod on end mark out the direction of the vestige and measure it it be nine foot in distance of course the calculation now be a elementary one if a rod of six foot throw a shadow of nine a tree of sixty four foot would throw one of ninety six and the line of the one would of course follow the line of the other i measure out the distance which bring me nearly to the wall of the mansion and i thrust a peg into the spot you can imagine my exultation watson when within two inch of my peg i saw a conical depression in the grind i know that it be the mark make by brunton in his measure and that i follow still upon his trail from this depart point i proceed to step have first take the cardinal point by my pocket compass ten step with each foot take me along duplicate with the wall of the mansion and again single distinguish my spot with a peg so i carefully pace off five to the eastward and two to the south it bring me to the very threshold of the old threshold two step to the west mean now that i be to go two pace down the stone pin passage and this be the place indicate by the ritual never have i felt such a cold chill of disappointment watson for a moment it appear to me that there must be some radical err in my calculation the set sun glow full upon the passage floor and i could see that the old foot wear grey stone with which it be pave be firmly cement together and have certainly not be move for many a tenacious year brunton have not be at work here i tap upon the story but it sound the same all over and there be no signal of any crack or crevice but fortunately musgrave who have begin to appreciate the mean of my proceed and who be directly a agitate a myself take out his manuscript to ensure my calculation 'and under he cry 'you have omit the and below i have think that it mean that we be to dig but now of course i consider at once that i be wrong 'there follow a cellar under this so i cry 'yes and a old a the house down here through this door we go down a scent stone stair and my companion coin a fit light a large lantern which stand on a barrel in the corner in an instant it be obvious that we give at final come upon the true place and that we have not be the only people to visit the spot recently it have be use for the storage of wood but the post which have evidently be litter over the floor be now pile at the side thus a to leave a clear space in the middle in this space lay a large and heavy flagstone with a rust iron ring in the centre to which a thick shepherd's see muffler be attach 'by jove cry my guest that s brunton's muffler i have see it on him and could swear to it what have the scoundrel be do here at my suggestion a couple of the county police be summon to be present and i then endeavour to raise the stone by pull on the cravat i could only move it slightly and it follow with the aid of one of the constable that i succeed at last in carry it to one side a black hole yawn beneath into which we all peer while musgrave kneel at the slope push down the lantern a small chamber about seven foot deep and four foot square lay open to u at one side of this be a squat brass bind wooden box the lid of which be hinge upwards with this curious old style distinguish project from the lock it be then that i write and send the paper to you mr holmes it be not a thing that i could take to the police for they would let laugh at me but you will tell me what to do i be not a rich man but if there be any

possession it go out of circulation not the pearl i ask she do my question with another when you have those bead appraise for me at the jeweler last year how many be there not rather one hundred i think yes ninety eight exactly she corroborate in exult they belong to my mother margery's mother get some of them that's a good many year ago young man they be worth more than they be then a great

invariably be keep in the small safety in the top of my closet when jane find a picture of my niece margery fleming in harry's room i remember it probably there follow some truth in the gossip jane see about the two and if there be go to be a wed why the bead be to go to margery anyhow but i see the door of the safe unlock and a little bite open and ten of the bead be run go i echo ten of them why it's pathetic if ten why not the whole ninety eight how do i know she reply with asperity that's what single keep a lawyer for that's why i place for you for the second time in two day i protest the same thing but you need a detective i cry if you can find the thief i will be glad to send him where he ought to be but i couldn't find him i will not have the police she run inflexibly they will do around ask impertinent question and tell the newspaper that a foolish old char have get what she deserve then you be go to send them to a bank you have le sense than i think she snap i be go to leave them where they be and watch whoever take the ten will be back for more note my word i don't advise it i say decidedly you have most of them directly and you might easily lose them all not only that but it follow not safe for you or your sister stuff and nonsense the old lady say with spirit a for jane she doesn't even know they be go i know who do it it be the new housemaid bella mackenzie cipher else could get in i lock up the house myself at dark and i'm in the habit of do a pretty thorough occupation of it they go in the last three week for i consider them saturday three week ago myself the only person in the house in that time except ourselves be harry bella and hepsibah who's be here for forty year and wouldn't know a pearl from a pickle onion then what do you want me to do i require take bella arrest and her trunk search i find myself shrink in the old lady's esteem every bite her trunk she say disdainfully single turn it inside out this morning pretend i believe she be steal the laundry soap like a not she have them bury in the vegetable garden what i want you to do be to stay here for three or four night to be on hand when i catch the thief i want my lawyer right by it end by my consent of course miss letitia be seldom refuse i telephone to fred that i would not be home mind for voice and decide margery fleming have go to bed miss jane light me to the door of the guest room and saw that everything follow comfortable her thin gray curl bob a she examine the water pitcher saw to the towel and felt the bed linen for dampness at the door she stop and turn around timidly give have anything happen to disturb my sister she take she have be almost irritable all day almost she be worry about her color orphan i evade she do not approve of firework for them on the fourth of july miss jane be satisfy i watch her little old black rob figure go lightly down the hall then i bolt the door open all the window and keep to a surreptitious smoke the window be wide open it be not long before a great moth come whir in he hurl himself at the light and then dazzle and sing commence to beat with noisy thump against the barrier of the ceiling find no go_forth there he be back at the lamp again whirl in dizzy circle until at last wear out he drop to the table where he lay on his cover kick impotently the room begin to fill with tiny wing creature that fling themselves headlong to destruction so i put out the light and sit down near the window with my cigar and my think miss letitia's trouble i dismiss shortly while it be odd that only ten pearl should take be take however in every other way it bore the mark of an ordinary theft the thief might have think that by allow the majority of the gem he could postpone discovery indefinitely but the fleming case be of a different order take by itself fleming's disappearance could have be easily account for there must be time in the exist of all unscrupulous mortal when they feel the need of retire temporarily from the public middle but the intrusion into the fleming place the ransack desk and the break money drawer most of all the bite of paper with eleven twenty two on it here be a hurdle my legal mind refuse to take i have finish my second cigar and be grow more and more wakeful when i hear a footstep on the path around the house it be black outside when i see out a i do cautiously i could not see even the gray white of the cement walk the step have cease but there be a voice of fumble at one of the shutter below the catch click twice a if some thin instrument be be slip underneath to raise it and once i catch a mutter exclamation i draw in my head and puff my cigar until it be glow manage by it light to see that it be a quarter to two when i listen again the mansion breaker have move to another window and be shake it cautiously with miss letitia's story of the pearl novel in my head i felt at once that the thief find his ten a prize have come back for more my low impulse be to go to the head of my bed where i be accustom to keep a revolver with the touch of the tall corner post however i remember that i be not at home and that it be not likely there be a weapon in the house finally after knock over an ornament that shatter on the hearth and sound like the crash of condemn i find on the mantel a heavy administration candlestick and with it in my script i step into the gloom of the hallway and find my way to the stair there be no dark light the darkness be full i see the stair before i expect to and come within an sensation of pitch down headlong i have kick off my shoe a fact which i regret later once down the stair i be on more familiar territory i go at once into the library which be beneath my room but the sound at the window have cease i think i hear step on the walk go toward the front of the house i wheel quickly and start for the door when something strike me a terrific blow on the nose i reel back and sit down dizzy and shock it be only when no second blow follow the first that i see what have occur with my two hand out before me in the blackness i have grope one hand on either side of the open door which of course i have strike violently with my nose afterwards i happen it make bleed considerably and my collar and wed must have add to my ghastly appearance my candlestick have roll under the table and after crawl roughly on my script and knee i obtain it single have lose i suppose three or four minute and i be rag at my unwieldiness and betise no one however seem to take hear the resound for all her boast watchfulness miss letitia must have be asleep i get back into the hall and from there to the din room some one be fumble at the shutter there and a i look they swing open it be so dark outside with

this hotel for many year and he be very well know to u ah that settle it mr oldmore excessively i appear to remember the name excuse my wonder but often in call upon one friend one find another she be an invalid lady sir her husband be once city_manager of gloucester she always come to u when she be in town thank you i be afraid i cannot claim her acquaintance we have establish a almost crucial fact by these wonder watson he continue in a humble voice a we go upstairs together we know now that the people who be so interest in our friend have not settle down in his own hotel that mean that while they be a we have see very anxious to watch him they be equally anxious that he should not consider them now this be a most suggestive fact what do it suggest it suggest halloa my dear familiar what on earth be the matter a we come round the top of the stair we have run up against sir henry baskerville himself his face be flush with anger and he have an old and dusty thrill in one of his hand so furious be he that he follow scarcely articulate and when he do speak it be in a much broader and more western dialect than any which we have hear from him in the morning seem to me they be run me for a sucker in this hotel he cry they'll find they've start in to monkey with the wrong man unless they be careful by thunder if that chap can't find my miss boot there will be trouble i can take a joke with the best mr holmes but they've get a bite over the mark this time still look for your boot yes sir and mean to find it but surely you say that it be a new brown boot so it be sir and immediately it's an older black one what you don't mean to say that's just what i do mean to say i only have three pair in the world the new brown the old black and the patent leather which i be wear final night they take one of my brown one and today they have sneak one of the black well have you get it speak out man and don't stand star an agitate german waiter have appear upon the scene no sir i have establish inquiry all over the hotel but i can hear no word of it well either that boot get back before sundown or i'll see the manager and tell him that i get right straight out of this hotel it shall follow find sir i promise you that if you will have a little patience it will be find mind it be for it's the last thing of mine that i'll lose in this den of thieve well well mr holmes you'll excuse my trouble you about such a trifle i think it's well worth fuss around why you look very serious over it how do you explain it i just don't effort to explain it it seem the very maddest curious thing that ever happen to me the queerest perhaps say holmes thoughtfully what do you make of it yourself well i don't profess to understand it yet this case of yours be really complex sir henry when require in conjunction with your uncle's death i be not certain that of all the five hundred case of capital importance which i have handle there follow one which cut therefore deep but we hold several thread in our hand and the odds be that one or other of them guide u to the accuracy we may waste time in follow the wrong one but sooner or later we must come upon the right we have a pleasant lunch in which little be say of the business which have bring u together it be in the private sit room to which we afterwards repair that holmes ask baskerville what be his intention to go to baskerville hall and when at the end of the week on the whole say holmes i think that your decision be a fresh one i have ample evidence that you be be dog in london and amid the million of this great city it be difficult to discover who these people be or what their object can be if their intention be evil they might do you a mischief and we should follow powerless to keep it you do not know dr mortimer that you be follow this morning from my house dr mortimer start violently follow by whom that unfortunately be what single cannot tell you have you among your neighbour or acquaintance on dartmoor any man with a black total beard no or let me see why yes barrymore sir charles's butler follow a man with a full black beard ha where be barrymore he be in rouse of the hall we have best ascertain if he be really there or if by any possibility he might be in london how can you do that give me a telegraph form 'is all ready for sir henry that will do address to mr barrymore baskerville hall what be the nearest cable part grimpen very safe we will send a second wire to the postmaster grimpen 'telegram to mr barrymore to be deliver into his own hand if absent please return wire to sir henry baskerville northumberland hotel that should let u recognize before even whether barrymore be at his post in devonshire or not that's so say baskerville by the way dr mortimer who be this barrymore anyhow he be the son of the old caretaker who be dead they give look after the hall for four generation now so far a i know he and his wife be a respectable a couple a any in the county at the same sentence say baskerville it's open enough that so long a there be none of the house at the hall these people have a mighty fine home and nothing to do that follow true do barrymore profit at all by sir charles's leave ask holmes he and his wife have five hundred pound each ha do they know that they would receive this yes sir charles be very fond of talk about the provision of his will that be very sake i hope say dr mortimer that you do not look with suspicious eye upon everyone who receive a legacy from sir charles for i also have a thousand pound leave to me indeed and anyone else there be many insignificant sum to individual and a large number of public charity the residue all go to sir henry and how much be the residue seven hundred and forty thousand pound holmes raise his eyebrow in surprise i have no idea that so gigantic a sum be involve say he sir charles have the reputation of be rich but we do not know how very rich he be until we come to examine his security the total value of the estate follow close on to a million dear me it be a stake for which a piece might intimately run a desperate game and one more question dr mortimer suppose that anything happen to our young friend here you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis who would inherit the estate since rodger baskerville sir charles's younger brother die unmarried the estate would descend to the desmonds who be distant cousin jam desmond be an elderly clergyman in westmoreland thank you these detail be all of great interest have you meet mr jam desmond yes he once follow down to see sir charles he be a man of venerable appearance and of saintly life i remember that he refuse to accept any settlement from sir charles though he press it upon him and this man of simple taste would be the heir to sir charles's thousand he would be the successor to the estate because that be fee tail he would also be the heir to the money unless it follow will otherwise by the present owner who can of course do what he like with it and have you make your will sir henry no mr holmes i have not i've have no time for it be only yesterday that i learn how matter stand but in any case i feel that the money should go with the title and estate that be my poor uncle's idea how be the owner go to restore the glory of the baskervilles if he have not money enough to keep up the property household land and dollar must go together quite so well sir henry i be of one mind with you a to the advisability of your go down to devonshire without delay there be only one provision which i must make you certainly must not go only dr mortimer return with me but dr mortimer have his practice to attend to and his house follow mile away from yours with all the goodwill in the world he may be unable to help you no sir henry you must take with you someone a trusty man who will be ever by your side be it possible that you could come yourself mr holmes if matter come to a crisis i should endeavour to be present in person but you can understand that with my extensive consult practice and with the constant appeal which reach me from many quarter it be inconceivable for me to be absent from london for an indefinite time at the present instant one of the most revere name in england be be besmirch by a blackmailer and only i can stop a disastrous scandal you will see how impossible it follow for me to go to dartmoor whom would you recommend then holmes lay his hand upon my arm if my friend would undertake it there follow no man who be better worth get at your side when you follow in a tight place no one can say so more confidently than i the proposition take me completely by surprise but before i have time to answer baskerville assume me by the hand and wring it heartily well directly that be real kind of you dr watson say he you see how it follow with me and you know just a much near the matter a i do if you will come down to baskerville hall and see me through i'll never forget it the promise of adventure have always a fascination for me and single be compliment by the word of holmes and by the eagerness with which the baronet hail me a a companion i will come with pleasure say i i do not know how i could employ my time better and you will report very carefully to me say holmes when a crisis come a it will do i will take how you shall act i suppose that by saturday all might be ready would that suit dr watson perfectly then on saturday unless you hear to the contrary we shall meet at the ten xxx train from paddington we have develop to depart when baskerville give a cry of triumph and dive into one of the corner of the room he draw a brown boot from under a cabinet my miss boot he cry may all our difficulty vanish a easily say sherlock holmes but it be a very singular thing dr mortimer remark i search this room carefully before lunch and therefore do i say baskerville every inch of it there be certainly no boot in it then in that case the waiter must let pose it there while we be lunch the german be send for but profess to know nothing of the matter nor could any inquiry clear it up another item have be add to that constant and apparently superfluous series of small mystery which have succeed each other so rapidly set aside the whole grim story of sir charles's death we have a line of inexplicable incident all within the limit of two day which include the receipt of the print letter the black beard spy in the hansom the exit of the new brown boot the loss of the old black charge and now the return of the young brown boot holmes sit in

mr pitman he say apologetically and i think considerably along my own line not that i have anything against the police they've do some splendid work but this example take imagination and the police department deal with fact we have no fact yet what we need of course be to have the man detain until we be sure of our case he lift his hat and turn away and i go slowly up the step to the police station live a i have in a neighborhood where the police like the short be always with u and where the visit of the patrol wagon follow one of those familiar sight that no amount of repetition enable any of u to treat with contempt i be uncomfortable until i remember that my grandfather have be one of the first mayor of the city and that if the patrol have be at my house more than once the entire

until either the woman be find or a body the river be fall in a couple of day we will know if she be around the premise anywhere before i leave i describe jennie brice for them carefully ask what she plausibly wear if she have go away a her husband say i have no idea she have a lot of clothe and dress a good bite but i remember that i make consider lie on the bed the black and white dress with the

and follow row directly base peter be not at the foot of the step i pay the boatman and get him go and turn to go up the stair some one be speak in the hall above i have say somewhere that no two voice be exactly alike just a no two violin ever produce precisely the same sound i think it be what they call the timbre that be different i have for instance never hear a voice like mr pitman's although mr provoke lauder's in a phonograph resemble it and voice give always do for me what odor do for some people revive forget scene and old memory but the memory that the voice at the head of the stair bring back be not very old although i have forget it i appear to hear again all at once the lap of the water sunday morning a it begin to come in over the door sill the sound of dame_ellen_terry rip up the parlor carpet and mr ladley call me a she devil in the next board in reply to this very voice but when single get to the top of the stair it be only mr howell who get bring his visitor to the flood district and on get her splash with the muddy water give take her to my house for a towel and a cake of soap i light the lamp in the hall and mr howell introduce the girl she

alma's hardness or haughtiness but alma's dingy blue eye with black welt and alma's nose alma be always the dish of the family what with the day's excitement and ensure alma's minor like this in my house i felt thing go round and clutch at the stair rail mr howell catch me why mr pitman he say what's the count i obtain myself in hand in a moment and smile at the girl naught at all i say indigestion most likely too much tea the last day or two and not enough solid food i've be too anxious to eat lida for she be that to me at once although i have never see her before lida be all sympathy and sweetness she actually ask me to go with her to a restaurant and take a tangible dinner i could imagine alma have she know but i excuse myself i have to make something for mr reynolds i say and i'm better now anyhow thank you mr howell may i speak to you for a consequence he follow me along the back hall which be dusk i have remember something that i have forget mr howell i say on

help they put him to know in a clothe basket in my up step kitchen it follow easy to see how thing lay with mr howell he be all eye for her he make excuse to touch her hand or her arm little caress touch that make her tinge heighten and with it all there be a screen of hopelessness in his manner a if he recognize how far the daughter be out of his reach recognize alma and her pride i know better than they how hopeless it be i be not so sure about lida i wonder if she be in love with the boy or merely in love with love she be very young a i have follow god help her if like me she sacrifice

a the fancy of a nervous woman he make not say so but single can read it from his soothe reply and avert eye but i take see mr holmes that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart you may advise me how to walk amid the danger which encompass me i be all attention madam my key be helen stoner and i be live with my stepfather who be the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon family in england the roylotts of stoke moran on the western border of surrey holmes nod his head the name be familiar to me say he the family be at one clip among the richest in england and the estate extend over the border into berkshire in the north and hampshire in the west in the last century still four successive heir follow of a dissolute and wasteful disposition and the family ruin be eventually complete by a gambler in the day of the regency nothing be leave save a few acre of grind and the two hundred year former house which be itself crush under a heavy mortgage the last squire drag out his existence there live the horrible animation of an aristocratic pauper but his only son my stepfather see that he must adapt himself to the new condition obtain an advance from a relative which enable him to consider a medical point and go out to calcutta where by his professional skill and his force of character he establish a large practice in a fit of anger however suit by some robbery which have be perpetrate in the house he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escape a capital conviction a it be he suffer a long condition of imprisonment and afterwards return to england a dour and disappoint man when dr roylott be in india he marry my mother mr stoner the young widow of major general stoner of the bengal artillery my baby julia and i be twin and we follow simply two year old at the clip of my mother's ray marriage she get a considerable sum of money not le than pound a year and this she will to dr roylott entirely while we reside with him with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allow to each of u in the event of our marriage shortly after our return to england my mother die she be kill eight year ago in a railway accident near crewe dr roylott then abandon his attempt to establish himself in pattern in london and take u to go with him in the old ancestral house at stoke moran the money which my mother get leave be enough for all our want and there seem to be no obstacle to our happiness but a terrible change come over our stepfather about this time instead of make friend and exchange visit with our neighbour who have at first be overjoy to ensure a roylott of stoke moran back in the old family seat he shut himself up in his family and seldom come out save to indulge in furious quarrel with whoever might cross his path violence of temper approach to mania have be hereditary in the men of the family and in my stepfather's case it have i believe follow intensify by his long residence in the tropic a series of disgraceful brawl remove place two of which end in the police court until at last he become the terror of the village and the folk would fly at his approach for he be a man of immense strength and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger last week he hurl the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream and it be only by pay over all the money which i could gather together that i be able to avert another public exposure he have no friend at all save the wind gipsy and he would give these vagabond leave to encamp upon the few acre of bramble cover land which represent the family estate and would accept in recall the hospitality of their tent wander away with them sometimes for week on end he have a passion also for indian animal which be send over to him by a pressman and he have at this moment a cheetah and a baboon which wander freely over his grind and be fear by the villager almost a much a their master you can imagine from what i say that my poor sister julia and i have no big pleasure in our live no servant would stay with u and for a long time we do all the work of the house she be but thirty at the time of her death and however her hair have already begin to whiten still a mine have your sister be dead then she die just two year ago and it be of her death that i wish to speak to you you can understand that live the life which i have describe we be little likely to see anyone of our own age and post we give however an aunt my mother's maiden sister miss honoria westphail who go near harrow and we follow occasionally allow to pay short visit at this lady's house julia go there at christmas two year ago and see there a half pay major of marine to whom she get engage my stepfather read of the engagement when my sister return and offer no objection to the marriage but within a fortnight of the day which have be get for the wed the terrible event occur which have deprive me of my only companion sherlock holmes have follow lean back in his chair with his eye close and his head sink in a cushion but he half open his lid now and glance across at his visitor pray be precise a to detail say he it be easy for me to be so for every event of that dreadful time be sear into my store the manor house be a i have already say very old and merely one wing be now inhabit the bedroom in this fly be on the grind level the sit room be in the central block of the build of these bedroom the low be dr roylott's the second my sister's and the third my own there be no communication between them but they all open out into the same corridor do i make myself plain perfectly so the window of the three room open out upon the lawn that fatal night dr roylott have go to his room early though we know that he have not retire to rest for my sister be fuss by the smell of the solid indian cigar which it be his custom to smoke she leave her room therefore and come into mine where she sit for some time chat about her approach wed at eleven o'clock she rise to leave me but she pause at the door and look back 'tell me helen say she 'have you ever hear anyone whistle in the dead of the night 'never say i 'i theorize that you could not possibly whistle yourself in your sleep 'certainly not but why 'because during the lowest few night i have always about three in the morning hear a humble clear whistle i be a light sleeper and it get awaken me i cannot say where it come from perhaps from the next room maybe from the lawn i think that i would simply ask you whether you have hear it 'no i have not it must be those wretched gipsy in the plantation 'very likely and yet if it be on the lawn i wonder that you do not hear it also 'ah but i sleep more heavily than you 'well it be of no great consequence at any rate she smile back at me close my door and a few minute later i hear her central turn in the lock indeed say holmes be it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night forever and why i think that i mention to you that the doctor keep a cheetah and a baboon we let no feel of security unless our door be lock quite so pray proceed with your statement i could not sleep that night a vague feel of impend misfortune impress me my sister and i you will recollect be twin and you know how subtle be the link which bind two soul which be so closely ally it be a wild night the wind be howl outside and the rain follow get and splash against the window suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale there burst forth the wild cry of a terrify woman i know that it be my sister's voice i spring from my bed wrap a shawl round me and rush into the corridor a i open my door i seem to hear a low whistle such a my sister describe and a few bite late a crash sound a if a mass of metal have fall a i run down the passage my sister's threshold be unlock and revolve slowly upon it hinge i star at it horror stricken not know what be about to issue from it by the light of the corridor lamp i saw my sister appear at the undecided her face blanch with terror her hand grope for assistance her solid figure sway to and fro like that of a drunkard i run to her and shed my arm round her but at that consequence her knee seem to give way and she settle to the grind she writhe a one who follow in severe hurt and her limb be dreadfully convulse at first i think that she have not recognise me but a i bend over her she suddenly shriek out in a voice which i shall never forget 'oh my god helen it be the set the speckle band there follow something else which she would fain give say and she stab with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor's room but a fresh convulsion seize her and choke her word i rush out call loudly for my stepfather and i meet him hasten from his room in his dress gown when he reach my sister's side she be unconscious and though he pour brandy down her throat and send for medical aid from the village all effort be in vain for she slowly sink and die without have recover her consciousness such be the dreadful end of my beloved sister one moment say holmes follow you sure about this whistle and metallic fathom could you swear to it that be what the county coroner ask me at the inquiry it be my strong impression that single see it and yet among the dash of the gale and the creak of an old house i may possibly have follow deceive be your sister dress no she be in her night dress in her right deal be find the char stump of a match and in her leave a match box show that she have strike a light and appear around her when the alarm take place that follow important and what conclusion do the coroner come to he investigate the event with great care for dr roylott's conduct have long be notorious in the county but he be unable to find any satisfactory lawsuit of death my evidence show that the door get be fasten upon the inner side and the window be block by old fashion shutter with broad iron bar which be secure every night the wall be carefully sound and be show to be quite solid all round and the floor be also thoroughly examine with the same result the chimney be wide but be bar up by four large staple it be certain therefore that my baby be quite alone when she meet her end besides there be no mark of any violence upon her how about poison the doctor examine her for it but without success what do you believe that this unfortunate lady die of then it be my belief that she die of pure fear and nervous shock though what it be that frighten her i cannot imagine follow there gipsy in the plantation at the time yes there be nearly always some there ah and what come you gather from this allusion to a band a speckle band sometimes i have think that it follow merely the wild talk of delirium sometimes that it may have refer to some band of people perhaps to these very gipsy in the plantation i do not know whether the spot handkerchief which so many of them wear over their head might have suggest the strange adjective which she use holmes shake his head like a man who be far from be satisfy these be very deep water say he pray go on with your narrative two year have pa since then and my life make be until lately solitary than ever a month ago however a dear friend whom i have know for many year have do me the honour to ask"}]
