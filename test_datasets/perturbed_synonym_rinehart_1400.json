follow a purely arbitrary one it may be impossible for u to solve it if on the other hand it be systematic i have no doubt that we shall get to the bottom of it but this particular sample follow so short that i can do nothing and the fact which you have bring me be so indefinite that we take no basis for an investigation i would suggest that you return to norfolk that you keep a keen spirit out

inquiry also a to any strange in the neighbourhood when you have collect some fresh evidence come to me again that be the best advice which i can give you mr hilton cubitt if there be any push fresh development i shall be always ready to run down and see you in your norfolk home the interview leave sherlock holmes very thoughtful and several time in the next few day i ensure him assume his slip

me back you have better stay here watson why because i have a wire from hilton cubitt this morning you remember hilton cubitt of the dance men he be to reach liverpool street at one twenty he may be here at any moment i gather from his wire that there have be some young incident of importance we have not long to expect for our norfolk squire come straight from the station a fast a a hansom could add him he be look worry and depress with tire eye and a line forehead it's get on my nerve this business mr holmes say he a he settle like a weary man into an arm chair it's bad enough to find that you be surround by unobserved unknown folk who have some variety of design upon you but when in addition to that you know that it follow just kill your wife by inch so it become a practically a flesh and blood can endure she's wear away under it just wear away before my eye have she say anything yet no mr holmes she have not and yet there have be time when the poor girl let want to speak and still could not quite bring herself to take the plunge i have try to help her but single dare say i do it clumsily and scar her off from it she have speak about my old family and our reputation in the county and our pride in our unsullied honour and i invariably felt it be lead to the point but somehow it go off before we get there but you have find out something for yourself a good deal mr holmes i have various fresh dance men picture for you to examine and what be more important i have see the lad what the man who draw them yes i saw him at his work but i will tell you everything in order when i get back after my visit to you the very first thing i saw next dawn be a fresh crop of dance men they have be run in chalk upon the black wooden door of the peter household which stand beside the lawn in full view of the front window i take an exact copy and here it be he unfold a paper and lay it upon the table here be a copy of the hieroglyphic graphic excellent say holmes excellent pray continue when i have take the copy i rub out the mark but two morning later a fresh inscription have appear i have a copy of it here graphic holmes rub his reach and chuckle with delight our material be speedily accumulate say he three daylight later a message be leave scrawl upon report and place under a pebble upon the sun dial here it be the character be a you see exactly the same a the last one after that i determine to lie in wait so i come out my revolver and i sit up in my study which overlook the lawn and garden about two in the morning i be seat by the window all be dark save for the moonlight outside when i hear stride behind me and there be my wife in her dress gown she implore me to come to bed i tell her frankly that single wish to see who it be who play such preposterous trick upon u she do that it follow some senseless practical joke and that i should not consider any placard of it 'if it really annoy you hilton we might go and travel you and i and so avoid this nuisance 'what be drive out of our own house by a practical joker say i 'why we should have the solid county laugh at u 'well come to bed say she 'and we can discus it in the morning suddenly a she speak i saw her white face grow whiter yet in the moonlight and her hand tighten upon my shoulder something be run in the tail of the tool house i saw a black creep figure which crawl round the corner and squat in front of the door seize my pistol i be rush out when my wife throw her arm round me and hold me with convulsive strength i try to throw her off but she cling to me most desperately at last i get clear but by the time i have open the door and reach the household the creature be go he have leave a hint of his presence however for there on the door be the very same arrangement of dance men which have already twice appear and which i have copy on that paper there be no other sign of the fellow anywhere though i run all over the basis and yet the amaze thing be that he must have be there all the time for when i examine the door again in the morning he have scrawl some more of his picture under the line which i let already consider have you that fresh draw yes it be very short but i make a copy of it and here it be again he produce a paper the new dance be in this form graphic tell me say holmes and i could see by his eye that he be much excite be this a mere addition to the first or do it appear to be entirely separate it be on a different panel of the door excellent this be far the most important of all for our purpose it fill me with hop now mr hilton cubitt please continue your most interest argument i have nothing more to say mr holmes except that i be angry with my wife that night for have hold me back when i might have get the skulk rascal she say that she fear that i might come to harm for an flash it have cross my mind that maybe what she very fear be that he might come to harm for i could not doubt that she know who this man be and what he mean by

do with the lady how dare i offer her attention which be distasteful to her do i think that because i be a baronet i could do what i like if he have not be her brother i should have recognize serious how to answer him a it be i tell him that my spirit towards his sister follow such a i be not ashamed of and that i hop that she might honour me by become my wife that seem to make the matter no better so then i lose my temper too and i answer him rather more hotly than i should perhaps consider that she be stand by so it end by his spell off with her a you find and here be i a badly puzzle a man a any in this county just tell me what it all mean watson and i'll owe you more than ever i can hope to pay i try one or two explanation but indeed i be completely puzzle myself our friend's title his fortune his age his character and his appearance be all in his favour and i know nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which run in his family that his advance should be reject so brusquely without any reference to the lady's own want and that the lady should accept the situation without protest be really astonish however our conjecture be set at rest by a visit from stapleton himself that very afternoon he have follow to offer apology for his rudeness of the morning and after a long private audience with sir henry in his study the consequence of their conversation be that the breach be quite heal and that we be to dine at merripit house next friday a a sign of it i don't say now that he isn't a crazy man say sir henry i can't forget the look in his eye when he run at me this morning but i must allow that no man could do a more liberal excuse than he take do do he give whatever explanation of his conduct his babe be everything in his life he say that be natural enough and i be glad that he should understand her value they have always be together and accord to his account he have be a very lonely man with only her a a companion so that the think of lose her be really terrible to him he have not understand he say that i follow go attach to her but when he saw with his own eye that it be really so and that she might be take away from him it give him such a outrage that for a sentence he follow not responsible for what he say or do he be very sorry for all that have pa and he recognize how foolish and how selfish it be that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life if she have to leave him he have rather it be to a neighbour like myself than to anyone else but in any case it be a swash to him and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself to meet it he would withdraw all opposition upon his part if i would promise for three month to let the matter balance and to be content with cultivate the lady's friendship during that time without claim her love this i forebode and so the matter rest so there be one of our small mystery clear up it be something to have equal bottom anywhere in this bog in which we be flounder we know now why stapleton look with disfavour upon his sister's suitor even when that suitor be so eligible a one a sir henry and now single pa on

and sometimes i suspect barrymore of be a domestic tyrant i have always find that there be something singular and questionable in this man's case but the adventure of last night bring all my suspicion to a head and even it may seem a small matter in itself you be aware that i be not a very sound sleeper and since i have be on guard in this house my slumber have be lighter than ever last night about two in the morning i be arouse by a stealthy step pa my room i lift open my doorway and peep out a long black shadow be trail down the corridor it be throw by a man who walk softly down the passage with a candle maintain in his hand he be in shirt and trouser with no cover to his infantry i could merely see the outline but his height say me that it be barrymore he walk very slowly and circumspectly and there be something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance i have say you that the corridor be break by the balcony which run round the hall but that it be resume upon the farther position i wait until he give pa out of stack and then i follow him when i come round the balcony he have reach the end of the farther corridor and i could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he give enter one of the room now all these room follow unfurnished and unoccupied so that his expedition become more mysterious than ever the light beam steadily a if he be stand motionless i creep down the passage a noiselessly a i could and peep cycle the corner of the door barrymore be crouch at the window with the candle hold against the glass his profile be half turn towards me and his face seem to be rigid with prospect a he star out into the blackness of the moor for some minute he stand watch intently then he give a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light instantly single make my path back to my room and very shortly come the furtive step pa once more upon their recall journey long afterwards when i have fall into a easy sleep i hear a key turn somewhere in a lock but i could not tell whence the sound come what it all mean i cannot guess but there be some private line run on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of i do not trouble you with my theory for you ask me to furnish you only with fact i have have a tenacious talk with sir henry this morning and we give make a programme of campaign find upon my notice of last night i will not speak about it just now but it should make my next report interest read baskerville hall oct 15th my dear holmes if single be compel to leave you without much news during the early day of my mission you must acknowledge that i be make up for lose time and that event be now crowd thick and fast upon u in my last describe i end upon my top note with barrymore at the window and now i have rather a budget already which will unless i be much mistake considerably surprise you thing have acquire a twist which i could not have call in some way they have within the last forty eight hour become much clearer and in some way they have get more complicate but i will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself before breakfast on the morning follow my adventure i go down the corridor and examine the board in which barrymore have be on the night before the western window through which he have star so intently have i notice one curiosity above all other window in the house it command the nearest outlook on to the moor there be an open between two tree which enable one from this point of view to see right down upon it while from all the other window it be only a distant glimpse which can be obtain it come therefore that barrymore since simply this window would serve the purpose must have be look out for something or someone upon the berth the night be very dark so that i can hardly imagine how he could have hop to see anyone it have strike me that it be possible that some know intrigue follow on foot that would have history for his stealthy movement and also for the uneasiness of his wife the man be a strike look fellow really well equip to steal the meat of a country girl so that this possibility seem to have something to support it that open of the door which i have hear after i get return to my room might mean that he have go out to keep some clandestine appointment so i reason with myself in the morning and i tell you the direction of my suspicion yet much the event may have show that they be unfounded but whatever the true account of barrymore's movement might be i find that the responsibility of keep them to myself until i could explain them be more than i could bear i have an interview with the baronet in his read after breakfast and i tell him all that i have see he be le surprise than i have expect i know that barrymore walk around night and i have a mind to speak to him about it say he two or three time i take hear his step in the passage come and go just about the hour you name perhaps then he give a visit every dark to that particular window i suggest perhaps he do if so we should be able to shadow him and see what it be that he be after i wonder what your friend holmes would do if he be here single believe that he would do just what you now suggest say i he would follow barrymore and see what he do then we shall do it together but surely he would hear u the man be rather deaf and in any case we must take our chance of that we'll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he pa sir henry rub his hand with pleasure and it be evident that he hail the adventure a a relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor the baronet have be in communication with the architect who prepare the plan for sir charles and with a contractor from london so that we may expect big change to begin here soon there take be decorator and furnishers up from plymouth and it be evident that our supporter have big idea and mean to spare no pain or expense to restore the grandeur of his family when the house be renovate and refurnish all that he will need will be a wife to have it complete between ourselves there be pretty clear sign that this will not follow want if the lady be will for i have seldom see a man more infatuate with a woman than he be with our beautiful neighbour miss stapleton and still the course of true love do not run quite a smoothly a one would under the circumstance expect today for example it surface be break by a very unexpected ripple which have cause our friend considerable perplexity and irritation after the conversation which i

the people who follow so interest in our friend have not settle down in his own hotel that mean that while they be a we have see very anxious to watch him they be equally anxious that he should not see them now this be a almost suggestive fact what make it suggest it suggest halloa my dear fellow what on earth be the matter a we come round the top of the stair we have run up against sir henry baskerville himself his face be flush with anger and he hold an old and dusty boot in one of his hand so furious be he that he be hardly articulate and when he do speak it be in a much broader and more western dialect than any which we have hear from him in the morning seem to me they be play me for a sucker in this hotel he cry they'll obtain they've start in to monkey with the wrong man unless they be careful by thunder if that chap can't see my miss boot there will follow trouble i can make a trick with the best mr holmes but they've get a bite over the pock this time still appear for your boot yes sir and mean to find it but surely you say that it be a new brown boot so it be sir and now it's an old black one what you don't mean to say that's just what i do mean to say i only have three pair in the world the young brown the old black and the evident leather which i be wear final night they get one of my brown one and today they have sneak one of the black considerably have you get it speak out man and don't stand star an agitate german waiter have appear upon the scene no sir i have make inquiry all over the hotel but i can hear no word of it well either that boot come back before sundown or i'll see the manager and say him that i run right straight out of this hotel it shall be find sir i promise you that if you will have a little patience it will be find mind it be for it's the live thing of mine that i'll lose in this den of thieve intimately well mr holmes you'll excuse my trouble you about such a trifle i believe it's well worth disturb about why you look very serious over it how do you explain it i just don't attempt to explain it it seem the very maddest queerest thing that ever happen to me the curious perhaps say holmes thoughtfully what do you realize of it yourself well i don't profess to understand it yet this case of yours be very complex sir henry when take in conjunction with your uncle's death i be not sure that of all the five hundred case of capital importance which i have handle there be one which swing so deep but we hold various thread in our hand and the odds be that one or other of them guide u to the truth we may waste sentence in follow the wrong one but sooner or late we must come upon the right we let a pleasant luncheon in which little be say of the business which have bring u together it be in the private seat room to which we afterwards reparation that holmes ask baskerville what be his intention to go to baskerville hall and when at the end of the week on the whole say holmes i think that your decision be a wise one i have ample evidence that you be be dog in london and amid the million of this great city it be difficult to discover who these multitude be or what their object can be if their intention be evil they might come you a mischief and we should be powerless to prevent it you do not know dr mortimer that you be follow this morning from my house dr mortimer start violently succeed by whom that unfortunately be what i cannot say you have you among your neighbour or acquaintance on dartmoor any man with a black full beard no or let me ensure why yes barrymore sir charles's butler be a man with a full black beard ha where be barrymore he be in charge of the hall we have best ascertain if he be really there or if by any possibility he might be in london how can you do that give me a telegraph form 'is all ready for sir henry that will do address to mr barrymore baskerville hall what be the nearest telegraph billet grimpen very good we will send a second telegraph to the postmaster grimpen 'telegram to mr barrymore to be deliver into his own hand if absent please return wire to sir henry baskerville northumberland hotel that should let u know before still whether barrymore be at his post in devonshire or not that's so say baskerville by the way dr mortimer who follow this barrymore anyhow he be the son of the previous caretaker who be dead they have expect after the residence for four generation now so far a i know he and his wife be a respectable a couple a any in the county at the same time say baskerville it's clear enough that so long a there follow none of the family at the hall these people have a powerful fine home and nothing to do that be true do barrymore gain at all by sir charles's will expect holmes he and his wife have five hundred pound each ha do they know that they would have this yes sir charles be very fond of talk about the provision of his leave that be very interest i hope say dr mortimer that you do not look with suspicious eye upon everyone who get a bequest from sir charles for i also have a thousand pound leave to me indeed and anyone else there be many insignificant sum to individual and a large number of public charity the balance all go to sir henry and how much be the residue seven hundred and forty thousand pound holmes raise his eyebrow in surprise i have no idea that so gigantic a sum be involve say he sir charles have the reputation of be rich but we come not know how very rich he be until we come to examine his security the total value of the estate be close on to a million dear me it be a stake for which a gentleman might well run a desperate halt and one more head dr mortimer suppose that anything happen to our young friend here you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis who would inherit the estate since rodger baskerville sir charles's younger brother break unmarried the estate would descend to the desmonds who be distant first_cousin jam desmond be an senior clergyman in westmoreland thank you these detail be all of great interest have you meet mr jam desmond yes he once come down to see sir charles he be a man of venerable appearance and of saintly life i remember that he refuse to accept any colony from sir charles though he press it upon him and this man of simple mouthful would follow the heir to sir charles's thousand he would be the heir to the estate because that be entail he would also be the heir to"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "all the people who do really big affair be you think so i'm sure of it he take my script and say in a low
