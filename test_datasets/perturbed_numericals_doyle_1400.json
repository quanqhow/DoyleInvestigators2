[{"label": "doyle", "text": "With these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began the following remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical manner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough. I can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had access to Lestrade's note-book, in which the prisoner's words were taken down exactly as they were uttered. \"It don't much matter to you why I hated these men,\" he said; \"it's enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings--a father and a daughter--and that they had, therefore, forfeited their own lives. After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime, it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court. I knew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should be judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one. You'd have done the same, if you have any manhood in you, if you had been in my place. \"That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago. She was forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart over it. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished. I have carried it about with me, and have followed him and his accomplice over two continents until I caught them. They thought to tire me out, but they could not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is likely enough, I die knowing that my work in this world is done, and well done. They have perished, and by my hand. There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to desire. \"They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to follow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I found that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving and riding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cabowner's office, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum a week to the owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself. There was seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The hardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the mazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most confusing. I had a map beside me though, and when once I had spotted the principal hotels and stations, I got on pretty well. \"It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across them. They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other side of the river. When once I found them out I knew that I had them at my mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their recognizing me. I would dog them and follow them until I saw my opportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me again. \"They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about London, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my cab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they could not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or late at night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behind hand with my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted. \"They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone, and never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every day, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half the time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I watched them late and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I was not discouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost come. My only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon and leave my work undone. \"At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the street was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to their door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a time Drebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up my horse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I feared that they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston Station they got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on to the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in the bustle that I could hear every word that passed between them. Drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do, and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated with him, and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the matter was a delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch what Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that he must not presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at Halliday's Private Hotel; to which Drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven, and made his way out of the station. \"The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my enemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue precipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and returned; but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate constructed. By means of this I had access to at least one spot in this great city where I could rely upon being free from interruption. How to get Drebber to that house was the difficult problem which I had now to solve. \"He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, staying for nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out he staggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was a hansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets, until, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the Terrace in which he had boarded. I could not imagine what his intention was in returning there; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from the house. He entered it, and his hansom drove away. Give me a glass of water, if you please. My mouth gets dry with"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "If you do, all will be in vain. Your unknown friend.' Well, really, this is a very pretty little mystery. What do you intend to do, Miss Morstan?\" \"That is exactly what I want to ask you.\" \"Then we shall most certainly go. You and I and--yes, why, Dr. Watson is the very man. Your correspondent says two friends. He and I have worked together before.\" \"But would he come?\" she asked, with something appealing in her voice and expression. \"I should be proud and happy,\" said I, fervently, \"if I can be of any service.\" \"You are both very kind,\" she answered. \"I have led a retired life, and have no friends whom I could appeal to. If I am here at six it will do, I suppose?\" \"You must not be later,\" said Holmes. \"There is one other point, however. Is this handwriting the same as that upon the pearl-box addresses?\" \"I have them here,\" she answered, producing half a dozen pieces of paper. \"You are certainly a model client. You have the correct intuition. Let us see, now.\" He spread out the papers upon the table, and gave little darting glances from one to the other. \"They are disguised hands, except the letter,\" he said, presently, \"but there can be no question as to the authorship. See how the irrepressible Greek e will break out, and see the twirl of the final s. They are undoubtedly by the same person. I should not like to suggest false hopes, Miss Morstan, but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of your father?\" \"Nothing could be more unlike.\" \"I expected to hear you say so. We shall look out for you, then, at six. Pray allow me to keep the papers. I may look into the matter before then. It is only half-past three. Au revoir, then.\" \"Au revoir,\" said our visitor, and, with a bright, kindly glance from one to the other of us, she replaced her pearl-box in her bosom and hurried away. Standing at the window, I watched her walking briskly down the street, until the gray turban and white feather were but a speck in the sombre crowd. \"What a very attractive woman!\" I exclaimed, turning to my companion. He had lit his pipe again, and was leaning back with drooping eyelids. \"Is she?\" he said, languidly. \"I did not observe.\" \"You really are an automaton,--a calculating-machine!\" I cried. \"There is something positively inhuman in you at times.\" He smiled gently. \"It is of the first importance,\" he said, \"not to allow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities. A client is to me a mere unit,--a factor in a problem. The emotional qualities are antagonistic to clear reasoning. I assure you that the most winning woman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children for their insurance-money, and the most repellant man of my acquaintance is a philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a million upon the London poor.\" \"In this case, however--\" \"I never make exceptions. An exception disproves the rule. Have you ever had occasion to study character in handwriting? What do you make of this fellow's scribble?\" \"It is legible and regular,\" I answered. \"A man of business habits and some force of character.\" Holmes shook his head. \"Look at his long letters,\" he said. \"They hardly rise above the common herd. That d might be an a, and that l an e. Men of character always differentiate their long letters, however illegibly they may write. There is vacillation in his k's and self-esteem in his capitals. I am going out now. I have some few references to make. Let me recommend this book,--one of the most remarkable ever penned. It is Winwood Reade's 'Martyrdom of Man.' I shall be back in an hour.\" I sat in the window with the volume in my hand, but my thoughts were far from the daring speculations of the writer. My mind ran upon our late visitor,--her smiles, the deep rich tones of her voice, the strange mystery which overhung her life. If she were seventeen at the time of her father's disappearance she must be seven-and-twenty now,--a sweet age, when youth has lost its self-consciousness and become a little sobered by experience. So I sat and mused, until such dangerous thoughts came into my head that I hurried away to my desk and plunged furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology. What was I, an army surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker banking-account, that I should dare to think of such things? She was a unit, a factor,--nothing more. If my future were black, it was better surely to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will-o'-the-wisps of the imagination. It was half-past five before Holmes returned. He was bright, eager, and in excellent spirits,--a mood which in his case alternated with fits of the blackest depression. \"There is no great mystery in this matter,\" he said, taking the cup of tea which I had poured out for him. \"The facts appear to admit of only one explanation.\" \"What! you have solved it already?\" \"Well, that would be too much to say. I have discovered a suggestive fact, that is all. It is, however, VERY suggestive. The details are still to be added. I have just found, on consulting the back files of the Times, that Major Sholto, of Upper Norword, late of the thirty-fourth Bombay Infantry, died upon the twenty-eightth of April, one thousand, eight hundred and eighty-two.\" \"I may be very obtuse, Holmes, but I fail to see what this suggests.\" \"No? You surprise me. Look at it in this way, then. Captain Morstan disappears. The only person in London whom he could have visited is Major Sholto. Major Sholto denies having heard that he was in London. Four years later Sholto dies. WITHIN A WEEK OF HIS DEATH Captain Morstan's daughter receives a valuable present, which is repeated from year to year, and now culminates in a letter which describes her as a wronged woman. What wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her father? And why should the presents begin immediately after Sholto's death, unless it is that Sholto's heir knows something of the mystery and desires to make compensation? Have you any alternative theory which will meet the facts?\" \"But what a strange compensation! And how strangely made! Why, too, should he write a letter now, rather than six years ago? Again, the letter speaks of giving her justice. What justice can she have? It is too much to suppose that her father is still alive. There is no other injustice in her case that you know of.\" \"There are difficulties; there are certainly difficulties,\" said Sherlock Holmes, pensively. \"But our expedition of to-night will solve them all. Ah, here is a four-wheeler, and Miss Morstan is inside. Are you all ready? Then we had better go down, for it is a little past the hour.\" I picked up my hat and my heaviest stick, but I observed that Holmes took his revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket. It was clear that he thought that our night's work might be a serious one. Miss Morstan was muffled in a dark cloak, and her sensitive face was composed, but pale. She must have been more than woman if she did not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we were embarking, yet her self-control was perfect, and she readily answered the few additional questions which Sherlock Holmes put to her. \"Major Sholto was a very particular friend of papa's,\" she said. \"His letters were full of allusions to the major. He and papa were in command of the troops at the Andaman Islands, so they were thrown a great deal together. By the way, a curious paper was found in papa's desk which no one could understand. I don't suppose that it is of the slightest importance, but I thought you might care to see it, so I brought it with me. It is here.\" Holmes unfolded the paper carefully and smoothed it out upon his knee. He then very methodically examined it all over with his double lens. \"It is paper of native Indian manufacture,\" he remarked. \"It has at some time been pinned to a board. The diagram upon"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "A lamp in the fashion of a silver dove was hung from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre of the room. As it burned it filled the air with a subtle and aromatic odor. \"Mr. Thaddeus Sholto,\" said the little man, still jerking and smiling. \"That is my name. You are Miss Morstan, of course. And these gentlemen--\" \"This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and this is Dr. Watson.\" \"A doctor, eh?\" cried he, much excited. \"Have you your stethoscope? Might I ask you--would you have the kindness? I have grave doubts as to my mitral valve, if you would be so very good. The aortic I may rely upon, but I should value your opinion upon the mitral.\" I listened to his heart, as requested, but was unable to find anything amiss, save indeed that he was in an ecstasy of fear, for he shivered from head to foot. \"It appears to be normal,\" I said. \"You have no cause for uneasiness.\" \"You will excuse my anxiety, Miss Morstan,\" he remarked, airily. \"I am a great sufferer, and I have long had suspicions as to that valve. I am delighted to hear that they are unwarranted. Had your father, Miss Morstan, refrained from throwing a strain upon his heart, he might have been alive now.\" I could have struck the man across the face, so hot was I at this callous and off-hand reference to so delicate a matter. Miss Morstan sat down, and her face grew white to the lips. \"I knew in my heart that he was dead,\" said she. \"I can give you every information,\" said he, \"and, what is more, I can do you justice; and I will, too, whatever Brother Bartholomew may say. I am so glad to have your friends here, not only as an escort to you, but also as witnesses to what I am about to do and say. The three of us can show a bold front to Brother Bartholomew. But let us have no outsiders,--no police or officials. We can settle everything satisfactorily among ourselves, without any interference. Nothing would annoy Brother Bartholomew more than any publicity.\" He sat down upon a low settee and blinked at us inquiringly with his weak, watery blue eyes. \"For my part,\" said Holmes, \"whatever you may choose to say will go no further.\" I nodded to show my agreement. \"That is well! That is well!\" said he. \"May I offer you a glass of Chianti, Miss Morstan? Or of Tokay? I keep no other wines. Shall I open a flask? No? Well, then, I trust that you have no objection to tobacco-smoke, to the mild balsamic odor of the Eastern tobacco. I am a little nervous, and I find my hookah an invaluable sedative.\" He applied a taper to the great bowl, and the smoke bubbled merrily through the rose-water. We sat all three in a semicircle, with our heads advanced, and our chins upon our hands, while the strange, jerky little fellow, with his high, shining head, puffed uneasily in the centre. \"When I first determined to make this communication to you,\" said he, \"I might have given you my address, but I feared that you might disregard my request and bring unpleasant people with you. I took the liberty, therefore, of making an appointment in such a way that my man Williams might be able to see you first. We waited long for news of the \"Lone Star\" of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters \"L. S.\" carved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the \"Lone Star.\" On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth. It was early in April in the year 'eighty-three that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits. \"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,\" said he, \"but it's the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you.\" \"What is it, then--a fire?\" \"No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance.\" \"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.\" I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered. \"Good-morning, madam,\" said Holmes cheerily. \"My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering.\" \"It is not cold which makes me shiver,\" said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested. \"What, then?\" \"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.\" She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances. \"You must not fear,\" said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. \"We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see.\" \"You know me, then?\" \"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "Funny about hair: a man never knows he has it until he begins to lose it, but it's different with a girl. Something of the unconventional situation began to dawn on her as she put in the last hair-pin and patted some stray locks to place. \"I have not told you my name,\" she said abruptly. \"I forgot that because I know who you are, you know nothing about me. I am Alison West, and my home is in Richmond.\" So that was it! This was the girl of the photograph on John Gilmore's bedside table. The girl McKnight expected to see in Richmond the next day, Sunday! She was on her way back to meet him! Well, what difference did it make, anyhow? We had been thrown together by the merest chance. In an hour or two at the most we would be back in civilization and she would recall me, if she remembered me at all, as an unshaven creature in a red cravat and tan shoes, with a soiled Pullman sheet tied around my neck. I drew a deep breath. \"Just a twinge,\" I said, when she glanced up quickly. \"It's very good of you to let me know, Miss West. I have been hearing delightful things about you for three months.\" \"From Richey McKnight?\" She was frankly curious. \"Yes. From Richey McKnight,\" I assented. Was it any wonder McKnight was crazy about her? I dug my heels into the dust. \"I have been visiting near Cresson, in the mountains,\" Miss West was saying. \"The person you mentioned, Mrs. Curtis, was my hostess. We--we were on our way to Washington together.\" She spoke slowly, as if she wished to give the minimum of explanation. Across her face had come again the baffling expression of perplexity and trouble I had seen before. \"You were on your way home, I suppose? Richey spoke about seeing you,\" I floundered, finding it necessary to say something. She looked at me with level, direct eyes. \"No,\" she returned quietly. \"I did not intend to go home. I--well, it doesn't matter; I am going home now.\" A woman in a calico dress, with two children, each an exact duplicate of the other, had come quickly down the road. She took in the situation at a glance, and was explosively hospitable. \"You poor things,\" she said. \"If you'll take the first road to the left over there, and turn in at the second pigsty, you will find breakfast on the table and a coffee-pot on the stove. And there's plenty of soap and water, too. Don't say one word. There isn't a soul there to see you.\" We accepted the invitation and she hurried on toward the excitement and the railroad. I got up carefully and helped Miss West to her feet. \"At the second pigsty to the left,\" I repeated, \"we will find the breakfast I promised you seven eternities ago. Forward to the pigsty!\" We said very little for the remainder of that walk. I had almost reached the limit of endurance: with every step the broken ends of the bone grated together. We found the farm-house without difficulty, and I remember wondering if I could hold out to the end of the old stone walk that led between hedges to the door. \"Allah be praised,\" I said with all the voice I could muster. \"Behold the coffee-pot!\" And then I put down the grip and folded up like a jack-knife on the porch floor. When I came around something hot was trickling down my neck, and a despairing voice was saying, \"Oh, I don't seem to be able to pour it into your mouth. Please open your eyes.\" \"But I don't want it in my eyes,\" I replied dreamily. \"I haven't any idea what came over me. It was the shoes, I think: the left one is a red-hot torture.\" I was sitting by that time and looking across into her face. Never before or since have I fainted, but I would do it joyfully, a dozen times a day, if I could waken again to the blissful touch of soft fingers on my face, the hot ecstasy of coffee spilled by those fingers down my neck. There was a thrill in every tone of her voice that morning. Before long my loyalty to McKnight would step between me and the girl he loved: life would develop new complexities. In those early hours after the wreck, full of pain as they were, there was nothing of the suspicion and distrust that came later. Shorn of our gauds and baubles, we were primitive man and woman, together: our world for the hour was the deserted farm-house, the slope of wheat-field that led to the road, the woodland lot, the pasture. We breakfasted together across the homely table. Our cheerfulness, at first sheer reaction, became less forced as we ate great slices of bread from the granny oven back of the house, and drank hot fluid that smelled like coffee and tasted like nothing that I have ever swallowed. We found cream in stone jars, sunk deep in the chill water of the spring house. And there were eggs, great yellow-brown ones,--a basket of them. So, like two children awakened from a nightmare, we chattered over our food: we hunted mutual friends, we laughed together at my feeble witticisms, but we put the horror behind us resolutely. After all, it was the hat with the green ribbons that brought back the strangeness of the situation. All along I had had the impression that Alison West was deliberately putting out of her mind something that obtruded now and then. It brought with it a return of the puzzled expression that I had surprised early in the day, before the wreck. I caught it once, when, breakfast over, she was tightening the sling that held the broken arm. I had prolonged the morning meal as much as I could, but when the wooden clock with the pink roses on the dial pointed to half after ten, and the mother with the duplicate youngsters had not come back, Miss West made the move I had dreaded. \"If we are to get into Baltimore at all we must start,\" she said, rising. \"You ought to see a doctor as soon as possible.\" \"Hush,\" I said warningly. \"Don't mention the arm, please; it is asleep now. You may rouse it.\" \"If I only had a hat,\" she reflected. \"It wouldn't need to be much of one, but--\" She gave a little cry and darted to the corner. \"Look,\" she said triumphantly, \"the very thing. With the green streamers tied up in a bow, like this--do you suppose the child would mind? I can put five dollars or so here--that would buy a dozen of them.\" It was a queer affair of straw, that hat, with a round crown and a rim that flopped dismally. With a single movement she had turned it up at one side and fitted it to her head. Grotesque by itself, when she wore it it was a thing of joy. Evidently the lack of head covering had troubled her, for she was elated at her find. She left me, scrawling a note of thanks and pinning it with a bill to the table-cloth, and ran up-stairs to the mirror and the promised soap and water. I did not see her when she came down. I had discovered a bench with a tin basin outside the kitchen door, and was washing, in a helpless, one-sided way. I felt rather than saw that she was standing in the door-way, and I made a final plunge into the basin. \"How is it possible for a man with only a right hand to wash his left ear?\" I asked from the roller towel. I was distinctly uncomfortable: men are more rigidly creatures of convention than women, whether they admit it or not. \"There is so much soap on me still that if I laugh I will blow bubbles. Washing with rain-water and home-made soap is like motoring on a slippery road. I only struck the high places.\" Then, having achieved a brilliant polish with the towel, I looked at the girl. She was leaning against the frame of the door, her face perfectly colorless, her breath coming in slow, difficult respirations. The erratic hat was pinned to place, but it had slid rakishly to one side. When I realized that she was staring, not at me, but past me to the road along which we had come, I turned and followed her gaze. There was no one in sight: the lane stretched dust white in the sun,--no moving figure on it, no sign of life. The surprising change in her held me speechless. All the animation of the breakfast table was gone: there was no hint of the response with which, before, she had met my nonsensical sallies. She stood there, white-lipped, unsmiling, staring down the dusty road. One hand was clenched tight over some small object. Her eyes dropped to it from the distant road, and then closed, with a quick, indrawn breath. Her color came back slowly. Whatever had caused the change, she said nothing. She was anxious to leave at once, almost impatient over my deliberate masculine way of getting my things together. Afterward I recalled that I had wanted to explore the barn for a horse and some sort of a vehicle to take us to the trolley, and that she had refused to allow me to look. I remembered many things later that might have helped me, and did not. At the time, I was only completely bewildered. Save the wreck, the responsibility for which lay between Providence and the engineer of the second section, all the events of that strange morning were logically connected; they came from one cause, and tended unerringly to one end. But the cause was buried, the end not yet in view. Not until we had left the house well behind did the girl's face relax its tense lines. I was watching her more closely than I had realized, for when we had gone a little way along the road she turned to me almost petulantly. \"Please don't stare so at me,\" she said, to my sudden confusion. \"I know the hat is dreadful. Green always makes me look ghastly.\" \"Perhaps it was the green.\" I was unaccountably relieved. \"Do you know, a few minutes ago, you looked almost pallid to me!\" She glanced at me quickly, but I was gazing ahead. We were out of sight of the house, now, and with every step away from it the girl was obviously relieved. Whatever she held in her hand, she never glanced at it. But she was conscious of it every second. She seemed to come to a decision about it while we were still in sight of the gate, for she murmured something and turned back alone, going swiftly, her feet stirring up small puffs of dust at every step. She fastened something to the gate-post,--I could see the nervous haste with which she worked. When she joined me again it was without explanation. But the clenched fingers were free now, and while she looked tired and worn, the strain had visibly relaxed. We walked along slowly in the general direction of the suburban trolley line. Once a man with an empty wagon offered us a lift, but after a glance at the springless vehicle I declined. \"The ends of the bone think they are castanets as it is,\" I explained. \"But the lady--\"  The young lady, however, declined and we went on together. Once, when the trolley line was in sight, she got a pebble in her low shoe, and we sat down under a tree until she found the cause of the trouble. \"I--I don't know what I should have done without you,\" I blundered. \"Moral support and--and all that. Do you know, my first conscious thought after the wreck was of relief that you had not been hurt?\" She was sitting beside me, where a big chestnut tree shaded the road, and I surprised a look of misery on her face that certainly my words had not been meant to produce. \"And my first thought,\" she said slowly, \"was regret that I--that I hadn't been obliterated, blown out like a candle. Please don't look like that! I am only talking.\" But her lips were trembling, and because the little shams of society are forgotten at times like this, I leaned over and patted her hand lightly, where it rested on the grass beside me. \"You must not say those things,\" I expostulated. \"Perhaps, after all, your friends--\"  \"I had no friends on the train.\" Her voice was hard again, her tone final. She drew her hand from under mine, not quickly, but decisively. A car was in sight, coming toward us. The steel finger of civilization, of propriety, of visiting cards and formal introductions was beckoning us in. Miss West put on her shoe. We said little on the car. The few passengers stared at us frankly, and discussed the wreck, emphasizing its horrors. The girl did not seem to hear. Once she turned to me with the quick, unexpected movement that was one of her charms. \"I do not wish my mother to know I was in the accident,\" she said. \"Will you please not tell Richey about having met me?\" I gave my promise, of course. Again, when we were almost into Baltimore, she asked to examine the gun-metal cigarette case, and sat silent with it in her hands, while I told of the early morning's events on the Ontario. \"So you see,\" I finished, \"this grip, everything I have on, belongs to a fellow named Sullivan. He probably left the train before the wreck,--perhaps just after the murder.\" \"And so--you think he committed the--the crime?\" Her eyes were on the cigarette case. \"Naturally,\" I said. \"A man doesn't jump off a Pullman car in the middle of the night in another man's clothes, unless he is trying to get away from something. Besides the dirk, there were the stains that you saw. Why, I have the murdered man's pocket-book in this valise at my feet. What does that look like?\" I colored when I saw the ghost of a smile hovering around the corners of her mouth. \"That is,\" I finished, \"if you care to believe that I am innocent.\" The sustaining chain of her small gold bag gave way just then. She did not notice it. I picked it up and slid the trinket into my pocket for safekeeping, where I promptly forgot it. Afterwards I wished I had let it lie unnoticed on the floor of that dirty little suburban car, and even now, when I see a woman carelessly dangling a similar feminine trinket, I shudder involuntarily: there comes back to me the memory of a girl's puzzled eyes under the brim of a flopping hat, the haunting suspicion of the sleepless nights that followed. Just then I was determined that my companion should not stray back to the wreck, and to that end I was determinedly facetious. \"Do you know that it is Sunday?\" she asked suddenly, \"and that we are actually ragged?\" \"Never mind that,\" I retorted. \"All Baltimore is divided on Sunday into three parts, those who rise up and go to church, those who rise up and read the newspapers, and those who don't rise up. The first are somewhere between the creed and the sermon, and we need not worry about the others.\" \"You treat me like a child,\" she said almost pettishly. \"Don't try so hard to be cheerful. It--it is almost ghastly.\" After that I subsided like a pricked balloon, and the remainder of the ride was made in silence. The information that she would go to friends in the city was a shock: it meant an earlier separation than I had planned for. But my arm was beginning again. In putting her into a cab I struck it and gritted my teeth with the pain. It was probably for that reason that I forgot the gold bag. She leaned forward and held out her hand. \"I may not have another chance to thank you,\" she said, \"and I think I would better not try, anyhow. I cannot tell you how grateful I am.\" I muttered something about the gratitude being mine: owing to the knock I was seeing two cabs, and two girls were holding out two hands. \"Remember,\" they were both saying, \"you have never met me, Mr. Blakeley. And--if you ever hear anything about me--that is not--pleasant, I want you to think the best you can of me. Will you?\" The two girls were one now, with little flashes of white light playing all around. \"I--I'm afraid that I shall think too well for my own good,\"  I said unsteadily. And the cab drove on. I had my arm done up temporarily in Baltimore and took the next train home. I was pretty far gone when I stumbled out of a cab almost into the scandalized arms of Mrs. Klopton. In fifteen minutes I was in bed, with that good woman piling on blankets and blistering me in unprotected places with hot-water bottles. And in an hour I had a whiff of chloroform and Doctor Williams had set the broken bone. I dropped asleep then, waking in the late twilight to a realization that I was at home again, without the papers that meant conviction for Andy Bronson, with a charge of murder hanging over my head, and with something more than an impression of the girl my best friend was in love with, a girl moreover who was almost as great an enigma as the crime itself. \"And I'm no hand at guessing riddles,\" I groaned half aloud. Mrs. Klopton came over promptly and put a cold cloth on my forehead. \"Euphemia,\" she said to some one outside the door, \"telephone the doctor that he is still rambling, but that he has switched from green ribbons to riddles.\" \"There's nothing the matter with me, Mrs. Klopton,\" I rebelled. \"I was only thinking out loud. Confound that cloth: it's trickling all over me!\" I gave it a fling, and heard it land with a soggy thud on the floor. \"Thinking out loud is delirium,\" Mrs. Klopton said imperturbably. \"A fresh cloth, Euphemia.\" This time she held it on with a firm pressure that I was too weak to resist. I expostulated feebly that I was drowning, which she also laid to my mental exaltation, and then I finally dropped into a damp sleep. It was probably midnight when I roused again. I had been dreaming of the wreck, and it was inexpressibly comforting to feel the stability of my bed, and to realize the equal stability of Mrs. Klopton, who sat, fully attired, by the night light, reading Science and Health. \"Does that book say anything about opening the windows on a hot night?\" I suggested, when I had got my bearings. She put it down immediately and came over to me. If there is one time when Mrs. Klopton is chastened--and it is the only time--it is when she reads Science and Health. \"I don't like to open the shutters, Mr. Lawrence,\" she explained. \"Not since the night you went away.\" But, pressed further, she refused to explain. \"The doctor said you were not to be excited,\" she persisted. \"Here's your beef tea.\" \"Not a drop until you tell me,\" I said firmly. \"Besides, you know very well there's nothing the matter with me. This arm of mine is only a false belief.\" I sat up gingerly. \"Now--why don't you open that window?\" Mrs. Klopton succumbed. \"Because there are queer goings-on in that house next door,\" she said. \"If you will take the beef tea, Mr. Lawrence, I will tell you.\" The queer goings-on, however, proved to be slightly disappointing. It seemed that after I left on Friday night, a light was seen flitting fitfully through the empty house next door. Euphemia had seen it first and called Mrs. Klopton. Together they had watched it breathlessly until it disappeared on the lower floor. \"You should have been a writer of ghost stories,\" I said, giving my pillows a thump. \"Constable,\" he said laconically. \"Veteran of the war, one arm; in office to conciliate the G. A. R. element. Why?\" \"Because I am uneasy to-night.\" And I told him what Liddy had said. \"Is there any one you can think of who could be relied on to watch the outside of the house to-night?\" \"We might get Sam Bohannon from the club,\" he said thoughtfully. \"It wouldn't be a bad scheme. He's a smart darky, and with his mouth shut and his shirt-front covered, you couldn't see him a yard off in the dark.\" "}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion. \"There is no mystery, my dear madam,\" said he, smiling. \"The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver.\" \"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,\" said she. \"I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful.\" Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted. \"Farintosh,\" said he. \"Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter.\" \"Alas!\" replied our visitor, \"the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.\" \"I am all attention, madam.\" \"My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.\" Holmes nodded his head. \"The name is familiar to me,\" said he. \"The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man. \"When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother's re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money--not less than one thousand pounds a year--and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness. \"But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather's case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger. \"Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master. \"You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has.\" \"Your sister is dead, then?\" \"She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.\" Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor. "}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "His instructions were simple. There had been numerous attempts to break into the house; it was the intention, not to drive intruders away, but to capture them. If Sam saw anything suspicious outside, he was to tap at the east entry, where Alex and Halsey were to alternate in keeping watch through the night. It was with a comfortable feeling of security that I went to bed that night. The door between Gertrude's rooms and mine had been opened, and, with the doors into the hall bolted, we were safe enough. Although Liddy persisted in her belief that doors would prove no obstacles to our disturbers. As before, Halsey watched the east entry from ten until two. He had an eye to comfort, and he kept vigil in a heavy oak chair, very large and deep. We went up-stairs rather early, and through the open door Gertrude and I kept up a running fire of conversation. Liddy was brushing my hair, and Gertrude was doing her own, with a long free sweep of her strong round arms. \"Did you know Mrs. Armstrong and Louise are in the village?\" she called. \"No,\" I replied, startled. \"How did you hear it?\" \"I met the oldest Stewart girl to-day, the doctor's daughter, and she told me they had not gone back to town after the funeral. They went directly to that little yellow house next to Doctor Walker's, and are apparently settled there. They took the house furnished for the summer.\" \"Why, it's a bandbox,\" I said. \"I can't imagine Fanny Armstrong in such a place.\" \"It's true, nevertheless. Ella Stewart says Mrs. Armstrong has aged terribly, and looks as if she is hardly able to walk.\" I lay and thought over some of these things until midnight. The electric lights went out then, fading slowly until there was only a red-hot loop to be seen in the bulb, and then even that died away and we were embarked on the darkness of another night. Apparently only a few minutes elapsed, during which my eyes were becoming accustomed to the darkness. Then I noticed that the windows were reflecting a faint pinkish light, Liddy noticed it at the same time, and I heard her jump up. At that moment Sam's deep voice boomed from somewhere just below. \"Fire!\" he yelled. \"The stable's on fire!\" I could see him in the glare dancing up and down on the drive, and a moment later Halsey joined him. Alex was awake and running down the stairs, and in five minutes from the time the fire was discovered, three of the maids were sitting on their trunks in the drive, although, excepting a few sparks, there was no fire nearer than a hundred yards. Gertrude seldom loses her presence of mind, and she ran to the telephone. But by the time the Casanova volunteer fire department came toiling up the hill the stable was a furnace, with the Dragon Fly safe but blistered, in the road. Some gasolene exploded just as the volunteer department got to work, which shook their nerves as well as the burning building. The stable, being on a hill, was a torch to attract the population from every direction. Rumor had it that Sunnyside was burning, and it was amazing how many people threw something over their night-clothes and flew to the conflagration. I take it Casanova has few fires, and Sunnyside was furnishing the people, in one way and another, the greatest excitement they had had for years. The stable was off the west wing. I hardly know how I came to think of the circular staircase and the unguarded door at its foot. Liddy was putting my clothes into sheets, preparatory to tossing them out the window, when I found her, and I could hardly persuade her to stop. \"I want you to come with me, Liddy,\" I said. \"Bring a candle and a couple of blankets.\" She lagged behind considerably when she saw me making for the east wing, and at the top of the staircase she balked. \"I am not going down there,\" she said firmly. \"There is no one guarding the door down there,\" I explained. \"Who knows?--this may be a scheme to draw everybody away from this end of the house, and let some one in here.\" The instant I had said it I was convinced I had hit on the explanation, and that perhaps it was already too late. It seemed to me as I listened that I heard stealthy footsteps on the east porch, but there was so much shouting outside that it was impossible to tell. Liddy was on the point of retreat. \"Very well,\" I said, \"then I shall go down alone. Run back to Mr. Halsey's room and get his revolver. Don't shoot down the stairs if you hear a noise: remember--I shall be down there. And hurry.\" I put the candle on the floor at the top of the staircase and took off my bedroom slippers. Then I crept down the stairs, going very slowly, and listening with all my ears. I was keyed to such a pitch that I felt no fear: like the condemned who sleep and eat the night before execution, I was no longer able to suffer apprehension. I was past that. Just at the foot of the stairs I stubbed my toe against Halsey's big chair, and had to stand on one foot in a soundless agony until the pain subsided to a dull ache. And then--I knew I was right. Some one had put a key into the lock, and was turning it. For some reason it refused to work, and the key was withdrawn. There was a muttering of voices outside: I had only a second. Another trial, and the door would open. The candle above made a faint gleam down the well-like staircase, and at that moment, with a second, no more, to spare, I thought of a plan. The heavy oak chair almost filled the space between the newel post and the door. With a crash I had turned it on its side, wedging it against the door, its legs against the stairs. I could hear a faint scream from Liddy, at the crash, and then she came down the stairs on a run, with the revolver held straight out in front of her. \"Thank God,\" she said, in a shaking voice. \"I thought it was you.\" I pointed to the door, and she understood. \"Call out the windows at the other end of the house,\" I whispered. \"Run. Tell them not to wait for anything.\" She went up the stairs at that, two at a time. Evidently she collided with the candle, for it went out, and I was left in darkness. I was really astonishingly cool. I remember stepping over the chair and gluing my ear to the door, and I shall never forget feeling it give an inch or two there in the darkness, under a steady pressure from without. But the chair held, although I could hear an ominous cracking of one of the legs. And then, without the slightest warning, the card-room window broke with a crash. I had my finger on the trigger of the revolver, and as I jumped it went off, right through the door. Some one outside swore roundly, and for the first time I could hear what was said. \"Only a scratch. . . . Men are at the other end of the house. . . . Have the whole rat's nest on us.\" And a lot of profanity which I won't write down. The voices were at the broken window now, and although I was trembling violently, I was determined that I would hold them until help came. I moved up the stairs until I could see into the card-room, or rather through it, to the window. As I looked a small man put his leg over the sill and stepped into the room. The curtain confused him for a moment; then he turned, not toward me, but toward the billiard-room door. I fired again, and something that was glass or china crashed to the ground. Then I ran up the stairs and along the corridor to the main staircase. Gertrude was standing there, trying to locate the shots, and I must have been a peculiar figure, with my hair in crimps, my dressing-gown flying, no slippers, and a revolver clutched in my hands I had no time to talk. There was the sound of footsteps in the lower hall, and some one bounded up the stairs. I had gone Berserk, I think. I leaned over the stair-rail and fired again. Halsey, below, yelled at me. \"What are you doing up there?\" he yelled. \"You missed me by an inch.\" And then I collapsed and fainted. When I came around Liddy was rubbing my temples with eau de quinine, and the search was in full blast. Well, the man was gone. The stable burned to the ground, while the crowd cheered at every falling rafter, and the volunteer fire department sprayed it with a garden hose. And in the house Alex and Halsey searched every corner of the lower floor, finding no one. The truth of my story was shown by the broken window and the overturned chair. That the unknown had got up-stairs was almost impossible. He had not used the main staircase, there was no way to the upper floor in the east wing, and Liddy had been at the window, in the west wing, where the servants' stair went up. But we did not go to bed at all. Sam Bohannon and Warner helped in the search, and not a closet escaped scrutiny. Even the cellars were given a thorough overhauling, without result. The door in the east entry had a hole through it where my bullet had gone. The hole slanted downward, and the bullet was embedded in the porch. Some reddish stains showed it had done execution. \"Somebody will walk lame,\" Halsey said, when he had marked the course of the bullet. \"It's too low to have hit anything but a leg or foot.\" From that time on I watched every person I met for a limp, and to this day the man who halts in his walk is an object of suspicion to me. But Casanova had no lame men: the nearest approach to it was an old fellow who tended the safety gates at the railroad, and he, I learned on inquiry, had two artificial legs. Our man had gone, and the large and expensive stable at Sunnyside was a heap of smoking rafters and charred boards. Warner swore the fire was incendiary, and in view of the attempt to enter the house, there seemed to be no doubt of it. If Halsey had only taken me fully into his confidence, through the whole affair, it would have been much simpler. If he had been altogether frank about Jack Bailey, and if the day after the fire he had told me what he suspected, there would have been no harrowing period for all of us, with the boy in danger. But young people refuse to profit by the experience of their elders, and sometimes the elders are the ones to suffer. I was much used up the day after the fire, and Gertrude insisted on my going out. The machine was temporarily out of commission, and the carriage horses had been sent to a farm for the summer. Gertrude finally got a trap from the Casanova liveryman, and we went out. Just as we turned from the drive into the road we passed a woman. She had put down a small valise, and stood inspecting the house and grounds minutely. I should hardly have noticed her, had it not been for the fact that she had been horribly disfigured by smallpox. \"Ugh!\" Gertrude said, when we had passed, \"what a face! I shall dream of it to-night. Get up, Flinders.\" \"Flinders?\" I asked. \"Is that the horse's name?\" \"It is.\" She flicked the horse's stubby mane with the whip. \"He didn't look like a livery horse, and the liveryman said he had bought him from the Armstrongs when they purchased a couple of motors and cut down the stable. Nice Flinders--good old boy!\" Flinders was certainly not a common name for a horse, and yet the youngster at Richfield had named his prancing, curly-haired little horse Flinders! It set me to thinking. At my request Halsey had already sent word of the fire to the agent from whom we had secured the house. Also, he had called Mr. Jamieson by telephone, and somewhat guardedly had told him of the previous night's events. Mr. Jamieson promised to come out that night, and to bring another man with him. I did not consider it necessary to notify Mrs. Armstrong, in the village. No doubt she knew of the fire, and in view of my refusal to give up the house, an interview would probably have been unpleasant enough. But as we passed Doctor Walker's white and green house I thought of something. \"Stop here, Gertrude,\" I said. \"I am going to get out.\" \"To see Louise?\" she asked. \"No, I want to ask this young Walker something.\" She was curious, I knew, but I did not wait to explain. I went up the walk to the house, where a brass sign at the side announced the office, and went in. The reception-room was empty, but from the consulting-room beyond came the sound of two voices, not very amicable. \"It is an outrageous figure,\" some one was storming. Then the doctor's quiet tone, evidently not arguing, merely stating something. But I had not time to listen to some person probably disputing his bill, so I coughed. The voices ceased at once: a door closed somewhere, and the doctor entered from the hall of the house. He looked sufficiently surprised at seeing me. \"Good afternoon, Doctor,\" I said formally. \"I shall not keep you from your patient. I wish merely to ask you a question.\" \"Won't you sit down?\" \"It will not be necessary. Doctor, has any one come to you, either early this morning or to-day, to have you treat a bullet wound?\" \"Nothing so startling has happened to me,\" he said. \"A bullet wound! Things must be lively at Sunnyside.\" \"I didn't say it was at Sunnyside. But as it happens, it was. If any such case comes to you, will it be too much trouble for you to let me know?\" \"I shall be only too happy,\" he said. \"I understand you have had a fire up there, too. A fire and shooting in one night is rather lively for a quiet place like that.\" \"It is as quiet as a boiler-shop,\" I replied, as I turned to go. \"And you are still going to stay?\" \"Until I am burned out,\" I responded. And then on my way down the steps, I turned around suddenly. \"Doctor,\" I asked at a venture, \"have you ever heard of a child named Lucien Wallace?\" Clever as he was, his face changed and stiffened. He was on his guard again in a moment. \"Lucien Wallace?\" he repeated. \"No, I think not. There are plenty of Wallaces around, but I don't know any Lucien.\" I was as certain as possible that he did. People do not lie readily to me, and this man lied beyond a doubt. But there was nothing to be gained now; his defenses were up, and I left, half irritated and wholly baffled. Our reception was entirely different at Doctor Stewart's. Taken into the bosom of the family at once, Flinders tied outside and nibbling the grass at the roadside, Gertrude and I drank some home-made elderberry wine and told briefly of the fire. Of the more serious part of the night's experience, of course, we said nothing. But when at last we had left the family on the porch and the good doctor was untying our steed, I asked him the same question I had put to Doctor Walker. \"Shot!\" he said. \"Bless my soul, no. Why, what have you been doing up at the big house, Miss Innes?\" \"Some one tried to enter the house during the fire, and was shot and slightly injured,\" I said hastily. \"Please don't mention it; we wish to make as little of it as possible.\" There was one other possibility, and we tried that. At Casanova station I saw the station master, and asked him if any trains left Casanova between one o'clock and daylight. There was none until six A.M. The next question required more diplomacy. \"Did you notice on the six-o'clock train any person--any man--who limped a little?\" I asked. \"Please try to remember: we are trying to trace a man who was seen loitering around Sunnyside last night before the fire.\" He was all attention in a moment. \"I was up there myself at the fire,\" he said volubly. \"I'm a member of the volunteer company. First big fire we've had since the summer house burned over to the club golf links. My wife was sayin' the other day, 'Dave, you might as well 'a' saved the money in that there helmet and shirt.' And here last night they came in handy. Rang that bell so hard I hadn't time scarcely to get 'em on.\" \"And--did you see a man who limped?\" Gertrude put in, as he stopped for breath. \"Not at the train, ma'm,\" he said. \"No such person got on here to-day. But I'll tell you where I did see a man that limped. I didn't wait till the fire company left; there's a fast freight goes through at four forty-five, and I had to get down to the station. I seen there wasn't much more to do anyhow at the fire--we'd got the flames under control\"--Gertrude looked at me and smiled--\"so I started down the hill. There was folks here and there goin' home, and along by the path to the Country Club I seen two men. One was a short fellow. He was sitting on a big rock, his back to me, and he had something white in his hand, as if he was tying up his foot. After I'd gone on a piece I looked back, and he was hobbling on and--excuse me, miss--he was swearing something sickening.\" \"Did they go toward the club?\" Gertrude asked suddenly, leaning forward. \"No, miss. I think they came into the village. I didn't get a look at their faces, but I know every chick and child in the place, and everybody knows me. When they didn't shout at me--in my uniform, you know--I took it they were strangers.\" So all we had for our afternoon's work was this: some one had been shot by the bullet that went through the door; he had not left the village, and he had not called in a physician. Also, Doctor Walker knew who Lucien Wallace was, and his very denial made me confident that, in that one direction at least, we were on the right track. The thought that the detective would be there that night was the most cheering thing of all, and I think even Gertrude was glad of it. Driving home that afternoon, I saw her in the clear sunlight for the first time in several days, and I was startled to see how ill she looked. She was thin and colorless, and all her bright animation was gone. \"Gertrude,\" I said, \"I have been a very selfish old woman. You are going to leave this miserable house to-night. Annie Morton is going to Scotland next week, and you shall go right with her.\" To my surprise, she flushed painfully. \"I don't want to go, Aunt Ray,\" she said. \"Don't make me leave now.\" \"You are losing your health and your good looks,\" I said decidedly. \"You should have a change.\" \"I shan't stir a foot.\" She was equally decided. Then, more lightly: \"Why, you and Liddy need me to arbitrate between you every day in the week.\" He closed the vestibule door behind him and cavalierly turned out the light. Our dialogue was sharp, staccato. \"Have you a key to the empty house next door?\" he demanded. \"Somebody's in there, and the latch is caught.\" \"The houses are alike. The key to this door may fit. Did you see them go in?\" \"No. There's a light moving up from room to room. I saw something like it last night, and I have been watching. The patrolman reported queer doings there a week or so ago.\" \"A light!\" I exclaimed. \"Do you mean that you--\"  \"Very likely,\" he said grimly. \"Have you a revolver?\" \"All kinds in the gun rack,\" I replied, and going into the den, I came back with a Smith and Wesson. \"I'm not much use,\" I explained, \"with"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "What was I doing with the lady? How dared I offer her attentions which were distasteful to her? Did I think that because I was a baronet I could do what I liked? If he had not been her brother I should have known better how to answer him. As it was I told him that my feelings towards his sister were such as I was not ashamed of, and that I hoped that she might honour me by becoming my wife. That seemed to make the matter no better, so then I lost my temper too, and I answered him rather more hotly than I should perhaps, considering that she was standing by. So it ended by his going off with her, as you saw, and here am I as badly puzzled a man as any in this county. Just tell me what it all means, Watson, and I'll owe you more than ever I can hope to pay.\" I tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I was completely puzzled myself. Our friend's title, his fortune, his age, his character, and his appearance are all in his favour, and I know nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which runs in his family. That his advances should be rejected so brusquely without any reference to the lady's own wishes and that the lady should accept the situation without protest is very amazing. However, our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from Stapleton himself that very afternoon. He had come to offer apologies for his rudeness of the morning, and after a long private interview with Sir Henry in his study the upshot of their conversation was that the breach is quite healed, and that we are to dine at Merripit House next Friday as a sign of it. \"I don't say now that he isn't a crazy man,\" said Sir Henry; \"I can't forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning, but I must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he has done.\" \"Did he give any explanation of his conduct?\" \"His sister is everything in his life, he says. That is natural enough, and I am glad that he should understand her value. They have always been together, and according to his account he has been a very lonely man with only her as a companion, so that the thought of losing her was really terrible to him. He had not understood, he said, that I was becoming attached to her, but when he saw with his own eyes that it was really so, and that she might be taken away from him, it gave him such a shock that for a time he was not responsible for what he said or did. He was very sorry for all that had passed, and he recognized how foolish and how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life. If she had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like myself than to anyone else. But in any case it was a blow to him and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself to meet it. He would withdraw all opposition upon his part if I would promise for three months to let the matter rest and to be content with cultivating the lady's friendship during that time without claiming her love. This I promised, and so the matter rests.\" So there is one of our small mysteries cleared up. It is something to have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we are floundering. We know now why Stapleton looked with disfavour upon his sister's suitor--even when that suitor was so eligible a one as Sir Henry. And now I pass on to another thread which I have extricated out of the tangled skein, the mystery of the sobs in the night, of the tear-stained face of Mrs. I'm not so light to lift as I used to be.\" Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this proposition rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner at his word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ancles. [twenty-three] He rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself that they were free once more. I remember that I thought to myself, as I eyed him, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man; and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was as formidable as his personal strength. \"If there's a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you are the man for it,\" he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my fellow-lodger. \"The way you kept on my trail was a caution.\" \"You had better come with me,\" said Holmes to the two detectives. \"I can drive you,\" said Lestrade. \"Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us.\" I assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made no attempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his, and we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse, and brought us in a very short time to our destination. We were ushered into a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner's name and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged. The official was a white-faced unemotional man, who went through his duties in a dull mechanical way. \"The prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the course of the week,\" he said; \"in the mean time, Mr. Jefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say? I must warn you that your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.\" \"I've got a good deal to say,\" our prisoner said slowly. \"I want to tell you gentlemen all about it.\" \"Hadn't you better reserve that for your trial?\" asked the Inspector. \"I may never be tried,\" he answered. \"You needn't look startled. It isn't suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?\" He turned his fierce dark eyes upon me as he asked this last question. \"Yes; I am,\" I answered. \"Then put your hand here,\" he said, with a smile, motioning with his manacled wrists towards his chest. I did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and commotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful engine was at work. In the silence of the room I could hear a dull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source. \"Why,\" I cried, \"you have an aortic aneurism!\" \"That's what they call it,\" he said, placidly. \"I went to a Doctor last week about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before many days passed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from over-exposure and under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I've done my work now, and I don't care how soon I go, but I should like to leave some account of the business behind me. I don't want to be remembered as a common cut-throat.\" The Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the advisability of allowing him to tell his story. \"Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?\" the former asked, [twenty-four] \"Most certainly there is,\" I answered. \"In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to take his statement,\" said the Inspector. \"You are at liberty, sir, to give your account, which I again warn you will be taken down.\" \"I'll sit down, with your leave,\" the prisoner said, suiting the action to the word. \"This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and the tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I'm on the brink of the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I say is the absolute truth, and how you use it is"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "Will explain to-morrow.\" She addressed it to Tommy at his club, from which in one short month he would have to resign, unless a kindly fortune permitted him to renew his subscription. \"It may catch him,\" she murmured. \"Anyway, it's worth trying.\" After handing it over the counter she set out briskly for home, stopping at a baker's to buy three penny-worth of new buns. Later, in her tiny cubicle at the top of the house she munched buns and reflected on the future. What was the Esthonia Glassware Co., and what earthly need could it have for her services? A pleasurable thrill of excitement made Tuppence tingle. At any rate, the country vicarage had retreated into the background again. The morrow held possibilities. It was a long time before Tuppence went to sleep that night, and, when at length she did, she dreamed that Mr. Whittington had set her to washing up a pile of Esthonia Glassware, which bore an unaccountable resemblance to hospital plates! It wanted some five minutes to eleven when Tuppence reached the block of buildings in which the offices of the Esthonia Glassware Co. were situated. To arrive before the time would look over-eager. So Tuppence decided to walk to the end of the street and back again. She did so. On the stroke of eleven she plunged into the recesses of the building. The Esthonia Glassware Co. was on the top floor. There was a lift, but Tuppence chose to walk up. Slightly out of breath, she came to a halt outside the ground glass door with the legend painted across it \"Esthonia Glassware Co.\" Tuppence knocked. In response to a voice from within, she turned the handle and walked into a small rather dirty outer office. A middle-aged clerk got down from a high stool at a desk near the window and came towards her inquiringly. \"I have an appointment with Mr. Whittington,\" said Tuppence. \"Will you come this way, please.\" He crossed to a partition door with \"Private\" on it, knocked, then opened the door and stood aside to let her pass in. Mr. Whittington was seated behind a large desk covered with papers. Tuppence felt her previous judgment confirmed. There was something wrong about Mr. Whittington. The combination of his sleek prosperity and his shifty eye was not attractive. He looked up and nodded. \"So you've turned up all right? That's good. Sit down, will you?\" Tuppence sat down on the chair facing him. She looked particularly small and demure this morning. She sat there meekly with downcast eyes whilst Mr. Whittington sorted and rustled amongst his papers. Finally he pushed them away, and leaned over the desk. \"Now, my dear young lady, let us come to business.\" His large face broadened into a smile. \"You want work? Well, I have work to offer you. What should you say now to \u00a3100 down, and all expenses paid?\" Mr. Whittington leaned back in his chair, and thrust his thumbs into the arm-holes of his waistcoat. Tuppence eyed him warily. \"And the nature of the work?\" she demanded. \"Nominal--purely nominal. A pleasant trip, that is all.\" \"Where to?\" Mr. Whittington smiled again. \"Paris.\" \"Oh!\" said Tuppence thoughtfully. To herself she said: \"Of course, if father heard that he would have a fit! But somehow I don't see Mr. Whittington in the role of the gay deceiver.\" \"Yes,\" continued Whittington. \"What could be more delightful? To put the clock back a few years--a very few, I am sure--and re-enter one of those charming _pensionnats de jeunes filles_ with which Paris abounds----\" Tuppence interrupted him. \"A _pensionnat?_\" \"Exactly. Madame Colombier's in the Avenue de Neuilly.\" Tuppence knew the name well. Nothing could have been more select. She had had several American friends there. She was more than ever puzzled. \"You want me to go to Madame Colombier's? For how long?\" \"That depends. Possibly three months.\" \"And that is all? There are no other conditions?\" \"None whatever. You would, of course, go in the character of my ward, and you would hold no communication with your friends. I should have to request absolute secrecy for the time being. By the way, you are English, are you not?\" \"Yes.\" \"Yet you speak with a slight American accent?\" \"My great pal in hospital was a little American girl. I dare say I picked it up from her. I can soon get out of it again.\" \"On the contrary, it might be simpler for you to pass as an American. Details about your past life in England might be more difficult to sustain. Yes, I think that would be decidedly better. Then----\" \"One moment, Mr. Whittington! You seem to be taking my consent for granted.\" Whittington looked surprised. \"Surely you are not thinking of refusing? I can assure you that Madame Colombier's is a most high-class and orthodox establishment. And the terms are most liberal.\" \"Exactly,\" said Tuppence. \"That's just it. The terms are almost too liberal, Mr. Whittington. I cannot see any way in which I can be worth that amount of money to you.\" \"No?\" said Whittington softly. \"Well, I will tell you. I could doubtless obtain some one else for very much less. What I am willing to pay for is a young lady with sufficient intelligence and presence of mind to sustain her part well, and also one who will have sufficient discretion not to ask too many questions.\" Tuppence smiled a little. She felt that Whittington had scored. \"There's another thing. So far there has been no mention of Mr. Beresford. Where does he come in?\" \"Mr. Beresford?\" \"My partner,\" said Tuppence with dignity. \"You saw us together yesterday.\" \"Ah, yes. But I'm afraid we shan't require his services.\" \"Then it's off!\" Tuppence rose. \"It's both or neither. Sorry--but that's how it is. Good morning, Mr. Whittington.\" \"Wait a minute. Let us see if something can't be managed. Sit down again, Miss----\" He paused interrogatively. Tuppence's conscience gave her a passing twinge as she remembered the archdeacon. She seized hurriedly on the first name that came into her head. \"Jane Finn,\" she said hastily; and then paused open-mouthed at the effect of those two simple words. All the geniality had faded out of Whittington's face. It was purple with rage, and the veins stood out on the forehead. And behind it all there lurked a sort of incredulous dismay. He leaned forward and hissed savagely: \"So that's your little game, is it?\" Tuppence, though utterly taken aback, nevertheless kept her head. She had not the faintest comprehension of his meaning, but she was naturally quick-witted, and felt it imperative to \"keep her end up\" as she phrased it. Whittington went on: \"Been playing with me, have you, all the time, like a cat and mouse? Knew all the time what I wanted you for, but kept up the comedy. Is that it, eh?\" He was cooling down. The red colour was ebbing out of his face. He eyed her keenly. \"Who's been blabbing? Rita?\" Tuppence shook her head. She was doubtful as to how long she could sustain this illusion, but she realized the importance of not dragging an unknown Rita into it. \"No,\" she replied with perfect truth. \"Rita knows nothing about me.\" His eyes still bored into her like gimlets. \"How much do you know?\" he shot out. \"Very little indeed,\" answered Tuppence, and was pleased to note that Whittington's uneasiness was augmented instead of allayed. To have boasted that she knew a lot might have raised doubts in his mind. \"Anyway,\" snarled Whittington, \"you knew enough to come in here and plump out that name.\" \"It might be my own name,\" Tuppence pointed out. \"It's likely, isn't it, then there would be two girls with a name like that?\" \"Or I might just have hit upon it by chance,\" continued Tuppence, intoxicated with the success of truthfulness. Mr. Whittington brought his fist down upon the desk with a bang. \"Quit fooling! How much do you know? And how much do you want?\" The last five words took Tuppence's fancy mightily, especially after a meagre breakfast and a supper of buns the night before. Her present part was of the adventuress rather than the adventurous order, but she did not deny its possibilities. She sat up and smiled with the air of one who has the situation thoroughly well in hand. \"My dear Mr. Whittington,\" she said, \"let us by all means lay our cards upon the table. And pray do not be so angry. You heard me say yesterday that I proposed to live by my wits. It seems to me that I have now proved I have some wits to live by! I admit I have knowledge of a certain name, but perhaps my knowledge ends there.\" \"Yes--and perhaps it doesn't,\" snarled Whittington. \"You insist on misjudging me,\" said Tuppence, and sighed gently. \"As I said once before,\" said Whittington angrily, \"quit fooling, and come to the point. You can't play the innocent with me. You know a great deal more than you're willing to admit.\" Tuppence paused a moment to admire her own ingenuity, and then said softly: \"I shouldn't like to contradict you, Mr. Whittington.\" \"So we come to the usual question--how much?\" Tuppence was in a dilemma. So far she had fooled Whittington with complete success, but to mention a palpably impossible sum might awaken his suspicions. An idea flashed across her brain. \"Suppose we say a little something down, and a fuller discussion of the matter later?\" Whittington gave her an ugly glance. \"Blackmail, eh?\" Tuppence smiled sweetly. \"Oh no! Shall we say payment of services in advance?\" Whittington grunted. \"You see,\" explained Tuppence still sweetly, \"I'm so very fond of money!\" \"You're about the limit, that's what you are,\" growled Whittington, with a sort of unwilling admiration. \"You took me in all right. Thought you were quite a meek little kid with just enough brains for my purpose.\" \"Life,\" moralized Tuppence, \"is full of surprises.\" \"All the same,\" continued Whittington, \"some one's been talking. You say it isn't Rita. Was it----? Oh, come in.\" The clerk followed his discreet knock into the room, and laid a paper at his master's elbow. \"Telephone message just come for you, sir.\" Whittington snatched it up and read it. A frown gathered on his brow. \"That'll do, Brown. You can go.\" The clerk withdrew, closing the door behind him. Whittington turned to Tuppence. \"Come to-morrow at the same time. I'm busy now. Here's fifty to go on with.\" He rapidly sorted out some notes, and pushed them across the table to Tuppence, then stood up, obviously impatient for her to go. The girl counted the notes in a businesslike manner, secured them in her handbag, and rose. \"Good morning, Mr. Whittington,\" she said politely. \"At least, au revoir, I should say.\" \"Exactly. Au revoir!\" Whittington looked almost genial again, a reversion that aroused in Tuppence a faint misgiving. \"Au revoir, my clever and charming young lady.\" Tuppence sped lightly down the stairs. A wild elation possessed her. A neighbouring clock showed the time to be five minutes to twelve. \"Let's give Tommy a surprise!\" murmured Tuppence, and hailed a taxi. The cab drew up outside the tube station. Tommy was just within the entrance. His eyes opened to their fullest extent as he hurried forward to assist Tuppence to alight. She smiled at him affectionately, and remarked in a slightly affected voice: \"Pay the thing, will you, old bean? I've got nothing smaller than a five-pound note!\" THE moment was not quite so triumphant as it ought to have been. To begin with, the resources of Tommy's pockets were somewhat limited. In the end the fare was managed, the lady recollecting a plebeian twopence, and the driver, still holding the varied assortment of coins in his hand, was prevailed upon to move on, which he did after one last hoarse demand as to what the gentleman thought he was giving him? \"I think you've given him too much, Tommy,\" said Tuppence innocently. \"I fancy he wants to give some of it back.\" It was possibly this remark which induced the driver to move away. \"Well,\" said Mr. Beresford, at length able to relieve his feelings, \"what the--dickens, did you want to take a taxi for?\" \"I was afraid I might be late and keep you waiting,\" said Tuppence gently. \"Afraid--you--might--be--late! Oh, Lord, I give it up!\" said Mr. Beresford. \"And really and truly,\" continued Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide, \"I haven't got anything smaller than a five-pound note.\" \"You did that part of it very well, old bean, but all the same the fellow wasn't taken in--not for a moment!\" \"No,\" said Tuppence thoughtfully, \"he didn't believe it. That's the curious part about speaking the truth. No one does believe it. I found that out this morning. Now let's go to lunch. How about the _Savoy?_\" Tommy grinned. \"How about the _Ritz?_\" \"On second thoughts, I prefer the _Piccadilly_. It's nearer. We shan't have to take another taxi. Come along.\" \"Is this a new brand of humour? Or is your brain really unhinged?\" inquired Tommy. \"Your last supposition is the correct one. I have come into money, and the shock has been too much for me! For that particular form of mental trouble an eminent physician recommends unlimited _Hors d'\u0153uvre_, Lobster _\u00e0 l'am\u00e9ricane_, Chicken Newberg, and P\u00eache Melba! Let's go and get them!\" \"Tuppence, old girl, what has really come over you?\" \"Oh, unbelieving one!\" Tuppence wrenched open her bag. \"Look here, and here, and here!\" \"Great Jehosaphat! My dear girl, don't wave Fishers aloft like that!\" \"They're not Fishers. They're five times better than Fishers, and this one's ten times better!\" Tommy groaned. \"I must have been drinking unawares! Am I dreaming, Tuppence, or do I really behold a large quantity of five-pound notes being waved about in a dangerous fashion?\" \"Even so, O King! _Now_, will you come and have lunch?\" \"I'll come anywhere. But what have you been doing? Holding up a bank?\" \"All in good time. What an awful place Piccadilly Circus is. There's a huge bus bearing down on us. It would be too terrible if they killed the five-pound notes!\" \"Grill room?\" inquired Tommy, as they reached the opposite pavement in safety. \"The other's more expensive,\" demurred Tuppence. \"That's mere wicked wanton extravagance. Come on below.\" \"Are you sure I can get all the things I want there?\" \"That extremely unwholesome menu you were outlining just now? Of course you can--or as much as is good for you, anyway.\" \"And now tell me,\" said Tommy, unable to restrain his pent-up curiosity any longer, as they sat in state surrounded by the many _hors d'\u0153uvre_ of Tuppence's dreams. Miss Cowley told him. \"And the curious part of it is,\" she ended, \"that I really did invent the name of Jane Finn! I didn't want to give my own because of poor father--in case I should get mixed up in anything shady.\" \"Perhaps that's so,\" said Tommy slowly. \"But you didn't invent it.\" \"What?\" \"No. _I_ told it to you. Don't you remember, I said yesterday I'd overheard two people talking about a female called Jane Finn? That's what brought the name into your mind so pat.\" \"So you did. I remember now. How extraordinary----\" Tuppence tailed off into silence. Suddenly she aroused herself. \"Tommy!\" \"Yes?\" \"What were they like, the two men you passed?\" Tommy frowned in an effort at remembrance. \"One was a big fat sort of chap. Clean shaven, I think--and dark.\" \"That's him,\" cried Tuppence, in an ungrammatical squeal. \"That's Whittington! What was the other man like?\" \"I can't remember. I didn't notice him particularly. It was really the outlandish name that caught my attention.\" \"And people say that coincidences don't happen!\" Tuppence tackled her P\u00eache Melba happily. But Tommy had become serious. \"Look here, Tuppence, old girl, what is this going to lead to?\" \"More money,\" replied his companion. \"I know that. You've only got one idea in your head. What I mean is, what about the next step? How are you going to keep the game up?\" \"Oh!\" Tuppence laid down her spoon. \"You're right, Tommy, it is a bit of a poser.\" \"After all, you know, you can't bluff him forever. You're sure to slip up sooner or later. And, anyway, I'm not at all sure that it isn't actionable--blackmail, you know.\" \"Nonsense. Blackmail is saying you'll tell unless you are given money. Now, there's nothing I could tell, because I don't really know anything.\" \"Hm,\" said Tommy doubtfully. \"Well, anyway, what _are_ we going to do? Whittington was in a hurry to get rid of you this morning, but next time he'll want to know something more before he parts with his money. He'll want to know how much _you_ know, and where you got your information from, and a lot of other things that you can't cope with. What are you going to do about it?\" Tuppence frowned severely. \"We must think. Order some Turkish coffee, Tommy. Stimulating to the brain. Oh, dear, what a lot I have eaten!\" \"You have made rather a hog of yourself! So have I for that matter, but I flatter myself that my choice of dishes was more judicious than yours. Two coffees.\" (This was to the waiter.) \"One Turkish, one French.\" Tuppence sipped her coffee with a deeply reflective air, and snubbed Tommy when he spoke to her. \"Be quiet. I'm thinking.\" \"Shades of Pelmanism!\" said Tommy, and relapsed into silence. \"There!\" said Tuppence at last. \"I've got a plan. Obviously what we've got to do is to find out more about it all.\" Tommy applauded. \"Don't jeer. We can only find out through Whittington. We must discover where he lives, what he does--sleuth him, in fact! Now I can't do it, because he knows me, but he only saw you for a minute or two in Lyons'. He's not likely to recognize you. After all, one young man is much like another.\" \"I repudiate that remark utterly. I'm sure my pleasing features and distinguished appearance would single me out from any crowd.\" \"My plan is this,\" Tuppence went on calmly, \"I'll go alone to-morrow. I'll put him off again like I did to-day. It doesn't matter if I don't get any more money at once. Fifty pounds ought to last us a few days.\" \"Or even longer!\" \"You'll hang about outside. When I come out I shan't speak to you in case he's watching. But I'll take up my stand somewhere near, and when he comes out of the building I'll drop a handkerchief or something, and off you go!\" \"Off I go where?\" \"Follow him, of course, silly! What do you think of the idea?\" \"Sort of thing one reads about in books. I somehow feel that in real life one will feel a bit of an ass standing in the street for hours with nothing to do. People will wonder what I'm up to.\" \"Not in the city. Every one's in such a hurry. Probably no one will even notice you at all.\" \"That's the second time you've made that sort of remark. Never mind, I forgive you. Anyway, it will be rather a lark. What are you doing this afternoon?\" \"Well,\" said Tuppence meditatively. \"I _had_ thought of hats! Or perhaps silk stockings! Or perhaps----\" \"Hold hard,\" admonished Tommy. \"There's a limit to fifty pounds! But let's do dinner and a show to-night at all events.\" \"Rather.\" The day passed pleasantly. The evening even more so. Two of the five-pound notes were now irretrievably dead. They met by arrangement the following morning and proceeded citywards. Tommy remained on the opposite side of the road while Tuppence plunged into the building. Tommy strolled slowly down to the end of the street, then back again. Just as he came abreast of the building, Tuppence darted across the road. \"Tommy!\" \"Yes. What's up?\" \"The place is shut. I can't make anyone hear.\" \"That's odd.\" \"Isn't it? Come up with me, and let's try again.\" Tommy followed her. As they passed the third floor landing a young clerk came out of an office. He hesitated a moment, then addressed himself to Tuppence. \"Were you wanting the Esthonia Glassware?\" \"Yes, please.\" \"It's closed down. Since yesterday afternoon. Company being wound up, they say. Not that I've ever heard of it myself. But anyway the office is to let.\" \"Th--thank you,\" faltered Tuppence. \"I suppose you don't know Mr. Whittington's address?\" \"Afraid I don't. They left rather suddenly.\" \"Thank you very much,\" said Tommy. \"Come on, Tuppence.\" They descended to the street again where they gazed at one another blankly. \"That's torn it,\" said Tommy at length. \"And I never \"Cheer up, old thing, it can't be helped.\" \"Can't it, though!\" Tuppence's little chin shot out defiantly. \"Do you think this is the end? If so, you're wrong. It's just"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "She is a heavy, solid person, very limited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be puritanical. You could hardly conceive a less emotional subject. Yet I have told you how, on the first night here, I heard her sobbing bitterly, and since then I have more than once observed traces of tears upon her face. Some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her heart. Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty memory which haunts her, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a domestic tyrant. I have always felt that there was something singular and questionable in this man's character, but the adventure of last night brings all my suspicions to a head. And yet it may seem a small matter in itself. You are aware that I am not a very sound sleeper, and since I have been on guard in this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever. Last night, about two in the morning, I was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room. I rose, opened my door, and peeped out. A long black shadow was trailing down the corridor. It was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his hand. He was in shirt and trousers, with no covering to his feet. I could merely see the outline, but his height told me that it was Barrymore. He walked very slowly and circumspectly, and there was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance. I have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which runs round the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther side. I waited until he had passed out of sight and then I followed him. When I came round the balcony he had reached the end of the farther corridor, and I could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he had entered one of the rooms. Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and unoccupied so that his expedition became more mysterious than ever. The light shone steadily as if he were standing motionless. I crept down the passage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner of the door. Barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the glass. His profile was half turned towards me, and his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor. For some minutes he stood watching intently. Then he gave a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light. Instantly I made my way back to my room, and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing once more upon their return journey. Long afterwards when I had fallen into a light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere in a lock, but I could not tell whence the sound came. What it all means I cannot guess, but there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of. I do not trouble you with my theories, for you asked me to furnish you only with facts. I have had a long talk with Sir Henry this morning, and we have made a plan of campaign founded upon my observations of last night. I will not speak about it just now, but it should make my next report interesting reading. Baskerville Hall, Oct. fifteenth. MY DEAR HOLMES: If I was compelled to leave you without much news during the early days of my mission you must acknowledge that I am making up for lost time, and that events are now crowding thick and fast upon us. In my last report I ended upon my top note with Barrymore at the window, and now I have quite a budget already which will, unless I am much mistaken, considerably surprise you. Things have taken a turn which I could not have anticipated. In some ways they have within the last forty-eight hours become much clearer and in some ways they have become more complicated. But I will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself. Before breakfast on the morning following my adventure I went down the corridor and examined the room in which Barrymore had been on the night before. The western window through which he had stared so intently has, I noticed, one peculiarity above all other windows in the house--it commands the nearest outlook on to the moor. There is an opening between two trees which enables one from this point of view to look right down upon it, while from all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse which can be obtained. It follows, therefore, that Barrymore, since only this window would serve the purpose, must have been looking out for something or somebody upon the moor. The night was very dark, so that I can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone. It had struck me that it was possible that some love intrigue was on foot. That would have accounted for his stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness of his wife. The man is a striking-looking fellow, very well equipped to steal the heart of a country girl, so that this theory seemed to have something to support it. That opening of the door which I had heard after I had returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep some clandestine appointment. So I reasoned with myself in the morning, and I tell you the direction of my suspicions, however much the result may have shown that they were unfounded. But whatever the true explanation of Barrymore's movements might be, I felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself until I could explain them was more than I could bear. I had an interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast, and I told him all that I had seen. He was less surprised than I had expected. \"I knew that Barrymore walked about nights, and I had a mind to speak to him about it,\" said he. \"Two or three times I have heard his steps in the passage, coming and going, just about the hour you name.\" \"Perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular window,\" I suggested. \"Perhaps he does. If so, we should be able to shadow him and see what it is that he is after. I wonder what your friend Holmes would do if he were here.\" \"I believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest,\" said I. \"He would follow Barrymore and see what he did.\" \"Then we shall do it together.\" \"But surely he would hear us.\" \"The man is rather deaf, and in any case we must take our chance of that. We'll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he passes.\" Sir Henry rubbed his hands with pleasure, and it was evident that he hailed the adventure as a relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor. The baronet has been in communication with the architect who prepared the plans for Sir Charles, and with a contractor from London, so that we may expect great changes to begin here soon. There have been decorators and furnishers up from Plymouth, and it is evident that our friend has large ideas and means to spare no pains or expense to restore the grandeur of his family. When the house is renovated and refurnished, all that he will need will be a wife to make it complete. Between ourselves there are pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is willing, for I have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour, Miss Stapleton. And yet the course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as one would under the circumstances expect. Today, for example, its surface was broken by a very unexpected ripple, which has caused our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance. After the conversation which I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir Henry put on his hat and prepared to go out. As a matter of course I did the same. \"What, are you coming, Watson?\" he asked, looking at me in a curious way. \"That depends on"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "I handed him the glass, and he drank it down. \"That's better,\" he said. \"Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or more, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the house. Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared, one of whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had never seen before. This fellow had Drebber by the collar, and when they came to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half across the road. 'You hound,' he cried, shaking his stick at him; 'I'll teach you to insult an honest girl!' He was so hot that I think he would have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur staggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He ran as far as the corner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and jumped in. 'Drive me to Halliday's Private Hotel,' said he. \"When I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that I feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drove along slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I might take him right out into the country, and there in some deserted lane have my last interview with him. I had almost decided upon this, when he solved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him again, and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in, leaving word that I should wait for him. There he remained until closing time, and when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my own hands. \"Don't imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would only have been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself to do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for his life if he chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets which I have filled in America during my wandering life, I was once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day the professor was lecturing on poisions, [twenty-five] and he showed his students some alkaloid, as he called it, which he had extracted from some South American arrow poison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant death. I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and when they were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a fairly good dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble pills, and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison. I determined at the time that when I had my chance, my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I ate the pill that remained. It would be quite as deadly, and a good deal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief. From that day I had always my pill boxes about with me, and the time had now come when I was to use them. \"It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard and raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within--so glad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty long years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would understand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my nerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples throbbing with excitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I see you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on each side of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton Road. \"There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the dripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber all huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, 'It's time to get out,' I said. \"'All right, cabby,' said he. \"I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned, for he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden. I had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little top-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the front room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the daughter were walking in front of us. \"'It's infernally dark,' said he, stamping about. \"'We'll soon have a light,' I said, striking a match and putting it to a wax candle which I had brought with me. 'Now, Enoch Drebber,' I continued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, 'who am I?' \"He gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I saw a horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which showed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and I saw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered in his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the door and laughed loud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be sweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me. \"'You dog!' I said; 'I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St. Petersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your wanderings have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see to-morrow's sun rise.' He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I could see on his face that he thought I was mad. So I was for the time. The pulses in my temples beat like sledge-hammers, and I believe I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me. \"'What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?' I cried, locking the door, and shaking the key in his face. 'Punishment has been slow in coming, but it has overtaken you at last.' I saw his coward lips tremble as I spoke. He would have begged for his life, but he knew well that it was useless. \"'Would you murder me?' he stammered. \"'There is no murder,' I answered. 'Who talks of murdering a mad dog? What mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from her slaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and shameless harem.' \"'It was not I who killed her father,' he cried. \"'But it was you who broke her innocent heart,' I shrieked, thrusting the box before him. 'Let the high God judge between us. Choose and eat. There is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what you leave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are ruled by chance.' \"He cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my knife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I swallowed the other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or more, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die. Shall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the first warning pangs told him that the poison was in his system? I laughed as I saw it, and held Lucy's marriage ring in front of his eyes. Best quality paper. Envelopes at sixpence a packet. Particular man in his stationery. No address. 'Be at the third pillar from the left outside the Lyceum Theatre to-night at seven o'clock. If you are distrustful, bring two friends. You are a wronged woman, and shall have justice. "}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "My mother and I have been surrounded for years with every indulgence everything that would make a display. But we have never had any money, Miss Innes; that must have been why mother rented this house. My stepfather pays our bills. It's the most maddening, humiliating existence in the world. I would love honest poverty better.\" \"Never mind,\" I said; \"when you and Halsey are married you can be as honest as you like, and you will certainly be poor.\" Halsey came to the door at that moment and I could hear him coaxing Liddy for admission to the sick room. \"Shall I bring him in?\" I asked Louise, uncertain what to do. The girl seemed to shrink back among her pillows at the sound of his voice. I was vaguely irritated with her; there are few young fellows like Halsey--straightforward, honest, and willing to sacrifice everything for the one woman. I knew one once, more than thirty years ago, who was like that: he died a long time ago. And sometimes I take out his picture, with its cane and its queer silk hat, and look at it. But of late years it has grown too painful: he is always a boy--and I am an old woman. I would not bring him back if I could. Perhaps it was some such memory that made me call out sharply. \"Come in, Halsey.\" And then I took my sewing and went into the boudoir beyond, to play propriety. I did not try to hear what they said, but every word came through the open door with curious distinctness. Halsey had evidently gone over to the bed and I suppose he kissed her. There was silence for a moment, as if words were superfluous things. \"I have been almost wild, sweetheart,\"--Halsey's voice. \"Why didn't you trust me, and send for me before?\" \"It was because I couldn't trust myself,\" she said in a low tone. \"I am too weak to struggle to-day; oh, Halsey, how I have wanted to see you!\" There was something I did not hear, then Halsey again. \"We could go away,\" he was saying. \"What does it matter about any one in the world but just the two of us? To be always together, like this, hand in hand; Louise--don't tell me it isn't going to be. I won't believe you.\" \"You don't know; you don't know,\" Louise repeated dully. \"Halsey, I care--you know that--but--not enough to marry you.\" \"That is not true, Louise,\" he said sternly. \"You can not look at me with your honest eyes and say that.\" \"I can not marry you,\" she repeated miserably. \"It's bad enough, isn't it? Don't make it worse. Some day, before long, you will be glad.\" \"Then it is because you have never loved me.\" There were depths of hurt pride in his voice. \"You saw how much I loved you, and you let me think you cared--for a while. No--that isn't like you, Louise. There is something you haven't told me. Is it--because there is some one else?\" \"Yes,\" almost inaudibly. \"Louise! Oh, I don't believe it.\" \"It is true,\" she said sadly. \"Halsey, you must not try to see me again. As soon as I can, I am going away from here--where you are all so much kinder than I deserve. And whatever you hear about me, try to think as well of me as you can. I am going to marry--another man. How you must hate me--hate me!\" I could hear Halsey cross the room to the window. Then, after a pause, he went back to her again. I could hardly sit still; I wanted to go in and give her a good shaking. \"Then it's all over,\" he was saying with a long breath. \"The plans we made together, the hopes, the--all of it--over! Well, I'll not be a baby, and I'll give you up the minute you say 'I don't love you and I do love--some one else'!\" \"I can not say that,\" she breathed, \"but, very soon, I shall marry--the other man.\" I could hear Halsey's low triumphant laugh. \"I defy him,\" he said. \"Sweetheart, as long as you care for me, I am not afraid.\" The wind slammed the door between the two rooms just then, and I could hear nothing more, although I moved my chair quite close. After a discreet interval, I went into the other room, and found Louise alone. She was staring with sad eyes at the cherub painted on the ceiling over the bed, and because she looked tired I did not disturb her. We had discovered Louise at the lodge Tuesday night. It was Wednesday I had my interview with her. Thursday and Friday were uneventful, save as they marked improvement in our patient. Gertrude spent almost all the time with her, and the two had grown to be great friends. But certain things hung over me constantly; the coroner's inquest on the death of Arnold Armstrong, to be held Saturday, and the arrival of Mrs. Armstrong and young Doctor Walker, bringing the body of the dead president of the Traders' Bank. We had not told Louise of either death. Then, too, I was anxious about the children. With their mother's inheritance swept away in the wreck of the bank, and with their love affairs in a disastrous condition, things could scarcely be worse. Added to that, the cook and Liddy had a flare-up over the proper way to make beef-tea for Louise, and, of course, the cook left. Mrs. Watson had been glad enough, I think, to turn Louise over to our care, and Thomas went upstairs night and morning to greet his young mistress from the doorway. Poor Thomas! He had the faculty--found still in some old negroes, who cling to the traditions of slavery days--of making his employer's interest his. It was always \"we\" with Thomas; I miss him sorely; pipe-smoking, obsequious, not over reliable, kindly old man! On Thursday Mr. Harton, the Armstrongs' legal adviser, called up from town. He had been advised, he said, that Mrs. Armstrong was coming east with her husband's body and would arrive Monday. He came with some hesitation, he went on, to the fact that he had been further instructed to ask me to relinquish my lease on Sunnyside, as it was Mrs. Armstrong's desire to come directly there. I was aghast. \"Here!\" I said. \"Surely you are mistaken, Mr. Harton. I should think, after--what happened here only a few days ago, she would never wish to come back.\" \"Nevertheless,\" he replied, \"she is most anxious to come. This is what she says. 'Use every possible means to have Sunnyside vacated. Must go there at once.'\" \"Mr. Harton,\" I said testily, \"I am not going to do anything of the kind. I and mine have suffered enough at the hands of this family. I rented the house at an exorbitant figure and I have moved out here for the summer. My city home is dismantled and in the hands of decorators. I have been here one week, during which I have had not a single night of uninterrupted sleep, and I intend to stay until I have recuperated. Moreover, if Mr. Armstrong died insolvent, as I believe was the case, his widow ought to be glad to be rid of so expensive a piece of property.\" The lawyer cleared his throat. \"I am very sorry you have made this decision,\" he said. \"Miss Innes, Mrs. Fitzhugh tells me Louise Armstrong is with you.\" \"She is.\" \"Has she been informed of this--double bereavement?\" \"Not yet,\" I said. \"She has been very ill; perhaps to-night she can be told.\" \"It is very sad; very sad,\" he said. \"I have a telegram for her, Mrs. Innes. Shall I send it out?\" \"Better open it and read it to me,\" I suggested. \"If it is important, that will save time.\" There was a pause while Mr. Harton opened the telegram. Then he read it slowly, judicially. \"'Watch for Nina Carrington. Home Monday. Signed F. L. W.'\"  \"Hum!\" I said. \"'Watch for Nina Carrington. Home Monday.' Very well, Mr. Harton, I will tell her, but she is not in condition to watch for any one.\" \"Well, Miss Innes, if you decide to--er--relinquish the lease, let me know,\" the lawyer said. \"I shall not relinquish it,\" I replied, and I imagined his irritation from the way he hung up the receiver. I wrote the telegram down word for word, afraid to trust my memory, and decided to ask Doctor Stewart how soon Louise might be told the truth. The closing of the Traders' Bank I considered unnecessary for her to know, but the death of her stepfather and stepbrother must be broken to her soon, or she might hear it in some unexpected and shocking manner. Doctor Stewart came about four o'clock, bringing his leather satchel into the house with a great deal of care, and opening it at the foot of the stairs to show me a dozen big yellow eggs nesting among the bottles. \"Real eggs,\" he said proudly. \"None of your anemic store eggs, but the real thing--some of them still warm. Feel them! Egg-nog for Miss Louise.\" He was beaming with satisfaction, and before he left, he insisted on going back to the pantry and making an egg-nog with his own hands. Somehow, all the time he was doing it, I had a vision of Doctor Willoughby, my nerve specialist in the city, trying to make an egg-nog. I wondered if he ever prescribed anything so plebeian--and so delicious. And while Doctor Stewart whisked the eggs he talked. \"I said to Mrs. Stewart,\" he confided, a little red in the face from the exertion, \"after I went home the other day, that you would think me an old gossip, for saying what I did about Walker and Miss Louise.\" \"Nothing of the sort,\" I protested. \"The fact is,\" he went on, evidently justifying him self, \"I got that piece of information just as we get a lot of things, through the kitchen end of the house. Young Walker's chauffeur--Walker's more fashionable than I am, and he goes around the country in a Stanhope car--well, his chauffeur comes to see our servant girl, and he told her the whole thing. I thought it was probable, because Walker spent a lot of time up here last summer, when the family was here, and besides, Riggs, that's Walker's man, had a very pat little story about the doctor's building a house on this property, just at the foot of the hill. The sugar, please.\" The egg-nog was finished. Drop by drop the liquor had cooked the egg, and now, with a final whisk, a last toss in the shaker, it was ready, a symphony in gold and white. The doctor sniffed it. \"Real eggs, real milk, and a touch of real Kentucky whisky,\" he said. He insisted on carrying it up himself, but at the foot of the stairs he paused. \"Riggs said the plans were drawn for the house,\" he said, harking back to the old subject. \"Drawn by Huston in town. So I naturally believed him.\" When the doctor came down, I was ready with a question. \"Doctor,\" I asked, \"is there any one in the neighborhood named Carrington? Nina Carrington?\" \"Carrington?\" He wrinkled his forehead. \"Carrington? No, I don't remember any such family. There used to be Covingtons down the creek.\" \"The name was Carrington,\" I said, and the subject lapsed. Gertrude and Halsey went for a long walk that afternoon, and Louise slept. Time hung heavy on my hands, and I did as I had fallen into a habit of doing lately--I sat down and thought things over. One result of my meditations was that I got up suddenly and went to the telephone. I had taken the most intense dislike to this Doctor Walker, whom I had never seen, and who was being talked of in the countryside as the fiance of Louise Armstrong. I knew Sam Huston well. There had been a time, when Sam was a good deal younger than he is now, before he had married Anne Endicott, when I knew him even better. So now I felt no hesitation in calling him over the telephone. But when his office boy had given way to his confidential clerk, and that functionary had condescended to connect his employer's desk telephone, I was somewhat at a loss as to how to begin. \"Why, how are you, Rachel?\" Sam said sonorously. \"Going to build that house at Rock View?\" It was a twenty-year-old joke of his. \"Sometime, perhaps,\" I said. \"Just now I want to ask you a question about something which is none of my business.\" \"I see you haven't changed an iota in a quarter of a century, Rachel.\" This was intended to be another jest. \"Ask ahead: everything but my domestic affairs is at your service.\" \"Try to be serious,\" I said. \"And tell me this: has your firm made any plans for a house recently, for a Doctor Walker, at Casanova?\" \"Yes, we have.\" \"Where was it to be built? I have a reason for asking.\" \"It was to be, I believe, on the Armstrong place. Mr. Armstrong himself consulted me, and the inference was--in fact, I am quite certain--the house was to be occupied by Mr. Armstrong's daughter, who was engaged to marry Doctor Walker.\" When the architect had inquired for the different members of my family, and had finally rung off, I was certain of one thing. Louise Armstrong was in love with Halsey, and the man she was going to marry was Doctor Walker. Moreover, this decision was not new; marriage had been contemplated for some time. There must certainly be some explanation--but what was it? That day I repeated to Louise the telegram Mr. Warton had opened. She seemed to understand, but an unhappier face I have never seen. She looked like a criminal whose reprieve is over, and the day of execution approaching. The next day, Friday, Gertrude broke the news of her stepfather's death to Louise. She did it as gently as she could, telling her first that he was very ill, and finally that he was dead. Louise received the news in the most unexpected manner, and when Gertrude came out to tell me how she had stood it, I think she was almost shocked. \"She just lay and stared at me, Aunt Ray,\" she said. \"Do you know, I believe she is glad, glad! And she is too honest to pretend anything else. What sort of man was Mr. Paul Armstrong, anyhow?\" \"He was a bully as well as a rascal, Gertrude,\" I said. \"But I am convinced of one thing; Louise will send for Halsey now, and they will make it all up.\" For Louise had steadily refused to see Halsey all that day, and the boy was frantic. We had a quiet hour, Halsey and I, that evening, and I told him several things; about the request that we give up the lease to Sunnyside, about the telegram to Louise, about the rumors of an approaching marriage between the girl and Doctor Walker, and, last of all, my own interview with her the day before. He sat back in a big chair, with his face in the shadow, and my heart fairly ached for him. He was so big and so boyish! When I had finished he drew a long breath. \"Whatever Louise does,\" he said, \"nothing will convince me, Aunt Ray, that she doesn't care for me. And up to two months ago, when she and her mother went west, I was the happiest fellow on earth. Then something made a difference: she wrote me that her people were opposed to the marriage; that her feeling for me was what it had always been, but that something had happened which had changed her ideas as to the future. I was not to write until she wrote me, and whatever occurred, I was to think the best I could of her. It sounded like a puzzle. When I saw her yesterday, it was the same thing, only, perhaps, worse.\" \"Halsey,\" I asked, \"have you any idea of the nature of the interview between Louise Armstrong and Arnold the night he was murdered?\" \"It was stormy. Thomas says once or twice he almost broke into the room, he was so alarmed for Louise.\" \"Another thing, Halsey,\" I said, \"have you ever heard Louise mention a woman named Carrington, Nina Carrington?\" \"Never,\" he said positively. For try as we would, our thoughts always came back to that fatal Saturday night, and the murder. Every conversational path led to it, and we all felt that Jamieson was tightening the threads of evidence around John Bailey. The detective's absence was hardly reassuring; he must have had something to work on in town, or he would have returned. The papers reported that the cashier of the Traders' Bank was ill in his apartments at the Knickerbocker--a condition not surprising, considering everything. The guilt of the defunct president was no longer in doubt; the missing bonds had been advertised and some of them discovered. In every instance they had been used as collateral for large loans, and the belief was current that not less than a million and a half dollars had been realized. Every one connected with the bank had been placed under arrest, and released on heavy bond. Was he alone in his guilt, or was the cashier his accomplice? Where was the money? The estate of the dead man was comparatively small--a city house on a fashionable street, Sunnyside, a large estate largely mortgaged, an insurance of fifty thousand dollars, and some personal property--this was all. The rest lost in speculation probably, the papers said. There was one thing which looked uncomfortable for Jack Bailey: he and Paul Armstrong together had promoted a railroad company in New Mexico, and it was rumored that together they had sunk large sums of money there. The business alliance between the two men added to the belief that Bailey knew something of the looting. His unexplained absence from the bank on Monday lent color to the suspicion against him. The strange thing seemed to be his surrendering himself on the point of departure. To me, it seemed the shrewd calculation of a clever rascal. I was not actively antagonistic to Gertrude's lover, but I meant to be convinced, one way or the other. I took no one on faith. That night the Sunnyside ghost began to walk again. Liddy had been sleeping in Louise's dressing-room on a couch, and the approach of dusk was a signal for her to barricade the entire suite. Situated as its was, beyond the circular staircase, nothing but an extremity of excitement would have made her pass it after dark. I confess myself that the place seemed to me to have a sinister appearance, but we kept that wing well lighted, and until the lights went out at midnight it was really cheerful, if one did not know its history. On Friday night, then, I had gone to bed, resolved to go at once to sleep. Thoughts that insisted on obtruding themselves I pushed resolutely to the back of my mind, and I systematically relaxed every muscle. I fell asleep soon, and was dreaming that Doctor Walker was building his new house immediately in front of my windows: I could hear the thump-thump of the hammers, and then I waked to a knowledge that somebody was pounding on my door. I was up at once, and with the sound of my footstep on the floor the low knocking ceased, to be followed immediately by sibilant whispering through the keyhole. \"Miss Rachel! Miss Rachel!\" somebody was saying, over and over. \"Is that you, Liddy?\" I asked, my hand on the knob. \"For the love of mercy, let me in!\" she said in a low tone. She was leaning against the door, for when I opened it, she fell in. She was greenish-white, and she had a red and black barred flannel petticoat over her shoulders. \"Listen,\" she said, standing in the middle of the floor and holding on to me. \"Oh, Miss Rachel, it's the ghost of that dead man hammering to get in!\" Sure enough, there was a dull thud--thud--thud from some place near. It was muffled: one rather felt than heard it, and it was impossible to locate. One moment it seemed to come, three taps and a pause, from the floor under us: the next, thud--thud--thud--it came apparently from the wall. It seemed a pity to twist it up again, but when I suggested this, cautiously, she said it was troublesome and got in her eyes when it was loose. So she gathered it up, while I held a row of little shell combs and pins, and when it was done"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "\"Yes, I am.\" \"Well, you know what my instructions are. I am sorry to intrude, but you heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not leave you, and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor.\" Sir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile. \"My dear fellow,\" said he, \"Holmes, with all his wisdom, did not foresee some things which have happened since I have been on the moor. You understand me? I am sure that you are the last man in the world who would wish to be a spoil-sport. I must go out alone.\" It put me in a most awkward position. I was at a loss what to say or what to do, and before I had made up my mind he picked up his cane and was gone. But when I came to think the matter over my conscience reproached me bitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of my sight. I imagined what my feelings would be if I had to return to you and to confess that some misfortune had occurred through my disregard for your instructions. I assure you my cheeks flushed at the very thought. It might not even now be too late to overtake him, so I set off at once in the direction of Merripit House. I hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing anything of Sir Henry, until I came to the point where the moor path branches off. There, fearing that perhaps I had come in the wrong direction after all, I mounted a hill from which I could command a view--the same hill which is cut into the dark quarry. Thence I saw him at once. He was on the moor path about a quarter of a mile off, and a lady was by his side who could only be Miss Stapleton. It was clear that there was already an understanding between them and that they had met by appointment. They were walking slowly along in deep conversation, and I saw her making quick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest in what she was saying, while he listened intently, and once or twice shook his head in strong dissent. I stood among the rocks watching them, very much puzzled as to what I should do next. To follow them and break into their intimate conversation seemed to be an outrage, and yet my clear duty was never for an instant to let him out of my sight. To act the spy upon a friend was a hateful task. Still, I could see no better course than to observe him from the hill, and to clear my conscience by confessing to him afterwards what I had done. It is true that if any sudden danger had threatened him I was too far away to be of use, and yet I am sure that you will agree with me that the position was very difficult, and that there was nothing more which I could do. Our friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted on the path and were standing deeply absorbed in their conversation, when I was suddenly aware that I was not the only witness of their interview. A wisp of green floating in the air caught my eye, and another glance showed me that it was carried on a stick by a man who was moving among the broken ground. It was Stapleton with his butterfly-net. He was very much closer to the pair than I was, and he appeared to be moving in their direction. At this instant Sir Henry suddenly drew Miss Stapleton to his side. His arm was round her, but it seemed to me that she was straining away from him with her face averted. He stooped his head to hers, and she raised one hand as if in protest. Next moment I saw them spring apart and turn hurriedly round. Stapleton was the cause of the interruption. He was running wildly towards them, his absurd net dangling behind him. He gesticulated and almost danced with excitement in front of the lovers. What the scene meant I could not imagine, but it seemed to me that Stapleton was abusing Sir Henry, who offered explanations, which became more angry as the other refused to accept them. The lady stood by in haughty silence. Finally Stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in a peremptory way to his sister, who, after an irresolute glance at Sir Henry, walked off by the side of her brother. The naturalist's angry gestures showed that the lady was included in his displeasure. The baronet stood for a minute looking after them, and then he walked slowly back the way that he had come, his head hanging, the very picture of dejection. What all this meant I could not imagine, but I was deeply ashamed to have witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend's knowledge. I ran down the hill therefore and met the baronet at the bottom. His face was flushed with anger and his brows were wrinkled, like one who is at his wit's ends what to do. \"Halloa, Watson! Where have you dropped from?\" said he. \"You don't mean to say that you came after me in spite of all?\" I explained everything to him: how I had found it impossible to remain behind, how I had followed him, and how I had witnessed all that had occurred. For an instant his eyes blazed at me, but my frankness disarmed his anger, and he broke at last into a rather rueful laugh. \"You would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe place for a man to be private,\" said he, \"but, by thunder, the whole countryside seems to have been out to see me do my wooing--and a mighty poor wooing at that! Where had you engaged a seat?\" \"I was on that hill.\" \"Quite in the back row, eh? But her brother was well up to the front. Did you see him come out on us?\" \"Yes, I did.\" \"Did he ever strike you as being crazy--this brother of hers?\" \"I can't say that he ever did.\" \"I dare say not. I always thought him sane enough until today, but you can take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a straitjacket. What's the matter with me, anyhow? You've lived near me for some weeks, Watson. Tell me straight, now! Is there anything that would prevent me from making a good husband to a woman that I loved?\" \"I should say not.\" \"He can't object to my worldly position, so it must be myself that he has this down on. What has he against me? I never hurt man or woman in my life that I know of. And yet he would not so much as let me touch the tips of her fingers.\" \"Did he say so?\" \"That, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I've only known her these few weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was made for me, and she, too--she was happy when she was with me, and that I'll swear. There's a light in a woman's eyes that speaks louder than words. But he has never let us get together and it was only today for the first time that I saw a chance of having a few words with her alone. She was glad to meet me, but when she did it was not love that she would talk about, and she wouldn't have let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it. She kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger, and that she would never be happy until I had left it. I told her that since I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it, and that if she really wanted me to go, the only way to work it was for her to arrange to go with me. With that I offered in as many words to marry her, but before she could answer, down came this brother of hers, running at us with a face on him like a madman. He was just white with rage, and those"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "At one point is a small cross done in red ink, and above it is 'three.three7 from left,' in faded pencil-writing. In the left-hand corner is a curious hieroglyphic like four crosses in a line with their arms touching. Beside it is written, in very rough and coarse characters, 'The sign of the four,--Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, Dost Akbar.' No, I confess that I do not see how this bears upon the matter. Yet it is evidently a document of importance. It has been kept carefully in a pocket-book; for the one side is as clean as the other.\" \"It was in his pocket-book that we found it.\" \"Preserve it carefully, then, Miss Morstan, for it may prove to be of use to us. I begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much deeper and more subtle than I at first supposed. I must reconsider my ideas.\" He leaned back in the cab, and I could see by his drawn brow and his vacant eye that he was thinking intently. Miss Morstan and I chatted in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible outcome, but our companion maintained his impenetrable reserve until the end of our journey. It was a September evening, and not yet seven o'clock, but the day had been a dreary one, and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city. Mud-colored clouds drooped sadly over the muddy streets. Down the Strand the lamps were but misty splotches of diffused light which threw a feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement. The yellow glare from the shop-windows streamed out into the steamy, vaporous air, and threw a murky, shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare. There was, to my mind, something eerie and ghost-like in the endless procession of faces which flitted across these narrow bars of light,--sad faces and glad, haggard and merry. Like all human kind, they flitted from the gloom into the light, and so back into the gloom once more. I am not subject to impressions, but the dull, heavy evening, with the strange business upon which we were engaged, combined to make me nervous and depressed. I could see from Miss Morstan's manner that she was suffering from the same feeling. Holmes alone could rise superior to petty influences. He held his open note-book upon his knee, and from time to time he jotted down figures and memoranda in the light of his pocket-lantern. At the Lyceum Theatre the crowds were already thick at the side-entrances. In front a continuous stream of hansoms and four-wheelers were rattling up, discharging their cargoes of shirt-fronted men and beshawled, bediamonded women. We had hardly reached the third pillar, which was our rendezvous, before a small, dark, brisk man in the dress of a coachman accosted us. \"Are you the parties who come with Miss Morstan?\" he asked. \"I am Miss Morstan, and these two gentlemen are my friends,\" said she. He bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and questioning eyes upon us. \"You will excuse me, miss,\" he said with a certain dogged manner, \"but I was to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companions is a police-officer.\" \"I give you my word on that,\" she answered. He gave a shrill whistle, on which a street Arab led across a four-wheeler and opened the door. The man who had addressed us mounted to the box, while we took our places inside. We had hardly done so before the driver whipped up his horse, and we plunged away at a furious pace through the foggy streets. The situation was a curious one. We were driving to an unknown place, on an unknown errand. Yet our invitation was either a complete hoax,--which was an inconceivable hypothesis,--or else we had good reason to think that important issues might hang upon our journey. Miss Morstan's demeanor was as resolute and collected as ever. I endeavored to cheer and amuse her by reminiscences of my adventures in Afghanistan; but, to tell the truth, I was myself so excited at our situation and so curious as to our destination that my stories were slightly involved. To this day she declares that I told her one moving anecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead of night, and how I fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at it. At first I had some idea as to the direction in which we were driving; but soon, what with our pace, the fog, and my own limited knowledge of London, I lost my bearings, and knew nothing, save that we seemed to be going a very long way. Sherlock Holmes was never at fault, however, and he muttered the names as the cab rattled through squares and in and out by tortuous by-streets. \"Rochester Row,\" said he. \"Now Vincent Square. Now we come out on the Vauxhall Bridge Road. We are making for the Surrey side, apparently. Yes, I thought so. Now we are on the bridge. You can catch glimpses of the river.\" We did indeed get a fleeting view of a stretch of the Thames with the lamps shining upon the broad, silent water; but our cab dashed on, and was soon involved in a labyrinth of streets upon the other side. \"Wordsworth Road,\" said my companion. \"Priory Road. Lark Hall Lane. Stockwell Place. Robert Street. Cold Harbor Lane. Our quest does not appear to take us to very fashionable regions.\" We had, indeed, reached a questionable and forbidding neighborhood. Long lines of dull brick houses were only relieved by the coarse glare and tawdry brilliancy of public houses at the corner. Then came rows of two-storied villas each with a fronting of miniature garden, and then again interminable lines of new staring brick buildings,--the monster tentacles which the giant city was throwing out into the country. At last the cab drew up at the third house in a new terrace. None of the other houses were inhabited, and that at which we stopped was as dark as its neighbors, save for a single glimmer in the kitchen window. On our knocking, however, the door was instantly thrown open by a Hindoo servant clad in a yellow turban, white loose-fitting clothes, and a yellow sash. There was something strangely incongruous in this Oriental figure framed in the commonplace door-way of a third-rate suburban dwelling-house. \"The Sahib awaits you,\" said he, and even as he spoke there came a high piping voice from some inner room. \"Show them in to me, khitmutgar,\" it cried. \"Show them straight in to me.\" We followed the Indian down a sordid and common passage, ill lit and worse furnished, until he came to a door upon the right, which he threw open. A blaze of yellow light streamed out upon us, and in the centre of the glare there stood a small man with a very high head, a bristle of red hair all round the fringe of it, and a bald, shining scalp which shot out from among it like a mountain-peak from fir-trees. He writhed his hands together as he stood, and his features were in a perpetual jerk, now smiling, now scowling, but never for an instant in repose. Nature had given him a pendulous lip, and a too visible line of yellow and irregular teeth, which he strove feebly to conceal by constantly passing his hand over the lower part of his face. In spite of his obtrusive baldness, he gave the impression of youth. In point of fact he had just turned his thirtieth year. \"Your servant, Miss Morstan,\" he kept repeating, in a thin, high voice. \"Your servant, gentlemen. Pray step into my little sanctum. A small place, miss, but furnished to my own liking. An oasis of art in the howling desert of South London.\" We were all astonished by the appearance of the apartment into which he invited us. In that sorry house it looked as out of place as a diamond of the first water in a setting of brass. The richest and glossiest of curtains and tapestries draped the walls, looped back here and there to expose some richly-mounted painting or Oriental vase. The carpet was of amber-and-black, so soft and so thick that the foot sank pleasantly into it, as into a bed of moss. Two great tiger-skins"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "\"The beginning of what?\" \"Of our adventure! Tommy, don't you see, if they are scared enough to run away like this, it shows that there must be a lot in this Jane Finn business! Well, we'll get to the bottom of it. We'll run them down! We'll be sleuths in earnest!\" \"Yes, but there's no one left to sleuth.\" \"No, that's why we'll have to start all over again. Lend me that bit of pencil. Thanks. Wait a minute--don't interrupt. There!\" Tuppence handed back the pencil, and surveyed the piece of paper on which she had written with a satisfied eye: \"What's that?\" \"Advertisement.\" \"You're not going to put that thing in after all?\" \"No, it's a different one.\" She handed him the slip of paper. Tommy read the words on it aloud: \"WANTED, any information respecting Jane Finn. Apply Y. A.\" THE next day passed slowly. It was necessary to curtail expenditure. Carefully husbanded, forty pounds will last a long time. Luckily the weather was fine, and \"walking is cheap,\" dictated Tuppence. An outlying picture house provided them with recreation for the evening. The day of disillusionment had been a Wednesday. On Thursday the advertisement had duly appeared. On Friday letters might be expected to arrive at Tommy's rooms. He had been bound by an honourable promise not to open any such letters if they did arrive, but to repair to the National Gallery, where his colleague would meet him at ten o'clock. Tuppence was first at the rendezvous. She ensconced herself on a red velvet seat, and gazed at the Turners with unseeing eyes until she saw the familiar figure enter the room. \"Well?\" \"Well,\" returned Mr. Beresford provokingly. \"Which is your favourite picture?\" \"Don't be a wretch. Aren't there _any_ answers?\" Tommy shook his head with a deep and somewhat overacted melancholy. \"I didn't want to disappoint you, old thing, by telling you right off. It's too bad. Good money wasted.\" He sighed. \"Still, there it is. The advertisement has appeared, and--there are only two answers!\" \"Tommy, you devil!\" almost screamed Tuppence. \"Give them to me. How could you be so mean!\" \"Your language, Tuppence, your language! They're very particular at the National Gallery. Government show, you know. And do remember, as I have pointed out to you before, that as a clergyman's daughter----\" \"I ought to be on the stage!\" finished Tuppence with a snap. \"That is not what I intended to say. But if you are sure that you have enjoyed to the full the reaction of joy after despair with which I have kindly provided you free of charge, let us get down to our mail, as the saying goes.\" Tuppence snatched the two precious envelopes from him unceremoniously, and scrutinized them carefully. \"Thick paper, this one. It looks rich. We'll keep it to the last and open the other first.\" \"Right you are. One, two, three, go!\" Tuppence's little thumb ripped open the envelope, and she extracted the contents. \"DEAR SIR, \"Referring to your advertisement in this morning's paper, I may be able to be of some use to you. Perhaps you could call and see me at the above address at eleven o'clock to-morrow morning. \"Yours truly, \"A. CARTER.\" \"27 Carshalton Gardens,\" said Tuppence, referring to the address. \"That's Gloucester Road way. Plenty of time to get there if we tube.\" \"The following,\" said Tommy, \"is the plan of campaign. It is my turn to assume the offensive. Ushered into the presence of Mr. Carter, he and I wish each other good morning as is customary. He then says: \u2018Please take a seat, Mr.--er?' To which I reply promptly and significantly: \u2018Edward Whittington!' whereupon Mr. Carter turns purple in the face and gasps out: \u2018How much?' Pocketing the usual fee of fifty pounds, I rejoin you in the road outside, and we proceed to the next address and repeat the performance.\" \"Don't be absurd, Tommy. Now for the other letter. Oh, this is from the _Ritz!_\" \"A hundred pounds instead of fifty!\" \"I'll read it: \"DEAR SIR, \"Re your advertisement, I should be glad if you would call round somewhere about lunch-time. \"Yours truly, \"JULIUS P. HERSHEIMMER.\" \"Ha!\" said Tommy. \"Do I smell a Boche? Or only an American millionaire of unfortunate ancestry? At all events we'll call at lunch-time. It's a good time--frequently leads to free food for two.\" Tuppence nodded assent. \"Now for Carter. We'll have to hurry.\" Carshalton Terrace proved to be an unimpeachable row of what Tuppence called \"ladylike looking houses.\" They rang the bell at No. 27, and a neat maid answered the door. She looked so respectable that Tuppence's heart sank. Upon Tommy's request for Mr. Carter, she showed them into a small study on the ground floor where she left them. Hardly a minute elapsed, however, before the door opened, and a tall man with a lean hawklike face and a tired manner entered the room. \"Mr. Y. A.?\" he said, and smiled. His smile was distinctly attractive. \"Do sit down, both of you.\" They obeyed. He himself took a chair opposite to Tuppence and smiled at her encouragingly. There was something in the quality of his smile that made the girl's usual readiness desert her. As he did not seem inclined to open the conversation, Tuppence was forced to begin. \"We wanted to know--that is, would you be so kind as to tell us anything you know about Jane Finn?\" \"Jane Finn? Ah!\" Mr. Carter appeared to reflect. \"Well, the question is, what do _you_ know about her?\" Tuppence drew herself up. \"I don't see that that's got anything to do with it.\" \"No? But it has, you know, really it has.\" He smiled again in his tired way, and continued reflectively. \"So that brings us down to it again. What do _you_ know about Jane Finn? \"Come now,\" he continued, as Tuppence remained silent. \"You must know _something_ to have advertised as you did?\" He leaned forward a little, his weary voice held a hint of persuasiveness. \"Suppose you tell me....\" There was something very magnetic about Mr. Carter's personality. Tuppence seemed to shake herself free of it with an effort, as she said: \"We couldn't do that, could we, Tommy?\" But to her surprise, her companion did not back her up. His eyes were fixed on Mr. Carter, and his tone when he spoke held an unusual note of deference. \"I dare say the little we know won't be any good to you, sir. But such as it is, you're welcome to it.\" \"Tommy!\" cried out Tuppence in surprise. Mr. Carter slewed round in his chair. His eyes asked a question. Tommy nodded. \"Yes, sir, I recognized you at once. Saw you in France when I was with the Intelligence. As soon as you came into the room, I knew----\" Mr. Carter held up his hand. \"No names, please. I'm known as Mr. Carter here. It's my cousin's house, by the way. She's willing to lend it to me sometimes when it's a case of working on strictly unofficial lines. Well, now\"--he looked from one to the other--\"who's going to tell me the story?\" \"Fire ahead, Tuppence,\" directed Tommy. \"It's your yarn.\" \"Yes, little lady, out with it.\" And obediently Tuppence did out with it, telling the whole story from the forming of the Young Adventurers, Ltd., downwards. Mr. Carter listened in silence with a resumption of his tired manner. Now and then he passed his hand across his lips as though to hide a smile. When she had finished he nodded gravely. \"Not much. But suggestive. Quite suggestive. If you'll excuse my saying so, you're a curious young couple. I don't know--you might succeed where others have failed ... I believe in luck, you know--always have....\" He paused a moment, and then went on. \"Well, how about it? You're out for adventure. How would you like to work for me? All quite unofficial, you know. Expenses paid, and a moderate screw?\" Tuppence gazed at him, her lips parted, her eyes growing wider and wider. \"What should we have to do?\" she breathed. Mr. Carter smiled. \"Just go on with what you're doing now. _Find Jane Finn_.\" \"Yes, but--who _is_ Jane Finn?\" Mr. Carter nodded gravely. \"Yes, you're entitled to know that, I think.\" He leaned back in his chair, crossed his legs, brought the tips of his fingers together, and began in a low monotone: \"Secret diplomacy (which, by the way, is nearly always bad policy!) does not concern you. It will be sufficient to say that in the early days of 1915 a certain document came into being. It was the draft of a secret agreement--treaty--call it what you like. It was drawn up ready for signature by the various representatives, and drawn up in America--at that time a neutral country. It was dispatched to England by a special messenger selected for that purpose, a young fellow called Danvers. It was hoped that the whole affair had been kept so secret that nothing would have leaked out. That kind of hope is usually disappointed. Somebody always talks! \"Danvers sailed for England on the _Lusitania_. He carried the precious papers in an oilskin packet which he wore next his skin. It was on that particular voyage that the _Lusitania_ was torpedoed and sunk. Danvers was among the list of those missing. Eventually his body was washed ashore, and identified beyond any possible doubt. But the oilskin packet was missing! \"The question was, had it been taken from him, or had he himself passed it on into another's keeping? There were a few incidents that strengthened the possibility of the latter theory. After the torpedo struck the ship, in the few moments during the launching of the boats, Danvers was seen speaking to a young American girl. No one actually saw him pass anything to her, but he might have done so. It seems to me quite likely that he entrusted the papers to this girl, believing that she, as a woman, had a greater chance of bringing them safely to shore. \"But if so, where was the girl, and what had she done with the papers? By later advice from America it seemed likely that Danvers had been closely shadowed on the way over. Was this girl in league with his enemies? Or had she, in her turn, been shadowed and either tricked or forced into handing over the precious packet? \"We set to work to trace her out. It proved unexpectedly difficult. Her name was Jane Finn, and it duly appeared among the list of the survivors, but the girl herself seemed to have vanished completely. Inquiries into her antecedents did little to help us. She was an orphan, and had been what we should call over here a pupil teacher in a small school out West. Her passport had been made out for Paris, where she was going to join the staff of a hospital. She had offered her services voluntarily, and after some correspondence they had been accepted. Having seen her name in the list of the saved from the _Lusitania_, the staff of the hospital were naturally very surprised at her not arriving to take up her billet, and at not hearing from her in any way. \"Well, every effort was made to trace the young lady--but all in vain. We tracked her across Ireland, but nothing could be heard of her after she set foot in England. No use was made of the draft treaty--as might very easily have been done--and we therefore came to the conclusion that Danvers had, after all, destroyed it. The war entered on another phase, the diplomatic aspect changed accordingly, and the treaty was never redrafted. Rumours as to its existence were emphatically denied. The disappearance of Jane Finn was forgotten and the whole affair was lost in oblivion.\" Mr. Carter paused, and Tuppence broke in impatiently: \"But why has it all cropped up again? The war's over.\" A hint of alertness came into Mr. Carter's manner. \"Because it seems that the papers were not destroyed after all, and that they might be resurrected to-day with a new and deadly significance.\" Tuppence stared. Mr. Carter nodded. \"Yes, five years ago, that draft treaty was a weapon in our hands; to-day it is a weapon against us. It was a gigantic blunder. If its terms were made public, it would mean disaster.... It might possibly bring about another war--not with Germany this time! That is an extreme possibility, and I do not believe in its likelihood myself, but that document undoubtedly implicates a number of our statesmen whom we cannot afford to have discredited in any way at the present moment. As a party cry for Labour it would be irresistible, and a Labour Government at this juncture would, in my opinion, be a grave disability for British trade, but that is a mere nothing to the _real_ danger.\" He paused, and then said quietly: \"You may perhaps have heard or read that there is Bolshevist influence at work behind the present Labour unrest?\" Tuppence nodded. \"That is the truth. Bolshevist gold is pouring into this country for the specific purpose of procuring a Revolution. And there is a certain man, a man whose real name is unknown to us, who is working in the dark for his own ends. The Bolshevists are behind the Labour unrest--but this man is _behind the Bolshevists_. Who is he? We do not know. He is always spoken of by the unassuming title of \u2018Mr. Brown.' But one thing is certain, he is the master criminal of this age. He controls a marvellous organization. Most of the Peace propaganda during the war was originated and financed by him. His spies are everywhere.\" \"A naturalized German?\" asked Tommy. \"On the contrary, I have every reason to believe he is an Englishman. He was pro-German, as he would have been pro-Boer. What he seeks to attain we do not know--probably supreme power for himself, of a kind unique in history. We have no clue as to his real personality. It is reported that even his own followers are ignorant of it. Where we have come across his tracks, he has always played a secondary part. Somebody else assumes the chief r\u00f4le. But afterwards we always find that there has been some nonentity, a servant or a clerk, who has remained in the background unnoticed, and that the elusive Mr. Brown has escaped us once more.\" \"Oh!\" Tuppence jumped. \"I wonder----\" \"Yes?\" \"I remember in Mr. Whittington's office. The clerk--he called him Brown. You don't think----\" Carter nodded thoughtfully. \"Very likely. A curious point is that the name is usually mentioned. An idiosyncrasy of genius. Can you describe him at all?\" \"I really didn't notice. He was quite ordinary--just like anyone else.\" Mr. Carter sighed in his tired manner. \"That is the invariable description of Mr. Brown! Brought a telephone message to the man Whittington, did he? Notice a telephone in the outer office?\" Tuppence thought. \"No, I don't think I did.\" \"Exactly. That \u2018message' was Mr. Brown's way of giving an order to his subordinate. He overheard the whole conversation of course. Was it after that that Whittington handed you over the money, and told you to come the following day?\" Tuppence nodded. \"Yes, undoubtedly the hand of Mr. Brown!\" Mr. Carter paused. \"Well, there it is, you see what you are pitting yourselves against? Possibly the finest criminal brain of the age. I don't quite like it, you know. You're such young things, both of you. I shouldn't like anything to happen to you.\" \"It won't,\" Tuppence assured him positively. \"I'll look after her, sir,\" said Tommy. \"And _I_\u2018ll look after _you_,\" retorted Tuppence, resenting the manly assertion. \"Well, then, look after each other,\" said Mr. Carter, smiling. \"Now let's get back to business. There's something mysterious about this draft treaty that we haven't fathomed yet. We've been threatened with it--in plain and unmistakable terms. The Revolutionary element as good as declare that it's in their hands, and that they intend to produce it at a given moment. On the other hand, they are clearly at fault about many of its provisions. The Government consider it as mere bluff on their part, and, rightly or wrongly, have stuck to the policy of absolute denial. I'm not so sure. There have been hints, indiscreet allusions, that seem to indicate that the menace is a real one. The position is much as though they had got hold of an incriminating document, but couldn't read it because it was in cipher--but we know that the draft treaty wasn't in cipher--couldn't be in the nature of things--so that won't wash. But there's _something_. Of course, Jane Finn may be dead for all we know--but I don't think so. The curious thing is that _they're trying to get information about the girl from us_.\" \"What?\" \"Yes. One or two little things have cropped up. And your story, little lady, confirms my idea. They know we're looking for Jane Finn. Well, they'll produce a Jane Finn of their own--say at a _pensionnat_ in Paris.\" Tuppence gasped, and Mr. Carter smiled. \"No one knows in the least what she looks like, so that's all right. She's primed with a trumped-up tale, and her real business is to get as much information as possible out of us. See the idea?\" \"Then you think\"--Tuppence paused to grasp the supposition fully--\"that it _was_ as Jane Finn that they wanted me to go to Paris?\" Mr. Carter smiled more wearily than ever. \"I believe in coincidences, you know,\" he said. \"WELL,\" said Tuppence, recovering herself, \"it really seems as though it were meant to be.\" Carter nodded. \"I know what you mean. I'm superstitious myself. Luck, and all that sort of thing. Fate seems to have chosen you out to be mixed up in this.\" Tommy indulged in a chuckle. \"My word! I don't wonder Whittington got the wind up when Tuppence plumped out that name! I should have myself. But look here, sir, we're taking up an awful lot of your time. Have you any tips to give us before we clear out?\" \"I think not. My experts, working in stereotyped ways, have failed. You will bring imagination and an open mind to the task. Don't be discouraged if that too does not succeed. For one thing there is a likelihood of the pace being forced.\" Tuppence frowned uncomprehendingly. \"When you had that interview with Whittington, they had time before them. I have information that the big _coup_ was planned for early in the new year. But the Government is contemplating legislative action which will deal effectually with the strike menace. They'll get wind of it soon, if they haven't already, and it's possible that that may bring things to a head. I hope it will myself. The less time they have to mature their plans the better. I'm just warning you that you haven't much time before you, and that you needn't be cast down if you fail. It's not an easy proposition anyway. That's all.\" Tuppence rose. \"I think we ought to be businesslike. What exactly can we count upon you for, Mr. Carter?\" Mr. Carter's lips twitched slightly, but he replied succinctly: \"Funds within reason, detailed information on any point, and _no official recognition_. I mean that if you get yourselves into trouble with the police, I can't officially help you out of it. You're on your own.\" Tuppence nodded sagely. \"I quite understand that. I'll write out a list of the things I want to know when I've had time to think. Now--about money----\" \"Yes, Miss Tuppence. Do you want to say how much?\" \"Not exactly. We've got plenty to go with for the present, but when we want more----\" \"It will be waiting for you.\" \"Yes, but--I'm sure I don't want to be rude about the Government if you've got anything to do with it, but you know one really has the devil of a time getting anything out of it! And if we have to fill up a blue form and send it in, and then, after three months, they send us a green one, and so on--well, that won't be much use, will it?\" Mr. Carter laughed outright. \"Don't worry, Miss Tuppence. You will send a personal demand to me here, and the money, in notes, shall be sent by return of post. As to salary, shall we say at the rate of three hundred a year? And an equal sum for Mr. Beresford, of course.\" Tuppence beamed upon him. \"How lovely. You are kind. I do love money! I'll keep beautiful accounts of our expenses all debit and credit, and the balance on the right side, and I really know how to do it when I think.\" \"I'm sure you do. Well, good-bye, and good luck to you both.\" He shook hands with them, and in another minute they"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "\"Tommy! Tell me at once, who is \u2018Mr. Carter'?\" Tommy murmured a name in her ear. \"Oh!\" said Tuppence, impressed. \"And I can tell you, old bean, he's IT!\" \"Oh!\" said Tuppence again. Then she added reflectively, \"I like him, don't you? He looks so awfully tired and bored, and yet you feel that underneath he's just like steel, all keen and flashing. Oh!\" She gave a skip. \"Pinch me, Tommy, do pinch me. I can't believe it's real!\" Mr. Beresford obliged. \"Ow! That's enough! Yes, we're not dreaming. We've got a job!\" \"And what a job! The joint venture has really begun.\" \"It's more respectable than I thought it would be,\" said Tuppence thoughtfully. \"Luckily I haven't got your craving for crime! What time is it? Let's have lunch--oh!\" The same thought sprang to the minds of each. Tommy voiced it first. \"Julius P. Hersheimmer!\" \"We never told Mr. Carter about hearing from him.\" \"Well, there wasn't much to tell--not till we've seen him. Come on, we'd better take a taxi.\" \"Now who's being extravagant?\" \"All expenses paid, remember. Hop in.\" \"At any rate, we shall make a better effect arriving this way,\" said Tuppence, leaning back luxuriously. \"I'm sure blackmailers never arrive in buses!\" \"We've ceased being blackmailers,\" Tommy pointed out. \"I'm not sure I have,\" said Tuppence darkly. On inquiring for Mr. Hersheimmer, they were at once taken up to his suite. An impatient voice cried \"Come in\" in answer to the page-boy's knock, and the lad stood aside to let them pass in. Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer was a great deal younger than either Tommy or Tuppence had pictured him. The girl put him down as thirty-five. He was of middle height, and squarely built to match his jaw. His face was pugnacious but pleasant. No one could have mistaken him for anything but an American, though he spoke with very little accent. \"Get my note? Sit down and tell me right away all you know about my cousin.\" \"Your cousin?\" \"Sure thing. Jane Finn.\" \"Is she your cousin?\" \"My father and her mother were brother and sister,\" explained Mr. Hersheimmer meticulously. \"Oh!\" cried Tuppence. \"Then you know where she is?\" \"No!\" Mr. Hersheimmer brought down his fist with a bang on the table. \"I'm darned if I do! Don't you?\" \"We advertised to receive information, not to give it,\" said Tuppence severely. \"I guess I know that. I can read. But I thought maybe it was her back history you were after, and that you'd know where she was now?\" \"Well, we wouldn't mind hearing her back history,\" said Tuppence guardedly. But Mr. Hersheimmer seemed to grow suddenly suspicious. \"See here,\" he declared. \"This isn't Sicily! No demanding ransom or threatening to crop her ears if I refuse. These are the British Isles, so quit the funny business, or I'll just sing out for that beautiful big British policeman I see out there in Piccadilly.\" Tommy hastened to explain. \"We haven't kidnapped your cousin. On the contrary, we're trying to find her. We're employed to do so.\" Mr. Hersheimmer leant back in his chair. \"Put me wise,\" he said succinctly. Tommy fell in with this demand in so far as he gave him a guarded version of the disappearance of Jane Finn, and of the possibility of her having been mixed up unawares in \"some political show.\" He alluded to Tuppence and himself as \"private inquiry agents\" commissioned to find her, and added that they would therefore be glad of any details Mr. Hersheimmer could give them. That gentleman nodded approval. \"I guess that's all right. I was just a mite hasty. But London gets my goat! I only know little old New York. Just trot out your questions and I'll answer.\" For the moment this paralysed the Young Adventurers, but Tuppence, recovering herself, plunged boldly into the breach with a reminiscence culled from detective fiction. \"When did you last see the dece--your cousin, I mean?\" \"Never seen her,\" responded Mr. Hersheimmer. \"What?\" demanded Tommy, astonished. Hersheimmer turned to him. \"No, sir. As I said before, my father and her mother were brother and sister, just as you might be\"--Tommy did not correct this view of their relationship--\"but they didn't always get on together. And when my aunt made up her mind to marry Amos Finn, who was a poor school teacher out West, my father was just mad! Said if he made his pile, as he seemed in a fair way to do, she'd never see a cent of it. Well, the upshot was that Aunt Jane went out West and we never heard from her again. \"The old man _did_ pile it up. He went into oil, and he went into steel, and he played a bit with railroads, and I can tell you he made Wall Street sit up!\" He paused. \"Then he died--last fall--and I got the dollars. Well, would you believe it, my conscience got busy! Kept knocking me up and saying: What about your Aunt Jane, way out West? It worried me some. You see, I figured it out that Amos Finn would never make good. He wasn't the sort. End of it was, I hired a man to hunt her down. Result, she was dead, and Amos Finn was dead, but they'd left a daughter--Jane--who'd been torpedoed in the _Lusitania_ on her way to Paris. She was saved all right, but they didn't seem able to hear of her over this side. I guessed they weren't hustling any, so I thought I'd come along over, and speed things up. I phoned Scotland Yard and the Admiralty first thing. The Admiralty rather choked me off, but Scotland Yard were very civil--said they would make inquiries, even sent a man round this morning to get her photograph. I'm off to Paris to-morrow, just to see what the Prefecture is doing. I guess if I go to and fro hustling them, they ought to get busy!\" The energy of Mr. Hersheimmer was tremendous. They bowed before it. \"But say now,\" he ended, \"you're not after her for anything? Contempt of court, or something British? A proud-spirited young American girl might find your rules and regulations in war time rather irksome, and get up against it. If that's the case, and there's such a thing as graft in this country, I'll buy her off.\" Tuppence reassured him. \"That's good. Then we can work together. What about some lunch? Shall we have it up here, or go down to the restaurant?\" Tuppence expressed a preference for the latter, and Julius bowed to her decision. Oysters had just given place to Sole Colbert when a card was brought to Hersheimmer. \"Inspector Japp, C.I.D. Scotland Yard again. Another man this time. What does he expect I can tell him that I didn't tell the first chap? I hope they haven't lost that photograph. That Western photographer's place was burned down and all his negatives destroyed--this is the only copy in existence. I got it from the principal of the college there.\" An unformulated dread swept over Tuppence. \"You--you don't know the name of the man who came this morning?\" \"Yes, I do. No, I don't. Half a second. It was on his card. Oh, I know! Inspector Brown. Quiet, unassuming sort of chap.\" A veil might with profit be drawn over the events of the next half-hour. Suffice it to say that no such person as \"Inspector Brown\" was known to Scotland Yard. The photograph of Jane Finn, which would have been of the utmost value to the police in tracing her, was lost beyond recovery. Once again \"Mr. Brown\" had triumphed. The immediate result of this set-back was to effect a _rapprochement_ between Julius Hersheimmer and the Young Adventurers. All barriers went down with a crash, and Tommy and Tuppence felt they had known the young American all their lives. They abandoned the discreet reticence of \"private inquiry agents,\" and revealed to him the whole history of the joint venture, whereat the young man declared himself \"tickled to death.\" He turned to Tuppence at the close of the narration. \"I've always had a kind of idea that English girls were just a mite moss-grown. Old-fashioned and sweet, you know, but scared to move round without a footman or a maiden aunt. I guess I'm a bit behind the times!\" The upshot of these confidential relations was that Tommy and Tuppence took up their abode forthwith at the _Ritz_, in order, as Tuppence put it, to keep in touch with Jane Finn's only living relation. \"And put like that,\" she added confidentially to Tommy, \"nobody could boggle at the expense!\" Nobody did, which was the great thing. \"And now,\" said the young lady on the morning after their installation, \"to work!\" Mr. Beresford put down the _Daily Mail_, which he was reading, and applauded with somewhat unnecessary vigour. He was politely requested by his colleague not to be an ass. \"Dash it all, Tommy, we've got to _do_ something for our money.\" Tommy sighed. \"Yes, I fear even the dear old Government will not support us at the _Ritz_ in idleness for ever.\" \"Therefore, as I said before, we must _do_ something.\" \"Well,\" said Tommy, picking up the _Daily Mail_ again, \"_do_ it. I shan't stop you.\" \"You see,\" continued Tuppence. \"I've been thinking----\" She was interrupted by a fresh bout of applause. \"It's all very well for you to sit there being funny, Tommy. It would do you no harm to do a little brain work too.\" \"My union, Tuppence, my union! It does not permit me to work before 11 a.m.\" \"Tommy, do you want something thrown at you? It is absolutely essential that we should without delay map out a plan of campaign.\" \"Hear, hear!\" \"Well, let's do it.\" Tommy laid his paper finally aside. \"There's something of the simplicity of the truly great mind about you, Tuppence. Fire ahead. I'm listening.\" \"To begin with,\" said Tuppence, \"what have we to go upon?\" \"Absolutely nothing,\" said Tommy cheerily. \"Wrong!\" Tuppence wagged an energetic finger. \"We have two distinct clues.\" \"What are they?\" \"First clue, we know one of the gang.\" \"Whittington?\" \"Yes. I'd recognize him anywhere.\" \"Hum,\" said Tommy doubtfully, \"I don't call that much of a clue. You don't know where to look for him, and it's about a thousand to one against your running against him by accident.\" \"I'm not so sure about that,\" replied Tuppence thoughtfully. \"I've often noticed that once coincidences start happening they go on happening in the most extraordinary way. I dare say it's some natural law that we haven't found out. Still, as you say, we can't rely on that. But there _are_ places in London where simply every one is bound to turn up sooner or later. Piccadilly Circus, for instance. One of my ideas was to take up my stand there every day with a tray of flags.\" \"What about meals?\" inquired the practical Tommy. \"How like a man! What does mere food matter?\" \"That's all very well. You've just had a thundering good breakfast. No one's got a better appetite than you have, Tuppence, and by tea-time you'd be eating the flags, pins and all. But, honestly, I don't think much of the idea. Whittington mayn't be in London at all.\" \"That's true. Anyway, I think clue No. 2 is more promising.\" \"Let's hear it.\" \"It's nothing much. Only a Christian name--Rita. Whittington mentioned it that day.\" \"Are you proposing a third advertisement: Wanted, female crook, answering to the name of Rita?\" \"I am not. I propose to reason in a logical manner. That man, Danvers, was shadowed on the way over, wasn't he? And it's more likely to have been a woman than a man----\" \"I don't see that at all.\" \"I am absolutely certain that it would be a woman, and a good-looking one,\" replied Tuppence calmly. \"On these technical points I bow to your decision,\" murmured Mr. Beresford. \"Now, obviously this woman, whoever she was, was saved.\" \"How do you make that out?\" \"If she wasn't, how would they have known Jane Finn had got the papers?\" \"Correct. Proceed, O Sherlock!\" \"Now there's just a chance, I admit it's only a chance, that this woman may have been \u2018Rita.'\" \"And if so?\" \"If so, we've got to hunt through the survivors of the _Lusitania_ till we find her.\" \"Then the first thing is to get a list of the survivors.\" \"I've got it. I wrote a long list of things I wanted to know, and sent it to Mr. Carter. I got his reply this morning, and among other things it encloses the official statement of those saved from the _Lusitania_. How's that for clever little Tuppence?\" \"Full marks for industry, zero for modesty. But the great point is, is there a \u2018Rita' on the list?\" \"That's just what I don't know,\" confessed Tuppence. \"Don't know?\" \"Yes. Look here.\" Together they bent over the list. \"You see, very few Christian names are given. They're nearly all Mrs. or Miss.\" Tommy nodded. \"That complicates matters,\" he murmured thoughtfully. Tuppence gave her characteristic \"terrier\" shake. \"Well, we've just got to get down to it, that's all. We'll start with the London area. Just note down the addresses of any of the females who live in London or roundabout, while I put on my hat.\" Five minutes later the young couple emerged into Piccadilly, and a few seconds later a taxi was bearing them to The Laurels, Glendower Road, N.7, the residence of Mrs. Edgar Keith, whose name figured first in a list of seven reposing in Tommy's pocket-book. The Laurels was a dilapidated house, standing back from the road with a few grimy bushes to support the fiction of a front garden. Tommy paid off the taxi, and accompanied Tuppence to the front door bell. As she was about to ring it, he arrested her hand. \"What are you going to say?\" \"What am I going to say? Why, I shall say--Oh dear, I don't know. It's very awkward.\" \"I thought as much,\" said Tommy with satisfaction. \"How like a woman! No foresight! Now just stand aside, and see how easily the mere male deals with the situation.\" He pressed the bell. Tuppence withdrew to a suitable spot. A slatternly looking servant, with an extremely dirty face and a pair of eyes that did not match, answered the door. Tommy had produced a notebook and pencil. \"Good morning,\" he said briskly and cheerfully. \"From the Hampstead Borough Council. The new Voting Register. Mrs. Edgar Keith lives here, does she not?\" \"Yaas,\" said the servant. \"Christian name?\" asked Tommy, his pencil poised. \"Missus's? Eleanor Jane.\" \"Eleanor,\" spelt Tommy. \"Any sons or daughters over twenty-one?\" \"Naow.\" \"Thank you.\" Tommy closed the notebook with a brisk snap. \"Good morning.\" The servant volunteered her first remark: \"I thought perhaps as you'd come about the gas,\" she observed cryptically, and shut the door. Tommy rejoined his accomplice. \"You see, Tuppence,\" he observed. \"Child's play to the masculine mind.\" \"I don't mind admitting that for once you've scored handsomely. I should never have thought of that.\" \"Good wheeze, wasn't it? And we can repeat it _ad lib_.\" Lunch-time found the young couple attacking a steak and chips in an obscure hostelry with avidity. They had collected a Gladys Mary and a Marjorie, been baffled by one change of address, and had been forced to listen to a long lecture on universal suffrage from a vivacious American lady whose Christian name had proved to be Sadie. \"Ah!\" said Tommy, imbibing a long draught of beer, \"I feel better. Where's the next draw?\" The notebook lay on the table between them. Tuppence picked it up. \"Mrs. Vandemeyer,\" she read, \"20 South Audley Mansions. Miss Wheeler, 43 Clapington Road, Battersea. She's a lady's maid, as far as I remember, so probably won't be there, and, anyway, she's not likely.\" \"Then the Mayfair lady is clearly indicated as the first port of call.\" \"Tommy, I'm getting discouraged.\" \"Buck up, old bean. We always knew it was an outside chance. And, anyway, we're only starting. If we draw a blank in London, there's a fine tour of England, Ireland and Scotland before us.\" \"True,\" said Tuppence, her flagging spirits reviving. \"And all expenses paid! But, oh, Tommy, I do like things to happen quickly. So far, adventure has succeeded adventure, but this morning has been dull as dull.\" \"You must stifle this longing for vulgar sensation, Tuppence. Remember that if Mr. Brown is all he is reported to be, it's a wonder that he has not ere now done us to death. That's a good sentence, quite a literary flavour about it.\" \"You're really more conceited than I am--with less excuse! Ahem! But it certainly is queer that Mr. Brown has not yet wreaked vengeance upon us. (You see, I can do it too.) We pass on our way unscathed.\" \"Perhaps he doesn't think us worth bothering about,\" suggested the young man simply. Tuppence received the remark with great disfavour. \"How horrid you are, Tommy. Just as though we didn't count.\" \"Sorry, Tuppence. What I meant was that we work like moles in the dark, and that he has no suspicion of our nefarious schemes. Ha ha!\" \"Ha ha!\" echoed Tuppence approvingly, as she rose. South Audley Mansions was an imposing-looking block of flats just off Park Lane. No. 20 was on the second floor. Tommy had by this time the glibness born of practice. He rattled off the formula to the elderly woman, looking more like a housekeeper than a servant, who opened the door to him. \"Christian name?\" \"Margaret.\" Tommy spelt it, but the other interrupted him. \"No, _g u e_.\" \"Oh, Marguerite; French way, I see.\" He paused, then plunged boldly. \"We had her down as Rita Vandemeyer, but I suppose that's incorrect?\" \"She's mostly called that, sir, but Marguerite's her name.\" \"Thank you. That's all. Good morning.\" Hardly able to contain his excitement, Tommy hurried down the stairs. Tuppence was waiting at the angle of the turn. \"You heard?\" \"Yes. Oh, _Tommy!_\" Tommy squeezed her arm sympathetically. \"I know, old thing. I feel the same.\" \"It's--it's so lovely to think of things--and then for them really to happen!\" cried Tuppence enthusiastically. Her hand was still in Tommy's. They had reached the entrance hall. There were footsteps on the stairs above them, and voices. Suddenly, to Tommy's complete surprise, Tuppence dragged him into the little space by the side of the lift where the shadow was deepest. \"What the----\" \"Hush!\" Two men came down the stairs and passed out through the entrance. Tuppence's hand closed tighter on Tommy's arm. \"Quick--follow them. I daren't. He might recognize me. I don't know who the other man is, but the bigger of the two was Whittington.\" WHITTINGTON and his companion were walking at a good pace. Tommy started in pursuit at once, and was in time to see them turn the corner of the street. His vigorous strides soon enabled him to gain upon them, and by the time he, in his turn, reached the corner the distance between them was sensibly lessened. The small Mayfair streets were comparatively deserted, and he judged it wise to content himself with keeping them in sight. The sport was a new one to him. Though familiar with the technicalities from a course of novel reading, he had never before attempted to \"follow\" anyone, and it appeared to him at once that, in actual practice, the proceeding was fraught with difficulties. Supposing, for instance, that they should suddenly hail a taxi? In books, you simply leapt into another, promised the driver a sovereign--or its modern equivalent--and there you were. In actual fact, Tommy foresaw that it was extremely likely there would be no second taxi. Therefore he would have to run. What happened in actual fact to a young man who ran incessantly and persistently through the London streets? In a main road he might hope to create the illusion that he was merely running for a bus. But in these obscure aristocratic byways he could not but feel that an officious policeman might stop him to explain matters. At this juncture in his thoughts a taxi with flag erect turned the corner of the street ahead. Tommy held his breath. Would they hail it? He drew a sigh of relief as they allowed it to pass unchallenged. Their course was a zigzag one designed to bring them as quickly as possible to Oxford Street. When at length they turned into it, proceeding in an easterly direction, Tommy slightly increased his pace. Little by little he gained upon them. On In this he was completely foiled; they spoke low and the din of the traffic drowned their voices effectually. Just before the Bond Street Tube station they crossed the road, Tommy, unperceived, faithfully at their heels, and entered the big Lyons'. There they went up to"}]
