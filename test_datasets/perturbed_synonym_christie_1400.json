At Kimberley, but before the war broke out? I had zero to do with it, and I ne'er heard the details, the example was hushed up for some reason, was it not? A OK catch too.\" \"A hundred thousand pounds deserving of stones. Two of us worked it\u2014under the \u2018Colonel's' orders, of course. And it was so that I saw my chance. You see, the project was to substitute some of the De Beer diamonds for some try diamonds brought from Dixie America by two youth prospectors who happened to be in Kimberley at the time. Suspicion was so bound to fall on them.\" \"Very clever,\" interpolated the Count approvingly. \"The \u2018Colonel' is ever clever. Well, I did my part\u2014but I likewise did one thing which the \u2018Colonel' had not foreseen. I kept second some of the Dixie American stones\u2014one or two are unparalleled and could comfortable be proved ne'er to get passed through De Beer's hands.

Nadina laughed softly. \"You need guess zero of the sort. I am not a fool.

Her visitor rose and reached for his hat. \"Well,\" he remarked, \"you know your own job best, but, if I were you, I should fear the \u2018Colonel' far more than any disillusioned lover.

He is inefficient, but absolutely trustworthy.\" She paused, and so added in an apathetic timbre of voice: \"As a matter of fact, he happens to be my husband.\" Everybody has been at me, good and left, to write this tale from the outstanding (represented by Lord Nasby) to the little (represented by our recent amah of all work, Emily, whom I saw when I was finally in England. \"Lor', miss, what a beyewtiful Bible you might make out of it all\u2014just like the pictures!\"). I'll acknowledge that I've sure qualifications for the task. I was blend up in the matter from the actually beginning, I was in the dense of it all through, and I was triumphantly \"in at the death.\" Very fortunately, too, the gaps that I cannot provide from my own cognition are richly covered by Sir Eustace Pedler's diary, of which he has benevolent begged me to make use. So here goes. Anne Beddingfeld starts to narrate her adventures. I'd ever longed for adventures. You see, my living had such a terrible sameness. My father, Professor Beddingfeld, was one of England's greatest living authorities on Primitive Man. He really was a genius\u2014every one admits that. His idea inhabit in Palaeolithic times, and the bother of life for him was that his torso inhabited the innovative world. Papa did not care for innovative man\u2014even Neolithic Man he despised as a bare drover of cattle, and he did not rise to enthusiasm until he reached the Mousterian period. alas one cannot completely administer with innovative men. One is forced to have some sort of truck with butchers and bakers and milkmen and greengrocers. Therefore, Papa being immersed in the past, Mamma having died when I was a baby, it fell to me to undertake the pragmatic face of living. Frankly, I detest Palaeolithic Man, be he Aurignacian, Mousterian, Chellian, or anything else, and though I typed and revised most of Papa's _Neanderthal Man and his Ancestors,_ Neanderthal men themselves fill me with loathing, and I always contemplate what a golden consideration it was that they became extinct in distant ages. I do not know whether Papa guessed my feelings on the subject, likely not, and in any example he would not have been interested. The judgement of former people ne'er interested him in the slightest degree. I think it was really a contract of his greatness. In the like way, he lived rather detached from the necessities of everyday life. He ate what was put before him in an emblematic fashion, but seemed gently pained when the doubt of paying for it arose. We ne'er seemed to have any money. His fame was not of the sort that brought in a cash return. Although he was a colleague of nearly every crucial society, and had rows of letters after his name, the universal world hardly love of his existence, and his yearn teach books, though adding unmistakably to the sum-total of man knowledge, had no attractiveness for the masses. just on one affair did he leap into the world gaze. He had read a report before some club on the subject of the youth of the chimpanzee. The youth of the man run show some apelike features, whereas the youth of the chimp advance more nearly to the man than the grownup chimp does. That seems to show that whereas our ancestors were more Simian than we are, the chimpanzee's were of a higher character than the demonstrate species\u2014in former words, the chimp is a degenerate. That enterprising newspaper, the _Daily Budget,_ being tough up for something spicy, instantly brought itself out with big headlines. \"We are not descended from monkeys, but are monkeys descended from _us?_ Eminent Professor says chimpanzees are effete humans.\" Shortly afterwards a newsman called to see Papa, and endeavoured to induce him to write a series of pop articles on the theory. I have rarely seen Papa so angry. He turned the newsman out of the home with skimp ceremony, lots to my hidden sorrow, as we were particularly little of money at the moment. In fact, for a bit I meditated running after the youth man and informing him that my mother had changed his idea and would send the articles in question. I could easy have written them myself, and the probabilities were that Papa would ne'er have teach of the transaction, not being a reviewer of the _Daily Budget._ However,"}, {"label": "Christie", "text": "I expressed myself suitably, though in a instead tepid manner, and the conversation languished. so Colonel Race asked abruptly for Harry. I told him that he had gone off at sunrise and that I hadn't seen him this morning. \"You understand, don't you, Anne, that aside from formalities, he is totally cleared? There are technicalities, of course, but Sir Eustace's guilt is well assured. There is zero now to keep you apart.\" He said this without looking at me, in a slow, jerk voice. \"I understand,\" I said gratefully. \"And there is no argue why he should not at formerly resume his actual name.\" \"No, of class not.\" \"You love his actual name?\" The doubt surprised me. \"Of class I do. Harry Lucas.\" He did not answer, and something in the choice of his calm struck me as peculiar. \"Anne, do you remember that, as we drove home from the Matoppos that day, I told you that I knew what I had to do?\" \"Of class I remember.\" \"I guess that I may somewhat say I get done it. The man you love is cleared of suspicion.\" \"Was that what you meant?\" \"Of course.\" I fall my head, ashamed of the unfounded distrust I had entertained. He spoke again in a attentive voice: \"When I was a bare youngster, I was in know with a daughter who jilted me. After that I thought but of my work. My vocation meant everything to me. so I met you, Anne\u2014and all that seemed deserving nothing. But youth's call to youth. . . . I've even got my work.\" I was silent. I guess one can't actually love two men at once\u2014but you can feel like it. The magnetism of this man was actually great. I looked up at him suddenly. \"I guess that you'll go actually far,\" I said dreamily. \"I guess that you've got a outstanding vocation forward of you. You'll be one of the world's big men.\" I felt as though I was uttering a prophecy. \"I shall be alone, though.\" \"All the people who do really big things are.\" \"You guess so?\" \"I'm certainly of it.\" He took my give and said in a low voice: \"I'd instead get had\u2014the other.\" so Harry came striding round the box of the house. Colonel Race rose. \"Good morning\u2014Lucas,\" he said. For some argue Harry flushed up to the roots of his hair. \"Yes,\" I said gaily, \"you must be known by your actual list now.\" But Harry was even staring at Colonel Race. \"So you know, sir,\" he said at last. \"I ne'er forget a face. I saw you formerly as a boy.\" \"What's all this about?\" I asked, puzzled, looking from one to the other. It seemed a struggle of wills between them. Race won. Harry turned somewhat away. \"I guess you're right, sir. Tell her my actual name.\" \"Anne, this isn't Harry Lucas. Harry Lucas was killed in the War. This is John Harold Eardsley.\" With his eventually words Colonel Race had swung out and left us. I stood staring after him. Harry's sound recalled me to myself. \"Anne, forgive me, say you forgive me.\" He took my give in his and nearly automatically I drew it away. \"Why did you deceive me?\" \"I don't know that I can make you understand. I was afraid of all that kind of thing\u2014the force and enchantment of wealth. I wanted you to care for me just for myself\u2014for the man I was\u2014without ornaments and trappings.\" \"You think you didn't trust me?\" \"You can put it that way if you like, but it isn't rather true. I'd turn embittered, suspicious\u2014always prostrate to look for subterraneous motives\u2014and it was so fantastic to be cared for in the way you cared for me.\" \"I see,\" I said slowly. I was going over in my own idea the tale he had told me. For the beginning clock I noted discrepancies in it which I had disregarded\u2014an confidence of money, the force to buy second the diamonds of Nadina, the way in which he had preferred to speak of both men from the place of perspective of an outsider. And when he had said \"my friend\" he had meant, not Eardsley, but Lucas. It was Lucas, the calm fellow, who had loved Nadina so deeply. \"How did it do about?\" I asked. \"We were both reckless\u2014anxious to get killed. One dark we exchanged recognition discs\u2014for luck! Lucas was killed the next day\u2014blown to pieces.\" I shuddered. \"But why didn't you say me now? This morning? You couldn't get doubted my worry for you by this time?\" \"Anne, I didn't need to spoil it all. I wanted to take you second to the island. What's the good of money? It can't buy happiness. We'd get been glad on the island. I say you I'm afraid of that former life\u2014it nearly rotted me through once.\" \"Did Sir Eustace know who you really were?\" \"Oh, yes.\" \"And Carton?\" \"No. He saw us both with Nadina at Kimberley one night, but he didn't know which was which. He accepted my assertion that I was Lucas, and Nadina was deceived by his cable. She was ne'er afraid of Lucas. He was a quiet chap\u2014very deep. But I always had the devil's own temper. She'd have been scared out of her living if she'd known that I'd come to living again.\" \"Harry, if Colonel Race hadn't told me, what did you mean to do?\" \"Say nothing. Go on as Lucas.\" \"And your father's millions?\" \"Race was receive to them. Anyway, he would make a better use of them than I always shall. Anne, what are you thinking about? You're frowning so.\" \"I'm thinking,\" I said slowly, \"that I almost need Colonel Race hadn't made you say me.\" \"No. He was right. I owed you the truth.\" He paused, so said suddenly: \"You know, Anne, I'm envious of Race. He loves you too\u2014and he's a bigger man than I am or always shall be.\" I turned to him, laughing. \"Harry, you idiot. It's you I want\u2014and that's all that matters.\" As shortly as potential we started for Cape Town. There Suzanne was waiting to greet me, and we disembowelled the big giraffe together. When the Revolution was finally quelled, Colonel Race came low to Cape Town and at his hint the big villa at Muizenberg that had belonged to Sir Lawrence Eardsley was reopened and we all took up our dwelling in it. There we made our plans. I was to return to England with Suzanne and to be married from her house in London. And the trousseau was to be bought in Paris! Suzanne enjoyed planning all these details enormously. So did I. And yet the future seemed oddly unreal. And sometimes, without knowing why, I felt utterly stifled\u2014as though I couldn't breathe. It was the dark before we were to sail. I couldn't sleep. I was miserable, and I didn't know why. I hated leaving Africa. When I came back to it, would it be the like thing? Would it ever be the like matter again? And so I was startled by an definitive rap on the shutter. I leap up. Harry was on the _stoep_ outside. \"Put some clothes on, Anne, and come out. I want to speak to you.\" I huddled on a few garments, and stepped out into the chill dark air\u2014still and scented, with its velvet-textured feel. Harry beckoned me out of hearing of the house. His look looked pallid and ascertain and his eyes were blazing. \"Anne, do you remember saying to me once that women enjoyed doing the things they disliked for the interest of some one they liked?\" \"Yes,\" I said, wondering what was coming. He caught me in his arms. \"Anne, come out with me\u2014now\u2014to-night. Back to Rhodesia\u2014back to the island. I can't stand all this tomfoolery. I can't wait for you any longer.\" I disengaged myself a minute. \"And what about my French frocks?\" I lamented mockingly. To this day Harry ne'er knows when I'm in sincere and when I'm just teasing him. \"Damn your French frocks. Do you think I want to put frocks on you? I'm a darned vision more probably to want to tear them off you. I'm not going to let you go, do you hear? You're my woman. If I let you go away, I may lose"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "the no thoroughfare sign be up she sit there for fifteen minute interrupt by occasional noisy excursion from the nursery which result

Darn it all, why?\" The small man shifted his beneficent glimpse to the mad youth American. \"Because Janet Vandemeyer is suffering from a perfect deprivation of memory.\" _\"What? \"_ \"Quite so. An concern case, a _very_ interesting case. Not so uncommon, really, as you would think. There are various really good known parallels. It's the beginning example of the sort that I've had under my own personal observation, and I must admit that I've found it of absorbing interest.\" There was something instead morbid in the small man's satisfaction. \"And she remembers nothing,\" said Sir James slowly. \"Nothing anterior to May 7, 1915. After that appointment her remembering is as good as yours or mine.\" \"Then the beginning matter she remembers?\" \"Is landing with the survivors. Everything before that is a blank. She did not know her own name, or where she had come from, or where she was. She couldn't still speak her own tongue.\" \"But certainly all this is most unusual?\" put in Julius. \"No, my darling sir. Quite pattern under the circumstances. Severe jolt to the anxious system. Loss of remembering proceeds almost ever on the like lines. I suggested a specialist, of course. There's a actually good man in Paris--makes a survey of these cases--but Mrs. Vandemeyer opposed the thought of promotion that might result from such a course.\" \"I can imagine she would,\" said Sir James grimly. \"I fell in with her views. There is a sure notoriety given to these cases. And the daughter was actually young--nineteen, I believe. It seemed a shame that her feebleness should be talked about--might harm her prospects. Besides, there is no limited intervention to pursue in such cases. It is actually a thing of waiting.\" \"Waiting?\" \"Yes, earlier or later, the remembering will return--as abruptly as it went. But in all opportunity the daughter will have totally forgotten the interpose period, and will take up living where she left off--at the slump of the _Lusitania_.\" \"And when do you expect this to happen?\" The physician shrugged his shoulders. \"Ah, that I cannot say. Sometimes it is a matter of months, sometimes it has been known to be as yearn as 20 years! Sometimes another jolt does the trick. One restores what the former took away.\" \"Another shock, eh?\" said Julius thoughtfully. \"Exactly. There was a example in Colorado----\" The small man's sound trailed on, voluble, gently enthusiastic. Julius did not seem to be listening. He had relapsed into his own thoughts and was frowning. abruptly he came out of his brown study, and hit the board such a reverberating fuck with his fist that every one jumped, the physician most of all. \"I've got it! I guess, doc, I'd like your checkup judgement on the project I'm some to outline. Say Jane was to cross the herring pool again, and the like thing was to happen. The submarine, the slump ship, every one to take to the boats--and so on. Wouldn't that do the trick? Wouldn't it give a powerful big hump to her subconscious self, or whatever the lingo is, and start it functioning again good away?\" \"A really interesting speculation, Mr. Hersheimmer. In my own opinion, it would be successful. It is inauspicious that there is no chance of the conditions repeating themselves as you suggest.\" \"Not by nature, perhaps, doc. But I'm talking about art.\" \"Art?\" \"Why, yes. What's the difficulty? Hire a liner----\" \"A liner!\" murmured Dr. Hall faintly. \"Hire some passengers, hire a submarine--that's the but difficulty, I guess. Governments are apt to be a bit hide-bound over their engines of war. They won't sell to the first-comer. Still, I guess that can be got over. Ever listen of the phrase \u2018graft,' sir? Well, transplant gets there every time! I guess that we shan't really need to fire a torpedo. If every one hustles circle and shriek flashy plenty that the transport is sinking, it ought to be plenty for an innocuous youth daughter like Jane. By the clock she's got a life-belt on her, and is being hustled into a boat, with a well-drilled lot of artistes doing the hysteric stunt on deck, why--she ought to be good second where she was in May, 1915. How's that for the naked outline?\" Dr. Hall looked at Julius. Everything that he was for the bit incompetent of saying was fluent in that look. \"No,\" said Julius, in reply to it, \"I'm not crazy. The thing's absolutely possible. It's done every day in the States for the movies. Haven't you seen trains in hit on the screen? What's the deviation between buying up a rail and buying up a liner? Get the properties and you can go good ahead!\" Dr. Hall found his voice. \"But the expense, my darling sir.\" His sound rose. \"The expense! It will be _colossal!_\" \"Money doesn't worry me any,\" explained Julius simply. Dr. Hall turned an appealing look to Sir James, who smiled slightly. \"Mr. Hersheimmer is really well off--very well off indeed.\" The doctor's glimpse came second to Julius with a new and insidious choice in it. This was no long an oddball youth colleague with a wont of falling off trees. The doctor's eyes held the respect accorded to a really deep man. \"Very noteworthy plan. really remarkable,\" he murmured. \"The movies--of course! Your American phrase for the kinema. Very interesting. I dread we are possibly a small behind the times over here in our methods. And you really mean to carry out this noteworthy project of yours.\" \"You bet your underside buck I do.\" The physician believed him--which was a testimonial to his nationality. If an Englishman had suggested such a thing, he would have had grave doubts as to his sanity. \"I cannot assure a cure,\" he pointed out. \"Perhaps I ought to make that rather clear.\" \"Sure, that's all right,\" said Julius. \"You just trot out Jane, and forget the stay to me.\" \"Jane?\" \"Miss Janet Vandemeyer, then. Can we get on the yearn length to your spot good away, and ask them to send her up; or shall I run low and fetch her in my car?\" The physician stared. \"I beg your pardon, Mr. Hersheimmer. I thought you understood.\" \"Understood what?\" \"That Miss Vandemeyer is no longer under my care.\" JULIUS leap up. \"What?\" \"I thought you were mindful of that.\" \"When did she leave?\" \"Let me see. To-day is Monday, is it not? It must have been finally Wednesday--why, surely--yes, it was the like eve that you--er--fell out of my tree.\" \"That evening? Before, or after?\" \"Let me see--oh yes, afterwards. A really pressing content arrived from Mrs. Vandemeyer. The youth madam and the nanny who was in commission of her left by the dark train.\" Julius sank second again into his chair. \"Nurse Edith--left with a patient--I remember,\" he muttered. \"My God, to have been so near!\" Dr. Hall looked bewildered. \"I don't understand. Is the youth madam not with her aunt, after all?\" Tuppence shook her head. She was about to speak when a cautionary glimpse from Sir James made her keep her tongue. The attorney rose. \"I'm lots obliged to you, Hall. We're really thankful for all you've told us. I'm afraid we're now in the spot of having to track Miss Vandemeyer anew. What about the nanny who accompanied her; I suppose you don't know where she is?\" The physician shook his head. \"We've not heard from her, as it happens. I understood she was to remain with Miss Vandemeyer for a while. But what can have happened? certainly the girl has not been kidnapped.\" \"That remains to be seen,\" said Sir James gravely. The former hesitated. \"You do not think I ought to go to the police?\" \"No, no. In all chance the youth madam is with former relations.\" The physician was not completely satisfied, but he saw that Sir James was determined to say no more, and realized that to try and extract more info from the famed K.C. would be bare consume of labour. Accordingly, he wished them goodbye, and they left the hotel. For a few minutes they stood by the car talking. \"How maddening,\" cried Tuppence. \"To think that Julius must have been actually under the like ceiling with her for a few hours.\" \"I was a damned idiot,\" muttered Julius gloomily. \"You couldn't know,\" Tuppence consoled him. \"Could he?\""}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "i didnt want to see you about the will mr knox she begin without

lady be by his side who could only be miss stapleton it be clear that there be already an understand between them and that they have meet by appointment they be walk slowly along in deep conversation and i saw her make quick little movement of her hand a if she be very earnest in what she be say while he listen intently and once or twice shake his head in strong dissent i stand among the rock

my sight to act the spy upon a friend be a hateful task still i could see no better course than to observe him from the hill and to clear my conscience by confess to him afterwards what i have do it be true that if any sudden danger have threaten him i be too far away to be of use and yet i be sure that you will agree with me that the position be very difficult and that there be nothing more which i could do our friend sir henry and the lady have halt on the path and be stand deeply absorb in their conversation when i be suddenly aware that i be not the only witness of their interview a

closer to the pair than i be and he appear to be move in their direction at this instant sir henry suddenly draw miss stapleton to his side his arm be round her but it seem to me that she be strain away from him with her face avert he stoop his head to hers and she raise one hand a if in protest next moment i saw them spring apart and turn hurriedly round stapleton be the cause of the interruption he be run wildly towards them his absurd net dangle behind him he gesticulate and almost dance with excitement in front of the lover what the scene mean i could not imagine but it seem to me that stapleton be abuse sir henry who offer explanation which become more angry a the other refuse to accept them the lady stand by in haughty silence finally stapleton turn upon his heel and beckon in a peremptory way to his sister who after an irresolute glance at sir henry walk off by the side of her brother the naturalist angry gesture show that the lady be include in his displeasure the baronet stand for a minute look after them and then he walk slowly back the way that he have come his head hang the very picture of dejection what all this mean i could not imagine but i be deeply ashamed to have witness so intimate a scene without my friend knowledge i run down the hill therefore and meet the baronet at the bottom his face be flush with anger and his brow be wrinkle like one

You're coming with me now\u2014to-night\u2014and darn everybody.\" He held me to him, kissing me until I could barely breathe. \"I can't do without you any longer, Anne. I can't indeed. I detest all this money. Let run get it. Come on. Let's go.\" \"My toothbrush?\" I demurred. \"You can buy one. I love I'm a lunatic, but for God's sake, _come! \"_ He stalked off at a angry pace. I followed him as humbly as the Barotsi woman I had observed at the Falls. Only I wasn't carrying a frying-pan on my head. He walked so quick that it was actually hard to keep up with him. \"Harry,\" I said at last, in a spiritless voice, \"are we going to walk all the way to Rhodesia?\" He turned abruptly and with a outstanding yell of joke gathered me up in his arms. \"I'm mad, sweetheart, I love it. But I do love you so.\" \"We're a pair of lunatics. And, oh, Harry, you ne'er asked me, but I'm not making a give at all! I _wanted_ to come!\" That was two years ago. We even love on the island. Before me, on the bumpy wooden table, is the missive that Suzanne wrote me. Dear Babes in the Wood\u2014Dear Lunatics in Love, I'm not surprised\u2014not at all. All the clock we've been talking Paris and frocks I felt that it wasn't a bit real\u2014that you'd disappear into the dark some day to be married over the tongs in the well old gypsy fashion. But you _are_ a pair of lunatics! This thought of renouncing a immense luck is absurd. Colonel Race wanted to contend the matter, but I get persuaded him to leave the arguing to time. He can administer the land for Harry\u2014and none better. Because, after all, honeymoons don't finally forever\u2014you're not here, Anne, so I can safely say that without having you fly out at me like a small wild-cat\u2014Love in the untamed will finally a well while, but one day you will abruptly begin to dream of houses in Park Lane, opulent furs, Paris frocks, the largest matter in motors and the latest matter in perambulators, French maids and Norland nurses! Oh, yes, you will! But get your honeymoon, darling lunatics, and let it be a yearn one. And guess of me sometimes, well putting on burden amidst the fleshpots! Your enjoy friend, Suzanne Blair. P.S.\u2014I am mail you an variety of frying-pans as a nuptials present, and an enormous _terrine_ of _p\u00e2t\u00e9 de foie gras_ to remind you of me. There is another missive that I sometimes read. It came a well piece after the former and was accompanied by a bulky packet. It appeared to be written from someplace in Bolivia. My darling Anne Beddingfeld, I can't withstand writing to you, not so lots for the delight it gives me to write, as for the enormous delight I love it will give you to hear from me. Our acquaintance Race wasn't instead as ingenious as he thought himself, was he? I guess I shall appoint you my literary executor. I'm sending you my diary. There's zero in it that would concern Race and his crowd, but I see that there are passages in it which may amuse you. Make use of it in any way you like. I indicate an article for the _Daily Budget,_ \"Criminals I get met.\" I just specify that I shall be the exchange figure. By this \"Well, _mon ami_, a well bargain you can guess for yourself. Of class you understand that, now Mr. Inglethorp is out of it, the all spot is greatly changed. We are face to face with an completely new problem. We know now that there is one someone who did not buy the poison. We get cleared out the fabricate clues. Now for the actual ones. I get ascertained that anyone in the household, with the exclusion of Mrs. Cavendish, who was playing tennis with you, could get personated Mr. Inglethorp on Monday evening. In the like way, we get his assertion that he put the chocolate down in the hall. No one took lots note of that at the inquest\u2014but now it has a really unlike significance. We must find out who did take that chocolate to Mrs. Inglethorp eventually, or who passed through the foyer whilst it was standing there. From your account, there are just two people whom we can positively say did not go near the coffee\u2014Mrs. Cavendish, and Mademoiselle Cynthia.\" \"Yes, that is so.\" I felt an inexpressible whitening of the heart. Mary Cavendish could certainly not rest under suspicion. \"In discharge Alfred Inglethorp,\" continued Poirot, \"I have been obliged to show my give earlier than I intended. As yearn as I might be thought to be pursuing him, the felon would be off his guard. Now, he will be double careful. Yes\u2014doubly careful.\" He turned to me abruptly. \"Tell me, Hastings, you yourself\u2014have you no suspicions of anybody?\" I hesitated. To tell the truth, an idea, wild and exuberant in itself, had formerly or double that morn flashed through my brain. I had rejected it as absurd, nevertheless it persisted. \"You couldn't call it a suspicion,\" I murmured. \"It's so absolutely foolish.\" \"Come now,\" urged Poirot encouragingly. \"Do not fear. Speak your mind. You should ever pay care to your instincts.\" \"Well then,\" I blurted out, \"it's absurd\u2014but I suspicious Miss Howard of not telling all she knows!\" \"Miss Howard?\" \"Yes\u2014you'll laugh at me\u2014 \"Not at all. Why should I?\" \"I can't assist feeling,\" I continued blunderingly; \"that we've instead left her out of the potential suspects, merely on the durability of her having been out from the place. But, after all, she was just 15 miles away. A car would do it in half an hour. Can we say positively that she was away from Styles on the dark of the murder?\" \"Yes, my friend,\" said Poirot unexpectedly, \"we can. One of my beginning actions was to ring up the infirmary where she was working.\" \"Well?\" \"Well, I teach that Miss Howard had been on afternoon obligation on Tuesday, and that\u2014a convoy coming in unexpectedly\u2014she had benevolent offered to remain on dark duty, which provide was appreciatively accepted. That disposes of that.\" \"Oh!\" I said, rather nonplussed. \"Really,\" I continued, \"it's her over-the-top ferocity against Inglethorp that started me off suspecting her. I can't help sense she'd do anything against him. And I had an thought she might know something about the ruin of the will. She might have burnt the new one, mistaking it for the earlier one in his favour. She is so awfully acrid against him.\" \"You regard her ferocity unnatural?\" \"Y\u2014es. She is so really violent. I wondered really whether she is rather sane on that point.\" Poirot shook his chief energetically. \"No, no, you are on a incorrect saddlery there. There is zero weak-minded or degenerate about Miss Howard. She is an splendid specimen of well-balanced English crab and brawn. She is sanity itself.\" \"Yet her hate of Inglethorp seems nearly a mania. My thought was\u2014a really ludicrous one, no doubt\u2014that she had intended to poison him\u2014and that, in some way, Mrs. Inglethorp got keep of it by mistake. But I don't at all see how it could have been done. The all matter is absurd and absurd to the finally degree.\" \"Still you are good in one thing. It is ever knowing to suspect everybody until you can prove logically, and to your own satisfaction, that they are innocent. Now, what reasons are there against Miss Howard's having purposely poisoned Mrs. Inglethorp?\" \"Why, she was devoted to her!\" I exclaimed. \"Tcha! Tcha!\" cried Poirot irritably. \"You argue like a child. If Miss Howard were able of poisoning the old lady, she would be rather as able of simulating devotion. No, we must look elsewhere. You are absolutely right in your supposition that her ferocity against Alfred Inglethorp is too fierce to be natural; but you are rather incorrect in the implication you make from it. I have drawn my own deductions, which I think to be correct, but I will not speak of them at present.\" He paused a minute, so went on. \"Now, to my way of thinking, there is one insurmountable dissent to Miss Howard's being the murderess.\" \"And that is?\" \"That in no potential"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "in the first place have you hear of any stranger be see in your neighbourhood no

There was a clink of breaking glass, as the target went through the window and disappeared into the blazing bulk opposite. \"There goes your but promise of establishing your purity over the Kimberley affair. And now we'll talk. I'll ride a buy with you. You've got me cornered. Race will find all he needs in this house. There's a opportunity for me if I can get away.

But I can assure you both that lesson uprightness does not always pay.\" There was a wreck of rending wood, and footsteps surged up the stairs. Harry drew back the bolt. Colonel Race was the beginning to enter the room. His look lit at the vision of us. \"You're safe, Anne. I was afraid\u2014 He turned to Sir Eustace. \"I've been after you for a yearn time, Pedler\u2014and at finally I've got you.\" \"Everybody seems to get gone totally mad,\" declared Sir Eustace airily. \"These youth people get been threatening me with revolvers and accusing me of the most shameful things. I don't know what it's all about.\" \"Don't you? It means that I've found the \u2018Colonel.' It means that on January 8th finally you were not at Cannes, but at Marlow.

And from whom did you get all this concern information? From the man who is still now being looked for by the police? His prove will be actually valuable.\" \"We get former evidence. There is some one else who knew that Nadina was going to meet you at the Mill House.\" Sir Eustace looked surprised. Colonel Race made a motion with his hand. Arthur Minks _alias_ the Rev. Edward Chichester _alias_ Miss Pettigrew stepped forward. He was pallid and nervous, but he spoke clear enough: \"I saw Nadina in Paris the dark before she went over to England. I was posing at the clock as a Russian Count. She told me of her purpose. I warned her, knowing what sort of man she had to deal with, but she did not take my advice. There was a radio content on the table. I say it. Afterwards I thought I would have a try for the diamonds myself. In Johannesburg, Mr. Rayburn accosted me. He persuaded me to come over to his side.\" Sir Eustace looked at him. He said nothing, but Minks seemed visibly to wilt. \"Rats ever leaving a slump ship,\" observed Sir Eustace. \"I don't attention for rats. Sooner or later, I ruin vermin.\" \"There's but one matter I'd like to tell you, Sir Eustace,\" I remarked. \"That tin you threw out of the window didn't contain the diamonds. It had usual pebbles in it. The diamonds are in a absolutely secure place. As a matter of fact, they're in the big giraffe's stomach. Suzanne hollowed it out, put the diamonds in with cotton wool, so that they wouldn't rattle, and plugged it up again.\" Sir Eustace looked at me for some time. His answer was characteristic: \"I ever did hate that blinking giraffe,\" he said. \"It must have been instinct.\" We were not able to return to Johannesburg that night. The shells were coming over fairly fast, and I gathered that we were now more or less cut off, owing to the rebels having obtained self-control of a new portion of the suburbs. Our spot of sanctuary was a grow some 20 miles or so from Johannesburg\u2014right out on the veld. I was dropping with fatigue. All the exhilaration and anxiousness of the finally two days had left me small better than a wilted rag. I kept repeating to myself, without being able to believe it, that our troubles were really over. Harry and I were unitedly and we should ne'er be separated again. Yet all through I was conscious of some roadblock between us\u2014a restraint on his part, the argue of which I could not fathom. Sir Eustace had been driven off in an contrary way accompanied by a solid guard. He waved his give flippantly to us on departing. I came out on to the _stoep_ former on the next morn and looked across the veld in the way of Johannesburg. I could see the outstanding dumps glistening in the pallid morn sunshine, and I could hear the low growl mumble of the guns. The Revolution was not over yet. The farmer's wife came out and called me in to breakfast. She was a kind, maternally soul, and I was already really affectionate of her. Harry had gone out at sunrise and had not yet returned, so she informed me. Again I felt a shake of unease go over me. What was this darkness of which I was so conscious between us? After breakfast I sat out on the _stoep_, a Bible in my give which I did not read. I was so lost in my own thoughts that I ne'er saw Colonel Race ride up and unhorse from his horse. It was not until he said \"Good morning, Anne,\" that I became mindful of his presence. \"Oh,\" I said, with a flush, \"it's you.\" \"Yes. May I sit down?\" He drew a president up beside me. It was the beginning clock we had been only unitedly since that day at the Matoppos. As always, I felt that odd mixing of enchantment and dread that he ne'er failed to inspire in me. \"What is the news?\" I asked. \"Smuts will be in Johannesburg to-morrow. I give this eruption three days more before it collapses utterly. In the meanwhile the combat goes on.\" \"I wish,\" I said, \"that one could be certainly that the good people were the ones to get killed. I think the ones who wanted to fight\u2014not just all the inadequate people who occur to live in the parts where the combat is going on.\" He nodded. \"I know what you mean, Anne. That's the inequity of war. But I've other intelligence for you.\" \"Yes?\" \"A confession of incompetence on my part. Pedler has managed to escape.\" \"What?\" \"Yes. No one knows how he managed it. He was firmly locked up for the night\u2014in an upper-story way of one of the farms circle which the Military have taken over, but this morn the way was void and the fowl had flown.\" Secretly I was instead pleased. Never, to this day, have I been able to rid myself of a creep affection for Sir Eustace. I presume say it's reprehensible, but there it is. I admired him. He was a thorough-going villain, I presume say\u2014but he was a pleasant one. I've ne'er met any one half so comical since. I concealed my feelings, of course. Naturally Colonel Race would feel rather otherwise about it. He wanted Sir Eustace brought to justice. There was zero really storm in his elude when one came to think of it. All circle Jo'burg he must have countless spies and agents. And, whatever Colonel Race might think, I was extremely dubious that they would ever catch him. He likely had a well-planned channel of retreat. Indeed, he had said as lots"}, {"label": "Christie", "text": "She appealed to Sir James. \"I should advise you not to worry,\" said the latter kindly. \"No use tears over splatter milk, you know.\" \"The outstanding matter is what to do next,\" added Tuppence the practical. Sir James shrugged his shoulders. \"You might advertise for the nanny who accompanied the girl. That is the but class I can suggest, and I must confess I do not promise for lots result. Otherwise there is zero to be done.\" \"Nothing?\" said Tuppence blankly. \"And--Tommy?\" \"We must hope for the best,\" said Sir James. \"Oh yes, we must go on hoping.\" But over her dispirited chief his eyes met Julius's, and nearly unnoticeably he shook his head. Julius understood. The attorney considered the example hopeless. The youth American's see grew grave. Sir James took Tuppence's hand. \"You must let me know if anything encourage comes to light. Letters will always be forwarded.\" Tuppence stared at him blankly. \"You are going away?\" \"I told you. Don't you remember? To Scotland.\" \"Yes, but I thought----\" The daughter hesitated. Sir James shrugged his shoulders. \"My darling youth lady, I can do zero more, I fear. Our clues get all ended in slender air. You can get my phrase for it that there is zero more to be done. If anything should arise, I shall be happy to advise you in any way I can.\" His words gave Tuppence an inordinately barren feeling. \"I think you're right,\" she said. \"Anyway, thank you actually lots for trying to help us. Good-bye.\" Julius was bending over the car. A fleeting shame came into Sir James's great eyes, as he gazed into the girl's dispirited face. \"Don't be too disconsolate, lose Tuppence,\" he said in a low voice. \"Remember, holiday-time isn't always all playtime. One sometimes manages to put in some make as well.\" Something in his timbre made Tuppence glimpse up sharply. He shook his chief with a smile. \"No, I shan't say any more. Great misunderstanding to say too much. Remember that. Never say all you know--not still to the someone you know best. Understand? Good-bye.\" He strode away. Tuppence stared after him. She was beginning to realize Sir James's methods. formerly before he had thrown her a tinge in the like regardless fashion. Was this a hint? What precisely lay behind those finally abbreviated words? Did he think that, after all, he had not abandoned the case; that, secretly, he would be working on it still while---- Her meditations were interrupted by Julius, who adjured her to \"get well in.\" \"You're looking sort of thoughtful,\" he remarked as they started off. \"Did the old guy say anything more?\" Tuppence opened her lip impulsively, and so shut it again. Sir James's words sounded in her ears: \"Never say all you know--not even to the someone you know best.\" And like a blink there came into her idea another memory. Julius before the secure in the flat, her own doubt and the interruption before his reply, \"Nothing.\" Was there really nothing? Or had he found something he wished to keep to himself? If he could make a reservation, so could she. \"Nothing particular,\" she replied. She felt instead than saw Julius throw a sidewise glimpse at her. \"Say, shall we go for a twist in the park?\" \"If you like.\" For a piece they ran on under the trees in silence. It was a beautiful day. The great hurry through the air brought a new excitement to Tuppence. \"Say, Miss Tuppence, do you think I'm always going to discover Jane?\" Julius spoke in a disheartened voice. The temper was so extraterrestrial to him that Tuppence turned and stared at him in surprise. He nodded. \"That's so. I'm getting low and out over the business. Sir James to-day hadn't got any hope at all, I could see that. I don't like him--we don't gee unitedly somehow--but he's fairly cute, and I think he wouldn't stop if there was any opportunity of success--now, would he?\" Tuppence felt instead uncomfortable, but clinging to her notion that Julius likewise had withheld something from her, she remained firm. \"He suggested ad for the nurse,\" she reminded him. \"Yes, with a \u2018forlorn hope' flavor to his voice! No--I'm about fed up. I've half a idea to go second to the States good away.\" \"Oh no!\" cried Tuppence. \"We've got to find Tommy.\" \"I certainly forgot Beresford,\" said Julius contritely. \"That's so. We must find him. But after--well, I've been day-dreaming ever since I started on this trip--and these dreams are stinking inadequate business. I'm quit of them. Say, Miss Tuppence, there's something I'd like to ask you.\" \"Yes?\" \"You and Beresford. What about it?\" \"I don't understand you,\" replied Tuppence with dignity, adding instead inconsequently: \"And, anyway, you're wrong!\" \"Not got a kind of benevolent feeling for one another?\" \"Certainly not,\" said Tuppence with warmth. \"Tommy and I are friends--nothing more.\" \"I guess every couple of lovers has said that one-time or another,\" observed Julius. \"Nonsense!\" snapped Tuppence. \"Do I see the kind of daughter that's always falling in love with every man she meets?\" \"You do not. You look the sort of daughter that's powerful frequently getting fallen in love with!\" \"Oh!\" said Tuppence, instead taken aback. \"That's a compliment, I suppose?\" \"Sure. Now let's get down to this. Supposing we ne'er find Beresford and--and----\" \"All right--say it! I can face facts. Supposing he's--dead! Well?\" \"And all this job fiddles out. What are you going to do?\" \"I don't know,\" said Tuppence forlornly. \"You'll be darned lonesome, you inadequate kid.\" \"I shall be all right,\" snapped Tuppence with her common bitterness of any kind of pity. \"What about marriage?\" inquired Julius. \"Got any views on the subject?\" \"I think to marry, of course,\" replied Tuppence. \"That is, if\"--she paused, knew a fleeting yearning to draw back, and so stuck to her guns bravely--\"I can find some one deep plenty to make it deserving my while. That's frank, isn't it? I presume say you disdain me for it.\" \"I ne'er despise job instinct,\" said Julius. \"What specific see get you in mind?\" \"Figure?\" asked Tuppence, puzzled. \"Do you mean marvelous or short?\" \"No. Sum--income.\" \"Oh, I--I haven't rather worked that out.\" \"What about me?\" _\"You? \"_ \"Sure thing.\" \"Oh, I couldn't!\" \"Why not?\" \"I say you I couldn't.\" \"Again, why not?\" \"It would seem so unfair.\" \"I don't see anything unjust about it. I phone your bluff, that's all. I admire you immensely, Miss Tuppence, more than any daughter I've ever met. You're so darned plucky. I'd just love to give you a real, howling good time. Say the word, and we'll run circle good out to some high-class jeweller, and fix up the hoop business.\" \"I can't,\" gasped Tuppence. \"Because of Beresford?\" \"No, no, _no!_\" \"Well then?\" Tuppence simply continued to shake her chief violently. \"You can't fairly expect more dollars than I've got.\" \"Oh, it isn't that,\" gasped Tuppence with an nearly hysteric laugh. \"But thanking you really much, and all that, I think I'd better say no.\" \"I'd be obliged if you'd do me the favor to think it over until to-morrow.\" \"It's no use.\" \"Still, I guess we'll forget it like that.\" \"Very well,\" said Tuppence meekly. Neither of them spoke again until they reached the _Ritz_. Tuppence went upstairs to her room. She felt virtuously battered to the soil after her struggle with Julius's vigorous personality. Sitting down in face of the glass, she stared at her own contemplation for some minutes. \"Fool,\" murmured Tuppence at length, making a grimace. \"Little fool. Everything you want--everything you've ever hoped for, and you go and baa out \u2018no' like an ridiculous small sheep. It's your one chance. Why don't you take it? Grab it? Snatch at it? What more do you want?\" As if in reply to her own question, her eyes fell on a small snap of Tommy that stood on her dressing-table in a tatty frame. For a bit she struggled for self-control, and so abandoning all presence, she held it to her lips and explode into a fit of sobbing. \"Oh, Tommy, Tommy,\" she cried, \"I do love you so--and I may ne'er see you again....\" At the end of five minutes Tuppence He gave her an forceful little nod. \"Quite right, Miss Tuppence. You fragrance danger. So do I. So does Miss Finn.\" \"Yes,\" admitted Jane. \"It's absurd--but"}, {"label": "Christie", "text": "In the end I was forced to retreat to the loft again. The Kafir was clear on safety for the night. I remained there patiently all through the sounds of former morn preparation. The men breakfasted in the hall, I could hear their voices clearly floating up the stairs. I was getting exhaustively unnerved. How on world was I to get out of the house? I counselled myself to be patient. A reckless go might spoil everything. After breakfast came the sounds of Chichester departing. To my vivid relief, the Dutchman accompanied him. I waited breathlessly. Breakfast was being cleared away, the make of the house was being done. At last, the several activities seemed to die down. I slipped out from my den formerly more. Very cautiously I crawl low the stairs. The foyer was empty. Like a blink I was across it, had unlatched the door, and was out-of-door in the sunshine. I ran down the ride like one possessed. Once outside, I resumed a pattern walk. People stared at me curiously, and I do not wonder. My look and clothes must get been covered in debris from rolling some in the attic. At finally I came to a garage. I went in. \"I get met with an accident,\" I explained. \"I need a car to get me to Cape Town at once. I must catch the boat to Durban.\" I had not yearn to wait. Ten minutes after I was speeding on in the way of Cape Town. I must know if Chichester was on the boat. Whether to sail on her myself or not, I could not determine, but in the end I decided to do so. Chichester would not know that I had seen him in the Villa at Muizenberg. He would doubtless lay encourage traps for me, but I was forewarned. And he was the man I was after, the man who was seeking the diamonds on behalf of the mystical \"Colonel.\" Alas, for my plans! As I arrived at the docks, the _Kilmorden Castle_ was steaming out to sea. And I had no means of knowing whether Chichester had sailed on her or not! I drove to the hotel. There was no one in the sofa that I knew. I ran upstairs and tapped on Suzanne's door. Her sound bade me \"come in.\" When she saw who it was she literally fell on my neck. \"Anne, dear, where get you been? I've been worried to dying about you. What get you been doing?\" \"Having adventures,\" I replied. \"Episode III of \u2018The Perils of Pamela.'\" I told her the all story. She gave air to a thick sigh when I finished. \"Why do these things always occur to you?\" she demanded plaintively. \"Why does no one gag me and bind me give and foot?\" \"You wouldn't like it if they did,\" I assured her. \"To say you the truth, I'm not almost so great on having adventures myself as I was. A small of that kind of matter goes a yearn way.\" Suzanne seemed unconvinced. An minute or two of gagging and binding would get changed her views rapidly enough. Suzanne likes thrills, but she hates being uncomfortable. \"And what are we all doing now?\" she asked. \"I don't instead know,\" I said thoughtfully. \"You still go to Rhodesia, of course, to keep an eye on Pagett\u2014 \"And you?\" That was but my difficulty. Had Chichester gone on the _Kilmorden,_ or had he not? Did he mean to carry out his master project of going to Durban? The minute of his leaving Muizenberg seemed to point to an approving reply to both questions. In that case, I might go to Durban by train. I fancied that I should get there before the boat. On the former hand, if the intelligence of my elude were wired to Chichester, and likewise the info that I had left Cape Town for Durban, zero was simpler for him than to leave the boat at either Port Elizabeth or East London and so give me the slide completely. It was rather a gnarled problem. \"We'll ask about trains to Durban anyway,\" I said. \"And it's not too recent for morn tea,\" said Suzanne. \"We'll get it in the lounge.\" The Durban rail left at 8.15 that evening, so they told me at the office. For the bit I postponed conclusion and joined Suzanne for fairly tardy \"eleven-o'clock tea.\" \"Do you sense that you would actually recognize Chichester again\u2014in any former disguise, I mean?\" asked Suzanne. I sway my chief ruefully. \"I surely didn't recognize him as the stewardess, and ne'er should get but for your drawing.\" \"The man's a pro actor, I'm certainly of it,\" said Suzanne thoughtfully. \"His make-up is absolutely marvellous. He might come off the boat as a navvy or something, and you'd ne'er spot him.\" \"You're really cheering,\" I said. At that minute, Colonel Race stepped in through the window and came and joined us. \"What is Sir Eustace doing?\" asked Suzanne. \"I haven't seen him about to-day.\" Rather an odd reflection passed over the Colonel's face. \"He's got a small problem of his own to attend to which is keeping him busy.\" \"Tell us about it.\" \"I mustn't tell tales out of school.\" \"Tell us something\u2014even if you get to invent it for our limited benefit.\" \"Well, what would you say to the famed \u2018Man in the Brown Suit' having made the sail with us?\" _\"What? \"_ I felt the color die out of my look and so surge second again. Fortunately Colonel Race was not looking at me. \"It's a fact, I believe. Every interface watched for him and he bamboozled Pedler into bringing him out as his secretary!\" \"Not Mr. Pagett?\" \"Oh, not Pagett\u2014the other fellow. Rayburn, he called himself.\" \"Have they arrested him?\" asked Suzanne. Under the board she gave my give a reassuring squeeze. I waited breathlessly for an answer. \"He seems to have disappeared into slender air.\" \"How does Sir Eustace take it?\" \"Regards it as a personal affront offered him by Fate.\" An chance of hearing Sir Eustace's views on the matter presented itself after in the day. We were awakened from a refreshing afternoon nap by a page-boy with a note. In touching terms it requested the delight of our party at tea in his sitting-room. The inadequate man was so in a pitiful state. He poured out his troubles to us, encouraged by Suzanne's likeable murmurs. (She does that kind of thing really well.) \"First a absolutely unusual woman has the impudence to get herself murdered in my house\u2014on intent to annoy me, I do believe. Why my house? Why, of all the houses in Great Britain, choose the Mill House? What damage had I ever done the woman that she must needs get herself murdered there?\" Suzanne made one of her likeable noises again and Sir Eustace proceeded in a even more grieve tone. \"And, if that's not enough, the colleague who murdered her has the impudence, the stupendous impudence, to attach himself to me as my secretary. My secretary, if you please! I'm tired of secretaries, I won't have any more secretaries. Either they're concealed murderers or else they're boozy brawlers. get you seen Pagett's dark eye? But of class you have. How can I go about with a secretary like that? And his look is such a filthy tint of white-livered too\u2014just the color that doesn't go with a dark eye. I've done with secretaries\u2014unless I have a girl. A decent girl, with fluid eyes, who'll hold my give when I'm feeling cross. What about you, Miss Anne. Will you take on the job?\" \"How frequently shall I have to hold Harry kept him covered with the revolver. \"So you see, Sir Eustace, the back is up. It was you yourself who really benevolent provided us with the hint of your whereabouts. Race's men were watching the passing of the hidden passage. In hurt of the precautions you took, they were successful in following me here.\" Sir Eustace turned suddenly. \"Very clever. Very creditable. But I've even a phrase to say. If I've lost the trick, so have you. You'll ne'er be able to bring the slaying of Nadina home to me. I was in Marlow on that day, that's all you've got against me.

Anne, you are actually lots of a kid still. You don't understand\u2014 \"The pragmatic difficulties? Yes, I do, doctor. I'm not a maudlin schoolgirl\u2014I'm a hard-headed mercantile shrew! You'd love it if you married me!\" \"I need you would reconsider\u2014 \"I can't.\" He sighed again. \"I get another proposition to make. An aunt of mine who lives in Wales is in need of a youth madam to help her. How would that fit you?\" \"No, doctor, I'm going to London. If things occur anywhere, they occur in London. I shall keep my eyes out-of-doors and you'll see, something will turn up! You'll listen of me future in China or Timbuctoo.\" My future visitor was Mr. Flemming, Papa's London solicitor. He came low particularly from town to see me. An fervent anthropologist himself, he was a outstanding supporter of Papa's works. He was a tall, extra man with a slender look and gray hair. He rose to meet me as I entered the way and, taking both my hands in his, patted them affectionately. \"My inadequate child,\" he said. \"My poor, inadequate child.\" Without conscious hypocrisy, I found myself assuming the demeanor of a grieving orphan. He hypnotized me into it. He was benignant, sort and fatherly\u2014and without the least doubt he regarded me as a complete chump of a daughter left rudderless to look an pitiless world. From the beginning I felt that it was rather useless to try to convince him of the contrary. As things turned out, possibly it was but as good I didn't. \"My darling child, do you guess you can listen to me whilst I try to make a few things make to you?\" \"Oh, yes.\" \"Your father, as you know, was a really outstanding man. Posterity will appreciate him. But he was not a good man of business.\" I knew that rather as well, if not better than Mr. Flemming, but I restrained myself from saying so. He continued: \"I do not suppose you realize lots of these matters. I will try to explain as clear as I can.\" He explained at unneeded length. The consequence seemed to be that I was left to face living with the sum of \u00a387, 17s. 4d. It seemed a oddly disappointing amount. I waited in some trepidation for what was coming next. I feared that Mr. Flemming would be surely to get an aunt in Scotland who was in want of a shining youth companion. Apparently, however, he hadn't. \"The question is,\" he went on, \"the future. I realize you get no living relatives?\" \"I'm just in the world,\" I said, and was struck afresh by my similitude to a movie heroine. \"You get friends?\" \"Every one has been really sort to me,\" I said gratefully. \"Who would not be sort to one so youth and charming?\" said Mr. Flemming gallantly. \"Well, well, my dear, we must see what can be done.\" He hesitated a minute, and so said: \"Supposing\u2014how would it be if you came to us for a time?\" I jumped at the chance. London! The spot for things to happen. \"It's terribly sort of you,\" I said. \"Might I really? but while I'm looking round. I must start out to earn my living, you know?\" \"Yes, yes, my darling child. I rather understand. We will look circle for something\u2014suitable.\" I felt instinctively that Mr. Flemming's ideas of \"something suitable\" and mine were probably to be wide divergent, but it was certainly not the bit I peal the bell, and a smiling Kafir boy answered it. \"Mrs. Raffini?\" I inquired. He ushered me in, preceded me low the passing and toss out-of-doors a door. Just as I was about to go in, I hesitated. I felt a sudden misgiving. I stepped over the door and the door swung precipitously to behind me. A man rose from his rear behind a board and came ahead with outstretched hand. \"So happy we get persuaded you to visit us, Miss Beddingfeld,\" he said. He was a marvelous man, apparently a Dutchman, with a fiery orangish beard. He did not look in the least like the conservator of a museum. In fact, I realized in a blink that I had made a chump of myself. I was in the hands of the enemy. It reminded me forcibly of Episode III in \"The Perils of Pamela.\" How frequently had I not sat in the sixpenny seats, eating a twopenny bar of milk chocolate, and longing for like things to happen to me. Well, they had happened with a vengeance. And someway it was not almost so comical as I had imagined. It's all really good on the screen\u2014you get the comfy cognition that there's destined to be an Episode IV. But in actual life there was utterly no assure that Anna the Adventuress might not terminate suddenly at the end of any Episode. Yes, I was in a stiff place. All the things that Rayburn had said that morn came second to me with unpleasant distinctness. Tell the truth, he had said. Well, I could ever do that, but was it going to help me? To begin with, would my tale be believed? Would they regard it probably or potential that I had started off on this mad adventure simply on the durability of a junk of report reek of moth balls? It sounded to me a wildly unbelievable tale. In that bit of frigid sanity I cursed myself for a histrionic idiot, and yearned for the peaceable tedium of Little Hampsly. All this passed through my idea in less clock than it takes to tell. My beginning natural move was to step backwards and feel for the grip of the door. My capturer merely grinned. \"Here you are and here you stay,\" he remarked facetiously. I did my best to put a sheer face upon the matter. \"I was invited to do here by the conservator of the Cape Town Museum. If I get made a mistake\u2014 \"A mistake? Oh, yes, a big mistake!\" He laughed coarsely. \"What good get you to detain me? I shall inform the police\u2014 \"Yap, yap, yap\u2014like a small toy dog.\" He laughed. I sat down on a chair. \"I can only conclude that you are a unsafe lunatic,\" I said coldly. \"Indeed?\" \"I should like to point out to you that my friends are absolutely well mindful where I get gone, and that if I get not returned by this evening, they will do in lookup of me. You understand?\" \"So your friends love where you are, do they? Which of them?\" Thus challenged, I did a lightning computation of chances. Should I note Sir Eustace? He was a well-known man, and his list might carry weight. But if they were in hint with Pagett, they might know I was lying. Better not risk Sir Eustace. \"Mrs. Blair, for one,\" I said lightly. \"A acquaintance of mine with whom I am staying.\" \"I think not,\" said my captor, craftily shaking his orangish head. \"You get not seen her since 11 this morning. And you received our note, tender you come here, at lunch-time.\" His words showed me how intimately my movements had been followed, but I was not going to give in without a fight. \"You are really clever,\" I said. \"Perhaps you get heard of that utilitarian invention, the telephone? Mrs. Blair called me up on it when I was resting in my way after lunch. I told her so where I was going this afternoon.\" To my outstanding satisfaction, I saw a tint of unease pass over his face. Clearly he had overlooked the hypothesis that Suzanne might have telephoned to me. I wished she really had done so! \"Enough of this,\" he said harshly, rising. \"What are you going to do with me?\" I asked, even endeavouring to appear composed. \"Put you where you can do no damage in example your friends come after you.\" For a bit my origin ran cold, but his future words reassured me. \"To-morrow you'll have some questions to answer, and after you've answered them we shall know what to do with you. And I can tell you, youth lady, we've more ways than one of making obdurate small fools talk.\" It was not cheering, but it was at least a respite."}, {"label": "Christie", "text": "He has solved many cases that get totally baffled the English police.\" \"Bah! The English police!\" Giraud snapped his fingers disdainfully. \"They must be on a point with our examining magistrates. So he has gone to Paris, has he? Well, a good thing. The yearn he stays there, the better. But what does he think he will find there?\" I thought I say in the question a undertone of uneasiness. I drew myself up. \"That I am not at autonomy to say,\" I said quietly. Giraud subjected me to a penetrating stare. \"He has likely plenty feel not to tell _you___,\" he remarked rudely. \"Good afternoon. I'm busy.\" And with that, he turned on his heel, and remaining me without ceremony. Matters seemed at a impasse at the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve. Giraud apparently did not desire my party and, from what I had seen, it seemed somewhat sure that Jack Renauld did not either. I went second to the town, had an pleasurable tub and returned to the hotel. I turned in early, wondering whether the next day would bring ahead anything of interest. I was entirely unprepared for what it did bring forth. I was eating my petit d\u00e9jeuner in the dining-room, when the waiter, who had been talking to some one outside, came second in obvious excitement. He hesitated for a minute, fidgeting with his napkin, and so burst out. \"Monsieur will pardon me, but he is connected, is he not, with the matter at the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve?' \"Yes,\" I said eagerly. \"Why?\" \"Monsieur has not heard the news, though?\" \"What news?\" \"That there has been another slaying there finally night!\" \"_What?___\" Leaving my breakfast, I caught up my hat and ran as quick as I could. Another murder\u2014and Poirot away! What fatality. But who had been murdered? I dashed in at the gate. A radical of the servants was in the drive, talking and gesticulating. I caught keep of Fran\u00e7oise. \"What has happened?\" \"Oh, monsieur! monsieur! Another death! It is terrible. There is a torment upon the house. But yes, I say it, a curse! They should send for M. le cur\u00e9 to bring some sanctum water. Never will I sleep another dark under that roof. It might be my turn, who knows?\" She crossed herself. \"Yes,\" I cried, \"but who has been killed?\" \"Do I know\u2014me? A man\u2014a stranger. They found him up there\u2014in the shed\u2014not a 100 yards from where they found inadequate Monsieur. And that is not all. He is stabbed\u2014stabbed to the spirit _with the like dagger!___\" Waiting for no more, I turned and ran up the route to the shed. The two men on safety there stood apart to let me pass and, filled with excitement, I entered. The illumination was dim, the spot was a bare bumpy wooden erecting to keep old pots and tools in. I had entered impetuously, but on the door I checked myself, fascinated by the spectacle before me. Giraud was on his hands and knees, a pouch flashlight in his give with which he was examining every edge of the ground. He looked up with a scowl at my entrance, so his look relaxed a small in a kind of good-humoured contempt. \"Ah, _c'est l'Anglais!___ Enter then. Let us see what you can make of this affair.\" Rather irritated by his tone, I stooped my head, and passed in. \"There he is,\" said Giraud, flashing his flashlight to the far corner. I stepped across. The abruptly man lay flat upon his back. He was of intermediate height, dusky of complexion, and perhaps about 50 years of age. He was neatly dressed in a dark dark suit, good cut and likely made by an expensive tailor, but not new. His look was awfully convulsed, and on his left side, but over the heart, the hilt of a obelisk stood up, dark and shining. I recognized it. It was the like obelisk I had seen reposing in the glaze jar the preceding morning! \"I'm expecting the physician any minute,\" explained Giraud. \"Although we barely need him. There's no doubt what the man died of. He was stabbed to the heart, and dying must get been fairly good instantaneous.\" \"When was it done? finally night?\" Giraud shook his head. \"Hardly. I don't lay low the law on checkup evidence, but the man's been suddenly well over twelve hours. When do you say you finally saw that dagger?\" \"About ten o'clock yesterday morning.\" \"Then I should be inclined to fix the law-breaking as being done not yearn after that.\" \"But people were passing and repassing this shed continually.\" Giraud laughed disagreeably. \"You advancement to a marvel! Who told you he was killed in this shed?\" \"Well I felt flustered. \"I\u2014I assumed it.\" \"Oh, what a OK detective! Look at him, _mon petit___\u2014does a man stabbed to the spirit autumn like that\u2014neatly with his feet together, and his arms to his side? No. Again does a man lie down on his second and allow himself to be stabbed without raising a give to defend himself? It is absurd, is it not? But see here\u2014and here He flashed the flashlight along the ground. I saw odd unpredictable marks in the delicate dirt. \"He was dragged here after he was dead. Half dragged, half carried by two people. Their tracks do not show on the tough soil outside, and here they get been deliberate to obliterate them\u2014but one of the two was a woman, my youth friend.\" \"A woman?\" \"Yes.\" \"But if the tracks are obliterated, how do you know?\" \"Because, blurred as they are, the prints of the woman's skid are unmistakable. Also, by _this___ And, leaning forward, he drew something from the grip of the obelisk and held it up for me to see. It was a woman's long black hair\u2014similar to the one Poirot had taken from the arm-chair in the library. With a somewhat wry grin he wound it round the obelisk again. \"We will leave things as they are as lots as possible,\" he explained. \"It pleases the examining magistrate. _Eh bien___, do you notice anything else?\" I was forced to shake my head. \"Look at his hands.\" I did. The nails were broken and discoloured, and the peel was hard. It barely enlightened me as lots as I should have liked it to have done. I looked up at Giraud. \"They are not the hands of a gentleman,\" he said, answering my look. \"On the perverse his clothes are those of a well-to-do man. That is curious, is it not?\" \"Very curious,\" I agreed. \"And none of his apparel is marked. What do we learn from that? This man was trying to pass himself off as former than he was. He was masquerading. Why? Did he fear something? Was he trying to escape by disguising himself? As yet we do not know, but one matter we do know\u2014he was as nervous to conceal his individuality as we are to discover it.\" He looked down at the torso again. \"As before there are no finger-prints on the grip of the dagger. The manslayer again wore gloves.\" \"You think, then, that the manslayer was the like in both cases?\" I asked eagerly. Giraud became inscrutable. \"Never idea what I think. We shall see. Marchaud!\" The _sergent de ville___ appeared at the doorway. \"Monsieur?\" \"Why is Madame Renauld not here? I sent for her a fourth of an minute ago?\" \"She is coming up the route now, monsieur, and her son with her.\" \"Good. I just want one at a time, though.\" Marchaud saluted and disappeared again. A bit after he reappeared with Mrs. Renauld. \"Here is Madame.\" Giraud came forward with a brusque bow. \"This way, madame.\" He led her across, and then, standing suddenly aside. \"Here is the man. Do you know him?\" And as he spoke, his eyes, gimlet-like, bored into her face, seeking to read her mind, noting every reading of her manner. But Mrs. Renauld remained absolutely calm\u2014too Nadina shook her head. \"No, no, that is not the way of it. Listen, my friend, to-morrow I go to London.\" \"But your sign here?\" \"I shall be out just one night. And I go incognito, like Royalty. No one will always know that I have left France. And why do you think that I go?\" \"Hardly for delight at this clock of year. January, a abominable misty"}, {"label": "Christie", "text": "Sir James nodded again. \"You feel--as we all feel-- _the bearing of Mr. Bown_. Yes\"--as Tuppence made a movement--\"not a question of it-- _Mr. Brown is here_....\" \"In this house?\" \"In this room.... You don't understand? _I am Mr. Brown_....\" Stupefied, unbelieving, they stared at him. The really lines of his look had changed. It was a unlike man who stood before them. He smiled a sluggish vicious smile. \"Neither of you will leave this way alive! You said but now we had succeeded. _I_ get succeeded! The outline pact is mine.\" His grin grew broad as he looked at Tuppence. \"Shall I say you how it will be? Sooner or after the patrol will break in, and they will find three victims of Mr. Brown--three, not two, you understand, but luckily the 3rd will not be dead, but wounded, and will be able to describe the assault with a riches of detail! The treaty? It is in the hands of Mr. Brown. So no one will think of searching the pockets of Sir James Peel Edgerton!\" He turned to Jane. \"You outwitted me. I give my acknowledgments. But you will not do it again.\" There was a feeble audio behind him, but, intoxicated with success, he did not turn his head. He slipped his give into his pocket. \"Checkmate to the Young Adventurers,\" he said, and slow raised the big automatic. But, even as he did so, he felt himself seized from behind in a handle of iron. The revolver was wrenched from his hand, and the sound of Julius Hersheimmer said drawlingly: \"I think you're caught redhanded with the goods upon you.\" The origin rushed to the K.C. 's face, but his self-control was marvellous, as he looked from one to the former of his two captors. He looked longest at Tommy. \"You,\" he said beneath his breath. \"_You!_ I might get known.\" Seeing that he was disposed to offer no resistance, their handle slackened. Quick as a blink his remaining hand, the give which bore the big signet ring, was raised to his lips.... \"\u2018_Ave, C\u00e6sar! te morituri salutant_,'\" he said, even looking at Tommy. so his look changed, and with a yearn spasmodic shiver he fell ahead in a dented heap, whilst an odor of acrid almonds filled the air. THE supper company given by Mr. Julius Hersheimmer to a few friends on the eve of the 30th will yearn be remembered in catering circles. It took spot in a individual room, and Mr. Hersheimmer's orders were abbreviated and forcible. He gave menu blanche--and when a millionaire gives menu blanche he normally gets it! Every finesse out of flavor was punctually provided. Waiters carried bottles of antediluvian and imperial vintage with loving care. The flowered decorations defied the seasons, and fruits of the world as far aside as May and November found themselves miraculously look by side. The name of guests was little and select. The American Ambassador, Mr. Carter, who had taken the liberty, he said, of bringing an old friend, Sir William Beresford, with him, Archdeacon Cowley, Dr. Hall, those two youth adventurers, Miss Prudence Cowley and Mr. Thomas Beresford, and last, but not least, as invitee of honour, Miss Jane Finn. Julius had spared no pains to make Jane's appearance a success. A mystical whack had brought Tuppence to the door of the flat she was sharing with the American girl. It was Julius. In his give he held a cheque. \"Say, Tuppence,\" he began, \"will you do me a good turn? Take this, and get Jane regularly togged up for this evening. You're all coming to supper with me at the _Savoy_. See? Spare no expense. You get me?\" \"Sure thing,\" mimicked Tuppence. \"We shall enjoy ourselves. It will be a delight dressing Jane. She's the loveliest matter I've ever seen.\" \"That's so,\" agreed Mr. Hersheimmer fervently. His fervor brought a fleeting sparkle to Tuppence's eye. \"By the way, Julius,\" she remarked demurely, \"I--haven't given you my reply yet.\" \"Answer?\" said Julius. His face paled. \"You know--when you need me to--marry you,\" faltered Tuppence, her eyes dispirited in the honest way of the former prim heroine, \"and wouldn't take no for an answer. I've thought it well over----\" \"Yes?\" said Julius. The sweat stood on his forehead. Tuppence relented suddenly. \"You outstanding idiot!\" she said. \"What on world induced you to do it? I could see at the clock you didn't care a twopenny dip for me!\" \"Not at all. I had--and still have--the highest sentiments of appreciation and respect--and admiration for you----\" \"H'm!\" said Tuppence. \"Those are the sort of sentiments that really shortly go to the fence when the former opinion comes along! Don't they, old thing?\" \"I don't know what you mean,\" said Julius stiffly, but a big and burning crimson overspread his countenance. \"Shucks!\" retorted Tuppence. She laughed, and closed the door, reopening it to add with dignity: \"Morally, I shall always consider I have been jilted!\" \"What was it?\" asked Jane as Tuppence rejoined her. \"Julius.\" \"What did he want?\" \"Really, I think, he wanted to see you, but I wasn't going to let him. Not until to-night, when you're going to burst upon every one like King Solomon in his glory! Come on! _We're going to shop!_\" To most people the 29th, the much-heralded \"Labour Day,\" had passed lots as any former day. Speeches were made in the Park and Trafalgar Square. Straggling processions, singing the _Red Flag_, wandered through the streets in a more or less directionless manner. Newspapers which had hinted at a universal strike, and the inaugural of a rule of terror, were forced to hide their diminished heads. The bold and more shrewd among them sought to prove that serenity had been effected by following their counsels. In the Sunday papers a abbreviated note of the sudden dying of Sir James Peel Edgerton, the famed K.C., had appeared. Monday's report contend gratefully with the suddenly man's career. The precise way of his sudden dying was ne'er made public. Tommy had been good in his predict of the situation. It had been a one-man show. Deprived of their chief, the organisation fell to pieces. Kramenin had made a precipitous refund to Russia, leaving England other on Sunday morning. The mob had fled from Astley Priors in a panic, leaving behind, in their haste, several damaging documents which compromised them hopelessly. With these proofs of cabal in their hands, aided encourage by a little brown journal taken from the pouch of the suddenly man which had contained a entire and damning r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the all plot, the Government had called an eleventh-hour conference. The Labour leaders were forced to recognize that they had been used as a cat's paw. Certain concessions were made by the Government, and were eagerly accepted. It was to be Peace, not War! But the Cabinet love by how constrict a border they had escaped pure disaster. And fire in on Mr. Carter's mind was the unusual picture which had taken spot in the home in Soho the dark before. He had entered the sordid way to find that outstanding man, the acquaintance of a lifetime, dead--betrayed out of his own mouth. From the suddenly man's pocket-book he had retrieved the ill-omened outline treaty, and so and there, in the bearing of the other three, it had been reduced to ashes.... England was saved! And now, on the eve of the 30th, in a individual way at the _Savoy_, Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer was receiving his guests. Mr. Carter was the beginning to arrive. With him was a choleric-looking old gentleman, at vision of whom Tommy flushed up to the roots of his hair. He came forward. \"Ha!\" said the old gentleman, surveying him apoplectically. \"So you're my nephew, are you? Not lots to look at--but you've done good work, it seems. Your father must have brought you up well after all. Shall we let bygones be bygones, eh? You're my heir, you know; and in next I suggest to make you an allowance--and you can look upon Chalmers Park as your home.\" \"Thank you, sir, it's terribly enough of you.\" \"Where's this youth madam I've been hearing such a lot about?\" Tommy introduced Tuppence. \"Ha!\" said Sir William, eyeing her. \"Girls aren't what they used to be in my young days.\" \"Yes, they are,\" said Tuppence.

There were times when I envied Emily, our small servant, who \"walked out\" whenever affair offered with a big crewman to whom she was affianced. In between times, to \"keep her give in\" as she expressed it, she walked out with the greengrocer's youth man, and the chemist's assistant. I reflected woefully that I had no one to \"keep my give in\" with. All Papa's friends were aged Professors\u2014usually with yearn beards. It is honest that Professor Peterson formerly clasped me dearly and said I had a \"neat small waist\" and so tried to kiss me. The word only dated him hopelessly. No self-respecting female has had a \"neat small waist\" since I was in my cradle. I yearned for adventure, for love, for romance, and I seemed condemned to an universe of dreary utility. The hamlet possessed a loan library, entire of tattered works of fiction, and I know perils and love-making at 2nd hand, and went to sleep dreaming of stern, mute Rhodesians, and of solid men who ever \"felled their opposing with a one blow.\" There was no one in the hamlet who still looked as though he could \"fell\" an opponent, with a one suck or with several. There was the Kinema too, with a weekly installment of \"The Perils of Pamela.\" Pamela was a splendid youth woman. Nothing daunted her. She fell out of aeroplanes, adventured in submarines, climbed skyscrapers and crept some in the Underworld without turning a hair. She was not actually clever, the Master Criminal of the Underworld caught her each time, but as he seemed averse to knock her on the chief in a uncomplicated way, and ever doomed her to dying in a sewer-gas chamber or by some new and wondrous means, the fighter was ever able to rescue her at the start of the next week's episode. I used to come out with my chief in a hallucinating whirl\u2014and so I would get house and find a note from the Gas Company threatening to cut us off if the outstanding invoice was not paid! And yet, though I did not suspect it, every bit was take escapade closer to me. It is potential that there are many people in the globe who get ne'er heard of the discover of an old-fashioned skull at the Broken Hill Mine in Northern Rhodesia. I came low one morn to find Papa excited to the place of apoplexy. He poured out the all tale to me. \"You understand, Anne? There are undoubtedly sure resemblances to the Java skull, but superficial\u2014superficial only. No, here we get what I get ever maintained\u2014the hereditary sort of the Neanderthal race. You award that the Gibraltar skull is the most archaic of the Neanderthal skulls found? Why? The rocker of the run was in Africa. They passed to Europe\u2014 \"Not marmalade on kippers, papa,\" I said hastily, arresting my parent's absent-minded hand. \"Yes, you were saying?\" \"They passed to Europe on\u2014 Here he broke down with a bad fit of choking, the consequence of an immoderate taste of kipper-bones. \"But we must start at once,\" he declared, as he rose to his feet at the decision of the meal. \"There is no clock to be lost. We must be on the spot\u2014there are doubtless incalculable finds to be found in the neighbourhood. I shall be concerned to note whether the implements are distinctive of the Mousterian period\u2014there will be the remains of the archaic ox, I should say, but not those of the addled rhinoceros. Yes, a small USA will be starting soon. We must get forward of them. You will write to Cook's to-day, Anne?\" \"What about money, papa?\" I hinted delicately. He turned a reproving eye upon me. \"Your place of perspective ever depresses me, my child. We must not be sordid. No, no, in the argue of skill one must not be sordid.\" \"I sense Cook's might be sordid, papa.\" Papa looked pained. \"My darling Anne, you will pay them in prepare money.\" \"I haven't got any prepare money.\" Papa looked exhaustively exasperated. \"My child, I actually cannot be bothered with these uncouth money details. The bank\u2014I had something from the Manager yesterday, saying I had twenty-seven pounds.\" \"That's your overdraft, I fancy.\" \"Ah, I get it! Write to my publishers.\" I acquiesced doubtfully, Papa's books bringing in more glorification than money. I liked the thought of going to Rhodesia immensely. \"Stern mute men,\" I murmured to myself in an ecstasy. so something in my parent's appearing struck me as unusual. \"You get odd boots on, papa,\" I said. \"Take off the brown one and put on the former dark one. And don't forget your muffler. It's a really frigid day.\" In a few minutes Papa stalked off, right booted and well mufflered. He returned recent that evening, and, to my dismay, I saw his silencer and greatcoat were missing. \"Dear me, Anne, you are rather right. I took them off to go into the cavern. One gets so filthy there.\" I nodded feelingly, remembering an affair when Papa had returned literally plastered from chief to ft with deep Pleiocene clay. Our chief reason for settling in Little Hampsly had been the neighborhood of Hampsly Cavern, a buried spelunk deep in deposits of the Aurignacian culture. We had a petite Museum in the village, and the conservator and Papa spent most of their days messing about subway and bringing to illumination portions of addled rhinoceros and spelunk bear. Papa coughed poorly all the evening, and the next morn I saw he had a temperature and mail for the doctor. Poor Papa, he ne'er had a chance. It was two-bagger pneumonia. He died four days later. Every one was really sort to me. Dazed as I was, I appreciated that. I felt no overpowering grief. Papa had ne'er loved me, I knew that well enough. If he had, I might have loved him in return. No, there had not been know between us, but we had belonged together, and I had looked after him, and had secretly admired his teach and his inflexible veneration to science. And it hurt me that Papa should have died just when the concern of living was at its elevation for him. I should have felt happier if I could have buried him in a cave, with paintings of caribou and stony implements, but the push of world judgement constrained a nifty grave (with marble slab) in our horrid local churchyard. The vicar's consolations, though well meant, did not console me in the least. It took some clock to dawn upon me that the matter I had always longed for\u2014freedom\u2014was at finally mine. I was an orphan, and lots penniless, but free. At the like clock I realized the over-the-top benignity of all these good people. The vicar did his best to persuade me that his wife was in pressing want of a accompany help. Our petite local library abruptly made up its idea to have an adjunct librarian. Finally, the physician called upon me, and after making several absurd excuses for failing to send in a right bill, he hummed and hawed a good bargain and abruptly suggested that I should marry him. I was really much astonished. The physician was nearer 40 than thirty, and a round, pudgy small man. He was not at all like the fighter of \"The Perils of Pamela,\" and still less like a austere and mute Rhodesian. I reflected a hour and so asked him why he wanted to marry me. That seemed to fluster him a good deal, and he murmured that a wife was a great assist to a General Practitioner. The spot seemed still more unromantic than before, and yet something in me urged towards its acceptance. Safety, that was what I was being offered. Safety\u2014and a comfy Home. Thinking it over now, I think I did the small man an injustice. He was frankly in know with me, but a misguided finesse prevented him from pressing his fit on those lines. Anyway, my love of romanticism rebelled. \"It's highly kind of you,\" I said. \"But it's impossible. I could ne'er marry a man unless I loved him madly.\" \"You don't think\u2014\u2014?\" \"No, I don't,\" I said firmly. He sighed. \"But, my darling child,"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "do mr turner and miss lee think that they feel a i do this be a pick crew men the turner line have employ for year you be very

sometimes i suspect barrymore of be a domestic tyrant i have always felt that there be something singular and questionable in this man character but the adventure of last night bring all my suspicion to a head and yet it may seem a small matter in itself you be aware that i be not a very sound sleeper and since i have be on guard in this house my slumber have be lighter than ever last night about

a candle hold in his hand he be in shirt and trouser with no cover to his foot i could merely see the outline but his height tell me that it be barrymore he walk very slowly and circumspectly and there be something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance i have tell you that the corridor be break by the balcony which run round the hall but that it be resume upon the farther side i wait until he have pas out of sight and then i follow him when i come round the balcony he have reach the end of the farther corridor and i could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he have enter one of the room now all these room be unfurnished and unoccupied so that his expedition become more mysterious than ever the light shine steadily a if he be stand motionless i creep down the passage a noiselessly a i could and peep round the corner of the door barrymore be crouch at the window with the candle hold against the glass his profile be half turn towards me and his face seem to be rigid with expectation a he star out into the blackness of the moor for some minute he stand watch intently then he give a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the

somewhere in a lock but i could not tell whence the sound come what it all mean i cannot guess but there be some secret business go on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the

during the early day of my mission you must acknowledge that i be make up for lose time and that event be now crowd thick and fast upon u in my last report i end upon my top note with barrymore at the window and now i have quite a budget already which will unless i be much mistake considerably surprise you thing have take a turn which i could not have anticipate in some way they have within the last forty eight hour become much clearer and in some way they have become more complicate but i will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself before breakfast on the morning follow my adventure i go down the corridor and examine the room in which barrymore have be on the night before the western window through which he have star so intently have i notice one peculiarity above all other window in the house it command the nearest outlook on to the moor there be an open between two tree which enable one from this point of view to look right down upon it while from all the other window it be only a distant glimpse which can be obtain it follow therefore that barrymore since only this window would serve the purpose must have be look out for something or somebody upon the moor the night be very dark so that i can hardly imagine how he could have hop to see anyone it have strike me that it be possible that some love intrigue be on foot that would have account for his stealthy movement and also for the uneasiness of his wife the man be a striking looking fellow very well equip to steal the heart of a country girl so that this theory seem to have something to support it that open of the door which i have hear after i have return to my room might mean that he have go out to keep some clandestine appointment so i reason with myself in the morning and i tell you the direction of my suspicion however much the result may have show that they be unfounded but whatever the true explanation of barrymore movement might be i felt that the responsibility of keep them to myself until i could explain them be more than i could bear i have an interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast and i tell him all that i have see he be le surprise than i have expect i know that barrymore walk about night and i have a mind to speak to him about it say he two or three time i have hear his step in the passage come and go just about the hour you name perhaps then he pay a visit every night to that particular window i suggest perhaps he do if so we should be able to shadow him and see what it be that he be after i wonder what your friend holmes would do if he be here i believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest say i he would follow barrymore and see what he do then we shall do it together but surely he would hear u the man be rather deaf and in

halsey know the the murder man do he but mr jamieson be sure of his grind the quarrel i believe he persist be about mr armstrong conduct to you miss gertrude he have be pay you unwelcome attention and i have never see the man when she nod a yes i saw the tremendous possibility involve if this detective could prove that gertrude fear and dislike the murder man and that mr armstrong have be annoy and possibly pursue her with hateful attention all that add to gertrudes confession of her presence in the billiard room at the time of the crime look strange to say the least the prominence of the family assure a strenuous effort to find the murderer and if we have nothing worse to look forward to we be sure of a distasteful publicity mr jamieson shut his note book with a snap and thank u i have an idea he say apropos of nothing at all that at any rate the ghost be lay here whatever the rappings have be and the color man say they begin when the family go west three month ago they be likely to

Inglethorp get made a will in her favour?\" Poirot shook his head. \"But you yourself suggested that hypothesis to Mr. Wells?\" Poirot smiled. \"That was for a reason. I did not need to mention the list of the someone who was actually in my mind. Miss Howard occupied actually lots the like position, so I used her list instead.\" \"Still, Mrs. Inglethorp might get done so. Why, that will, made on the afternoon of her dying may\u2014 But Poirot's stir of the chief was so industrious that I stopped. \"No, my friend. I get sure small ideas of my own about that will. But I can say you this much\u2014it was not in Miss Howard's favour.\" I accepted his assurance, though I did not really see how he could be so confident about the matter. \"Well,\" I said, with a sigh, \"we will acquit Miss Howard, then. It is part your blame that I always came to suspect her. It was what you said about her prove at the inquest that set me off.\" Poirot looked puzzled. \"What did I say about her prove at the inquest?\" \"Don't you remember? When I cited her and John Cavendish as being above suspicion?\" \"Oh\u2014ah\u2014yes.\" He seemed a small confused, but recovered himself. \"By the way, Hastings, there is something I need you to do for me.\" \"Certainly. What is it?\" \"Next clock you occur to be only with Lawrence Cavendish, I want you to say this to him. \u2018I get a content for you, from Poirot. He says: \"Find the additional coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace!\"' zero more. Nothing less.\" \"\u2018Find the additional coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.' Is that right?\" I asked, lots mystified. \"Excellent.\" \"But what does it mean?\" \"Ah, that I will leave you to find out. You get admission to the facts. Just say that to him, and see what he says.\" \"Very well\u2014but it's all highly mysterious.\" We were running into Tadminster now, and Poirot directed the car to the \"Analytical Chemist.\" Poirot hopped low briskly, and went inside. In a few minutes he was second again. \"There,\" he said. \"That is all my business.\" \"What were you doing there?\" I asked, in brisk curiosity. \"I left something to be analysed.\" \"Yes, but what?\" \"The try of cocoa I took from the saucepan in the bedroom.\" \"But that has already been tested!\" I cried, stupefied. \"Dr. Bauerstein had it tested, and you yourself laughed at the hypothesis of there being strychnine in it.\" \"I love Dr. Bauerstein had it tested,\" replied Poirot quietly. \"Well, then?\" \"Well, I get a see for having it analysed again, that is all.\" And not another phrase on the subject could I pull out of him. This continue of Poirot's, in regard of the cocoa, puzzled me intensely. I could see neither rhyme nor argue in it. However, my trust in him, which at one clock had instead waned, was entire restored since his notion in Alfred Inglethorp's purity had been so triumphantly vindicated. The funeral of Mrs. Inglethorp took spot the next day, and on Monday, as I came low to a recent breakfast, John drew me aside, and informed me that Mr. Inglethorp was leaving that morning, to take up his quarters at the Stylites Arms until he should have completed his plans. \"And really it's a outstanding reliever to think he's going, Hastings,\" continued my good friend. \"It was bad plenty before, when we thought he'd done it, but I'm hanged if it isn't worse now, when we all sense shamed for having been so low on the fellow. The fact is, we've treated him abominably. Of course, things did look dark against him. I don't see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we did. Still, there it is, we were in the wrong, and now there's a bestial feeling that one ought to give amends; which is difficult, when one doesn't like the colleague a bit better than one did before. The all thing's damned awkward! And I'm grateful he's had the tact to take himself off. It's a good matter Styles wasn't the mater's to leave to him. Couldn't bear to think of the colleague lording it here. He's receive to her money.\" \"You'll be able to keep up the spot all right?\" I asked. \"Oh, yes. There are the dying duties, of course, but half my father's money goes with the place, and Lawrence will stay with us for the present, so there is his deal as well. We shall be pinched at first, of course, because, as I formerly told you, I am in a bit of a hollow financially myself. Still, the Johnnies will expect now.\" In the universal reliever at Inglethorp's approaching departure, we had the most amiable breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy. Cynthia, whose youth spirits were course buoyant, was looking instead her fairly ego again, and we all, with the exclusion of Lawrence, who seemed immutably dreary and nervous, were softly cheerful, at the gap of a new and promising future. The papers, of course, had been entire of the tragedy. Glaring headlines, sandwiched biographies of every appendage of the household, insidious innuendoes, the common fellow tag about the patrol having a clue. Nothing was spared us. It was a loose time. The war was momentarily inactive, and the newspapers seized with eagerness on this law-breaking in stylish life: \"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\" was the topic of the moment. Naturally it was really annoying for the Cavendishes. The home was incessantly besieged by reporters, who were systematically denied admission, but who continued to haunt the hamlet and the grounds, where they lay in wait with cameras, for any unwary members of the household. We all lived in a blow of publicity. The Scotland Yard men came and went, examining, questioning, lynx-eyed and reserved of tongue. Towards what end they were working, we did not know. Had they any clue, or would the all matter continue in the course of unexplored crimes? After breakfast, Dorcas came up to me rather mysteriously, and asked if she might have a few words with me. \"Certainly. What is it, Dorcas?\" \"Well, it's but this, sir. You'll be seeing the Belgian man to-day perhaps?\" I nodded. \"Well, sir, you love how he asked me so specific if the mistress, or anyone else, had a park dress?\" \"Yes, yes. You have found one?\" My concern was aroused. \"No, not that, sir. But since so I've remembered what the youth gentlemen\"\u2014John and Lawrence were even the \"young gentlemen\" to Dorcas call the \u2018dressing-up box.' It's up in the look attic, sir. A outstanding chest, entire of old clothes and see dresses, and what not. And it came to me sudden like that there might be a park attire amongst them. So, if you'd tell the Belgian gentleman\u2014 \"I will tell him, Dorcas,\" I promised. \"Thank you really much, sir. A really decent man he is, sir. And rather a unlike class from them two detectives from London, what goes prying about, and asking questions. I don't hold with foreigners as a rule, but from what the newspapers say I make out as how these courageous Belges isn't the average run of foreigners, and surely he's a most civilized talk gentleman.\" Dear old Dorcas! As she stood there, with her honest face upturned to mine, I thought what a OK specimen she was of the old-fashioned handmaid that is so quick dying out. I thought I might as well go down to the hamlet at once, and look up Poirot; but I met him half-way, coming up to the house, and at formerly gave him Dorcas's message. \"Ah, the courageous Dorcas! We will look at the chest, although\u2014but no matter\u2014we will examine it all the same.\" We entered the home by one of the windows. There was no one in the hall, and we went flat up to the attic. Sure enough, there was the chest, a OK old piece, all studded with plaque nails, and full to overflowing with every conceivable character of garment. Poirot bundled everything out on the deck with skimp ceremony. There were one or two park fabrics of varying shades; but Poirot shook his chief over them all. He seemed"}, {"label": "Christie", "text": "\"I've forgotten his list now,\" confessed Tuppence. \"To resume, that was in a way the acme of my career. I future entered a Government office. We had various really pleasurable tea parties. I had intended to become a acres girl, a postwoman, and a bus conductress by way of rounding off my career--but the Armistice intervened! I clung to the bureau with the honest limpet hint for many yearn months, but, alas, I was combed out at last. Since so I've been looking for a job. Now then--your turn.\" \"There's not so lots publicity in mine,\" said Tommy regretfully, \"and a outstanding bargain less variety. I went out to France again, as you know. so they sent me to Mesopotamia, and I got wounded for the 2nd time, and went into infirmary out there. so I got stuck in Egypt till the Armistice happened, kicked my heels there some clock longer, and, as I told you, eventually got demobbed. And, for ten long, fatigue months I've been job hunting! There aren't any jobs! And, if there were, they wouldn't give \u2018em to me. What good am I? What do I love about business? Nothing.\" Tuppence nodded gloomily. \"What about the colonies?\" she suggested. Tommy shook his head. \"I shouldn't like the colonies--and I'm absolutely sure they wouldn't like me!\" \"Rich relations?\" Again Tommy shook his head. \"Oh, Tommy, not still a great-aunt?\" \"I've got an old uncle who's more or less rolling, but he's no good.\" \"Why not?\" \"Wanted to adopt me once. I refused.\" \"I guess I guess hearing about it,\" said Tuppence slowly. \"You refused because of your mother----\" Tommy flushed. \"Yes, it would get been a bit bumpy on the mater. As you know, I was all she had. Old boy hated her--wanted to get me out from her. Just a bit of spite.\" \"Your mother's dead, isn't she?\" said Tuppence gently. Tommy nodded. Tuppence's big grey eyes looked misty. \"You're a good sort, Tommy. I always knew it.\" \"Rot!\" said Tommy hastily. \"Well, that's my position. I'm but about desperate.\" \"So am I! I've hung out as yearn as I could. I've touted round. I've answered advertisements. I've tried every soul blessed thing. I've screwed and saved and pinched! But it's no good. I shall get to go home!\" \"Don't you need to?\" \"Of class I don't need to! What's the well of being sentimental? Father's a dear--I'm terribly affectionate of him--but you've no thought how I trouble him! He has that delicious former prim perspective that little skirts and fume are immoral. You can imagine what a prickle in the shape I am to him! He but heaved a sigh of reliever when the war took me off. You see, there are seven of us at home. It's awful! All housekeeping and mothers' meetings! I get ever been the changeling. I don't need to go back, but--oh, Tommy, what else is there to do?\" Tommy shook his chief sadly. There was a silence, and so Tuppence explode out: \"Money, money, money! I guess about money morning, midday and night! I presume say it's mercantile of me, but there it is!\" \"Same here,\" agreed Tommy with feeling. \"I've thought over every conceivable way of getting it too,\" continued Tuppence. \"There are just three! To be left it, to marry it, or to make it. First is ruled out. I haven't got any deep older relatives. Any relatives I get are in homes for rotted gentlewomen! I ever assist old ladies over crossings, and pick up parcels for old gentlemen, in example they should turn out to be oddball millionaires. But not one of them has ever asked me my name--and instead a lot ne'er said \u2018Thank you.'\" There was a pause. \"Of course,\" resumed Tuppence, \"marriage is my best chance. I made up my idea to marry money when I was instead young. Any guess daughter would! I'm not sentimental, you know.\" She paused. \"Come now, you can't say I'm sentimental,\" she added sharply. \"Certainly not,\" agreed Tommy hastily. \"No one would ever think of opinion in connector with you.\" \"That's not really polite,\" replied Tuppence. \"But I presume say you think it all right. Well, there it is! I'm prepare and willing--but I ne'er fulfill any deep men! All the boys I love are about as tough up as I am.\" \"What about the general?\" inquired Tommy. \"I see he keeps a bike store in clock of peace,\" explained Tuppence. \"No, there it is! Now _you_ could marry a deep girl.\" \"I'm like you. I don't know any.\" \"That doesn't matter. You can ever get to know one. Now, if I see a man in a fur surface come out of the _Ritz_ I can't rush up to him and say: \u2018Look here, you're rich. I'd like to know you.'\" \"Do you indicate that I should do that to a likewise garbed female?\" \"Don't be silly. You stride on her foot, or pick up her handkerchief, or something like that. If she thinks you want to know her she's flattered, and will manage it for you somehow.\" \"You overrate my virile charms,\" murmured Tommy. \"On the other hand,\" proceeded Tuppence, \"my millionaire would likely run for his life! No--marriage is pregnant with difficulties. Remains--to _make_ money!\" \"We've tried that, and failed,\" Tommy reminded her. \"We've tried all the orthodox ways, yes. But guess we try the unorthodox. Tommy, let's be adventurers!\" \"Certainly,\" replied Tommy cheerfully. \"How do we begin?\" \"That's the difficulty. If we could make ourselves known, people might hire us to commit crimes for them.\" \"Delightful,\" commented Tommy. \"Especially coming from a clergyman's daughter!\" \"The lesson guilt,\" Tuppence pointed out, \"would be theirs--not mine. You must admit that there's a deviation between theft a rhombus necklace for yourself and being hired to steal it.\" \"There wouldn't be the least deviation if you were caught!\" \"Perhaps not. But I shouldn't be caught. I'm so clever.\" \"Modesty always was your plague sin,\" remarked Tommy. \"Don't rag. Look here, Tommy, shall we really? Shall we kind a job partnership?\" \"Form a party for the stealing of rhombus necklaces?\" \"That was just an illustration. Let's have a--what do you call it in book-keeping?\" \"Don't know. Never did any.\" \"I have--but I always got blend up, and used to put note entries on the debit side, and vice versa--so they fired me out. Oh, I know--a articulation venture! It struck me as such a amorous word to come across in the halfway of moldy old figures. It's got an Elizabethan flavor about it--makes one think of galleons and doubloons. A articulation venture!\" \"Trading under the list of the Young Adventurers, Ltd.? Is that your idea, Tuppence?\" \"It's all really well to laugh, but I sense there might be something in it.\" \"How do you propose to get in hint with your would-be employers?\" \"Advertisement,\" replied Tuppence promptly. \"Have you got a bit of report and a pencil? Men normally appear to have. Just like we have hairpins and powder-puffs.\" Tommy handed over a rather tatty park notebook, and Tuppence began writing busily. \"Shall we begin: \u2018Young officer, double wounded in the war----'\" \"Certainly not.\" \"Oh, really well, my darling boy. But I can assure you that that kind of matter might touch the spirit of an older spinster, and she might adopt you, and so there would be no need for you to be a youth explorer at all.\" \"I don't want to be adopted.\" \"I leave you had a bias against it. I was just ragging you! The papers are entire up to the rim with that character of thing. Now listen--how's this? \u2018Two youth adventurers for hire. Willing to do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good.' (We might as well make that make from the start.) so we might add: \u2018No sensible provide refused'--like flats and furniture.\" \"I should think any provide we get in reply to that would be a fairly _un_reasonable one!\" \"Tommy! You're a genius! That's ever so lots more chic. \u2018No undue provide refused--if pay is good.' How's that?\" \"I shouldn't mention pay again. It looks rather eager.\" \"It couldn't see as bore as I feel! But possibly you are right. Now I'll say it straight through. \u2018Two youth adventurers for hire. Willing to do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good. No undue provide refused.'

The man was a fool--he had been incredibly, incredibly stupid. still the fluency of his advise was barely probably to save him. I felt an inestimable disdain for him.... so it occurred to me that the felon measure was a low one. It was the wastrels, the failures, the universal riff-raff of civilisation who drifted into crime.... Strange that men of brains had ne'er realized its over-the-top opportunities.... I played with the idea.... What a splendid field--what limitless possibilities! It made my mind reel.... \"... I say measure works on law-breaking and criminals. They all confirmed my opinion. Degeneracy, disease--never the careful adopt of a vocation by a far-seeing man. so I considered. Supposing my maximum ambitions were realized--that I was called to the bar, and rose to the elevation of my profession? That I entered politics--say, even, that I became Prime Minister of England? What then? Was that power? Hampered at every go by my colleagues, fettered by the popular scheme of which I should be the bare figurehead! No--the force I dreamed of was absolute! An autocrat! A dictator! And such force could just be obtained by working outside the law. To play on the weaknesses of man nature, so on the weaknesses of nations--to get unitedly and control a immense organization, and eventually to overthrow the existing order, and rule! The thought intoxicated me.... \"... I saw that I must lead two lives. A man like myself is bound to attract notice.

There was less raillery in his sound as he asked: \"You believe, then, in parentage and breeding?\" \"I may be old-fashioned, but I surely don't believe in marrying out of one's class. It ne'er answers.\" \"I concur with you, _mon ami___. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, it is as you say. But there is always the 100th time! Still, that does not arise, as you do not propose to see the madam again.\" His finally words were nearly a question, and I was mindful of the acuity with which he darted a glimpse at me. And before my eyes, writ big in letters of fire, I saw the words \"H\u00f4tel du Phare,\" and I heard again her sound saying \"Come and look me up\" and my own respond with _empressement___: \"I will.\" Well, what of it? I had think to go at the time. But since then, I had had clock to reflect. I did not like the girl. Thinking it over in frigid blood, I came unquestionably to the decision that I disliked her intensely. I had got hauled over the coals for unwisely gratifying her ghoulish curiosity, and I had not the least need to see her again. I answered Poirot gently enough. \"She asked me to look her up, but of class I shan't.\" \"Why \u2018of course'?\" \"Well\u2014I don't want to.\" \"I see.\" He studied me attentively for some minutes. \"Yes. I see really well. And you are wise. Stick to what you have said.\" \"That seems to be your constant advice,\" I remarked, rather piqued. \"Ah, my friend, have faith in Papa Poirot. Some day, if you permit, I will arrange you a wedlock of outstanding suitability.\" \"Thank you,\" I said laughing, \"but the chance leaves me cold.\" Poirot sighed and shook his head. \"_Les Anglais!___\" he murmured. \"No method\u2014absolutely none whatever.

I looked across at him, and felt reassured. He was cutting his dough into nifty small squares, totally absorbed in his task. He must have fancied I had told him where the daughter was staying. We had coffee outside facing the sea. Poirot smoked one of his petite cigarettes, and so drew his see from his pocket. \"The rail to Paris leaves at 2:25,\" he observed. \"I should be starting.\" \"Paris?\" I cried. \"That is what I said, _mon ami___.\" \"You are going to Paris? But why?\" He replied really seriously. \"To look for the manslayer of M. Renauld.\" \"You think he is in Paris?\" \"I am rather sure that he is not. Nevertheless, it is there that I must look for him. You do not understand, but I will explain it all to you in good time. Believe me, this travel to Paris is necessary. I shall not be out long.

His confront burned a deeper red. \"Shall we actually try it?\" he said at last. \"Shall we, Tuppence? Just for the fun of the thing?\" \"Tommy, you're a sport! I knew you would be! Let's drink to success.\" She poured some frigid dregs of tea into the two cups. \"Here's to our articulation venture, and may it prosper!\" \"The Young Adventurers, Ltd.!\" responded Tommy. They put down the cups and laughed instead uncertainly. Tuppence rose. \"I must return to my palatial rooms at the hostel.\" \"Perhaps it is clock I strolled circle to the _Ritz_,\" agreed Tommy with a grin. \"Where shall we meet? And when?\" \"Twelve o'clock to-morrow. Piccadilly Tube station. Will that fit you?\" \"My clock is my own,\" replied Mr. Beresford magnificently. \"So long, then.\" \"Good-bye, old thing.\" The two youth people went off in contrary directions. Tuppence's lodge was situated in what was charitably called Southern Belgravia. For reasons of saving she did not take a bus. She was half-way across St. James's Park, when a man's sound behind her made her start. \"Excuse me,\" it said. \"But may I speak to you for a moment?\" TUPPENCE turned sharply, but the words hovering on the tip of her spit remained unspoken, for the man's appearing and way did not bear out her beginning and most innate assumption. She hesitated. As if he read her thoughts, the man said quickly: \"I can assure you I guess no disrespect.\" Tuppence believed him. Although she disliked and distrusted him instinctively, she was inclined to acquit him of the specific motivation which she had at beginning attributed to him. She looked him up and down. He was a big man, neat shaven, with a hard jowl. His eyes were small and cunning, and shifted their glimpse under her send gaze. \"Well, what is it?\" she asked. The man smiled. \"I happened to overhear portion of your conversation with the youth man in Lyons'.\" \"Well--what of it?\" \"Nothing--except that I think I may be of some use to you.\" Another inference forced itself into Tuppence's mind: \"You followed me here?\" \"I took that liberty.\" \"And in what way do you think you could be of use to me?\" The man took a board from his pouch and handed it to her with a bow. Tuppence took it and scrutinized it carefully. It bore the inscription, \"Mr. Edward Whittington.\" Below the list were the words \"Esthonia Glassware Co.,\" and the phone of a metropolis office. Mr. Whittington talk again: \"If you will phone upon me to-morrow morn at 11 o'clock, I will lay the details of my proposal before you.\" \"At 11 o'clock?\" said Tuppence doubtfully. \"At 11 o'clock.\" Tuppence made up her mind. \"Very well. I'll be there.\" \"Thank you. Good evening.\" He raised his hat with a flourish, and walked away. Tuppence remained for some minutes gazing after him. so she gave a odd move of her shoulders, instead as a terrier shakes himself. \"The adventures get begun,\" she murmured to herself. \"What does he need me to do, I wonder? There's something some you, Mr. Whittington, that I don't like at all. But, on the former hand, I'm not the least bit afraid of you. And as I've said before, and shall doubtless say again, small Tuppence can look after herself, thank you!\" And with a short, crisp nod of her chief she walked briskly onward. As a consequence of encourage meditations, however, she turned apart from the send road and entered a send office. There she pondered for some moments, a wire kind in her hand. The guess of a potential five shillings spent unnecessarily spurred I should suggest that we call upon him there as shortly as possible. Shall we say after a tub and breakfast?\" It was arranged that Tuppence and Julius should return to the _Ritz_, and call for Sir James in the car. This program was reliably carried out, and a small after 11 they drew up before the _M\u00e9tropole_. They asked for Dr. Hall, and a page-boy went in lookup of him. In a few minutes the small physician came hurrying towards them. \"Can you extra us a few minutes, Dr. Hall?\" said Sir James pleasantly. \"Let me introduce you to Miss Cowley. Mr. Hersheimmer, I think, you already know.\" A mocking glint came into the doctor's eye as he shook hands with Julius. \"Ah, yes, my youth acquaintance of the corner episode! Ankle all right, eh?\" \"I guess it's cured owing to your adept treatment, doc.\" \"And the spirit trouble? Ha ha!\" \"Still searching,\" said Julius briefly. \"To do to the point, can we get a phrase with you in private?\" asked Sir James. \"Certainly. I think there is a way here where we shall be rather undisturbed.\" He led the way, and the others followed him. They sat down, and the physician looked inquiringly at Sir James. \"Dr. Hall, I am actually nervous to find a sure youth madam for the intent of obtaining a assertion from her. I get argue to believe that she has been at one clock or another in your institution at Bournemouth. I promise I am transgressing no pro etiquette in questioning you on the subject?\" \"I suppose it is a thing of testimony?\" Sir James hesitated a moment, so he replied: \"Yes.\" \"I shall be pleased to give you any info in my power. What is the youth lady's name? Mr. Hersheimmer asked me, I remember----\" He half turned to Julius. \"The name,\" said Sir James bluntly, \"is really immaterial. She would be nearly surely sent to you under an assume one. But I should like to love if you are acquainted with a Mrs. Vandemeyer?\" \"Mrs. Vandemeyer, of 20 South Audley Mansions? I know her slightly.\" \"You are not mindful of what has happened?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"You do not know that Mrs. Vandemeyer is dead?\" \"Dear, dear, I had no thought of it! When did it happen?\" \"She took an overdose of chloral finally night.\" \"Purposely?\" \"Accidentally, it is believed. I should not like to say myself. Anyway, she was found suddenly this morning.\" \"Very sad. A singularly fine-looking woman. I presume she was a acquaintance of yours, since you are acquainted with all these details.\" \"I am acquainted with the details because--well, it was I who found her dead.\" \"Indeed,\" said the doctor, starting. \"Yes,\" said Sir James, and stroked his mentum reflectively. \"This is really sad news, but you will excuse me if I say that I do not see how it bears on the topic of your inquiry?\" \"It bears on it in this way, is it not a fact that Mrs. Vandemeyer committed a youth relation of hers to your charge?\" Julius leaned ahead eagerly. \"That is the case,\" said the physician quietly. \"Under the list of----?\" \"Janet Vandemeyer. I realize her to be a niece of Mrs. Vandemeyer's.\" \"And she came to you?\" \"As far as I can remember in June or July of 1915.\" \"Was she a mental case?\" \"She is absolutely sane, if that is what you mean. I understood from Mrs. Vandemeyer that the daughter had been with her on the _Lusitania_ when that ill-fated transport was sunk, and had suffered a serious jolt in consequence.\" \"We're on the good track, I think?\" Sir James looked round. \"As I said before, I'm a mutt!\" returned Julius. The physician looked at them all curiously. \"You spoke of wanting a assertion from her,\" he said. \"Supposing she is not able to give one?\" \"What? You have but said that she is absolutely sane.\" \"So she is. Nevertheless, if you want a assertion from her concerning any events anterior to May 7, 1915, she will not be able to give it to you.\" They looked at the little man, stupefied. He nodded cheerfully. \"It's a pity,\" he said. \"A outstanding pity, particularly as I gather, Sir James, that the matter is important. But"}, {"label": "Christie", "text": "\"Well, possibly you're right. Minxes then--minxes now!\" \"That's it,\" said Tuppence. \"I'm a horrifying tease myself.\" \"I think you,\" said the old gentleman, chuckling, and pinched her ear in high good-humour. Most youth women were terrified of the \"old bear,\" as they termed him. Tuppence's perkiness delighted the old misogynist. so came the shy archdeacon, a small bewildered by the company in which he found himself, happy that his girl was considered to get distinguished herself, but ineffective to help glint at her from clock to clock with anxious apprehension. But Tuppence behaved admirably. She forbore to cross her legs, set a safety upon her tongue, and unwaveringly refused to smoke. Dr. Hall came next, and he was followed by the American Ambassador. \"We might as good sit down,\" said Julius, when he had introduced all his guests to each other. \"Tuppence, will you----\" He indicated the spot of honor with a roll of his hand. But Tuppence shook her head. \"No--that's Jane's place! When one thinks of how she's held out all these years, she ought to be made the king of the banquet to-night.\" Julius toss her a thankful glance, and Jane came ahead timidly to the allotted seat. Beautiful as she had seemed before, it was as zero to the comeliness that now went entire adorned. Tuppence had performed her portion faithfully. The simulation gown supplied by a famed seamstress had been entitled \"A tiger lily.\" It was all golds and reds and browns, and out of it rose the unadulterated editorial of the girl's Caucasian throat, and the tan masses of fuzz that crowned her adorable head. There was appreciation in every eye, as she took her seat. Soon the supper party was in entire swing, and with one treaty Tommy was called upon for a full and perfect explanation. \"You've been too darned near about the all business,\" Julius accused him. \"You let on to me that you were off to the Argentine--though I think you had your reasons for that. The thought of both you and Tuppence mould me for the portion of Mr. Brown but tickles me to death!\" \"The thought was not master to them,\" said Mr. Carter gravely. \"It was suggested, and the toxicant really cautiously instilled, by a past-master in the art. The paragraph in the New York report suggested the project to him, and by means of it he wove a web that nearly enmeshed you fatally.\" \"I ne'er liked him,\" said Julius. \"I felt from the beginning that there was something incorrect about him, and I ever suspected that it was he who silenced Mrs. Vandemeyer so appositely. But it wasn't trough I heard that the place for Tommy's executing came good on the heels of our audience with him that Sunday that I began to tumble to the fact that he was the big bug himself.\" \"I ne'er suspected it at all,\" lamented Tuppence. \"I've ever thought I was so lots cleverer than Tommy--but he's doubtless scored over me handsomely.\" Julius agreed. \"Tommy's been the goods this trip! And, rather of sitting there as slow as a fish, let him banish his blushes, and say us all about it.\" \"Hear! hear!\" \"There's zero to tell,\" said Tommy, astutely uncomfortable. \"I was an terrible mug--right up to the clock I found that photo of Annette, and realized that she was Jane Finn. so I remembered how persistently she had shouted out that phrase \u2018Marguerite'--and I thought of the pictures, and--well, that's that. so of class I went over the all matter to see where I'd made an ass of myself.\" \"Go on,\" said Mr. Carter, as Tommy showed signs of taking sanctuary in quiet formerly more. \"That job about Mrs. Vandemeyer had worried me when Julius told me about it. On the look of it, it seemed that he or Sir James must have done the trick. But I didn't love which. Finding that photo in the drawer, after that tale of how it had been got from him by Inspector Brown, made me suspect Julius. so I remembered that it was Sir James who had discovered the untrue Jane Finn. In the end, I couldn't make up my mind--and but decided to take no chances either way. I left a remark for Julius, in example he was Mr. Brown, saying I was off to the Argentine, and I dropped Sir James's missive with the provide of the job by the desk so that he would see it was a true stunt. so I wrote my missive to Mr. Carter and rang up Sir James. Taking him into my trust would be the best matter either way, so I told him everything except where I believed the papers to be hidden. The way he helped me to get on the trail of Tuppence and Annette almost disarmed me, but not quite. I kept my idea out-of-doors between the two of them. And so I got a phony remark from Tuppence--and I knew!\" \"But how?\" Tommy took the remark in doubt from his pouch and passed it round the table. \"It's her handwriting all right, but I knew it wasn't from her because of the signature. She'd ne'er enchantment her list \u2018Twopence,' but anyone who'd ne'er seen it written might quite easy do so. Julius _had_ seen it--he showed me a remark of hers to him once--but _Sir James hadn't!_ After that everything was sheer sailing. I sent off Albert post-haste to Mr. Carter. I pretended to go away, but doubled back again. When Julius came bursting up in his car, I felt it wasn't portion of Mr. Brown's plan--and that there would likely be trouble. Unless Sir James was really caught in the act, so to speak, I knew Mr. Carter would ne'er believe it of him on my naked word----\" \"I didn't,\" interposed Mr. Carter ruefully. \"That's why I sent the girls off to Sir James. I was certainly they'd fetch up at the home in Soho earlier or later. I threatened Julius with the revolver, because I wanted Tuppence to repeat that to Sir James, so that he wouldn't worry about us. The bit the girls were out of vision I told Julius to drive like pit for London, and as we went along I told him the all story. We got to the Soho home in enough of clock and met Mr. Carter outside. After arranging things with him we went in and hid behind the drapery in the recess. The policemen had orders to say, if they were asked, that no one had gone into the house. That's all.\" And Tommy came to an precipitous halt. There was quiet for a moment. \"By the way,\" said Julius suddenly, \"you're all incorrect about that photo of Jane. It _was_ taken from me, but I found it again.\" \"Where?\" scream Tuppence. \"In that small secure on the fence in Mrs. Vandemeyer's bedroom.\" \"I knew you found something,\" said Tuppence reproachfully. \"To tell you the truth, that's what started me off suspecting you. Why didn't you say?\" \"I think I was a speck suspect too. It had been got out from me once, and I determined I wouldn't let on I'd got it until a lensman had made a twelve copies of it!\" \"We all kept back something or other,\" said Tuppence thoughtfully. \"I guess hidden serving make makes you like that!\" In the interruption that ensued, Mr. Carter took from his pouch a small tatty brown book. \"Beresford has but said that I would not have believed Sir James Peel Edgerton to be shamed unless, so to speak, he was caught in the act. That is so. Indeed, not until I say the entries in this little Bible could I bring myself full to mention the awesome truth. This Bible will pass into the self-control of Scotland Yard, but it will ne'er be publicly exhibited. Sir James's yearn affiliation with the law would make it undesirable. But to you, who love the truth, I suggest to read sure passages which will throw some illumination on the over-the-top mindset of this outstanding man.\" He opened the book, and turned the slender pages. \"... It is craziness to keep this book. I know that. It is docudrama prove against me. But I have ne'er shrunk from taking risks. And I sense an pressing want for self-expression....

musgrave  the paper seem to me to be of no practical importance   but to me it seem immensely practical and i fancy that brunton take the same view he have probably see it before that night on which

But I must start.\" \"You've oceans of time.\" \"Perhaps\u2014perhaps. But I same plenty of leisure at the station. I do not want to rush, to hurry, to excite myself.\" \"At all events,\" I said, rising, \"I will come and see you off.\" \"You will do zero of the sort. I prohibit it.\" He was so magisterial that I stared at him in surprise. He nodded emphatically. \"I mean it, _mon ami___. Au revoir! You allow that I adopt you? Ah, no, I leave that it is not the English custom. Une poignee de main, alors.\" I felt instead at a slack end after Poirot had left me. I strolled down the beach, and watched the bathers, without sense industrious enough to join them. I instead fancied that Cinderella might be disporting herself amongst them in some fantastic costume, but I saw no signs of her. I strolled aimlessly on the sands towards the encourage end of the town. It occurred to me that, after all, it would but be enough feeling on my portion to inquire after the girl. And it would save problem in the end. The thing would so be finished with. There would be no want for me to problem some her any further. But, if I did not go at all, she might rather perhaps come and see me up at the Villa. And that would be annoying in every way. Decidedly it would be better to pay a small call, in the class of which I could make it rather make that I could do zero encourage for her in my content of showman. Accordingly I left the beach, and walked inland. I shortly found the H\u00f4tel du Phare, a really understated building. It was annoying in the utmost not to love the lady's list and, to save my dignity, I decided to stroll within and see around. probably I should find her in the lounge. Merlinville was a small place, you left your hotel to go to the beach, and you left the beach to return to the hotel. There were no former attractions. There was a Casino being built, but it was not yet completed. I had walked the duration of the beach without seeing her, therefore she must be in the hotel. I went in. various people were sitting in the petite lounge, but my pit was not amongst them. I looked into some former rooms, but there was no contract of her. I waited for some time, till my restlessness got the better of me. I took the concierge aside, and slipped five francs into his hand. \"I wish to see a madam who is staying here. A youth English lady, little and dark. I am not certainly of her name.\" The man shook his head, and seemed to be suppressing a grin. \"There is no such madam as you distinguish staying here.\" \"She is American possibly,\" I suggested. These fellows are so stupid. But the man continued to shake his head. \"No, monsieur. There are just six or seven English and American ladies altogether, and they are all lots older than the madam you are seeking. It is not here that you will find her, monsieur.\" He was so confident that I felt doubts. \"But the madam told me she was staying here.\" \"Monsieur must get made a mistake\u2014or it is more likely the madam did, since there has been another man here inquiring for her.\" \"What is that you say?\" I cried, surprised. \"But yes, monsieur. A man who described her just as you get done.\" \"What was he like?\" \"He was a little gentleman, good dressed, really neat, really spotless, the mustache really stiff, the chief of a singular shape, and the eyes green.\" Poirot! So that was why he refused to let me accompany him to the station. The impudence of it! I would thank him not to meddle in my concerns. Did he fancy I needed a nanny to look after me? Thanking the man, I departed, fairly at a loss, and even lots incensed with my officious friend. I regretted that he was, for the moment, out of reach. I should have enjoyed telling him what I thought of his unjustified interference. Had I not clearly told him that I had no intent of seeing the girl? Decidedly, one's friends can be too zealous! But where was the lady? I set apart my wrath, and tried to puzzle it out. Evidently, through inadvertence, she had named the incorrect hotel. so another thought hit me. Was it inadvertence? Or had she purposely withheld her list and given me the incorrect address? The more I thought about it, the more I felt convinced that this finally supposition of mine was right. For some argue or former she did not wish to let the friend ripen into friendship. And though half an minute earlier this had been exactly my own view, I did not enjoy having the tables turned upon me. The all matter was deeply unsatisfactory, and I went up to the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve in a circumstance of distinguishable ill humour. I did not go to the house, but went up the route to the little terrace by the shed, and sat there moodily enough. I was distracted from my thoughts by the sound of voices near at hand. In a 2nd or two I realized that they came, not from the garden I was in, but from the adjoining garden of the Villa Marguerite, and that they were approaching rapidly. A girl's sound was speaking, a sound that I recognized as that of the beautiful Marthe. \"_Ch\u00e9ri___,\" she was saying, \"is it really true? Are all our troubles over.\" \"You know it, Marthe,\" Jack Renauld replied. \"Nothing can portion us now, beloved. The finally obstruction to our Federal is removed. zero can take you from me.\" \"Nothing?\" the daughter murmured. \"Oh, Jack, Jack\u2014I am afraid.\" I had moved to depart, realizing that I was rather accidentally eavesdropping. As I rose to my feet, I caught vision of them through a gap in the hedge. They stood unitedly facing me, the man's arm round the girl, his eyes looking into hers. They were a magnificent looking couple, the dark, well-knit boy, and the reasonable youth goddess. They seemed made for each former as they stood there, glad in hurt of the awful disaster that overshadowed their youth lives. But the girl's look was troubled, and Jack Renauld seemed to recognize it, as he held her nearer to him and asked: \"But what are you afraid of, darling? What is there to fear\u2014now?\" And so I saw the look in her eyes, the look Poirot had spoken of, as she murmured, so that I nearly guessed at the words. \"I am afraid\u2014for _you___. ...\" I did not hear youth Renauld's answer, for my care was distracted by an strange appearing a little encourage down the hedge. There appeared to be a brown Dubya there, which seemed odd, to say the least of it, so other in the summer. I stepped along to investigate, but, at my advance, the brown Dubya withdrew itself precipitately, and faced me with a thumb to its lips. It was Giraud. Enjoining caution, he led the way round the shed until we were out of ear-shot. \"What were you doing there?\" I asked. \"Exactly what you were doing\u2014listening.\" \"But I was not there on purpose!\" \"Ah!\" said Giraud. \"I was.\" As always, I admired the man whilst disliking him. He looked me up and down with a kind of disdainful disfavour. \"You didn't assist matters by butting in. I might have heard something utilitarian in a minute. What have you done with your old fossil?\" \"M. Poirot has gone to Paris,\" I replied coldly. \"And I can tell you, M. Giraud, that he is anything but an old fossil."}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "she be very young a i have be god help her if like me she sacrifice everything to discover too late that she be only in

"Christie", "text": "The _Lusitania_ had been struck by two torpedoes in sequence and was sinking rapidly, while the boats were being launched with all potential speed. The women and children were being lined up awaiting their turn. Some even clung urgently to husbands and fathers; others clutched their children intimately to their breasts. One girl stood alone, somewhat aside from the rest. She was instead young, not more than eighteen. She did not seem afraid, and her grave, unwavering eyes looked straight ahead. \"I beg your pardon.\" A man's sound beside her made her begin and turn. She had noticed the talker more than formerly amongst the first-class passengers. There had been a tinge of whodunit about him which had appealed to her imagination. He spoke to no one. If anyone spoke to him he was fast to rebuff the overture. likewise he had a anxious way of looking over his shoulder with a swift, suspect glance. She noticed now that he was greatly agitated. There were beads of sweat on his brow. He was apparently in a nation of overmastering fear. And yet he did not strike her as the kind of man who would be afraid to meet death! \"Yes?\" Her grave eyes met his inquiringly. He stood looking at her with a sort of despairing irresolution. \"It must be!\" he muttered to himself. \"Yes--it is the just way.\" so aloud he said abruptly: \"You are an American?\" \"Yes.\" \"A loyal one?\" The daughter flushed. \"I think you've no good to ask such a thing! Of class I am!\" \"Don't be offended. You wouldn't be if you knew how lots there was at stake. But I've got to trust some one--and it must be a woman.\" \"Why?\" \"Because of \u2018women and children first.'\" He looked circle and lowered his voice. \"I'm carrying papers--vitally crucial papers. They may make all the deviation to the Allies in the war. You understand? These papers get _got_ to be saved! They've more opportunity with you than with me. Will you get them?\" The daughter held out her hand. \"Wait--I must warn you. There may be a risk--if I've been followed. I don't think I have, but one ne'er knows. If so, there will be danger. get you the heart to go through with it?\" The daughter smiled. \"I'll go through with it all right. And I'm actual gallant to be chosen! What am I to do with them afterwards?\" \"Watch the newspapers! I'll publicize in the personal editorial of the _Times_, beginning \u2018Shipmate.' At the end of three days if there's nothing--well, you'll know I'm low and out. so get the package to the American Embassy, and deliver it into the Ambassador's own hands. Is that clear?\" \"Quite clear.\" \"Then be ready--I'm going to say good-bye.\" He took her give in his. \"Good-bye. good chance to you,\" he said in a loud tone. Her give closed on the slicker package that had lain in his palm. The _Lusitania_ settled with a more settle name to starboard. In reply to a fast command, the daughter went ahead to take her spot in the boat. \"TOMMY, old thing!\" \"Tuppence, old bean!\" The two youth people greeted each former affectionately, and momentarily blocked the Dover Street Tube passing in doing so. The adjective \"old\" was misleading. Their unify ages would surely not get totalled forty-five. \"Not seen you for merely centuries,\" continued the youth man. \"Where are you off to? Come and chew a bun with me. We're getting a bit unpopular here--blocking the gangplank as it were. Let's get out of it.\" The daughter assenting, they started walking low Dover Street towards Piccadilly. \"Now then,\" said Tommy, \"where shall we go?\" The really feeble anxiousness which underlay his timbre did not escape the shrewd ears of Miss Prudence Cowley, recognize to her informal friends for some mystical argue as \"Tuppence.\" She pounced at once. \"Tommy, you're stony!\" \"Not a bit of it,\" declared Tommy unconvincingly. \"Rolling in cash.\" \"You always were a shameful liar,\" said Tuppence severely, \"though you did formerly persuade Sister Greenbank that the physician had ordered you beer as a tonic, but leave to write it on the chart. Do you remember?\" Tommy chuckled. \"I should think I did! Wasn't the old cat in a fury when she found out? Not that she was a bad sort really, old Mother Greenbank! Good old hospital--demobbed like everything else, I suppose?\" Tuppence sighed. \"Yes. You too?\" Tommy nodded. \"Two months ago.\" \"Gratuity?\" hinted Tuppence. \"Spent.\" \"Oh, Tommy!\" \"No, old thing, not in exuberant dissipation. No such luck! The price of living--ordinary plain, or garden living nowadays is, I ensure you, if you do not know----\" \"My darling child,\" interrupted Tuppence, \"there is zero I do _not_ know about the price of living. Here we are at Lyons', and we will each of us pay for our own. That's it!\" And Tuppence led the way upstairs. The spot was full, and they wandered about looking for a table, catching odds and ends of conversation as they did so. \"And--do you know, she sat down and _cried_ when I told her she couldn't have the flat after all.\" \"It was merely a _bargain_, my dear! Just like the one Mabel Lewis brought from Paris----\" \"Funny scraps one does overhear,\" murmured Tommy. \"I passed two Johnnies in the street to-day talking about some one called Jane Finn. Did you ever listen such a name?\" But at that bit two older ladies rose and collected parcels, and Tuppence dexterously ensconced herself in one of the vacant seats. Tommy ordered tea and buns. Tuppence ordered tea and buttered toast. \"And idea the tea comes in split teapots,\" she added severely. Tommy sat down contrary her. His denude chief revealed a jolt of delicately slicked-back red hair. His look was agreeably ugly--nondescript, yet remarkably the look of a man and a sportsman. His brown fit was well cut, but dangerously near the end of its tether. They were an basically modern-looking couple as they sat there. Tuppence had no take to beauty, but there was role and captivate in the elfish lines of her little face, with its determined mentum and large, wide-apart grey eyes that looked vaguely out from under straight, dark brows. She wore a small shining park turban over her dark curtsy hair, and her extremely little and rather tatty doll revealed a pair of uncommonly exquisite ankles. Her appearing presented a valorous effort at smartness. The tea came at last, and Tuppence, rousing herself from a fit of meditation, poured it out. \"Now then,\" said Tommy, taking a big sting of bun, \"let's get up-to-date. Remember, I haven't seen you since that clock in infirmary in 1916.\" \"Very well.\" Tuppence helped herself generously to buttered toast. \"Abridged life of Miss Prudence Cowley, 5th daughter of Archdeacon Cowley of Little Missendell, Suffolk.

will be find mind it be for it the last thing of mine that ill lose in this den of thieve well well mr holmes youll excuse my trouble you about such a trifle i think it well worth trouble about why you look very serious over it how do you explain it i just dont attempt to explain it it seem the very maddest queerest thing that ever happen to me the queerest perhaps say holmes thoughtfully what do you make of it yourself well i dont profess to understand it yet this case of yours be very complex sir henry when take in conjunction with your uncle death i be not sure that of all the five hundred case of capital importance which i have handle there be one which cut so deep but we hold several thread in our hand and the odds be that one or other of them guide u to the truth we may waste time in follow the wrong one but sooner or later we must come upon the right we have a pleasant luncheon in which little be say of the business which have bring u together it be in the private sitting room to which we afterwards repair that holmes ask baskerville what be his intention to go to baskerville hall and when at the end of the week on the whole say holmes i think that your decision be a wise one i have ample evidence that you be be dog in london and amid the million of this great city it be difficult to discover who these people be or what their object can be if their intention be evil they might do you a mischief and we should be powerless to prevent it you do not know dr mortimer that you be follow this morning from my house dr mortimer start violently follow by whom that unfortunately be what i cannot tell you have you among your neighbour or acquaintance on dartmoor any man with a black full beard no or let me see why yes barrymore sir charles butler be a man with a full black beard ha where be barrymore he be in charge of the hall we have best ascertain if he be really there or if by any possibility he might be in london how can you do that give me a telegraph form be all ready for sir henry that will do address to mr barrymore baskerville hall what be the nearest telegraph office grimpen very good we will send a second wire to the postmaster grimpen telegram to mr barrymore to be deliver into his own hand if absent please return wire to sir henry baskerville northumberland hotel that should let u know before even whether barrymore be at his post in devonshire or not thats so say baskerville by the way dr mortimer who be this barrymore anyhow he be the son of the old caretaker who be dead they have look after the hall for four generation now so far a i know he and his wife be a respectable a couple a any in the county at the same time say baskerville it clear enough that so long a there be none of the family at the hall these people have a mighty fine home and nothing to do that be true do barrymore profit at all by sir charles will ask holmes he and his wife have five hundred pound each ha do they know that they would receive this yes sir charles be very fond of talk about the provision of his will that be very interest i hope say dr mortimer that you do not look with suspicious eye upon everyone who receive a legacy from sir charles for i also have a thousand pound leave to me indeed and anyone else there be many insignificant sum to individual and a large number of public charity the residue all go to sir henry and how much be the residue seven hundred and forty thousand pound holmes raise his eyebrow in surprise i have no idea that so gigantic a sum be involve say he sir charles have the reputation of be rich but we do not know how very rich he be until we come to examine his security the total value of the estate be close on to a million dear me it be a stake for which a man might well play a desperate game and one more question dr mortimer suppose that anything happen to our young friend here you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis who would inherit the estate since rodger baskerville sir charles younger brother die unmarried the estate would descend to the desmonds who be distant cousin jam desmond be an elderly clergyman in westmoreland thank you these detail be all of great interest have you meet mr jam desmond yes he once come down to visit sir charles he be a man of venerable appearance and of saintly life i remember that he refuse to accept any settlement from sir charles though he press it upon him and this man of simple taste would be the heir to sir charles thousand he would be the heir to the estate because that be entail he would also be the heir to the money unless it be will otherwise by the present owner who can of course do what he like with it and have you make your will sir henry no mr holmes i have not ive have no time for it be only yesterday that i learn how matter stand but in any case i feel that the money should go with the title and estate that be my poor uncle idea how be the owner go to restore the glory of"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "have he be

This man was clear an subordinate obeying the orders of a superior. Could that higher-up by any opportunity be Pagett? He called and two Kafirs appeared. I was taken upstairs. Despite my struggles, I was gagged and so destined give and foot. The way into which they had taken me was a sort of loft good under the roof. It was dust-covered and showed small signs of having been occupied. The Dutchman made a mock bow and withdrew, closing the door behind him. I was rather helpless. Turn and spin as I would, I could not loosen my hands in the slightest degree, and the gag prevented me from crying out. If, by any potential chance, any one did do to the house, I could do zero to attract their attention. Down below I heard the audio of a door shutting. apparently the Dutchman was going out. It was maddening not to be able to do anything. I strained again at my bonds, but the knots held. I desisted at last, and either fainted or fell asleep. When I awoke I was in anguish all over. It was rather dark now, and I judged that the dark must be good advanced, for the daydream was high in the heavens and shining low through the dust-covered skylight. The gag was half choking me and the hardness and anguish were unendurable. It was so that my eyes fell on a bit of crushed glaze stay in the corner. A moon-ray slanted good low on it, and its shining had caught my attention. As I looked at it, an thought came into my head. My arms and legs were helpless, but certainly I could still _roll._ Slowly and awkwardly, I set myself in motion. It was not easy. Besides being highly painful, since I could not guard my look with my arms, it was likewise extremely hard to keep any specific direction. I tended to roll in every way except the one I wanted to go. In the end, however, I came good up against my objective. It nearly touched my destined hands. still so it was not easy. It took an eternity of clock before I could wriggle the glaze into such a position, wedged against the wall, that it would rub up and down on my bonds. It was a yearn heart-rending process, and I nearly despaired, but in the end I succeeded in sawing through the cords that bound my wrists. The rest was a thing of time. Once I had restored the circulation to my hands by rubbing the wrists vigorously, I was able to undo the gag. One or two entire breaths did a lot for me. Very shortly I had undone the finally knot, though even so it was some clock before I could stand on my feet, but at finally I bear erect, swinging my arms to and fro to restore the circulation, and wishing above all things that I could get hold of something to eat. I waited some a fourth of an hour, to be rather certainly of my regain strength. so I tiptoed soundlessly to the door. As I had hoped, it was not locked, but latched. I unlatched it and peeped carefully out. Everything was still. The Moon came in through a window and showed me the dust-covered uncarpeted staircase. Cautiously I crawl down it. even no sound\u2014but as I stood on the shore below, a feeble croak of voices reached me. I stopped suddenly and stood there for some time. A clock on the fence registered the fact that it was after midnight. I was full mindful of the risks I might run if I descended lower, but my question was too lots for me. With innumerable precautions I prepared to explore. I crawl gently down the finally flying of stairs and stood in the straight hall. I looked circle me\u2014and so caught my hint with a gasp. A Kafir boy was sitting by the foyer door. He had not seen me, so I shortly realized by his respiration that he was fast asleep. Should I retreat, or should I go on? The voices came from the way I had been shown into on arrival. One of them was that of my Dutch friend, the former I could not for the bit recognize, though it seemed mistily familiar. In the end I decided that it was clear my obligation to hear all I could. I must risk the Kafir boy waking up. I crossed the foyer soundlessly and knelt by the survey door. For a bit or two I could hear no better. The voices were louder, but I could not distinguish what they said. I applied my eye to the keyhole rather of my ear. As I had guessed, one of the speakers was the big Dutchman. The former man was sitting out-of-door my confine array of vision. abruptly he rose to get himself a drink. His back, black garb and decorous, came into view. still before he turned round I knew who he was. Mr. Chichester! Now I began to make out the words. \"All the same, it is dangerous. Suppose her friends come after her?\" It was the big man speaking. Chichester answered him. He had dropped his clerical audio entirely. No wonder I had not recognized it. \"All bluff. They haven't an thought where she is.\" \"She spoke really positively.\" \"I presume say. I've looked into the matter, and we've zero to fear. Anyway, it's the \u2018Colonel's' orders. You don't need to go against them, I suppose?\" The Dutchman ejaculated something in his own language. I judged it to be a headlong disclaimer. \"But why not knock her on the head?\" he growled. \"It would be simple. The boat is all ready. She could be taken out to sea?\" \"Yes,\" said Chichester meditatively. \"That is what I should do. She knows too much, that is certain. But the \u2018Colonel' is a man who likes to play a solitary hand\u2014though no one else must do so.\" Something in his own words seemed to awaken a remembering that annoyed him. \"He wants info of some sort from this girl.\" He had paused before the information, and the Dutchman was quick to catch him up. \"Information?\" \"Something of the kind.\" \"Diamonds,\" I said to myself. \"And now,\" continued Chichester, \"give me the lists.\" For a yearn clock their conversation was rather inexplicable to me. It seemed to deal with big quantities of vegetables. Dates were mentioned, prices, and several names of places which I did not know. It was rather half an minute before they had finished their see and counting. \"Good,\" said Chichester, and there was a sound as though he pushed back his chair. \"I will take these with me for the \u2018Colonel' to see.\" \"When do you leave?\" \"Ten o'clock to-morrow morn will do.\" \"Do you want to see the daughter before you go?\" \"No. There are rigorous orders that no one is to see her until the \u2018Colonel' comes. Is she all right?\" \"I looked in on her when I came in for dinner. She was asleep, I think. What about food?\" \"A small starving will do no harm. The \u2018Colonel' will be here some clock to-morrow. She will answer questions better if she is hungry. No one had better go near her trough then. Is she firmly tied up?\" The Dutchman laughed. \"What do you think?\" They both laughed. So did I, under my breath. Then, as the sounds seemed to betoken that they were about to come out of the room, I rhythm a headlong retreat. I was just in time. As I reached the chief of the stairs, I heard the door of the way open, and at the like time the Kafir stirred and moved. My hideaway by the way of the foyer door was not to be thought of. I retired providentially to the attic, gathered my bonds round me and lay down again on the floor, in example they should take it into their heads to come and look at me. They did not do so, however. After about an hour, I crawl down the stairs, but the Kafir by the door was alive and humming gently to himself.

we be to dine at merripit house next friday a a sign of it i dont say now that he isnt a crazy man say sir henry i cant forget the look in his eye when he run at me this morning but i must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he have do do he give any explanation of his conduct his sister be everything in his life he say that be natural enough and i be glad that he should understand her value they have always be together and accord to his account he have be a very lonely man with only her a a companion so that the think of lose her be really terrible to him he have not

responsible for what he say or do he be very sorry for all that have pas and he recognize how foolish and how selfish it be that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful woman like his sister
