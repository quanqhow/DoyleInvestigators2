Anyhow, whoever it was that night, left this little souvenir.\" Gertrude took one look at the cuff-link, and went as white as the pearls in it; she clutched at the foot of the bed, and stood staring. As for me, I was quite as astonished as she was. \"Where did--you--find it?\" she asked finally, with a desperate effort at calm. And while I told her she stood looking out of the window with a look I could not fathom on her face. It was a relief when Mrs. Watson tapped at the door and brought me some tea and toast. The cook was in bed, completely demoralized, she reported, and Liddy, brave with the daylight, was looking for footprints around the house. Mrs. Watson herself was a wreck; she was blue-white around the lips, and she had one hand tied up. She said she had fallen down-stairs in her excitement. It was natural, of course, that the thing would shock her, having been the Armstrongs' housekeeper for several years, and knowing Mr. Arnold well. Gertrude had slipped out during my talk with Mrs. Watson, and I dressed and went down-stairs. The billiard and card-rooms were locked until the coroner and the detectives got there, and the men from the club had gone back for more conventional clothing. I could hear Thomas in the pantry, alternately wailing for Mr. Arnold, as he called him, and citing the tokens that had precursed the murder. The house seemed to choke me, and, slipping a shawl around me, I went out on the drive. At the corner by the east wing I met Liddy. Her skirts were draggled with dew to her knees, and her hair was still in crimps. \"Go right in and change your clothes,\" I said sharply. \"You're a sight, and at your age!\" She had a golf-stick in her hand, and she said she had found it on the lawn. There was nothing unusual about it, but it occurred to me that a golf-stick with a metal end might have been"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "At the door she stopped and turned around timidly. \"Has--has anything happened to disturb my sister?\" she asked. \"She--has been almost irritable all day.\" Almost! \"She is worried about her colored orphans,\" I evaded. \"She does not approve of fireworks for them on the fourth of July.\" Miss Jane was satisfied. I watched her little, old, black-robed figure go lightly down the hall. Then I bolted the door, opened all the windows, and proceeded to a surreptitious smoke. The windows being wide open, it was not long before a great moth came whirring in. He hurled himself at the light and then, dazzled and singed, began to beat with noisy thumps against the barrier of the ceiling. Finding no egress there, he was back at the lamp again, whirling in dizzy circles until at last, worn out, he dropped to the table, where he lay on his back, kicking impotently. The room began to fill with tiny winged creatures that flung themselves headlong to destruction, so I put out the light and sat down near the window, with my cigar and my thoughts. Miss Letitia's troubles I dismissed shortly. While it was odd that only ten pearls should have been taken, still--in every other way it bore the marks of an ordinary theft. The thief might have thought that by leaving the majority of the gems he could postpone discovery indefinitely. But the Fleming case was of a different order. Taken by itself, Fleming's disappearance could have been easily accounted for. There must be times in the lives of all unscrupulous individuals when they feel the need of retiring temporarily from the public eye. But the intrusion into the Fleming home, the ransacked desk and the broken money drawer--most of all, the bit of paper with eleven twenty-two on it--here was a hurdle my legal mind refused to take. I had finished my second cigar, and was growing more and more wakeful, when I heard a footstep on the path around the house.

That's agreeable to you, is it, Burns?\" \"But I don't know anything about a ship,\" I objected. \"I'm willing enough, but I'm not competent.\" I believe the thing had been discussed before I went up, for McNamara spoke up from the wheel. \"We'll manage that somehow or other, Leslie,\" he said. \"We want somebody to take charge, somebody with a head, that's all. And since you ain't, in a manner of speaking, been one of us, nobody's feelings can't be hurt. Ain't that it, boys?\" \"That, and a matter of brains,\" said Burns. \"But Singleton?\" I glanced aft. \"Singleton is going in irons,\" was the reply I got. The light was stronger now, and I could see their faces. It was clear that the crew, or a majority of the crew, believed him guilty, and that, as far as Singleton was concerned, my authority did not exist. \"All right,\" I said. \"I'll do the best I can. First of all, I want every man to give up his weapons. Burns!\" \"Aye, aye.\" \"Go over each man. Leave them their pocket-knives; take everything else.\" The men lined up. The situation was tense, horrible, so that the miscellaneous articles from their pockets--knives, keys, plugs of chewing tobacco, and here and there, among the foreign ones, small combs for beard and mustache unexpectedly brought to light, caused a smile of pure reaction. Two revolvers from Oleson and McNamara and one nicked razor from Adams completed the list of weapons we found. The crew submitted willingly.

She felt rather than saw Julius throw a sideways glance at her. \"Say, shall we go for a spin in the park?\" \"If you like.\" For a while they ran on under the trees in silence. It was a beautiful day. The keen rush through the air brought a new exhilaration to Tuppence. \"Say, Miss Tuppence, do you think I'm ever going to find Jane?\" Julius spoke in a discouraged voice. The mood was so alien to him that Tuppence turned and stared at him in surprise. He nodded. \"That's so. I'm getting down and out over the business. Sir James to-day hadn't got any hope at all, I could see that. I don't like him--we don't gee together somehow--but he's pretty cute, and I guess he wouldn't quit if there was any chance of success--now, would he?\" Tuppence felt rather uncomfortable, but clinging to her belief that Julius also had withheld something from her, she remained firm. \"He suggested advertising for the nurse,\" she reminded him. \"Yes, with a ‘forlorn hope' flavour to his voice!

Tuppence took it and scrutinized it carefully. It bore the inscription, \"Mr. Edward Whittington.\" Below the name were the words \"Esthonia Glassware Co.,\" and the address of a city office. Mr. Whittington spoke again: \"If you will call upon me to-morrow morning at eleven o'clock, I will lay the details of my proposition before you.\" \"At eleven o'clock?\" said Tuppence doubtfully. \"At eleven o'clock.\" Tuppence made up her mind. \"Very well. I'll be there.\" \"Thank you. Good evening.\" He raised his hat with a flourish, and walked away. Tuppence remained for some minutes gazing after him. Then she gave a curious movement of her shoulders, rather as a terrier shakes himself. \"The adventures have begun,\" she murmured to herself. \"What does he want me to do, I wonder? There's something about you, Mr. Whittington, that I don't like at all. But, on the other hand, I'm not the least bit afraid of you.

I was only ragging you! The papers are full up to the brim with that type of thing. Now listen--how's this? ‘Two young adventurers for hire. Willing to do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good.'

Would Fleming know you?\" \"No, but of course Wardrop would.\" As if in answer to my objection, Wardrop appeared at that moment. He ran down the painted wooden stairs and hurried through the room without looking to right or left. The piano kept on, and the men at the tables were still engrossed with their glasses and one another. Wardrop was very pale; he bolted into a man at the door, and pushed him aside without ceremony. \"You might go up now,\" Hunter said, rising. \"I will see where the young gentleman is making for. Just open the door of the different rooms up-stairs, look around for Fleming, and if any one notices you, ask if Al Hunter is there. That will let you out.\" He left me then, and after waiting perhaps a minute, I went up-stairs alone. The second floor was the ordinary upper story of a small dwelling house. The doors were closed, but loud talking, smoke, and the rattle of chips floated out through open transoms. From below the noise of the piano came up the staircase, unmelodious but rhythmical, and from the street on which the house faced an automobile was starting its engine, with a series of shot-like explosions. The noise was confusing, disconcerting. I opened two doors, to find only the usual poker table, with the winners sitting quietly, their cards bunched in the palms of their hands, and the losers, growing more voluble as the night went on, buying chips recklessly, drinking more than they should. The atmosphere was"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "The numbers have followed me.

He was opening a can of caviar at a table in the corner and came out in response to a gesture. He did not ask any questions, and I let him go into the death chamber unprepared. The presence of death apparently had no effect on him, but the identity of the dead man almost stupefied him. \"Fleming!\" he said, awed, as he looked down at the body. \"Fleming, by all that's sacred! And a suicide!\" Hunter watched him grimly. \"How long has he been dead?\" he asked. The doctor glanced at the bullet wound in the forehead, and from there significantly to the group around the couch. \"Not an hour--probably less than half,\" he said. \"It's strange we heard nothing, across the hall there.\" Hunter took a clean folded handkerchief from his pocket and opening it laid it gently over the dead face. I think it was a relief to all of us. The doctor got up from his kneeling posture beside the couch, and looked at Hunter inquiringly. \"What about getting him away from here?\" he said. \"There is sure to be a lot of noise about it, and--you remember what happened when Butler killed himself here.\" \"He was reported as being found dead in the lumber yard,\" Hunter said dryly. \"Well, Doctor, this body stays where it is, and I don't give a whoop if the whole city government wants it moved. It won't be.

He looked me up and down with a sort of contemptuous disfavour. \"You didn't help matters by butting in. I might have heard something useful in a minute. What have you done with your old fossil?\" \"M. Poirot has gone to Paris,\" I replied coldly. \"And I can tell you, M. Giraud, that he is anything but an old fossil. He has solved many cases that have completely baffled the English police.\" \"Bah! The English police!\" Giraud snapped his fingers disdainfully. \"They must be on a level with our examining magistrates. So he has gone to Paris, has he? Well, a good thing. The longer he stays there, the better. But what does he think he will find there?\" I thought I read in the question a tinge of uneasiness. I drew myself up. \"That I am not at liberty to say,\" I said quietly. Giraud subjected me to a piercing stare. \"He has probably enough sense not to tell _you___,\" he remarked rudely. \"Good afternoon. I'm busy.\" And with that, he turned on his heel, and left me without ceremony. Matters seemed at a standstill at the Villa Geneviève. Giraud evidently did not desire my company and, from what I had seen, it seemed fairly certain that Jack Renauld did not either. I went back to the town, had an enjoyable bath and returned to the hotel. I turned in early, wondering whether the following day would bring forth anything of interest. I was wholly unprepared for what it did bring forth. I was eating my petit déjeuner in the dining-room, when the waiter, who had been talking to some one outside, came back in obvious excitement. He hesitated for a minute, fidgeting with his napkin, and then burst out. \"Monsieur will pardon me, but he is connected, is he not,"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "I had the women under guard.

As Turner ceased, he took a step forward. \"You are right, Mr. Turner,\" he said. \"It's your ship, and it's up to you to say where she goes and how she goes, sir. But some one will hang for this, Mr. Turner,--some one that's on this deck now; and the bodies are going back with us--likewise the axe. There ain't going to be a mistake--the right man is going to swing.\" \"That's mutiny!\" \"Yes, sir,\" Burns acknowledged, his face paling a little. \"I guess you could call it that.\" Turner swung on his heel and went below, where Jones, relieved of guard duty by Burns, reported him locked in his room, refusing admission to his wife and Miss Lee, both of whom had knocked on the door. The trouble with Turner added to the general misery of the situation. Burns got our position at noon with more or less exactness, and the general working of the Ella went on well enough. But the situation was indescribable. Men started if a penknife dropped, and swore if a sail flapped. The call of the boatswain's pipe rasped their ears, and the preparation for stowing the bodies in the jolly-boat left them unnerved and sick. Some sort of a meal was cooked, but no one could eat; Williams brought up, untasted, the luncheon he had carried down to the after house. At two o'clock all hands gathered amidships, and the bodies were carried forward to where the boat, lowered in its davits and braced, lay on the deck. It had been lined with canvas and tarpaulin, and a cover of similar material lay ready to be nailed in place. All the men were bareheaded. Many were in tears.

Yesterday, before they moved up, I wound it again.\" \"The key is gone also. Well, what of it, Holcombe? Did he brain her with the clock?

I told him only the outlines of our story, and I believe he half discredited me at first. God knows, I was not a creditable object. When I took him aft and showed him the jolly-boat, he realized, at last, that he was face to face with a great tragedy, and paid it the tribute of throwing away his cigar. He suggested our raising the yellow plague flag; and this we did, with a ready response from the quarantine officer. The quarantine officer came out in a power-boat, and mounted the ladder; and from that moment my command of the Ella ceased. Turner, immaculately dressed, pale, distinguished, member of the yacht club and partner in the Turner line, met him at the rail, and conducted him, with a sort of chastened affability, to the cabin. Exhausted from lack of sleep, terrified with what had gone by and what was yet to come, unshaven and unkempt, the men gathered on the forecastle-head and waited. The conference below lasted perhaps an hour. At the end of that time the quarantine officer came up and shouted a direction from below, as a result of which the jolly-boat was cut loose, and, towed by the tug, taken to the quarantine station. There was an argument, I believe, between Turner and the officer, as to allowing us to proceed up the river without waiting for the police.

Margery had gone to Miss Letitia's room, and Wardrop was pacing up and down the veranda, smoking. He looked dejected and anxious, and he welcomed my suggestion that he walk down to the station with me. As we went, a man emerged from the trees across and came slowly after us. \"You see, I am only nominally a free agent,\" he said morosely. \"They'll poison me yet; I know too much.\" We said little on the way to the train. Just before it came thundering along, however, he spoke again. \"I am going away, Knox. There isn't anything in this political game for me, and the law is too long. I have a chum in Mexico, and he wants me to go down there.\" \"Permanently?\" \"Yes. There's nothing to hold me here now,\" he said. I turned and faced him in the glare of the station lights. \"What do you mean?\" I demanded. \"I mean that there isn't any longer a reason why one part of the earth is better than another. Mexico or Alaska, it's all the same to me.\" He turned on his heel and left me. I watched him swing up the path, with his head down; I saw the shadowy figure of the other man fall into line behind him. Then I caught the platform of the last car as it passed, and that short ride into town was a triumphal procession with the wheels beating time and singing: \"It's all the same--the same--to me--to me.\" I called Burton by telephone, and was lucky enough to find him at"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "The Kafir was clearly on guard for the night. I remained there patiently all through the sounds of early morning preparation. The men breakfasted in the hall, I could hear their voices distinctly floating up the stairs. I was getting thoroughly unnerved. How on earth was I to get out of the house? I counselled myself to be patient. A rash move might spoil everything. After breakfast came the sounds of Chichester departing. To my intense relief, the Dutchman accompanied him. I waited breathlessly. Breakfast was being cleared away, the work of the house was being done. At last, the various activities seemed to die down. I slipped out from my lair once more. Very carefully I crept down the stairs. The hall was empty. Like a flash I was across it, had unlatched the door, and was outside in the sunshine. I ran down the drive like one possessed. Once outside, I resumed a normal walk. People stared at me curiously, and I do not wonder. My face and clothes must have been covered in dust from rolling about in the attic. At last I came to a garage. I went in. \"I have met with an accident,\" I explained. \"I want a car to take me to Cape Town at once. I must catch the boat to Durban.\" I had not long to wait. Ten minutes later I was speeding along in the direction of Cape Town. I must know if Chichester was on the boat. Whether to sail on her myself or not, I could not determine, but in the end I decided to do so. Chichester would not know that I had seen him in the Villa at Muizenberg. He would doubtless lay further traps for me, but I was forewarned. And he was the man I was after, the man who was seeking the diamonds on behalf of the mysterious \"Colonel.\" Alas, for my plans!

She'd have been scared out of her life if she'd known that I'd come to life again.\" \"Harry, if Colonel Race hadn't told me, what did you mean to do?\" \"Say nothing. Go on as Lucas.\" \"And your father's millions?\" \"Race was welcome to them. Anyway, he would make a better use of them than I ever shall. Anne, what are you thinking about? You're frowning so.\" \"I'm thinking,\" I said slowly, \"that I almost wish Colonel Race hadn't made you tell me.\" \"No. He was right. I owed you the truth.\" He paused, then said suddenly: \"You know, Anne, I'm jealous of Race. He loves you too—and he's a bigger man than I am or ever shall be.\" I turned to him, laughing. \"Harry, you idiot. It's you I want—and that's all that matters.\" As soon as possible we started for Cape Town. There Suzanne was waiting to greet me, and we disembowelled the big giraffe together. When the Revolution was finally quelled, Colonel Race came down to Cape Town and at his suggestion the big villa at Muizenberg that had belonged to Sir Lawrence Eardsley was reopened and we all took up our abode in it. There we made our plans. I was to return to England with Suzanne and to be married from her house in London. And the trousseau was to be bought in Paris! Suzanne enjoyed planning all these details enormously. So did I. And yet the future seemed curiously unreal.

It seemed a strangely unsatisfying amount. I waited in some trepidation for what was coming next. I feared that Mr. Flemming would be sure to have an aunt in Scotland who was in want of a bright young companion. Apparently, however, he hadn't. \"The question is,\" he went on, \"the future. I understand you have no living relatives?\" \"I'm alone in the world,\" I said, and was struck anew by my likeness to a film heroine. \"You have friends?\" \"Every one has been very kind to me,\" I said gratefully. \"Who would not be kind to one so young and charming?\" said Mr. Flemming gallantly. \"Well, well, my dear, we must see what can be done.\" He hesitated a minute, and then said: \"Supposing—how would it be if you came to us for a time?\" I jumped at the chance. London! The place for things to happen. \"It's awfully kind of you,\" I said. \"Might I really? Just while I'm looking round. I must start out to earn my living, you know?\" \"Yes, yes, my dear child. I quite understand. We will look round for something—suitable.\" I felt instinctively that Mr. Flemming's ideas of \"something suitable\" and mine were likely to be widely divergent, but it was certainly not the moment I rang the bell, and a smiling Kafir boy answered it. \"Mrs. Raffini?\" I inquired. He ushered me in, preceded me down the passage and flung open a door. Just as I was about to pass in, I hesitated. I felt a sudden misgiving. I stepped over the threshold and the door swung sharply to behind me.

Another murder—and Poirot away! What fatality. But who had been murdered? I dashed in at the gate. A group of the servants was in the drive, talking and gesticulating. I caught hold of Françoise. \"What has happened?\" \"Oh, monsieur! monsieur! Another death! It is terrible. There is a curse upon the house. But yes, I say it, a curse! They should send for M. le curé to bring some holy water. Never will I sleep another night under that roof.

They found him up there—in the shed—not a hundred yards from where they found poor Monsieur. And that is not all. He is stabbed—stabbed to the heart _with the same dagger!___\" Waiting for no more, I turned and ran up the path to the shed. The two men on guard there stood aside to let me pass and, filled with excitement, I entered. The light was dim, the place was a mere rough wooden erection to keep old pots and tools in. I had entered impetuously, but on the threshold I checked myself, fascinated by the spectacle before me. Giraud was on his hands and knees, a pocket torch in his hand with which he was examining every inch of the ground. He looked up with a frown at my entrance, then his face relaxed a little in a sort of good-humoured contempt. \"Ah, _c'est l'Anglais!___ Enter then. Let us see what you can make of this affair.\" Rather stung by his tone, I stooped my head, and passed in. \"There he is,\" said Giraud, flashing his torch to the far corner. I stepped across.

She told it to me, sitting propped in a chair in Mrs. Johns's room, her face white, her lips dry and twitching. The crew were making such breakfast as they could on deck, and Mr. Turner was still in a stupor in his room across the main cabin. The four women, drawn together in their distress, were huddled in the center of the room, touching hands now and then, as if finding comfort in contact, and reassurance. \"I went to bed early,\" said the stewardess; \"about ten o'clock, I think. Karen had not come down; I wakened when the watch changed. It was hot, and the window from our room to the deck was open. There is a curtain over it, to keep the helmsman from looking in--it is close to the wheel. The bell, striking every half-hour, does not waken me any more, although it did at first. It is just outside the window. But I heard the watch change. I heard eight bells struck, and the lookout man on the forecastle head call, 'All's well.' \"I sat up and turned on the lights. Karen had not come down, and I was alarmed. She had been--had been flirting a little with one of the sailors, and I had warned her that it would not do. She'd be found out and get into trouble. \"The only way to reach our cabin was through the chart-room, and when I opened the door an inch or two, I saw why Karen had not come down. Mr. Turner and Mr. Singleton were sitting there. They were--\" She hesitated. \"Please go on,\" said Mrs. Turner. \"They were drinking?\" \"Yes, Mrs. Turner. And Mr. Vail was there, too. He was saying that the captain would come down and there would be more trouble. I shut the door and stood just inside, listening.

I believe he intended to impress us both with his coolness, but it was an unfortunate attempt. His lips, relieved of the pressure, were twitching; his nerveless fingers could hardly refold the handkerchief. \"Wh-why was I not--called at once?\" he demanded. \"I notified you. You were--you must have gone to sleep again.\" \"I don't believe you called me. You're--lying, aren't you?\" He got up, steadying himself by the wall, and swaying dizzily to the motion of the ship. \"You shut me off down here, and then run things your own damned way.\" He turned on Miss Lee. \"Where's Helen?\" \"In her room, Marsh. She has one of her headaches. Please don't disturb her.\" \"Where's Williams?\" He turned to me. \"I can get him for you.\" \"Tell him to bring me a highball. My mouth's sticky.\" He ran his tongue over his dry lips. \"And--take a message from me to Richardson--\"  He stopped, startled. Indeed, Miss Lee and I had both started. \"To who's running the boat, anyhow? Singleton?\" \"Mr. Singleton is a prisoner in the forward house,\" I said gravely. The effect of this was astonishing. He stared at us both, and, finding corroboration in Miss Lee's face, his own took on an instant expression of relief. He dropped to the side of the bed, and his color came slowly back. He even smiled--a crafty grin that was inexpressibly horrible. \"Singleton!\" he said. \"Why do they--how do they know it was he?\" \"He had quarreled with the captain last night, and he was on duty at the time of the when the thing happened.

It was extravagance, ruinous extravagance.\" \"Harry stays with us when he is in Manchester,\" Miss Jane went on, nodding brightly across at Letitia as if she, too, were damning the executive board. \"Lately, he has been almost all the time in Plattsburg. He is secretary to Margery's father. It is a position of considerable responsibility, and we are very proud of him.\" I had expected something of the sort, but the remainder of the meal had somehow lost its savor. There was a lull in the conversation while dessert was being brought in. Miss Jane sat quivering, watching her sister's face for signs of trouble; the latter had subsided into muttered grumbling, and Miss Fleming sat, one hand on the table, staring absently at her engagement ring. \"You look like a fool in that cap, Jane,\" volunteered Letitia, while the plates were being brought in. \"What's for dessert?\" \"Ice-cream,\" called Miss Jane, over the table. \"Well, you needn't,\" snapped Letitia, \"I can hear you well enough.

Then he began to pace the room nervously, evidently debating some move. His next action showed the development of a resolution, for he pushed forward two chairs for Margery and myself. \"Sit down, both of you,\" he directed. \"I've got a lot to say, and I want you both to listen. When Margery has heard the whole story, she will probably despise me for the rest of her life. I can't help it. I've got to tell all I know, and it isn't so much after all.

But he couldn't make me tell who killed Mr. Fleming, because, before God, I didn't know.\" \"I have to go back to the night Miss Jane disappeared--and that's another thing that has driven me desperate.

It was too early to tell my suspicions. \"The things that looked black against me were bad enough, but they had nothing to do with Miss Jane.

Burton listened while he ate, and his cheerful comments were welcome enough after the depression of the last few days. I told him, after some hesitation, the whole thing, beginning with the Maitland pearls and ending with my drop down the dumb-waiter. I knew I was absolutely safe in doing so: there is no person to whom I would rather tell a secret than a newspaper man. He will go out of his way to keep it: he will lock it in the depths of his bosom, and keep it until seventy times seven. Also, you may threaten the rack or offer a larger salary, the seal does not come off his lips until the word is given. If then he makes a scarehead of it, and gets in three columns of space and as many photographs, it is his just reward. So--I told Burton everything, and he ate enough beefsteak for two men, and missed not a word I said. \"The money Wardrop had in the grip--that's easy enough explained,\" he said. \"Fleming used the Borough Bank to deposit state funds in. He must have known it was rotten: he and Clarkson were as thick as thieves.

Once I had restored the circulation to my hands by rubbing the wrists vigorously, I was able to undo the gag. One or two full breaths did a lot for me. Very soon I had undone the last knot, though even then it was some time before I could stand on my feet, but at last I stood erect, swinging my arms to and fro to restore the circulation, and wishing above all things that I could get hold of something to eat. I waited about a quarter of an hour, to be quite sure of my recovered strength. Then I tiptoed noiselessly to the door. As I had hoped, it was not locked, only latched. I unlatched it and peeped cautiously out. Everything was still. The moonlight came in through a window and showed me the dusty uncarpeted staircase. Cautiously I crept down it. Still no sound—but as I stood on the landing below, a faint murmur of voices reached me. I stopped dead and stood there for some time.

The fact is, we've treated him abominably. Of course, things did look black against him. I don't see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we did. Still, there it is, we were in the wrong, and now there's a beastly feeling that one ought to make amends; which is difficult, when one doesn't like the fellow a bit better than one did before. The whole thing's damned awkward! And I'm thankful he's had the tact to take himself off. It's a good thing Styles wasn't the mater's to leave to him. Couldn't bear to think of the fellow lording it here. He's welcome to her money.\" \"You'll be able to keep up the place all right?\" I asked. \"Oh, yes. There are the death duties, of course, but half my father's money goes with the place, and Lawrence will stay with us for the present, so there is his share as well. We shall be pinched at first, of course, because, as I once told you, I am in a bit of a hole financially myself.

Newspapers which had hinted at a general strike, and the inauguration of a reign of terror, were forced to hide their diminished heads. The bolder and more astute among them sought to prove that peace had been effected by following their counsels. In the Sunday papers a brief notice of the sudden death of Sir James Peel Edgerton, the famous K.C., had appeared. Monday's paper dealt appreciatively with the dead man's career. The exact manner of his sudden death was never made public. Tommy had been right in his forecast of the situation. It had been a one-man show. Deprived of their chief, the organization fell to pieces. Kramenin had made a precipitate return to Russia, leaving England early on Sunday morning. The gang had fled from Astley Priors in a panic, leaving behind, in their haste, various damaging documents which compromised them hopelessly. With these proofs of conspiracy in their hands, aided further by a small brown diary taken from the pocket of the dead man which had contained a full and damning résumé of the whole plot, the Government had called an eleventh-hour conference. The Labour leaders were forced to recognize that they had been used as a cat's paw. Certain concessions were made by the Government, and were eagerly accepted. It was to be Peace, not War! But the Cabinet knew by how narrow a margin they had escaped utter disaster. And burnt in on Mr. Carter's brain was the strange scene which had taken place in the house in Soho the night before. He had entered the squalid room to find that great man, the friend of a lifetime, dead--betrayed out of his own mouth. From the dead man's pocket-book he had retrieved the ill-omened draft treaty, and then and there, in the presence of the other three, it had been reduced to ashes.... England was saved!

It was Fleming who did it--I am sorry, Margery, but this is no time to mince words. It was Fleming who deposited the money in the wrecked banks, knowing what would happen. When the crash came, Butler's sureties, to save themselves, confiscated every dollar he had in the world. Butler went to the penitentiary for six months, on some minor count, and when he got out, after writing to Fleming and Schwartz, protesting his innocence, and asking for enough out of the fortune they had robbed him of to support his wife, he killed himself, at the White Cat.\" Margery was very pale, but quiet. She sat with her fingers locked in her lap, and her eyes on Wardrop. \"It was a bad business,\" Wardrop went on wearily. \"Fleming moved into Butler's place as treasurer, and took Lightfoot as his cashier. That kept the lid on. Once or twice, when there was an unexpected call for funds, the treasury was almost empty, and Schwartz carried things over himself. I went to Plattsburg as Mr. Fleming's private secretary when he became treasurer, and from the first I knew things were even worse than the average state government. \"Schwartz and Fleming had to hold together; they hated each other, and the feeling was trebled when Fleming married Schwartz's divorced wife.\" Margery looked at me with startled, incredulous eyes.

There was a silence, and then Tuppence burst out: \"Money, money, money! I think about money morning, noon and night!

Singleton as a suspect, the others to make sure of their presence at the trial. The murders took place on the morning of August 12. The Grand jury met late in September, and found an indictment against Singleton. The trial began on the 16th of November. The confinement was terrible. Accustomed to regular exercise as I was, I suffered mentally and physically. I had taken dinner at Bellwood before, and the memory was not hilarious. Miss Letitia was deaf, but chose to ignore the fact. With superb indifference she would break into the conversation with some wholly alien remark that necessitated a reassembling of one's ideas, making the meal a series of mental gymnastics. Miss Jane, through long practice, and because she only skimmed the surface of conversation, took her cerebral flights easily, but I am more unwieldy of mind. Nor was Miss Letitia's dominance wholly conversational. Her sister Jane was her creature, alternately snubbed and bullied. To Miss Letitia, Jane, in spite of her sixty-five years, was still a child, and sometimes a bad one. Indeed, many a child of ten is more sophisticated. Miss Letitia gave her expurgated books to read, and forbade her to read divorce court proceedings in the newspapers. Once, a recreant housemaid presenting the establishment with a healthy male infant, Jane was sent to the country for a month, and was only brought back when the house had been fumigated throughout. Poor Miss Jane! She met me with fluttering cordiality in the hall that night, safe in being herself for once, with the knowledge that Miss Letitia always received me from a throne-like horsehair sofa in the back parlor.

She was standing, her back to the dressing-stand, facing the door. She looked at me and made a helpless gesture with her hands, as if the situation were beyond her. Then I saw her look down. She took a quick step or two toward the door, and, stooping picked up some small object from almost under my foot. The incident would have passed without notice, had she not, in attempting to wrap it in her handkerchief, dropped it. I saw then that it was a key. \"Let me get it for you,\" I said. To my amazement, she put her foot over it. \"Please see what Mr. Turner is doing,\" she said. \"It is the key to my jewel-case.\" \"Will you let me see it?\" \"No.\" \"It is not the key to a jewel-case.\" \"It does not concern you what it is.\" \"It is the key to the storeroom door.\" \"You are stronger than I am.

And so defiantly she faced me, so valiant was every line of her slight figure, that I was ashamed of my impulse to push her aside and take it. I loved her with every inch of my overgrown body, and I did the thing she knew I would do. I bowed and left the cabin. But I had no intention of losing the key.

Sir Eustace had been driven off in an opposite direction accompanied by a strong guard. He waved his hand airily to us on departing. I came out on to the _stoep_ early on the following morning and looked across the veld in the direction of Johannesburg. I could see the great dumps glistening in the pale morning sunshine, and I could hear the low rumbling mutter of the guns. The Revolution was not over yet. The farmer's wife came out and called me in to breakfast. She was a kind, motherly soul, and I was already very fond of her. Harry had gone out at dawn and had not yet returned, so she informed me. Again I felt a stir of uneasiness pass over me. What was this shadow of which I was so conscious between us? After breakfast I sat out on the _stoep_, a book in my hand which I did not read. I was so lost in my own thoughts that I never saw Colonel Race ride up and dismount from his horse. It was not until he said \"Good morning, Anne,\" that I became aware of his presence. \"Oh,\" I said, with a flush, \"it's you.\" \"Yes. May I sit down?\" He drew a chair up beside me.

Miss Cowley left the delights (and drudgeries) of her home life early in the war and came up to London, where she entered an officers' hospital. First month: Washed up six hundred and forty-eight plates every day. Second month: Promoted to drying aforesaid plates. Third month: Promoted to peeling potatoes. Fourth month: Promoted to cutting bread and butter. Fifth month: Promoted one floor up to duties of wardmaid with mop and pail. Sixth month: Promoted to waiting at table. Seventh month: Pleasing appearance and nice manners so striking that am promoted to waiting on the Sisters! Eighth month: Slight check in career. Sister Bond ate Sister Westhaven's egg! Grand row! Wardmaid clearly to blame! Inattention in such important matters cannot be too highly censured. Mop and pail again! How are the mighty fallen! Ninth month: Promoted to sweeping out wards, where I found a friend of my childhood in Lieutenant Thomas Beresford (bow, Tommy! ), whom I had not seen for five long years. The meeting was affecting! Tenth month: Reproved by matron for visiting the pictures in company with one of the patients, namely: the aforementioned Lieutenant Thomas Beresford. Eleventh and twelfth months: Parlourmaid duties resumed with entire success. At the end of the year left hospital in a blaze of glory. After that, the talented Miss Cowley drove successively a trade delivery van, a motor-lorry and a general! The last was the pleasantest. He was quite a young general!\" \"What blighter was that?\" inquired Tommy. \"Perfectly sickening the way those brass hats drove from the War Office to the _Savoy_, and from the _Savoy_ to the War Office!\" \"I've forgotten his name now,\" confessed Tuppence. \"To resume, that was in a way the apex of my career.

He slipped his hand into his pocket. \"Checkmate to the Young Adventurers,\" he said, and slowly raised the big automatic. But, even as he did so, he felt himself seized from behind in a grip of iron. The revolver was wrenched from his hand, and the voice of Julius Hersheimmer said drawlingly: \"I guess you're caught redhanded with the goods upon you.\" The blood rushed to the K.C. 's face, but his self-control was marvellous, as he looked from one to the other of his two captors. He looked longest at Tommy. \"You,\" he said beneath his breath. \"_You!_ I might have known.\" Seeing that he was disposed to offer no resistance, their grip slackened. Quick as a flash his left hand, the hand which bore the big signet ring, was raised to his lips.... \"‘_Ave, Cæsar! te morituri salutant_,'\" he said, still looking at Tommy. Then his face changed, and with a long convulsive shudder he fell forward in a crumpled heap, whilst an odour of bitter almonds filled the air. THE supper party given by Mr. Julius Hersheimmer to a few friends on the evening of the 30th will long be remembered in catering circles. It took place in a private room, and Mr. Hersheimmer's orders were brief and forcible. He gave carte blanche--and when a millionaire gives carte blanche he usually gets it! Every delicacy out of season was duly provided. Waiters carried bottles of ancient and royal vintage with loving care.

We will look at the chest, although—but no matter—we will examine it all the same.\" We entered the house by one of the windows. There was no one in the hall, and we went straight up to the attic. Sure enough, there was the chest, a fine old piece, all studded with brass nails, and full to overflowing with every imaginable type of garment. Poirot bundled everything out on the floor with scant ceremony. There were one or two green fabrics of varying shades; but Poirot shook his head over them all. He seemed somewhat apathetic in the search, as though he expected no great results from it. Suddenly he gave an exclamation. \"What is it?\" \"Look!\" The chest was nearly empty, and there, reposing right at the bottom, was a magnificent black beard. \"_Ohó!_\" said Poirot. \"_Ohó!_\" He turned it over in his hands, examining it closely. \"New,\" he remarked. \"Yes, quite new.\" After a moment's hesitation, he replaced it in the chest, heaped all the other things on top of it as before, and made his way briskly downstairs. He went straight to the pantry, where we found Dorcas busily polishing her silver. Poirot wished her good morning with Gallic politeness, and went on: \"We have been looking through that chest, Dorcas. I am much obliged to you for mentioning it.

The place was full, and they wandered about looking for a table, catching odds and ends of conversation as they did so. \"And--do you know, she sat down and _cried_ when I told her she couldn't have the flat after all.\" \"It was simply a _bargain_, my dear! Just like the one Mabel Lewis brought from Paris----\" \"Funny scraps one does overhear,\" murmured Tommy. \"I passed two Johnnies in the street to-day talking about some one called Jane Finn. Did you ever hear such a name?\" But at that moment two elderly ladies rose and collected parcels, and Tuppence deftly ensconced herself in one of the vacant seats. Tommy ordered tea and buns. Tuppence ordered tea and buttered toast. \"And mind the tea comes in separate teapots,\" she added severely. Tommy sat down opposite her. His bared head revealed a shock of exquisitely slicked-back red hair. His face was pleasantly ugly--nondescript, yet unmistakably the face of a gentleman and a sportsman. His brown suit was well cut, but perilously near the end of its tether. They were an essentially modern-looking couple as they sat there. Tuppence had no claim to beauty, but there was character and charm in the elfin lines of her little face, with its determined chin and large, wide-apart grey eyes that looked mistily out from under straight, black brows. She wore a small bright green toque over her black bobbed hair, and her extremely short and rather shabby skirt revealed a pair of uncommonly dainty ankles.

I have ascertained that anyone in the household, with the exception of Mrs. Cavendish, who was playing tennis with you, could have personated Mr. Inglethorp on Monday evening. In the same way, we have his statement that he put the coffee down in the hall. No one took much notice of that at the inquest—but now it has a very different significance. We must find out who did take that coffee to Mrs. Inglethorp eventually, or who passed through the hall whilst it was standing there. From your account, there are only two people whom we can positively say did not go near the coffee—Mrs. Cavendish, and Mademoiselle Cynthia.\" \"Yes, that is so.\" I felt an inexpressible lightening of the heart. Mary Cavendish could certainly not rest under suspicion. \"In clearing Alfred Inglethorp,\" continued Poirot, \"I have been obliged to show my hand sooner than I intended.

One by one, I looked in their faces--at Burns, youngest member of the crew, a blue-eyed, sandy-haired Scot; at Clarke and Adams and Charlie Jones, old in the service of the Turner line; at McNamara, a shrewd little Irishman; at Oleson the Swede. And, in spite of myself, I could not help comparing them with the heavy-shouldered, sodden-faced man below in his cabin, the owner of the ship. One explanation came to me, and I leaped at it--the possibility of a stowaway hidden in the hold, some maniacal fugitive who had found in the little cargo boat's empty hull ample room to hide. The men, too, seized at the idea. One and all volunteered for what might prove to be a dangerous service. I chose Charlie Jones and Clarke as being most familiar with the ship, and we went down into the hold. Clarke carried a lantern. Charlie Jones held Singleton's broken revolver. I carried a belaying pin. But, although we searched every foot of space, we found nothing. The formaldehyde with which Turner had fumigated the ship clung here tenaciously, and, mixed with the odors of bilge water and the indescribable heavy smells left by tropical cargoes, made me dizzy and ill.  We were stumbling along, Clarke with the lantern, I next, and Charlie Jones behind, on our way to the ladder again, when I received a stunning blow on the back of the head. I turned dizzy, expecting nothing less than sudden death, when it developed that Jones, having stumbled over a loose plank, had fallen forward, the revolver in his outstretched hand striking my head. He picked himself up sheepishly, and we went on. But so unnerved was I by this fresh shock that it was a moment or two before I could essay the ladder.

It was dusty and showed little signs of having been occupied. The Dutchman made a mock bow and withdrew, closing the door behind him. I was quite helpless. Turn and twist as I would, I could not loosen my hands in the slightest degree, and the gag prevented me from crying out. If, by any possible chance, any one did come to the house, I could do nothing to attract their attention. Down below I heard the sound of a door shutting. Evidently the Dutchman was going out. It was maddening not to be able to do anything. I strained again at my bonds, but the knots held. I desisted at last, and either fainted or fell asleep. When I awoke I was in pain all over. It was quite dark now, and I judged that the night must be well advanced, for the moon was high in the heavens and shining down through the dusty skylight. The gag was half choking me and the stiffness and pain were unendurable. It was then that my eyes fell on a bit of broken glass lying in the corner. A moonbeam slanted right down on it, and its glistening had caught my attention. As I looked at it, an idea came into my head. My arms and legs were helpless, but surely I could still _roll._ Slowly and awkwardly, I set myself in motion. It was not easy.

Unfortunately, the desire and the ability have not yet happened to coincide. I took the evening train to Bellwood, and got there shortly after eight, in the midst of the Sunday evening calm, and the calm of a place like Bellwood is the peace of death without the hope of resurrection. I walked slowly up the main street, which was lined with residences; the town relegated its few shops to less desirable neighborhoods. My first intention had been to see the Episcopal minister, but the rectory was dark, and a burst of organ music from the church near reminded me again of the Sunday evening services. Promiscuous inquiry was not advisable. So far, Miss Jane's disappearance was known to very few, and Hunter had advised caution. I wandered up the street and turned at random to the right; a few doors ahead a newish red brick building proclaimed itself the post-office, and gave the only sign of life in the neighborhood. It occurred to me that here inside was the one individual who, theoretically at least, in a small place always knows the idiosyncrasies of its people. The door was partly open, for the spring night was sultry. I thought I heard something moving behind me in the cabin, and wheeled sharply, holding my revolver leveled. The idea had come to me that the crew had mutinied, and that every one in the after house had been killed. The idea made me frantic; I thought of the women, of Elsa Lee, and I was ready to kill. \"Where is the light switch?\" I demanded of Singleton, who was still on the companion steps, swaying. \"I don't know,\" he said, and collapsed, sitting huddled just above the captain's body, with his face in his hands.

Unfortunately one cannot entirely dispense with modern men. One is forced to have some kind of truck with butchers and bakers and milkmen and greengrocers. Therefore, Papa being immersed in the past, Mamma having died when I was a baby, it fell to me to undertake the practical side of living.

He took my coat and his own and hung them somewhere to dry.

You don't know what you're saying.\" \"I do. It solves everything.\" \"I'd never be able to look Race in the face again. I'll take my chance, but I'm damned if I'll let this slippery old fox get away. It's no good, Anne. I won't do it.\" Sir Eustace chuckled. He accepted defeat without the least emotion. \"Well, well,\" he remarked. \"You seem to have met your master, Anne. But I can assure you both that moral rectitude does not always pay.\" There was a crash of rending wood, and footsteps surged up the stairs. Harry drew back the bolt. Colonel Race was the first to enter the room. His face lit at the sight of us. \"You're safe, Anne. I was afraid— He turned to Sir Eustace. \"I've been after you for a long time, Pedler—and at last I've got you.\" \"Everybody seems to have gone completely mad,\" declared Sir Eustace airily. \"These young people have been threatening me with revolvers and accusing me of the most shocking things.

After that date her memory is as good as yours or mine.\" \"Then the first thing she remembers?\" \"Is landing with the survivors. Everything before that is a blank. She did not know her own name, or where she had come from, or where she was. She couldn't even speak her own tongue.\" \"But surely all this is most unusual?\" put in Julius. \"No, my dear sir. Quite normal under the circumstances. Severe shock to the nervous system. Loss of memory proceeds nearly always on the same lines. I suggested a specialist, of course. There's a very good man in Paris--makes a study of these cases--but Mrs. Vandemeyer opposed the idea of publicity that might result from such a course.\" \"I can imagine she would,\" said Sir James grimly. \"I fell in with her views. There is a certain notoriety given to these cases. And the girl was very young--nineteen, I believe. It seemed a pity that her infirmity should be talked about--might damage her prospects. Besides, there is no special treatment to pursue in such cases. It is really a matter of waiting.\" \"Waiting?\" \"Yes, sooner or later, the memory will return--as suddenly as it went. But in all probability the girl will have entirely forgotten the intervening period, and will take up life where she left off--at the sinking of the _Lusitania_.\" \"And when do you expect this to happen?\" The doctor shrugged his shoulders. \"Ah, that I cannot say. Sometimes it is a matter of months, sometimes it has been known to be as long as twenty years! Sometimes another shock does the trick. One restores what the other took away.\" \"Another shock, eh?\" said Julius thoughtfully. \"Exactly. There was a case in Colorado----\" The little man's voice trailed on, voluble, mildly enthusiastic. Julius did not seem to be listening. He had relapsed into his own thoughts and was frowning.

I had always believed that only the use of the fourth dimension in space would enable any one, not desired, to gain access to the Maitland house. \"Of money?\" \"Not money, although I had a good bit in the house.\" This also I knew. It was said of Miss Letitia that when money came into her possession it went out of circulation. \"Not--the pearls?\" I asked. She answered my question with another. \"When you had those pearls appraised for me at the jewelers last year, how many were there?\" \"Not quite one hundred. I think--yes, ninety-eight.\" \"Exactly,\" she corroborated, in triumph. \"They belonged to my mother. Margery's mother got some of them. That's a good many years ago, young man. They are worth more than they were then--a great deal more.\" \"Twenty-two thousand dollars,\" I repeated. \"You remember, Miss Letitia, that I protested vigorously at the time against your keeping them in the house.\" Miss Letitia ignored this, but before she went on she repeated again her cat-like pouncing at the door, only to find the hall empty as before. This time when she sat down it was knee to knee with me. \"Yesterday morning,\" she said gravely, \"I got down the box; they have always been kept in the small safe in the top of my closet. When Jane found a picture of my niece, Margery Fleming, in Harry's room, I thought it likely there was some truth in the gossip Jane heard about the two, and--if there was going to be a wedding--why, the pearls were to go to Margery anyhow. But--I found the door of the safe unlocked and a little bit open--and ten of the pearls were gone!\" \"Gone!\" I echoed. \"Ten of them! Why, it's ridiculous! If ten, why not the whole ninety-eight?\" \"How do I know?\" she replied with asperity. \"That's what I keep a lawyer for: that's why I sent for you.\" For the second time in two days I protested the same thing. \"But you need a detective,\" I cried. \"If you can find"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "The coroner led the way at once to the locked wing, and with the aid of one of the detectives examined the rooms and the body.

I received them in the living-room, and I had made up my mind exactly what to tell. I had taken the house for the summer, I said, while the Armstrongs were in California. In spite of a rumor among the servants about strange noises--I cited Thomas--nothing had occurred the first two nights. On the third night I believed that some one had been in the house: I had heard a crashing sound, but being alone with one maid had not investigated. The house had been locked in the morning and apparently undisturbed. Then, as clearly as I could, I related how, the night before, a shot had roused us; that my niece and I had investigated and found a body; that I did not know who the murdered man was until Mr. Jarvis from the club informed me, and that I knew of no reason why Mr. Arnold Armstrong should steal into his father's house at night. I should have been glad to allow him entree there at any time. \"Have you reason to believe, Miss Innes,\" the coroner asked, \"that any member of your household, imagining Mr. Armstrong was a burglar, shot him in self-defense?\" \"I have no reason for thinking so,\" I said quietly. \"Your theory is that Mr. Armstrong was followed here by some enemy, and shot as he entered the house?\" \"I don't think I have a theory,\" I said. \"The thing that has puzzled me is why Mr. Armstrong should enter his father's house two nights in succession, stealing in like a thief, when he needed only to ask entrance to be admitted.\" The coroner was a very silent man: he took some notes after this, but he seemed anxious"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "\"Then,\" I said, to bring Wardrop back to his story, \"you found you had been robbed of the money, and you went in to tell Mr. Fleming.

He was desperate, and I took his revolver from him.\" Margery had put her hands over her eyes. It was a terrible strain for her, but when I suggested that she wait for the rest of the story she refused vehemently. \"I came back here to Bellwood, and the first thing I learned was about Miss Jane. When I saw the blood print on the stair rail, I thought she was murdered, and I had more than I could stand. I took the letters out of the secret closet, before I could show it to you and Hunter, and later I put them in the leather bag I gave you, and locked it. You have it, haven't you, Knox?\" I nodded. \"As for that night at the club, I told the truth then, but not all the truth. I suppose I am a coward, but I was afraid to. If you knew Schwartz, you would understand.\" With the memory of his huge figure and the heavy under-shot face that I had seen the night before, I could understand very well, knowing Wardrop. \"I went to that room at the White Cat that night, because I was afraid not to go. Fleming might kill himself or some one else. I went up the stairs, slowly, and I heard no shot. At the door I hesitated, then opened it quietly. The door into the built-in staircase was just closing. It must have taken me only an instant to realize what had happened. Fleming was swaying forward as I caught him. I jumped to the staircase and looked down, but I was too late.

In answer to a quick command, the girl went forward to take her place in the boat. \"TOMMY, old thing!\" \"Tuppence, old bean!\" The two young people greeted each other affectionately, and momentarily blocked the Dover Street Tube exit in doing so.

No one paid any attention to us. Bare tables, a wooden floor, and almost as many cuspidors as chairs, comprised the furniture of the long room. In one corner was a battered upright piano, and there were two fireplaces with old-fashioned mantels. Perhaps a dozen men were sitting around, talking loudly, with much scraping of chairs on the bare floor. At one table they were throwing poker dice, but the rest were drinking beer and talking in a desultory way. At the piano a man with a red mustache was mimicking the sextette from _Lucia_ and a roar of applause met us as we entered the room. Hunter led the way to a corner and put down his bottles. \"It's fairly quiet to-night,\" he said. \"To-morrow's the big night--Saturday.\" \"What time do they close up?\" I asked.

The rest of the crew, except Oleson, on guard over the mate, was detailed to assist in carrying up the three bodies. Williams was taken along to get sheets from the linen room. We brought the captain up first, laying him on a sheet on the deck and folding the edges over him. It was terrible work. Even I, fresh from a medical college, grew nauseated over it. He was heavy. It was slow work, getting him up. Vail we brought up in the sheets from his bunk. Of the three, he was the most mutilated. The maid Karen showed only one injury, a smashing blow on the head, probably from the head of the axe. For axe it had been, beyond a doubt. I put Williams to work below to clear away every evidence of what had happened. He went down, ashy-faced, only to rush up again, refusing to stay alone. I sent Clarke with him, and instructed Charlie Jones to keep them there until the cabin was in order. At three bells the cook brought coffee, and some of the men took it.

Underneath was a small object, which he passed to me with care. \"I got it from the coroner's physician, who performed the autopsy,\" he said casually. \"You will notice that it is a thirty-two, and that the revolver they took from Wardrop was a thirty-eight.

My candlestick had rolled under the table, and after crawling around on my hands and knees, I found it. I had lost, I suppose, three or four minutes, and I was raging at my awkwardness and stupidity. No one, however, seemed to have heard the noise. For all her boasted watchfulness, Miss Letitia must have been asleep. I got back into the hall and from there to the dining-room. Some one was fumbling at the shutters there, and as I looked they swung open. It was so dark outside, with the trees and the distance from the street, that only the creaking of the shutter told it had opened. I stood in the middle of the room, with one hand firmly clutching my candlestick. But the window refused to move. The burglar seemed to have no proper tools; he got something under the sash, but it snapped, and through the heavy plate-glass I could hear him swearing. Then he abruptly left the window and made for the front of the house. I blundered in the same direction, my unshod feet striking on projecting furniture and causing me agonies, even through my excitement. When I reached the front door, however, I was amazed to find it unlocked, and standing open perhaps an inch. I stopped uncertainly. I was in a peculiar position; not even the most ardent admirers of antique brass candlesticks indorse them as weapons of offense or defense. But, there seeming to be nothing else to do, I opened the door quietly and stepped out into the darkness. Slowly, too--it was a new business for me--I was forming a theory of my own. It was a strange one, but it seemed to fit the facts as I knew them. With the story Wardrop told that afternoon came my first glimmer of light.

When I finished he got up and went into an inner room. He came back in a moment. \"I want you to come in and tell that to the chief,\" he said, and led the way. All told, I repeated my story three times that afternoon, to the sergeant, to the chief of police, and the third time to both the others and two detectives. The second time the chief made notes of what I said. \"Know this man Ladley?\" he asked the others. None of them did, but they all knew of Jennie Brice, and some of them had seen her in the theater. \"Get the theater, Tom,\" the chief said to one of the detectives. Luckily, what he learned over the telephone from the theater corroborated my story. Jennie Brice was not in the cast that week, but should have reported that morning (Monday) to rehearse the next week's piece. No message had been received from her, and a substitute had been put in her place.

With my hand on the door, I hesitated--then, with Hunter's injunction ringing in my ears, I opened it and looked in. A breath of cool night air from an open window met me. There was no noise, no smoke, no sour odor of stale beer. A table had been drawn to the center of the small room, and was littered with papers, pen and ink. At one corner was a tray, containing the remnants of a meal; a pillow and a pair of blankets on a couch at one side showed the room had been serving as a bedchamber.

I coughed, and receiving no answer, stepped into the room. \"I beg your pardon,\" I said, \"but I am looking, for--\"  Then the truth burst on me, overwhelmed me. A thin stream was spreading over the papers on the table, moving slowly, sluggishly, as is the way with blood when the heart pump is stopped. I hurried over and raised the heavy, wobbling, gray head. It was Allan Fleming and he had been shot through the forehead. My first impulse was to rouse the house; my second, to wait for Hunter. To turn loose that mob of half-drunken men in such a place seemed profanation. There was nothing of the majesty or panoply of death here, but the very sordidness of the surroundings made me resolve to guard the new dignity of that figure. I was shocked, of course; it would be absurd to say that I was emotionally unstrung. On the contrary, I was conscious of a distinct feeling of disappointment.

I could fairly see her revolving my detestable figures in her mind. Miss Letitia presided over the table in garrulous majesty. The two old ladies picked at their food, and Miss Jane had a spot of pink in each withered cheek. Margery Fleming made a brave pretense, but left her plate almost untouched.

I should have enjoyed telling him what I thought of his unwarranted interference. Had I not distinctly told him that I had no intention of seeing the girl? Decidedly, one's friends can be too zealous! But where was the lady? I set aside my wrath, and tried to puzzle it out. Evidently, through inadvertence, she had named the wrong hotel. Then another thought struck me. Was it inadvertence? Or had she deliberately withheld her name and given me the wrong address? The more I thought about it, the more I felt convinced that this last surmise of mine was right. For some reason or other she did not wish to let the acquaintance ripen into friendship.

He was dead then.\" \"Where is the revolver?\" \"I will turn it over to the coroner.\" \"You will give it to me,\" Hunter replied sharply.

Two chambers were empty. \"And you waited--say ten minutes, before you called for help, and even then you went outside hunting a doctor! What were you doing in those ten minutes?\" Wardrop shut his lips and refused to reply. \"If Mr. Fleming shot himself,\" the detective pursued relentlessly, \"there would be powder marks around the wound.

Miss Letitia received me as usual, in the back parlor. Miss Fleming was there also, sewing by a window, and in her straight white dress with her hair drawn back and braided around her head, she looked even younger than before. There was no time for conversation. Miss Letitia launched at once into the extravagance of both molasses and butter on the colored orphans' bread and after a glance at me, and a quick comprehension from my face that I had no news for her, the girl at the window bent over her sewing again. \"Molasses breeds worms,\" Miss Letitia said decisively. \"So does pork.

The nails were broken and discoloured, and the skin was hard. It hardly enlightened me as much as I should have liked it to have done.

On the other hand, if the news of my escape were wired to Chichester, and also the information that I had left Cape Town for Durban, nothing was simpler for him than to leave the boat at either Port Elizabeth or East London and so give me the slip completely.

Charlie Jones, always an influence among the men, voiced the situation as we all stood together in the chill morning air: \"What we want to do, boys,\" he said, \"is to make for the nearest port."}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "Miss Letitia ate it resignedly. \"Like as not I'll break out, I did the last time,\" she said gloomily. \"I only hope I don't break out in colors.\" The meal was over finally, but if I had hoped for another word alone with Margery Fleming that evening, I was foredoomed to disappointment. Letitia sent the girl, not ungently, to bed, and ordered Jane out of the room with a single curt gesture toward the door. \"You'd better wash those cups yourself, Jane,\" she said. \"I don't see any sense anyhow in getting out the best china unless there's real company. Besides, I'm going to talk business.\" Poor, meek, spiritless Miss Jane! The situation was absurd in spite of its pathos. She confided to me once that never in her sixty-five years of life had she bought herself a gown, or chosen the dinner. She was snubbed with painstaking perseverance, and sent out of the room when subjects requiring frank handling were under discussion. She was as unsophisticated as a child of ten, as unworldly as a baby, as--well, poor Miss Jane, again. When the door had closed behind her, Miss Letitia listened for a moment, got up suddenly and crossing the room with amazing swiftness for her years, pounced on the knob and threw it open again. But the passage was empty; Miss Jane's slim little figure was disappearing into the kitchen. The older sister watched her out of sight, and then returned to her sofa without deigning explanation. \"I didn't want to see you about the will, Mr. Knox,\" she began without prelude. \"The will can wait. I ain't going to die just yet--not if I know anything. But although I think you'd look a heap better and more responsible if you wore some hair on your face, still in most things I think you're a man of sense. And you're not too young. That's why I didn't send for Harry Wardrop; he's too young.\" I winced at that. Miss Letitia leaned forward and put her bony hand on my knee. \"I've been robbed,\" she announced in a half"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "I met Hunter on my way to the station, and he turned around and walked with me. \"So you've lain down on the case!\" I said, when we had gone a few steps without speaking. He grumbled something unintelligible and probably unrepeatable. \"Of course,\" I persisted, \"being a simple and uncomplicated case of suicide, there was nothing in it anyhow. If it had been a murder, under peculiar circumstances--\"  He stopped and gripped my arm. \"For ten cents,\" he said gravely, \"I would tell the chief and a few others what I think of them. And then I'd go out and get full.\" \"Not on ten cents!\" \"I'm going out of the business,\" he stormed. \"I'm going to drive a garbage wagon: it's cleaner than this job. Suicide! I never saw a cleaner case of--\" He stopped suddenly. \"Do you know Burton--of the _Times-Post_?\" \"No: I've heard of him.\" \"Well, he's your man. They're dead against the ring, and Burton's been given the case. He's as sharp as a steel trap. You two get together.\" He paused at a corner. \"Good-by,\" he said dejectedly. \"I'm off to hunt some boys that have been stealing milk bottles. That's about my size, these days.\" He turned around, however, before he had gone many steps and came back. \"Wardrop has been missing since yesterday afternoon,\" he said. \"That is, he thinks he's missing. We've got him all right.\" I gave up my Bellwood visit for the time, and taking a car down-town, I went to the _Times-Post_ office. The Monday morning edition was already under way, as far as the staff was concerned, and from the waiting-room I could see three or four men, with their hats on, most of them rattling typewriters. Burton came in in a moment, a red-haired young fellow, with a short thick nose and a muggy skin. He was rather stocky in build, and the pugnacity of his features did not hide the shrewdness of his eyes. I introduced myself, and at my name his perfunctory manner changed. \"Knox!\" he said. \"I called you last night over"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "I could easily have written them myself, and the probabilities were that Papa would never have learnt of the transaction, not being a reader of the _Daily Budget._ However, I rejected this course as being too risky, so I merely put on my best hat and went sadly down the village to interview our justly irate grocer. The reporter from the _Daily Budget_ was the only young man who ever came to our house. There were times when I envied Emily, our little servant, who \"walked out\" whenever occasion offered with a large sailor to whom she was affianced. In between times, to \"keep her hand in\" as she expressed it, she walked out with the greengrocer's young man, and the chemist's assistant. I reflected sadly that I had no one to \"keep my hand in\" with. All Papa's friends were aged Professors—usually with long beards. It is true that Professor Peterson once clasped me affectionately and said I had a \"neat little waist\" and then tried to kiss me. The phrase alone dated him hopelessly. No self-respecting female has had a \"neat little waist\" since I was in my cradle. I yearned for adventure, for love, for romance, and I seemed condemned to an existence of drab utility. The village possessed a lending library, full of tattered works of fiction, and I enjoyed perils and love-making at second hand, and went to sleep dreaming of stern, silent Rhodesians, and of strong men who always \"felled their opponent with a single blow.\" There was no one in the village who even looked as though he could \"fell\" an opponent, with a single blow or with several. There was the Kinema too, with a weekly episode of \"The Perils of Pamela.\" Pamela was a magnificent young woman. Nothing daunted her. She fell out of aeroplanes, adventured in submarines, climbed skyscrapers and crept about in the Underworld without turning a hair.

I see very well. And you are wise. Stick to what you have said.\" \"That seems to be your invariable advice,\" I remarked, rather piqued. \"Ah, my friend, have faith in Papa Poirot. Some day, if you permit, I will arrange you a marriage of great suitability.\" \"Thank you,\" I said laughing, \"but the prospect leaves me cold.\" Poirot sighed and shook his head. \"_Les Anglais!___\" he murmured. \"No method—absolutely none whatever. They leave all to chance!\" He frowned, and altered the position of the salt cellar. \"Mademoiselle Cinderella is staying at the Hôtel d'Angleterre you told me, did you not?\" \"No. Hôtel du Phare.\" \"True, I forgot.\" A moment's misgiving shot across my mind. Surely I had never mentioned any hotel to Poirot. I looked across at him, and felt reassured. He was cutting his bread into neat little squares, completely absorbed in his task. He must have fancied I had told him where the girl was staying. We had coffee outside facing the sea. Poirot smoked one of his tiny cigarettes, and then drew his watch from his pocket. \"The train to Paris leaves at 2:25,\" he observed. \"I should be starting.\" \"Paris?\" I cried. \"That is what I said, _mon ami___.\" \"You are going to Paris?

Throw together a boy young Renauld and a beautiful girl like Mademoiselle Marthe, and the result is almost inevitable. Then, the quarrel!

So I made my guess—and I was right.\" \"And that was why you warned me against setting my heart on the lady? You already suspected that she loved young Renauld?\" Poirot smiled. \"At any rate—_I saw that she had anxious eyes.___ That is how always think of Mademoiselle Daubreuil _as the girl with the anxious eyes. ...___\" His voice was so grave that it impressed me uncomfortably. \"What do you mean by that, Poirot?\" \"I fancy, my friend, that we shall see before very long.

I knew then. How dull I had been, and stupid! The men caught her meaning, too, and we tramped heavily forward, the girl and I leading. The door into the captain's room was open, and the axe was gone from the bunk. The key, with the cord that Burns had worn around his neck, was in the door, the string torn and pulled as if it had been jerked away from the unconscious man. Later on we verified this by finding, on the back of Burns's neck an abraded line two inches or so in length. It was a strong cord--the kind a sailor pins his faith to, and uses indiscriminately to hold his trousers or his knife. I ordered a rigid search of the deck, but the axe was gone. Nor was it ever found. It had taken its bloody story many fathoms deep into the old Atlantic, and hidden it, where many crimes have been hidden, in the ooze and slime of the sea-bottom. That day was memorable for more than the attack on Burns. It marked a complete revolution in my idea of the earlier crimes, and of the criminal. Two things influenced my change of mental attitude. The attack on Burns was one. I did not believe that Turner had strength enough to fell so vigorous a man, even with the capstan bar which we found lying near by. Nor could he have jerked and broken the amberline. Mrs. Johns I eliminated for the same reason, of course. I could imagine her getting the key by subtlety, wheedling the impressionable young sailor into compliance. But force! The second reason was the stronger. Singleton, the mate, had become a tractable and almost amiable prisoner.

You fellows have been mighty careful to destroy the evidence, haven't you?\" All that long day we made our deliberate progress up the river. The luggage from the after house was carried up on deck by Adams and Clarke, and stood waiting for the customhouse. Turner, his hands behind him, paced the deck hour by hour, his heavy face colorless. His wife, dark, repressed, with a look of being always on guard, watched him furtively. Mrs. Johns, dressed in black, talked to the doctor; and, from the notes he made, I knew she was telling the story of the tragedy. And here, there, and everywhere, efficient, normal, and so lovely that it hurt me to look at her, was Elsa. Williams, the butler, had emerged from his chrysalis of fright, and was ostentatiously looking after the family's comfort. No clearer indication could have been given of the new status of affairs than his changed attitude toward me. He came up to me, early in the afternoon, and demanded that I wash down the deck before the women came up. I smiled down at him cheerfully. \"Williams,\" I said, \"you are a coward--a mean, white-livered coward. You have skulked in the after house, behind women, when there was man's work to do. If I wash that deck, it will be with you as a mop.\" He blustered something about speaking to Mr. Turner and seeing that I did the work I was brought on board to do, and, seeing Turner's eye on us, finished his speech with an ugly epithet. My nerves were strained to the utmost: lack of sleep and food had done their work. I was no longer in command of the Ella; I was a common sailor, ready to vent my spleen through my fists.

When I listened again, the house-breaker had moved to another window, and was shaking it cautiously. With Miss Letitia's story of the pearls fresh in my mind, I felt at once that the thief, finding his ten a prize, had come back for more. My first impulse was to go to the head of my bed, where I am accustomed to keep a revolver. With the touch of the tall corner post, however, I remembered that I was not at home, and that it was not likely there was a weapon in the house. Finally, after knocking over an ornament that shattered on the hearth and sounded like the crash of doom, I found on the mantel a heavy brass candlestick, and with it in my hand I stepped into the gloom of the hallway and felt my way to the stairs. There were no night lights; the darkness was total. I found the stairs before I expected to, and came within an ace of pitching down, headlong. I had kicked off my shoes--a fact which I regretted later. Once down the stairs I was on more familiar territory. I went at once into the library, which was beneath my room, but the sounds at the window had ceased. I thought I heard steps on the walk, going toward the front of the house.

Gertrude was locked in her room with a headache, and I had luncheon alone.

He ate what was put before him in an exemplary fashion, but seemed mildly pained when the question of paying for it arose. We never seemed to have any money. His celebrity was not of the kind that brought in a cash return. Although he was a fellow of almost every important society, and had rows of letters after his name, the general public scarcely knew of his existence, and his long learned books, though adding signally to the sum-total of human knowledge, had no attraction for the masses. Only on one occasion did he leap into the public gaze. He had read a paper before some society on the subject of the young of the chimpanzee. The young of the human race show some anthropoid features, whereas the young of the chimpanzee approach more nearly to the human than the adult chimpanzee does. That seems to show that whereas our ancestors were more Simian than we are, the chimpanzee's were of a higher type than the present species—in other words, the chimpanzee is a degenerate. That enterprising newspaper, the _Daily Budget,_ being hard up for something spicy, immediately brought itself out with large headlines. \"We are not descended from monkeys, but are monkeys descended from _us?_ Eminent Professor says chimpanzees are decadent humans.\" Shortly afterwards a reporter called to see Papa, and endeavoured to induce him to write a series of popular articles on the theory.

The vicar's consolations, though well meant, did not console me in the least. It took some time to dawn upon me that the thing I had always longed for—freedom—was at last mine. I was an orphan, and practically penniless, but free. At the same time I realized the extraordinary kindness of all these good people. The vicar did his best to persuade me that his wife was in urgent need of a companion help. Our tiny local library suddenly made up its mind to have an assistant librarian. Finally, the doctor called upon me, and after making various ridiculous excuses for failing to send in a proper bill, he hummed and hawed a good deal and suddenly suggested that I should marry him. I was very much astonished. The doctor was nearer forty than thirty, and a round, tubby little man. He was not at all like the hero of \"The Perils of Pamela,\" and even less like a stern and silent Rhodesian. I reflected a minute and then asked him why he wanted to marry me.

Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty memory which haunts her, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a domestic tyrant. I have always felt that there was something singular and questionable in this man's character, but the adventure of last night brings all my suspicions to a head. And yet it may seem a small matter in itself. You are aware that I am not a very sound sleeper, and since I have been on guard in this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever. Last night, about two in the morning, I was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room. I rose, opened my door, and peeped out. A long black shadow was trailing down the corridor. It was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his hand. He was in shirt and trousers, with no covering to his feet. I could merely see the outline, but his height told me that it was Barrymore. He walked very slowly and circumspectly, and there was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance. I have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which runs round the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther side. I waited until he had passed out of sight and then I followed him. When I came round the balcony he had reached the end of the farther corridor, and I could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he had entered one of the rooms. Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and unoccupied so that his expedition became more mysterious than ever. The light shone steadily as if he were standing motionless. I crept down the passage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner of the door. Barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the glass. His profile was half turned towards me, and his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor. For some minutes he stood watching intently. Then he gave a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light. Instantly I made my way back to my room, and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing once more upon their return journey. Long afterwards when I had fallen into a light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere in a lock, but I could not tell whence the sound came. What it all means I cannot guess, but there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of.

MY DEAR HOLMES: If I was compelled to leave you without much news during the early days of my mission you must acknowledge that I am making up for lost time, and that events are now crowding thick and fast upon us. In my last report I ended upon my top note with Barrymore at the window, and now I have quite a budget already which will, unless I am much mistaken, considerably surprise you. Things have taken a turn which I could not have anticipated. In some ways they have within the last forty-eight hours become much clearer and in some ways they have become more complicated. But I will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself. Before breakfast on the morning following my adventure I went down the corridor and examined the room in which Barrymore had been on the night before. The western window through which he had stared so intently has, I noticed, one peculiarity above all other windows in the house--it commands the nearest outlook on to the moor. There is an opening between two trees which enables one from this point of view to look right down upon it, while from all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse which can be obtained. It follows, therefore, that Barrymore, since only this window would serve the purpose, must have been looking out for something or somebody upon the moor. The night was very dark, so that I can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone. It had struck me that it was possible that some love intrigue was on foot. That would have accounted for his stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness of his wife. The man is a striking-looking fellow, very well equipped to steal the heart of a country girl, so that this theory seemed to have something to support it. That opening of the door which I had heard after I had returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep some clandestine appointment. So I reasoned with myself in the morning, and I tell you the direction of my suspicions, however much the result may have shown that they were unfounded. But whatever the true explanation of Barrymore's movements might be, I felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself until I could explain them was more than I could bear. I had an interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast, and I told him all that I had seen. He was less surprised than I had expected. \"I knew that Barrymore walked about nights, and I had a mind to speak to him about it,\" said he. \"Two or three times I have heard his steps in the passage, coming and going, just about the hour you name.\" \"Perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular window,\" I suggested. \"Perhaps he does. If so, we should be able to shadow him and see what it is that he is after. I wonder what your friend Holmes would do if he were here.\" \"I believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest,\" said I. \"He would follow Barrymore and see what he did.\" \"Then we shall do it together.\" \"But surely he would hear us.\" \"The man is rather deaf, and in any case we must take our chance of that. We'll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he passes.\" Sir Henry rubbed his hands with pleasure, and it was evident that he hailed the adventure as a relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor. The baronet has been in communication with the architect who prepared the plans for Sir Charles, and with a contractor from London, so that we may expect great changes to begin here soon. There have been decorators and furnishers up from Plymouth, and it is evident that our friend has large ideas and means to spare no pains or expense to restore the grandeur of his family. When the house is renovated and refurnished, all that he will need will be a wife to make it complete. Between ourselves there are pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is willing, for I have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour, Miss Stapleton. And yet the course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as one would under the circumstances expect. Today, for example, its surface was broken by a very unexpected ripple, which has caused our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance. After the conversation which I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir Henry put on his hat and prepared to go out. As a matter of course I did the same. \"What, are you coming, Watson?\" he asked, looking at me in a curious way. \"That depends on whether you are going on the moor,\" said I. \"Yes, I am.\" \"Well, you know what my instructions are. I am sorry to intrude, but you heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not leave you, and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor.\" Sir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile. \"My dear fellow,\" said he, \"Holmes, with all his wisdom, did not foresee some things which have happened since I have been on the moor. You understand me? I am sure that you are the last man in the world who would wish to be a spoil-sport. I must go out alone.\" It put me in a most awkward position. I was at a loss what to say or what to do, and before I had made up my mind he picked up his cane and was gone. But when I came to think the matter over my conscience reproached me bitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of my sight. I imagined what my feelings would be if I had to return to you and to confess that some misfortune had occurred through my disregard for your instructions. I assure you my cheeks flushed at the very thought. It might not even now be too late to overtake him, so I set off at once in the direction of Merripit House. I hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing anything of Sir Henry, until I came to the point where the moor path branches off. There, fearing that perhaps I had come in the wrong direction after all, I mounted a hill from which I could command a view--the same hill which is cut into the dark quarry. Thence I saw him at once. He was on the moor path about a quarter of a mile off, and a lady was by his side who could only be Miss Stapleton. It was clear that there was already an understanding between them and that they had met by appointment. They were walking slowly along in deep conversation, and I saw her making quick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest in what she was saying, while he listened intently, and once or twice shook his head in strong dissent. I stood among the rocks watching them, very much puzzled as to what I should do next. To follow them and break into their intimate conversation seemed to be an outrage, and yet my clear duty was never for an instant to let him out of my sight. To act the spy upon a friend was a hateful task. Still, I could see no better course than to observe him from the hill, and to clear my conscience by confessing to him afterwards what I had done. It is true that if any sudden danger had threatened him I was too far away to be of use, and yet I am sure that you will agree with me that the position was very difficult, and that there was nothing more which I could do. Our friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted on the path and were standing deeply absorbed in their conversation, when I was suddenly aware that I was not the only witness of their interview. A wisp of green floating in the air caught my eye, and another glance showed me that it was carried on a stick by a man who was moving among the broken ground. It was Stapleton with his butterfly-net. He was very much closer to the pair than I was, and he appeared to be moving in their direction. At this instant Sir Henry suddenly drew Miss Stapleton to his side. His arm was round her, but it seemed to me that she was straining away from him with her face averted. He stooped his head to hers, and she raised one hand as if in protest. Next moment I saw them spring apart and turn hurriedly round. Stapleton was the cause of the interruption. He was running wildly towards them, his absurd net dangling behind him. He gesticulated and almost danced with excitement in front of the lovers. What the scene meant I could not imagine, but it seemed to me that Stapleton was abusing Sir Henry, who offered explanations, which became more angry as the other refused to accept them. The lady stood by in haughty silence. Finally Stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in a peremptory way to his sister, who, after an irresolute glance at Sir Henry, walked off by the side of her brother. The naturalist's angry gestures showed that the lady was included in his displeasure. The baronet stood for a minute looking after them, and then he walked slowly back the way that he had come, his head hanging, the very picture of dejection. What all this meant I could not imagine, but I was deeply ashamed to have witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend's knowledge. I ran down the hill therefore and met the baronet at the bottom. His face was flushed with anger and his brows were wrinkled, like one who is at his wit's ends what to do. \"Halloa, Watson! Where have you dropped from?\" said he. \"You don't mean to say that you came after me in spite of all?\" I explained everything to him: how I had found it impossible to remain behind, how I had followed him, and how I had witnessed all that had occurred. For an instant his eyes blazed at me, but my frankness disarmed his anger, and he broke at last into a rather rueful laugh. \"You would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe place for a man to be private,\" said he, \"but, by thunder, the whole countryside seems to have been out to see me do my wooing--and a mighty poor wooing at that! Where had you engaged a seat?\" \"I was on that hill.\" \"Quite in the back row, eh? But her brother was well up to the front. Did you see him come out on us?\" \"Yes, I did.\" \"Did he ever strike you as being crazy--this brother of hers?\" \"I can't say that he ever did.\" \"I dare say not. I always thought him sane enough until today, but you can take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a straitjacket. What's the matter with me, anyhow? You've lived near me for some weeks, Watson. Tell me straight, now! Is there anything that would prevent me from making a good husband to a woman that I loved?\" \"I should say not.\" \"He can't object to my worldly position, so it must be myself that he has this down on. What has he against me? I never hurt man or woman in my life that I know of. And yet he would not so much as let me touch the tips of her fingers.\" \"Did he say so?\" \"That, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I've only known her these few weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was made for me, and she, too--she was happy when she was with me, and that I'll swear. There's a light in a woman's eyes that speaks louder than words. But he has never let us get together and it was only today for the first time that I saw a chance of having a few words with her alone. She was glad to meet me, but when she did it was not love that she would talk about, and she wouldn't have let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it. She kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger, and that she would never be happy until I had left it. I told her that since I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it, and that if she really wanted me to go, the only way to work it was for her to arrange to go with me. With that I offered in as many words to marry her, but before she could answer, down came this brother of hers, running at us with a face on him like a madman. He was just white with rage, and those light eyes of his were blazing with fury. What was I doing with the lady? How dared I offer her attentions which were distasteful to her? Did I think that because I was a baronet I could do what I liked? If he had not been her brother I should have known better how to answer him. As it was I told him that my feelings towards his sister were such as I was not ashamed of, and that I hoped that she might honour me by becoming my wife. That seemed to make the matter no better, so then I lost my temper too, and I answered him rather more hotly than I should perhaps, considering that she was standing by. So it ended by his going off with her, as you saw, and here am I as badly puzzled a man as any in this county. Just tell me what it all means, Watson, and I'll owe you more than ever I can hope to pay.\" I tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I was completely puzzled myself. Our friend's title, his fortune, his age, his character, and his appearance are all in his favour, and I know nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which runs in his family. That his advances should be rejected so brusquely without any reference to the lady's own wishes and that the lady should accept the situation without protest is very amazing. However, our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from Stapleton himself that very afternoon. He had come to offer apologies for his rudeness of the morning, and after a long private interview with Sir Henry in his study the upshot of their conversation was that the breach is quite healed, and that we are to dine at Merripit House next Friday as a sign of it. \"I don't say now that he isn't a crazy man,\" said Sir Henry; \"I can't forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning, but I must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he has done.\" \"Did he give any explanation of his conduct?\" \"His sister is everything in his life, he says. That is natural enough, and I am glad that he should understand her value. They have always been together, and according to his account he has been a very lonely man with only her as a companion, so that the thought of losing her was really terrible to him. He had not understood, he said, that I was becoming attached to her, but when he saw with his own eyes that it was really so, and that she might be taken away from him, it gave him such a shock that for a time he was not responsible for what he said or did. He was very sorry for all that had passed, and he recognized how foolish and how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life. If she had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like myself than to anyone else. But in any case it was a blow to him and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself to meet it. He would withdraw all opposition upon his part if I would promise for three months to let the matter rest and to be content with cultivating the lady's friendship during that time without claiming her love. This I promised, and so the matter rests.\" So there is one of our small mysteries cleared up. It is something to have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we are floundering. We know now why Stapleton looked with disfavour upon his sister's suitor--even when that suitor was so eligible a one as Sir Henry. And now I pass on to another thread which I have extricated out of the tangled skein, the mystery of the sobs in the night, of the tear-stained face of Mrs. I'm not so light to"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "She dropped into a chair, and I thought Mr. Jamieson must have finished. But he was not through. \"You certainly clear your brother and Mr. Bailey admirably,\" he said. \"The testimony is invaluable, especially in view of the fact that your brother and Mr. Armstrong had, I believe, quarreled rather seriously some time ago.\" \"Nonsense,\" I broke in. \"Things are bad enough, Mr. Jamieson, without inventing bad feeling where it doesn't exist. Gertrude, I don't think Halsey knew the--the murdered man, did he?\" But Mr. Jamieson was sure of his ground. \"The quarrel, I believe,\" he persisted, \"was about Mr. Armstrong's conduct to you, Miss Gertrude. He had been paying you unwelcome attentions.\" And I had never seen the man! When she nodded a \"yes\" I saw the tremendous possibilities involved. If this detective could prove that Gertrude feared and disliked the murdered man, and that Mr. Armstrong had been annoying and possibly pursuing her with hateful attentions, all that, added to Gertrude's confession of her presence in the billiard-room at the time of the crime, looked strange, to say the least. The prominence of the family assured a strenuous effort to find the murderer, and if we had nothing worse to look forward to, we were sure of a distasteful publicity. Mr. Jamieson shut his note-book with a snap, and thanked us. \"I have an idea,\" he said, apropos of nothing at all, \"that at any rate the ghost is laid here. Whatever the rappings have been--and the colored man says they began when the family went west three months ago--they are likely to stop now.\" Which shows how much he knew about it. The ghost was not laid: with the murder of Arnold Armstrong he, or it, only seemed to take on fresh vigor. Mr. Jamieson left then, and when Gertrude had gone up-stairs, as she did at once, I sat and thought over what I had just heard. Her engagement, once so engrossing a matter, paled now beside the significance of her story. If Halsey and Jack Bailey had left before the crime, how came Halsey's revolver"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "I took it from her, and sent her up for dry garments. Her daylight courage and self-importance, and her shuddering delight in the mystery, irritated me beyond words. After I left her I made a circuit of the building. Nothing seemed to be disturbed: the house looked as calm and peaceful in the morning sun as it had the day I had been coerced into taking it. There was nothing to show that inside had been mystery and violence and sudden death. In one of the tulip beds back of the house an early blackbird was pecking viciously at something that glittered in the light. I picked my way gingerly over through the dew and stooped down: almost buried in the soft ground was a revolver! I scraped the earth off it with the tip of my shoe, and, picking it up, slipped it into my pocket. Not until I had got into my bedroom and double-locked the door did I venture to take it out and examine it. One look was all I needed. It was Halsey's revolver. I had unpacked it the day before and put it on his shaving-stand, and there could be no mistake. His name was on a small silver plate on the handle. I seemed to see a network closing around my boy, innocent as I knew he was. The revolver--I am afraid of them, but anxiety gave me courage to look through the barrel--the revolver had still two bullets in it. I could only breathe a prayer of thankfulness that I had found the revolver before any sharp-eyed detective had come around. I decided to keep what clues I had, the cuff-link, the golf-stick and the revolver, in a secure place until I could see some reason for displaying them. The cuff-link had been dropped into a little filigree box on my toilet table. I opened the box and felt around for it. The box was empty--the cuff-link had disappeared! At ten o'clock the Casanova hack brought up three men. They introduced themselves as the coroner of the county and two detectives from"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "I had rejected it as absurd, nevertheless it persisted. \"You couldn't call it a suspicion,\" I murmured. \"It's so utterly foolish.\" \"Come now,\" urged Poirot encouragingly. \"Do not fear. Speak your mind. You should always pay attention to your instincts.\" \"Well then,\" I blurted out, \"it's absurd—but I suspect Miss Howard of not telling all she knows!\" \"Miss Howard?\" \"Yes—you'll laugh at me— \"Not at all. Why should I?\" \"I can't help feeling,\" I continued blunderingly; \"that we've rather left her out of the possible suspects, simply on the strength of her having been away from the place. But, after all, she was only fifteen miles away. A car would do it in half an hour. Can we say positively that she was away from Styles on the night of the murder?\" \"Yes, my friend,\" said Poirot unexpectedly, \"we can. One of my first actions was to ring up the hospital where she was working.\" \"Well?\" \"Well, I learnt that Miss Howard had been on afternoon duty on Tuesday, and that—a convoy coming in unexpectedly—she had kindly offered to remain on night duty, which offer was gratefully accepted. That disposes of that.\" \"Oh!\" I said, rather nonplussed. \"Really,\" I continued, \"it's her extraordinary vehemence against Inglethorp that started me off suspecting her. I can't help feeling she'd do anything against him. And I had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the will. She might have burnt the new one, mistaking it for the earlier one in his favour. She is so terribly bitter against him.\" \"You consider her vehemence unnatural?\" \"Y—es. She is so very violent. I wondered really whether she is quite sane on that point.\" Poirot shook his head energetically. \"No, no, you are on a wrong tack there. There is nothing weak-minded or degenerate about Miss Howard. She is an excellent specimen of well-balanced English beef and brawn. She is sanity itself.\" \"Yet her hatred of Inglethorp seems almost a mania. My idea was—a very ridiculous one, no doubt—that she had intended to poison him—and that, in some way, Mrs. Inglethorp got hold"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "One of them was that of my Dutch friend, the other I could not for the moment recognize, though it seemed vaguely familiar. In the end I decided that it was clearly my duty to hear all I could. I must risk the Kafir boy waking up. I crossed the hall noiselessly and knelt by the study door. For a moment or two I could hear no better. The voices were louder, but I could not distinguish what they said. I applied my eye to the keyhole instead of my ear. As I had guessed, one of the speakers was the big Dutchman. The other man was sitting outside my circumscribed range of vision. Suddenly he rose to get himself a drink. His back, black clad and decorous, came into view. Even before he turned round I knew who he was. Mr. Chichester! Now I began to make out the words. \"All the same, it is dangerous. Suppose her friends come after her?\" It was the big man speaking. Chichester answered him. He had dropped his clerical voice entirely. No wonder I had not recognized it. \"All bluff. They haven't an idea where she is.\" \"She spoke very positively.\" \"I dare say. I've looked into the matter, and we've nothing to fear. Anyway, it's the ‘Colonel's' orders. You don't want to go against them, I suppose?\" The Dutchman ejaculated something in his own language. I judged it to be a hasty disclaimer. \"But why not knock her on the head?\" he growled. \"It would be simple. The boat is all ready. She could be taken out to sea?\" \"Yes,\" said Chichester meditatively. \"That is what I should do. She knows too much, that is certain. But the ‘Colonel' is a man who likes to play a lone hand—though no one else must do so.\" Something in his own words seemed to awaken a memory that annoyed him. \"He wants information of some kind from this girl.\" He had paused before the information, and the Dutchman was quick to catch him up. \"Information?\" \"Something of the kind.\" \"Diamonds,\" I said to"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "And now I come, with some hesitation, to the trial. Hesitation, because I relied on McWhirter to keep a record. And McWhirter, from his notes, appears to have been carried away at times by excitement, and either jotted down rows of unintelligible words, or waited until evening and made up his notes, like a woman's expense account, from a memory never noticeable for accuracy. At dawn, the morning after we anchored, Charlie Jones roused me, grinning. \"Friend of yours over the rail, Leslie,\" he said. \"Wants to take you ashore!\" I knew no one in Philadelphia except the chap who had taken me yachting once, and I felt pretty certain that he would not associate Leslie the football player with Leslie the sailor on the Ella. I went reluctantly to the rail, and looked down. Below me, just visible in the river mist of the early morning, was a small boat from which two men were looking up. One was McWhirter! \"Hello, old top,\" he cried. \"Or is it you behind that beard?\" \"It's I, all right, Mac,\" I said, somewhat huskily. What with seeing him again, his kindly face behind its glasses, the cheerful faith in me which was his contribution to our friendship,--even the way he shook his own hand in default of mine,--my throat tightened. Here, after all, was home and a friend. He looked up at the rail, and motioned to a rope that hung there. \"Get your stuff and come with us for breakfast,\" he said. \"You look as if you hadn't eaten since you left.\" \"I'm afraid I can't, Mac.\" \"They're not going to hold you, are they?\" \"For a day or so, yes.\" Mac's reply to this was a violent resume of the ancestry and present lost condition of the Philadelphia police, ending with a request that I jump over, and let them go to the place he had just designated as their abiding-place in eternity.

I'd like to know you.'\" \"Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garbed female?\" \"Don't be silly. You tread on her foot, or pick up her handkerchief, or something like that.

But suppose we try the unorthodox. Tommy, let's be adventurers!\" \"Certainly,\" replied Tommy cheerfully. \"How do we begin?\" \"That's the difficulty. If we could make ourselves known, people might hire us to commit crimes for them.\" \"Delightful,\" commented Tommy. \"Especially coming from a clergyman's daughter!\" \"The moral guilt,\" Tuppence pointed out, \"would be theirs--not mine.

This has been too much for you.\" Liddy helped me back to bed, and under the impression that I was in danger of freezing to death, put a hot-water bottle over my heart and another at my feet. Then she left me. It was early dawn now, and from voices under my window I surmised that Mr. Jarvis and his companions were searching the grounds. As for me, I lay in bed, with every faculty awake. Where had Halsey gone? How had he gone, and when? Before the murder, no doubt, but who would believe that? If either he or Jack Bailey had heard an intruder in the house and shot him--as they might have been justified in doing--why had they run away? The whole thing was unheard of, outrageous, and--impossible to ignore. About six o'clock Gertrude came in. She was fully dressed, and I sat up nervously. \"Poor Aunty!\" she said. \"What a shocking night you have had!\" She came over and sat down on the bed, and I saw she looked very tired and worn. \"Is there anything new?\" I asked anxiously. \"Nothing. The car is gone, but Warner\"--he is the chauffeur--\"Warner is at the lodge and knows nothing about it.\" \"Well,\" I said, \"if I ever get my hands on Halsey Innes, I shall not let go until I have told him a few things. When we get this cleared up, I am going back to the city to be quiet. One more night like the last two will end me. The peace of the country--fiddle sticks!\" Whereupon I told Gertrude of the noises the night before, and the figure on the veranda in the east wing.

His pulse was slow and rather faint, his hands cold. \"Is there anything I can do for you?\" \"Yes,\" he snarled. \"You can get me a belaying-pin and let me at those fools over there. Turner did this, and you know it as well as I do!\" I slid his revolver into my pocket, and went back to the men. Counting Williams and the cook and myself, there were nine of us. The cook I counted out, ordering him to go to the galley and prepare breakfast. The eight that were left I divided into two watches, Burns taking one and I the other. On Burns's watch were Clarke, McNamara, and Williams; on mine, Oleson, Adams, and Charlie Jones. It was two bells, or five o'clock. Burns struck the gong sharply as an indication that order, of a sort, had been restored. The rising sun was gleaming on the sails; the gray surface of the sea was ruffling under the morning breeze. From the galley a thin stream of smoke was rising. Some of the horror of the night went with the darkness, but the thought of what waited in the cabin below was on us all. I suggested another attempt to rouse Mr. Turner, and Burns and Clarke went below. They came back in ten minutes, reporting no change in Turner's condition. There was open grumbling among the men at the situation, but we were helpless. Burns and I decided to go on as if Turner were not on board, until he was in condition to take hold. We thought it best to bring up the bodies while all the crew was on duty, and then to"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "At a gate in the fence beyond the warehouse Hunter stopped. It was an ordinary wooden gate and it opened with a thumb latch. Beyond stretched a long, narrow, brick-paved alleyway, perhaps three feet wide, and lighted by the merest glimmer of a light ahead. Hunter went on regardless of puddles in the brick paving, and I stumbled after him. As we advanced, I could see that the light was a single electric bulb, hung over a second gate. While Hunter fumbled for a key in his pocket, I had time to see that this gate had a Yale lock, was provided, at the side, with an electric bell button, and had a letter slot cut in it. Hunter opened the gate and preceded me through it. The gate swung to and clicked behind me. After the gloom of the passageway, the small brick-paved yard seemed brilliant with lights. Two wires were strung its length, dotted with many electric lamps. In a corner a striped tent stood out in grotesque relief; it seemed to be empty, and the weather was an easy explanation. From the two-story house beyond there came suddenly a burst of piano music and a none too steady masculine voice. Hunter turned to me, with his foot on the wooden steps. \"Above everything else,\" he warned, \"keep your temper. Nobody gives a hang in here whether you're the mayor of the town, the champion pool-player of the first ward, or the roundsman on the beat.\" The door at the top of the steps was also Yale-locked. We stepped at once into the kitchen, from which I imagined that the house faced on another street, and that for obvious reasons only its rear entrance was used. The kitchen was bright and clean; it was littered, however, with half-cut loaves of bread, glasses and empty bottles.

This is John Harold Eardsley.\" With his last words Colonel Race had swung away and left us. I stood staring after him. Harry's voice recalled me to myself. \"Anne, forgive me, say you forgive me.\" He took my hand in his and almost mechanically I drew it away. \"Why did you deceive me?\" \"I don't know that I can make you understand. I was afraid of all that sort of thing—the power and fascination of wealth. I wanted you to care for me just for myself—for the man I was—without ornaments and trappings.\" \"You mean you didn't trust me?\" \"You can put it that way if you like, but it isn't quite true. I'd become embittered, suspicious—always prone to look for ulterior motives—and it was so wonderful to be cared for in the way you cared for me.\" \"I see,\" I said slowly. I was going over in my own mind the story he had told me. For the first time I noted discrepancies in it which I had disregarded—an assurance of money, the power to buy back the diamonds of Nadina, the way in which he had preferred to speak of both men from the point of view of an outsider. And when he had said \"my friend\" he had meant, not Eardsley, but Lucas. It was Lucas, the quiet fellow, who had loved Nadina so deeply. \"How did it come about?\" I asked. \"We were both reckless—anxious to get killed. One night we exchanged identification discs—for luck! Lucas was killed the next day—blown to pieces.\" I shuddered. \"But why didn't you tell me now? This morning? You couldn't have doubted my caring for you by this time?\" \"Anne, I didn't want to spoil it all. I wanted to take you back to the island. What's the good of money? It can't buy happiness.

Once I heard her give a startled exclamation, and both Jones and I leaped to the door. But the next moment she was talking again quietly. Ten minutes--fifteen--passed. I grew restless and took to wandering about the cabin. Mrs. Johns came to the door opposite, and asked to have tea sent down to the stewardess. I called the request up the companionway, unwilling to leave the cabin for a moment. When I came back, Jones was standing at the door of Vail's cabin, looking in. His face was pale. \"Look there!\" he said hoarsely. \"Look at the bell. He must have tried to push the button!\" I stared in. Williams had put the cabin to rights, as nearly as he could. The soaked mattress was gone, and a clean linen sheet was spread over the bunk. Poor Vail's clothing, as he had taken it off the night before, hung on a mahogany stand beside the bed, and above, almost concealed by his coat, was the bell. Jones's eyes were fixed on the darkish smear, over and around the bell, on the white paint. I measured the height of the bell from the bed. It was well above, and to one side--a smear rather than a print, too indeterminate to be of any value, sinister, cruel. \"He didn't do that, Charlie,\" I said. \"He couldn't have got up to it after--That is the murderer's mark. He leaned there, one hand against the wall, to look down at his work. And, without knowing it, he pressed the button that roused the two women.\" He had not heard the story of Henrietta Sloane, and, as we waited, I told him. Some of the tension was relaxing. He tried, in his argumentative German way, to drag me into a discussion as to the foreordination of a death that resulted from an accidental ringing of a bell. But my ears were alert for the voices near by, and soon Miss Lee opened the door.

Get somebody here, you drunken fool!\" He rose and staggered up the companionway, and I ran to Miss Lee's door. It was closed and locked, as were all the others except Vail's and the one I had broken open. I reached Mr. Turner's door last. It was locked, and I got no response to my knock. I remembered that his room and Vail's connected through a bath, and, still holding my revolver leveled, I ran into Vail's room again, this time turning on the light. A night light was burning in the bath-room, and the door beyond was unlocked. I flung it open and stepped in. Turner was lying on his bed, fully dressed, and at first I thought he too had been murdered. But he was in a drunken stupor. He sat up, dazed, when I shook him by the arm. \"Mr. Turner!\" I cried. \"Try to rouse yourself, man! The captain has been murdered, and Mr. Vail!\" He made an effort to sit up, swayed, and fell back again. His face was swollen and purplish, his eyes congested. He made an effort to speak, but failed to be intelligible. I had no time to waste. Somewhere on the Ella the murderer was loose. He must be found. I flung out of Turner's cabin as the crew, gathered from the forecastle and from the decks, crowded down the forward companionway. I ran my eye over them. Every man was there, Singleton below by the captain's body, the crew, silent and horror-struck, grouped on the steps: Clarke, McNamara, Burns, Oleson, and Adams. Behind the crew, Charlie Jones had left the wheel and stood peering down, until sharply ordered back. Williams, with a bandage on his head, and Tom, the mulatto cook, were in the group. I stood, revolver in hand, staring at the men. Among them, I felt sure, was the murderer. But which one? All were equally pale, equally terrified. \"Boys,\" I said, \"Mr. Vail and your captain have been murdered. The"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "She was quite conscious, but very weak. She told the story to Fred and myself, and in a corner Burton took it down in shorthand. We got her to sign it about daylight sometime, and she died very quietly shortly after Edith arrived at eight. To give her story as she gave it would be impossible; the ramblings of a sick mind, the terrible pathos of it all, is impossible to repeat. She lay there, her long, thin body practically dead, fighting the death rattle in her throat. There were pauses when for five minutes she would lie in a stupor, only to rouse and go forward from the very word where she had stopped. She began with her married life, and to understand the beauty of it is to understand the things that came after. She was perfectly, ideally, illogically happy. Then one day Henry Butler accepted the nomination for state treasurer, and with that things changed. During his term in office he altered greatly; his wife could only guess that things were wrong, for he refused to talk. The crash came, after all, with terrible suddenness. There had been an all-night conference at the Butler home, and Mr. Butler, in a frenzy at finding himself a dupe, had called the butler from bed and forcibly ejected Fleming and Schwartz from the house. Ellen Butler had been horrified, sickened by what she regarded as the vulgarity of the occurrence. But her loyalty to her husband never wavered. Butler was one honest man against a complete organization of unscrupulous ones. His disgrace, imprisonment and suicide at the White Cat had followed in rapid succession. With his death, all that was worth while in his wife died. Her health was destroyed; she became one of the wretched army of neurasthenics, with only one idea: to retaliate, to pay back in measure full and running over, her wrecked life, her dead husband, her grief and her shame. She laid her plans with the caution and absolute recklessness of a diseased mentality.

On the way Mr. Holcombe questioned me closely about the events of the morning, and I recalled the incident of the burned pillow-slip. He made a note of it at once, and grew very thoughtful. He left me, however, at the police station. \"I'd rather not appear in this, Mrs. Pitman,\" he said apologetically, \"and I think better along my own lines. Not that I have anything against the police; they've done some splendid work. But this case takes imagination, and the police department deals with facts. We have no facts yet. What we need, of course, is to have the man detained until we are sure of our case.\" He lifted his hat and turned away, and I went slowly up the steps to the police station. Living, as I had, in a neighborhood where the police, like the poor, are always with us, and where the visits of the patrol wagon are one of those familiar sights that no amount of repetition enabled any of us to treat with contempt, I was uncomfortable until I remembered that my grandfather had been one of the first mayors of the city, and that, if the patrol had been at my house more than once, the entire neighborhood would testify that my boarders were usually orderly. At the door some one touched me on the arm. It was Mr. Holcombe again. \"I have been thinking it over,\" he said, \"and I believe you'd better not mention the piece of paper that you found behind the wash-stand. They might say the whole thing is a hoax.\" \"Very well,\" I agreed, and went in. The police sergeant in charge knew me at once, having stopped at my house more than once in flood-time for a cup of hot coffee. \"Sit down, Mrs. Pitman,\" he said. \"I suppose you are still making the best coffee and doughnuts in the city of Allegheny?

But they refused. Mr. Howell said he had promised to meet a lady, and to bring her through the flooded district in a boat. He shook hands with me, and smiled at Mr. Holcombe. \"You will have to restrain his enthusiasm, Mrs. Pitman,\" he said. \"He is a bloodhound on the scent. If his baying gets on your nerves, just send for me.\" He went down the stairs and stepped into the boat. \"Remember, Holcombe,\" he called, \"every well-constituted murder has two things: a motive and a corpse. You haven't either, only a mass of piffling details--\"  \"If everybody waited until he saw flames, instead of relying on the testimony of the smoke,\" Mr. Holcombe snapped, \"what would the fire loss be?\" Mr. Howell poled his boat to the front door, and sitting down, prepared to row out. \"You are warned, Mrs. Pitman,\" he called to me. \"If he doesn't find a body to fit the clues, he's quite capable of making one to fill the demand.\" \"Horn--\" said Mr. Holcombe, looking at the slip again. \"The tail of the 'n' is torn off--evidently only part of a word.

It was the same dagger I had seen reposing in the glass jar the preceding morning! \"I'm expecting the doctor any minute,\" explained Giraud. \"Although we hardly need him. There's no doubt what the man died of. He was stabbed to the heart, and death must have been pretty well instantaneous.\" \"When was it done? Last night?\" Giraud shook his head. \"Hardly. I don't lay down the law on medical evidence, but the man's been dead well over twelve hours. When do you say you last saw that dagger?\" \"About ten o'clock yesterday morning.\" \"Then I should be inclined to fix the crime as being done not long after that.\" \"But people were passing and repassing this shed continually.\" Giraud laughed disagreeably. \"You progress to a marvel! Who told you he was killed in this shed?\" \"Well I felt flustered. \"I—I assumed it.\" \"Oh, what a fine detective!

Never, to this day, have I been able to rid myself of a sneaking fondness for Sir Eustace. I dare say it's reprehensible, but there it is. I admired him. He was a thorough-going villain, I dare say—but he was a pleasant one. I've never met any one half so amusing since. I concealed my feelings, of course. Naturally Colonel Race would feel quite differently about it. He wanted Sir Eustace brought to justice. There was nothing very surprising in his escape when one came to think of it. All round Jo'burg he must have innumerable spies and agents. And, whatever Colonel Race might think, I was exceedingly doubtful that they would ever catch him. He probably had a well-planned line of retreat. Indeed, he had said as much to us. I expressed myself suitably, though in a rather lukewarm manner, and the conversation languished. Then Colonel Race asked suddenly for Harry. I told him that he had gone off at dawn and that I hadn't seen him this morning. \"You understand, don't you, Anne, that apart from formalities, he is completely cleared? There are technicalities, of course, but Sir Eustace's guilt is well assured. There is nothing now to keep you apart.\" He said this without looking at me, in a slow, jerky voice. \"I understand,\" I said gratefully. \"And there is no"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "\"I haven't got any ready money.\" Papa looked thoroughly exasperated. \"My child, I really cannot be bothered with these vulgar money details.

Write to my publishers.\" I acquiesced doubtfully, Papa's books bringing in more glory than money. I liked the idea of going to Rhodesia immensely. \"Stern silent men,\" I murmured to myself in an ecstasy. Then something in my parent's appearance struck me as unusual. \"You have odd boots on, papa,\" I said. \"Take off the brown one and put on the other black one. And don't forget your muffler. It's a very cold day.\" In a few minutes Papa stalked off, correctly booted and well mufflered. He returned late that evening, and, to my dismay, I saw his muffler and overcoat were missing. \"Dear me, Anne, you are quite right. I took them off to go into the cavern. One gets so dirty there.\" I nodded feelingly, remembering an occasion when Papa had returned literally plastered from head to foot with rich Pleiocene clay. Our principal reason for settling in Little Hampsly had been the neighbourhood of Hampsly Cavern, a buried cave rich in deposits of the Aurignacian culture. We had a tiny Museum in the village, and the curator and Papa spent most of their days messing about underground and bringing to light portions of woolly rhinoceros and cave bear. Papa coughed badly all the evening, and the following morning I saw he had a temperature and sent for the doctor. Poor Papa, he never had a chance. It was double pneumonia. He died four days later. Every one was very kind to me. Dazed as I was, I appreciated that. I felt no overwhelming grief. Papa had never loved me, I knew that well enough. If he had, I might have loved him in return.

Elsa Lee knelt beside her and slid a pillow under her head. \"Call the maids, Leslie,\" she said quietly. \"Karen has something for this sort of thing. Tell her to bring it quickly.\" I went the length of the cabin and into the chartroom. The maids' room was here, on the port-side, and thus aft of Mrs. Turner's and Miss Lee's rooms. It had one door only, and two small barred windows, one above each of the two bunks. I turned on the chart-room lights. At the top of the after companionway the crew had been assembled, and Burns was haranguing them. I knocked at the maids' door, and, finding it unlocked, opened it an inch or so. \"Karen!\" I called--and, receiving no answer: \"Mrs. Sloane!\" (the stewardess). I opened the door wide and glanced in. Karen Hansen, the maid, was on the floor, dead. The stewardess, in collapse from terror, was in her bunk, uninjured. I went to the after companionway and called up to the men to send the first mate down; but Burns came instead. \"Singleton's sick,\" he explained. \"He's up there in a corner, with Oleson and McNamara holding him.\" \"Burns,\" I said cautiously--\"I've found another!\" \"God, not one of the women!\" \"One of the maids--Karen.\" Burns was a young fellow about my own age, and to this point he had stood up well. But he had been having a sort of flirtation with the girl, and I saw him go sick with horror. He wanted to see her, when he had got command of himself; but I would not let him enter the room.

It occurred to me that, after all, it would only be decent feeling on my part to inquire after the girl. And it would save trouble in the end. The matter would then be finished with. There would be no need for me to trouble about her any further. But, if I did not go at all, she might quite possibly come and look me up at the Villa. And that would be annoying in every way. Decidedly it would be better to pay a short call, in the course of which I could make it quite clear that I could do nothing further for her in my capacity of showman. Accordingly I left the beach, and walked inland. I soon found the Hôtel du Phare, a very unpretentious building. It was annoying in the extreme not to know the lady's name and, to save my dignity, I decided to stroll inside and look around. Probably I should find her in the lounge. Merlinville was a small place, you left your hotel to go to the beach, and you left the beach to return to the hotel. There were no other attractions. There was a Casino being built, but it was not yet completed. I had walked the length of the beach without seeing her, therefore she must be in the hotel. I went in. Several people were sitting in the tiny lounge, but my quarry was not amongst them. I looked into some other rooms, but there was no sign of her.

A young English lady, small and dark.

At that minute, Colonel Race stepped in through the window and came and joined us. \"What is Sir Eustace doing?\" asked Suzanne. \"I haven't seen him about to-day.\" Rather an odd expression passed over the Colonel's face. \"He's got a little trouble of his own to attend to which is keeping him busy.\" \"Tell us about it.\" \"I mustn't tell tales out of school.\" \"Tell us something—even if you have to invent it for our special benefit.\" \"Well, what would you say to the famous ‘Man in the Brown Suit' having made the voyage with us?\" _\"What? \"_ I felt the colour die out of my face and then surge back again.

Finding that photograph in the drawer, after that story of how it had been got from him by Inspector Brown, made me suspect Julius. Then I remembered that it was Sir James who had discovered the false Jane Finn. In the end, I couldn't make up my mind--and just decided to take no chances either way. I left a note for Julius, in case he was Mr. Brown, saying I was off to the Argentine, and I dropped Sir James's letter with the offer of the job by the desk so that he would see it was a genuine stunt. Then I wrote my letter to Mr. Carter and rang up Sir James. Taking him into my confidence would be the best thing either way, so I told him everything except where I believed the papers to be hidden. The way he helped me to get on the track of Tuppence and Annette almost disarmed me, but not quite. I kept my mind open between the two of them. And then I got a bogus note from Tuppence--and I knew!\" \"But how?\" Tommy took the note in question from his pocket and passed it round the table. \"It's her handwriting all right, but I knew it wasn't from her because of the signature. She'd never spell her name ‘Twopence,' but anyone who'd never seen it written might quite easily do so.

And I believe he contrived, finally, a clever enough bit of foolery. He was anxious to talk, and complained bitterly of loneliness, using every excuse to hold Tom, the cook, when he carried him his meals. He had asked for a Bible, too, and read it now and then. The morning of Burns's injury, I visited Singleton. The new outrage, coming at a time when they were slowly recovering confidence, had turned the men surly. The loss of the axe, the handle of which I had told them would, under skillful eyes, reveal the murderer as accurately as a photograph, was a serious blow. Again arose the specter of the innocent suffering for the guilty. They went doggedly about their work, and wherever they gathered there was muttered talk of the white figure. There was grumbling, too, over their lack of weapons for defense. The cook was a ringleader of the malcontents. Certain utensils were allowed him; but he was compelled at night to lock them in the galley, after either Burns's inspection or mine, and to turn over the key to one of us. On the morning after the attack, therefore, Tom, carrying Singleton's breakfast to him, told him at length what had occurred in the night, and dilated on his lack of self-defense should an attack be directed toward him. Singleton promptly offered to make him, out of wire, a key to the galley door, so that he could get what he wanted from it. The cook was to take an impression of the lock. In exchange, Tom was to fetch him, from a hiding place which Singleton designated in the forward house, a bottle of whiskey. The cook was a shrewd mulatto, and he let Singleton make the key. It was after ten that morning when he brought it to me. I was trying to get the details of his injury from Burns, at the time, in the tent. \"I didn't see or hear anything, Leslie,\" Burns said"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "I sat down on a chair. \"I can only conclude that you are a dangerous lunatic,\" I said coldly. \"Indeed?\" \"I should like to point out to you that my friends are perfectly well aware where I have gone, and that if I have not returned by this evening, they will come in search of me.

He was a well-known man, and his name might carry weight. But if they were in touch with Pagett, they might know I was lying. Better not risk Sir Eustace. \"Mrs. Blair, for one,\" I said lightly. \"A friend of mine with whom I am staying.\" \"I think not,\" said my captor, slyly shaking his orange head. \"You have not seen her since eleven this morning. And you received our note, bidding you come here, at lunch-time.\" His words showed me how closely my movements had been followed, but I was not going to give in without a fight. \"You are very clever,\" I said. \"Perhaps you have heard of that useful invention, the telephone? Mrs. Blair called me up on it when I was resting in my room after lunch. I told her then where I was going this afternoon.\" To my great satisfaction, I saw a shade of uneasiness pass over his face. Clearly he had overlooked the possibility that Suzanne might have telephoned to me.

In a second or two I realized that they came, not from the garden I was in, but from the adjoining garden of the Villa Marguerite, and that they were approaching rapidly. A girl's voice was speaking, a voice that I recognized as that of the beautiful Marthe. \"_Chéri___,\" she was saying, \"is it really true? Are all our troubles over.\" \"You know it, Marthe,\" Jack Renauld replied. \"Nothing can part us now, beloved. The last obstacle to our union is removed. Nothing can take you from me.\" \"Nothing?\" the girl murmured. \"Oh, Jack, Jack—I am afraid.\" I had moved to depart, realizing that I was quite unintentionally eavesdropping. As I rose to my feet, I caught sight of them through a gap in the hedge. They stood together facing me, the man's arm round the girl, his eyes looking into hers. They were a splendid looking couple, the dark, well-knit boy, and the fair young goddess. They seemed made for each other as they stood there, happy in spite of the terrible tragedy that overshadowed their young lives. But the girl's face was troubled, and Jack Renauld seemed to recognize it, as he held her closer to him and asked: \"But what are you afraid of, darling? What is there to fear—now?\" And then I saw the look in her eyes, the look Poirot had spoken of, as she murmured, so that I almost guessed at the words. \"I am afraid—for _you___. ...\" I did not hear young Renauld's answer, for my attention was distracted by an unusual appearance a little further down the hedge.

She had noticed the speaker more than once amongst the first-class passengers. There had been a hint of mystery about him which had appealed to her imagination. He spoke to no one. If anyone spoke to him he was quick to rebuff the overture. Also he had a nervous way of looking over his shoulder with a swift, suspicious glance. She noticed now that he was greatly agitated. There were beads of perspiration on his brow. He was evidently in a state of overmastering fear. And yet he did not strike her as the kind of man who would be afraid to meet death! \"Yes?\" Her grave eyes met his inquiringly. He stood looking at her with a kind of desperate irresolution. \"It must be!\" he muttered to himself. \"Yes--it is the only way.\" Then aloud he said abruptly: \"You are an American?\" \"Yes.\" \"A patriotic one?\" The girl flushed. \"I guess you've no right to ask such a thing!

What is it?\" \"Next time you happen to be alone with Lawrence Cavendish, I want you to say this to him. ‘I have a message for you, from Poirot. He says: \"Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace!\"' Nothing more. Nothing less.\" \"‘Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.' Is that right?\" I asked, much mystified. \"Excellent.\" \"But what does it mean?\" \"Ah, that I will leave you to find out. You have access to the facts. Just say that to him, and see what he says.\" \"Very well—but it's all extremely mysterious.\" We were running into Tadminster now, and Poirot directed the car to the \"Analytical Chemist.\" Poirot hopped down briskly, and went inside. In a few minutes he was back again. \"There,\" he said. \"That is all my business.\" \"What were you doing there?\" I asked, in lively curiosity. \"I left something to be analysed.\" \"Yes, but what?\" \"The sample of cocoa I took from the saucepan in the bedroom.\" \"But that has already been tested!\" I cried, stupefied. \"Dr. Bauerstein had it tested, and you yourself laughed at the possibility of there being strychnine in it.\" \"I know Dr. Bauerstein had it tested,\" replied Poirot quietly. \"Well, then?\" \"Well, I have a fancy for having it analysed again, that is all.\" And not another word on the subject could I drag out of him. This proceeding of Poirot's, in respect of the cocoa, puzzled me intensely. I could see neither rhyme nor reason in it. However, my confidence in him, which at one time had rather waned, was fully restored since his belief"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "There was a murmur at that. \"Mr. Singleton, I suggest that these men stay together in a body, and that no one be allowed to go below until all have been searched and all weapons taken from them.\" Singleton had dropped into a chair, and sat with his face buried in his hands, his back to the captain's body. He looked up without moving, and his face was gray. \"All right,\" he said. \"Do as you like. I'm sick.\" He looked sick. Burns, who had taken Schwartz's place as second mate, left the group and came toward me. \"We'd better waken the women,\" he said. \"If you'll tell them, Leslie, I'll take the crew on deck and keep them there.\" Singleton seemed dazed, and when Burns spoke of taking the men on deck, he got up dizzily. \"I'm going too,\" he muttered. \"I'll go crazy if I stay down here with that.\" The rug had been drawn back to show the crew what had happened. I drew it reverently over the body again. After the men had gone, I knocked at Mrs. Turner's door. It was some time before she roused; when she answered, her voice was startled. \"What is it?\" \"It's Leslie, Mrs. Turner. Will you come to the door?\" \"In a moment.\" She threw on a dressing-gown, and opened the door. \"What is wrong?\" I told her, as gently as I could. I thought she would faint; but she pulled herself together and looked past me into the cabin. \"That is--?\" \"The captain, Mrs. Turner.\" \"And Mr. Vail?\" \"In his cabin.\" \"Where is Mr. Turner?\" \"In his cabin, asleep.\" She looked at me strangely, and, leaving the door, went into her sister's room, next. I heard Miss Lee's low cry of horror, and almost immediately the two women came to the doorway. \"Have you seen Mr. Turner?\" Miss Lee demanded. \"Just now.\" \"Has Mrs. Johns been told?\" \"Not yet.\" She went herself to Mrs. Johns's cabin, and knocked. She got an immediate answer, and Mrs. Johns, partly dressed, opened the door. \"What's the matter?\" she demanded. \"The whole"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "Briefly, going home from the theater in New York the night before, he had bought an \"extra\" which had contained a brief account of the Ella's return. He seems to have gone into a frenzy of excitement at once. He borrowed a small car,--one scornfully designated as a \"road louse,\"--and assembled in it, in wild confusion, one suit of clothes for me, his own and much too small, one hypodermic case, an armful of newspapers with red scare-heads, a bottle of brandy, a bottle of digitalis, one police card, and one excited young lawyer, of the same vintage in law that Mac and I were in medicine. At the last moment, fearful that the police might not know who I was, he had flung in a scrapbook in which he had pasted--with a glue that was to make his fortune--records of my exploits on the football field! A dozen miles from Philadelphia the little machine had turned over on a curve, knocking all the law and most of the enthusiasm out of Walters, the legal gentleman, and smashing the brandy-bottle. McWhirter had picked himself up, kicked viciously at the car, and, gathering up his impedimenta, had made the rest of the journey by foot and street-car. His wrath at finding me a prisoner was unbounded; his scorn at Walters, the attorney, for not confounding the police with law enough to free me, was furious and contemptuous. He picked up the oars in sullen silence, and, leaning on them, called a loud and defiant farewell for the benefit of the officer. \"All right,\" he said. \"An hour or so won't make much difference. But you'll be free today, all right, all right. And don't let them bluff you, boy. If the police get funny, tackle them and throw 'em overboard, one by one. You can do it.\" He made an insulting gesture at the police, picked up his oars, and rowed away into the mist. But I was not free, that day, nor for many days. As I had expected, Turner, his family, Mrs. Johns, and the stewardess were released, after"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "\"Indeed? And from whom did you get all this interesting information? From the man who is even now being looked for by the police? His evidence will be very valuable.\" \"We have other evidence. There is some one else who knew that Nadina was going to meet you at the Mill House.\" Sir Eustace looked surprised. Colonel Race made a gesture with his hand. Arthur Minks _alias_ the Rev. Edward Chichester _alias_ Miss Pettigrew stepped forward. He was pale and nervous, but he spoke clearly enough: \"I saw Nadina in Paris the night before she went over to England. I was posing at the time as a Russian Count. She told me of her purpose. I warned her, knowing what kind of man she had to deal with, but she did not take my advice. There was a wireless message on the table. I read it. Afterwards I thought I would have a try for the diamonds myself. In Johannesburg, Mr. Rayburn accosted me. He persuaded me to come over to his side.\" Sir Eustace looked at him. He said nothing, but Minks seemed visibly to wilt. \"Rats always leaving a sinking ship,\" observed Sir Eustace. \"I don't care for rats. Sooner or later, I destroy vermin.\" \"There's just one thing I'd like to tell you, Sir Eustace,\" I remarked. \"That tin you threw out of the window didn't contain the diamonds. It had common pebbles in it. The diamonds are in a perfectly safe place. As a matter of fact, they're in the big giraffe's stomach. Suzanne hollowed it out, put the diamonds in with cotton wool, so that they wouldn't rattle, and plugged it up again.\" Sir Eustace looked at me for some time. His reply was characteristic: \"I always did hate that blinking giraffe,\" he said. \"It must have been instinct.\" We were not able to return to Johannesburg that night. The shells were coming over pretty fast, and I gathered that we were now more or less cut off, owing to the rebels having obtained possession of a new part of the suburbs. Our place of"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "Glaring headlines, sandwiched biographies of every member of the household, subtle innuendoes, the usual familiar tag about the police having a clue. Nothing was spared us. It was a slack time. The war was momentarily inactive, and the newspapers seized with avidity on this crime in fashionable life: \"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\" was the topic of the moment. Naturally it was very annoying for the Cavendishes. The house was constantly besieged by reporters, who were consistently denied admission, but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds, where they lay in wait with cameras, for any unwary members of the household. We all lived in a blast of publicity. The Scotland Yard men came and went, examining, questioning, lynx-eyed and reserved of tongue. Towards what end they were working, we did not know. Had they any clue, or would the whole thing remain in the category of undiscovered crimes? After breakfast, Dorcas came up to me rather mysteriously, and asked if she might have a few words with me. \"Certainly. What is it, Dorcas?\" \"Well, it's just this, sir. You'll be seeing the Belgian gentleman to-day perhaps?\" I nodded. \"Well, sir, you know how he asked me so particular if the mistress, or anyone else, had a green dress?\" \"Yes, yes. You have found one?\" My interest was aroused. \"No, not that, sir. But since then I've remembered what the young gentlemen\"—John and Lawrence were still the \"young gentlemen\" to Dorcas call the ‘dressing-up box.' It's up in the front attic, sir. A great chest, full of old clothes and fancy dresses, and what not. And it came to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst them. So, if you'd tell the Belgian gentleman— \"I will tell him, Dorcas,\" I promised. \"Thank you very much, sir. A very nice gentleman he is, sir. And quite a different class from them two detectives from London, what goes prying about, and asking questions. I don't hold with foreigners as a rule, but from what the newspapers say I make out as how these brave Belges isn't"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "I was pleased with the compliment. There had been times when I hardly thought that Poirot appreciated me at my true worth. \"Yes,\" he continued, staring at me thoughtfully, \"you will be invaluable.\" This was naturally gratifying, but Poirot's next words were not so welcome. \"I must have an ally in the house,\" he observed reflectively. \"You have me,\" I protested. \"True, but you are not sufficient.\" I was hurt, and showed it. Poirot hurried to explain himself. \"You do not quite take my meaning. You are known to be working with me. I want somebody who is not associated with us in any way.\" \"Oh, I see. How about John?\" \"No, I think not.\" \"The dear fellow isn't perhaps very bright,\" I said thoughtfully. \"Here comes Miss Howard,\" said Poirot suddenly. \"She is the very person. But I am in her black books, since I cleared Mr. Inglethorp. Still, we can but try.\" With a nod that was barely civil, Miss Howard assented to Poirot's request for a few minutes' conversation. We went into the little morning-room, and Poirot closed the door. \"Well, Monsieur Poirot,\" said Miss Howard impatiently, \"what is it? Out with it. I'm busy.\" \"Do you remember, mademoiselle, that I once asked you to help me?\" \"Yes, I do.\" The lady nodded. \"And I told you I'd help you with pleasure—to hang Alfred Inglethorp.\" \"Ah!\" Poirot studied her seriously. \"Miss Howard, I will ask you one question. I beg of you to reply to it truthfully.\" \"Never tell lies,\" replied Miss Howard. \"It is this. Do you still believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by her husband?\" \"What do you mean?\" she asked sharply. \"You needn't think your pretty explanations influence me in the slightest. I'll admit that it wasn't he who bought strychnine at the chemist's shop. What of that? I dare say he soaked fly paper, as I told you at the beginning.\" \"That is arsenic—not strychnine,\" said Poirot mildly. \"What does that matter? Arsenic would put poor Emily out of the way just as well as strychnine. If I'm convinced he did it,"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "\"I am acquainted with the details because--well, it was I who found her dead.\" \"Indeed,\" said the doctor, starting. \"Yes,\" said Sir James, and stroked his chin reflectively. \"This is very sad news, but you will excuse me if I say that I do not see how it bears on the subject of your inquiry?\" \"It bears on it in this way, is it not a fact that Mrs. Vandemeyer committed a young relative of hers to your charge?\" Julius leaned forward eagerly. \"That is the case,\" said the doctor quietly. \"Under the name of----?\" \"Janet Vandemeyer. I understood her to be a niece of Mrs. Vandemeyer's.\" \"And she came to you?\" \"As far as I can remember in June or July of 1915.\" \"Was she a mental case?\" \"She is perfectly sane, if that is what you mean. I understood from Mrs. Vandemeyer that the girl had been with her on the _Lusitania_ when that ill-fated ship was sunk, and had suffered a severe shock in consequence.\" \"We're on the right track, I think?\" Sir James looked round. \"As I said before, I'm a mutt!\" returned Julius. The doctor looked at them all curiously. \"You spoke of wanting a statement from her,\" he said. \"Supposing she is not able to give one?\" \"What? You have just said that she is perfectly sane.\" \"So she is. Nevertheless, if you want a statement from her concerning any events prior to May 7, 1915, she will not be able to give it to you.\" They looked at the little man, stupefied. He nodded cheerfully. \"It's a pity,\" he said. \"A great pity, especially as I gather, Sir James, that the matter is important. But there it is, she can tell you nothing.\" \"But why, man? Darn it all, why?\" The little man shifted his benevolent glance to the excited young American. \"Because Janet Vandemeyer is suffering from a complete loss of memory.\" _\"What? \"_ \"Quite so. An interesting case, a _very_ interesting case. Not so uncommon, really, as you would think. There are several very well known parallels. It's the first case"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "\"Carter left for parts unknown last night, taking with him enough money to keep him in comfort for some little time.\" \"Until all this blows over,\" I said bitterly. \"The trip was for the benefit of his health. He has been suffering--and is still suffering, from a curious lapse of memory.\" Davidson smiled at me engagingly. \"He has entirely forgotten everything that occurred from the time he entered Mr. Fleming's employment, until that gentleman left home. I doubt if he will ever recover.\" With Carter gone, his retreat covered by the police, supplied with funds from some problematical source, further search for him was worse than useless. In fact, Davidson strongly intimated that it might be dangerous and would be certainly unpleasant. I yielded ungraciously and ordered the cab to take me home. But on the way I cursed my folly for not having followed this obvious clue earlier, and I wondered what this thing could be that Carter knew, that was at least surmised by various headquarters men, and yet was so carefully hidden from the world at large. The party newspapers had come out that day with a signed statement from Mr. Fleming's physician in Plattsburg that he had been in ill health and inclined to melancholia for some time. The air was thick with rumors of differences with his party: the dust cloud covered everything; pretty soon it would settle and hide the tracks of those who had hurried to cover under its protection. Davidson left me at a corner down-town. He turned to give me a parting admonition. \"There's an old axiom in the mills around here, 'never sit down on a piece of metal until you spit on it.' If it sizzles, don't sit.\" He grinned. \"Your best position just now, young man, is standing, with your hands over your head. Confidentially, there ain't anything within expectorating distance just now that ain't pretty well het up.\" He left me with that, and I did not see him again until the night at the White Cat, when he helped put me through the transom.

Harry was on the _stoep_ outside. \"Put some clothes on, Anne, and come out. I want to speak to you.\" I huddled on a few garments, and stepped out into the cool night air—still and scented, with its velvety feel. Harry beckoned me out of earshot of the house. His face looked pale and determined and his eyes were blazing. \"Anne, do you remember saying to me once that women enjoyed doing the things they disliked for the sake of some one they liked?\" \"Yes,\" I said, wondering what was coming. He caught me in his arms. \"Anne, come away with me—now—to-night. Back to Rhodesia—back to the island. I can't stand all this tomfoolery. I can't wait for you any longer.\" I disengaged myself a minute. \"And what about my French frocks?\" I lamented mockingly. To this day Harry never knows when I'm in earnest and when I'm only teasing him. \"Damn your French frocks. Do you think I want to put frocks on you? I'm a damned sight more likely to want to tear them off you. I'm not going to let you go, do you hear? You're my woman. If I let you go away, I may lose you. I'm never sure of you. You're coming with me now—to-night—and damn everybody.\" He held me to him, kissing me until I could hardly breathe. \"I can't do without you any longer, Anne. I can't indeed. I hate all this money. Let Race have it. Come on. Let's go.\" \"My toothbrush?\" I demurred. \"You can buy one. I know I'm a lunatic, but for God's sake, _come! \"_ He stalked off at a furious pace. I followed him as meekly as the Barotsi woman I had observed at the Falls. Only I wasn't carrying a frying-pan on my head. He walked so fast that it was very difficult to keep up with him. \"Harry,\" I said at last, in a meek voice, \"are we going to walk"}]
