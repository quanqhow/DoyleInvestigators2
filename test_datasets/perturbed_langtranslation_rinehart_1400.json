wardrop i interpose besides i think i have get to the bottom of that mystery margery look at me quickly but i shake my head it be too early to tell my suspicion the thing that look black against me be bad enough but they have nothing to do with miss jane i will have to go back to before the night she go away back to the time mr butler be the state treasurer and your father margery be his cashier butler be not a business man he let too much responsibility lie with his subordinate and then accord to the storey he couldn't do much anyhow against schwartz the cashier be entirely under machine

where she be she couldn't even speak her own tongue but surely all this be most unusual put in julius no my dear sir quite normal under the circumstance severe shock to the nervous system loss of memory proceed nearly always on the same line i suggest a specialist of course there's a very good man in paris make a study of these case but mr vandemeyer oppose the idea of publicity that might result from such a course i can imagine she would say sir jam grimly i fell in with her view there be a certain notoriety give to these case and the girl be very young nineteen i believe it seem a pity that her infirmity should be talk about might damage her prospect besides there be no special treatment to pursue in such case it be really a matter of wait wait yes sooner or later the memory will return a suddenly a it go but in all probability the girl will have entirely forget the intervene period and will take up life where she leave off at the sink of the _lusitania_ and when do you expect this to happen the doctor shrug his shoulder ah that i cannot say sometimes it be a matter of month sometimes it have be know to be a long a twenty year sometimes another shock do the trick one

to the boat and so on wouldn't that do the trick wouldn't it give a mighty big bump to her subconscious self or whatever the jargon be and start it function again right away a very interest speculation mr hersheimmer in my own opinion it would be successful it be unfortunate that there be no chance of the condition repeat themselves a you suggest not by nature perhaps doc but i'm talk about art art why yes what's the difficulty hire a liner a liner murmur dr hall faintly hire some passenger hire a submarine that's the only difficulty i guess government be apt to be a bite hide bind over their engine of war they won't sell to the first comer still i guess that can be get over ever hear of the word 'graft sir well graft get there every time i reckon that we shan't really need to fire a torpedo if every one hustle round and scream loud enough that the ship be sink it ought to be enough for an innocent young girl like jane by the time she's get a life belt on her and be be hustle into a boat with a well drill lot of artiste do the hysterical stunt on deck why she ought to be right back where she be in may how's that for the bare outline dr hall look at julius everything

to a really rich man very remarkable plan very remarkable he murmur the movie of course your american word for the kinema very interest i fear we be perhaps a little behind the time over here in our method and you really mean to carry out this remarkable plan of yours you bet your bottom dollar i do the doctor believe him which be a tribute to his nationality if an englishman have suggest such a thing he would have have grave doubt a to his sanity i cannot guarantee a cure he point out perhaps i ought to make that quite clear sure that's all right say julius you just trot out jane and leave the rest to me jane miss janet vandemeyer then can we get on the long distance to your place right away and ask them to send her up or shall i run down and fetch her in my car the doctor star i beg

leave all his property behind him and yet where could he be i call in the local police but without success rain have fall on the night before and we examine the lawn and the path all round the house

out of the ground the lake there be eight foot deep and you can imagine our feel when we saw that the trail of the poor demented girl come to an end at the edge of it 'of course we have the drag at once and set to work to recover the remain but no trace of the body could we find on the other hand we bring to the surface an object of a most unexpected kind it be a linen bag which contain within it a mass of old rust and discolor metal and several dull color piece of pebble or glass this strange find be all that we could get from the mere and although we make every possible search and inquiry

which be even more interest than the first it may be that the solution of the one may prove to be the solution of the other you will excuse me musgrave if i say that your butler appear to me to have be a very clever man and to have have a clearer insight than ten generation of his master 'i hardly follow you say musgrave 'the paper seem to me to be of no practical importance 'but to me it seem immensely practical and i fancy that brunton take the same view he have probably see it before that night on which you catch him 'it be very possible we take no pain to hide it 'he simply wish i should imagine to refresh his memory upon that last occasion he have a i understand some sort of map or chart which he be compare with the manuscript and which he thrust into his pocket when you

i have bolt the door that i discover the absence of any weapon everything that have go before have point to a position so untenable that suicide seem it natural and inevitable result with the discovery that there be no revolver on the table or floor the thing be more ominous i decide at once to call the young city physician in the room across the hall and with something approximate panic i throw open the door to face harry wardrop and behind him hunter i do not remember that any one speak hunter jump past me into the room and take in in a single glance what i have labour to acquire in three minute a wardrop come in hunter lock the door behind him and we three stand star at the prostrate figure over the table i watch wardrop i have never see so suddenly abject a picture he drop into a chair and feel for his handkerchief wipe his shake lip every particle of colour leave his face and he be limp unnerve do you hear the shoot hunter ask me it have be a matter of minute since it

the revolver from him he be like a crazy man and a soon a i dare to leave him i go out to try and find a doctor to get some cocaine yes not because he be already wound and you be afraid it be fatal wardrop shudder then he pull himself together and his tone be more natural what's the use of lie about it he say wearily you won't believe me if i tell the truth either but he be dead when i get here i hear something like the bang of a door a i go up stair but the noise be terrific down below and i couldn't tell when i go in he be just drop forward and he hesitate the revolver hunter query lynx eye be in his hand he be dead then where be the revolver i will turn it over to the coroner you will give it to me hunter reply sharply and after a little fumble wardrop produce it from his hip pocket it be an ordinary thirty eight the detective open it and glance at it two chamber be empty and you wait say ten minute before you call for help and even then you go outside hunt a doctor what be you do in those ten minute wardrop shut his lip and refuse to reply if mr fleming shoot himself the detective pursue relentlessly there would be powder mark around the wind then too he be in the act of

ask any question and i let him go into the death chamber unprepared the presence of death apparently have no effect on him but the identity of the dead man almost stupefy him fleming he say awe a he look down at the body fleming by all that's sacred and a suicide hunter watch him grimly how long have he be dead he ask the doctor glance at the bullet wind in the forehead and from there

look very serious over it how do you explain it i just don't attempt to explain it it seem the very maddest queerest thing that ever happen to me the queerest perhaps say holmes thoughtfully what do you make of it yourself well i don't profess to understand it yet this case of yours be very complex sir henry when take in conjunction with your uncle's death i be not sure that of all the five hundred case of capital importance which i have handle there be one which cut so deep but we hold several thread in our hand and the odds be that one or other of them guide u to the truth we may waste

in the direction of cape town i must know if chichester be on the boat whether to sail on her myself or not i could not determine but in the end i decide to do so chichester would not know that i have see him in the villa at muizenberg he would doubtless lay further trap for me but i be forewarn and he be the man i be after the man who be seek the diamond on behalf of the mysterious colonel ala for

go a long way suzanne seem unconvinced an hour or two of gag and bind would have change her view quickly enough suzanne like thrill but she hat be uncomfortable and what be we all do now she ask i don't quite know i say thoughtfully you still go to rhodesia of course to keep an eye on pagett and you that be just my difficulty have chichester go on the _kilmorden or have he not do he mean to carry out his original plan of go to durban the hour of his leave muizenberg seem to point to an affirmative answer to both question in that case i might go to durban by train i fancy that i should get there before the boat on the other hand if the news of my escape be wire to chichester and also the information that i have leave cape town for durban nothing be simpler for him than to leave the boat at either port elizabeth or east london and so give me the slip completely it be rather a knotty problem we'll inquire about train to durban anyway i say and it's not too late for morning tea say suzanne we'll have it in the lounge the durban train leave at that even so they tell me at the office for the moment i postpone decision and join suzanne for somewhat belated eleven o'clock tea do you feel that you would really recognize chichester again in any other disguise i mean ask suzanne i shake my head ruefully i certainly didn't recognize him a the stewardess and never should have but for your draw the man's a professional actor i'm sure of it say suzanne thoughtfully his make up be perfectly marvelous he might come off the boat a a navvy or something and you'd never spot him you're

in a fair way towards find what the secret be which the old musgraves have think it necessary to embalm in so curious a fashion there be two guide give u to start with an oak and an elm a to the oak there could be no question at all right in front of the house upon the leave hand side of the drive there stand a patriarch among oak one of the most magnificent tree that i have ever see 'that be there when your ritual be draw up say i a we drive past it 'it be there at the norman conquest in all probability he answer 'it have a girth of twenty three foot 'have you any old elm i ask 'there use to be a very old one over yonder but it be strike by lightning ten year ago and we cut down the stump 'you can see where it use to be 'oh yes 'there be no other elm 'no old one but plenty of beech 'i should like to see where it grow we have drive up in a dog cart and my client lead me away at once without our enter the house to the scar on the lawn where the elm have stand it be nearly midway between the oak and the house my investigation seem to be progress 'i suppose it be impossible to find out how high the elm be i ask 'i can give you it at once it be sixty four foot 'how do you come to know it i ask in surprise 'when my old tutor use to give me an exercise in trigonometry it always take the shape of measure height when i be a lad i work out every tree and build in the estate this be an unexpected piece of luck my data be come more quickly than i could have reasonably hop 'tell me i ask 'did your butler ever ask you such a question reginald musgrave look at me in astonishment

show me that i be on the right road i look up at the sun it be low in the heaven and i calculate that in le than an hour it would lie just above the topmost branch of the old oak one condition mention

shadow would fall when the sun be just clear of the oak that must have be difficult holmes when the elm be no longer there well at least i know that if brunton could do it i could also besides there be no real difficulty i go with musgrave to his study and whittle myself this peg to which i tie this long string with a knot at each yard then i take two length of a fish rod which come to just six foot and i go back with my client to where the elm have be the sun be just graze the top of the oak i fasten the rod on end mark out the direction of the shadow and measure it it be nine foot in length of course the calculation now be a simple one if a rod of six foot throw a shadow of nine a tree of sixty four foot would throw one of ninety six and the line of the one would of course be the

notebook and tuppence begin write busily shall we begin 'young officer twice wound in the war certainly not oh very well my dear boy but i can assure you that that sort of thing might touch the heart of an elderly spinster and she might adopt you and then there would be no need for you to be a young adventurer at all i don't want to be adopt i forget you have a prejudice against it i be only rag

consider her vehemence unnatural y e she be so very violent i wonder really whether she be quite sane on that point poirot shake his head energetically no no you be on a wrong tack there there be nothing weak mind or degenerate about miss howard she be an excellent specimen of well balance english beef and brawn she be sanity itself yet her hatred of inglethorp seem almost a mania my idea be a very ridiculous one no doubt that she have intend to poison him and that in some way mr inglethorp get hold of it by mistake but i don't at all see how it could have be do the whole thing be absurd and ridiculous to the last degree still you be right in one thing it be always wise to suspect everybody until you can prove logically and to your own satisfaction that they be innocent now what reason be there against miss howard's have deliberately poison mr inglethorp why she be devote to her i exclaim tcha tcha cry poirot irritably you argue like a child if miss howard be capable of poison the old lady she would be quite equally capable of simulate devotion no we must look elsewhere you be perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against alfred inglethorp be too violent to be natural but you be quite wrong in the deduction you draw from it i have draw my own deduction which i believe to be correct but i will not speak of them at present he pause a minute then go on now to my way of think there be one insuperable objection to miss howard's be the murder and that be that in no possible way could mr inglethorp's death benefit miss howard now there be no murder without a motive i reflect could not mr inglethorp have make a will in her favor poirot shake his head but you yourself suggest that possibility to mr well poirot smile that be for a reason i do not want to mention the name of the person who be actually in my mind miss howard occupy very much the same position so i use her name instead still mr inglethorp might have do so why that will make on the afternoon of her death may but poirot's shake of the head be so energetic that i stop no my friend i have certain little idea of my own about that will but i can tell you this much it be not in miss howard's favor i accept his assurance though i do not really see how he could be so positive about the matter well i say with a sigh we will acquit miss howard then it be partly your fault that i ever come to suspect her it be what you say about her evidence at the inquest that set me off poirot look puzzle what do i say about her evidence at the inquest don't you remember when i cite her and john cavendish a be above suspicion oh ah yes he seem a little confuse but recover himself by the way hastings there be something i want you to do for me certainly what be it next time you happen to be alone with lawrence cavendish i want you to say this to him 'i have a message for you from poirot he say find the extra coffee cup and you can rest in peace nothing more nothing le 'find the extra coffee cup and you can rest in peace be that right i ask much mystify excellent but what do it mean ah that i will leave you to find out you have access to the fact just say that to him and see what he say very well but it's all extremely mysterious we be run into tadminster now and poirot direct the car to the analytical chemist poirot hop down briskly and go inside in a few minute he be back again there he say that be all my business what be you do there i ask in lively curiosity i leave something to be analyze yes but what the sample of cocoa i take from the saucepan in the bedroom but that have already be test i cry stupefy dr bauerstein have it test and you yourself laugh at the possibility of there be strychnine in it i know dr bauerstein have it test reply poirot quietly well then well i have a fancy for have it analyze again that be all and not another word on the subject could i drag out of him this proceed of poirot's in respect of the cocoa puzzle me intensely i could see neither rhyme nor reason in it however my confidence in him which at one time have rather wan be fully restore since his belief in alfred inglethorp's innocence have be so

see how anyone could blame u for jump to the conclusion we do still there it be we be in the wrong and now there's a beastly feel that one ought to make amend which be difficult when one doesn't like the fellow a bite better than one do before the whole thing's damn awkward and i'm thankful he's have the tact to take himself off it's a good thing style wasn't the mater's to leave to him couldn't

appositely but it wasn't till i hear that the order for tommy's execution come right on the heel of our interview with him that sunday that i begin to tumble to the fact that he be the big bug himself i never suspect it at all lament tuppence i've always think i be so much cleverer than tommy but he's undoubtedly score over me handsomely julius agree tommy's be the good this trip and instead of sit there a dumb a a fish let him banish his blush and tell u all about it hear hear there's nothing to tell say tommy acutely uncomfortable i be an awful mug right up to the time i find that photograph

the face of it it seem that he or sir jam must have do the trick but i didn't know which find that photograph in the drawer after that story of how it have be get from him by inspector brown make me suspect julius then i remember that it be sir jam who have discover the false jane finn in the end i couldn't make up my mind and just decide to take no chance either way i leave a note for julius in case he be mr brown say i be off to the argentine and i drop sir james's letter with the offer of the job by the desk so that he would see it be a genuine stunt then i write my letter to mr carter and ring up sir jam take him into my confidence would be the best thing either way so i tell him everything except where i believe the paper to be hide the way he help me to get on the track of tuppence and annette almost disarm me but not quite i keep my mind open between the two of them and then i get a bogus note from tuppence and i know but how tommy take the note in question from his pocket and pas it round the table it's her handwrite all right but i know it wasn't from her because of the signature she'd never spell her name 'twopence but anyone who'd never see it write might quite easily do so julius _had_ see it he show me a note of hers to him once but _sir jam hadn't after that everything be plain sail i send off albert post haste to mr carter i pretend to go away but double back again when julius come burst up in his car i felt it wasn't part of mr brown's plan and that there would probably be trouble unless sir jam be actually catch in the act so to speak i know mr carter would never believe it of him on my bare word i didn't interpose mr carter ruefully that's why i send the girl off to sir jam i be sure they'd fetch up at the house in soho sooner or later i threaten julius with the revolver because i want tuppence to repeat that to sir jam so that he wouldn't worry about u the moment the girl be out of sight i tell julius to drive like hell for london and a we go

memory which haunt her and sometimes i suspect barrymore of be a domestic tyrant i have always felt that there be something singular and questionable in this man's character but the adventure of last night bring all my suspicion to a head and yet it may seem a small matter in itself you be aware that i be not a very sound sleeper and since i have be on guard in this house my slumber have be lighter than ever last night about two in the morning i be arouse by a stealthy step pas my room i rise open my door and peep out a long black shadow be trail down the corridor it be throw by a man who walk softly down the passage with a candle hold in his hand he be in shirt and trouser with no cover to his foot i could merely see the outline but his height tell me that it be barrymore he walk very slowly and circumspectly and there be something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance i have tell you that the corridor be break by the balcony which run round the hall but that it be resume upon the farther side i wait until he have pas out of sight and then i follow him when i come round the balcony he have reach the end of the farther corridor and i could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he have enter one of the room now all these room be unfurnished and unoccupied so that his expedition become more mysterious than ever the light shine steadily a if he be stand motionless i creep down the passage a noiselessly a i could and peep round the corner of the door barrymore be crouch at the window with the candle hold against the glass his profile be half turn towards me and his face seem to be rigid with expectation a he star out into the blackness of the moor for some minute he stand watch intently then he give a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light instantly i make my way back to my room and very shortly come the stealthy step pas once more upon their return journey long afterwards when i have fall into a light sleep i hear a key turn somewhere in a lock but i could not tell whence the sound come what it all mean i cannot guess but there be some secret business go on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of i do not trouble you with my theory for you ask me to furnish you only with fact i have have a long talk with sir henry this morning and we have make a plan of campaign found upon my observation of last night i will not speak about it just now but it should make my next report interest read baskerville hall oct 15th my dear holmes if i be compel to leave you without much news during the early day of my mission you must acknowledge that i be make up for lose time and that event be now crowd thick and fast upon u in my last report i end upon my top note with barrymore at the window and now i have quite a budget already which will unless i be much mistake considerably surprise you thing have take a turn which i could not have anticipate in some way they have within the last forty eight hour become much clearer and in some way they have become more complicate but i will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself before breakfast on the morning follow my adventure i go down the corridor and examine the room in which barrymore have be on the night before the western window through which he have star so intently have i notice one peculiarity above all other window in the house it command the nearest outlook on to the moor there be an open between two tree which enable one from this point of view to look right down upon it while from all the other window it be only a distant glimpse which can be obtain it follow therefore that barrymore since only this window would serve the purpose must have be look out for something or somebody upon the moor the night be very dark so that i can hardly imagine how he could have hop to see anyone it have strike me that it be possible that some love intrigue be on foot that would have account for his stealthy movement and also for the uneasiness of his wife the man be a strike look fellow very well equip to steal the heart of a country girl so that this theory seem to have something to support it that open of the door which i have hear after i have return to my room might mean that he have go out to keep some clandestine appointment so i reason with myself in the morning and i tell you the direction of my suspicion however much the result may have show that they be unfounded but whatever the true explanation of barrymore's movement might be i felt that the responsibility of keep them to myself until i could explain them be more than i could bear i have an interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast and i tell him all that i have see he be le surprise than i have expect i know that barrymore walk about night and i have a mind to speak to him about it say he two or three time i have hear his step in the passage come and go just about the hour you name perhaps then he pay a visit every night to that particular window i suggest perhaps he do if so we should be able to shadow him and see what it be that he be after i wonder what your friend holmes would do if he be here i believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest say i he would follow barrymore and see what he do then we shall do it together but surely he would hear u

that i would just ask you whether you have hear it 'no i have not it must be those wretched gypsy in the plantation 'very likely and yet if it be on the lawn i wonder that you do not hear it also 'ah

proceed with your statement i could not sleep that night a vague feel of impend misfortune impress me my sister and i you will recollect be twin and you know how subtle be the link which bind two soul which be so closely ally it be a wild night the wind be howl outside and the rain be beat and splash against the window suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale there burst forth the wild scream of a terrify woman i know that it be my sister's voice i spring from my bed wrap a shawl round me and rush into the corridor a i open my door i seem to hear a low whistle such a my sister describe and a few moment later a clang sound a if a mass of metal have fall a i run down the passage my sister's door be unlock and revolve slowly upon it hinge i star at it horror stricken not know what be about to issue from it by the light of the corridor lamp i saw my sister appear at the open her face blanch with terror her hand grope for help her whole figure sway to and fro like that of a drunkard i run to her and throw my arm round her but at that moment her knee seem to give way and she fell to the grind she writhe a one who be in terrible pain and her limb be dreadfully convulse at first i think that she have not recognize me but a i bend over her she suddenly shriek out in a voice which i shall never forget 'oh my god helen it be the band the speckle band there be something else which she would fain have say and she stab with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor's room but a fresh convulsion seize her and choke her word i rush out call loudly for my stepfather and i meet him hasten from his room in his dress gown when he reach my sister's side she be unconscious and though he pour brandy down her throat and send for medical aid from the village all effort be in vain for she slowly sink and die without have recover her consciousness such be the dreadful end of my beloved sister one moment say holmes be you sure about this whistle and metallic sound could you swear to it that be what the county coroner ask me at the inquiry it be my strong impression that i hear it and yet among the crash of the gale and the creak of an old house i may possibly have be deceive be your sister dress no she be in her night dress in her right hand be find the char stump of a match and in her leave a match box show that she have strike a light and look about her when the alarm take place that be important and what conclusion do the coroner come to he investigate the case with great care for dr roylott's conduct have long be notorious in the county but he be unable to find any satisfactory cause of death my evidence show that the door have be fasten upon the inner side and the window be block by old fashion shutter with broad iron bar which be secure every night the wall be carefully sound and be show to be quite solid all round and the floor be also thoroughly examine with the same result the chimney be wide but be bar up by four large staple it be certain therefore that my sister be quite alone when she meet her end besides there be no mark of any violence upon her how about poison the doctor examine her for it but without success what do you think that this unfortunate lady die of then it be my belief that she die of pure fear and nervous shock though what it be that frighten her i cannot imagine be there gypsy in the plantation at the time yes there be nearly always some there ah and what do you gather from this allusion to a band a speckle band sometimes i have think that it be merely the wild talk of delirium sometimes that it may have

might honor me by become my wife that seem to make the matter no better so then i lose my temper too and i answer him rather more hotly than i should perhaps consider that she be stand by so it end by his go off with her a you saw and here be i a badly puzzle a man a any in this county just tell me what it all mean watson and i'll owe you more than ever i can hope to pay i try one or two explanation but indeed i be completely puzzle myself our friend's title his fortune his age his character and his appearance be all in his favor and i know nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which run in his family that his advance should be reject so brusquely without any reference to the lady's own wish and that the lady should accept the situation without protest be very amaze however our conjecture be set at rest by a visit from stapleton himself that very afternoon he have come to offer apology for his rudeness of the morning and after a long private interview with sir henry in his study the upshot of their conversation be that the breach be quite heal and that we be to dine at merripit house next friday a a sign of it i don't say now that he isn't a crazy man say sir henry i can't forget the look in his eye when he run at me this morning but i must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he have do do he give any explanation of his conduct his sister be everything in his life he say that be natural enough and i be glad that he should understand her value they have always be together and accord to his account he have be a very lonely man with only her a a companion so that the think of lose her be really terrible to him he have not understand he say that i be become attach to her but when he saw with his own eye that it be really so and that she might be take away from him it give him such a shock that for a time he be not responsible for what he say or do he be very sorry for all that have pas and he recognize how foolish and how selfish it be that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life if she have to leave him he have rather it be to a neighbor like myself than to anyone else but in any case it be a blow to him and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself to meet it he would withdraw all opposition upon his part if i would promise for three month to let the matter rest and to be content with cultivate the lady's friendship during that time without claim her love this i promise and so the matter rest so there be one of our small

thirdly if you wish endeavor to cut him out with mademoiselle marthe but i fear you will not have great success i do not quite relish the last remark that remind me i say i mean to ask you how you know about those two _mon ami___ i know human nature throw together a boy young renauld and a beautiful girl like mademoiselle marthe and the result be almost inevitable then the quarrel it be money or a woman and remember leonie's description of the lad's anger i decide on the latter so i make my guess and i be right and that be why you warn me against set my heart on the lady you already suspect that she love young renauld poirot smile at any rate _i saw that she have anxious eye that be how always think of mademoiselle daubreuil _as the girl with the anxious eye his voice be so grave that it impress me uncomfortably what do you mean by that poirot i fancy my friend that we shall see before very long but i must start you've ocean of time perhaps perhaps but i like plenty of leisure at the station i do not wish to rush to hurry to excite myself at all event i say rise i will come and see you off you will do nothing of the sort i forbid it he be so peremptory that i star at him in surprise he nod emphatically i mean it _mon ami___ au revoir you permit that i embrace you ah no i forget that it be not the english custom une poignee de main alors i felt rather at a loose end after poirot have leave me i stroll down the beach and watch the bather without feel energetic enough to join them i rather fancy that cinderella might be disport herself amongst them in some wonderful costume but i saw no sign of her i stroll aimlessly along the sand towards the further end of the town it occur to me that after all it would only be decent feel on my part to inquire after the girl and it would save trouble in the end the matter would then be finish with there would be no need for me to trouble about her any further but if i do not go at all she might quite possibly come and look me up at the villa and that would be annoy in every way decidedly it would be better to pay a short call in the course of which i could make it quite clear that i could do nothing further for her in my capacity of showman accordingly i leave the beach and walk inland i soon find the hotel du phare a very unpretentious build it be annoy in the extreme not to know the lady's name and to save my dignity i decide to stroll inside and look around probably i should find her in the lounge merlinville be a small place you leave your hotel to go to the beach and you leave the beach to return to the hotel there be no other attraction there be a casino be build but it be not yet complete i have walk the length of the beach without see her therefore she must be in the hotel i go in several people be sit in the tiny lounge but my quarry be not amongst them i look into some other room but there be no sign of her i wait for some time till my impatience get the better of me i take the concierge aside and slip five franc into his hand i wish to see a lady who be stay here a young english lady small and dark i be not sure of her name the man shake his head and seem to be suppress a grin there be no such lady a you describe stay here she be american possibly i suggest these fellow be so stupid but the man continue to shake his head no monsieur there be only six or seven english and american lady altogether and they be all much older than the lady you be seek it be not here that you will find her monsieur he be so positive that i felt doubt but the lady tell me she be stay here monsieur

just a you have do what be he like he be a small gentleman well dress very neat very spotless the mustache very stiff the head of a peculiar shape and the eye green poirot so that be why he refuse to let me accompany him to the station the impertinence of it i would thank him not to meddle in my concern do he fancy i need a nurse to look after me thank the man i depart somewhat at a loss and still much incense with my meddlesome friend i regret that he be for the moment out of reach i should have enjoy tell him what i think of his unwarranted interference have i not distinctly tell him that i have no intention of see the girl decidedly one's friend can be too zealous but where be the lady i set aside my wrath and try to puzzle it out evidently through inadvertence she have name the wrong hotel then another think strike me be it inadvertence or have she deliberately withhold her name and give me the wrong address the more i think about it the more i felt convince that this last surmise of mine be right for some reason or other she do not wish to let the acquaintance ripen into friendship and though half an hour earlier this have be precisely my own view i do not enjoy have the table turn upon me the whole affair be profoundly unsatisfactory and i go up to the villa genevieve in a condition of distinct ill humor i do not go to the house but go up the path to the little bench by the shed and sit there moodily enough i be distract from my thought by the sound of voice close at hand in a second or two i realize that they come not from the garden i be in but from the adjoin

overshadow their young live but the girl's face be trouble and jack renauld seem to recognize it a he hold her closer to him and ask but what be you afraid of darling what be there to fear now and

in excellent spirit a mood which in his case alternate with fit of the blackest depression there be no great mystery in this matter he say take the cup of tea which i have pour out for him the fact appear to admit of only one explanation what you have solve it already well that would be too much to say i have discover a suggestive fact that be all it be however very suggestive the detail be still to be add i have just find on consult the back file of the time that major sholto of upper norword late of the 34th bombay infantry die upon the 28th of april i may be very obtuse holmes but i fail to see what this suggest no you surprise me look at it in this way then captain morstan disappear the only person in london whom he could have visit be major sholto major sholto deny have hear that he be in london four year later sholto die within a week of his death captain morstan's daughter receive a valuable present which be repeat from year to year and now culminate in a letter which describe her a a wrong woman what wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her father and why should the present begin immediately after sholto's death unless it be that sholto's heir know something of the mystery and desire to make compensation have you any alternative theory which will meet the fact but what a strange compensation and how strangely make why too should he write a letter now rather than six year ago again the letter speak of give her justice what justice can she have it be too much to suppose that her father be still alive there be no other injustice in her case that you know of there be difficulty there be certainly difficulty say sherlock holmes pensively but our expedition of to night will solve them all ah here be a four wheeler and miss morstan be inside be you all ready then we have better go down for it be a little past the hour i pick up my hat and my heaviest stick but i observe that holmes take his revolver from his drawer and slip it into his pocket it be clear that he think that our night's work might be a serious one miss morstan be muffle in a dark cloak and her sensitive face be compose but pale she must have be more than woman if she do not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we be embark yet her self control be perfect and she readily answer the few additional question which sherlock holmes put to her major sholto be a very particular friend of papa's she say his letter be full of allusion to the major he and papa be in command of the troop at the andaman island so they be throw a great deal

you hear how earnestly holmes insist that i should not leave you and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor sir henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile my dear fellow say he holmes with all his wisdom do not foresee some thing which have happen since i have be on the moor you understand me i be sure that you be the last man in the world who would wish to be a spoil

matter over my conscience reproach me bitterly for have on any pretext allow him to go out of my sight i imagine what my feel would be if i have to return to you and to confess that some misfortune have occur through my disregard for your instruction i assure you my cheek flush at the very think it might not even now be too late to overtake him so i set off at once in the direction of merripit house i hurry along the road at the top of my speed without see anything of sir henry until i come to the point where the moor path branch off there fear that perhaps i have come in the wrong direction after all i mount a hill from which i could command a view the same hill which be cut into the dark quarry thence i saw him at once he be on the moor path about a quarter of a mile off and a lady be by his side who could only be miss stapleton it be clear that there be already an understand between them and that they have meet by appointment they be walk slowly along in deep conversation and i saw her make quick little movement of her hand a if she be very earnest in what she be say while he listen intently and once or twice shake his head in strong dissent i stand among the rock watch them very much puzzle a to what i should do next to follow them and break into their intimate conversation seem to be an outrage and yet my clear duty be never for an instant to let him out of my sight to act the spy upon a friend be a hateful task still i could see no better course than to observe him from the hill and to clear my conscience by confess to him afterwards what i have do it be true that if any sudden danger have threaten him i be too far away to be of use and yet i be sure that you will agree with me that the position be very difficult and that there be nothing more which i could do our friend sir henry and the lady have halt on the path and be stand deeply absorb in their conversation when i be suddenly aware that i be not the only witness of their interview a

closer to the pair than i be and he appear to be move in their direction at this instant sir henry suddenly draw miss stapleton to his side his arm be round her but it seem to me that she be strain away from him with her face avert he stoop his head to hers and she raise one hand a if in protest next moment i saw them spring apart and turn hurriedly round stapleton be the cause of the interruption he be run wildly towards them his absurd net dangle behind him he gesticulate and almost dance with excitement in front of the lover what the scene mean i could not imagine but it seem to me that stapleton be abuse sir henry who offer explanation which become more angry a the other refuse to accept them the lady stand by in haughty silence finally stapleton turn upon his heel and beckon in a peremptory way to his sister who after an irresolute glance at sir henry walk off by the side of her brother the naturalist's angry gesture show that the lady be include in his displeasure the baronet stand for a minute look after them and then he walk slowly back the way that he have come his head hang the very picture of dejection what all this mean i could not imagine but i be deeply ashamed to have witness so intimate a scene without my friend's knowledge i run down the hill therefore and meet the baronet at the bottom his face be flush with anger and his brow be wrinkle like one who be at his wit's end what to do halloa watson where have you drop from say he you don't mean to say that you come after me in spite of all i explain everything to him how i have find it impossible to remain behind how i have follow him and how i have witness all that have occur for an instant his eye blaze at me but my frankness disarm his anger and he break at last into a rather rueful laugh

that where have you engage a seat i be on that hill quite in the back row eh but her brother be well up to the front do you see him come out on u yes i do do he ever strike you a be crazy this brother
