[{"label": "rinehart", "text": "The second floor be the ordinary upper storey of a small dwell house. The door be close, but loud talk, smoke, and the rattle of chip float out through open transom. From below the noise of the piano come up the staircase, unmelodious but rhythmical, and from the street on which the house face an automobile be start it engine, with a series of shoot-like explosion.  The noise be confuse, disconcert. I open two door, to find only the usual poker table, with the winner sit quietly, their card bunch in the palm of their hand, and the loser, grow more voluble a the night go on, buy chip recklessly, drink more than they should. The atmosphere be reek with smoke.  The third door I open be that of a dingy bath-room, with a zinc tub and a slovenly wash-stand. The next, however, be different. The light stream out through the transom a in the other room, but there be no noise from within. With my hand on the door, I hesitate--then, with Hunter's injunction ring in my ear, I open it and look in.  A breath of cool night air from an open window meet me. There be no noise, no smoke, no sour odour of stale beer. A table have be draw to the centre of the small room, and be litter with paper, pen and ink. At one corner be a tray, contain the remnant of a meal; a pillow and a pair of blanket on a couch at one side show the room have be serve a a bedchamber.  But none of these thing catch my eye at first. At the table, lean forward, his head on his arm, be a man. I cough, and receive no answer, step into the room.  \"I beg your pardon,\" I say, \"but I be look, for--\"  Then the truth burst on me, overwhelm me. A thin stream be spread over the paper on the table, move slowly, sluggishly, a be the way with blood when the heart pump be stop. I hurry over and raise the heavy, wobble, grey head. It be Allan Fleming and he have be shoot through the forehead.      My first impulse be to rouse the house; my second, to wait for Hunter. To turn loose that mob of half-drunken men in such a place seem profanation. There be nothing of the majesty or panoply of death here, but the very sordidness of the surround make me resolve to guard the new dignity of that figure. I be shock, of course; it would be absurd to say that I be emotionally unstring. On the contrary, I be conscious of a distinct feel of disappointment. Fleming have be our key to the Bellwood affair, and he have put himself beyond help to solve any mystery. I lock the door and stand wonder what to do next. I should have call a doctor, no doubt, but I have see enough of death to know that the man be beyond aid of any kind.  It be not until I have bolt the door that I discover the absence of any weapon. Everything that have go before have point to a position so untenable that suicide seem it natural and inevitable result. With the discovery that there be no revolver on the table or floor, the thing be more ominous. I decide at once to call the young city physician in the room across the hall, and with something approximate panic, I throw open the door--to face Harry Wardrop, and behind him, Hunter.  I do not remember that any one speak. Hunter jump past me into the room and take in in a single glance what I have labour to acquire in three minute. A Wardrop come in, Hunter lock the door behind him, and we three stand star at the prostrate figure over the table.  I watch Wardrop: I have never see so suddenly abject a picture. He drop into a chair, and feel for his handkerchief, wipe his shake lip; every particle of colour leave his face, and he be limp, unnerve.  \"Do you hear the shoot?\" Hunter ask me. \"It have be a matter of minute since it happen.\"  \"I don't know,\" I say, bewilder. \"I hear a lot of explosion, but I think it be an automobile, out in the street.\"  Hunter be listen while he examine the room, peer under the table, lift the blanket that have trail off the couch on to the floor. Some one outside try the door-knob, and find the door lock, shake it slightly.  \"Fleming!\" he call under his breath. \"Fleming!\"  We be silent, in response to a signal from Hunter, and the step retreat heavily down the hall. The detective spread the blanket decently over the couch, and the three of u move the body there. Wardrop be almost collapse.  \"Now,\" Hunter say quietly, \"before I call in Doctor Gray from the room across, what do you know about this thing, Mr. Wardrop?\"  Wardrop look daze.  \"He be in a bad way when I leave this morning,\" he say huskily. \"There isn't much use now try to hide anything; God know I've do all I could. But he have be use cocaine for year, and to-day he run out of the stuff. When I get here, about half an hour ago, he be on the verge of kill himself. I get the revolver from him--he be like a crazy man, and a soon a I dare to leave him, I go out to try and find a doctor--\"  \"To get some cocaine?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Not--because he be already wound, and you be afraid it be fatal?\"  Wardrop shudder; then he pull himself together, and his tone be more natural.  \"What's the use of lie about it?\" he say wearily. \"You won't believe me if I tell the truth, either, but--he be dead when I get here. I hear something like the bang of a door a I go up-stair, but the noise be terrific down below, and I couldn't tell. When I go in, he be just drop forward, and--\" he hesitate.  \"The revolver?\" Hunter query, lynx-eye.  \"Be in his hand. He be dead then.\"  \"Where be the revolver?\"  \"I will turn it over to the coroner.\"  \"You will give it to me,\" Hunter reply sharply. And after a little fumble, Wardrop produce it from his hip pocket. It be an ordinary thirty-eight. The detective open it and glance at it. Two chamber be empty.  \"And you wait--say ten minute, before you call for help, and even then you go outside hunt a doctor! What be you do in those ten minute?\"  Wardrop shut his lip and refuse to reply.  \"If Mr. Fleming shoot himself,\" the detective pursue relentlessly, \"there would be powder mark around the wind. Then, too, he be in the act of write a letter. It be a strange impulse, this--you see, he have only write a dozen word.\"  I glance at the paper on the table. The letter have no superscription; it begin abruptly:       \"I shall have to leave here. The number have follow me.      To-night--\"  That be all.  \"This be not suicide,\" Hunter say gravely. \"It be murder, and I warn you, Mr. Wardrop, to be careful what you say. Will you ask Doctor Gray to come in, Mr. Knox?\"  I go across the hall to the room where the noise be loudest. Fortunately, Doctor Gray be out of the game. He be open a can of caviar at a table in the corner and come out in response to a gesture. He do not ask any question, and I let him go into the death chamber unprepared. The presence of death apparently have no effect on him, but the identity of the dead man almost stupefy him.  \"Fleming!\" he say, awe, a he look down at the body. \"Fleming, by all that's sacred! And a suicide!\"  Hunter watch him grimly.  \"How long have he be dead?\" he ask.  The doctor glance at the bullet wind in the forehead, and from there significantly to the group around the couch.  \"Not an hour--probably le than half,\" he say. \"It's strange we hear nothing, across the hall there.\"  Hunter take a clean fold handkerchief from his pocket and open"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "For a moment she struggle for self-control, and then abandon all presence, she hold it to her lip and burst into a fit of sob. \"Oh, Tommy, Tommy,\" she cry, \"I do love you so--and I may never see you again....\" At the end of five minute Tuppence He give her an emphatic little nod. \"Quite right, Miss Tuppence. You scent danger. So do I. So do Miss Finn.\" \"Yes,\" admit Jane. \"It's absurd--but I can't help it.\" Sir Jam nod again. \"You feel--a we all feel-- _the presence of Mr. Bown_. Yes\"--a Tuppence make a movement--\"not a doubt of it-- _Mr. Brown be here_....\" \"In this house?\" \"In this room.... You don't understand? _I be Mr. Brown_....\" Stupefy, unbelieving, they star at him. The very line of his face have change. It be a different man who stand before them. He smile a slow cruel smile. \"Neither of you will leave this room alive! You say just now we have succeed. _I_ have succeed! The draft treaty be mine.\" His smile grow wider a he look at Tuppence. \"Shall I tell you how it will be? Sooner or later the police will break in, and they will find three victim of Mr. Brown--three, not two, you understand, but fortunately the third will not be dead, only wound, and will be able to describe the attack with a wealth of detail! The treaty? It be in the hand of Mr. Brown. So no one will think of search the pocket of Sir Jam Peel Edgerton!\" He turn to Jane. \"You outwit me. I make my acknowledgment. But you will not do it again.\" There be a faint sound behind him, but, intoxicate with success, he do not turn his head. He slip his hand into his pocket. \"Checkmate to the Young Adventurer,\" he say, and slowly raise the big automatic. But, even a he do so, he felt himself seize from behind in a grip of iron. The revolver be wrench from his hand, and the voice of Julius Hersheimmer say drawlingly: \"I guess you're catch redhanded with the good upon you.\" The blood rush to the K.C. 's face, but his self-control be marvelous, a he look from one to the other of his two captor. He look longest at Tommy. \"You,\" he say beneath his breath. \"_You!_ I might have know.\" See that he be dispose to offer no resistance, their grip slacken. Quick a a flash his leave hand, the hand which bore the big signet ring, be raise to his lip.... \"'_Ave, Caesar! te morituri salutant_,'\" he say, still look at Tommy. Then his face change, and with a long convulsive shudder he fell forward in a crumple heap, whilst an odor of bitter almond fill the air. THE supper party give by Mr. Julius Hersheimmer to a few friend on the even of the 30th will long be remember in cater circle. It take place in a private room, and Mr. Hersheimmer's order be brief and forcible. He give carte blanche--and when a millionaire give carte blanche he usually get it! Every delicacy out of season be duly provide. Waiter carry bottle of ancient and royal vintage with love care. The floral decoration defy the season, and fruit of the earth a far apart a May and November find themselves miraculously side by side. The list of guest be small and select. The American Ambassador, Mr. Carter, who have take the liberty, he say, of bring an old friend, Sir William Beresford, with him, Archdeacon Cowley, Dr. Hall, those two youthful adventurer, Miss Prudence Cowley and Mr. Thomas Beresford, and last, but not least, a guest of honor, Miss Jane Finn. Julius have spar no pain to make Jane's appearance a success. A mysterious knock have bring Tuppence to the door of the apartment she be share with the American girl. It be Julius. In his hand he hold a check. \"Say, Tuppence,\" he begin, \"will you do me a good turn? Take this, and get Jane regularly tog up for this even. You're all come to supper with me at the _Savoy_. See? Spare no expense. You get me?\" \"Sure thing,\" mimic Tuppence. \"We shall enjoy ourselves. It will be a pleasure dress Jane. She's the loveliest thing I've ever see.\" \"That's so,\" agree Mr. Hersheimmer fervently. His fervor bring a momentary twinkle to Tuppence's eye. \"By the way, Julius,\" she remark demurely, \"I--haven't give you my answer yet.\" \"Answer?\" say Julius. His face pal. \"You know--when you ask me to--marry you,\" falter Tuppence, her eye downcast in the true manner of the early Victorian heroine, \"and wouldn't take no for an answer. I've think it well over----\" \"Yes?\" say Julius. The perspiration stand on his forehead. Tuppence relent suddenly. \"You great idiot!\" she say. \"What on earth induce you to do it? I could see at the time you didn't care a twopenny dip for me!\" \"Not at all. I have--and still have--the highest sentiment of esteem and respect--and admiration for you----\" \"H'm!\" say Tuppence. \"Those be the kind of sentiment that very soon go to the wall when the other sentiment come along! Don't they, old thing?\" \"I don't know what you mean,\" say Julius stiffly, but a large and burn blush overspread his countenance. \"Shuck!\" retort Tuppence. She laugh, and close the door, reopen it to add with dignity: \"Morally, I shall always consider I have be jilt!\" \"What be it?\" ask Jane a Tuppence rejoin her. \"Julius.\" \"What do he want?\" \"Really, I think, he want to see you, but I wasn't go to let him. Not until to-night, when you're go to burst upon every one like King Solomon in his glory! Come on! _We're go to shop!_\" To most people the 29th, the much-herald \"Labour Day,\" have pas much a any other day. Speech be make in the Park and Trafalgar Square. Straggle procession, sing the _Red Flag_, wander through the street in a more or le aimless manner. Newspaper which have hint at a general strike, and the inauguration of a reign of terror, be force to hide their diminish head. The bolder and more astute among them seek to prove that peace have be effect by follow their counsel. In the Sunday paper a brief notice of the sudden death of Sir Jam Peel Edgerton, the famous K.C., have appear. Monday's paper deal appreciatively with the dead man's career. The exact manner of his sudden death be never make public. Tommy have be right in his forecast of the situation. It have be a one-man show. Deprive of their chief, the organization fell to piece. Kramenin have make a precipitate return to Russia, leave England early on Sunday morning. The gang have flee from Astley Prior in a panic, leave behind, in their haste, various damage document which compromise them hopelessly. With these proof of conspiracy in their hand, aid further by a small brown diary take from the pocket of the dead man which have contain a full and damn resume of the whole plot, the Government have call an eleventh-hour conference. The Labour leader be force to recognize that they have be use a a cat's paw. Certain concession be make by the Government, and be eagerly accept. It be to be Peace, not War! But the Cabinet know by how narrow a margin they have escape utter disaster. And burn in on Mr. Carter's brain be the strange scene which have take place in the house in Soho the night before. He have enter the squalid room to find that great man, the friend of a lifetime, dead--betray out of his own mouth. From the dead man's pocket-book he have retrieve the ill-omen draft treaty, and then and there, in the presence of the other three, it have be reduce to ash.... England be save! And now, on the even of the 30th, in a private room at the _Savoy_, Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer be receive his guest. Mr. Carter be the first to arrive. With him be a choleric-look old gentleman, at sight of whom Tommy flush up to the root of his hair. He come forward. \"Ha!\" say the old gentleman, survey him apoplectically. \"So you're"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "It be not overboard, Mr. John,\" I say gravely.  \"It be lock in a safe place, where it will remain until the police come to take it.\"  \"You be rather theatrical, aren't you?\" she scoff, and turn away. But a second later she come back to me, and put her hand on my arm. \"Tell me where it be,\" she beg.  \"You be make a mystery of it, and I detest mystery.\"  I saw under her mask of lightness then: she want desperately to know where the axe be.  Her eye fell, under my gaze.  \"I be sorry.  There be no mystery.  It be simply lock away for safe-keep.\"  She bite her lip.  \"Do you know what I think?\" she say slowly.  \"I think you have hypnotise the crew, a you do me--at first.  Why have no one remember that you be in the after house last night, that you find poor Wilmer Vail, that you raise the alarm, that you discover the captain and Karen?  Why should I not call the men here and remind them of all that?\"  \"I do not believe you will.  They know I be lock in the storeroom. The door--the lock--\"  \"You could have lock yourself in.\"  \"You do not know what you be say!\"  But I have anger her, and she go on cruelly:--  \"Who be you, anyhow?  You be not a sailor.  You come here and be take on because you tell a hard-luck storey.  How do we know that you come from a hospital?  Men just out of prison look a you do. Do you know what we call you, the first two day out?  We call you Elsa's gaol-bird  And now, because you have dominate the crew, we be in your hand!\"  \"Do Mr. Turner and Miss Lee think that?\"  \"They feel a I do.  This be a pick crew men the Turner line have employ for year.\"  \"You be very brave, Mr. John,\" I say.  \"If I be what you think I be, I would be a dangerous enemy.\"  \"I be not afraid of you.\"  I think fast.  She be right.  It have not occur to me before, but it sweep over me overwhelmingly.  \"You be leave me only one thing to do,\" I say.  \"I shall surrender myself to the men at once.\"  I take out my revolver and hold it out to her.  \"This rope be a dead-line.  The crew know, and you will have no trouble; but you must stand guard here until some one else be send.\"  She take the revolver without a word, and, somewhat daze by this new turn of event, I go aft.  The men be gather there, and I surrender myself.  They listen in silence while I tell them the situation.  Burn, who have be try to sleep, sit up and star at me incredulously.  \"It will leave you pretty short-hand, boy,\" I finish, \"but you'd better fasten me up somewhere.  But I want to be sure of one thing first: whatever happen, keep the guard for the woman.\"  \"We'd like to talk it over, Leslie,\" Burn say, after a word with the others.  I go forward a few foot, take care to remain where they could see me, and very soon they call me.  There have be a dispute, I believe. Adam and Mcnamara stand off from the others, their face not unfriendly, but clearly differ from the decision.  Charlie Jones, who, by reason of long service and a sort of pious control he have in the forecastle, be generally spokesman for the crew, take a step or two toward me.  \"We'll not do it, boy,\" he say.  \"We think we know a man when we see one, a well a have occasion to know that you're white all through. And we're not incline to set the talk of woman against what we think best to do.  So you stick to your job, and we're back of you.\"  In spite of myself, I choke up.  I try to tell them what their loyalty mean to me; but I could only hold out my hand, and, one by one, they come up and shake it solemnly.  \"We think,\" Mcnamara say, when, last of all, he and Adam come up, \"that it would be best, lad, if we put down in the log-book all that have happen last night and to-day, and this just now, too.  It's fresh in our mind now, and it will be something to go by.\"  So Burn and I get the log-book from the captain's cabin.  The axe be there, where we have place it earlier in the day, lie on the white cover of the bed.  The room be untouched, a the dead man have leave it--a collar on the stand, brush put down hastily, a half-smoke cigar which have burn a long scar on the wood before it have go out. We go out silently, Burn carry the book, I lock the door behind u.  Mr. John, sit near the companionway with the revolver on her knee, look up and eye me coolly.  \"So they would not do it!\"  \"I be sorry to disappoint you--they would not.\"  She hold up my revolver to me, and smile cynically.  \"Remember,\" she say, \"I only say you be a possibility.\"  \"Thank you; I shall remember.\"  By unanimous consent, the task of put down what have happen be give to me.  I have a copy of the log-book before me now, the one that be use at the trial.  The men read it through before they sign it.                                                     August thirteenth.  This morning, between two-thirty and three o'clock, three murder be commit on the yacht Ella.  At the request of Mr. John, one of the party on board, I have move to the after house to sleep, put my blanket and pillow in the storeroom and sleep on the floor there. Mr. John give, a her reason, a fear of something go wrong, a there be trouble between Mr. Turner and the captain. I sleep with a revolver beside me and with the door of the storeroom open.  At some time shortly before three o'clock I waken with a feel of suffocation, and find that the door be close and lock on the outside.  I suspect a joke among the crew, and set to work with my pen-knife to unscrew the lock.  When I have two screw out, a woman scream, and I break down the door.  A the main cabin be dark, I saw no one and could not tell where the cry come from.  I run into Mr. Vail's cabin, next the storeroom, and call him.  His door be stand open.  I hear him breathe heavily.  Then the breathe stop.  I strike a match, and find him dead.  His head have be crush in with an axe, the leave hand cut off, and there be gash on the right shoulder and the abdomen.  I know the helmsman would be at the wheel, and run up the after companionway to him and tell him.  Then I run forward and call the first mate, Mr. Singleton, who be on duty.  He have be drink. I ask him to call the captain, but he do not.  He get his revolver, and we hurry down the forward companion.  The body of the captain be lie at the foot of the step, his head on the lowest stair.  He have be kill like Mr. Vail.  His cap have be place over his face.  The mate collapse on the step.  I find the light switch and turn it on.  There be no one in the cabin or in the chart-room.  I run to Mr. Turner's room, go through Mr. I look after him until he turn the next corner, and I know I have not be mistake; it be Wardrop.  The next minute Hunter appear, from the same direction, and we walk quickly together. I tell him who the man just ahead have be, and he nod without surprise. But before we turn the next corner he stop.  \"Do you ever hear of the White Cat?\" he ask. \"Little political club?\"  \"Never.\"  \"I'm a member of it,\" he go on rapidly. \"It's run by the city ring, or rather it run itself. Be a good fellow while"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "Holmes,\" say the inspector, earnestly. \"In that case I should be glad to hear the evidence and to examine the premise without an instant of unnecessary delay.\" Inspector Martin have the good sense to allow my friend to do thing in his own fashion, and content himself with carefully note the result. The local surgeon, an old, white-haired man, have just come down from Mr. Hilton Cubitt's room, and he report that her injury be serious, but not necessarily fatal. The bullet have pas through the front of her brain, and it would probably be some time before she could regain consciousness. On the question of whether she have be shoot or have shoot herself he would not venture to express any decide opinion. Certainly the bullet have be discharge at very close quarter. There be only the one pistol find in the room, two barrel of which have be empty. Mr. Hilton Cubitt have be shoot through the heart. It be equally conceivable that he have shoot her and then himself, or that she have be the criminal, for the revolver lay upon the floor midway between them. \"Have he be move?\" ask Holmes. \"We have move nothing except the lady. We could not leave her lie wound upon the floor.\" \"How long have you be here, doctor?\" \"Since four o'clock.\" \"Anyone else?\" \"Yes, the constable here.\" \"And you have touch nothing?\" \"Nothing.\" \"You have act with great discretion. Who send for you?\" \"The housemaid, Saunders.\" \"Be it she who give the alarm?\" \"She and Mr. King, the cook.\" \"Where be they now?\" \"In the kitchen, I believe.\" \"Then I think we have better hear their story at once.\" The old hall, oak-panel and high-windowed, have be turn into a court of investigation. Holmes sit in a great, old-fashion chair, his inexorable eye gleam out of his haggard face. I could read in them a set purpose to devote his life to this quest until the client whom he have fail to save should at last be avenge. The trim Inspector Martin, the old, gray-head country doctor, myself, and a stolid village policeman make up the rest of that strange company. The two woman tell their story clearly enough. They have be arouse from their sleep by the sound of an explosion, which have be follow a minute later by a second one. They sleep in adjoin room, and Mr. King have rush in to Saunders. Together they have descend the stair. The door of the study be open and a candle be burn upon the table. Their master lay upon his face in the center of the room. He be quite dead. Near the window his wife be crouch, her head lean against the wall. She be horribly wound, and the side of her face be red with blood. She breathe heavily, but be incapable of say anything. The passage, a well a the room, be full of smoke and the smell of powder. The window be certainly shut and fasten upon the inside. Both woman be positive upon the point. They have at once send for the doctor and for the constable. Then, with the aid of the groom and the stable-boy, they have convey their injure mistress to her room. Both she and her husband have occupy the bed. She be clothe in her dress--he in his dress-gown, over his night clothe. Nothing have be move in the study. So far a they know there have never be any quarrel between husband and wife. They have always look upon them a a very unite couple. These be the main point of the servants' evidence. In answer to Inspector Martin they be clear that every door be fasten upon the inside, and that no one could have escape from the house. He open one of his hand and look at a note crumple up in his palm. \"See here, mister,\" he cry, with a gleam of suspicion in his eye, \"you're not try to scare me over this, be you? If the lady be hurt a bad a you say, who be it that write this note?\" He toss it forward on to the table. \"I write it to bring you here.\" \"You write it? There be no one on earth outside the Joint who know the secret of the dance men. How come you to write it?\" \"What one man can invent another can discover,\" say Holmes. There be a cab come to convey you to Norwich, Mr. Slaney. But, meanwhile, you have time to make some small reparation for the injury you have work. Be you aware that Mr. Hilton Cubitt have herself lie under grave suspicion of the murder of her husband, and that it be only my presence here and the knowledge which I happen to posse which have save her from the accusation? The least that you owe her be to make it clear to the whole world that she be in no way, directly or indirectly, responsible for his tragic end.\" \"I ask nothing better,\" say the American. \"I guess the very best case I can make for myself be the absolute naked truth.\" \"It be my duty to warn you that it will be use against you,\" cry the inspector, with the magnificent fair-play of the British criminal law. Slaney shrug his shoulder. \"I'll chance that,\" say he. \"First of all, I want you gentleman to understand that I have know this lady since she be a child. There be seven of u in a gang in Chicago, and Elsie's father be the bos of the Joint. He be a clever man, be old Patrick. It be he who invent that write, which would pas a a child's scrawl unless you just happen to have the key to it. Well, Elsie learn some of our way; but she couldn't stand the business, and she have a bite of honest money of her own, so she give u all the slip and get away to London. She have be engage to me, and she would have marry me, I believe, if I have take over another profession; but she would have nothing to do with anything on the cross. It be only after her marriage to this Englishman that I be able to find out where she be. I write to her, but get no answer. After that I come over, and, a letter be no use, I put my message where she could read them. \"Well, I have be here a month now. I live in that farm, where I have a room down below, and could get in and out every night, and no one the wiser. I try all I could to coax Elsie away. I know that she read the message, for once she write an answer under one of them. Then my temper get the better of me, and I begin to threaten her. She send me a letter then, implore me to go away and say that it would break her heart if any scandal should come upon her husband. She say that she would come down when her husband be asleep at three in the morning, and speak with me through the end window, if I would go away afterwards and leave her in peace. She come down and bring money with her, try to bribe me to go. This make me mad, and I catch her arm and try to pull her through the window. At that moment in rush the husband with his revolver in his hand. Elsie have sink down upon the floor, and we be face to face. I be heel also, and I hold up my gun to scare him off and let me get away. He fire and miss me. I pull off almost at the same instant, and down he drop. I make away across the garden, and a I go I hear the window shut behind me. That's God's truth, gentleman, every word of it, and I hear no more about it until that lad come rid up with a note which make me walk in here, like a jay, and give myself into your hand.\" A cab have drive up whilst the American have be talk. Two uniform policeman sit inside. Inspector Martin rise and touch"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "Suzanne make one of her sympathetic noise again and Sir Eustace proceed in a still more aggrieve tone. \"And, if that's not enough, the fellow who murder her have the impudence, the colossal impudence, to attach himself to me a my secretary. My secretary, if you please! I'm tire of secretary, I won't have any more secretary. Either they're conceal murderer or else they're drunken brawler. Have you see Pagett's black eye? But of course you have. How can I go about with a secretary like that? And his face be such a nasty shade of yellow too--just the color that doesn't go with a black eye. I've do with secretary--unless I have a girl. A nice girl, with liquid eye, who'll hold my hand when I'm feel cross. What about you, Miss Anne. Will you take on the job?\" \"How often shall I have to hold Harry keep him cover with the revolver. \"So you see, Sir Eustace, the game be up. It be you yourself who very kindly provide u with the clue of your whereabouts. Race's men be watch the exit of the secret passage.

If I've lose the trick, so have you. You'll never be able to bring the murder of Nadina home to me. I be in Marlow on that day, that's all you've get against me. No one can prove that I even know the woman. But you know her, you have a motive for kill her--and your record's against you. You're a thief, remember, a thief. There's one thing you don't know, perhaps. _I've get the diamond._ And here go-- With an incredibly swift movement, he stoop, swing up his arm and throw. There be a tinkle of break glass, a the object go through the window and disappear into the blaze mass opposite. \"There go your only hope of establish your innocence over the Kimberley affair. And now we'll talk. I'll drive a bargain with you. You've get me corner. Race will find all he need in this house. There's a chance for me if I can get away. I'm do for if I stay, but so be you, young man! There's a skylight in the next room. A couple of minutes' start and I shall be all right. I've get one or two little arrangement all ready make. You let me out that way, and give me a start--and I leave you a sign confession that I kill Nadina.\" _\"Yes,_ Harry,\" I cry. \"Yes, yes, yes!\" He turn a stern face on me. \"No, Anne, a thousand time, no. You don't know what you're say.\" \"I do. It solve everything.\" \"I'd never be able to look Race in the face again. I'll take my chance, but I'm damn if I'll let this slippery old fox get away. It's no good, Anne. I won't do it.\" Sir Eustace chuckle. He accept defeat without the least emotion. \"Well, well,\" he remark. \"You seem to have meet your master, Anne. But I can assure you both that moral rectitude do not always pay.\" There be a crash of rend wood, and footstep surge up the stair. Harry draw back the bolt. Colonel Race be the first to enter the room. His face light at the sight of u. \"You're safe, Anne. I be afraid-- He turn to Sir Eustace. \"I've be after you for a long time, Pedler--and at last I've get you.\" \"Everybody seem to have go completely mad,\" declare Sir Eustace airily. \"These young people have be threaten me with revolver and accuse me of the most shock thing. I don't know what it's all about.\" \"Don't you? It mean that I've find the 'Colonel.' It mean that on January 8th last you be not at Cannes, but at Marlow. It mean that when your tool, Madame Nadina, turn against you, you plan to do away with her--and at last we shall be able to bring the crime home to you.\" \"Indeed? And from whom do you get all this interest information? From the man who be even now be look for by the police? His evidence will be very valuable.\" \"We have other evidence. There be some one else who know that Nadina be go to meet you at the Mill House.\" Sir Eustace look surprise. Colonel Race make a gesture with his hand. Arthur Mink _alias_ the Rev. Edward Chichester _alias_ Miss Pettigrew step forward. He be pale and nervous, but he speak clearly enough: \"I saw Nadina in Paris the night before she go over to England. I be pose at the time a a Russian Count. She tell me of her purpose. I warn her, know what kind of man she have to deal with, but she do not take my advice. There be a wireless message on the table. I read it. Afterwards I think I would have a try for the diamond myself. In Johannesburg, Mr. Rayburn accost me. He persuade me to come over to his side.\" Sir Eustace look at him. He say nothing, but Mink seem visibly to wilt. \"Rat always leave a sink ship,\" observe Sir Eustace. \"I don't care for rat. Sooner or later, I destroy vermin.\" \"There's just one thing I'd like to tell you, Sir Eustace,\" I remark. \"That tin you throw out of the window didn't contain the diamond. It have common pebble in it. The diamond be in a perfectly safe place. A a matter of fact, they're in the big giraffe's stomach. Suzanne hollow it out, put the diamond in with cotton wool, so that they wouldn't rattle, and plug it up again.\" Sir Eustace look at me for some time. His reply be characteristic: \"I always do hate that blink giraffe,\" he say. \"It must have be instinct.\" We be not able to return to Johannesburg that night. The shell be come over pretty fast, and I gather that we be now more or le cut off, owe to the rebel have obtain possession of a new part of the suburb. Our place of refuge be a farm some twenty mile or so from Johannesburg--right out on the veld. I be drop with fatigue. All the excitement and anxiety of the last two day have leave me little better than a limp rag. I keep repeat to myself, without be able to believe it, that our trouble be really over. Harry and I be together and we should never be separate again. Yet all through I be conscious of some barrier between u--a constraint on his part, the reason of which I could not fathom. Sir Eustace have be drive off in an opposite direction accompany by a strong guard. He wave his hand airily to u on depart. I come out on to the _stoep_ early on the follow morning and look across the veld in the direction of Johannesburg. I could see the great dump glisten in the pale morning sunshine, and I could hear the low rumble mutter of the gun. The Revolution be not over yet. The farmer's wife come out and call me in to breakfast. She be a kind, motherly soul, and I be already very fond of her. Harry have go out at dawn and have not yet return, so she inform me. Again I felt a stir of uneasiness pas over me. What be this shadow of which I be so conscious between u? After breakfast I sit out on the _stoep_, a book in my hand which I do not read. I be so lose in my own thought that I never saw Colonel Race ride up and dismount from his horse. It be not until he say \"Good morning, Anne,\" that I become aware of his presence. \"Oh,\" I say, with a flush, \"it's you.\" \"Yes. May I sit down?\" He draw a chair up beside me. It be the first time we have be alone together since that day at the Matoppos. A always, I felt that curious mixture of fascination and fear that he never fail to inspire in me. \"What be the news?\" I ask. \"Smut will be in Johannesburg to-morrow. I give this"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "Our tiny local library suddenly make up it mind to have an assistant librarian. Finally, the doctor call upon me, and after make various ridiculous excuse for fail to send in a proper bill, he hum and haw a good deal and suddenly suggest that I should marry him. I be very much astonish. The doctor be nearer forty than thirty, and a round, tubby little man. He be not at all like the hero of \"The Peril of Pamela,\" and even le like a stern and silent Rhodesian. I reflect a minute and then ask him why he want to marry me. That seem to fluster him a good deal, and he murmur that a wife be a great help to a General Practitioner. The position seem even more unromantic than before, and yet something in me urge towards it acceptance. Safety, that be what I be be offer. Safety--and a Comfortable Home. Think it over now, I believe I do the little man an injustice. He be honestly in love with me, but a mistake delicacy prevent him from press his suit on those line. Anyway, my love of romance rebel. \"It's extremely kind of you,\" I say. \"But it's impossible. I could never marry a man unless I love him madly.\" \"You don't think----?\" \"No, I don't,\" I say firmly. He sigh. \"But, my dear child, what do you propose to do?\" \"Have adventure and see the world,\" I reply, without the least hesitation. \"Miss Anne, you be very much of a child still. You don't understand-- \"The practical difficulty? Yes, I do, doctor. I'm not a sentimental schoolgirl--I'm a hard-head mercenary shrew! You'd know it if you marry me!\" \"I wish you would reconsider-- \"I can't.\" He sigh again. \"I have another proposal to make. An aunt of mine who live in Wale be in want of a young lady to help her. How would that suit you?\" \"No, doctor, I'm go to London. If thing happen anywhere, they happen in London. I shall keep my eye open and you'll see, something will turn up! You'll hear of me next in China or Timbuctoo.\" My next visitor be Mr. Flemming, Papa's London solicitor. He come down specially from town to see me. An ardent anthropologist himself, he be a great admirer of Papa's work. He be a tall, spare man with a thin face and gray hair. He rise to meet me a I enter the room and, take both my hand in his, pat them affectionately. \"My poor child,\" he say. \"My poor, poor child.\" Without conscious hypocrisy, I find myself assume the demeanor of a bereave orphan. He hypnotize me into it. He be benignant, kind and fatherly--and without the least doubt he regard me a a perfect fool of a girl leave adrift to face an unkind world. From the first I felt that it be quite useless to try to convince him of the contrary. A thing turn out, perhaps it be just a well I didn't. \"My dear child, do you think you can listen to me whilst I try to make a few thing clear to you?\" \"Oh, yes.\" \"Your father, a you know, be a very great man. Posterity will appreciate him. But he be not a good man of business.\" I know that quite a well, if not better than Mr. Flemming, but I restrain myself from say so. He continue: \"I do not suppose you understand much of these matter. I will try to explain a clearly a I can.\" He explain at unnecessary length. The upshot seem to be that I be leave to face life with the sum of PS87, 17. 4d. It seem a strangely unsatisfying amount. I wait in some trepidation for what be come next. I fear that Mr. Flemming would be sure to have an aunt in Scotland who be in want of a bright young companion. Apparently, however, he hadn't. \"The question be,\" he go on, \"the future. I understand you have no live relative?\" \"I'm alone in the world,\" I say, and be strike anew by my liken to a film heroine. \"You have friend?\" \"Every one have be very kind to me,\" I say gratefully. \"Who would not be kind to one so young and charm?\" say Mr. Flemming gallantly. \"Well, well, my dear, we must see what can be do.\" He hesitate a minute, and then say: \"Suppose--how would it be if you come to u for a time?\" I jump at the chance. London! The place for thing to happen. \"It's awfully kind of you,\" I say. \"Might I really? Just while I'm look round. I must start out to earn my live, you know?\" \"Yes, yes, my dear child. I quite understand. We will look round for something--suitable.\" I felt instinctively that Mr. Flemming's idea of \"something suitable\" and mine be likely to be widely divergent, but it be certainly not the moment I ring the bell, and a smile Kafir boy answer it. \"Mr. Raffini?\" I inquire. He usher me in, precede me down the passage and fling open a door. Just a I be about to pas in, I hesitate. I felt a sudden misgive. I step over the threshold and the door swing sharply to behind me. A man rise from his seat behind a table and come forward with outstretched hand. \"So glad we have persuade you to visit u, Miss Beddingfeld,\" he say. He be a tall man, obviously a Dutchman, with a flame orange beard. He do not look in the least like the curator of a museum. In fact, I realize in a flash that I have make a fool of myself. I be in the hand of the enemy. It remind me forcibly of Episode III in \"The Peril of Pamela.\" How often have I not sit in the sixpenny seat, eat a twopenny bar of milk chocolate, and yearn for similar thing to happen to me. Well, they have happen with a vengeance. And somehow it be not nearly so amuse a I have imagine. It's all very well on the screen--you have the comfortable knowledge that there's bind to be an Episode IV. But in real life there be absolutely no guarantee that Anna the Adventure might not terminate abruptly at the end of any Episode. Yes, I be in a tight place. All the thing that Rayburn have say that morning come back to me with unpleasant distinctness. Tell the truth, he have say. Well, I could always do that, but be it go to help me? To begin with, would my story be believe? Would they consider it likely or possible that I have start off on this mad escapade simply on the strength of a scrap of paper smell of moth ball? It sound to me a wildly incredible tale. In that moment of cold sanity I curse myself for a melodramatic idiot, and yearn for the peaceful boredom of Little Hampsly. All this pas through my mind in le time than it take to tell. My first instinctive movement be to step backwards and feel for the handle of the door. My captor merely grin. \"Here you be and here you stay,\" he remark facetiously. I do my best to put a bold face upon the matter. \"I be invite to come here by the curator of the Cape Town Museum. If I have make a mistake-- \"A mistake? Oh, yes, a big mistake!\" He laugh coarsely. \"What right have you to detain me? I shall inform the police-- \"Yap, yap, yap--like a little toy dog.\" He laugh. I sit down on a chair. \"I can only conclude that you be a dangerous lunatic,\" I say coldly. \"Indeed?\" \"I should like to point out to you that my friend be perfectly well aware where I have go, and that if I have not return by this even, they will come in search of me. You understand?\" \"So your friend know where you be, do they? Which of them?\" Thus challenge, I do a lightning calculation of chance. Should I mention Sir Eustace? He be a well-know man, and his name might carry weight. But if they be in touch with Pagett, they might know I be lie. Better not risk Sir Eustace"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "He be just white with rage, and those light eye of his be blaze with fury. What be I do with the lady? How dare I offer her attention which be distasteful to her? Do I think that because I be a baronet I could do what I like? If he have not be her brother I should have know better how to answer him. A it be I tell him that my feel towards his sister be such a I be not ashamed of, and that I hop that she might honor me by become my wife. That seem to make the matter no better, so then I lose my temper too, and I answer him rather more hotly than I should perhaps, consider that she be stand by. So it end by his go off with her, a you saw, and here be I a badly puzzle a man a any in this county. Just tell me what it all mean, Watson, and I'll owe you more than ever I can hope to pay.\" I try one or two explanation, but, indeed, I be completely puzzle myself. Our friend's title, his fortune, his age, his character, and his appearance be all in his favor, and I know nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which run in his family. That his advance should be reject so brusquely without any reference to the lady's own wish and that the lady should accept the situation without protest be very amaze. However, our conjecture be set at rest by a visit from Stapleton himself that very afternoon. He have come to offer apology for his rudeness of the morning, and after a long private interview with Sir Henry in his study the upshot of their conversation be that the breach be quite heal, and that we be to dine at Merripit House next Friday a a sign of it. \"I don't say now that he isn't a crazy man,\" say Sir Henry; \"I can't forget the look in his eye when he run at me this morning, but I must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he have do.\" \"Do he give any explanation of his conduct?\" \"His sister be everything in his life, he say. That be natural enough, and I be glad that he should understand her value. They have always be together, and accord to his account he have be a very lonely man with only her a a companion, so that the think of lose her be really terrible to him. He have not understand, he say, that I be become attach to her, but when he saw with his own eye that it be really so, and that she might be take away from him, it give him such a shock that for a time he be not responsible for what he say or do. He be very sorry for all that have pas, and he recognize how foolish and how selfish it be that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life. If she have to leave him he have rather it be to a neighbor like myself than to anyone else. But in any case it be a blow to him and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself to meet it. He would withdraw all opposition upon his part if I would promise for three month to let the matter rest and to be content with cultivate the lady's friendship during that time without claim her love. This I promise, and so the matter rest.\" So there be one of our small mystery clear up. It be something to have touch bottom anywhere in this bog in which we be flounder. We know now why Stapleton look with disfavor upon his sister's suitor--even when that suitor be so eligible a one a Sir Henry. And now I pas on to another thread which I have extricate out of the tangle skein, the mystery of the sob in the night, of the tear-stain face of Mr. I'm not so light to lift a I use to be.\" Gregson and Lestrade exchange glance a if they think this proposition rather a bold one; but Holmes at once take the prisoner at his word, and loosen the towel which we have bind round his ancles. [23] He rise and stretch his leg, a though to assure himself that they be free once more. I remember that I think to myself, a I eye him, that I have seldom see a more powerfully build man; and his dark sunburn face bore an expression of determination and energy which be a formidable a his personal strength. \"If there's a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you be the man for it,\" he say, gaze with undisguised admiration at my fellow-lodger. \"The way you keep on my trail be a caution.\" \"You have better come with me,\" say Holmes to the two detective. \"I can drive you,\" say Lestrade. \"Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have take an interest in the case and may a well stick to u.\" I assent gladly, and we all descend together. Our prisoner make no attempt at escape, but step calmly into the cab which have be his, and we follow him. Lestrade mount the box, whip up the horse, and bring u in a very short time to our destination. We be usher into a small chamber where a police Inspector note down our prisoner's name and the name of the men with whose murder he have be charge. The official be a white-face unemotional man, who go through his duty in a dull mechanical way. \"The prisoner will be put before the magistrate in the course of the week,\" he say; \"in the mean time, Mr. Jefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say? I must warn you that your word will be take down, and may be use against you.\" \"I've get a good deal to say,\" our prisoner say slowly. \"I want to tell you gentleman all about it.\" \"Hadn't you better reserve that for your trial?\" ask the Inspector. \"I may never be try,\" he answer. \"You needn't look startle. It isn't suicide I be think of. Be you a Doctor?\" He turn his fierce dark eye upon me a he ask this last question. \"Yes; I be,\" I answer. \"Then put your hand here,\" he say, with a smile, motion with his manacle wrist towards his chest. I do so; and become at once conscious of an extraordinary throb and commotion which be go on inside. The wall of his chest seem to thrill and quiver a a frail build would do inside when some powerful engine be at work. In the silence of the room I could hear a dull hum and buzz noise which proceed from the same source. \"Why,\" I cry, \"you have an aortic aneurism!\" \"That's what they call it,\" he say, placidly. \"I go to a Doctor last week about it, and he tell me that it be bind to burst before many day pas. It have be get worse for year. I get it from over-exposure and under-feed among the Salt Lake Mountain. I've do my work now, and I don't care how soon I go, but I should like to leave some account of the business behind me. I don't want to be remember a a common cut-throat.\" The Inspector and the two detective have a hurry discussion a to the advisability of allow him to tell his story. \"Do you consider, Doctor, that there be immediate danger?\" the former ask, [24] \"Most certainly there be,\" I answer. \"In that case it be clearly our duty, in the interest of justice, to take his statement,\" say the Inspector. \"You be at liberty, sir, to give your account, which I again warn you will be take down.\" \"I'll sit down, with your leave,\" the prisoner say, suit the action to the word. \"This aneurism of mine make me easily tire, and the tussle we have half an hour ago have not mend matter.

I step along to investigate, but, at my advance, the brown bush withdraw itself precipitately, and face me with a finger to it lip. It be Giraud. Enjoin caution, he lead the way round the shed until we be out of ear-shoot. \"What be you do there?\" I ask. \"Exactly what you be do--listen.\" \"But I be not there on purpose!\" \"Ah!\" say Giraud. \"I be.\" A always, I admire the man whilst dislike him. He look me up and down with a sort of contemptuous disfavor. \"You didn't help matter by butt in. I might have hear something useful in a minute. What have you do with your old fossil?\" \"M. Poirot have go to Paris,\" I reply coldly. \"And I can tell you, M. Giraud, that he be anything but an old fossil. He have solve many case that have completely baffle the English police.\" \"Bah! The English police!\" Giraud snap his finger disdainfully. \"They must be on a level with our examine magistrate. So he have go to Paris, have he? Well, a good thing. The longer he stay there, the better. But what do he think he will find there?\" I think I read in the question a tinge of uneasiness. I draw myself up. \"That I be not at liberty to say,\" I say quietly. Giraud subject me to a pierce stare. \"He have probably enough sense not to tell _you___,\" he remark rudely. \"Good afternoon. I'm busy.\" And with that, he turn on his heel, and leave me without ceremony. Matter seem at a standstill at the Villa Genevieve. Giraud evidently do not desire my company and, from what I have see, it seem fairly certain that Jack Renauld do not either. I go back to the town, have an enjoyable bath and return to the hotel. I turn in early, wonder whether the follow day would bring forth anything of interest. I be wholly unprepared for what it do bring forth. I be eat my petit dejeuner in the din-room, when the waiter, who have be talk to some one outside, come back in obvious excitement. He hesitate for a minute, fidget with his napkin, and then burst out. \"Monsieur will pardon me, but he be connect, be he not, with the affair at the Villa Genevieve?' \"Yes,\" I say eagerly. \"Why?\" \"Monsieur have not hear the news, though?\" \"What news?\" \"That there have be another murder there last night!\" \"_What?___\" Leave my breakfast, I catch up my hat and run a fast a I could. Another murder--and Poirot away! What fatality. But who have be murder? I dash in at the gate. A group of the servant be in the drive, talk and gesticulate. I catch hold of Francoise. \"What have happen?\" \"Oh, monsieur! monsieur! Another death! It be terrible. There be a curse upon the house. But yes, I say it, a curse! They should send for M. le cure to bring some holy water. Never will I sleep another night under that roof. It might be my turn, who know?\" She cross herself. \"Yes,\" I cry, \"but who have be kill?\" \"Do I know--me? A man--a stranger. They find him up there--in the shed--not a hundred yard from where they find poor Monsieur. And that be not all. He be stab--stab to the heart _with the same dagger!___\" Wait for no more, I turn and run up the path to the shed. The two men on guard there stand aside to let me pas and, fill with excitement, I enter. The light be dim, the place be a mere rough wooden erection to keep old pot and tool in. I have enter impetuously, but on the threshold I check myself, fascinate by the spectacle before me. Giraud be on his hand and knee, a pocket torch in his hand with which he be examine every inch of the grind. He look up with a frown at my entrance, then his face relax a little in a sort of good-humor contempt. \"Ah, _c'est l'anglais!___ Enter then. Let u see what you can make of this affair.\" Rather sting by his tone, I stoop my head, and pas in. \"There he be,\" say Giraud, flash his torch to the far corner. I step across. The dead man lay straight upon his back. He be of medium height, swarthy of complexion, and possibly about fifty year of age. He be neatly dress in a dark blue suit, well cut and probably make by an expensive tailor, but not new. His face be terribly convulse, and on his leave side, just over the heart, the hilt of a dagger stand up, black and shin. I recognize it. It be the same dagger I have see repose in the glass jar the precede morning! \"I'm expect the doctor any minute,\" explain Giraud. \"Although we hardly need him. There's no doubt what the man die of. He be stab to the heart, and death must have be pretty well instantaneous.\" \"When be it do? Last night?\" Giraud shake his head. \"Hardly. I don't lay down the law on medical evidence, but the man's be dead well over twelve hour. When do you say you last saw that dagger?\" \"About ten o'clock yesterday morning.\" \"Then I should be incline to fix the crime a be do not long after that.\" \"But people be pas and repassing this shed continually.\" Giraud laugh disagreeably. \"You progress to a marvel! Who tell you he be kill in this shed?\" \"Well I felt fluster. \"I--I assume it.\" \"Oh, what a fine detective! Look at him, _mon petit___--do a man stab to the heart fall like that--neatly with his foot together, and his arm to his side? No. Again do a man lie down on his back and permit himself to be stab without raise a hand to defend himself? It be absurd, be it not? But see here--and here He flash the torch along the grind. I saw curious irregular mark in the soft dirt. \"He be drag here after he be dead. Half drag, half carry by two people. Their track do not show on the hard grind outside, and here they have be careful to obliterate them--but one of the two be a woman, my young friend.\" \"A woman?\" \"Yes.\" \"But if the track be obliterate, how do you know?\" \"Because, blur a they be, the print of the woman's shoe be unmistakable. Also, by _this___ And, lean forward, he draw something from the handle of the dagger and hold it up for me to see. It be a woman's long black hair--similar to the one Poirot have take from the arm-chair in the library. With a slightly ironic smile he wind it round the dagger again. \"We will leave thing a they be a much a possible,\" he explain. \"It please the examine magistrate. _Eh bien___, do you notice anything else?\" I be force to shake my head. \"Look at his hand.\" I do. The nail be break and discolor, and the skin be hard. It hardly enlighten me a much a I should have like it to have do. I look up at Giraud. \"They be not the hand of a gentleman,\" he say, answer my look. \"On the contrary his clothe be those of a well-to-do man. That be curious, be it not?\" \"Very curious,\" I agree. \"And none of his clothe be mark. What do we learn from that? This man be try to pas himself off a other than he be. He be masquerade. Why? Do he fear something? Be he try to escape by disguise himself? A yet we do not know, but one thing we do know--he be a anxious to conceal his identity a we be to discover it.\" He look down at the body again. \"A before there be no finger-print on the handle of the dagger. The murderer again wear glove.\" \"You think, then, that the murderer be the same in both case?\" I ask eagerly. Giraud become inscrutable. \"Never mind what I think. We shall see.

But our last five minute be undisturbed, and the girl bring out with an effort the request she have try to make all day.  \"Whoever kill my father--and it be murder, Mr. Knox--whoever do it be go free to save a scandal. All my--friend\"--she smile bitterly--\"be afraid of the same thing. But I can not sit quiet and think nothing can be do. I _must_ know, and you be the only one who seem will to try to find out.\"  So it be, that, when I leave the house a half hour later, I be commit. I have be commission by the girl I love--for it have come to that--to clear her lover of her father's murder, and so give him back to her--not in so many word, but I be to follow up the crime, and the rest follow. And I be morally certain of two thing--first, that her lover be not worthy of her, and second, and more to the point, that innocent or guilty, he be indirectly implicate in the crime.  I have promise her also to see Miss Letitia that day if I could, and I turn over the event of the precede night a I walk toward the station, but I make nothing of them. One thing occur to me, however. Bella have tell Margery that I have be up all night. Could Bella--? But I dismiss the think a absurd--Bella, who have scuttle to bed in a panic of fright, would never have dare the lower floor alone, and Bella, give all the courage in the world, could never have move with the swiftness and light certainty of my midnight prowler. It have not be Bella.  But after all I do not go to Bellwood. I meet Hunter on my way to the station, and he turn around and walk with me.  \"So you've lie down on the case!\" I say, when we have go a few step without speak.  He grumble something unintelligible and probably unrepeatable.  \"Of course,\" I persist, \"be a simple and uncomplicated case of suicide, there be nothing in it anyhow. If it have be a murder, under peculiar circumstance--\"  He stop and grip my arm.  \"For ten cent,\" he say gravely, \"I would tell the chief and a few others what I think of them. And then I'd go out and get full.\"  \"Not on ten cent!\"  \"I'm go out of the business,\" he storm. \"I'm go to drive a garbage waggon: it's cleaner than this job. Suicide! I never saw a cleaner case of--\" He stop suddenly. \"Do you know Burton--of the _Time-Post_?\"  \"No: I've hear of him.\"  \"Well, he's your man. They're dead against the ring, and Burton's be give the case. He's a sharp a a steel trap. You two get together.\"  He pause at a corner. \"Good-by,\" he say dejectedly. \"I'm off to hunt some boy that have be steal milk bottle. That's about my size, these day.\" He turn around, however, before he have go many step and come back.  \"Wardrop have be miss since yesterday afternoon,\" he say. \"That be, he think he's miss. We've get him all right.\"  I give up my Bellwood visit for the time, and take a car down-town, I go to the _Time-Post_ office. The Monday morning edition be already under way, a far a the staff be concern, and from the wait-room I could see three or four men, with their hat on, most of them rattle typewriter. Burton come in in a moment, a red-haired young fellow, with a short thick nose and a muggy skin. He be rather stocky in build, and the pugnacity of his feature do not hide the shrewdness of his eye.  I introduce myself, and at my name his perfunctory manner change.  \"Knox!\" he say. \"I call you last night over the 'phone.\"  \"Can't we talk in a more private place?\" I ask, try to raise my voice above the confusion of the next room. In reply he take me into a tiny office, contain a desk and two chair, and separate by an eight-foot partition from the other room.  \"This be the best we have,\" he explain cheerfully. \"Newspaper be agent of publicity, not privacy--if you don't care what you say.\"  I like Burton. There be something genuine about him; after Wardrop's kid-glove finish, he be a relief.  \"Hunter, of the detective bureau, send me here,\" I proceed, \"about the Fleming case.\"  He take out his note-book. \"You be the fourth to-day,\" he say. \"Hunter himself, Lightfoot from Plattsburg, and Mcfeely here in town. Well, Mr. Knox, be you will now to put yourself on record that Fleming commit suicide?\"  \"No,\" I say firmly. \"It be my belief that he be murder.\"  \"And that the secretary fellow, what's his name?--Wardrop?--that he kill him?\"  \"Possibly.\"  In reply Burton fumble in his pocket and bring up a pasteboard box, fill with jeweller's cotton. Underneath be a small object, which he pas to me with care.  \"I get it from the coroner's physician, who perform the autopsy,\" he say casually. \"You will notice that it be a thirty-two, and that the revolver they take from Wardrop be a thirty-eight. Question, where's the other gun?\"  I give him back the bullet, and he roll it around on the palm of his hand.  \"Little thing, isn't it?\" he say. \"We think we're lord of creation, until we see a quarter-inch bichloride tablet, or a bite of lead like this. Look here.\" He dive into his pocket again and draw out a roll of ordinary brown paper. When he open it a bite of white chalk fell on the desk.  \"Look at that,\" he say dramatically. \"Kill an army with it, and they'd never know what strike them. Cyanide of potassium--and the druggist that sell it ought to be choke.\"  \"Where do it come from?\" I ask curiously. Burton smile his cheerful smile.  \"It's a beautiful case, all around,\" he say, a he get his hat. \"I haven't have any Sunday dinner yet, and it's five o'clock. Oh--the cyanide? Clarkson, the cashier of the bank Fleming ruin, take a bite off that corner right there, this morning.\"  \"Clarkson!\" I exclaim. \"How be he?\"  \"God only know,\" say Burton gravely, from which I take it Clarkson be dead.      Burton listen while he eat, and his cheerful comment be welcome enough after the depression of the last few day. I tell him, after some hesitation, the whole thing, begin with the Maitland pearl and end with my drop down the dumb-waiter. I know I be absolutely safe in do so: there be no person to whom I would rather tell a secret than a newspaper man. He will go out of his way to keep it: he will lock it in the depth of his bosom, and keep it until seventy time seven. Also, you may threaten the rack or offer a larger salary, the seal do not come off his lip until the word be give. If then he make a scarehead of it, and get in three column of space and a many photograph, it be his just reward.  So--I tell Burton everything, and he eat enough beefsteak for two men, and miss not a word I say.  \"The money Wardrop have in the grip--that's easy enough explain,\" he say. \"Fleming use the Borough Bank to deposit state fund in. He must have know it be rotten: he and Clarkson be a thick a thieve. Accord to a time-honour custom in our land of the brave and home of the free, a state treasurer who be crook can, in such a case, draw on such a bank without security, on his personal note, which be usually worth it value by the pound a old"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "He enter it, and his hansom drive away. Give me a glass of water, if you please. My mouth get dry with the talk.\" I hand him the glass, and he drink it down. \"That's better,\" he say. \"Well, I wait for a quarter of an hour, or more, when suddenly there come a noise like people struggle inside the house. Next moment the door be fling open and two men appear, one of whom be Drebber, and the other be a young chap whom I have never see before. This fellow have Drebber by the collar, and when they come to the head of the step he give him a shove and a kick which send him half across the road. 'You hound,' he cry, shake his stick at him; 'I'll teach you to insult an honest girl!' He be so hot that I think he would have thrash Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur stagger away down the road a fast a his leg would carry him. He run a far a the corner, and then, see my cab, he hail me and jump in. 'Drive me to Halliday's Private Hotel,' say he. \"When I have him fairly inside my cab, my heart jump so with joy that I fear lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drive along slowly, weigh in my own mind what it be best to do. I might take him right out into the country, and there in some desert lane have my last interview with him. I have almost decide upon this, when he solve the problem for me. The craze for drink have seize him again, and he order me to pull up outside a gin palace. He go in, leave word that I should wait for him. There he remain until close time, and when he come out he be so far go that I know the game be in my own hand. \"Don't imagine that I intend to kill him in cold blood. It would only have be rigid justice if I have do so, but I could not bring myself to do it. I have long determine that he should have a show for his life if he choose to take advantage of it. Among the many billet which I have fill in America during my wander life, I be once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day the professor be lecture on poisions, [25] and he show his student some alkaloid, a he call it, which he have extract from some South American arrow poison, and which be so powerful that the least grain mean instant death. I spot the bottle in which this preparation be keep, and when they be all go, I help myself to a little of it. I be a fairly good dispenser, so I work this alkaloid into small, soluble pill, and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill make without the poison. I determine at the time that when I have my chance, my gentleman should each have a draw out of one of these box, while I eat the pill that remain. It would be quite a deadly, and a good deal le noisy than fire across a handkerchief. From that day I have always my pill box about with me, and the time have now come when I be to use them. \"It be nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blow hard and rain in torrent. Dismal a it be outside, I be glad within--so glad that I could have shout out from pure exultation. If any of you gentleman have ever pin for a thing, and long for it during twenty long year, and then suddenly find it within your reach, you would understand my feel. I light a cigar, and puff at it to steady my nerve, but my hand be tremble, and my temple throb with excitement. A I drive, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy look at me out of the darkness and smile at me, just a plain a I see you all in this room. All the way they be ahead of me, one on each side of the horse until I pull up at the house in the Brixton Road. \"There be not a soul to be see, nor a sound to be hear, except the drip of the rain. When I look in at the window, I find Drebber all huddle together in a drunken sleep. I shake him by the arm, 'It's time to get out,' I say. \"'All right, cabby,' say he. \"I suppose he think we have come to the hotel that he have mention, for he get out without another word, and follow me down the garden. I have to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he be still a little top-heavy. When we come to the door, I open it, and lead him into the front room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the daughter be walk in front of u. \"'It's infernally dark,' say he, stamp about. \"'We'll soon have a light,' I say, strike a match and put it to a wax candle which I have bring with me. 'Now, Enoch Drebber,' I continue, turn to him, and hold the light to my own face, 'who be I?' \"He gaze at me with blear, drunken eye for a moment, and then I saw a horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole feature, which show me that he know me. He stagger back with a livid face, and I saw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chatter in his head. At the sight, I lean my back against the door and laugh loud and long. I have always know that vengeance would be sweet, but I have never hop for the contentment of soul which now posse me. \"'You dog!' I say; 'I have hunt you from Salt Lake City to St. Petersburg, and you have always escape me. Now, at last your wander have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see to-morrow's sun rise.' He shrink still further away a I speak, and I could see on his face that he think I be mad. So I be for the time. The pulse in my temple beat like sledge-hammer, and I believe I would have have a fit of some sort if the blood have not gush from my nose and relieve me. \"'What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?' I cry, lock the door, and shake the key in his face. 'Punishment have be slow in come, but it have overtake you at last.' I saw his coward lip tremble a I speak. He would have beg for his life, but he know well that it be useless. \"'Would you murder me?' he stammer. \"'there be no murder,' I answer. 'Who talk of murder a mad dog? What mercy have you upon my poor darling, when you drag her from her slaughter father, and bore her away to your accurse and shameless harem.' \"'It be not I who kill her father,' he cry. \"'But it be you who break her innocent heart,' I shriek, thrust the box before him. 'Let the high God judge between u. Choose and eat. There be death in one and life in the other. I shall take what you leave. Let u see if there be justice upon the earth, or if we be rule by chance.' \"He cower away with wild cry and prayer for mercy, but I draw my knife and hold it to his throat until he have obey me. Then I swallow the other, and we stand face one another in silence for a minute or more, wait to see which be to live and which be to die. Shall I ever forget the look which come over his face when the first warn pang tell him that the poison be in his system? I laugh a I saw it, and hold Lucy's marriage ring in front of his eye.

Then the two gentleman pas u, walk, and we follow down Baker Street and along--\" \"I know,\" say Holmes. \"Until we get three-quarter down Regent Street. Then my gentleman throw up the trap, and he cry that I should drive right away to Waterloo Station a hard a I could go. I whip up the mare and we be there under the ten minute.

Only just a he be leave he turn round and he say: 'It might interest you to know that you have be drive Mr. Sherlock Holmes.' That's how I come to know the name.\" \"I see. And you saw no more of him?\" \"Not after he go into the station.\" \"And how would you describe Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\" The cabman scratch his head. \"Well, he wasn't altogether such an easy gentleman to describe. I'd put him at forty year of age, and he be of a middle height, two or three inch shorter than you, sir. He be dress like a toff, and he have a black beard, cut square at the end, and a pale face. I don't know a I could say more than that.\" \"Colour of his eye?\" \"No, I can't say that.\" \"Nothing more that you can remember?\" \"No, sir; nothing.\" \"Well, then, here be your half-sovereign. There's another one wait for you if you can bring any more information. Good-night!\" \"Good-night, sir, and thank you!\" John Clayton depart chuckle, and Holmes turn to me with a shrug of his shoulder and a rueful smile. \"Snap go our third thread, and we end where we begin,\" say he. \"The cunning rascal! He know our number, know that Sir Henry Baskerville have consult me, spot who I be in Regent Street, conjecture that I have get the number of the cab and would lay my hand on the driver, and so send back this audacious message. I tell you, Watson, this time we have get a foeman who be worthy of our steel. I've be checkmate in London. I can only wish you better luck in Devonshire. But I'm not easy in my mind about it.\" \"About what?\" \"About send you. It's an ugly business, Watson, an ugly dangerous business, and the more I see of it the le I like it. Yes, my dear fellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in Baker Street once more.\" Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer be ready upon the appoint day, and we start a arrange for Devonshire. Mr. Sherlock Holmes drive with me to the station and give me his last part injunction and advice. \"I will not bias your mind by suggest theory or suspicion, Watson,\" say he; \"I wish you simply to report fact in the fullest possible manner to me, and you can leave me to do the theorize.\" \"What sort of fact?\" I ask. \"Anything which may seem to have a bear however indirect upon the case, and especially the relation between young Baskerville and his neighbor or any fresh particular concern the death of Sir Charles. I have make some inquiry myself in the last few day, but the result have, I fear, be negative. One thing only appear to be certain, and that be that Mr. Jam Desmond, who be the next heir, be an elderly gentleman of a very amiable disposition, so that this persecution do not arise from him. He be sit, fully dress, in an easy-chair, with a slip of paper which look like a map upon his knee, and his forehead sink forward upon his hand in deep think. I stand dumb with astonishment, watch him from the darkness. A small taper on the edge of the table shed a feeble light which suffice to show me that he be fully dress. Suddenly, a I look, he rise from his chair, and walk over to a bureau at the side, he unlock it and draw out one of the drawer. From this he take a paper, and return to his seat he flatten it out beside the taper on the edge of the table, and begin to study it with minute attention. My indignation at this calm examination of our family document overcome me so far that I take a step forward, and Brunton, look up, saw me stand in the doorway. He spring to his foot, his face turn livid with fear, and he thrust into his breast the chart-like paper which he have be originally study. \"'\"So!\" say I. \"This be how you repay the trust which we have repose in you. You will leave my service to-morrow.\" \"'He bow with the look of a man who be utterly crush, and slink past me without a word. The taper be still on the table, and by it light I glance to see what the paper be which Brunton have take from the bureau. To my surprise it be nothing of any importance at all, but simply a copy of the question and answer in the singular old observance call the Musgrave Ritual. It be a sort of ceremony peculiar to our family, which each Musgrave for century past have go through on his come of age--a thing of private interest, and perhaps of some little importance to the archeologist, like our own blazon and charge, but of no practical use whatever.' \"'We have better come back to the paper afterwards,' say I. \"'If you think it really necessary,' he answer, with some hesitation. 'to continue my statement, however: I relocked the bureau, use the key which Brunton have leave, and I have turn to go when I be surprise to find that the butler have return, and be stand before me. \"'\"Mr. Musgrave, sir,\" he cry, in a voice which be hoarse with emotion, \"I can't bear disgrace, sir. I've always be proud above my station in life, and disgrace would kill me. My blood will be on your head, sir--it will, indeed--if you drive me to despair. If you cannot keep me after what have pas, then for God's sake let me give you notice and leave in a month, a if of my own free will. I could stand that, Mr. Musgrave, but not to be cast out before all the folk that I know so well.\" \"'\"You don't deserve much consideration, Brunton,\" I answer. \"Your conduct have be most infamous. However, a you have be a long time in the family, I have no wish to bring public disgrace upon you. A month, however be too long. Take yourself away in a week, and give what reason you like for go.\" \"'\"Only a week, sir?\" he cry, in a despair voice. \"A fortnight--say at least a fortnight!\" \"'\"A week,\" I repeat, \"and you may consider yourself to have be very leniently deal with.\" \"'He creep away, his face sink upon his breast, like a break man, while I put out the light and return to my room. \"'For two day after this Brunton be most assiduous in his attention to his duty. I make no allusion to what have pas, and wait with some curiosity to see how he would cover his disgrace. On the third morning, however he do not appear, a be his custom, after breakfast to receive my instruction for the day. A I leave the din-room I happen to meet Rachel Howells, the maid. I have tell you that she have only recently recover from an illness, and be look so wretchedly pale and wan that I remonstrate with her for be at work. \"'\"You should be in bed,\" I say. \"Come back to your duty when you be stronger.\" \"'She look at me with so strange an expression that I begin to suspect that her brain be affect. \"'\"I be strong enough, Mr. Musgrave,\" say she. \"'\"We will see what the"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "You do not understand, but I will explain it all to you in good time. Believe me, this journey to Paris be necessary. I shall not be away long. In all probability I shall return tomorrow. I do not propose that you should accompany me. Remain here and keep an eye on Giraud. Also cultivate the society of M. Renauld _fils___. And thirdly, if you wish, endeavor to cut him out with Mademoiselle Marthe. But I fear you will not have great success.\" I do not quite relish the last remark. \"That remind me,\" I say. \"I mean to ask you how you know about those two?\" \"_Mon ami___--I know human nature. Throw together a boy young Renauld and a beautiful girl like Mademoiselle Marthe, and the result be almost inevitable. Then, the quarrel! It be money or a woman and, remember Leonie's description of the lad's anger, I decide on the latter. So I make my guess--and I be right.\" \"And that be why you warn me against set my heart on the lady? You already suspect that she love young Renauld?\" Poirot smile. \"At any rate--_I saw that she have anxious eye.___ That be how always think of Mademoiselle Daubreuil _a the girl with the anxious eye. ...___\" His voice be so grave that it impress me uncomfortably. \"What do you mean by that, Poirot?\" \"I fancy, my friend, that we shall see before very long. But I must start.\" \"You've ocean of time.\" \"Perhaps--perhaps. But I like plenty of leisure at the station. I do not wish to rush, to hurry, to excite myself.\" \"At all event,\" I say, rise, \"I will come and see you off.\" \"You will do nothing of the sort. I forbid it.\" He be so peremptory that I star at him in surprise. He nod emphatically. \"I mean it, _mon ami___. Au revoir! You permit that I embrace you? Ah, no, I forget that it be not the English custom. Une poignee de main, alors.\" I felt rather at a loose end after Poirot have leave me. I stroll down the beach, and watch the bather, without feel energetic enough to join them. I rather fancy that Cinderella might be disport herself amongst them in some wonderful costume, but I saw no sign of her. I stroll aimlessly along the sand towards the further end of the town. It occur to me that, after all, it would only be decent feel on my part to inquire after the girl. And it would save trouble in the end. The matter would then be finish with. There would be no need for me to trouble about her any further. But, if I do not go at all, she might quite possibly come and look me up at the Villa. And that would be annoy in every way. Decidedly it would be better to pay a short call, in the course of which I could make it quite clear that I could do nothing further for her in my capacity of showman. Accordingly I leave the beach, and walk inland. I soon find the Hotel du Phare, a very unpretentious build. It be annoy in the extreme not to know the lady's name and, to save my dignity, I decide to stroll inside and look around. Probably I should find her in the lounge. Merlinville be a small place, you leave your hotel to go to the beach, and you leave the beach to return to the hotel. There be no other attraction. There be a Casino be build, but it be not yet complete. I have walk the length of the beach without see her, therefore she must be in the hotel. I go in. Several people be sit in the tiny lounge, but my quarry be not amongst them. I look into some other room, but there be no sign of her. I wait for some time, till my impatience get the better of me. I take the concierge aside, and slip five franc into his hand. \"I wish to see a lady who be stay here. A young English lady, small and dark. I be not sure of her name.\" The man shake his head, and seem to be suppress a grin. \"There be no such lady a you describe stay here.\" \"She be American possibly,\" I suggest. These fellow be so stupid. But the man continue to shake his head. \"No, monsieur. There be only six or seven English and American lady altogether, and they be all much older than the lady you be seek. It be not here that you will find her, monsieur.\" He be so positive that I felt doubt. \"But the lady tell me she be stay here.\" \"Monsieur must have make a mistake--or it be more likely the lady do, since there have be another gentleman here inquire for her.\" \"What be that you say?\" I cry, surprise. \"But yes, monsieur. A gentleman who describe her just a you have do.\" \"What be he like?\" \"He be a small gentleman, well dress, very neat, very spotless, the mustache very stiff, the head of a peculiar shape, and the eye green.\" Poirot! So that be why he refuse to let me accompany him to the station. The impertinence of it! I would thank him not to meddle in my concern. Do he fancy I need a nurse to look after me? Thank the man, I depart, somewhat at a loss, and still much incense with my meddlesome friend. I regret that he be, for the moment, out of reach. I should have enjoy tell him what I think of his unwarranted interference. Have I not distinctly tell him that I have no intention of see the girl? Decidedly, one's friend can be too zealous! But where be the lady? I set aside my wrath, and try to puzzle it out. Evidently, through inadvertence, she have name the wrong hotel. Then another think strike me. Be it inadvertence? Or have she deliberately withhold her name and give me the wrong address? The more I think about it, the more I felt convince that this last surmise of mine be right. For some reason or other she do not wish to let the acquaintance ripen into friendship. And though half an hour earlier this have be precisely my own view, I do not enjoy have the table turn upon me. The whole affair be profoundly unsatisfactory, and I go up to the Villa Genevieve in a condition of distinct ill humor. I do not go to the house, but go up the path to the little bench by the shed, and sit there moodily enough. I be distract from my thought by the sound of voice close at hand. In a second or two I realize that they come, not from the garden I be in, but from the adjoin garden of the Villa Marguerite, and that they be approach rapidly. A girl's voice be speak, a voice that I recognize a that of the beautiful Marthe. \"_Cheri___,\" she be say, \"be it really true? Be all our trouble over.\" \"You know it, Marthe,\" Jack Renauld reply. \"Nothing can part u now, beloved. The last obstacle to our union be remove. Nothing can take you from me.\" \"Nothing?\" the girl murmur. \"Oh, Jack, Jack--I be afraid.\" I have move to depart, realize that I be quite unintentionally eavesdrop. A I rise to my foot, I catch sight of them through a gap in the hedge. They stand together face me, the man's arm round the girl, his eye look into hers. They be a splendid look couple, the dark, well-knit boy, and the fair young goddess. They seem make for each other a they stand there, happy in spite of the terrible tragedy that overshadow their young live. But the girl's face be trouble, and Jack Renauld seem to recognize it, a he hold her closer to him and ask: \"But what be you afraid of, darling? What be there to fear--now?\" And then I saw the look in her eye, the look Poirot have speak of, a she murmur, so that I almost guess at the word. \"I be afraid--for _you___. ...\" I do not hear young Renauld's answer, for my attention be distract by an unusual appearance a little further"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "Miss Jane, through long practise, and because she only skim the surface of conversation, take her cerebral flight easily, but I be more unwieldy of mind.  Nor be Miss Letitia's dominance wholly conversational. Her sister Jane be her creature, alternately snub and bully. To Miss Letitia, Jane, in spite of her sixty-five year, be still a child, and sometimes a bad one. Indeed, many a child of ten be more sophisticate. Miss Letitia give her expurgate book to read, and forbid her to read divorce court proceed in the newspaper. Once, a recreant housemaid present the establishment with a healthy male infant, Jane be send to the country for a month, and be only bring back when the house have be fumigate throughout.  Poor Miss Jane! She meet me with flutter cordiality in the hall that night, safe in be herself for once, with the knowledge that Miss Letitia always receive me from a throne-like horsehair sofa in the back parlour. She wear a new lace cap, and be twitteringly excite.  \"Our niece be here,\" she explain, a I take off my coat--everything be \"ours\" with Jane; \"mine\" with Letitia--\"and we be have an ice at dinner. Please say that ice be not injurious, Mr. Knox. My sister be so oppose to them and I have to beg for this.\"  \"On the contrary, the doctor have order ice for my young nephew,\" I say gravely, \"and I dote on them myself.\"  Miss Jane beam. Indeed, there be something almost unnaturally gay about the little old lady all that even. Perhaps it be the new lace cap. Later, I try to analyse her manner, to recall exactly what she have say, to remember anything that could possibly help. But I could find no clue to what follow.  Miss Letitia receive me a usual, in the back parlour. Miss Fleming be there also, sew by a window, and in her straight white dress with her hair draw back and braid around her head, she look even younger than before. There be no time for conversation. Miss Letitia launch at once into the extravagance of both molasses and butter on the colour orphans' bread and after a glance at me, and a quick comprehension from my face that I have no news for her, the girl at the window bend over her sew again.  \"Molasses breed worm,\" Miss Letitia say decisively. \"So do pork. And yet those child think Heaven mean ham and molasses three time a day.\"  \"You have have no news at all?\" Miss Fleming say cautiously, her head bend over her work.  \"None,\" I return, under cover of the table linen to which Miss Letitia's mind have veer. \"I have a good man work on it.\" A she glance at me questioningly, \"It need a detective, Miss Fleming.\" Evidently another day without news have lessen her distrust of the police, for she nod acquiescence and go on with her sew. Miss Letitia's monotonous monologue go on, and I give it such attention a I might. For the lamp have be light, and with every movement of the girl across, I could see the gleam of a diamond on her engagement finger.  \"If I didn't watch her, Jane would ruin them,\" say Miss Letitia. \"She give 'em apple when they keep their face clean, and the bill for soap have go up double. Soap once a day's enough for a colour child. Do you smell anything burn, Knox?\"  I sniff and lie, whereupon Miss Letitia sweep her black silk, her colour orphan and her majestic presence out of the room. A the door close, Miss Fleming put down her sew and rise. For the first time I saw how weary she look.  \"I do not dare to tell them, Mr. Knox,\" she say. \"They be old, and they hate him anyhow. I couldn't sleep last night. Suppose he should have go back, and find the house close!\"  \"He would telephone here at once, wouldn't he?\" I suggest.  \"I suppose so, yes.\" She take up her sew from the chair with a sigh. \"But I'm afraid he won't come--not soon. I have hem tea towel for Aunt Letitia to-day until I be frantic, and all day I have be wonder over something you say yesterday. You say, you remember, that you be not a detective, that some men could take nineteen from thirty-five and leave nothing. What do you mean?\"  I be speechless for a moment.  \"The fact be--I--you see,\" I blunder, \"it be a--merely a figure of speech, a--speech of figure be more accurate,--\" And then dinner be announce and I be save. But although she say little or nothing during the meal, I catch her look across at me once or twice in a bewilder, puzzle fashion. I could fairly see her revolve my detestable figure in her mind.  Miss Letitia preside over the table in garrulous majesty. The two old lady pick at their food, and Miss Jane have a spot of pink in each wither cheek. Margery Fleming make a brave pretence, but leave her plate almost untouched. A for me, I eat a substantial masculine meal and half apologise for my appetite, but Letitia do not hear. She tear the board of manager to shred with the roast, and denounce them with the salad. But Jane be all anxious hospitality.  \"Please _do_ eat your dinner,\" she whisper. \"I make the salad myself. And I know what it take to keep a big man go. Harry eat more than Letitia and I together. Doesn't he, Margery?\"  \"Harry?\" I ask.  \"Mr. Stevens be an unmitigated fool. I say if they elect her president I'd not leave a penny to the home. That's why I send for you, Knox.\" And to the maid, \"Tell Heppie to wash those cup in luke-warm water. They're the best one. And not to drink her coffee out of them. She let her teeth slip and bite a piece out of one the last time.\"  Miss Jane lean forward to me after a smile glance at her niece across.  \"Harry Wardrop, a cousin's son, and--\" she pat Margery's hand with it ring--\"soon to be something closer.\"  The girl's face colour, but she return Miss Jane's gentle pressure.  \"They put up an iron fence,\" Miss Letitia revert somberly to her grievance, \"when a wooden one would have do. It be extravagance, ruinous extravagance.\"  \"Harry stay with u when he be in Manchester,\" Miss Jane go on, nod brightly across at Letitia a if she, too, be damn the executive board. \"Lately, he have be almost all the time in Plattsburg. He be secretary to Margery's father. It be a position of considerable responsibility, and we be very proud of him.\"  I have expect something of the sort, but the remainder of the meal have somehow lose it savour. There be a lull in the conversation while dessert be be bring in. Miss Jane sit quiver, watch her sister's face for sign of trouble; the latter have subside into mutter grumble, and Miss Fleming sit, one hand on the table, star absently at her engagement ring.  \"You look like a fool in that cap, Jane,\" volunteer Letitia, while the plat be be bring in. \"What's for dessert?\"  \"Ice-cream,\" call Miss Jane, over the table.  \"Well, you needn't,\" snap Letitia, \"I can hear you well enough. You tell me it be junket.\"  \"I say ice-cream, and you say it would be all right,\" poor Jane shriek. \"If you drink a cup of hot water after it, it won't hurt you.\"  \"Fiddle,\" Letitia snap unpleasantly. \"I'm not go to freeze my stomach and then thaw it out like a drain pipe. Tell Heppie to put my ice-cream on the stave.\"  So we wait until Miss Letitia's have be heat, and be bring in, sicklied over with pale hue, not of think, but of confectioners' dye. Miss Letitia eat it resignedly. \"Like a not I'll break out, I do the last time,\" she say gloomily. \"I only hope I don't break out in colour.\"  The meal be over finally, but if I have hop for another word alone with Margery Fleming that even, I be foredoom to disappointment. Letitia send the girl, not ungently, to bed, and order Jane out of the room with"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "She turn, at my voice, and call me to join her where she stand.  \"We be back again, Leslie.\"  \"Yes, Miss Lee.\"  \"Back to--what?  To live the whole thing over again in a courtroom! If only we could go away, anywhere, and try to forget!\"  She have not expect any answer, and I have none ready.  I be think--Heaven help me--that there be thing I would not forget if I could: the lift of her lash a she look, up at me; the few word we have have together, the day she have tell me the deck be not clean; the night I have touch her hand with my lip.  \"We be to be release, I believe,\" she say, \"on our own--some legal term; I forget it.\"  \"Recognizance, probably.\"  \"Yes.  You do not know law a well a medicine?\"  \"I be sorry--no; and I know very little medicine.\"  \"But you sew up a wind!\"  \"A a matter of fact,\" I admit, \"that be my initial performance, and it be badly do.  It--it pucker.\"  She turn on me a trifle impatiently.  \"Why do you make such a secret of your identity?\" she demand. \"Be it a pose? Or--have you a reason for conceal it?\"  \"It be not a pose; and I have nothing to be ashamed of, unless poverty--\"  \"Of course not.  What do you mean by poverty?\"  \"The common garden variety sort.  I have hardly a dollar in the world. A to my identity,--if it interest you at all, I graduate in medicine last June.  I spend the last of the money that be to educate me in purchase a dress suit to graduate in, and a supper by way of celebration.  The dress suit help me to my diploma.  The supper give me typhoid.\"  \"So that be it!\"  \"Not gaol, you see.\"  \"And what be you go to do now?\"  I glance around to where a police officer stand behind u watchfully.  \"Now?  Why, now I go to gaol in earnest.\"  \"You have be very good to u,\" she say wistfully.  \"We have all be strain and nervous.  Maybe you have not think I notice or--or appreciate what you be do; but I have, always.  You have give all of yourself for u.  You have not sleep or eat.  And now you be go to be imprison.  It isn't just!\"  I try to speak lightly, to reassure her.  \"Don't be unhappy about that,\" I say.  \"A nice, safe gaol, where one may sleep and eat, and eat and sleep--oh, I shall be very comfortable! And if you wish to make me exceedingly happy, you will see that they let me have a razor.\"  But, to my surprise, she bury her face in her arm.  I could not believe at first that she be cry.  The policeman have wander across to the other rail, and stand look out at the city light, his back to u.  I put my hand out to touch her soft hair, then draw it back.  I could not take advantage of her sympathy, of the hysterical excitement of that last night on the Ella.  I put my hand in my pocket, and hold them there, clench, lest, in spite of my will, I reach out to take her in my arm.      And now I come, with some hesitation, to the trial.  Hesitation, because I rely on Mcwhirter to keep a record.  And Mcwhirter, from his note, appear to have be carry away at time by excitement, and either jot down row of unintelligible word, or wait until even and make up his note, like a woman's expense account, from a memory never noticeable for accuracy.  At dawn, the morning after we anchor, Charlie Jones rouse me, grin.  \"Friend of yours over the rail, Leslie,\" he say.  \"Want to take you ashore!\"  I know no one in Philadelphia except the chap who have take me yacht once, and I felt pretty certain that he would not associate Leslie the football player with Leslie the sailor on the Ella.  I go reluctantly to the rail, and look down.  Below me, just visible in the river mist of the early morning, be a small boat from which two men be look up.  One be Mcwhirter!  \"Hello, old top,\" he cry.   \"Or be it you behind that beard?\"  \"It's I, all right, Mac,\" I say, somewhat huskily.  What with see him again, his kindly face behind it glass, the cheerful faith in me which be his contribution to our friendship,--even the way he shake his own hand in default of mine,--my throat tighten.  Here, after all, be home and a friend.  He look up at the rail, and motion to a rope that hang there.  \"Get your stuff and come with u for breakfast,\" he say.  \"You look a if you hadn't eat since you leave.\"  \"I'm afraid I can't, Mac.\"  \"They're not go to hold you, be they?\"  \"For a day or so, yes.\"  Mac's reply to this be a violent resume of the ancestry and present lose condition of the Philadelphia police, end with a request that I jump over, and let them go to the place he have just designate a their abide-place in eternity.  On an officer lounge to the rail and look down, however, he subside into a low mutter.  The storey of how Mcwhirter happen to be float on the bosom of the Delaware River before five o'clock in the morning be a long one--it be month before I get it in full.  Briefly, go home from the theatre in New York the night before, he have buy an \"extra\" which have contain a brief account of the Ella's return.  He seem to have go into a frenzy of excitement at once.  He borrow a small car,--one scornfully designate a a \"road louse,\"--and assemble in it, in wild confusion, one suit of clothe for me, his own and much too small, one hypodermic case, an armful of newspaper with red scare-head, a bottle of brandy, a bottle of digitalis, one police card, and one excite young lawyer, of the same vintage in law that Mac and I be in medicine.  At the last moment, fearful that the police might not know who I be, he have fling in a scrapbook in which he have paste--with a glue that be to make his fortune--record of my exploit on the football field!  A dozen mile from Philadelphia the little machine have turn over on a curve, knock all the law and most of the enthusiasm out of Walter, the legal gentleman, and smash the brandy-bottle. Mcwhirter have pick himself up, kick viciously at the car, and, gather up his impedimenta, have make the rest of the journey by foot and street-car.  His wrath at find me a prisoner be unbounded; his scorn at Walter, the attorney, for not confound the police with law enough to free me, be furious and contemptuous.  He pick up the oar in sullen silence, and, lean on them, call a loud and defiant farewell for the benefit of the officer.  \"All right,\" he say.  \"An hour or so won't make much difference. But you'll be free today, all right, all right.  And don't let them bluff you, boy.  If the police get funny, tackle them and throw 'em overboard, one by one.  You can do it.\"  He make an insult gesture at the police, pick up his oar, and row away into the mist.  But I be not free, that day, nor for many day.  A I have expect, Turner, his family, Mr. John, and the stewardess be release, after examination.  The rest of u be take to gaol.  Singleton a a suspect, the others to make sure of their presence at the trial.  The murder take place on the morning of August 12.  The Grand jury meet late in September, and find an indictment against Singleton. The trial begin on the 16th of November.  The confinement be terrible.  Accustom to regular exercise a I be, I suffer mentally and physically. I have take dinner at Bellwood before, and the memory be not hilarious. Miss Letitia be deaf, but choose to ignore the fact. With superb indifference she would break into the conversation with some wholly alien remark that necessitate"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "Mr. Howell bend over him and felt the fourth.  \"Poor little beast!\" he say. \"His leg be break!\"  He make a splint for the dog, and with Lida help, they put him to bed in a clothe-basket in my up-stair kitchen. It be easy to see how thing lay with Mr. Howell. He be all eye for her: he make excuse to touch her hand or her arm--little caress touch that make her colour heighten. And with it all, there be a sort of hopelessness in his manner, a if he know how far the girl be out of his reach. Know Alma and her pride, I know better than they how hopeless it be.  I be not so sure about Lida. I wonder if she be in love with the boy, or only in love with love. She be very young, a I have be. God help her, if, like me, she sacrifice everything, to discover, too late, that she be only in love with love!      Mr. Reynolds do not come home to dinner after all. The water have get into the basement at the store, he telephone, one of the flood-gate in a sewer have leak, and they be move some of the department to an upper floor. I have expect to have him in the house that even, and now I be leave alone again.  But, a it happen, I be not alone. Mr. Grave, one of the city detective, come at half past six, and go carefully over the Ladleys' room. I show him the towel and the slipper and the break knife, and where we have find the knife-blade. He be very non-committal, and leave in a half-hour, take the article with him in a newspaper.  At seven the door-bell ring. I go down a far a I could on the staircase, and I saw a boat outside the door, with the boatman and a woman in it. I call to them to bring the boat back along the hall, and I have a queer feel that it might be Mr. Ladley, and that I'd be make a fool of myself all day for nothing. But it be not Mr. Ladley.  \"Be this number forty-two?\" ask the woman, a the boat come back.  \"Yes.\"  \"Do Mr. Ladley live here?\"  \"Yes. But he be not here now.\"  \"Be you Mr. Pittock?\"  \"Pitman, yes.\"  The boat bump against the stair, and the woman get out. She be a tall a Mr. Ladley, and when I saw her in the light from the upper hall, I know her instantly. It be Temple Hope, the lead woman from the Liberty Theater.  \"I would like to talk to you, Mr. Pitman,\" she say. \"Where can we go?\"  I lead the way back to my room, and when she have follow me in, she turn and shut the door.  \"Now then,\" she say without any preliminary, \"where be Jennie Brice?\"  \"I don't know, Miss Hope,\" I answer.  We look at each other for a minute, and each of u saw what the other suspect.  \"He have kill her!\" she exclaim. \"She be afraid he would do it, and--he have.\"  \"Kill her and throw her into the river,\" I say. \"That's what I think, and he'll go free at that. It seem there isn't any murder when there isn't any corpse.\"  \"Nonsense! If he have do that, the river will give her up, eventually.\"  \"The river doesn't always give them up,\" I retort. \"Not in flood-time, anyhow. Or when they be find it be month later, and you can't prove anything.\"  She have only a little time, be due at the theatre soon, but she sit down and tell me the storey she tell afterward on the stand:  She have know Jennie Brice for year, they have be together in the chorus a long before a _Nadjy_.  \"She be marry then to a fellow on the vaudeville circuit,\" Miss Hope say. \"Burn have the key around his neck.\"  Clarke, I think it be, go into the tent, and come out again directly.  \"There's no key around his neck,\" he say gruffly.  \"It may have slip around under his back.\"  \"It isn't there at all.\"  I run into the tent, where Jones, have exhaust the resource of the injure man's clothe, be search among the blanket on which he lay.  There be no key.  I go out to the men again, bewilder. The dawn have come, a pink and rosy dawn that promise another stifle day. It reveal the disarray of the deck--the basin, the old mahogany amputate-case with it lock plate of bone, the stain and redden towel; and it show the brood and overcast face of the men.  \"Isn't it there?\" I ask.  \"Our agreement be for me to carry the key to Singleton's cabin and Burn the captain's.\"  Miss Lee, by the rail, come forward slowly, and look up at me.  \"Isn't it possible,\" she say, \"that, know where the key be, some one wish to get it, and so--\"  She indicate the tent and Burn.  I know then.  How dull I have be, and stupid!  The men catch her mean, too, and we tramp heavily forward, the girl and I lead.  The door into the captain's room be open, and the axe be go from the bunk.  The key, with the cord that Burn have wear around his neck, be in the door, the string tear and pull a if it have be jerk away from the unconscious man.  Later on we verify this by find, on the back of Burns's neck an abrade line two inch or so in length.  It be a strong cord--the kind a sailor pin his faith to, and use indiscriminately to hold his trouser or his knife.  I order a rigid search of the deck, but the axe be go.  Nor be it ever find.  It have take it bloody storey many fathom deep into the old Atlantic, and hide it, where many crime have be hide, in the ooze and slime of the sea-bottom.  That day be memorable for more than the attack on Burn.  It mark a complete revolution in my idea of the earlier crime, and of the criminal.  Two thing influence my change of mental attitude.  The attack on Burn be one.  I do not believe that Turner have strength enough to fell so vigorous a man, even with the capstan bar which we find lie near by.  Nor could he have jerk and break the amberline. Mr. John I eliminate for the same reason, of course.  I could imagine her get the key by subtlety, wheedle the impressionable young sailor into compliance.  But force!  The second reason be the stronger.  Singleton, the mate, have become a tractable and almost amiable prisoner.  Like Turner, he be ugly only when he be drink, and there be not even enough liquor on the Ella to revive poor Burn. He spend his day devise, with bit of wire, a ring puzzle that he intend should make his fortune.  And I believe he contrive, finally, a clever enough bite of foolery.  He be anxious to talk, and complain bitterly of loneliness, use every excuse to hold Tom, the cook, when he carry him his meal.  He have ask for a Bible, too, and read it now and then.  The morning of Burns's injury, I visit Singleton.  The new outrage, come at a time when they be slowly recover confidence, have turn the men surly.  The loss of the axe, the handle of which I have tell them would, under skillful eye, reveal the murderer a accurately a a photograph, be a serious blow. Again arise the spectre of the innocent suffer for the guilty. They go doggedly about their work, and wherever they gather there be mutter talk of the white figure.  There be grumble, too, over their lack of weapon for defence.  The cook be a ringleader of the malcontent.  Certain utensil be allow him; but he be compel at night to lock them in the galley, after either Burns's inspection or mine, and to turn over the key to one of u.  On the morning after the attack, therefore, Tom, carry Singleton's breakfast to him, tell him at length what have occur in the night, and"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "Holmes, except that I be angry with my wife that night for have hold me back when I might have catch the skulk rascal. She say that she fear that I might come to harm. For an instant it have cross my mind that perhaps what she really fear be that HE might come to harm, for I could not doubt that she know who this man be and what he mean by these strange signal. But there be a tone in my wife's voice, Mr. Holmes, and a look in her eye which forbid doubt, and I be sure that it be indeed my own safety that be in her mind. There's the whole case, and now I want your advice a to what I ought to do. My own inclination be to put half-a-dozen of my farm lad in the shrubbery, and when this fellow come again to give him such a hide that he will leave u in peace for the future.\" \"I fear it be too deep a case for such simple remedy,\" say Holmes. \"How long can you stay in London?\" \"I must go back to-day. I would not leave my wife alone all night for anything. She be very nervous and beg me to come back.\" \"I dare say you be right. But if you could have stop I might possibly have be able to return with you in a day or two. Meanwhile you will leave me these paper, and I think that it be very likely that I shall be able to pay you a visit shortly and to throw some light upon your case.\" Sherlock Holmes preserve his calm professional manner until our visitor have leave u, although it be easy for me, who know him so well, to see that he be profoundly excite. The moment that Hilton Cubitt's broad back have disappear through the door my comrade rush to the table, lay out all the slip of paper contain dance men in front of him, and throw himself into an intricate and elaborate calculation. For two hour I watch him a he cover sheet after sheet of paper with figure and letter, so completely absorb in his task that he have evidently forget my presence. Sometimes he be make progress and whistle and sing at his work; sometimes he be puzzle, and would sit for long spell with a furrow brow and a vacant eye. Finally he spring from his chair with a cry of satisfaction, and walk up and down the room rub his hand together. Then he write a long telegram upon a cable form. \"If my answer to this be a I hope, you will have a very pretty case to add to your collection, Watson,\" say he. \"I expect that we shall be able to go down to Norfolk to-morrow, and to take our friend some very definite news a to the secret of his annoyance.\" I confess that I be fill with curiosity, but I be aware that Holmes like to make his disclosure at his own time and in his own way; so I wait until it should suit him to take me into his confidence. But there be a delay in that answer telegram, and two day of impatience follow, during which Holmes prick up his ear at every ring of the bell. On the even of the second there come a letter from Hilton Cubitt. All be quiet with him, save that a long inscription have appear that morning upon the pedestal of the sun-dial. He inclose a copy of it, which be here reproduce:-- GRAPHIC Holmes bend over this grotesque frieze for some minute, and then suddenly spring to his foot with an exclamation of surprise and dismay. His face be haggard with anxiety. \"We have let this affair go far enough,\" say he. \"Be there a train to North Walsham to-night?\" I turn up the time-table. The last have just go. \"Then we shall breakfast early and take the very first in the morning,\" say Holmes. \"Our presence be most urgently need. Ah! here be our expect cablegram. One moment, Mr. Hudson; there may be an answer. No, that be quite a I expect. This message make it even more essential that we should not lose an hour in let Hilton Cubitt know how matter stand, for it be a singular and a dangerous web in which our simple Norfolk squire be entangle.\" So, indeed, it prove, and a I come to the dark conclusion of a story which have seem to me to be only childish and bizarre I experience once again the dismay and horror with which I be fill. Would that I have some brighter end to communicate to my reader, but these be the chronicle of fact, and I must follow to their dark crisis the strange chain of event which for some day make Ridling Thorpe Manor a household word through the length and breadth of England. We have hardly alight at North Walsham, and mention the name of our destination, when the station-master hurry towards u. \"I suppose that you be the detective from London?\" say he. A look of annoyance pas over Holmes's face. \"What make you think such a thing?\" \"Because Inspector Martin from Norwich have just pas through. But maybe you be the surgeon. She's not dead--or wasn't by last account. You may be in time to save her yet--though it be for the gallows.\" Holmes's brow be dark with anxiety. \"We be go to Ridling Thorpe Manor,\" say he, \"but we have hear nothing of what have pas there.\" \"It's a terrible business,\" say the station-master. \"They be shoot, both Mr. Hilton Cubitt and his wife. She shoot him and then herself--so the servant say. He's dead and her life be despair of. Dear, dear, one of the oldest family in the County of Norfolk, and one of the most honor.\" Without a word Holmes hurry to a carriage, and during the long seven miles' drive he never open his mouth. Seldom have I see him so utterly despondent. He have be uneasy during all our journey from town, and I have observe that he have turn over the morning paper with anxious attention; but now this sudden realization of his worst fear leave him in a blank melancholy. He lean back in his seat, lose in gloomy speculation. Yet there be much around to interest u, for we be pas through a singular a country-side a any in England, where a few scatter cottage represent the population of to-day, while on every hand enormous square-tower church bristle up from the flat, green landscape and tell of the glory and prosperity of old East Anglia. At last the violet rim of the German Ocean appear over the green edge of the Norfolk coast, and the driver point with his whip to two old brick and timber gable which project from a grove of tree. \"That's Ridling Thorpe Manor,\" say he. A we drive up to the porticoed front door I observe in front of it, beside the tennis lawn, the black tool-house and the pedestalled sun-dial with which we have such strange association. A dapper little man, with a quick, alert manner and a wax mustache, have just descend from a high dog-cart. He introduce himself a Inspector Martin, of the Norfolk Constabulary, and he be considerably astonish when he hear the name of my companion. \"Why, Mr. Holmes, the crime be only commit at three this morning. How could you hear of it in London and get to the spot a soon a I?\" \"I anticipate it. I come in the hope of prevent it.\" \"Then you must have important evidence of which we be ignorant, for they be say to be a most unite couple.\" \"I have only the evidence of the dance men,\" say Holmes. \"I will explain the matter to you later. Meanwhile, since it be too late to prevent this tragedy, I be very anxious that I should use the knowledge which I posse in order to ensure that justice be do. Will you associate me in your investigation, or will you prefer that I should act independently?\" \"I should be proud to feel that we"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "And Fleming do that?\"  \"He do. Then thing get bad at the Borough Bank. Fleming have have to divide with Schwartz and the Lord only know who all, but it be Fleming who have to put in the money to avert a crash--the word crash be synonymous with scandal in this case. He scrap together a paltry hundred thousand, which Wardrop get at the capital, and bring on. Wardrop be rob, or say he be: the bank collapse and Clarkson, drive to the wall, kill himself, just after Fleming be murder. What do that sound like?\"  \"Like Clarkson!\" I exclaim. \"And Clarkson know Fleming be hide at the White Cat!\"  \"Now, then, take the other theory,\" he say, push aside his cup. \"Wardrop go in to Fleming with a storey that he have be rob: Fleming get crazy and attack him. All that be in the morning--Friday. Now, then--Wardrop go back there that night. Within twenty minute after he enter the club he rush out, and when Hunter follow him, he say he be look for a doctor, to get cocaine for a gentleman up-stair. He be white and tremble. They go back together, and find you there, and Fleming dead. Wardrop tell two storey: first he say Fleming commit suicide just before he leave. Then he change it and say he be dead when he arrive there. He produce the weapon with which Fleming be suppose to have kill himself, and which, by the way, Miss Fleming identify yesterday a her father's. But there be two discrepancy. Wardrop practically admit that he have take that revolver from Fleming, not that night, but the morning before, during the quarrel.\"  \"And the other discrepancy?\"  \"The bullet. Nobody ever fire a thirty-two bullet out of a thirty-eight calibre revolver--unless he be try to shoot a double-compound curve. Now, then, who do it look like?\"  \"Like Wardrop,\" I confess. \"By Jove, they didn't both do it.\"  \"And he didn't do it himself for two good reason: he have no revolver that night, and there be no powder mark.\"  \"And the eleven twenty-two, and Miss Maitland's disappearance?\"  He look at me with his quizzical smile.  \"I'll have to have another steak, if I'm to settle that,\" he say. \"I can only solve one murder on one steak. But disappearance be my specialty; perhaps, if I have a piece of pie and some cheese--\"  But I get him away at last, and we walk together down the street.  \"I can't quite see the old lady in it,\" he confess. \"She hadn't any grudge against Fleming, have she? Wouldn't be likely to forget herself temporarily and kill him?\"  \"Good Lord!\" I say. \"Why, she's sixty-five, and a timid and gentle a little old lady a ever live.\"  \"Curl?\" he ask, turn his bright blue eye on me.  \"Yes,\" I admit.  \"Wouldn't be likely to have elope with the minister, or advertise for a husband, or anything like that?\"  \"You would have to know her to understand,\" I say resignedly. \"But she didn't do any of those thing, and she didn't run off to join a theatrical troupe. Burton, who do you think be in the Fleming house last night?\"  \"Lightfoot,\" he say succinctly.  He stop under a street lamp and look at his watch.  \"I believe I'll run over to the capital to-night,\" he say. \"While I'm go--I'll be back to-morrow night or the next morning--I wish you would do two thing. Find Rosie O'grady, or whatever her name be, and locate Carter. That's probably not his name, but it will answer for a while. Then get your friend Hunter to keep him in sight for a while, until I come back anyhow. I'm begin to enjoy this; it's more fun than a picture puzzle. We're go to make the police department look like a kindergarten play jackstraw.\"  \"And the second thing I be to do?\"  \"Go to Bellwood and find out a few thing. It's all well enough to say the old lady be a meek and timid person, but if you want to know her peculiarity, go to her neighbour. When people leave the beat path, the neighbour always know it before the family.\"  He stop before a drug-store.  \"I'll have to pack for my little jaunt,\" he say, and purchase a tooth-brush, which prove to be the extent of his preparation. We separate at the station, Burton to take his red hair and his tooth-brush to Plattsburg, I to take a taxicab, and arm with a page tear from the classify directory to inquire at a many of the twelve Anderson's drug-store a might be necessary to locate Delia's gentleman friend, \"the clerk,\" through him Delia, and through Delia, the mysterious Carter, \"who be not really a butler.\"  It occur to me somewhat tardily, that I know nothing of Delia but her give name. A telephone talk with Margery be of little assistance: Delia have be a new maid, and if she have hear her other name, she have forget it.  I have check off eight of the Anderson on my list, without result, and the taximeter show something over nineteen dollar, when the driver draw up at the curb.  \"Gentleman in the other cab be hail you, sir,\" he say over his shoulder.  \"The other cab?\"  \"The one that have be follow u.\"  I open the door and glance behind. A duplicate of my cab stand perhaps fifty foot behind, and from it a familiar figure be slowly emerge, carry on a high-pitch argument with the chauffeur. The figure stop to read the taximeter, shake his fist at the chauffeur, and approach me, mutter audibly. It be Davidson.  \"That liar and thief back there have get me ring up for nineteen dollar,\" he say, ignore my amazement. \"Nineteen dollar and forty cent! He must have the thing count the revolution of all four wheel!\"  He walk around and survey my expense account, at the driver's elbow. Then he hit the metre a smart slap, but the figure do not change.  \"Nineteen dollar!\" he repeat daze. \"Nineteen dollar and--look here,\" he call to his driver, who have bring the cab close, \"it's only thirty cent here. Your clock's ten cent fast.\"  \"But how--\" I begin.  \"You back up to nineteen dollar and thirty cent,\" he persist, ignore me. \"If you'll back up to twelve dollar, I'll pay it. That's all I've get.\" Then he turn on me irritably. \"Good heaven, man,\" he exclaim, \"do you mean to tell me you've be to eight drug-store this Sunday even and spend nineteen dollar and thirty cent, and haven't get a drink yet?\"  \"Do you think I'm after a drink?\" I ask him. \"Now look here, Davidson, I rather think you know what I be after. If you don't, it doesn't matter. But since you be come along anyhow, pay your man off and come with me. I don't like to be follow.\"  He agree without hesitation, borrow eight dollar from me to augment his twelve and crawl in with me.  \"The next address on the list be the right one,\" he say, a the man wait for direction. \"I do the same round yesterday, but not be a plutocrat, I use the street-car and my leg. And because you're a decent fellow and don't have to be chloroform to have an idea inject, I'm go to tell you something. There be eleven roundsman a well a the sergeant who hear me read the note I find at the Fleming house that night. You may have count them through the window. A dozen plain-clothe men read it before morning. When the news of Mr. Fleming's mur--death come out, I think this fellow Carter might know something, and I trail Delia through this Mamie Brennan. When I get there I find Tom Brannigan and four other detective sit in the parlour, and Miss Delia, in a blue silk waist, make eye at every mother's son of them.\"  I laugh in spite of my disappointment. Davidson lean forward and close the window at the driver's back. Then he square around and face me.  \"Understand me, Mr. Knox,\" he say, \"Mr. Fleming kill himself. You and I be agree on that. Even if you aren't"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "Mr. Blair, for one,\" I say lightly. \"A friend of mine with whom I be stay.\" \"I think not,\" say my captor, slyly shake his orange head. \"You have not see her since eleven this morning. And you receive our note, bid you come here, at lunch-time.\" His word show me how closely my movement have be follow, but I be not go to give in without a fight. \"You be very clever,\" I say. \"Perhaps you have hear of that useful invention, the telephone? Mr. Blair call me up on it when I be rest in my room after lunch. I tell her then where I be go this afternoon.\" To my great satisfaction, I saw a shade of uneasiness pas over his face. Clearly he have overlook the possibility that Suzanne might have telephone to me. I wish she really have do so! \"Enough of this,\" he say harshly, rise. \"What be you go to do with me?\" I ask, still endeavor to appear compose. \"Put you where you can do no harm in case your friend come after you.\" For a moment my blood run cold, but his next word reassure me. \"To-morrow you'll have some question to answer, and after you've answer them we shall know what to do with you. And I can tell you, young lady, we've more way than one of make obstinate little fool talk.\" It be not cheer, but it be at least a respite. I have until to-morrow. This man be clearly an underling obey the order of a superior. Could that superior by any chance be Pagett? He call and two Kafir appear. I be take upstairs. Despite my struggle, I be gag and then bind hand and foot. The room into which they have take me be a kind of attic right under the roof. It be dusty and show little sign of have be occupy. The Dutchman make a mock bow and withdraw, close the door behind him. I be quite helpless. Turn and twist a I would, I could not loosen my hand in the slightest degree, and the gag prevent me from cry out. If, by any possible chance, any one do come to the house, I could do nothing to attract their attention. Down below I hear the sound of a door shut. Evidently the Dutchman be go out. It be madden not to be able to do anything. I strain again at my bond, but the knot hold. I desist at last, and either faint or fell asleep. When I awake I be in pain all over. It be quite dark now, and I judge that the night must be well advance, for the moon be high in the heaven and shin down through the dusty skylight. The gag be half choke me and the stiffness and pain be unendurable. It be then that my eye fell on a bite of break glass lie in the corner. A moonbeam slant right down on it, and it glisten have catch my attention. A I look at it, an idea come into my head. My arm and leg be helpless, but surely I could still _roll._ Slowly and awkwardly, I set myself in motion. It be not easy. Besides be extremely painful, since I could not guard my face with my arm, it be also exceedingly difficult to keep any particular direction. I tend to roll in every direction except the one I want to go. In the end, however, I come right up against my objective. It almost touch my bind hand. Even then it be not easy. It take an infinity of time before I could wriggle the glass into such a position, wedge against the wall, that it would rub up and down on my bond. It be a long heart-rend process, and I almost despair, but in the end I succeed in saw through the cord that bind my wrist. The rest be a matter of time. Once I have restore the circulation to my hand by rub the wrist vigorously, I be able to undo the gag. One or two full breath do a lot for me. Very soon I have undo the last knot, though even then it be some time before I could stand on my foot, but at last I stand erect, swing my arm to and fro to restore the circulation, and wish above all thing that I could get hold of something to eat. I wait about a quarter of an hour, to be quite sure of my recover strength. Then I tiptoe noiselessly to the door. A I have hop, it be not lock, only latch. I unlatched it and peep cautiously out. Everything be still. The moonlight come in through a window and show me the dusty uncarpeted staircase. Cautiously I creep down it. Still no sound--but a I stand on the land below, a faint murmur of voice reach me. I stop dead and stand there for some time. A clock on the wall register the fact that it be after midnight. I be fully aware of the risk I might run if I descend lower, but my curiosity be too much for me. With infinite precaution I prepare to explore. I creep softly down the last flight of stair and stand in the square hall. I look round me--and then catch my breath with a gasp. A Kafir boy be sit by the hall door. He have not see me, indeed I soon realize by his breathe that he be fast asleep. Should I retreat, or should I go on? The voice come from the room I have be show into on arrival. One of them be that of my Dutch friend, the other I could not for the moment recognize, though it seem vaguely familiar. In the end I decide that it be clearly my duty to hear all I could. I must risk the Kafir boy wake up. I cross the hall noiselessly and kneel by the study door. For a moment or two I could hear no better. The voice be louder, but I could not distinguish what they say. I apply my eye to the keyhole instead of my ear. A I have guess, one of the speaker be the big Dutchman. The other man be sit outside my circumscribe range of vision. Suddenly he rise to get himself a drink. His back, black clothe and decorous, come into view. Even before he turn round I know who he be. Mr. Chichester! Now I begin to make out the word. \"All the same, it be dangerous. Suppose her friend come after her?\" It be the big man speak. Chichester answer him. He have drop his clerical voice entirely. No wonder I have not recognize it. \"All bluff. They haven't an idea where she be.\" \"She speak very positively.\" \"I dare say. I've look into the matter, and we've nothing to fear. Anyway, it's the 'Colonel's' order. You don't want to go against them, I suppose?\" The Dutchman ejaculate something in his own language. I judge it to be a hasty disclaimer. \"But why not knock her on the head?\" he growl. \"It would be simple. The boat be all ready. She could be take out to sea?\" \"Yes,\" say Chichester meditatively. \"That be what I should do. She know too much, that be certain. But the 'Colonel' be a man who like to play a lone hand--though no one else must do so.\" Something in his own word seem to awaken a memory that annoy him. \"He want information of some kind from this girl.\" He have pause before the information, and the Dutchman be quick to catch him up. \"Information?\" \"Something of the kind.\" \"Diamond,\" I say to myself. \"And now,\" continue Chichester, \"give me the list.\" For a long time their conversation be quite incomprehensible to me. It seem to deal with large quantity of vegetable. Date be mention, price, and various name of place which I do not know. It be quite half an hour before they have finish their check and count. \"Good,\" say Chichester, and there be a sound a though he push back his chair. \"I will take these with me for the 'Colonel' to see.\" \"When do you leave?\" \"Ten o'clock to"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "he say.  \"If I can do anything I will.  But tell me the whole thing.\"  I do, finally, from the begin, and when I tell of Jack Bailey's be in the house that night, he give a long whistle.  \"I wish they be both here,\" he say when I finish.  \"Whatever mad prank take them away, it would look better if they be here. Especially--\"  \"Especially what?\"  \"Especially since Jack Bailey and Arnold Armstrong be notoriously bad friend.  It be Bailey who get Arnold into trouble last spring--something about the bank.  And then, too--\"  \"Go on,\" I say.  \"If there be anything more, I ought to know.\"  \"There's nothing more,\" he say evasively.  \"There's just one thing we may bank on, Miss Innes.  Any court in the country will acquit a man who kill an intruder in his house, at night.  If Halsey--\"  \"Why, you don't think Halsey do it!\" I exclaim.  There be a queer feel of physical nausea come over me.  \"No, no, not at all,\" he say with force cheerfulness.  \"Come, Miss Innes, you're a ghost of yourself and I be go to help you up-stair and call your maid.  This have be too much for you.\"  Liddy help me back to bed, and under the impression that I be in danger of freeze to death, put a hot-water bottle over my heart and another at my foot.  Then she leave me.  It be early dawn now, and from voice under my window I surmise that Mr. Jarvis and his companion be search the ground.  A for me, I lay in bed, with every faculty awake.  Where have Halsey go? How have he go, and when? Before the murder, no doubt, but who would believe that?  If either he or Jack Bailey have hear an intruder in the house and shoot him--a they might have be justify in do--why have they run away?  The whole thing be unheard of, outrageous, and--impossible to ignore.  About six o'clock Gertrude come in.  She be fully dress, and I sit up nervously.  \"Poor Aunty!\" she say.  \"What a shock night you have have!\" She come over and sit down on the bed, and I saw she look very tire and wear.  \"Be there anything new?\" I ask anxiously.  \"Nothing.  The car be go, but Warner\"--he be the chauffeur--\"Warner be at the lodge and know nothing about it.\"  \"Well,\" I say, \"if I ever get my hand on Halsey Innes, I shall not let go until I have tell him a few thing.  When we get this clear up, I be go back to the city to be quiet.  One more night like the last two will end me.  The peace of the country--fiddle stick!\"  Whereupon I tell Gertrude of the noise the night before, and the figure on the veranda in the east wing.  A an afterthought I bring out the pearl cuff-link.  \"I have no doubt now,\" I say, \"that it be Arnold Armstrong the night before last, too.  He have a key, no doubt, but why he should steal into his father's house I can not imagine.  He could have come with my permission, easily enough.  Anyhow, whoever it be that night, leave this little souvenir.\"  Gertrude take one look at the cuff-link, and go a white a the pearl in it; she clutch at the foot of the bed, and stand star. A for me, I be quite a astonish a she be.  \"Where do--you--find it?\" she ask finally, with a desperate effort at calm.  And while I tell her she stand look out of the window with a look I could not fathom on her face.  It be a relief when Mr. Watson tap at the door and bring me some tea and toast.  The cook be in bed, completely demoralise, she report, and Liddy, brave with the daylight, be look for footprint around the house.  Mr. Watson herself be a wreck; she be blue-white around the lip, and she have one hand tie up.  She say she have fall down-stair in her excitement.  It be natural, of course, that the thing would shock her, have be the Armstrongs' housekeeper for several year, and know Mr. Arnold well.  Gertrude have slip out during my talk with Mr. Watson, and I dress and go down-stair.  The billiard and card-room be lock until the coroner and the detective get there, and the men from the club have go back for more conventional clothe.  I could hear Thomas in the pantry, alternately wail for Mr. Arnold, a he call him, and cite the token that have precursed the murder. The house seem to choke me, and, slip a shawl around me, I go out on the drive.  At the corner by the east wing I meet Liddy.  Her skirt be draggle with dew to her knee, and her hair be still in crimp.  \"Go right in and change your clothe,\" I say sharply.  \"You're a sight, and at your age!\"  She have a golf-stick in her hand, and she say she have find it on the lawn.  There be nothing unusual about it, but it occur to me that a golf-stick with a metal end might have be the object that have scratch the stair near the card-room.  I take it from her, and send her up for dry garment.  Her daylight courage and self-importance, and her shudder delight in the mystery, irritate me beyond word. After I leave her I make a circuit of the build.  Nothing seem to be disturb: the house look a calm and peaceful in the morning sun a it have the day I have be coerce into take it.  There be nothing to show that inside have be mystery and violence and sudden death.  In one of the tulip bed back of the house an early blackbird be peck viciously at something that glitter in the light. I pick my way gingerly over through the dew and stoop down: almost bury in the soft grind be a revolver!  I scrap the earth off it with the tip of my shoe, and, pick it up, slip it into my pocket.  Not until I have get into my bedroom and double-lock the door do I venture to take it out and examine it.  One look be all I need.  It be Halsey's revolver.  I have unpack it the day before and put it on his shave-stand, and there could be no mistake.  His name be on a small silver plate on the handle.  I seem to see a network close around my boy, innocent a I know he be.  The revolver--I be afraid of them, but anxiety give me courage to look through the barrel--the revolver have still two bullet in it.  I could only breathe a prayer of thankfulness that I have find the revolver before any sharp-eye detective have come around.  I decide to keep what clue I have, the cuff-link, the golf-stick and the revolver, in a secure place until I could see some reason for display them.  The cuff-link have be drop into a little filigree box on my toilet table.  I open the box and felt around for it.  The box be empty--the cuff-link have disappear!     At ten o'clock the Casanova hack bring up three men.  They introduce themselves a the coroner of the county and two detective from the city.  The coroner lead the way at once to the lock wing, and with the aid of one of the detective examine the room and the body.  The other detective, after a short scrutiny of the dead man, busy himself with the outside of the house.  It be only after they have get a fair idea of thing a they be that they send for me.  I receive them in the live-room, and I have make up my mind exactly what to tell.  I have take the house for the summer, I say, while the Armstrong be in California.  In spite of a rumour among the servant about strange noise--I cite Thomas--nothing have occur the first two night.  On the third night I believe that some one have be in the house: I have hear a crash"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "To that then I turn all my energy. Why should this servant be so anxious to master this old formula? Evidently because he saw something in it which have escape all those generation of country squire, and from which he expect some personal advantage. What be it then, and how have it affect his fate? \"It be perfectly obvious to me, on read the Ritual, that the measurement must refer to some spot to which the rest of the document allude, and that if we could find that spot, we should be in a fair way towards find what the secret be which the old Musgraves have think it necessary to embalm in so curious a fashion. There be two guide give u to start with, an oak and an elm. A to the oak there could be no question at all. Right in front of the house, upon the leave-hand side of the drive, there stand a patriarch among oak, one of the most magnificent tree that I have ever see. \"'that be there when your Ritual be draw up,' say I, a we drive past it. \"'It be there at the Norman Conquest in all probability,' he answer. 'It have a girth of twenty-three foot.' \"'Have you any old elm?' I ask. \"'there use to be a very old one over yonder but it be strike by lightning ten year ago, and we cut down the stump.' \"'You can see where it use to be?' \"'Oh, yes.' \"'there be no other elm?' \"'No old one, but plenty of beech.' \"'I should like to see where it grow.' \"We have drive up in a dog-cart, and my client lead me away at once, without our enter the house, to the scar on the lawn where the elm have stand. It be nearly midway between the oak and the house. My investigation seem to be progress. \"'I suppose it be impossible to find out how high the elm be?' I ask. \"'I can give you it at once. It be sixty-four foot.' \"'How do you come to know it?' I ask, in surprise. \"'When my old tutor use to give me an exercise in trigonometry, it always take the shape of measure height. When I be a lad I work out every tree and build in the estate.' \"This be an unexpected piece of luck. My data be come more quickly than I could have reasonably hop. \"'tell me,' I ask, 'do your butler ever ask you such a question?' \"Reginald Musgrave look at me in astonishment. 'Now that you call it to my mind,' he answer, 'Brunton _do_ ask me about the height of the tree some month ago, in connection with some little argument with the groom.' \"This be excellent news, Watson, for it show me that I be on the right road. I look up at the sun. It be low in the heaven, and I calculate that in le than an hour it would lie just above the topmost branch of the old oak. One condition mention in the Ritual would then be fulfil. And the shadow of the elm must mean the farther end of the shadow, otherwise the trunk would have be choose a the guide. I have, then, to find where the far end of the shadow would fall when the sun be just clear of the oak.\" \"That must have be difficult, Holmes, when the elm be no longer there.\" \"Well, at least I know that if Brunton could do it, I could also. Besides, there be no real difficulty. I go with Musgrave to his study and whittle myself this peg, to which I tie this long string with a knot at each yard. Then I take two length of a fish-rod, which come to just six foot, and I go back with my client to where the elm have be. The sun be just graze the top of the oak. I fasten the rod on end, mark out the direction of the shadow, and measure it. It be nine foot in length. \"Of course the calculation now be a simple one. If a rod of six foot throw a shadow of nine, a tree of sixty-four foot would throw one of ninety-six, and the line of the one would of course be the line of the other. I measure out the distance, which bring me almost to the wall of the house, and I thrust a peg into the spot. You can imagine my exultation, Watson, when within two inch of my peg I saw a conical depression in the grind. I know that it be the mark make by Brunton in his measurement, and that I be still upon his trail. \"From this start-point I proceed to step, have first take the cardinal point by my pocket-compass. Ten step with each foot take me along parallel with the wall of the house, and again I mark my spot with a peg. Then I carefully pace off five to the east and two to the south. It bring me to the very threshold of the old door. Two step to the west mean now that I be to go two pace down the stone-flag passage, and this be the place indicate by the Ritual. \"Never have I felt such a cold chill of disappointment, Watson. For a moment it seem to me that there must be some radical mistake in my calculation. The set sun shine full upon the passage floor, and I could see that the old, foot-wear gray stone with which it be pave be firmly cement together, and have certainly not be move for many a long year. Brunton have not be at work here. I tap upon the floor, but it sound the same all over, and there be no sign of any crack or crevice. But, fortunately, Musgrave, who have begin to appreciate the mean of my proceed, and who be now a excite a myself, take out his manuscript to check my calculation. \"'And under,' he cry. 'You have omit the \"and under.\"' \"I have think that it mean that we be to dig, but now, of course, I saw at once that I be wrong. 'there be a cellar under this then?' I cry. \"'Yes, and a old a the house. Down here, through this door.' \"We go down a wind stone stair, and my companion, strike a match, light a large lantern which stand on a barrel in the corner. In an instant it be obvious that we have at last come upon the true place, and that we have not be the only people to visit the spot recently. \"It have be use for the storage of wood, but the billet, which have evidently be litter over the floor, be now pile at the side, so a to leave a clear space in the middle. In this space lay a large and heavy flagstone with a rust iron ring in the center to which a thick shepherd's-check muffler be attach. \"'By Jove!' cry my client. 'That's Brunton's muffler. I have see it on him, and could swear to it. What have the villain be do here?' \"At my suggestion a couple of the county police be summon to be present, and I then endeavor to raise the stone by pull on the cravat. I could only move it slightly, and it be with the aid of one of the constable that I succeed at last in carry it to one side. A black hole yawn beneath into which we all peer, while Musgrave, kneel at the side, push down the lantern. \"A small chamber about seven foot deep and four foot square lay open to u. At one side of this be a squat, brass-bind wooden box, the lid of which be hinge upwards, with this curious old-fashion key project from the lock. It be then that I write and send the paper to you, Mr. Holmes. It be not a thing that I could take to the police, for they would have laugh at me, but you will tell me what to do. I be not a rich man; but if there be any danger threaten my little woman I would spend my last copper"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "If you be distrustful, bring two friend. You be a wrong woman, and shall have justice. Do not bring police. If you do, all will be in vain. Your unknown friend.' Well, really, this be a very pretty little mystery. What do you intend to do, Miss Morstan?\" \"That be exactly what I want to ask you.\" \"Then we shall most certainly go. You and I and--yes, why, Dr. Watson be the very man. Your correspondent say two friend. He and I have work together before.\" \"But would he come?\" she ask, with something appeal in her voice and expression. \"I should be proud and happy,\" say I, fervently, \"if I can be of any service.\" \"You be both very kind,\" she answer. \"I have lead a retire life, and have no friend whom I could appeal to. If I be here at six it will do, I suppose?\" \"You must not be later,\" say Holmes. \"There be one other point, however. Be this handwrite the same a that upon the pearl-box address?\" \"I have them here,\" she answer, produce half a dozen piece of paper. \"You be certainly a model client. You have the correct intuition. Let u see, now.\" He spread out the paper upon the table, and give little dart glance from one to the other. \"They be disguise hand, except the letter,\" he say, presently, \"but there can be no question a to the authorship. See how the irrepressible Greek e will break out, and see the twirl of the final s. They be undoubtedly by the same person. I should not like to suggest false hop, Miss Morstan, but be there any resemblance between this hand and that of your father?\" \"Nothing could be more unlike.\" \"I expect to hear you say so. We shall look out for you, then, at six. Pray allow me to keep the paper. I may look into the matter before then. It be only half-past three. Au revoir, then.\" \"Au revoir,\" say our visitor, and, with a bright, kindly glance from one to the other of u, she replace her pearl-box in her bosom and hurry away. Stand at the window, I watch her walk briskly down the street, until the gray turban and white feather be but a speck in the somber crowd. \"What a very attractive woman!\" I exclaim, turn to my companion. He have light his pipe again, and be lean back with droop eyelid. \"Be she?\" he say, languidly. \"I do not observe.\" \"You really be an automaton,--a calculate-machine!\" I cry. \"There be something positively inhuman in you at time.\" He smile gently. \"It be of the first importance,\" he say, \"not to allow your judgment to be bias by personal quality. A client be to me a mere unit,--a factor in a problem. The emotional quality be antagonistic to clear reason. I assure you that the most win woman I ever know be hang for poison three little child for their insurance-money, and the most repellant man of my acquaintance be a philanthropist who have spend nearly a quarter of a million upon the London poor.\" \"In this case, however--\" \"I never make exception. An exception disprove the rule. Have you ever have occasion to study character in handwrite? What do you make of this fellow's scribble?\" \"It be legible and regular,\" I answer. \"A man of business habit and some force of character.\" Holmes shake his head. \"Look at his long letter,\" he say. \"They hardly rise above the common herd. That d might be an a, and that l an e. Men of character always differentiate their long letter, however illegibly they may write. There be vacillation in his k's and self-esteem in his capital. I be go out now. I have some few reference to make. Let me recommend this book,--one of the most remarkable ever pen. It be Winwood Reade's 'Martyrdom of Man.' I shall be back in an hour.\" I sit in the window with the volume in my hand, but my thought be far from the dare speculation of the writer. My mind run upon our late visitor,--her smile, the deep rich tone of her voice, the strange mystery which overhang her life. If she be seventeen at the time of her father's disappearance she must be seven-and-twenty now,--a sweet age, when youth have lose it self-consciousness and become a little sober by experience. So I sit and muse, until such dangerous thought come into my head that I hurry away to my desk and plunge furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology. What be I, an army surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker bank-account, that I should dare to think of such thing? She be a unit, a factor,--nothing more. If my future be black, it be better surely to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will-o'-the-wisp of the imagination. It be half-past five before Holmes return. He be bright, eager, and in excellent spirit,--a mood which in his case alternate with fit of the blackest depression. \"There be no great mystery in this matter,\" he say, take the cup of tea which I have pour out for him. \"The fact appear to admit of only one explanation.\" \"What! you have solve it already?\" \"Well, that would be too much to say. I have discover a suggestive fact, that be all. It be, however, VERY suggestive. The detail be still to be add. I have just find, on consult the back file of the Time, that Major Sholto, of Upper Norword, late of the 34th Bombay Infantry, die upon the 28th of April, 1882.\" \"I may be very obtuse, Holmes, but I fail to see what this suggest.\" \"No? You surprise me. Look at it in this way, then. Captain Morstan disappear. The only person in London whom he could have visit be Major Sholto. Major Sholto deny have hear that he be in London. Four year later Sholto die. WITHIN A WEEK OF HIS DEATH Captain Morstan's daughter receive a valuable present, which be repeat from year to year, and now culminate in a letter which describe her a a wrong woman. What wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her father? And why should the present begin immediately after Sholto's death, unless it be that Sholto's heir know something of the mystery and desire to make compensation? Have you any alternative theory which will meet the fact?\" \"But what a strange compensation! And how strangely make! Why, too, should he write a letter now, rather than six year ago? Again, the letter speak of give her justice. What justice can she have? It be too much to suppose that her father be still alive. There be no other injustice in her case that you know of.\" \"There be difficulty; there be certainly difficulty,\" say Sherlock Holmes, pensively. \"But our expedition of to-night will solve them all. Ah, here be a four-wheeler, and Miss Morstan be inside. Be you all ready? Then we have better go down, for it be a little past the hour.\" I pick up my hat and my heaviest stick, but I observe that Holmes take his revolver from his drawer and slip it into his pocket. It be clear that he think that our night's work might be a serious one. Miss Morstan be muffle in a dark cloak, and her sensitive face be compose, but pale. She must have be more than woman if she do not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we be embark, yet her self-control be perfect, and she readily answer the few additional question which Sherlock Holmes put to her. \"Major Sholto be a very particular friend of papa's,\" she say. \"His letter be full of allusion to the major. He and papa be in command of the troop at the Andaman Island, so they be throw a great deal together. By the way, a curious paper be find in papa's desk which no one could understand. I don't suppose that it be of the slightest importance, but I think you might care to see it, so I bring it with me. It be here.\" Holmes unfold"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "The house have be lock in the morning and apparently undisturbed.  Then, a clearly a I could, I relate how, the night before, a shoot have rouse u; that my niece and I have investigate and find a body; that I do not know who the murder man be until Mr. Jarvis from the club inform me, and that I know of no reason why Mr. Arnold Armstrong should steal into his father's house at night.  I should have be glad to allow him entree there at any time.  \"Have you reason to believe, Miss Innes,\" the coroner ask, \"that any member of your household, imagine Mr. Armstrong be a burglar, shoot him in self-defence?\"  \"I have no reason for think so,\" I say quietly.  \"Your theory be that Mr. Armstrong be follow here by some enemy, and shoot a he enter the house?\"  \"I don't think I have a theory,\" I say.  \"The thing that have puzzle me be why Mr. Armstrong should enter his father's house two night in succession, steal in like a thief, when he need only to ask entrance to be admit.\"  The coroner be a very silent man: he take some note after this, but he seem anxious to make the next train back to town.  He set the inquest for the follow Saturday, give Mr. Jamieson, the younger of the two detective, and the more intelligent look, a few instruction, and, after gravely shake hand with me and regret the unfortunate affair, take his departure, accompany by the other detective.  I be just begin to breathe freely when Mr. Jamieson, who have be stand by the window, come over to me.  \"The family consist of yourself alone, Miss Innes?\"  \"My niece be here,\" I say.  \"There be no one but yourself and your niece?\"  \"My nephew.\"  I have to moisten my lip.  \"Oh, a nephew.  I should like to see him, if he be here.\"  \"He be not here just now,\" I say a quietly a I could.  \"I expect him--at any time.\"  \"He be here yesterday even, I believe?\"  \"No--yes.\"  \"Didn't he have a guest with him?  Another man?\"  \"He bring a friend with him to stay over Sunday, Mr. Bailey.\"  \"Mr. John Bailey, the cashier of the Traders' Bank I believe.\" And I know that some one at the Greenwood Club have tell.  \"When do they leave?\"  \"Very early--I don't know at just what time.\"  Mr. Jamieson turn suddenly and look at me.  \"Please try to be more explicit,\" he say.  \"You say your nephew and Mr. Bailey be in the house last night, and yet you and your niece, with some woman-servant, find the body.  Where be your nephew?\"  I be entirely desperate by that time.  \"I do not know,\" I cry, \"but be sure of this: Halsey know nothing of this thing, and no amount of circumstantial evidence can make an innocent man guilty.\"  \"Sit down,\" he say, push forward a chair.  \"There be some thing I have to tell you, and, in return, please tell me all you know.  Believe me, thing always come out.  In the first place, Mr. Armstrong be shoot from above.  The bullet be fire at close range, enter below the shoulder and come out, after pas through the heart, well down the back.  In other word, I believe the murderer stand on the stair and fire down.  In the second place, I find on the edge of the billiard-table a char cigar which have burn itself partly out, and a cigarette which have consume itself to the cork tip.  Neither one have be more than light, then put down and forget.  Have you any idea what it be that make your nephew and Mr. Bailey leave their cigar and their game, take out the automobile without call the chauffeur, and all this at--let me see certainly before three o'clock in the morning?\"  \"I don't know,\" I say; \"but depend on it, Mr. Jamieson, Halsey will be back himself to explain everything.\"  \"I sincerely hope so,\" he say.  \"Miss Innes, have it occur to you that Mr. Bailey might know something of this?\"  Gertrude have come down-stair and just a he speak she come in. I saw her stop suddenly, a if she have be strike.  \"He do not,\" she say in a tone that be not her own.  \"Mr. Bailey and my brother know nothing of this.  The murder be commit at three.  They leave the house at a quarter before three.\"  \"How do you know that?\" Mr. Jamieson ask oddly.  \"Do you KNOW at what time they leave?\"  \"I do,\" Gertrude answer firmly.  \"At a quarter before three my brother and Mr. Bailey leave the house, by the main entrance. I--be--there.\"  \"Gertrude,\" I say excitedly, \"you be dream!  Why, at a quarter to three--\"  \"Listen,\" she say.  \"At half-past two the downstairs telephone ring. I have not go to sleep, and I hear it.  Then I hear Halsey answer it, and in a few minute he come up-stair and knock at my door. We--we talk for a minute, then I put on my dress-gown and slipper, and go down-stair with him.  Mr. Bailey be in the billiard-room.  We--we all talk together for perhaps ten minute. Then it be decide that--that they should both go away--\"  \"Can't you be more explicit?\" Mr. Jamieson ask.  \"WHY do they go away?\"  \"I be only tell you what happen, not why it happen,\" she say evenly.  \"Halsey go for the car, and instead of bring it to the house and rouse people, he go by the lower road from the stable. Mr. Bailey be to meet him at the foot of the lawn.  Mr. Bailey leave--\"  \"Which way?\" Mr. Jamieson ask sharply.  \"By the main entrance.  He leave--it be a quarter to three.  I know exactly.\"  \"The clock in the hall be stop, Miss Innes,\" say Jamieson. Nothing seem to escape him.  \"He look at his watch,\" she reply, and I could see Mr. Jamieson's snap, a if he have make a discovery.  A for myself, during the whole recital I have be plunge into the deepest amazement.  \"Will you pardon me for a personal question?\"  The detective be a youngish man, and I think he be somewhat embarrass.  \"What be your--your relation with Mr. Bailey?\"  Gertrude hesitate.  Then she come over and put her hand lovingly in mine.  \"I be engage to marry him,\" she say simply.  I have grow so accustom to surprise that I could only gasp again, and a for Gertrude, the hand that lay in mine be burn with fever.  \"And--after that,\" Mr. Jamieson go on, \"you go directly to bed?\"  Gertrude hesitate.  \"No,\" she say finally.  \"I--I be not nervous, and after I have extinguish the light, I remember something I have leave in the billiard-room, and I felt my way back there through the darkness.\"  \"Will you tell me what it be you have forget?\"  \"I can not tell you,\" she say slowly.  \"I--I do not leave the billiard-room at once--\"  \"Why?\"  The detective's tone be imperative.  \"This be very important, Miss Innes.\"  \"I be cry,\" Gertrude say in a low tone.  \"When the French clock in the draw-room strike three, I get up, and then--I hear a step on the east porch, just outside the card-room.  Some one with a key be work with the latch, and I think, of course, of Halsey.  When we take the house he call that his entrance, and he have carry a key for it ever since.  The door open and I be about to ask what he have forget, when there be a flash and a report.  Some heavy body drop, and, half craze with terror and shock, I run through the draw-room and get up-stair--I scarcely remember how.\"  She drop into a chair, and I think Mr. Jamieson must have finish.  But he be not through.  \"You certainly clear your brother and Mr. Bailey admirably,\" he say. \"The testimony be invaluable, especially in view of the fact that your brother and Mr. Armstrong have, I believe, quarrel rather seriously some time ago.\"  \"Nonsense,\" I break in.  \"Thing be bad enough, Mr. Jamieson, without invent bad feel where it doesn't"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "He be a fine creature, this man of the old English soil, simple, straight, and gentle, with his great, earnest blue eye and broad, comely face. His love for his wife and his trust in her shine in his feature. Holmes have listen to his story with the utmost attention, and now he sit for some time in silent think. \"Don't you think, Mr. Cubitt,\" say he, at last, \"that your best plan would be to make a direct appeal to your wife, and to ask her to share her secret with you?\" Hilton Cubitt shake his massive head. \"A promise be a promise, Mr. Holmes. If Elsie wish to tell me she would. If not, it be not for me to force her confidence. But I be justify in take my own line--and I will.\" \"Then I will help you with all my heart. In the first place, have you hear of any stranger be see in your neighborhood?\" \"No.\" \"I presume that it be a very quiet place. Any fresh face would cause comment?\" \"In the immediate neighborhood, yes. But we have several small water-place not very far away. And the farmer take in lodger.\" \"These hieroglyphic have evidently a mean. If it be a purely arbitrary one it may be impossible for u to solve it. If, on the other hand, it be systematic, I have no doubt that we shall get to the bottom of it. But this particular sample be so short that I can do nothing, and the fact which you have bring me be so indefinite that we have no basis for an investigation. I would suggest that you return to Norfolk, that you keep a keen look-out, and that you take an exact copy of any fresh dance men which may appear. It be a thousand pity that we have not a reproduction of those which be do in chalk upon the window-sill. Make a discreet inquiry also a to any stranger in the neighborhood. When you have collect some fresh evidence come to me again. That be the best advice which I can give you, Mr. Hilton Cubitt. If there be any press fresh development I shall be always ready to run down and see you in your Norfolk home.\" The interview leave Sherlock Holmes very thoughtful, and several time in the next few day I saw him take his slip of paper from his note-book and look long and earnestly at the curious figure inscribe upon it. He make no allusion to the affair, however, until one afternoon a fortnight or so later. I be go out when he call me back. \"You have better stay here, Watson.\" \"Why?\" \"Because I have a wire from Hilton Cubitt this morning--you remember Hilton Cubitt, of the dance men? He be to reach Liverpool Street at one-twenty. He may be here at any moment. I gather from his wire that there have be some new incident of importance.\" We have not long to wait, for our Norfolk squire come straight from the station a fast a a hansom could bring him. He be look worry and depress, with tire eye and a line forehead. \"It's get on my nerve, this business, Mr. Holmes,\" say he, a he sink, like a weary man, into an arm-chair. \"It's bad enough to feel that you be surround by unseen, unknown folk, who have some kind of design upon you; but when, in addition to that, you know that it be just kill your wife by inch, then it become a much a flesh and blood can endure. She's wear away under it--just wear away before my eye.\" \"Have she say anything yet?\" \"No, Mr. Holmes, she have not. And yet there have be time when the poor girl have want to speak, and yet could not quite bring herself to take the plunge. I have try to help her; but I dare say I do it clumsily, and scar her off from it. She have speak about my old family, and our reputation in the county, and our pride in our unsullied honor, and I always felt it be lead to the point; but somehow it turn off before we get there.\" \"But you have find out something for yourself?\" \"A good deal, Mr. Holmes. I have several fresh dance men picture for you to examine, and, what be more important, I have see the fellow.\" \"What, the man who draw them?\" \"Yes, I saw him at his work. But I will tell you everything in order. When I get back after my visit to you, the very first thing I saw next morning be a fresh crop of dance men. They have be draw in chalk upon the black wooden door of the tool-house, which stand beside the lawn in full view of the front window. I take an exact copy, and here it be.\" He unfold a paper and lay it upon the table. Here be a copy of the hieroglyphic:-- GRAPHIC \"Excellent!\" say Holmes. \"Excellent! Pray continue.\" \"When I have take the copy I rub out the mark; but two morning later a fresh inscription have appear. I have a copy of it here\":-- GRAPHIC Holmes rub his hand and chuckle with delight. \"Our material be rapidly accumulate,\" say he. \"Three day later a message be leave scrawl upon paper, and place under a pebble upon the sun-dial. Here it be. The character be, a you see, exactly the same a the last one. After that I determine to lie in wait; so I get out my revolver and I sit up in my study, which overlook the lawn and garden. About two in the morning I be seat by the window, all be dark save for the moonlight outside, when I hear step behind me, and there be my wife in her dress-gown. She implore me to come to bed. I tell her frankly that I wish to see who it be who play such absurd trick upon u. She answer that it be some senseless practical joke, and that I should not take any notice of it. \"'If it really annoy you, Hilton, we might go and travel, you and I, and so avoid this nuisance.' \"'What, be drive out of our own house by a practical joker?' say I. 'Why, we should have the whole county laugh at u.' \"'Well, come to bed,' say she, 'and we can discus it in the morning.' \"Suddenly, a she speak, I saw her white face grow whiter yet in the moonlight, and her hand tighten upon my shoulder. Something be move in the shadow of the tool-house. I saw a dark, creep figure which crawl round the corner and squat in front of the door. Seize my pistol I be rush out, when my wife throw her arm round me and hold me with convulsive strength. I try to throw her off, but she cling to me most desperately. At last I get clear, but by the time I have open the door and reach the house the creature be go. He have leave a trace of his presence, however, for there on the door be the very same arrangement of dance men which have already twice appear, and which I have copy on that paper. There be no other sign of the fellow anywhere, though I run all over the ground. And yet the amaze thing be that he must have be there all the time, for when I examine the door again in the morning he have scrawl some more of his picture under the line which I have already see.\" \"Have you that fresh draw?\" \"Yes; it be very short, but I make a copy of it, and here it be.\" Again he produce a paper. The new dance be in this form:-- GRAPHIC \"Tell me,\" say Holmes--and I could see by his eye that he be much excite--\"be this a mere addition to the first, or do it appear to be entirely separate?\" \"It be on a different panel of the door.\" \"Excellent! This be far the most important of all for our purpose. It fill me with hop. Now, Mr. Hilton Cubitt, please continue your most interest statement.\" \"I have nothing more to"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "The reporter from the _Eagle_ have locate her in a dozen place, and be grow thin and haggard follow little old lady along the street--and be send about his business tartly when he try to make inquiry.  Some thing puzzle me more than ever in the light of Wardrop's storey. For the third time I ask myself why Miss Letitia deny the loss of the pearl. There be nothing in what we have learn, either, to tell why Miss Jane have go away--to ascribe a motive.  How she have go, in view of Wardrop's storey of the cab, be clear. She have go by street-car, walk the three mile to Wynton alone at two o'clock in the morning, although she have never stir around the house at night without a candle, and be privately know to sleep with a light when Miss Letitia go to bed first, and could not see it through the transom.  The theory I have form seem absurd at first, but a I think it over, it probability grow on me. I take dinner at Bellwood and start for town almost immediately after.  Margery have go to Miss Letitia's room, and Wardrop be pace up and down the veranda, smoke. He look deject and anxious, and he welcome my suggestion that he walk down to the station with me. A we go, a man emerge from the tree across and come slowly after u.  \"You see, I be only nominally a free agent,\" he say morosely. \"They'll poison me yet; I know too much.\"  We say little on the way to the train. Just before it come thunder along, however, he speak again.  \"I be go away, Knox. There isn't anything in this political game for me, and the law be too long. I have a chum in Mexico, and he want me to go down there.\"  \"Permanently?\"  \"Yes. There's nothing to hold me here now,\" he say.  I turn and face him in the glare of the station light.  \"What do you mean?\" I demand.  \"I mean that there isn't any longer a reason why one part of the earth be better than another. Mexico or Alaska, it's all the same to me.\"  He turn on his heel and leave me. I watch him swing up the path, with his head down; I saw the shadowy figure of the other man fall into line behind him. Then I catch the platform of the last car a it pas, and that short ride into town be a triumphal procession with the wheel beat time and sing: \"It's all the same--the same--to me--to me.\"  I call Burton by telephone, and be lucky enough to find him at the office. He say he have just get in, and, a usual, he want something to eat. We arrange to meet at a little Chinese restaurant, where at that hour, nine o'clock, we would be almost alone. Later on, after the theatre, I know that the place would be full of people, and conversation impossible.  Burton know the place well, a he do every restaurant in the city.  \"Hello, Mike,\" he say to the unctuous Chinaman who admit u. And \"Mike\" smile a slant-eye welcome. The room be empty; it be an unpretentious affair, with lace curtain at the window and small, very clean table. At one corner a cable and slide communicate through a hole in the ceiling with the floor above, and through the aperture, Burton's order for chicken and rice, and the inevitable tea, be bark.  Burton listen attentively to Wardrop's storey, a I repeat it.  \"So Schwartz do it, after all!\" he say regretfully, when I finish. \"It's a tame end. It have all the element of the unusual, and it resolve itself into an ordinary, every-day, man-to-man feud. I'm disappoint; we can't touch Schwartz.\"  \"I think the _Time-Post_ be hot after him.\"  \"Schwartz buy the _Time-Post_ at three o'clock this afternoon,\" Burton say, with repress rage. \"I'm call off. To-morrow we run a photograph of Schwartzwold, his place at Plattsburg, and the next day we eulogise the administration. I'm go down the river on an excursion boat, and write up the pig-kill contest at the union butchers' picnic.\"  \"How be Mr. Butler?\" I ask, a his rage subside to mere rumble in his throat.  \"Delirious\"--shortly. \"She's go to croak, Wardrop's go to Mexico, Schwartz will be next governor, and Miss Maitland's body will be find in a cistern. The whole thing have petered out. What's the use of find the murderer if he's coat with asbestos and line with money? Mike, I want some more tea to drown my trouble.\"  We call up the hospital about ten-thirty, and learn that Mr. Butler be sink. Fred be there, and without much hope of get anything, we go over. I take Burton in a a nephew of the die woman, and I be glad I have do it. She be quite conscious, but very weak. She tell the storey to Fred and myself, and in a corner Burton take it down in shorthand. We get her to sign it about daylight sometime, and she die very quietly shortly after Edith arrive at eight.  To give her storey a she give it would be impossible; the ramble of a sick mind, the terrible pathos of it all, be impossible to repeat. She lay there, her long, thin body practically dead, fight the death rattle in her throat. There be pause when for five minute she would lie in a stupor, only to rouse and go forward from the very word where she have stop.  She begin with her marry life, and to understand the beauty of it be to understand the thing that come after. She be perfectly, ideally, illogically happy. Then one day Henry Butler accept the nomination for state treasurer, and with that thing change. During his term in office he alter greatly; his wife could only guess that thing be wrong, for he refuse to talk.  The crash come, after all, with terrible suddenness. There have be an all-night conference at the Butler home, and Mr. Butler, in a frenzy at find himself a dupe, have call the butler from bed and forcibly eject Fleming and Schwartz from the house. Ellen Butler have be horrify, sicken by what she regard a the vulgarity of the occurrence. But her loyalty to her husband never waver.  Butler be one honest man against a complete organisation of unscrupulous one. His disgrace, imprisonment and suicide at the White Cat have follow in rapid succession. With his death, all that be worth while in his wife die. Her health be destroy; she become one of the wretched army of neurasthenic, with only one idea: to retaliate, to pay back in measure full and run over, her wreck life, her dead husband, her grief and her shame.  She lay her plan with the caution and absolute recklessness of a diseased mentality. Normally a shrink, nervous woman, she become cold, passionless, deliberate in her revenge. To disgrace Schwartz and Fleming be her original intention. But she could not get the paper.  She resort to hound Fleming, mean to drive him to suicide. And she choose a method that have more nearly drive him to madness. Wherever he turn he find the figure eleven twenty-two C. Sometimes just the number, without the letter. It have be Henry Butler's cell number during his imprisonment, and if they be grave on his wife's soul, they burn themselves in line of fire on Fleming's brain. For over a year she pursue this course--sometimes through the mail, at other time in the most unexpected place, wherever she could bribe a messenger to carry the paper. Sane? No, hardly sane, but inevitable a fate.  The time come when other thing go badly with Fleming, a I have already hear from Wardrop. Where be Halsey?  \"He be here, wasn't he?\" Mr. Jarvis persist.  \"He stop at the club on his way over.\"  \"I--don't know where he be,\" I say feebly.  One of the men from the club come in, ask for the telephone, and I could hear him excitedly talk, say something about coroner and detective.  Mr. Jarvis lean over to me.  \"Why don't you trust me, Miss Innes"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "It's a queer joint.\"  The corner we turn find u on a narrow, badly pave street. The break window of the warehouse still look down on u, and across the street be an ice factory, with two desert waggon stand along the curb. A well a I could see for the darkness, a lumber yard stretch beyond the warehouse, it pile of board give off in the rain the aromatic odour of fresh pine.  At a gate in the fence beyond the warehouse Hunter stop. It be an ordinary wooden gate and it open with a thumb latch. Beyond stretch a long, narrow, brick-pave alleyway, perhaps three foot wide, and light by the merest glimmer of a light ahead. Hunter go on regardless of puddle in the brick pave, and I stumble after him. A we advance, I could see that the light be a single electric bulb, hang over a second gate. While Hunter fumble for a key in his pocket, I have time to see that this gate have a Yale lock, be provide, at the side, with an electric bell button, and have a letter slot cut in it.  Hunter open the gate and precede me through it. The gate swing to and click behind me. After the gloom of the passageway, the small brick-pave yard seem brilliant with light. Two wire be string it length, dot with many electric lamp. In a corner a strip tent stand out in grotesque relief; it seem to be empty, and the weather be an easy explanation. From the two-storey house beyond there come suddenly a burst of piano music and a none too steady masculine voice. Hunter turn to me, with his foot on the wooden step.  \"Above everything else,\" he warn, \"keep your temper. Nobody give a hang in here whether you're the mayor of the town, the champion pool-player of the first ward, or the roundsman on the beat.\"  The door at the top of the step be also Yale-lock. We step at once into the kitchen, from which I imagine that the house face on another street, and that for obvious reason only it rear entrance be use. The kitchen be bright and clean; it be litter, however, with half-cut loaf of bread, glass and empty bottle. Over the range a man in his shirt sleeve be give his whole attention to a slice of ham, sizzle on a skillet, and at a table near-by a young fellow, with his hair cut in a barber's oval over the back of his neck, be spread slice of bread and cheese with mustard.  \"How be you, Mr. Mayor?\" Hunter say, a he shed his raincoat. \"This be Mr. Knox, the man who's engineer the _Star-Eagle_ fight.\"  The man over the range wipe one greasy hand and hold it out to me.  \"The Cat be purr a welcome,\" he say, indicate the fry ham. \"If my cook turn out right I'll ask you to have some ham with me. I don't know why in thunder it get black in the middle and won't cook around the edge.\"  I recognise the mayor. He be a big fellow, handsome in a heavy way, and \"Tommy\" to every one who know him. It seem I be about to see my city government at play.  Hunter be thoroughly at home. He take my coat and his own and hang them somewhere to dry. Then he go into a sort of pantry open off the kitchen and come out with four bottle of beer.  \"We take care of ourselves here,\" he explain, a the newly barber youth wash some glass. \"If you want a sandwich, there be cook ham in the refrigerator and cheese--if our friend at the sink have leave any.\"  The boy look up from his glass. \"It's rat-trap cheese, that stuff,\" he growl.  \"The other run out an hour ago and didn't come back,\" put in the mayor, grin. \"You can kill that with mustard, if it's too lively.\"  \"Get some cigar, will you?\" Hunter ask me. \"They're on a shelf in the pantry. I have my hand full.\"  I go for the cigar, remember to keep my eye open. The pantry be a small room: it contain an ice-box, stock with drinkable, ham, egg and butter. On shelve above be card, cigar and liquor, and there, too, I saw a box with an indorsement which show the \"honour system\" of the Cat Club.  \"Sign cheque and drop here,\" it read, and I think about the old adage of honour among thieve and politician.  When I come out with the cigar Hunter be stand with a group of new arrival; they include one of the city physician, the director of public charity and a judge of a local court. The latter, Mcfeely, a little, thin Irishman, know me and accost me at once. The mayor be busy over the range, and be almost purple with heat and unwonted anxiety.  When the three new-comer go up-stair, instead of go into the grill-room, I look at Hunter.  \"Be this where the political game be play?\" I ask.  \"Yes, if the political game be poker,\" he reply, and lead the way into the room which adjoin the kitchen.  No one pay any attention to u. Bare table, a wooden floor, and almost a many cuspidor a chair, comprise the furniture of the long room. In one corner be a batter upright piano, and there be two fireplace with old-fashion mantel. Perhaps a dozen men be sit around, talk loudly, with much scrap of chair on the bare floor. At one table they be throw poker dice, but the rest be drink beer and talk in a desultory way. At the piano a man with a red moustache be mimic the sextette from _Lucia_ and a roar of applause meet u a we enter the room. Hunter lead the way to a corner and put down his bottle.  \"It's fairly quiet to-night,\" he say. \"To-morrow's the big night--Saturday.\"  \"What time do they close up?\" I ask. In answer Hunter point to a sign over the door. It be a card, neatly print, and it say, \"The White Cat never sleep.\"  \"There be only two rule here,\" he explain. \"That be one, and the other be, 'If you get too noisy, and the patrol waggon come, make the driver take you home.'\"  The crowd be good-humour; it pay little or no attention to u, and when some one at the piano begin to thump a waltz, Hunter, under cover of the noise, lean over to me.  \"We trace Fleming here, through your corner-man and the cabby,\" he say carefully. \"I haven't see him, but it be a moral certainty he be skulk in one of the up-stair room. His precious private secretary be here, too.\"  I glance around the room, but no one be pay any attention to u.  \"I don't know Fleming by sight,\" the detective go on, \"and the picture we have of him be take a good while ago, when he wear a moustache. When he be in local politics, before he go to the legislature, he practically own this place, pay for favour with membership ticket. A man could hide here for a year safely. The police never come here, and a man's business be his own.\"  \"He be up-stair now?\"  \"Yes. There be four room up there for card, and a bath-room. It's an old dwell house. Would Fleming know you?\"  \"No, but of course Wardrop would.\"  A if in answer to my objection, Wardrop appear at that moment. He run down the paint wooden stair and hurry through the room without look to right or leave. The piano keep on, and the men at the table be still engross with their glass and one another. Wardrop be very pale; he bolt into a man at the door, and push him aside without ceremony.  \"You might go up now,\" Hunter say, rise. \"I will see where the young gentleman be make for. Just open the door of the different room up-stair, look around for Fleming, and if any one notice you, ask if Al Hunter be there. That will let you out.\"  He leave me then, and"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "The step have cease, but there be a sound of fumble at one of the shutter below. The catch click twice, a if some thin instrument be be slip underneath to raise it, and once I catch a mutter exclamation.  I draw in my head and, puff my cigar until it be glow, manage by it light to see that it be a quarter to two. When I listen again, the house-breaker have move to another window, and be shake it cautiously.  With Miss Letitia's storey of the pearl fresh in my mind, I felt at once that the thief, find his ten a prize, have come back for more. My first impulse be to go to the head of my bed, where I be accustom to keep a revolver. With the touch of the tall corner post, however, I remember that I be not at home, and that it be not likely there be a weapon in the house.  Finally, after knock over an ornament that shatter on the hearth and sound like the crash of doom, I find on the mantel a heavy brass candlestick, and with it in my hand I step into the gloom of the hallway and felt my way to the stair.  There be no night light; the darkness be total. I find the stair before I expect to, and come within an ace of pitch down, headlong. I have kick off my shoe--a fact which I regret later. Once down the stair I be on more familiar territory. I go at once into the library, which be beneath my room, but the sound at the window have cease. I think I hear step on the walk, go toward the front of the house. I wheel quickly and start for the door, when something strike me a terrific blow on the nose. I reel back and sit down, dizzy and shock. It be only when no second blow follow the first that I realise what have occur.  With my two hand out before me in the blackness, I have grope, one hand on either side of the open door, which of course I have strike violently with my nose. Afterward I find it have bleed considerably, and my collar and tie must have add to my ghastly appearance.  My candlestick have roll under the table, and after crawl around on my hand and knee, I find it. I have lose, I suppose, three or four minute, and I be rag at my awkwardness and stupidity. No one, however, seem to have hear the noise. For all her boast watchfulness, Miss Letitia must have be asleep. I get back into the hall and from there to the din-room. Some one be fumble at the shutter there, and a I look they swing open. It be so dark outside, with the tree and the distance from the street, that only the creak of the shutter tell it have open. I stand in the middle of the room, with one hand firmly clutch my candlestick.  But the window refuse to move. The burglar seem to have no proper tool; he get something under the sash, but it snap, and through the heavy plate-glass I could hear him swear. Then he abruptly leave the window and make for the front of the house.  I blunder in the same direction, my unshod foot strike on project furniture and cause me agony, even through my excitement. When I reach the front door, however, I be amaze to find it unlock, and stand open perhaps an inch. I stop uncertainly. I be in a peculiar position; not even the most ardent admirer of antique brass candlestick indorse them a weapon of offence or defence. But, there seem to be nothing else to do, I open the door quietly and step out into the darkness. Slowly, too--it be a new business for me--I be form a theory of my own. It be a strange one, but it seem to fit the fact a I know them. With the storey Wardrop tell that afternoon come my first glimmer of light.  He be look better than he have when I saw him before, but the news of Mr. Butler's approach death and the manner of her injury affect him strangely. He have see the paper, like Bella, and he turn on me almost fiercely when I enter the library. Margery be in her old position at the window, look out, and I know the despondent droop of her shoulder.  \"Be she conscious?\" Wardrop ask eagerly, indicate the article in the paper.  \"No, not now--at least, it be not likely.\"  He look relieve at that, but only for a moment. Then he begin to pace the room nervously, evidently debate some move. His next action show the development of a resolution, for he push forward two chair for Margery and myself.  \"Sit down, both of you,\" he direct. \"I've get a lot to say, and I want you both to listen. When Margery have hear the whole storey, she will probably despise me for the rest of her life. I can't help it. I've get to tell all I know, and it isn't so much after all. You didn't fool me yesterday, Knox; I know what that doctor be after. But he couldn't make me tell who kill Mr. Fleming, because, before God, I didn't know.\"     \"I have to go back to the night Miss Jane disappear--and that's another thing that have drive me desperate. Will you tell me why I should be suspect of have a hand in that, when she have be a mother to me? If she be dead, she can't exonerate me; if she be live, and we find her, she will tell you what I tell you--that I know nothing of the whole terrible business.\"  \"I be quite certain of that, Wardrop,\" I interpose. \"Besides, I think I have get to the bottom of that mystery.\"  Margery look at me quickly, but I shake my head. It be too early to tell my suspicion.  \"The thing that look black against me be bad enough, but they have nothing to do with Miss Jane. I will have to go back to before the night she--go away, back to the time Mr. Butler be the state treasurer, and your father, Margery, be his cashier.  \"Butler be not a business man. He let too much responsibility lie with his subordinate--and then, accord to the storey, he couldn't do much anyhow, against Schwartz. The cashier be entirely under machine control, and Butler be neglectful. You remember, Knox, the crash, when three bank, rotten to the core, go under, and it be find a large amount of state money have go too. It be Fleming who do it--I be sorry, Margery, but this be no time to mince word. It be Fleming who deposit the money in the wreck bank, know what would happen. When the crash come, Butler's surety, to save themselves, confiscate every dollar he have in the world. Butler go to the penitentiary for six month, on some minor count, and when he get out, after write to Fleming and Schwartz, protest his innocence, and ask for enough out of the fortune they have rob him of to support his wife, he kill himself, at the White Cat.\"  Margery be very pale, but quiet. She sit with her finger lock in her lap, and her eye on Wardrop.  \"It be a bad business,\" Wardrop go on wearily. \"Fleming move into Butler's place a treasurer, and take Lightfoot a his cashier. That keep the lid on. Once or twice, when there be an unexpected call for fund, the treasury be almost empty, and Schwartz carry thing over himself. I go to Plattsburg a Mr. Fleming's private secretary when he become treasurer, and from the first I know thing be even worse than the average state government.  \"Schwartz and Fleming have to hold together; they hat each other, and the feel be treble when Fleming marry Schwartz's divorce wife.\"  Margery look at me with startle, incredulous eye. What she must have see confirm Wardrop's word, and she lean back in her chair, limp and unnerve. But she hear and comprehend every word Wardrop be say.  \"The woman be a very ordinary person"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "Oldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Alton. \"Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I use to know,\" say Holmes to the porter. \"A lawyer, be he not, gray-head, and walk with a limp?\" \"No, sir, this be Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active gentleman, not older than yourself.\" \"Surely you be mistake about his trade?\" \"No, sir! he have use this hotel for many year, and he be very well know to u.\" \"Ah, that settle it. Mr. Oldmore, too; I seem to remember the name. Excuse my curiosity, but often in call upon one friend one find another.\" \"She be an invalid lady, sir. Her husband be once mayor of Gloucester. She always come to u when she be in town.\" \"Thank you; I be afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance. We have establish a most important fact by these question, Watson,\" he continue in a low voice a we go upstairs together. \"We know now that the people who be so interest in our friend have not settle down in his own hotel. That mean that while they be, a we have see, very anxious to watch him, they be equally anxious that he should not see them. Now, this be a most suggestive fact.\" \"What do it suggest?\" \"It suggest--halloa, my dear fellow, what on earth be the matter?\" A we come round the top of the stair we have run up against Sir Henry Baskerville himself. His face be flush with anger, and he hold an old and dusty boot in one of his hand. So furious be he that he be hardly articulate, and when he do speak it be in a much broader and more Western dialect than any which we have hear from him in the morning. \"Seem to me they be play me for a sucker in this hotel,\" he cry. \"They'll find they've start in to monkey with the wrong man unless they be careful. By thunder, if that chap can't find my miss boot there will be trouble. I can take a joke with the best, Mr. Holmes, but they've get a bite over the mark this time.\" \"Still look for your boot?\" \"Yes, sir, and mean to find it.\" \"But, surely, you say that it be a new brown boot?\" \"So it be, sir. And now it's an old black one.\" \"What! you don't mean to say--?\" \"That's just what I do mean to say. I only have three pair in the world--the new brown, the old black, and the patent leather, which I be wear. Last night they take one of my brown one, and today they have sneak one of the black. Well, have you get it? Speak out, man, and don't stand star!\" An agitate German waiter have appear upon the scene. \"No, sir; I have make inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hear no word of it.\" \"Well, either that boot come back before sundown or I'll see the manager and tell him that I go right straight out of this hotel.\" \"It shall be find, sir--I promise you that if you will have a little patience it will be find.\" \"Mind it be, for it's the last thing of mine that I'll lose in this den of thieve. Well, well, Mr. Holmes, you'll excuse my trouble you about such a trifle--\" \"I think it's well worth trouble about.\" \"Why, you look very serious over it.\" \"How do you explain it?\" \"I just don't attempt to explain it. It seem the very maddest, queerest thing that ever happen to me.\" \"The queerest perhaps--\" say Holmes thoughtfully. \"What do you make of it yourself?\" \"Well, I don't profess to understand it yet. This case of yours be very complex, Sir Henry. When take in conjunction with your uncle's death I be not sure that of all the five hundred case of capital importance which I have handle there be one which cut so deep. But we hold several thread in our hand, and the odds be that one or other of them guide u to the truth. We may waste time in follow the wrong one, but sooner or later we must come upon the right.\" We have a pleasant luncheon in which little be say of the business which have bring u together. It be in the private sit-room to which we afterwards repair that Holmes ask Baskerville what be his intention. \"To go to Baskerville Hall.\" \"And when?\" \"At the end of the week.\" \"On the whole,\" say Holmes, \"I think that your decision be a wise one. I have ample evidence that you be be dog in London, and amid the million of this great city it be difficult to discover who these people be or what their object can be. If their intention be evil they might do you a mischief, and we should be powerless to prevent it. You do not know, Dr. Mortimer, that you be follow this morning from my house?\" Dr. Mortimer start violently. \"Follow! By whom?\" \"That, unfortunately, be what I cannot tell you. Have you among your neighbor or acquaintance on Dartmoor any man with a black, full beard?\" \"No--or, let me see--why, yes. Barrymore, Sir Charles's butler, be a man with a full, black beard.\" \"Ha! Where be Barrymore?\" \"He be in charge of the Hall.\" \"We have best ascertain if he be really there, or if by any possibility he might be in London.\" \"How can you do that?\" \"Give me a telegraph form. 'Be all ready for Sir Henry?' That will do. Address to Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall. What be the nearest telegraph-office? Grimpen. Very good, we will send a second wire to the postmaster, Grimpen: 'telegram to Mr. Barrymore to be deliver into his own hand. If absent, please return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel.' That should let u know before even whether Barrymore be at his post in Devonshire or not.\" \"That's so,\" say Baskerville. \"By the way, Dr. Mortimer, who be this Barrymore, anyhow?\" \"He be the son of the old caretaker, who be dead. They have look after the Hall for four generation now. So far a I know, he and his wife be a respectable a couple a any in the county.\" \"At the same time,\" say Baskerville, \"it's clear enough that so long a there be none of the family at the Hall these people have a mighty fine home and nothing to do.\" \"That be true.\" \"Do Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charles's will?\" ask Holmes. \"He and his wife have five hundred pound each.\" \"Ha! Do they know that they would receive this?\" \"Yes; Sir Charles be very fond of talk about the provision of his will.\" \"That be very interest.\" \"I hope,\" say Dr. Mortimer, \"that you do not look with suspicious eye upon everyone who receive a legacy from Sir Charles, for I also have a thousand pound leave to me.\" \"Indeed! And anyone else?\" \"There be many insignificant sum to individual, and a large number of public charity. The residue all go to Sir Henry.\" \"And how much be the residue?\" \"Seven hundred and forty thousand pound.\" Holmes raise his eyebrow in surprise. \"I have no idea that so gigantic a sum be involve,\" say he. \"Sir Charles have the reputation of be rich, but we do not know how very rich he be until we come to examine his security. The total value of the estate be close on to a million.\" \"Dear me! It be a stake for which a man might well play a desperate game. And one more question, Dr. Mortimer. Suppose that anything happen to our young friend here--you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis!--who would inherit the estate?\" \"Since Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles's younger brother die unmarried, the estate would descend to the Desmonds, who be distant cousin. Jam Desmond be an elderly clergyman in Westmoreland.\" \"Thank you. These detail be all of great interest. Have you meet Mr. Jam Desmond?\" \"Yes; he once come down to visit Sir Charles. He be a man of venerable appearance and of saintly life. I remember that he refuse to accept any settlement from Sir Charles, though he press it upon him.\" \"And this man of simple taste would be the"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "Monsieur?\" \"Why be Madame Renauld not here? I send for her a quarter of an hour ago?\" \"She be come up the path now, monsieur, and her son with her.\" \"Good. I only want one at a time, though.\" Marchaud salute and disappear again. A moment later he reappear with Mr. Renauld. \"Here be Madame.\" Giraud come forward with a curt bow. \"This way, madame.\" He lead her across, and then, stand suddenly aside. \"Here be the man. Do you know him?\" And a he speak, his eye, gimlet-like, bore into her face, seek to read her mind, note every indication of her manner. But Mr. Renauld remain perfectly calm--too Nadina shake her head. \"No, no, that be not the way of it. Listen, my friend, to-morrow I go to London.\" \"But your contract here?\" \"I shall be away only one night. And I go incognito, like Royalty. No one will ever know that I have leave France. And why do you think that I go?\" \"Hardly for pleasure at this time of year. January, a detestable foggy month! It must be for profit, eh?\" \"Exactly.\" She rise and stand in front of him, every graceful line of her arrogant with pride. \"You say just now that none of u have anything on the chief. You be wrong. I have. I, a woman, have have the wit and, yes, the courage--for it need courage--to double-cross him. You remember the De Beer diamond?\" \"Yes, I remember. At Kimberley, just before the war break out? I have nothing to do with it, and I never hear the detail, the case be hush up for some reason, be it not? A fine haul too.\" \"A hundred thousand pound worth of stone. Two of u work it--under the 'Colonel's' order, of course. And it be then that I saw my chance. You see, the plan be to substitute some of the De Beer diamond for some sample diamond bring from South America by two young prospector who happen to be in Kimberley at the time. Suspicion be then bind to fall on them.\" \"Very clever,\" interpolate the Count approvingly. \"The 'Colonel' be always clever. Well, I do my part--but I also do one thing which the 'Colonel' have not foresee. I keep back some of the South American stone--one or two be unique and could easily be prove never to have pas through De Beer's hand. With these diamond in my possession, I have the whip-hand of my esteem chief. Once the two young men be clear, his part in the matter be bind to be suspect. I have say nothing all these year, I have be content to know that I have this weapon in reserve, but now matter be different. I want my price--and it will be a big, I might almost say a stagger price.\" \"Extraordinary,\" say the Count. \"And doubtless you carry these diamond about with you everywhere?\" His eye roam gently round the disorder room. Nadina laugh softly. \"You need suppose nothing of the sort. I be not a fool. The diamond be in a safe place where no one will dream of look for them.\" \"I never think you a fool, my dear lady, but may I venture to suggest that you be somewhat foolhardy? The 'Colonel' be not the type of man to take kindly to be blackmail, you know.\" \"I be not afraid of him,\" she laugh. \"There be only one man I have ever fear--and he be dead.\" The man look at her curiously. \"Let u hope that he will not come to life again, then,\" he remark lightly. \"What do you mean?\" cry the dancer sharply. The Count look slightly surprise. \"I only mean that a resurrection would be awkward for you,\" he explain. \"A foolish joke.\" She give a sigh of relief. \"Oh, no, he be dead all right. Kill in the war. He be a man who once--love me.\" \"In South Africa?\" ask the Count negligently. \"Yes, since you ask it, in South Africa.\" \"That be your native country, be it not?\" She nod. Her visitor rise and reach for his hat. \"Well,\" he remark, \"you know your own business best, but, if I be you, I should fear the 'Colonel' far more than any disillusion lover. He be a man whom it be particularly easy to--underestimate.\" She laugh scornfully. \"A if I do not know him after all these year!\" \"I wonder if you do?\" he say softly. \"I very much wonder if you do.\" \"Oh, I be not a fool! And I be not alone in this. The South African mail-boat dock at Southampton to-morrow, and on board her be a man who have come specially from Africa at my request and who have carry out certain order of mine. The 'Colonel' will have not one of u to deal with, but two.\" \"Be that wise?\" \"It be necessary.\" \"You be sure of this man?\" A rather peculiar smile play over the dancer's face. \"I be quite sure of him. He be inefficient, but perfectly trustworthy.\" She pause, and then add in an indifferent tone of voice: \"A a matter of fact, he happen to be my husband.\" Everybody have be at me, right and leave, to write this story from the great (represent by Lord Nasby) to the small (represent by our late maid of all work, Emily, whom I saw when I be last in England. \"Lor', miss, what a beyewtiful book you might make out of it all--just like the picture!\"). I'll admit that I've certain qualification for the task. I be mix up in the affair from the very begin, I be in the thick of it all through, and I be triumphantly \"in at the death.\" Very fortunately, too, the gap that I cannot supply from my own knowledge be amply cover by Sir Eustace Pedler's diary, of which he have kindly beg me to make use. So here go. Anne Beddingfeld start to narrate her adventure. I'd always long for adventure. You see, my life have such a dreadful sameness. My father, Professor Beddingfeld, be one of England's greatest live authority on Primitive Man. He really be a genius--every one admit that. His mind dwell in Palaeolithic time, and the inconvenience of life for him be that his body inhabit the modern world. Papa do not care for modern man--even Neolithic Man he despise a a mere herder of cattle, and he do not rise to enthusiasm until he reach the Mousterian period. Unfortunately one cannot entirely dispense with modern men. One be force to have some kind of truck with butcher and baker and milkman and greengrocer. Therefore, Papa be immerse in the past, Mamma have die when I be a baby, it fell to me to undertake the practical side of live. Frankly, I hate Palaeolithic Man, be he Aurignacian, Mousterian, Chellian, or anything else, and though I type and revise most of Papa's _Neanderthal Man and his Ancestor,_ Neanderthal men themselves fill me with loathe, and I always reflect what a fortunate circumstance it be that they become extinct in remote age. I do not know whether Papa guess my feel on the subject, probably not, and in any case he would not have be interest. The opinion of other people never interest him in the slightest degree. I think it be really a sign of his greatness. In the same way, he live quite detach from the necessity of daily life. He eat what be put before him in an exemplary fashion, but seem mildly pain when the question of pay for it arise. We never seem to have any money. His celebrity be not of the kind that bring in a cash return. Although he be a fellow of almost every important society, and have row of letter after his name, the general public scarcely know of his existence, and his long learn book, though add signally to the sum-total of human knowledge, have no attraction for the mass. Only on one occasion do he leap into the public gaze. He have read a paper before some society on the subject of the young of the chimpanzee. The young of the human race show some anthropoid feature, whereas"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "The _Lusitania_ have be strike by two torpedo in succession and be sink rapidly, while the boat be be launch with all possible speed.

She do not seem afraid, and her grave, steadfast eye look straight ahead. \"I beg your pardon.\" A man's voice beside her make her start and turn. She have notice the speaker more than once amongst the first-class passenger. There have be a hint of mystery about him which have appeal to her imagination. He speak to no one. If anyone speak to him he be quick to rebuff the overture. Also he have a nervous way of look over his shoulder with a swift, suspicious glance. She notice now that he be greatly agitate. There be bead of perspiration on his brow. He be evidently in a state of overmaster fear. And yet he do not strike her a the kind of man who would be afraid to meet death! \"Yes?\" Her grave eye meet his inquiringly. He stand look at her with a kind of desperate irresolution. \"It must be!\" he mutter to himself. \"Yes--it be the only way.\" Then aloud he say abruptly: \"You be an American?\" \"Yes.\" \"A patriotic one?\" The girl flush. \"I guess you've no right to ask such a thing! Of course I be!\" \"Don't be offend. You wouldn't be if you know how much there be at stake. But I've get to trust some one--and it must be a woman.\" \"Why?\" \"Because of 'woman and child first.'\" He look round and lower his voice. \"I'm carry paper--vitally important paper. They may make all the difference to the Ally in the war. You understand? These paper have _get_ to be save! They've more chance with you than with me. Will you take them?\" The girl hold out her hand. \"Wait--I must warn you. There may be a risk--if I've be follow. I don't think I have, but one never know. If so, there will be danger. Have you the nerve to go through with it?\" The girl smile. \"I'll go through with it all right. And I'm real proud to be choose! What be I to do with them afterwards?\" \"Watch the newspaper! I'll advertise in the personal column of the _Time_, begin 'Shipmate.' At the end of three day if there's nothing--well, you'll know I'm down and out.

In answer to a quick command, the girl go forward to take her place in the boat. \"TOMMY, old thing!\" \"Tuppence, old bean!\" The two young people greet each other affectionately, and momentarily block the Dover Street Tube exit in do so. The adjective \"old\" be mislead. Their unite age would certainly not have total forty-five. \"Not see you for simply century,\" continue the young man. \"Where be you off to? Come and chew a bun with me. We're get a bite unpopular here--block the gangway a it be. Let's get out of it.\" The girl assent, they start walk down Dover Street towards Piccadilly. \"Now then,\" say Tommy, \"where shall we go?\" The very faint anxiety which underlay his tone do not escape the astute ear of Miss Prudence Cowley, know to her intimate friend for some mysterious reason a \"Tuppence.\" She pounce at once. \"Tommy, you're stony!\" \"Not a bite of it,\" declare Tommy unconvincingly. \"Roll in cash.\" \"You always be a shock liar,\" say Tuppence severely, \"though you do once persuade Sister Greenbank that the doctor have order you beer a a tonic, but forget to write it on the chart.

The cost of live--ordinary plain, or garden live nowadays be, I assure you, if you do not know----\" \"My dear child,\" interrupt Tuppence, \"there be nothing I do _not_ know about the cost of live. Here we be at Lyons', and we will each of u pay for our own. That's it!\" And Tuppence lead the way upstairs. The place be full, and they wander about look for a table, catch odds and end of conversation a they do so. \"And--do you know, she sit down and _cry_ when I tell her she couldn't have the flat after all.\" \"It be simply a _bargain_, my dear! Just like the one Mabel Lewis bring from Paris----\" \"Funny scrap one do overhear,\" murmur Tommy. \"I pas two Johnny in the street to-day talk about some one call Jane Finn. Do you ever hear such a name?\" But at that moment two elderly lady rise and collect parcel, and Tuppence deftly ensconce herself in one of the vacant seat. Tommy order tea and bun. Tuppence order tea and butter toast. \"And mind the tea come in separate teapot,\" she add severely. Tommy sit down opposite her. His bar head reveal a shock of exquisitely slick-back red hair. His face be pleasantly ugly--nondescript, yet unmistakably the face of a gentleman and a sportsman. His brown suit be well cut, but perilously near the end of it tether. They be an essentially modern-look couple a they sit there. Tuppence have no claim to beauty, but there be character and charm in the elfin line of her little face, with it determine chin and large, wide-apart gray eye that look mistily out from under straight, black brow. She wear a small bright green toque over her black bob hair, and her extremely short and rather shabby skirt reveal a pair of uncommonly dainty ankle. Her appearance present a valiant attempt at smartness. The tea come at last, and Tuppence, rouse herself from a fit of meditation, pour it out. \"Now then,\" say Tommy, take a large bite of bun, \"let's get up-to-date. Remember, I haven't see you since that time in hospital in 1916.\" \"Very well.\" Tuppence help herself liberally to butter toast. \"Abridge biography of Miss Prudence Cowley, fifth daughter of Archdeacon Cowley of Little Missendell, Suffolk.

I come here straight from the Yard to ask you to your face what you have against me.\" \"I have nothing in the world against you, my good man,\" say Holmes. \"On the contrary, I have half a sovereign for you if you will give me a clear answer to my question.\" \"Well, I've have a good day and no mistake,\" say the cabman with a grin. \"What be it you want to ask, sir?\" \"First of all your name and address, in case I want you again.\" \"John Clayton, 3 Turpey Street, the Borough. My cab be out of Shipley's Yard, near Waterloo Station.\" Sherlock Holmes make a note of it. \"Now, Clayton, tell me all about the fare who come and watch this house at ten o'clock this morning and afterwards follow the two gentleman down Regent Street.\" The man look surprise and a little embarrass. \"Why, there's no good my tell you thing, for you seem to know a much a I do already,\" say he. \"The truth be that the gentleman tell me that he be a detective and that I be to say nothing about him to anyone.\" \"My good fellow; this be a very serious business, and you may find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide anything from me. You say that your fare tell you that he be a detective?\" \"Yes, he do.\" \"When do he say this?\" \"When he leave me.\" \"Do he say anything more?\" \"He mention his name.\" Holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me. \"Oh, he mention his name, do he? That be imprudent. What be the name that he mention?\" \"His name,\" say the cabman, \"be Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\" Never have I see my friend more completely take aback than by the cabman's reply. For an instant he sit in silent amazement. Then he burst into a hearty laugh. \"A touch, Watson--an undeniable touch!\" say he. \"I feel a foil a quick and supple a my own. He get home upon me very prettily that time. So his name be Sherlock Holmes, be it?\" \"Yes, sir, that be the gentleman's name.\" \"Excellent! Tell me where you pick him up and all that occur.\" \"He hail me at half-past nine in Trafalgar Square.

Minx then--minx now!\" \"That's it,\" say Tuppence. \"I'm a frightful minx myself.\" \"I believe you,\" say the old gentleman, chuckle, and pinch her ear in high good-humor. Most young woman be terrify of the \"old bear,\" a they term him. Tuppence's pertness delight the old misogynist. Then come the timid archdeacon, a little bewilder by the company in which he find himself, glad that his daughter be consider to have distinguish herself, but unable to help glance at her from time to time with nervous apprehension. But Tuppence behave admirably. She forbear to cross her leg, set a guard upon her tongue, and steadfastly refuse to smoke. Dr. Hall come next, and he be follow by the American Ambassador. \"We might a well sit down,\" say Julius, when he have introduce all his guest to each other. \"Tuppence, will you----\" He indicate the place of honor with a wave of his hand. But Tuppence shake her head. \"No--that's Jane's place! When one think of how she's hold out all these year, she ought to be make the queen of the feast to-night.\" Julius fling her a grateful glance, and Jane come forward shyly to the allot seat. Beautiful a she have seem before, it be a nothing to the loveliness that now go fully adorn. Tuppence have perform her part faithfully. The model gown supply by a famous dressmaker have be entitle \"A tiger lily.\" It be all gold and red and brown, and out of it rise the pure column of the girl's white throat, and the bronze mass of hair that crown her lovely head. There be admiration in every eye, a she take her seat. Soon the supper party be in full swing, and with one accord Tommy be call upon for a full and complete explanation. \"You've be too darn close about the whole business,\" Julius accuse him. \"You let on to me that you be off to the Argentine--though I guess you have your reason for that. The idea of both you and Tuppence cast me for the part of Mr. Brown just tickle me to death!\" \"The idea be not original to them,\" say Mr. Carter gravely. \"It be suggest, and the poison very carefully instill, by a past-master in the art. The paragraph in the New York paper suggest the plan to him, and by mean of it he weave a web that nearly enmesh you fatally.\" \"I never like him,\" say Julius. \"I felt from the first that there be something wrong about him, and I always suspect that it be he who silence Mr. Vandemeyer so appositely. But it wasn't till I hear that the order for Tommy's execution come right on the heel of our interview with him that Sunday that I begin to tumble to the fact that he be the big bug himself.\" \"I never suspect it at all,\" lament Tuppence. \"I've always think I be so much cleverer than Tommy--but he's undoubtedly score over me handsomely.\" Julius agree. \"Tommy's be the good this trip! And, instead of sit there a dumb a a fish, let him banish his blush, and tell u all about it.\" \"Hear! hear!\" \"There's nothing to tell,\" say Tommy, acutely uncomfortable. \"I be an awful mug--right up to the time I find that photograph of Annette, and realize that she be Jane Finn. Then I remember how persistently she have shout out that word 'Marguerite'--and I think of the picture, and--well, that's that. Then of course I go over the whole thing to see where I'd make an as of myself.\" \"Go on,\" say Mr. Carter, a Tommy show sign of take refuge in silence once more. \"That business about Mr. Vandemeyer have worry me when Julius tell me about it. On the face of it, it seem that he or Sir Jam must have do the trick. But I didn't know which. Find that photograph in the drawer, after that story of how it have be get from him by Inspector Brown, make me suspect Julius. Then I remember that it be Sir Jam who have discover the false Jane Finn. In the end, I couldn't make up my mind--and just decide to take no chance either way. I leave a note for Julius, in case he be Mr. Brown, say I be off to the Argentine, and I drop Sir James's letter with the offer of the job by the desk so that he would see it be a genuine stunt. Then I write my letter to Mr. Carter and ring up Sir Jam. Take him into my confidence would be the best thing either way, so I tell him everything except where I believe the paper to be hide. The way he help me to get on the track of Tuppence and Annette almost disarm me, but not quite. I keep my mind open between the two of them. And then I get a bogus note from Tuppence--and I know!\" \"But how?\" Tommy take the note in question from his pocket and pas it round the table. \"It's her handwrite all right, but I know it wasn't from her because of the signature. She'd never spell her name 'twopence,' but anyone who'd never see it write might quite easily do so. Julius _have_ see it--he show me a note of hers to him once--but _Sir Jam hadn't!_ After that everything be plain sail. I send off Albert post-haste to Mr. Carter. I pretend to go away, but double back again. When Julius come burst up in his car, I felt it wasn't part of Mr. Brown's plan--and that there would probably be trouble. Unless Sir Jam be actually catch in the act, so to speak, I know Mr. Carter would never believe it of him on my bare word----\" \"I didn't,\" interpose Mr. Carter ruefully. \"That's why I send the girl off to Sir Jam. I be sure they'd fetch up at the house in Soho sooner or later. I threaten Julius with the revolver, because I want Tuppence to repeat that to Sir Jam, so that he wouldn't worry about u. The moment the girl be out of sight I tell Julius to drive like hell for London, and a we go along I tell him the whole story. We get to the Soho house in plenty of time and meet Mr. Carter outside. After arrange thing with him we go in and hide behind the curtain in the recess. The policeman have order to say, if they be ask, that no one have go into the house. That's all.\" And Tommy come to an abrupt halt. There be silence for a moment. \"By the way,\" say Julius suddenly, \"you're all wrong about that photograph of Jane. It _be_ take from me, but I find it again.\" \"Where?\" cry Tuppence. \"In that little safe on the wall in Mr. Vandemeyer's bedroom.\" \"I know you find something,\" say Tuppence reproachfully. \"To tell you the truth, that's what start me off suspect you. Why didn't you say?\" \"I guess I be a mite suspicious too. It have be get away from me once, and I determine I wouldn't let on I'd get it until a photographer have make a dozen copy of it!\" \"We all keep back something or other,\" say Tuppence thoughtfully. \"I suppose secret service work make you like that!\" In the pause that ensue, Mr. Carter take from his pocket a small shabby brown book. \"Beresford have just say that I would not have believe Sir Jam Peel Edgerton to be guilty unless, so to speak, he be"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "Her feature and figure be those of a woman of thirty, but her hair be shoot with premature gray, and her expression be weary and haggard.

He do not say so, but I can read it from his soothe answer and avert eye. But I have hear, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the danger which encompass me.\" \"I be all attention, madam.\" \"My name be Helen Stoner, and I be live with my stepfather, who be the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon family in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.\" Holmes nod his head. \"The name be familiar to me,\" say he. \"The family be at one time among the richest in England, and the estate extend over the border into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive heir be of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin be eventually complete by a gambler in the day of the Regency. Nothing be leave save a few acre of grind, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which be itself crush under a heavy mortgage. The last squire drag out his existence there, live the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, see that he must adapt himself to the new condition, obtain an advance from a relative, which enable him to take a medical degree and go out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he establish a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, cause by some robbery which have be perpetrate in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escape a capital sentence. A it be, he suffer a long term of imprisonment and afterwards return to England a morose and disappoint man. \"When Dr. Roylott be in India he marry my mother, Mr. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia and I be twin, and we be only two year old at the time of my mother's re-marriage. She have a considerable sum of money--not le than 1000 pound a year--and this she bequeath to Dr. Roylott entirely while we reside with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allow to each of u in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to England my mother die--she be kill eight year ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandon his attempt to establish himself in practice in London and take u to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother have leave be enough for all our want, and there seem to be no obstacle to our happiness. \"But a terrible change come over our stepfather about this time. Instead of make friend and exchange visit with our neighbor, who have at first be overjoy to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom come out save to indulge in ferocious quarrel with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approach to mania have be hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather's case it have, I believe, be intensify by his long residence in the tropic. A series of disgraceful brawl take place, two of which end in the police-court, until at last he become the terror of the village, and the folk would fly at his approach, for he be a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger. \"Last week he hurl the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it be only by pay over all the money which I could gather together that I be able to avert another public exposure. He have no friend at all save the wander gypsy, and he would give these vagabond leave to encamp upon the few acre of bramble-cover land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tent, wander away with them sometimes for week on end. He have a passion also for Indian animal, which be send over to him by a correspondent, and he have at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his ground and be fear by the villager almost a much a their master. \"You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I have no great pleasure in our live. No servant would stay with u, and for a long time we do all the work of the house. She be but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair have already begin to whiten, even a mine have.\" \"Your sister be dead, then?\" \"She die just two year ago, and it be of her death that I wish to speak to you.

She will answer question better if she be hungry. No one have better go near her till then. Be she securely tie up?\" The Dutchman laugh. \"What do you think?\" They both laugh. So do I, under my breath. Then, a the sound seem to betoken that they be about to come out of the room, I beat a hasty retreat. I be just in time. A I reach the head of the stair, I hear the door of the room open, and at the same time the Kafir stir and move. My retreat by the way of the hall door be not to be think of. I retire prudently to the attic, gather my bond round me and lay down again on the floor, in case they should take it into their head to come and look at me. They do not do so, however. After about an hour, I creep down the stair, but the Kafir by the door be awake and hum softly to himself. I be anxious to get out of the house, but I do not quite see how to manage it. In the end I be force to retreat to the attic again. The Kafir be clearly on guard for the night. I remain there patiently all through the sound of early morning preparation. The men breakfast in the hall, I could hear their voice distinctly float up the stair. I be get thoroughly unnerve. How on earth be I to get out of the house? I counsel myself to be patient. A rash move might spoil everything. After breakfast come the sound of Chichester depart. To my intense relief, the Dutchman accompany him. I wait breathlessly. Breakfast be be clear away, the work of the house be be do. At last, the various activity seem to die down. I slip out from my lair once more. Very carefully I creep down the stair. The hall be empty. Like a flash I be across it, have unlatched the door, and be outside in the sunshine. I run down the drive like one posse. Once outside, I resume a normal walk. People star at me curiously, and I do not wonder. My face and clothe must have be cover in dust from roll about in the attic. At last I come to a garage. I go in. \"I have meet with an accident,\" I explain. \"I want a car to take me to Cape Town at once. I must catch the boat to Durban.\" I have not long to wait. Ten minute later I be speed along in the direction of Cape Town. I must know if Chichester be on the boat. Whether to sail on her myself or not, I could not determine, but in the end I decide to do so. Chichester would not know that I have see him in the Villa at Muizenberg. He would doubtless lay further trap for me, but I be forewarn. And he be the man I be after, the man who be seek the diamond on behalf of the mysterious \"Colonel.\" Ala, for my plan! A I arrive at the dock, the _Kilmorden Castle_ be steam out to sea. And I have no mean of know whether Chichester have sail on her or not! I drive to the hotel. There be no one in the lounge that I know. I run upstairs and tap on Suzanne's door. Her voice bid me \"come in.\" When she saw who it be she literally fell on my neck. \"Anne, dear, where have you be? I've be worry to death about you. What have you be do?\" \"Have adventure,\" I reply. \"Episode III of 'the Peril of Pamela.'\" I tell her the whole story. She give vent to a deep sigh when I finish. \"Why do these thing always happen to you?\" she demand plaintively. \"Why do no one gag me and bind me hand and foot?\" \"You wouldn't like it if they do,\" I assure her. \"To tell you the truth, I'm not nearly so keen on have adventure myself a I be. A little of that sort of thing go a long way.\" Suzanne seem unconvinced. An hour or two of gag and bind would have change her view quickly enough. Suzanne like thrill, but she hat be uncomfortable. \"And what be we all do now?\" she ask. \"I don't quite know,\" I say thoughtfully. \"You still go to Rhodesia, of course, to keep an eye on Pagett-- \"And you?\" That be just my difficulty. Have Chichester go on the _Kilmorden,_ or have he not? Do he mean to carry out his original plan of go to Durban? The hour of his leave Muizenberg seem to point to an affirmative answer to both question. In that case, I might go to Durban by train. I fancy that I should get there before the boat. On the other hand, if the news of my escape be wire to Chichester, and also the information that I have leave Cape Town for Durban, nothing be simpler for him than to leave the boat at either Port Elizabeth or East London and so give me the slip completely. It be rather a knotty problem. \"We'll inquire about train to Durban anyway,\" I say. \"And it's not too late for morning tea,\" say Suzanne. \"We'll have it in the lounge.\" The Durban train leave at 8.15 that even, so they tell me at the office. For the moment I postpone decision and join Suzanne for somewhat belated \"eleven-o'clock tea.\" \"Do you feel that you would really recognize Chichester again--in any other disguise, I mean?\" ask Suzanne. I shake my head ruefully. \"I certainly didn't recognize him a the stewardess, and never should have but for your draw.\" \"The man's a professional actor, I'm sure of it,\" say Suzanne thoughtfully. \"His make-up be perfectly marvelous. He might come off the boat a a navvy or something, and you'd never spot him.\" \"You're very cheer,\" I say. At that minute, Colonel Race step in through the window and come and join u. \"What be Sir Eustace do?\" ask Suzanne. \"I haven't see him about to-day.\" Rather an odd expression pas over the Colonel's face. \"He's get a little trouble of his own to attend to which be keep him busy.\" \"Tell u about it.\" \"I mustn't tell tale out of school.\" \"Tell u something--even if you have to invent it for our special benefit.\" \"Well, what would you say to the famous 'Man in the Brown Suit' have make the voyage with u?\" _\"What? \"_ I felt the color die out of my face and then surge back again. Fortunately Colonel Race be not look at me. \"It's a fact, I believe. Every port watch for him and he bamboozle Pedler into bring him out a his secretary!\" \"Not Mr. Pagett?\" \"Oh, not Pagett--the other fellow. Rayburn, he call himself.\" \"Have they arrest him?\" ask Suzanne. Under the table she give my hand a reassure squeeze. I wait breathlessly for an answer. \"He seem to have disappear into thin air.\" \"How do Sir Eustace take it?\" \"Regard it a a personal insult offer him by Fate.\" An opportunity of hear Sir Eustace's view on the matter present itself later in the day. We be awaken from a refresh afternoon nap by a page-boy with a note. In touch term it request the pleasure of our company at tea in his sit-room. The poor man be indeed in a pitiable state. He pour out his trouble to u, encourage by Suzanne's sympathetic murmur. (She do that sort of thing very well.) \"First a perfectly strange woman have the impertinence to get herself murder in my house--on purpose to annoy me, I do believe. Why my house?

My stepfather learn of the engagement when my sister return and offer no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which have be fix for the wed, the terrible event occur which have deprive me of my only companion.\" Sherlock Holmes have be lean back in his chair with his eye close and his head sink in a cushion, but he half open his lid now and glance across at his visitor. \"Pray be precise a to detail,\" say he. \"It be easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time be sear into my memory. The manor-house be, a I have already say, very old, and only one wing be now inhabit. The bedroom in this wing be on the grind floor, the sit-room be in the central block of the build. Of these bedroom the first be Dr. Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third my own. There be no communication between them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?\" \"Perfectly so.\" \"The window of the three room open out upon the lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott have go to his room early, though we know that he have not retire to rest, for my sister be trouble by the smell of the strong Indian cigar which it be his custom to smoke. She leave her room, therefore, and come into mine, where she sit for some time, chat about her approach wed. At eleven o'clock she rise to leave me, but she pause at the door and look back. \"'tell me, Helen,' say she, 'have you ever hear anyone whistle in the dead of the night?' \"'Never,' say I. \"'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?' \"'Certainly not. But why?' \"'Because during the last few night I have always, about three in the morning, hear a low, clear whistle. I be a light sleeper, and it have awaken me. I cannot tell where it come from--perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I think that I would just ask you whether you have hear it.' \"'No, I have not. It must be those wretched gypsy in the plantation.' \"'Very likely. And yet if it be on the lawn, I wonder that you do not hear it also.' \"'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.' \"'Well, it be of no great consequence, at any rate.' She smile back at me, close my door, and a few moment later I hear her key turn in the lock.\" \"Indeed,\" say Holmes. \"Be it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?\" \"Always.\" \"And why?\" \"I think that I mention to you that the doctor keep a cheetah and a baboon. We have no feel of security unless our door be lock.\" \"Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.\" \"I could not sleep that night. A vague feel of impend misfortune impress me. My sister and I, you will recollect, be twin, and you know how subtle be the link which bind two soul which be so closely ally. It be a wild night. The wind be howl outside, and the rain be beat and splash against the window. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrify woman. I know that it be my sister's voice. I spring from my bed, wrap a shawl round me, and rush into the corridor. A I open my door I seem to hear a low whistle, such a my sister describe, and a few moment later a clang sound, a if a mass of metal have fall. A I run down the passage, my sister's door be unlock, and revolve slowly upon it hinge. I star at it horror-stricken, not know what be about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the open, her face blanch with terror, her hand grope for help, her whole figure sway to and fro like that of a drunkard. I run to her and throw my arm round her, but at that moment her knee seem to give way and she fell to the grind. She writhe a one who be in terrible pain, and her limb be dreadfully convulse. At first I think that she have not recognize me, but a I bend over her she suddenly shriek out in a voice which I shall never forget, 'Oh, my God! Helen! It be the band! The speckle band!' There be something else which she would fain have say, and she stab with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion seize her and choke her word. I rush out, call loudly for my stepfather, and I meet him hasten from his room in his dress-gown. When he reach my sister's side she be unconscious, and though he pour brandy down her throat and send for medical aid from the village, all effort be in vain, for she slowly sink and die without have recover her consciousness. Such be the dreadful end of my beloved sister.\" \"One moment,\" say Holmes, \"be you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? Could you swear to it?\" \"That be what the county coroner ask me at the inquiry. It be my strong impression that I hear it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creak of an old house, I may possibly have be deceive.\" \"Be your sister dress?\" \"No, she be in her night-dress. In her right hand be find the char stump of a match, and in her leave a match-box.\" \"Show that she have strike a light and look about her when the alarm take place. That be important. And what conclusion do the coroner come to?\" \"He investigate the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott's conduct have long be notorious in the county, but he be unable to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence show that the door have be fasten upon the inner side, and the window be block by old-fashion shutter with broad iron bar, which be secure every night. The wall be carefully sound, and be show to be quite solid all round, and the floor be also thoroughly examine, with the same result. The chimney be wide, but be bar up by four large staple. It be certain, therefore, that my sister be quite alone when she meet her end. Besides, there be no mark of any violence upon her.\" \"How about poison?\" \"The doctor examine her for it, but without success.\" \"What do you think that this unfortunate lady die of, then?\" \"It be my belief that she die of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it be that frighten her I cannot imagine.\" \"Be there gypsy in the plantation at the time?\" \"Yes, there be nearly always some there.\" \"Ah, and what do you gather from this allusion to a band--a speckle band?\" \"Sometimes I have think that it be merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have refer to some band of people, perhaps to these very gypsy in the plantation. I do not know whether the spot handkerchief which so many of them wear over their head might have suggest the strange adjective which she use.\" Holmes shake his head like a man who be far from be satisfy. \"These be very deep water,\" say he; \"pray go on with your narrative.\" \"Two year have pas since then, and my life have be until lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have know for many year, have do me the honor to ask my hand in marriage. \"Have you any objection to my look at your register?\" say Holmes. \"Not in the least.\" The book show that two name have be add after that of Baskerville. One be Theophilus Johnson"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "Every word I say be the absolute truth, and how you use it be a matter of no consequence to me.\" With these word, Jefferson Hope lean back in his chair and begin the follow remarkable statement. He speak in a calm and methodical manner, a though the event which he narrate be commonplace enough. I can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoin account, for I have have access to Lestrade's note-book, in which the prisoner's word be take down exactly a they be utter. \"It don't much matter to you why I hat these men,\" he say; \"it's enough that they be guilty of the death of two human be--a father and a daughter--and that they have, therefore, forfeit their own live. After the lapse of time that have pas since their crime, it be impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court. I know of their guilt though, and I determine that I should be judge, jury, and executioner all roll into one. You'd have do the same, if you have any manhood in you, if you have be in my place. \"That girl that I speak of be to have marry me twenty year ago. She be force into marry that same Drebber, and break her heart over it. I take the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vow that his die eye should rest upon that very ring, and that his last thought should be of the crime for which he be punish. I have carry it about with me, and have follow him and his accomplice over two continent until I catch them. They think to tire me out, but they could not do it. If I die to-morrow, a be likely enough, I die know that my work in this world be do, and well do. They have perish, and by my hand. There be nothing leave for me to hope for, or to desire. \"They be rich and I be poor, so that it be no easy matter for me to follow them. When I get to London my pocket be about empty, and I find that I must turn my hand to something for my live. Drive and rid be a natural to me a walk, so I apply at a cabowner's office, and soon get employment. I be to bring a certain sum a week to the owner, and whatever be over that I might keep for myself. There be seldom much over, but I manage to scrape along somehow. The hardest job be to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the maze that ever be contrive, this city be the most confuse. I have a map beside me though, and when once I have spot the principal hotel and station, I get on pretty well. \"It be some time before I find out where my two gentleman be live; but I inquire and inquire until at last I drop across them. They be at a board-house at Camberwell, over on the other side of the river. When once I find them out I know that I have them at my mercy. I have grow my beard, and there be no chance of their recognize me. I would dog them and follow them until I saw my opportunity. I be determine that they should not escape me again. \"They be very near do it for all that. Go where they would about London, I be always at their heel. Sometimes I follow them on my cab, and sometimes on foot, but the former be the best, for then they could not get away from me. It be only early in the morning or late at night that I could earn anything, so that I begin to get behind hand with my employer. I do not mind that, however, a long a I could lay my hand upon the men I want. \"They be very cunning, though. They must have think that there be some chance of their be follow, for they would never go out alone, and never after nightfall. During two week I drive behind them every day, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself be drink half the time, but Stangerson be not to be catch nap. I watch them late and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I be not discourage, for something tell me that the hour have almost come. My only fear be that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon and leave my work undo. \"At last, one even I be drive up and down Torquay Terrace, a the street be call in which they board, when I saw a cab drive up to their door. Presently some luggage be bring out, and after a time Drebber and Stangerson follow it, and drive off. I whip up my horse and keep within sight of them, feel very ill at ease, for I fear that they be go to shift their quarter. At Euston Station they get out, and I leave a boy to hold my horse, and follow them on to the platform. I hear them ask for the Liverpool train, and the guard answer that one have just go and there would not be another for some hour. Stangerson seem to be put out at that, but Drebber be rather please than otherwise. I get so close to them in the bustle that I could hear every word that pas between them. Drebber say that he have a little business of his own to do, and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrate with him, and remind him that they have resolve to stick together. Drebber answer that the matter be a delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch what Stangerson say to that, but the other burst out swear, and remind him that he be nothing more than his pay servant, and that he must not presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary give it up a a bad job, and simply bargain with him that if he miss the last train he should rejoin him at Halliday's Private Hotel; to which Drebber answer that he would be back on the platform before eleven, and make his way out of the station. \"The moment for which I have wait so long have at last come. I have my enemy within my power. Together they could protect each other, but singly they be at my mercy. I do not act, however, with undue precipitation. My plan be already form. There be no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender have time to realize who it be that strike him, and why retribution have come upon him. I have my plan arrange by which I should have the opportunity of make the man who have wrong me understand that his old sin have find him out. It chance that some day before a gentleman who have be engage in look over some house in the Brixton Road have drop the key of one of them in my carriage. It be claim that same even, and return; but in the interval I have take a mold of it, and have a duplicate construct. By mean of this I have access to at least one spot in this great city where I could rely upon be free from interruption. How to get Drebber to that house be the difficult problem which I have now to solve. \"He walk down the road and go into one or two liquor shop, stay for nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he come out he stagger in his walk, and be evidently pretty well on. There be a hansom just in front of me, and he hail it. I follow it so close that the nose of my horse be within a yard of his driver the whole way. We rattle across Waterloo Bridge and through mile of street, until, to my astonishment, we find ourselves back in the Terrace in which he have board. I could not imagine what his intention be in return there; but I go on and pull up my cab a hundred"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "You'd better wash those cup yourself, Jane,\" she say. \"I don't see any sense anyhow in get out the best china unless there's real company. Besides, I'm go to talk business.\"  Poor, meek, spiritless Miss Jane! The situation be absurd in spite of it pathos. She confide to me once that never in her sixty-five year of life have she buy herself a gown, or choose the dinner. She be snub with painstaking perseverance, and send out of the room when subject require frank handle be under discussion. She be a unsophisticated a a child of ten, a unworldly a a baby, a--well, poor Miss Jane, again.  When the door have close behind her, Miss Letitia listen for a moment, get up suddenly and cross the room with amaze swiftness for her year, pounce on the knob and throw it open again. But the passage be empty; Miss Jane's slim little figure be disappear into the kitchen. The older sister watch her out of sight, and then return to her sofa without deign explanation.  \"I didn't want to see you about the will, Mr. Knox,\" she begin without prelude. \"The will can wait. I ain't go to die just yet--not if I know anything. But although I think you'd look a heap better and more responsible if you wear some hair on your face, still in most thing I think you're a man of sense. And you're not too young. That's why I didn't send for Harry Wardrop; he's too young.\"  I wince at that. Miss Letitia lean forward and put her bony hand on my knee.  \"I've be rob,\" she announce in a half whisper, and straighten to watch the effect of her word.  \"Indeed!\" I say, properly thunderstruck. I _be_ surprise. I have always believe that only the use of the fourth dimension in space would enable any one, not desire, to gain access to the Maitland house. \"Of money?\"  \"Not money, although I have a good bite in the house.\" This also I know. It be say of Miss Letitia that when money come into her possession it go out of circulation.  \"Not--the pearl?\" I ask.  She answer my question with another.  \"When you have those pearl appraise for me at the jeweller last year, how many be there?\"  \"Not quite one hundred. I think--yes, ninety-eight.\"  \"Exactly,\" she corroborate, in triumph. \"They belong to my mother. Margery's mother get some of them. That's a good many year ago, young man. They be worth more than they be then--a great deal more.\"  \"Twenty-two thousand dollar,\" I repeat. \"You remember, Miss Letitia, that I protest vigorously at the time against your keep them in the house.\"  Miss Letitia ignore this, but before she go on she repeat again her cat-like pounce at the door, only to find the hall empty a before. This time when she sit down it be knee to knee with me.  \"Yesterday morning,\" she say gravely, \"I get down the box; they have always be keep in the small safe in the top of my closet. When Jane find a picture of my niece, Margery Fleming, in Harry's room, I think it likely there be some truth in the gossip Jane hear about the two, and--if there be go to be a wed--why, the pearl be to go to Margery anyhow. But--I find the door of the safe unlock and a little bite open--and ten of the pearl be go!\"  \"Go!\" I echo. \"Ten of them! Why, it's ridiculous! If ten, why not the whole ninety-eight?\"  \"How do I know?\" she reply with asperity. \"That's what I keep a lawyer for: that's why I send for you.\"  For the second time in two day I protest the same thing.  \"But you need a detective,\" I cry. \"If you can find the thief I will be glad to send him where he ought to be, but I couldn't find him.\"  \"I will not have the police,\" she persist inflexibly. \"They will come around ask impertinent question, and tell the newspaper that a foolish old woman have get what she deserve.\"  \"Then you be go to send them to a bank?\"  \"You have le sense than I think,\" she snap. \"I be go to leave them where they be, and watch. Whoever take the ten will be back for more, mark my word.\"  \"I don't advise it,\" I say decidedly. \"You have most of them now, and you might easily lose them all; not only that, but it be not safe for you or your sister.\"  \"Stuff and nonsense!\" the old lady say, with spirit. \"A for Jane, she doesn't even know they be go. I know who do it. It be the new housemaid, Bella Mackenzie. Nobody else could get in. I lock up the house myself at night, and I'm in the habit of do a pretty thorough job of it. They go in the last three week, for I count them Saturday three week ago myself. The only person in the house in that time, except ourselves, be Harry, Bella and Hepsibah, who's be here for forty year and wouldn't know a pearl from a pickle onion.\"  \"Then--what do you want me to do?\" I ask. \"Have Bella arrest and her trunk search?\"  I felt myself shrink in the old lady's esteem every minute.  \"Her trunk!\" she say scornfully. \"I turn it inside out this morning, pretend I think she be steal the laundry soap. Like a not she have them bury in the vegetable garden. What I want you to do be to stay here for three or four night, to be on hand. When I catch the thief, I want my lawyer right by.\"  It end by my consent, of course. Miss Letitia be seldom refuse. I telephone to Fred that I would not be home, listen for voice and decide Margery Fleming have go to bed. Miss Jane light me to the door of the guest room, and saw that everything be comfortable. Her thin grey curl bob a she examine the water pitcher, saw to the towel, and felt the bed linen for dampness. At the door she stop and turn around timidly.  \"Have--have anything happen to disturb my sister?\" she ask. \"She--have be almost irritable all day.\"  Almost!  \"She be worry about her colour orphan,\" I evade. \"She do not approve of firework for them on the fourth of July.\"  Miss Jane be satisfy. I watch her little, old, black-rob figure go lightly down the hall. Then I bolt the door, open all the window, and proceed to a surreptitious smoke.      The window be wide open, it be not long before a great moth come whir in. He hurl himself at the light and then, dazzle and sing, begin to beat with noisy thump against the barrier of the ceiling. Find no egress there, he be back at the lamp again, whirl in dizzy circle until at last, wear out, he drop to the table, where he lay on his back, kick impotently.  The room begin to fill with tiny wing creature that fling themselves headlong to destruction, so I put out the light and sit down near the window, with my cigar and my thought.  Miss Letitia's trouble I dismiss shortly. While it be odd that only ten pearl should have be take, still--in every other way it bore the mark of an ordinary theft. The thief might have think that by leave the majority of the gem he could postpone discovery indefinitely. But the Fleming case be of a different order. Take by itself, Fleming's disappearance could have be easily account for. There must be time in the live of all unscrupulous individual when they feel the need of retire temporarily from the public eye. But the intrusion into the Fleming home, the ransack desk and the break money drawer--most of all, the bite of paper with eleven twenty-two on it--here be a hurdle my legal mind refuse to take.  I have finish my second cigar, and be grow more and more wakeful, when I hear a footstep on the path around the house. It be black outside; when I look out, a I do cautiously, I could not see even the grey-white of"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "So do I. And yet the future seem curiously unreal.

I hat leave Africa. When I come back to it, would it be the same thing? Would it ever be the same thing again? And then I be startle by an authoritative rap on the shutter. I spring up. Harry be on the _stoep_ outside. \"Put some clothe on, Anne, and come out. I want to speak to you.\" I huddle on a few garment, and step out into the cool night air--still and scent, with it velvety feel. Harry beckon me out of earshot of the house. His face look pale and determine and his eye be blaze. \"Anne, do you remember say to me once that woman enjoy do the thing they dislike for the sake of some one they like?\" \"Yes,\" I say, wonder what be come. He catch me in his arm. \"Anne, come away with me--now--to-night. Back to Rhodesia--back to the island. I can't stand all this tomfoolery. I can't wait for you any longer.\" I disengage myself a minute. \"And what about my French frock?\" I lament mockingly. To this day Harry never know when I'm in earnest and when I'm only tease him. \"Damn your French frock. Do you think I want to put frock on you? I'm a damn sight more likely to want to tear them off you. I'm not go to let you go, do you hear? You're my woman. If I let you go away, I may lose you. I'm never sure of you. You're come with me now--to-night--and damn everybody.\" He hold me to him, kiss me until I could hardly breathe. \"I can't do without you any longer, Anne. I can't indeed. I hate all this money. Let Race have it. Come on. Let's go.\" \"My toothbrush?\" I demur. \"You can buy one. I know I'm a lunatic, but for God's sake, _come! \"_ He stalk off at a furious pace. I follow him a meekly a the Barotsi woman I have observe at the Fall. Only I wasn't carry a fry-pan on my head. He walk so fast that it be very difficult to keep up with him. \"Harry,\" I say at last, in a meek voice, \"be we go to walk all the way to Rhodesia?\" He turn suddenly and with a great shout of laughter gather me up in his arm. \"I'm mad, sweetheart, I know it. But I do love you so.\" \"We're a couple of lunatic. And, oh, Harry, you never ask me, but I'm not make a sacrifice at all! I _want_ to come!\" That be two year ago. We still live on the island.

All the time we've be talk Paris and frock I felt that it wasn't a bite real--that you'd vanish into the blue some day to be marry over the tongs in the good old gipsy fashion. But you _be_ a couple of lunatic! This idea of renounce a vast fortune be absurd. Colonel Race want to argue the matter, but I have persuade him to leave the argument to time. He can administer the estate for Harry--and none better. Because, after all, honeymoon don't last forever--you're not here, Anne, so I can safely say that without have you fly out at me like a little wild-cat--Love in the wilderness will last a good while, but one day you will suddenly begin to dream of house in Park Lane, sumptuous fur, Paris frock, the largest thing in motor and the latest thing in perambulator, French maid and Norland nurse! Oh, yes, you will! But have your honeymoon, dear lunatic, and let it be a long one. And think of me sometimes, comfortably put on weight amidst the fleshpots! Your love friend, Suzanne Blair. P.S.--I be send you an assortment of fry-pan a a wed present, and an enormous _terrine_ of _pate de foie gras_ to remind you of me. There be another letter that I sometimes read. It come a good while after the other and be accompany by a bulky packet. It appear to be write from somewhere in Bolivia. My dear Anne Beddingfeld, I can't resist write to you, not so much for the pleasure it give me to write, a for the enormous pleasure I know it will give you to hear from me. Our friend Race wasn't quite a clever a he think himself, be he? I think I shall appoint you my literary executor. I'm send you my diary. There's nothing in it that would interest Race and his crowd, but I fancy that there be passage in it which may amuse you. Make use of it in any way you like. I suggest an article for the _Daily Budget,_ \"Criminal I have meet.\" I only stipulate that I shall be the central figure. By this \"Well, _mon ami_, a good deal you can guess for yourself. Of course you realize that, now Mr. Inglethorp be out of it, the whole position be greatly change. We be face to face with an entirely new problem. We know now that there be one person who do not buy the poison. We have clear away the manufacture clue. Now for the real one. I have ascertain that anyone in the household, with the exception of Mr. Cavendish, who be play tennis with you, could have personate Mr. Inglethorp on Monday even. In the same way, we have his statement that he put the coffee down in the hall. No one take much notice of that at the inquest--but now it have a very different significance. We must find out who do take that coffee to Mr. Inglethorp eventually, or who pas through the hall whilst it be stand there. From your account, there be only two people whom we can positively say do not go near the coffee--Mr. Cavendish, and Mademoiselle Cynthia.\" \"Yes, that be so.\" I felt an inexpressible lighten of the heart. Mary Cavendish could certainly not rest under suspicion. \"In clear Alfred Inglethorp,\" continue Poirot, \"I have be oblige to show my hand sooner than I intend. A long a I might be think to be pursue him, the criminal would be off his guard. Now, he will be doubly careful. Yes--doubly careful.\" He turn to me abruptly. \"Tell me, Hastings, you yourself--have you no suspicion of anybody?\" I hesitate. To tell the truth, an idea, wild and extravagant in itself, have once or twice that morning flash through my brain. I have reject it a absurd, nevertheless it persist. \"You couldn't call it a suspicion,\" I murmur. \"It's so utterly foolish.\" \"Come now,\" urge Poirot encouragingly. \"Do not fear. Speak your mind. You should always pay attention to your instinct.\" \"Well then,\" I blurt out, \"it's absurd--but I suspect Miss Howard of not tell all she know!\" \"Miss Howard?\" \"Yes--you'll laugh at me-- \"Not at all. Why should I?\" \"I can't help feel,\" I continue blunderingly; \"that we've rather leave her out of the possible suspect, simply on the strength of her have be away from the place. But, after all, she be only fifteen mile away. A car would do it in half an hour. Can we say positively that she be away from Style on the night of the murder?\" \"Yes, my friend,\" say Poirot unexpectedly, \"we can. One of my first action be to ring up the hospital where she be work.\" \"Well?\" \"Well, I learn that Miss Howard have be on afternoon duty on Tuesday, and that--a convoy come in unexpectedly--she have kindly offer to remain on night duty, which offer be gratefully accept. That dispose of that.\" \"Oh!\" I say, rather nonplus. \"Really,\" I continue, \"it's her extraordinary vehemence against Inglethorp that start me off suspect her.

In fact, for a moment I meditate run after the young man and inform him that my father have change his mind and would send the article in question.

The phrase alone date him hopelessly. No self-respect female have have a \"neat little waist\" since I be in my cradle.

There be the Kinema too, with a weekly episode of \"The Peril of Pamela.\" Pamela be a magnificent young woman. Nothing daunt her. She fell out of airplane, adventure in submarine, climb skyscraper and creep about in the Underworld without turn a hair. She be not really clever, the Master Criminal of the Underworld catch her each time, but a he seem loath to knock her on the head in a simple way, and always doom her to death in a sewer-gas chamber or by some new and marvelous mean, the hero be always able to rescue her at the begin of the follow week's episode.

And yet, though I do not suspect it, every moment be bring adventure nearer to me. It be possible that there be many people in the world who have never hear of the find of an antique skull at the Break Hill Mine in Northern Rhodesia. I come down one morning to find Papa excite to the point of apoplexy. He pour out the whole story to me. \"You understand, Anne? There be undoubtedly certain resemblance to the Java skull, but superficial--superficial only. No, here we have what I have always maintain--the ancestral form of the Neanderthal race. You grant that the Gibraltar skull be the most primitive of the Neanderthal skull find? Why? The cradle of the race be in Africa. They pas to Europe-- \"Not marmalade on kipper, papa,\" I say hastily, arrest my parent's absent-mind hand. \"Yes, you be say?\" \"They pas to Europe on-- Here he break down with a bad fit of choke, the result of an immoderate mouthful of kipper-bone. \"But we must start at once,\" he declare, a he rise to his foot at the conclusion of the meal. \"There be no time to be lose. We must be on the spot--there be doubtless incalculable find to be find in the neighborhood. I shall be interest to note whether the implement be typical of the Mousterian period--there will be the remain of the primitive ox, I should say, but not those of the wooly rhinoceros. Yes, a little army will be start soon. We must get ahead of them. You will write to Cook's to-day, Anne?\" \"What about money, papa?\" I hint delicately. He turn a reproachful eye upon me. \"Your point of view always depress me, my child. We must not be sordid. No, no, in the cause of science one must not be sordid.\" \"I feel Cook's might be sordid, papa.\" Papa look pain. \"My dear Anne, you will pay them in ready money.\" \"I haven't get any ready money.\" Papa look thoroughly exasperate. \"My child, I really cannot be bother with these vulgar money detail. The bank--I have something from the Manager yesterday, say I have twenty-seven pound.\" \"That's your overdraft, I fancy.\" \"Ah, I have it! Write to my publisher.\" I acquiesce doubtfully, Papa's book bring in more glory than money. I like the idea of go to Rhodesia immensely. \"Stern silent men,\" I murmur to myself in an ecstasy. Then something in my parent's appearance strike me a unusual. \"You have odd boot on, papa,\" I say. \"Take off the brown one and put on the other black one. And don't forget your muffler. It's a very cold day.\" In a few minute Papa stalk off, correctly boot and well mufflered. He return late that even, and, to my dismay, I saw his muffler and overcoat be miss. \"Dear me, Anne, you be quite right. I take them off to go into the cavern. One get so dirty there.\" I nod feelingly, remember an occasion when Papa have return literally plaster from head to foot with rich Pleiocene clay. Our principal reason for settle in Little Hampsly have be the neighborhood of Hampsly Cavern, a bury cave rich in deposit of the Aurignacian culture. We have a tiny Museum in the village, and the curator and Papa spend most of their day mess about underground and bring to light portion of wooly rhinoceros and cave bear. Papa cough badly all the even, and the follow morning I saw he have a temperature and send for the doctor. Poor Papa, he never have a chance. It be double pneumonia. He die four day later. Every one be very kind to me. Daze a I be, I appreciate that. I felt no overwhelm grief. Papa have never love me, I know that well enough. If he have, I might have love him in return. No, there have not be love between u, but we have belong together, and I have look after him, and have secretly admire his learn and his uncompromising devotion to science. And it hurt me that Papa should have die just when the interest of life be at it height for him. I should have felt happier if I could have bury him in a cave, with paint of reindeer and flint implement, but the force of public opinion constrain a neat tomb (with marble slab) in our hideous local churchyard. The vicar's consolation, though well mean, do not console me in the least. It take some time to dawn upon me that the thing I have always long for--freedom--be at last mine. I be an orphan, and practically penniless, but free. At the same time I realize the extraordinary kindness of all these good people. The vicar do his best to persuade me that his wife be in urgent need of a companion help"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "That be so.

But to you, who know the truth, I propose to read certain passage which will throw some light on the extraordinary mentality of this great man.\" He open the book, and turn the thin page. \"... It be madness to keep this book. I know that. It be documentary evidence against me. But I have never shrink from take risk. And I feel an urgent need for self-expression.... The book will only be take from my dead body.... \"... From an early age I realize that I have exceptional ability. Only a fool underestimate his capability.

When I be a boy I hear a famous murder trial. I be deeply impress by the power and eloquence of the counsel for the defense. For the first time I entertain the idea of take my talent to that particular market.... Then I study the criminal in the dock.... The man be a fool--he have be incredibly, unbelievably stupid. Even the eloquence of his counsel be hardly likely to save him. I felt an immeasurable contempt for him.... Then it occur to me that the criminal standard be a low one. It be the wastrel, the failure, the general riff-raff of civilization who drift into crime.... Strange that men of brain have never realize it extraordinary opportunity.... I play with the idea.... What a magnificent field--what unlimited possibility! It make my brain reel.... \"... I read standard work on crime and criminal. They all confirm my opinion. Degeneracy, disease--never the deliberate embrace of a career by a far-see man. Then I consider. Suppose my utmost ambition be realize--that I be call to the bar, and rise to the height of my profession? That I enter politics--say, even, that I become Prime Minister of England? What then? Be that power? Hamper at every turn by my colleague, fetter by the democratic system of which I should be the mere figurehead! No--the power I dream of be absolute! An autocrat! A dictator! And such power could only be obtain by work outside the law. To play on the weakness of human nature, then on the weakness of nation--to get together and control a vast organization, and finally to overthrow the exist order, and rule!

Decidedly you have the heart of a Turk, Hastings! You should establish a harem!\" \"It's all very well to rag me. Mademoiselle Daubreuil be a very beautiful girl, and I do admire her immensely--I don't mind admit it. The other's nothing--don't suppose I shall ever see her again. She be quite amuse to talk to just for a railway journey, but she's not the kind of girl I should ever get keen on.\" \"Why?\" \"Well--it sound snobbish perhaps--but she's not a lady, not in any sense of the word.\" Poirot nod thoughtfully. There be le raillery in his voice a he ask: \"You believe, then, in birth and breed?\" \"I may be old-fashion, but I certainly don't believe in marry out of one's class. It never answer.\" \"I agree with you, _mon ami___. Ninety-nine time out of a hundred, it be a you say. But there be always the hundredth time! Still, that do not arise, a you do not propose to see the lady again.\" His last word be almost a question, and I be aware of the sharpness with which he dart a glance at me. And before my eye, writ large in letter of fire, I saw the word \"Hotel du Phare,\" and I hear again her voice say \"Come and look me up\" and my own answer with _empressement___: \"I will.\" Well, what of it? I have mean to go at the time. But since then, I have have time to reflect. I do not like the girl. Think it over in cold blood, I come definitely to the conclusion that I dislike her intensely. I have get haul over the coal for foolishly gratify her morbid curiosity, and I have not the least wish to see her again. I answer Poirot lightly enough. \"She ask me to look her up, but of course I shan't.\" \"Why 'of course'?\" \"Well--I don't want to.\" \"I see.\" He study me attentively for some minute. \"Yes. I see very well. And you be wise. Stick to what you have say.\" \"That seem to be your invariable advice,\" I remark, rather pique. \"Ah, my friend, have faith in Papa Poirot. Some day, if you permit, I will arrange you a marriage of great suitability.\" \"Thank you,\" I say laugh, \"but the prospect leave me cold.\" Poirot sigh and shake his head. \"_Le Anglais!___\" he murmur. \"No method--absolutely none whatever. They leave all to chance!\" He frown, and alter the position of the salt cellar. \"Mademoiselle Cinderella be stay at the Hotel d'angleterre you tell me, do you not?\" \"No. Hotel du Phare.\" \"True, I forget.\" A moment's misgive shoot across my mind. Surely I have never mention any hotel to Poirot. I look across at him, and felt reassure. He be cut his bread into neat little square, completely absorb in his task. He must have fancy I have tell him where the girl be stay. We have coffee outside face the sea. Poirot smoke one of his tiny cigarette, and then draw his watch from his pocket. \"The train to Paris leave at 2:25,\" he observe. \"I should be start.\" \"Paris?\" I cry. \"That be what I say, _mon ami___.\" \"You be go to Paris? But why?\" He reply very seriously. \"To look for the murderer of M. Renauld.\" \"You think he be in Paris?\" \"I be quite certain that he be not. Nevertheless"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "Mr. Barrymore be of interest to me. She be a heavy, solid person, very limit, intensely respectable, and incline to be puritanical. You could hardly conceive a le emotional subject. Yet I have tell you how, on the first night here, I hear her sob bitterly, and since then I have more than once observe trace of tear upon her face. Some deep sorrow gnaw ever at her heart. Sometimes I wonder if she have a guilty memory which haunt her, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of be a domestic tyrant. I have always felt that there be something singular and questionable in this man's character, but the adventure of last night bring all my suspicion to a head. And yet it may seem a small matter in itself. You be aware that I be not a very sound sleeper, and since I have be on guard in this house my slumber have be lighter than ever. Last night, about two in the morning, I be arouse by a stealthy step pas my room. I rise, open my door, and peep out. A long black shadow be trail down the corridor. It be throw by a man who walk softly down the passage with a candle hold in his hand. He be in shirt and trouser, with no cover to his foot. I could merely see the outline, but his height tell me that it be Barrymore. He walk very slowly and circumspectly, and there be something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance. I have tell you that the corridor be break by the balcony which run round the hall, but that it be resume upon the farther side. I wait until he have pas out of sight and then I follow him. When I come round the balcony he have reach the end of the farther corridor, and I could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he have enter one of the room. Now, all these room be unfurnished and unoccupied so that his expedition become more mysterious than ever. The light shine steadily a if he be stand motionless. I creep down the passage a noiselessly a I could and peep round the corner of the door. Barrymore be crouch at the window with the candle hold against the glass. His profile be half turn towards me, and his face seem to be rigid with expectation a he star out into the blackness of the moor. For some minute he stand watch intently. Then he give a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light. Instantly I make my way back to my room, and very shortly come the stealthy step pas once more upon their return journey. Long afterwards when I have fall into a light sleep I hear a key turn somewhere in a lock, but I could not tell whence the sound come. What it all mean I cannot guess, but there be some secret business go on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of. I do not trouble you with my theory, for you ask me to furnish you only with fact. I have have a long talk with Sir Henry this morning, and we have make a plan of campaign found upon my observation of last night. I will not speak about it just now, but it should make my next report interest read. Baskerville Hall, Oct. 15th. MY DEAR HOLMES: If I be compel to leave you without much news during the early day of my mission you must acknowledge that I be make up for lose time, and that event be now crowd thick and fast upon u. In my last report I end upon my top note with Barrymore at the window, and now I have quite a budget already which will, unless I be much mistake, considerably surprise you. Thing have take a turn which I could not have anticipate. In some way they have within the last forty-eight hour become much clearer and in some way they have become more complicate. But I will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself. Before breakfast on the morning follow my adventure I go down the corridor and examine the room in which Barrymore have be on the night before. The western window through which he have star so intently have, I notice, one peculiarity above all other window in the house--it command the nearest outlook on to the moor. There be an open between two tree which enable one from this point of view to look right down upon it, while from all the other window it be only a distant glimpse which can be obtain. It follow, therefore, that Barrymore, since only this window would serve the purpose, must have be look out for something or somebody upon the moor. The night be very dark, so that I can hardly imagine how he could have hop to see anyone. It have strike me that it be possible that some love intrigue be on foot. That would have account for his stealthy movement and also for the uneasiness of his wife. The man be a strike-look fellow, very well equip to steal the heart of a country girl, so that this theory seem to have something to support it. That open of the door which I have hear after I have return to my room might mean that he have go out to keep some clandestine appointment. So I reason with myself in the morning, and I tell you the direction of my suspicion, however much the result may have show that they be unfounded. But whatever the true explanation of Barrymore's movement might be, I felt that the responsibility of keep them to myself until I could explain them be more than I could bear. I have an interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast, and I tell him all that I have see. He be le surprise than I have expect. \"I know that Barrymore walk about night, and I have a mind to speak to him about it,\" say he. \"Two or three time I have hear his step in the passage, come and go, just about the hour you name.\" \"Perhaps then he pay a visit every night to that particular window,\" I suggest. \"Perhaps he do. If so, we should be able to shadow him and see what it be that he be after. I wonder what your friend Holmes would do if he be here.\" \"I believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest,\" say I. \"He would follow Barrymore and see what he do.\" \"Then we shall do it together.\" \"But surely he would hear u.\" \"The man be rather deaf, and in any case we must take our chance of that. We'll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he pas.\" Sir Henry rub his hand with pleasure, and it be evident that he hail the adventure a a relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor. The baronet have be in communication with the architect who prepare the plan for Sir Charles, and with a contractor from London, so that we may expect great change to begin here soon. There have be decorator and furnishers up from Plymouth, and it be evident that our friend have large idea and mean to spare no pain or expense to restore the grandeur of his family. When the house be renovate and refurnish, all that he will need will be a wife to make it complete. Between ourselves there be pretty clear sign that this will not be want if the lady be will, for I have seldom see a man more infatuate with a woman than he be with our beautiful neighbor, Miss Stapleton. And yet the course of true love do not run quite a smoothly a one would under the circumstance expect. Today, for example, it surface be break by a very unexpected ripple, which have cause our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance. After the conversation which I have quote about Barrymore, Sir Henry put on his hat and prepare to go out. A a matter of course I do the same. \"What, be you come, Watson?\" he ask"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "In the meantime the fight go on.\" \"I wish,\" I say, \"that one could be sure that the right people be the one to get kill. I mean the one who want to fight--not just all the poor people who happen to live in the part where the fight be go on.\" He nod. \"I know what you mean, Anne. That's the unfairness of war. But I've other news for you.\" \"Yes?\" \"A confession of incompetency on my part. Pedler have manage to escape.\" \"What?\" \"Yes. No one know how he manage it. He be securely lock up for the night--in an upper-story room of one of the farm roundabout which the Military have take over, but this morning the room be empty and the bird have fly.\" Secretly I be rather please. Never, to this day, have I be able to rid myself of a sneak fondness for Sir Eustace. I dare say it's reprehensible, but there it be. I admire him. He be a thorough-go villain, I dare say--but he be a pleasant one. I've never meet any one half so amuse since. I conceal my feel, of course. Naturally Colonel Race would feel quite differently about it. He want Sir Eustace bring to justice. There be nothing very surprise in his escape when one come to think of it. All round Jo'burg he must have innumerable spy and agent. And, whatever Colonel Race might think, I be exceedingly doubtful that they would ever catch him. He probably have a well-plan line of retreat. Indeed, he have say a much to u. I express myself suitably, though in a rather lukewarm manner, and the conversation languish. Then Colonel Race ask suddenly for Harry. I tell him that he have go off at dawn and that I hadn't see him this morning. \"You understand, don't you, Anne, that apart from formality, he be completely clear? There be technicality, of course, but Sir Eustace's guilt be well assure. There be nothing now to keep you apart.\" He say this without look at me, in a slow, jerky voice. \"I understand,\" I say gratefully. \"And there be no reason why he should not at once resume his real name.\" \"No, of course not.\" \"You know his real name?\" The question surprise me. \"Of course I do. Harry Lucas.\" He do not answer, and something in the quality of his silence strike me a peculiar. \"Anne, do you remember that, a we drive home from the Matoppos that day, I tell you that I know what I have to do?\" \"Of course I remember.\" \"I think that I may fairly say I have do it. The man you love be clear of suspicion.\" \"Be that what you mean?\" \"Of course.\" I hang my head, ashamed of the baseless suspicion I have entertain. He speak again in a thoughtful voice: \"When I be a mere youngster, I be in love with a girl who jilt me. After that I think only of my work. My career mean everything to me. Then I meet you, Anne--and all that seem worth nothing. But youth's call to youth. . . . I've still get my work.\" I be silent. I suppose one can't really love two men at once--but you can feel like it. The magnetism of this man be very great. I look up at him suddenly. \"I think that you'll go very far,\" I say dreamily. \"I think that you've get a great career ahead of you. You'll be one of the world's big men.\" I felt a though I be utter a prophecy. \"I shall be alone, though.\" \"All the people who do really big thing be.\" \"You think so?\" \"I'm sure of it.\" He take my hand and say in a low voice: \"I'd rather have have--the other.\" Then Harry come stride round the corner of the house. Colonel Race rise. \"Good morning--Lucas,\" he say. For some reason Harry flush up to the root of his hair. \"Yes,\" I say gaily, \"you must be know by your real name now.\" But Harry be still star at Colonel Race. \"So you know, sir,\" he say at last. \"I never forget a face. I saw you once a a boy.\" \"What's all this about?\" I ask, puzzle, look from one to the other. It seem a conflict of will between them. Race win. Harry turn slightly away. \"I suppose you're right, sir. Tell her my real name.\" \"Anne, this isn't Harry Lucas. Harry Lucas be kill in the War. This be John Harold Eardsley.\" With his last word Colonel Race have swing away and leave u. I stand star after him. Harry's voice recall me to myself. \"Anne, forgive me, say you forgive me.\" He take my hand in his and almost mechanically I draw it away. \"Why do you deceive me?\" \"I don't know that I can make you understand. I be afraid of all that sort of thing--the power and fascination of wealth. I want you to care for me just for myself--for the man I be--without ornament and trapping.\" \"You mean you didn't trust me?\" \"You can put it that way if you like, but it isn't quite true. I'd become embitter, suspicious--always prone to look for ulterior motif--and it be so wonderful to be care for in the way you care for me.\" \"I see,\" I say slowly. I be go over in my own mind the story he have tell me. For the first time I note discrepancy in it which I have disregard--an assurance of money, the power to buy back the diamond of Nadina, the way in which he have prefer to speak of both men from the point of view of an outsider. And when he have say \"my friend\" he have mean, not Eardsley, but Lucas. It be Lucas, the quiet fellow, who have love Nadina so deeply. \"How do it come about?\" I ask. \"We be both reckless--anxious to get kill. One night we exchange identification disk--for luck! Lucas be kill the next day--blow to piece.\" I shudder. \"But why didn't you tell me now? This morning? You couldn't have doubt my care for you by this time?\" \"Anne, I didn't want to spoil it all. I want to take you back to the island. What's the good of money? It can't buy happiness. We'd have be happy on the island. I tell you I'm afraid of that other life--it nearly rot me through once.\" \"Do Sir Eustace know who you really be?\" \"Oh, yes.\" \"And Carton?\" \"No. He saw u both with Nadina at Kimberley one night, but he didn't know which be which. He accept my statement that I be Lucas, and Nadina be deceive by his cable. She be never afraid of Lucas. He be a quiet chap--very deep. But I always have the devil's own temper. She'd have be scar out of her life if she'd know that I'd come to life again.\" \"Harry, if Colonel Race hadn't tell me, what do you mean to do?\" \"Say nothing. Go on a Lucas.\" \"And your father's million?\" \"Race be welcome to them. Anyway, he would make a better use of them than I ever shall. Anne, what be you think about? You're frown so.\" \"I'm think,\" I say slowly, \"that I almost wish Colonel Race hadn't make you tell me.\" \"No. He be right. I owe you the truth.\" He pause, then say suddenly: \"You know, Anne, I'm jealous of Race. He love you too--and he's a bigger man than I be or ever shall be.\" I turn to him, laugh. \"Harry, you idiot. It's you I want--and that's all that matter.\" A soon a possible we start for Cape Town. There Suzanne be wait to greet me, and we disembowel the big giraffe together. When the Revolution be finally quell, Colonel Race come down to Cape Town and at his suggestion the big villa at Muizenberg that have belong to Sir Lawrence Eardsley be reopen and we all take up our abide in it. There we make our plan. I be to return to England with Suzanne and to be marry from her house in London. And the trousseau be to be buy in Paris! Suzanne enjoy plan all these"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "That depend on whether you be go on the moor,\" say I. \"Yes, I be.\" \"Well, you know what my instruction be. I be sorry to intrude, but you hear how earnestly Holmes insist that I should not leave you, and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor.\" Sir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile. \"My dear fellow,\" say he, \"Holmes, with all his wisdom, do not foresee some thing which have happen since I have be on the moor. You understand me? I be sure that you be the last man in the world who would wish to be a spoil-sport. I must go out alone.\" It put me in a most awkward position. I be at a loss what to say or what to do, and before I have make up my mind he pick up his cane and be go. But when I come to think the matter over my conscience reproach me bitterly for have on any pretext allow him to go out of my sight. I imagine what my feel would be if I have to return to you and to confess that some misfortune have occur through my disregard for your instruction. I assure you my cheek flush at the very think. It might not even now be too late to overtake him, so I set off at once in the direction of Merripit House. I hurry along the road at the top of my speed without see anything of Sir Henry, until I come to the point where the moor path branch off. There, fear that perhaps I have come in the wrong direction after all, I mount a hill from which I could command a view--the same hill which be cut into the dark quarry. Thence I saw him at once. He be on the moor path about a quarter of a mile off, and a lady be by his side who could only be Miss Stapleton. It be clear that there be already an understand between them and that they have meet by appointment. They be walk slowly along in deep conversation, and I saw her make quick little movement of her hand a if she be very earnest in what she be say, while he listen intently, and once or twice shake his head in strong dissent. I stand among the rock watch them, very much puzzle a to what I should do next. To follow them and break into their intimate conversation seem to be an outrage, and yet my clear duty be never for an instant to let him out of my sight. To act the spy upon a friend be a hateful task. Still, I could see no better course than to observe him from the hill, and to clear my conscience by confess to him afterwards what I have do. It be true that if any sudden danger have threaten him I be too far away to be of use, and yet I be sure that you will agree with me that the position be very difficult, and that there be nothing more which I could do. Our friend, Sir Henry, and the lady have halt on the path and be stand deeply absorb in their conversation, when I be suddenly aware that I be not the only witness of their interview. A wisp of green float in the air catch my eye, and another glance show me that it be carry on a stick by a man who be move among the break grind. It be Stapleton with his butterfly-net. He be very much closer to the pair than I be, and he appear to be move in their direction. At this instant Sir Henry suddenly draw Miss Stapleton to his side. His arm be round her, but it seem to me that she be strain away from him with her face avert. He stoop his head to hers, and she raise one hand a if in protest. Next moment I saw them spring apart and turn hurriedly round. Stapleton be the cause of the interruption. He be run wildly towards them, his absurd net dangle behind him. He gesticulate and almost dance with excitement in front of the lover. What the scene mean I could not imagine, but it seem to me that Stapleton be abuse Sir Henry, who offer explanation, which become more angry a the other refuse to accept them. The lady stand by in haughty silence. Finally Stapleton turn upon his heel and beckon in a peremptory way to his sister, who, after an irresolute glance at Sir Henry, walk off by the side of her brother. The naturalist's angry gesture show that the lady be include in his displeasure. The baronet stand for a minute look after them, and then he walk slowly back the way that he have come, his head hang, the very picture of dejection. What all this mean I could not imagine, but I be deeply ashamed to have witness so intimate a scene without my friend's knowledge. I run down the hill therefore and meet the baronet at the bottom. His face be flush with anger and his brow be wrinkle, like one who be at his wit's end what to do. \"Halloa, Watson! Where have you drop from?\" say he. \"You don't mean to say that you come after me in spite of all?\" I explain everything to him: how I have find it impossible to remain behind, how I have follow him, and how I have witness all that have occur. For an instant his eye blaze at me, but my frankness disarm his anger, and he break at last into a rather rueful laugh. \"You would have think the middle of that prairie a fairly safe place for a man to be private,\" say he, \"but, by thunder, the whole countryside seem to have be out to see me do my woo--and a mighty poor woo at that! Where have you engage a seat?\" \"I be on that hill.\" \"Quite in the back row, eh? But her brother be well up to the front. Do you see him come out on u?\" \"Yes, I do.\" \"Do he ever strike you a be crazy--this brother of hers?\" \"I can't say that he ever do.\" \"I dare say not. I always think him sane enough until today, but you can take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a straitjacket. What's the matter with me, anyhow? You've live near me for some week, Watson. Tell me straight, now! Be there anything that would prevent me from make a good husband to a woman that I love?\" \"I should say not.\" \"He can't object to my worldly position, so it must be myself that he have this down on. What have he against me? I never hurt man or woman in my life that I know of. And yet he would not so much a let me touch the tip of her finger.\" \"Do he say so?\" \"That, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I've only know her these few week, but from the first I just felt that she be make for me, and she, too--she be happy when she be with me, and that I'll swear. There's a light in a woman's eye that speak louder than word. But he have never let u get together and it be only today for the first time that I saw a chance of have a few word with her alone. She be glad to meet me, but when she do it be not love that she would talk about, and she wouldn't have let me talk about it either if she could have stop it. She keep come back to it that this be a place of danger, and that she would never be happy until I have leave it. I tell her that since I have see her I be in no hurry to leave it, and that if she really want me to go, the only way to work it be for her to arrange to go with me. With that I offer in a many word to marry her, but before she could answer, down come this brother of hers, run"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "Gertrude, I don't think Halsey know the--the murder man, do he?\"  But Mr. Jamieson be sure of his grind.  \"The quarrel, I believe,\" he persist, \"be about Mr. Armstrong's conduct to you, Miss Gertrude.  He have be pay you unwelcome attention.\"  And I have never see the man!  When she nod a \"yes\" I saw the tremendous possibility involve. If this detective could prove that Gertrude fear and dislike the murder man, and that Mr. Armstrong have be annoy and possibly pursue her with hateful attention, all that, add to Gertrude's confession of her presence in the billiard-room at the time of the crime, look strange, to say the least.  The prominence of the family assure a strenuous effort to find the murderer, and if we have nothing worse to look forward to, we be sure of a distasteful publicity.  Mr. Jamieson shut his note-book with a snap, and thank u.  \"I have an idea,\" he say, apropos of nothing at all, \"that at any rate the ghost be lay here.  Whatever the rappings have be--and the colour man say they begin when the family go west three month ago--they be likely to stop now.\"  Which show how much he know about it.  The ghost be not lay: with the murder of Arnold Armstrong he, or it, only seem to take on fresh vigour.  Mr. Jamieson leave then, and when Gertrude have go up-stair, a she do at once, I sit and think over what I have just hear. Her engagement, once so engross a matter, pal now beside the significance of her storey.  If Halsey and Jack Bailey have leave before the crime, how come Halsey's revolver in the tulip bed? What be the mysterious cause of their sudden flight?  What have Gertrude leave in the billiard-room?  What be the significance of the cuff-link, and where be it?     When the detective leave he enjoin absolute secrecy on everybody in the household.  The Greenwood Club promise the same thing, and a there be no Sunday afternoon paper, the murder be not publicly know until Monday.  The coroner himself notify the Armstrong family lawyer, and early in the afternoon he come out. I have not see Mr. Jamieson since morning, but I know he have be interrogate the servant.  Gertrude be lock in her room with a headache, and I have luncheon alone.  Mr. Harton, the lawyer, be a little, thin man, and he look a if he do not relish his business that day.  \"This be very unfortunate, Miss Innes,\" he say, after we have shake hand.  \"Most unfortunate--and mysterious.  With the father and mother in the west, I find everything devolve on me; and, a you can understand, it be an unpleasant duty.\"  \"No doubt,\" I say absently.  \"Mr. Harton, I be go to ask you some question, and I hope you will answer them.  I feel that I be entitle to some knowledge, because I and my family be just now in a most ambiguous position.\"  I don't know whether he understand me or not: he take of his glass and wipe them.  \"I shall be very happy,\" he say with old-fashion courtesy.  \"Thank you.  Mr. Harton, do Mr. Arnold Armstrong know that Sunnyside have be rent?\"  \"I think--yes, he do.  In fact, I myself tell him about it.\"  \"And he know who the tenant be?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"He have not be live with the family for some year, I believe?\"  \"No.  Unfortunately, there have be trouble between Arnold and his father.  For two year he have live in town.\"  \"Then it would be unlikely that he come here last night to get possession of anything belong to him?\" He suggest that we have prayer over the body when we place them in the boat, and I agree to read the burial service from the Episcopal Prayer Book.  The voice from Turner's cabin come steadily, Miss Lee's low tone, Turner's heavy bass only now and then.  Once I hear her give a startle exclamation, and both Jones and I leap to the door.  But the next moment she be talk again quietly.  Ten minute--fifteen--pas.  I grow restless and take to wander about the cabin.  Mr. John come to the door opposite, and ask to have tea send down to the stewardess.  I call the request up the companionway, unwilling to leave the cabin for a moment.  When I come back, Jones be stand at the door of Vail's cabin, look in.  His face be pale.  \"Look there!\" he say hoarsely.  \"Look at the bell.  He must have try to push the button!\"  I star in.  Williams have put the cabin to right, a nearly a he could.  The soak mattress be go, and a clean linen sheet be spread over the bunk.  Poor Vail's clothe, a he have take it off the night before, hang on a mahogany stand beside the bed, and above, almost conceal by his coat, be the bell.  Jones's eye be fix on the darkish smear, over and around the bell, on the white paint.  I measure the height of the bell from the bed.  It be well above, and to one side--a smear rather than a print, too indeterminate to be of any value, sinister, cruel.  \"He didn't do that, Charlie,\" I say.  \"He couldn't have get up to it after--That be the murderer's mark.  He lean there, one hand against the wall, to look down at his work. And, without know it, he press the button that rouse the two woman.\"  He have not hear the storey of Henrietta Sloane, and, a we wait, I tell him.  Some of the tension be relax.  He try, in his argumentative German way, to drag me into a discussion a to the foreordination of a death that result from an accidental ring of a bell.  But my ear be alert for the voice near by, and soon Miss Lee open the door.  Turner be sit on his bunk.  He have make an attempt to shave, and have cut his chin severely.  He be in a dress-gown, and be hold a handkerchief to his face; he peer at me over it with red-rim eye.  \"This--this be horrible, Leslie,\" he say.  \"I can hardly believe it.\"  \"It be true, Mr. Turner.\"  He take the handkerchief away and look to see if the bleed have stop.  I believe he intend to impress u both with his coolness, but it be an unfortunate attempt.  His lip, relieve of the pressure, be twitch; his nerveless finger could hardly refold the handkerchief.  \"Wh-why be I not--call at once?\" he demand.  \"I notify you.  You be--you must have go to sleep again.\"  \"I don't believe you call me.  You're--lie, aren't you?\"  He get up, steady himself by the wall, and sway dizzily to the motion of the ship.  \"You shut me off down here, and then run thing your own damn way.\"  He turn on Miss Lee.  \"Where's Helen?\"  \"In her room, Marsh.  She have one of her headache.  Please don't disturb her.\"  \"Where's Williams?\" He turn to me.  \"I can get him for you.\"  \"Tell him to bring me a highball.  My mouth's sticky.\"  He run his tongue over his dry lip.  \"And--take a message from me to Richardson--\"  He stop, startle.  Indeed, Miss Lee and I have both start.  \"To who's run the boat, anyhow?  Singleton?\"  \"Mr. Singleton be a prisoner in the forward house,\" I say gravely.  The effect of this be astonish.  He star at u both, and, find corroboration in Miss Lee's face, his own take on an instant expression of relief.  He drop to the side of the bed, and his colour come slowly back.  He even smile--a crafty grin that be inexpressibly horrible.  \"Singleton!\" he say.  \"Why do they--how do they know it be he?\"  \"He have quarrel with the captain last night, and he be on duty at the time of the when the thing happen.  The man at the wheel claim to have see him in the chartroom just before, and there be other evidence, I believe.  The lookout saw him forward, with something--possibly the axe.  Not decisive, of course, but enough to justify put him in iron.  Somebody do it, and the murderer be on board, Mr"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "You must stop work now, and when you go downstairs just say that I wish to see Brunton.\" \"'\"The butler be go,\" say she. \"'\"Go! Go where?\" \"'\"He be go. No one have see him. He be not in his room. Oh, yes, he be go, he be go!\" She fell back against the wall with shriek after shriek of laughter, while I, horrify at this sudden hysterical attack, rush to the bell to summon help. The girl be take to her room, still scream and sob, while I make inquiry about Brunton. There be no doubt about it that he have disappear. His bed have not be sleep in, he have be see by no one since he have retire to his room the night before, and yet it be difficult to see how he could have leave the house, a both window and door be find to be fasten in the morning. His clothe, his watch, and even his money be in his room, but the black suit which he usually wear be miss. His slipper, too, be go, but his boot be leave behind. Where then could butler Brunton have go in the night, and what could have become of him now? \"'Of course we search the house from cellar to garret, but there be no trace of him. It be, a I have say, a labyrinth of an old house, especially the original wing, which be now practically uninhabited; but we ransack every room and cellar without discover the least sign of the miss man. It be incredible to me that he could have go away leave all his property behind him, and yet where could he be? I call in the local police, but without success. Rain have fall on the night before and we examine the lawn and the path all round the house, but in vain. Matter be in this state, when a new development quite draw our attention away from the original mystery. \"'For two day Rachel Howells have be so ill, sometimes delirious, sometimes hysterical, that a nurse have be employ to sit up with her at night. On the third night after Brunton's disappearance, the nurse, find her patient sleep nicely, have drop into a nap in the armchair, when she wake in the early morning to find the bed empty, the window open, and no sign of the invalid. I be instantly arouse, and, with the two footman, start off at once in search of the miss girl. It be not difficult to tell the direction which she have take, for, start from under her window, we could follow her footmark easily across the lawn to the edge of the mere, where they vanish close to the gravel path which lead out of the ground. The lake there be eight foot deep, and you can imagine our feel when we saw that the trail of the poor demented girl come to an end at the edge of it. \"'Of course, we have the drag at once, and set to work to recover the remain, but no trace of the body could we find. On the other hand, we bring to the surface an object of a most unexpected kind. It be a linen bag which contain within it a mass of old rust and discolor metal and several dull-color piece of pebble or glass. This strange find be all that we could get from the mere, and, although we make every possible search and inquiry yesterday, we know nothing of the fate either of Rachel Howells or of Richard Brunton. The county police be at their wits' end, and I have come up to you a a last resource.' \"You can imagine, Watson, with what eagerness I listen to this extraordinary sequence of event, and endeavor to piece them together, and to devise some common thread upon which they might all hang. The butler be go. The maid be go. The maid have love the butler, but have afterwards have cause to hate him. She be of Welsh blood, fiery and passionate. She have be terribly excite immediately after his disappearance. She have fling into the lake a bag contain some curious content. These be all factor which have to be take into consideration, and yet none of them get quite to the heart of the matter. What be the start-point of this chain of event? There lay the end of this tangle line. \"'I must see that paper, Musgrave,' say I, 'which this butler of yours think it worth his while to consult, even at the risk of the loss of his place.' \"'It be rather an absurd business, this ritual of ours,' he answer. 'But it have at least the save grace of antiquity to excuse it. I have a copy of the question and answer here if you care to run your eye over them.' \"He hand me the very paper which I have here, Watson, and this be the strange catechism to which each Musgrave have to submit when he come to man's estate. I will read you the question and answer a they stand. \"'Whose be it?' \"'His who be go.' \"'Who shall have it?' \"'He who will come.' \"'Where be the sun?' \"'Over the oak.' \"'Where be the shadow?' \"'Under the elm.' \"How be it step?' \"'North by ten and by ten, east by five and by five, south by two and by two, west by one and by one, and so under.' \"'What shall we give for it?' \"'All that be ours.' \"'Why should we give it?' \"'For the sake of the trust.' \"'the original have no date, but be in the spell of the middle of the seventeenth century,' remark Musgrave. 'I be afraid, however, that it can be of little help to you in solve this mystery.' \"'At least,' say I, 'it give u another mystery, and one which be even more interest than the first. It may be that the solution of the one may prove to be the solution of the other. You will excuse me, Musgrave, if I say that your butler appear to me to have be a very clever man, and to have have a clearer insight than ten generation of his master.' \"'I hardly follow you,' say Musgrave. 'the paper seem to me to be of no practical importance.' \"'But to me it seem immensely practical, and I fancy that Brunton take the same view. He have probably see it before that night on which you catch him.' \"'It be very possible. We take no pain to hide it.' \"'He simply wish, I should imagine, to refresh his memory upon that last occasion. He have, a I understand, some sort of map or chart which he be compare with the manuscript, and which he thrust into his pocket when you appear.' \"'that be true. But what could he have to do with this old family custom of ours, and what do this rigmarole mean?' \"'I don't think that we should have much difficulty in determine that,' say I; 'with your permission we will take the first train down to Sussex, and go a little more deeply into the matter upon the spot.' \"The same afternoon saw u both at Hurlstone. Possibly you have see picture and read description of the famous old build, so I will confine my account of it to say that it be build in the shape of an L, the long arm be the more modern portion, and the shorter the ancient nucleus, from which the other have develop. Over the low, heavily-lintelled door, in the center of this old part, be chisel the date, 1607, but expert be agree that the beam and stonework be really much older than this. The enormously thick wall and tiny window of this part have in the last century drive the family into build the new wing, and the old one be use now a a storehouse and a cellar, when it be use at all. A splendid park with fine old timber surround the house, and the lake, to which my client have refer, lay close to the avenue, about two hundred yard from the build. \"I be already firmly convince, Watson, that there be not three separate mystery here, but one only, and that if I could read the"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "Turner.\"  His grin have fade, but the crafty look in his pale-blue eye remain.  \"The chart-room be dark.  How could the steersman--\"  He check himself abruptly, and look at u both quickly.  \"Where be--they?\" he ask in a different tone.  \"On deck.\"  \"We can't keep them in this weather.\"  \"We must,\" I say.  \"We will have to get to the nearest port a quickly a we can, and surrender ourselves and the body.  This thing will have to be sift to the bottom, Mr. Turner.  The innocent must not suffer for the guilty, and every one on the ship be under suspicion.\"  He fell into a passion at that, insist that the body be bury at once, assert his ownership of the vessel a his authority, demand to know what I, a forecastle hand, have to say about it, fling up and down the small room, shower me with invective and threat, and shove Miss Lee aside when she lay a calm hand on his arm.  The cut on his chin be bleed again, add to his wild and sinister expression.  He end by demand Williams.  I open the door and call to Charlie Jones to send the butler, and stand by, wait for the fresh explosion that be come. Williams shakily confess that there be no whiskey on board.  \"Where be it?\" Turner thunder.  Williams look at me.  He be in a state of inarticulate fright.  \"I order it overboard,\" I say.  Turner whirl on me, incredulity and rage in his face.  \"You!\"  I put the best face I could on the matter, and eye him steadily. \"There have be too much drink on this ship,\" I say.  \"If you doubt it, go up and look at the three body on the deck.\"  \"What have you to do about it?\"  His eye be narrow; there be menace in every line of his face.  \"With Schwartz go, Captain Richardson dead, and Singleton in iron, the crew have no officer.  They ask me to take charge.\"  \"So!  And you use your authority to meddle with what do not concern you  The ship have an officer while I be on it.  And there will be no mutiny.\"  He fling into the main cabin, and make for the forward companionway. I step back to allow Miss Lee to precede me.  She be stand, her back to the dress-stand, face the door.  She look at me and make a helpless gesture with her hand, a if the situation be beyond her. Then I saw her look down.  She take a quick step or two toward the door, and, stoop pick up some small object from almost under my foot.  The incident would have pas without notice, have she not, in attempt to wrap it in her handkerchief, drop it.  I saw then that it be a key.  \"Let me get it for you,\" I say.  To my amazement, she put her foot over it.  \"Please see what Mr. Turner be do,\" she say.  \"It be the key to my jewel-case.\"  \"Will you let me see it?\"  \"No.\"  \"It be not the key to a jewel-case.\"  \"It do not concern you what it be.\"  \"It be the key to the storeroom door.\"  \"You be stronger than I be.  You look the brute.  You can knock me away and get it.\"  I know then, of course, that it be the storeroom key.  But I could not take it by force.  And so defiantly she face me, so valiant be every line of her slight figure, that I be ashamed of my impulse to push her aside and take it.  I love her with every inch of my overgrow body, and I do the thing she know I would do.  I bow and leave the cabin. But I have no intention of lose the key.  I could not take it by force, but she know a well a I do what find it there in Turner's room mean.  Turner have lock me in. But I must be able to prove it--my wit against hers, and the advantage mine.  I have the woman under guard.  I go up on deck.  A curious spectacle reveal itself.  Turner, purple with anger, be harangue the men, who stand amidships, huddle together, but grim and determine withal.  Burn, a little apart from the rest, be stand, sullen, his arm fold.  A Turner cease, he take a step forward.  \"You be right, Mr. Turner,\" he say.  \"It's your ship, and it's up to you to say where she go and how she go, sir.  But some one will hang for this, Mr. Turner,--some one that's on this deck now; and the body be go back with u--likewise the axe.  There ain't go to be a mistake--the right man be go to swing.\"  \"That's mutiny!\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Burn acknowledge, his face pal a little.  \"I guess you could call it that.\"  Turner swing on his heel and go below, where Jones, relieve of guard duty by Burn, report him lock in his room, refuse admission to his wife and Miss Lee, both of whom have knock on the door.  The trouble with Turner add to the general misery of the situation. Burn get our position at noon with more or le exactness, and the general work of the Ella go on well enough.  But the situation be indescribable.  Men start if a penknife drop, and swear if a sail flap.  The call of the boatswain's pipe rasp their ear, and the preparation for stow the body in the jolly-boat leave them unnerve and sick.  Some sort of a meal be cook, but no one could eat; Williams bring up, untasted, the luncheon he have carry down to the after house.  At two o'clock all hand gather amidships, and the body be carry forward to where the boat, lower in it davit and brace, lay on the deck.  It have be line with canvas and tarpaulin, and a cover of similar material lay ready to be nail in place.  All the men be bareheaded.  Many be in tear.  Miss Lee come forward with u, and it be from her prayer-book that I, too move for self-consciousness, read the burial-service.  \"I be the resurrection and the life,\" I read huskily.  The figure at my foot, in their canvas shroud, roll gently with the rock of the ship; the sun beat down on the deck, on the bare head of the men, on the gild edge of the prayer-book, gleam in the light, on the last of the land-bird, droop in the heat on the main cross-tree.  \"... For man walketh in a vain shadow,\" I read, \"and disquieteth himself in vain....  \"O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength: before I go hence, and be no more see.\"      Mr. John and the stewardess come up late in the afternoon.  We have rail off a part of the deck around the forward companionway for them, and none of the crew except the man on guard be allow inside the rope.  After a consultation, find the ship very short-hand, and unwilling with the night come on to trust any of the men, Burn and I decide to take over this duty ourselves, and, by station ourselves at the top of the companionway, to combine the duty of officer on watch and guard of the after house.  To make the woman doubly secure, we have Oleson nail all the window close, although they be merely porthole.  Jones be no longer on guard below, and I have exchange Singleton's worthless revolver for my own serviceable one.  Mr. John, carefully dress, survey the rail-off deck with raise eyebrow.  \"For--u?\" she ask, look at me.  The men be gather about the wheel aft, and be out of ear-shoot.  Mr. Sloane have drop into a steamer-chair, and be lie back with close eye.  \"Yes, Mr. John.\"  \"Where have you put them?\"  I point to where the jolly-boat, on the port side of the ship, swing on it davit.  \"And the mate, Mr. Singleton?\"  \"He be in the forward house.\"  \"What do you do with the--the weapon?\"  \"Why do you ask that?\"  \"Morbid curiosity,\" she say, with a lightness of tone that ring false to my ear.  \"And"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "If the quarrel recommence during the night, the other boarder, name Reynolds, in the next room, hear nothing. Mr. Pitman be up and down until one o'clock, when she doze off.

He and Mr. Pitman investigate. The boat which Mr. Pitman use during a flood, and which she have tie to the stair-rail, be go, have be cut loose, not untie. Everything else be quiet, except that Mr. Ladley's dog have be shut in a third-storey room.  \"'At a quarter after four that morning Mr. Pitman, thoroughly awake, hear the boat return, and go to the stair, meet Ladley come in. He mutter something about have go for medicine for his wife and go to his room, shut the dog out.

At a quarter after seven, Ladley ask for coffee and toast for one, and on Mr. Pitman remark this, say that his wife be not play this week, and have go for a few days' vacation, have leave early in the morning.' Remember, during the night he have be out for medicine for her. Now she be able to travel, and, in fact, have start.\"  Mr. Howell be frown at the floor. \"If he be do anything wrong, he be do it very badly,\" he say.  \"This be where I enter the case,\" say Mr. Holcombe, \"I row into the lower hall this morning, to fee the dog, Peter, who be whine on the staircase. Mr. Pitman be come down, pale and agitate over the fact that the dog, shortly before, have find float in the parlour down-stair a slipper belong to Mr. Ladley, and, later, a knife with a break blade. She maintain that she have the knife last night up-stair, that it be not break, and that it be take from a shelf in her room while she doze. The question be, then: Why be the knife take? Who take it? And why? Have this man make away with his wife, or have he not?\"  Mr. Howell look at me and smile. \"Mr. Holcombe and I be old enemy,\" he say. \"Mr. Holcombe believe that circumstantial evidence may probably hang a man; I do not.\" And to Mr. Holcombe: \"So, have find a wet slipper and a break knife, you be prepare for murder and sudden death!\"  \"I have more evidence,\" Mr. Holcombe say eagerly, and proceed to tell what we have find in the room. Mr. Howell listen, smile to himself, but at the mention of the onyx clock he get up and go to the mantel.  \"By Jove!\" he say, and stand look at the mark in the dust. \"Be you sure the clock be here yesterday?\"  \"I wind it night before last, and put the key underneath. Yesterday, before they move up, I wind it again.\"  \"The key be go also. Well, what of it, Holcombe? Do he brain her with the clock? Or choke her with the key?\"  Mr. Holcombe be look at his note-book. \"To summarise,\" he say, \"we have here a clue indicate a crime, the rope, the break knife, the slipper, the towel, and the clock. Besides, this scrap of paper may contain some information.\" He open it and sit gaze at it in his palm. Then, \"Be this Ladley's write?\" he ask me in a curious voice.  \"Yes.\"  I glance at the slip. Mr. Holcombe have just read from his note-book: \"Rope, knife, slipper, towel, clock.\"  The slip I have find behind the wash-stand say \"Rope, knife, shoe, towel. Horn--\" The rest of the last word be tear off.  Mr. Howell be star at the mantel. \"Clock!\" he repeat.      It be after four when Mr. Holcombe have finish go over the room. I offer to make both the gentleman some tea, for Mr. Pitman have be an Englishman, and I have get into the habit of have a cup in the afternoon, with a cracker or a bite of bread. But they refuse. Mr. Howell say he have promise to meet a lady, and to bring her through the flood district in a boat. He shake hand with me, and smile at Mr. Holcombe.  \"You will have to restrain his enthusiasm, Mr. Pitman,\" he say. \"He be a bloodhound on the scent. If his bay get on your nerve, just send for me.\" He go down the stair and step into the boat. \"Remember, Holcombe,\" he call, \"every well-constitute murder have two thing: a motive and a corpse. You haven't either, only a mass of piffle detail--\"  \"If everybody wait until he saw flame, instead of rely on the testimony of the smoke,\" Mr. Holcombe snap, \"what would the fire loss be?\"  Mr. Howell pole his boat to the front door, and sit down, prepare to row out.  \"You be warn, Mr. Pitman,\" he call to me. \"If he doesn't find a body to fit the clue, he's quite capable of make one to fill the demand.\"  \"Horn--\" say Mr. Holcombe, look at the slip again. \"The tail of the 'n' be tear off--evidently only part of a word. Hornet, Horn, Horner--Mr. Pitman, will you go with me to the police station?\"  I be more than anxious to go. In fact, I could not bear the idea of stay alone in the house, with heaven only know what conceal in the depth of that muddy flood. I get on my wrap again, and Mr. Holcombe row me out. Peter plunge into the water to follow, and have to be send back. He sit on the lower step and whine. Mr. Holcombe throw him another piece of liver, but he do not touch it.  We row to the corner of Robinson Street and Federal--it be before Federal Street be raise above the flood level--and leave the boat in charge of a boy there. And we walk to the police station. On the way Mr. Holcombe question me closely about the event of the morning, and I recall the incident of the burn pillow-slip. He make a note of it at once, and grow very thoughtful.  He leave me, however, at the police station. \"I'd rather not appear in this, Mr. Pitman,\" he say apologetically, \"and I think better along my own line. Not that I have anything against the police; they've do some splendid work. But this case take imagination, and the police department deal with fact. We have no fact yet. What we need, of course, be to have the man detain until we be sure of our case.\"  He lift his hat and turn away, and I go slowly up the step to the police station. Live, a I have, in a neighbourhood where the police, like the poor, be always with u, and where the visit of the patrol waggon be one of those familiar sight that no amount of repetition enable any of u to treat with contempt, I be uncomfortable until I remember that my grandfather have be one of the first mayor of the city, and that, if the patrol have be at my house more than once, the entire neighbourhood would testify that my boarder be usually orderly.  At the door some one touch me on the arm. It be Mr. Holcombe again.  \"I have be think it over,\" he say, \"and I believe you'd better not mention the piece of paper that you find behind the wash-stand. They might say the whole thing be a hoax.\"  \"Very well,\" I agree, and go in.  The police sergeant in charge know me at once, have stop at my house more than once in flood-time for a cup of hot coffee.  \"Sit down, Mr. Pitman,\" he say. \"I suppose you be still make the best coffee and doughnut in the city of Allegheny? Well, what's the trouble in your district? Want an injunction against the river for trespass?\"  \"The river have bring me a good bite of trouble,\" I"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "I'll let it drop when I'm through with it,\" I assert, and get out my list of address.  \"You'll let it drop because it's too hot to hold,\" he retort, with the suspicion of a smile. \"If you be determine to know about Carter, I can tell you everything that be necessary.\"  The chauffeur stop his engine with an exasperate jerk and settle down in his seat, every line of his back bristle with irritation.  \"I prefer learn from Carter himself.\"  He lean back in his seat and produce an apple from the pocket of his coat.  \"You'll have to travel some to do it, son,\" he say. \"Carter leave for part unknown last night, take with him enough money to keep him in comfort for some little time.\"  \"Until all this blow over,\" I say bitterly.  \"The trip be for the benefit of his health. He have be suffer--and be still suffer, from a curious lapse of memory.\" Davidson smile at me engagingly. \"He have entirely forget everything that occur from the time he enter Mr. Fleming's employment, until that gentleman leave home. I doubt if he will ever recover.\"  With Carter go, his retreat cover by the police, supply with fund from some problematical source, further search for him be worse than useless. In fact, Davidson strongly intimate that it might be dangerous and would be certainly unpleasant. I yield ungraciously and order the cab to take me home. But on the way I curse my folly for not have follow this obvious clue earlier, and I wonder what this thing could be that Carter know, that be at least surmise by various headquarter men, and yet be so carefully hide from the world at large.  The party newspaper have come out that day with a sign statement from Mr. Fleming's physician in Plattsburg that he have be in ill health and incline to melancholia for some time. The air be thick with rumour of difference with his party: the dust cloud cover everything; pretty soon it would settle and hide the track of those who have hurry to cover under it protection.  Davidson leave me at a corner down-town. He turn to give me a part admonition.  \"There's an old axiom in the mill around here, 'never sit down on a piece of metal until you spit on it.' If it sizzle, don't sit.\" He grin. \"Your best position just now, young man, be stand, with your hand over your head. Confidentially, there ain't anything within expectorate distance just now that ain't pretty well het up.\"  He leave me with that, and I do not see him again until the night at the White Cat, when he help put me through the transom. Recently, however, I have meet him several time. He invariably mention the eight dollar and his intention of repay it. Unfortunately, the desire and the ability have not yet happen to coincide.  I take the even train to Bellwood, and get there shortly after eight, in the midst of the Sunday even calm, and the calm of a place like Bellwood be the peace of death without the hope of resurrection.  I walk slowly up the main street, which be line with residence; the town relegate it few shop to le desirable neighbourhood. My first intention have be to see the Episcopal minister, but the rectory be dark, and a burst of organ music from the church near remind me again of the Sunday even service.  Promiscuous inquiry be not advisable. So far, Miss Jane's disappearance be know to very few, and Hunter have advise caution. I wander up the street and turn at random to the right; a few door ahead a newish red brick build proclaim itself the post-office, and give the only sign of life in the neighbourhood. It occur to me that here inside be the one individual who, theoretically at least, in a small place always know the idiosyncrasy of it people.  The door be partly open, for the spring night be sultry. I think I hear something move behind me in the cabin, and wheel sharply, hold my revolver level.  The idea have come to me that the crew have mutiny, and that every one in the after house have be kill.  The idea make me frantic; I think of the woman, of Elsa Lee, and I be ready to kill.  \"Where be the light switch?\" I demand of Singleton, who be still on the companion step, sway.  \"I don't know,\" he say, and collapse, sit huddle just above the captain's body, with his face in his hand.  I saw I need not look to him for help, and I succeed in turn on the light in the swing lamp in the centre of the cabin.  There be no sign of any struggle, and the cabin be empty.  I go back to the captain's body, and throw a rug over it.  Then I reach over and shake Singleton by the arm.  \"Do something!\" I rave.  \"Call the crew.  Get somebody here, you drunken fool!\"  He rise and stagger up the companionway, and I run to Miss Lee's door.  It be close and lock, a be all the others except Vail's and the one I have break open.  I reach Mr. Turner's door last.  It be lock, and I get no response to my knock.  I remember that his room and Vail's connect through a bath, and, still hold my revolver level, I run into Vail's room again, this time turn on the light.  A night light be burn in the bath-room, and the door beyond be unlock.  I fling it open and step in.  Turner be lie on his bed, fully dress, and at first I think he too have be murder. But he be in a drunken stupor.  He sit up, daze, when I shake him by the arm.  \"Mr. Turner!\" I cry.  \"Try to rouse yourself, man!  The captain have be murder, and Mr. Vail!\"  He make an effort to sit up, sway, and fell back again.  His face be swell and purplish, his eye congest.  He make an effort to speak, but fail to be intelligible.  I have no time to waste. Somewhere on the Ella the murderer be loose.  He must be find.  I fling out of Turner's cabin a the crew, gather from the forecastle and from the deck, crowd down the forward companionway. I run my eye over them.  Every man be there, Singleton below by the captain's body, the crew, silent and horror-strike, group on the step: Clarke, Mcnamara, Burn, Oleson, and Adam.  Behind the crew, Charlie Jones have leave the wheel and stand peer down, until sharply order back. Williams, with a bandage on his head, and Tom, the mulatto cook, be in the group.  I stand, revolver in hand, star at the men.  Among them, I felt sure, be the murderer.  But which one?  All be equally pale, equally terrify.  \"Boy,\" I say, \"Mr. Vail and your captain have be murder.  The murderer must be on the ship--one of ourselves.\"  There be a murmur at that.  \"Mr. Singleton, I suggest that these men stay together in a body, and that no one be allow to go below until all have be search and all weapon take from them.\"  Singleton have drop into a chair, and sit with his face bury in his hand, his back to the captain's body.  He look up without move, and his face be grey.  \"All right,\" he say.  \"Do a you like.  I'm sick.\"  He look sick.  Burn, who have take Schwartz's place a second mate, leave the group and come toward me.  \"We'd better waken the woman,\" he say.  \"If you'll tell them, Leslie, I'll take the crew on deck and keep them there.\"  Singleton seem daze, and when Burn speak of take the men on deck, he get up dizzily.  \"I'm go too,\" he mutter.  \"I'll go crazy if I stay down here with that.\"  The rug have be draw back to show the crew what have happen. I draw it reverently over the body again.  After the men have go, I knock at Mr. Turner's door.  It be some time before she rouse; when she answer, her voice be startle.  \"What be it?\"  \"It's Leslie, Mr. Turner.  Will you come to the door?\"  \"In a"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "So she be. Nevertheless, if you want a statement from her concern any event prior to May 7, 1915, she will not be able to give it to you.\" They look at the little man, stupefy. He nod cheerfully. \"It's a pity,\" he say. \"A great pity, especially a I gather, Sir Jam, that the matter be important. But there it be, she can tell you nothing.\" \"But why, man? Darn it all, why?\" The little man shift his benevolent glance to the excite young American. \"Because Janet Vandemeyer be suffer from a complete loss of memory.\" _\"What? \"_ \"Quite so. An interest case, a _very_ interest case. Not so uncommon, really, a you would think. There be several very well know parallel. It's the first case of the kind that I've have under my own personal observation, and I must admit that I've find it of absorb interest.\" There be something rather ghoulish in the little man's satisfaction. \"And she remember nothing,\" say Sir Jam slowly. \"Nothing prior to May 7, 1915. After that date her memory be a good a yours or mine.\" \"Then the first thing she remember?\" \"Be land with the survivor. Everything before that be a blank. She do not know her own name, or where she have come from, or where she be. She couldn't even speak her own tongue.\" \"But surely all this be most unusual?\" put in Julius. \"No, my dear sir. Quite normal under the circumstance. Severe shock to the nervous system. Loss of memory proceed nearly always on the same line. I suggest a specialist, of course. There's a very good man in Paris--make a study of these case--but Mr. Vandemeyer oppose the idea of publicity that might result from such a course.\" \"I can imagine she would,\" say Sir Jam grimly. \"I fell in with her view. There be a certain notoriety give to these case. And the girl be very young--nineteen, I believe. It seem a pity that her infirmity should be talk about--might damage her prospect. Besides, there be no special treatment to pursue in such case. It be really a matter of wait.\" \"Wait?\" \"Yes, sooner or later, the memory will return--a suddenly a it go. But in all probability the girl will have entirely forget the intervene period, and will take up life where she leave off--at the sink of the _Lusitania_.\" \"And when do you expect this to happen?\" The doctor shrug his shoulder. \"Ah, that I cannot say. Sometimes it be a matter of month, sometimes it have be know to be a long a twenty year! Sometimes another shock do the trick. One restore what the other take away.\" \"Another shock, eh?\" say Julius thoughtfully. \"Exactly. There be a case in Colorado----\" The little man's voice trail on, voluble, mildly enthusiastic. Julius do not seem to be listen. He have relapse into his own thought and be frown. Suddenly he come out of his brown study, and hit the table such a resound bang with his fist that every one jump, the doctor most of all. \"I've get it! I guess, doc, I'd like your medical opinion on the plan I'm about to outline. Say Jane be to cross the herring pond again, and the same thing be to happen. The submarine, the sink ship, every one to take to the boat--and so on. Wouldn't that do the trick? Wouldn't it give a mighty big bump to her subconscious self, or whatever the jargon be, and start it function again right away?\" \"A very interest speculation, Mr. Hersheimmer. In my own opinion, it would be successful. It be unfortunate that there be no chance of the condition repeat themselves a you suggest.\" \"Not by nature, perhaps, doc. But I'm talk about art.\" \"Art?\" \"Why, yes. What's the difficulty? Hire a liner----\" \"A liner!\" murmur Dr. Hall faintly. \"Hire some passenger, hire a submarine--that's the only difficulty, I guess. Government be apt to be a bite hide-bind over their engine of war. They won't sell to the first-comer. Still, I guess that can be get over. Ever hear of the word 'graft,' sir? Well, graft get there every time! I reckon that we shan't really need to fire a torpedo. If every one hustle round and scream loud enough that the ship be sink, it ought to be enough for an innocent young girl like Jane. By the time she's get a life-belt on her, and be be hustle into a boat, with a well-drill lot of artiste do the hysterical stunt on deck, why--she ought to be right back where she be in May, 1915. How's that for the bare outline?\" Dr. Hall look at Julius. Everything that he be for the moment incapable of say be eloquent in that look. \"No,\" say Julius, in answer to it, \"I'm not crazy. The thing's perfectly possible. It's do every day in the State for the movie. Haven't you see train in collision on the screen? What's the difference between buy up a train and buy up a liner? Get the property and you can go right ahead!\" Dr. Hall find his voice. \"But the expense, my dear sir.\" His voice rise. \"The expense! It will be _colossal!_\" \"Money doesn't worry me any,\" explain Julius simply. Dr. Hall turn an appeal face to Sir Jam, who smile slightly. \"Mr. Hersheimmer be very well off--very well off indeed.\" The doctor's glance come back to Julius with a new and subtle quality in it. This be no longer an eccentric young fellow with a habit of fall off tree. The doctor's eye hold the deference accord to a really rich man. \"Very remarkable plan. Very remarkable,\" he murmur. \"The movie--of course! Your American word for the kinema. Very interest. I fear we be perhaps a little behind the time over here in our method. And you really mean to carry out this remarkable plan of yours.\" \"You bet your bottom dollar I do.\" The doctor believe him--which be a tribute to his nationality. If an Englishman have suggest such a thing, he would have have grave doubt a to his sanity. \"I cannot guarantee a cure,\" he point out. \"Perhaps I ought to make that quite clear.\" \"Sure, that's all right,\" say Julius. \"You just trot out Jane, and leave the rest to me.\" \"Jane?\" \"Miss Janet Vandemeyer, then. Can we get on the long distance to your place right away, and ask them to send her up; or shall I run down and fetch her in my car?\" The doctor star. \"I beg your pardon, Mr. Hersheimmer. I think you understand.\" \"Understand what?\" \"That Miss Vandemeyer be no longer under my care.\" JULIUS spring up. \"What?\" \"I think you be aware of that.\" \"When do she leave?\" \"Let me see. To-day be Monday, be it not? It must have be last Wednesday--why, surely--yes, it be the same even that you--er--fell out of my tree.\" \"That even? Before, or after?\" \"Let me see--oh yes, afterwards. A very urgent message arrive from Mr. Vandemeyer. The young lady and the nurse who be in charge of her leave by the night train.\" Julius sink back again into his chair. \"Nurse Edith--leave with a patient--I remember,\" he mutter. \"My God, to have be so near!\" Dr. Hall look bewilder. \"I don't understand. Be the young lady not with her aunt, after all?\" Tuppence shake her head. She be about to speak when a warn glance from Sir Jam make her hold her tongue. The lawyer rise. \"I'm much oblige to you, Hall. We're very grateful for all you've tell u. I'm afraid we're now in the position of have to track Miss Vandemeyer anew. What about the nurse who accompany her; I suppose you don't know where she be?\" The doctor shake his head. \"We've not hear from her, a it happen. I understand she be to remain with Miss Vandemeyer for a while. But what can have happen? Surely the girl have not be kidnap.\" \"That remain to be see,\" say Sir Jam gravely. The other hesitate. \"You do not think I ought to go to the police?\" \"No, no. In all probability the young lady be with other relation.\" The doctor be not completely satisfy, but he saw that"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "It be time for u to go.\" \"Can I see her first?\" \"No, she be not conscious. Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I only hope that if ever again I have an important case I shall have the good fortune to have you by my side.\" We stand at the window and watch the cab drive away. A I turn back my eye catch the pellet of paper which the prisoner have toss upon the table. It be the note with which Holmes have decoy him. \"See if you can read it, Watson,\" say he, with a smile. It contain no word, but this little line of dance men:-- GRAPHIC \"If you use the code which I have explain,\" say Holmes, \"you will find that it simply mean 'Come here at once.' I be convince that it be an invitation which he would not refuse, since he could never imagine that it could come from anyone but the lady. And so, my dear Watson, we have end by turn the dance men to good when they have so often be the agent of evil, and I think that I have fulfil my promise of give you something unusual for your note-book. Three-forty be our train, and I fancy we should be back in Baker Street for dinner.\" Only one word of epilog. The American, Abe Slaney, be condemn to death at the winter assize at Norwich; but his penalty be change to penal servitude in consideration of mitigate circumstance, and the certainty that Hilton Cubitt have fire the first shoot. Of Mr. Hilton Cubitt I only know that I have hear she recover entirely, and that she still remain a widow, devote her whole life to the care of the poor and to the administration of her husband's estate. I HAVE intend \"The Adventure of the Abbey Grange\" to be the last of those exploit of my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, which I should ever communicate to the public. This resolution of mine be not due to any lack of material, since I have note of many hundred of case to which I have never allude, nor be it cause by any wan interest on the part of my reader in the singular personality and unique method of this remarkable man. The real reason lay in the reluctance which Mr. Holmes have show to the continue publication of his experience. So long a he be in actual professional practice the record of his success be of some practical value to him; but since he have definitely retire from London and betaken himself to study and bee-farm on the Sussex Down, notoriety have become hateful to him, and he have peremptorily request that his wish in this matter should be strictly observe. It be only upon my represent to him that I have give a promise that \"The Adventure of the Second Stain\" should be publish when the time be ripe, and point out to him that it be only appropriate that this long series of episode should culminate in the most important international case which he have ever be call upon to handle, that I at last succeed in obtain his consent that a carefully-guard account of the incident should at last be lay before the public. If in tell the story I seem to be somewhat vague in certain detail the public will readily understand that there be an excellent reason for my reticence. It be, then, in a year, and even in a decade, that shall be nameless, that upon one Tuesday morning in autumn we find two visitor of European fame within the wall of our humble room in Baker Street. The one, austere, high-nose, eagle-eye, and dominant, be none other than the illustrious Lord Bellinger, twice Premier of Britain. The other, dark, clear-cut, and elegant, hardly yet of middle age, and endow with every beauty of body and of mind, be the Right Honourable Trelawney Hope, Secretary for European Affair, and the most rise statesman in the country. They sit side by side upon our paper-litter settee, and it be easy to see from their wear and anxious face that it be business of the most press importance which have bring them. The Premier's thin, blue-vein hand be clasp tightly over the ivory head of his umbrella, and his gaunt, ascetic face look gloomily from Holmes to me. The European Secretary pull nervously at his mustache and fidget with the seal of his watch-chain. \"When I discover my loss, Mr. Holmes, which be at eight o'clock this morning, I at once inform the Prime Minister. It be at his suggestion that we have both come to you.\" \"Have you inform the police?\" \"No, sir,\" say the Prime Minister, with the quick, decisive manner for which he be famous. \"We have not do so, nor be it possible that we should do so. To inform the police must, in the long run, mean to inform the public. This be what we particularly desire to avoid.\" \"And why, sir?\" \"Because the document in question be of such immense importance that it publication might very easily--I might almost say probably--lead to European complication of the utmost moment. It be not too much to say that peace or war may hang upon the issue. Unless it recovery can be attend with the utmost secrecy, then it may a well not be recover at all, for all that be aim at by those who have take it be that it content should be generally know.\" \"I understand. Now, Mr. Trelawney Hope, I should be much oblige if you would tell me exactly the circumstance under which this document disappear.\" \"That can be do in a very few word, Mr. Holmes. The letter--for it be a letter from a foreign potentate--be receive six day ago. It be of such importance that I have never leave it in my safe, but I have take it across each even to my house in Whitehall Terrace, and keep it in my bedroom in a lock despatch-box. It be there last night. Of that I be certain. I actually open the box while I be dress for dinner, and saw the document inside. This morning it be go. The despatch-box have stand beside the glass upon my dress-table all night. I be a light sleeper, and so be my wife. We be both prepare to swear that no one could have enter the room during the night. And yet I repeat that the paper be go.\" \"What time do you dine?\" \"Half-past seven.\" \"How long be it before you go to bed?\" \"My wife have go to the theater. I wait up for her. It be half-past eleven before we go to our room.\" \"Then for four hour the despatch-box have lie unguarded?\" \"No one be ever permit to enter that room save the housemaid in the morning, and my valet, or my wife's maid, during the rest of the day. They be both trusty servant who have be with u for some time. Besides, neither of them could possibly have know that there be anything more valuable than the ordinary departmental paper in my despatch-box.\" \"Who do know of the existence of that letter?\" \"No one in the house.\" \"Surely your wife know?\" \"No, sir; I have say nothing to my wife until I miss the paper this morning.\" The Premier nod approvingly. \"I have long know, sir, how high be your sense of public duty,\" say he. \"I be convince that in the case of a secret of this importance it would rise superior to the most intimate domestic tie.\" The European Secretary bow. \"You do me no more than justice, sir. Until this morning I have never breathe one word to my wife upon this matter.\" \"Could she have guess?\" \"No, Mr. Holmes, she could not have guess--nor could anyone have guess.\" \"Have you lose any document before?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Who be there in England who do know of the existence of this letter?\" \"Each member of the Cabinet be inform of it yesterday; but the pledge of secrecy which attend every Cabinet meet be increase by the solemn warn which be give by the Prime Minister. Good heaven, to think that within"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "How's that?\" \"I shouldn't mention pay again. It look rather eager.\" \"It couldn't look a eager a I feel! But perhaps you be right. Now I'll read it straight through. 'two young adventurer for hire. Will to do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good. No unreasonable offer refuse.' How would that strike you if you read it?\" \"It would strike me a either be a hoax, or else write by a lunatic.\" \"It's not half so insane a a thing I read this morning begin 'Petunia' and sign 'Best Boy.'\" She tear out the leaf and hand it to Tommy. \"There you be. _Time_, I think. Reply to Box so-and-so. I expect it will be about five shill. Here's half a crown for my share.\" Tommy be hold the paper thoughtfully. His face burn a deeper red. \"Shall we really try it?\" he say at last. \"Shall we, Tuppence? Just for the fun of the thing?\" \"Tommy, you're a sport! I know you would be! Let's drink to success.\" She pour some cold dreg of tea into the two cup. \"Here's to our joint venture, and may it prosper!\" \"The Young Adventurer, Ltd.!\" respond Tommy. They put down the cup and laugh rather uncertainly. Tuppence rise. \"I must return to my palatial suite at the hostel.\" \"Perhaps it be time I stroll round to the _Ritz_,\" agree Tommy with a grin. \"Where shall we meet? And when?\" \"Twelve o'clock to-morrow. Piccadilly Tube station. Will that suit you?\" \"My time be my own,\" reply Mr. Beresford magnificently. \"So long, then.\" \"Good-bye, old thing.\" The two young people go off in opposite direction. Tuppence's hostel be situate in what be charitably call Southern Belgravia. For reason of economy she do not take a bus. She be half-way across St. James's Park, when a man's voice behind her make her start. \"Excuse me,\" it say. \"But may I speak to you for a moment?\" TUPPENCE turn sharply, but the word hover on the tip of her tongue remain unspoken, for the man's appearance and manner do not bear out her first and most natural assumption. She hesitate. A if he read her thought, the man say quickly: \"I can assure you I mean no disrespect.\" Tuppence believe him. Although she dislike and distrust him instinctively, she be incline to acquit him of the particular motive which she have at first attribute to him. She look him up and down. He be a big man, clean shave, with a heavy jowl. His eye be small and cunning, and shift their glance under her direct gaze. \"Well, what be it?\" she ask. The man smile. \"I happen to overhear part of your conversation with the young gentleman in Lyons'.\" \"Well--what of it?\" \"Nothing--except that I think I may be of some use to you.\" Another inference force itself into Tuppence's mind: \"You follow me here?\" \"I take that liberty.\" \"And in what way do you think you could be of use to me?\" The man take a card from his pocket and hand it to her with a bow. Tuppence take it and scrutinize it carefully. It bore the inscription, \"Mr. Edward Whittington.\" Below the name be the word \"Esthonia Glassware Co.,\" and the address of a city office. Mr. Whittington speak again: \"If you will call upon me to-morrow morning at eleven o'clock, I will lay the detail of my proposition before you.\" \"At eleven o'clock?\" say Tuppence doubtfully. \"At eleven o'clock.\" Tuppence make up her mind. \"Very well. I'll be there.\" \"Thank you. Good even.\" He raise his hat with a flourish, and walk away. Tuppence remain for some minute gaze after him. Then she give a curious movement of her shoulder, rather a a terrier shake himself. \"The adventure have begin,\" she murmur to herself. \"What do he want me to do, I wonder? There's something about you, Mr. Whittington, that I don't like at all. But, on the other hand, I'm not the least bite afraid of you. And a I've say before, and shall doubtless say again, little Tuppence can look after herself, thank you!\" And with a short, sharp nod of her head she walk briskly onward. A a result of further meditation, however, she turn aside from the direct route and enter a post office. There she ponder for some moment, a telegraph form in her hand. The think of a possible five shill spend unnecessarily spur I should suggest that we call upon him there a soon a possible. Shall we say after a bath and breakfast?\" It be arrange that Tuppence and Julius should return to the _Ritz_, and call for Sir Jam in the car. This program be faithfully carry out, and a little after eleven they draw up before the _Metropole_. They ask for Dr. Hall, and a page-boy go in search of him. In a few minute the little doctor come hurry towards them. \"Can you spare u a few minute, Dr. Hall?\" say Sir Jam pleasantly. \"Let me introduce you to Miss Cowley. Mr. Hersheimmer, I think, you already know.\" A quizzical gleam come into the doctor's eye a he shake hand with Julius. \"Ah, yes, my young friend of the tree episode! Ankle all right, eh?\" \"I guess it's cure owe to your skilful treatment, doc.\" \"And the heart trouble? Ha ha!\" \"Still search,\" say Julius briefly. \"To come to the point, can we have a word with you in private?\" ask Sir Jam. \"Certainly. I think there be a room here where we shall be quite undisturbed.\" He lead the way, and the others follow him. They sit down, and the doctor look inquiringly at Sir Jam. \"Dr. Hall, I be very anxious to find a certain young lady for the purpose of obtain a statement from her. I have reason to believe that she have be at one time or another in your establishment at Bournemouth. I hope I be transgress no professional etiquette in question you on the subject?\" \"I suppose it be a matter of testimony?\" Sir Jam hesitate a moment, then he reply: \"Yes.\" \"I shall be please to give you any information in my power. What be the young lady's name? Mr. Hersheimmer ask me, I remember----\" He half turn to Julius. \"The name,\" say Sir Jam bluntly, \"be really immaterial. She would be almost certainly send to you under an assume one. But I should like to know if you be acquaint with a Mr. Vandemeyer?\" \"Mr. Vandemeyer, of 20 South Audley Mansion? I know her slightly.\" \"You be not aware of what have happen?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"You do not know that Mr. Vandemeyer be dead?\" \"Dear, dear, I have no idea of it! When do it happen?\" \"She take an overdose of chloral last night.\" \"Purposely?\" \"Accidentally, it be believe. I should not like to say myself. Anyway, she be find dead this morning.\" \"Very sad. A singularly handsome woman. I presume she be a friend of yours, since you be acquaint with all these detail.\" \"I be acquaint with the detail because--well, it be I who find her dead.\" \"Indeed,\" say the doctor, start. \"Yes,\" say Sir Jam, and stroke his chin reflectively. \"This be very sad news, but you will excuse me if I say that I do not see how it bear on the subject of your inquiry?\" \"It bear on it in this way, be it not a fact that Mr. Vandemeyer commit a young relative of hers to your charge?\" Julius lean forward eagerly. \"That be the case,\" say the doctor quietly. \"Under the name of----?\" \"Janet Vandemeyer. I understand her to be a niece of Mr. Vandemeyer's.\" \"And she come to you?\" \"A far a I can remember in June or July of 1915.\" \"Be she a mental case?\" \"She be perfectly sane, if that be what you mean. I understand from Mr. Vandemeyer that the girl have be with her on the _Lusitania_ when that ill-fat ship be sink, and have suffer a severe shock in consequence.\" \"We're on the right track, I think?\" Sir Jam look round. \"A I say before, I'm a mutt!\" return Julius. The doctor look at them all curiously. \"You speak of want a statement from her,\" he say. \"Suppose she be not able to give one?\" \"What? You"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "In that sorry house it look a out of place a a diamond of the first water in a set of brass.

The aortic I may rely upon, but I should value your opinion upon the mitral.\" I listen to his heart, a request, but be unable to find anything amiss, save indeed that he be in an ecstasy of fear, for he shiver from head to foot. \"It appear to be normal,\" I say. \"You have no cause for uneasiness.\" \"You will excuse my anxiety, Miss Morstan,\" he remark, airily. \"I be a great sufferer, and I have long have suspicion a to that valve. I be delight to hear that they be unwarranted. Have your father, Miss Morstan, refrain from throw a strain upon his heart, he might have be alive now.\" I could have strike the man across the face, so hot be I at this callous and off-hand reference to so delicate a matter. Miss Morstan sit down, and her face grow white to the lip. \"I know in my heart that he be dead,\" say she. \"I can give you every information,\" say he, \"and, what be more, I can do you justice; and I will, too, whatever Brother Bartholomew may say. I be so glad to have your friend here, not only a an escort to you, but also a witness to what I be about to do and say. The three of u can show a bold front to Brother Bartholomew. But let u have no outsider,--no police or official. We can settle everything satisfactorily among ourselves, without any interference. Nothing would annoy Brother Bartholomew more than any publicity.\" He sit down upon a low settee and blink at u inquiringly with his weak, watery blue eye. \"For my part,\" say Holmes, \"whatever you may choose to say will go no further.\" I nod to show my agreement. \"That be well! That be well!\" say he. \"May I offer you a glass of Chianti, Miss Morstan? Or of Tokay? I keep no other win. Shall I open a flask? No? Well, then, I trust that you have no objection to tobacco-smoke, to the mild balsamic odor of the Eastern tobacco. I be a little nervous, and I find my hookah an invaluable sedative.\" He apply a taper to the great bowl, and the smoke bubble merrily through the rise-water. We sit all three in a semicircle, with our head advance, and our chin upon our hand, while the strange, jerky little fellow, with his high, shin head, puff uneasily in the center. \"When I first determine to make this communication to you,\" say he, \"I might have give you my address, but I fear that you might disregard my request and bring unpleasant people with you. I take the liberty, therefore, of make an appointment in such a way that my man Williams might be able to see you first. We wait long for news of the \"Lone Star\" of Savannah, but none ever reach u. We do at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shatter stern-post of a boat be see swing in the trough of a wave, with the letter \"L. S.\" carve upon it, and that be all which we shall ever know of the fate of the \"Lone Star.\" On glance over my note of the seventy odd case in which I have during the last eight year study the method of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, work a he do rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refuse to associate himself with any investigation which do not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic. Of all these vary case, however, I cannot recall any which present more singular feature than that which be associate with the well-know Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The event in question occur in the early day of my association with Holmes, when we be share room a bachelor in Baker Street. It be possible that I might have place them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy be make at the time, from which I have only be free during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge be give. It be perhaps a well that the fact should now come to light, for I have reason to know that there be widespread rumor a to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth. It be early in April in the year '83 that I wake one morning to find Sherlock Holmes stand, fully dress, by the side of my bed. He be a late riser, a a rule, and a the clock on the mantelpiece show me that it be only a quarter-past seven, I blink up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I be myself regular in my habit. \"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,\" say he, \"but it's the common lot this morning. Mr. Hudson have be knock up, she retort upon me, and I on you.\" \"What be it, then--a fire?\" \"No; a client. It seem that a young lady have arrive in a considerable state of excitement, who insist upon see me. She be wait now in the sit-room. Now, when young lady wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their bed, I presume that it be something very press which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an interest case, you would, I be sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I think, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance.\" \"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.\" I have no keener pleasure than in follow Holmes in his professional investigation, and in admire the rapid deduction, a swift a intuition, and yet always found on a logical basis with which he unravel the problem which be submit to him. I rapidly throw on my clothe and be ready in a few minute to accompany my friend down to the sit-room. A lady dress in black and heavily veil, who have be sit in the window, rise a we enter. \"Good-morning, madam,\" say Holmes cheerily. \"My name be Sherlock Holmes. This be my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak a freely a before myself. Ha! I be glad to see that Mr. Hudson have have the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you be shiver.\" \"It be not cold which make me shiver,\" say the woman in a low voice, change her seat a request. \"What, then?\" \"It be fear, Mr. Holmes. It be terror.\" She raise her veil a she speak, and we could see that she be indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all draw and gray, with restless frighten eye, like"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "Singleton promptly offer to make him, out of wire, a key to the galley door, so that he could get what he want from it.  The cook be to take an impression of the lock.  In exchange, Tom be to fetch him, from a hide place which Singleton designate in the forward house, a bottle of whiskey.  The cook be a shrewd mulatto, and he let Singleton make the key. It be after ten that morning when he bring it to me.  I be try to get the detail of his injury from Burn, at the time, in the tent.  \"I didn't see or hear anything, Leslie,\"  Burn say feebly.  \"I don't even remember be hit.  I felt there be some one behind me. That be all.\"  \"There have be nothing suspicious earlier in the night?\"  He lay think.  He be still somewhat confuse.  \"No--I think not.  Or--yes, I think once I saw some one stand by the mainmast--behind it.  It wasn't.\"  \"How long be Mr. John on deck?\"  \"Not long.\"  \"Do she ask you to do something for her?\"  Pale a he be, he colour; but he eye me honestly.  \"Yes.  Don't ask me any more, Leslie.  It have nothing to do with this.\"  \"What do she ask you to do?\" I persist remorselessly.  \"I don't want to talk; my head ache.\"  \"Very well.  Then I'll tell you what happen after I go off watch. No, I wasn't spy.  I know the woman, that's all.  She say you look tire, and wouldn't it be all right if you sit down for a moment and talk to her.\"  \"No; she say she be nervous.\"  \"The same thing--only better.  Then she persist in talk of the crime, and finally she say she would like to see the axe.  It wouldn't do any harm.  She, wouldn't touch it.\"  He watch me uneasily.  \"She didn't either,\" he say.  \"I'll swear to that, Leslie.  She didn't go near the bunk.  She cover her face with her hand, and lean against the door.  I think she be go to faint.\"  \"Against the door, of course!  And get an impression of the key. The door open in.  She could take out the key, press it against a cake of wax or even a cake of soap in her hand, and slip it back into the lock again while you--What be you do while she be do all that?\"  \"She drop her salt.  I pick them up.\"  \"Exactly!  Well, the axe be go.\"  He start up on his elbow.  \"Go!\"  \"Throw overboard, probably.  It be not in the cabin.\"  It be brutal, perhaps; but the situation be all of that.  A Burn fell back, colourless, Tom, the cook, bring into the tent the wire key that Singleton have make.  That morning I take from inside of Singleton's mattress a bunch of key, a long steel file, and the leg of one of his chair, carefully unscrew and wrap at the end with wire a formidable club.  One of the key open Singleton's door.  That be on Saturday.  Early Monday morning we sight land.      We pick up a pilot outside the Lewes breakwater a man of few word. I tell him only the outline of our storey, and I believe he half discredit me at first.  God know, I be not a creditable object. When I take him aft and show him the jolly-boat, he realise, at last, that he be face to face with a great tragedy, and pay it the tribute of throw away his cigar.  He suggest our raise the yellow plague flag; and this we do, with a ready response from the quarantine officer.  The quarantine officer come out in a power-boat, and mount the ladder; and from that moment my command of the Ella cease.  Turner, immaculately dress, pale, distinguish, member of the yacht club and partner in the Turner line, meet him at the rail, and conduct him, with a sort of chasten affability, to the cabin.  Exhaust from lack of sleep, terrify with what have go by and what be yet to come, unshaven and unkempt, the men gather on the forecastle-head and wait.  The conference below last perhaps an hour.  At the end of that time the quarantine officer come up and shout a direction from below, a a result of which the jolly-boat be cut loose, and, tow by the tug, take to the quarantine station.  There be an argument, I believe, between Turner and the officer, a to allow u to proceed up the river without wait for the police.  Turner prevail, however, and, from the time we hoist the yellow flag, we be on our way to the city, a tug pant beside u, urge the broad and comfortable line of the old cargo boat to a semblance of speed.  The quarantine officer, a dapper little man, remain on the boat, and busy himself officiously, get the name of the men, peer at Singleton through his bar window, and express disappointment at my lack of foresight in have the bloodstain clear away.  \"Every stain be a clue, my man, to the train eye,\" he chirrup. \"With an axe, too!  What a brutal method!  Brutal!  Where be the axe?\"  \"Go,\" I say patiently.  \"It be steal out of the captain's cabin.\"  He eye me over his glass.  \"That's very strange,\" he comment.  \"No stain, no axe!  You fellow have be mighty careful to destroy the evidence, haven't you?\"  All that long day we make our deliberate progress up the river. The luggage from the after house be carry up on deck by Adam and Clarke, and stand wait for the customhouse.  Turner, his hand behind him, pace the deck hour by hour, his heavy face colourless.  His wife, dark, repress, with a look of be always on guard, watch him furtively.  Mr. John, dress in black, talk to the doctor; and, from the note he make, I know she be tell the storey of the tragedy.  And here, there, and everywhere, efficient, normal, and so lovely that it hurt me to look at her, be Elsa. Williams, the butler, have emerge from his chrysalis of fright, and be ostentatiously look after the family's comfort.  No clearer indication could have be give of the new status of affair than his change attitude toward me.  He come up to me, early in the afternoon, and demand that I wash down the deck before the woman come up.  I smile down at him cheerfully.  \"Williams,\" I say, \"you be a coward--a mean, white-livered coward. You have skulk in the after house, behind woman, when there be man's work to do.  If I wash that deck, it will be with you a a mop.\"  He bluster something about speak to Mr. Turner and see that I do the work I be bring on board to do, and, see Turner's eye on u, finish his speech with an ugly epithet.  My nerve be strain to the utmost: lack of sleep and food have do their work. I be no longer in command of the Ella; I be a common sailor, ready to vent my spleen through my fist.  I knock him down with my open hand.  It be a barbarous and a reckless thing to do.  He pick himself up and limp away, mutter.  Turner have watch the scene with his cold blue eye, and the little doctor with his near-sight one.  \"A dangerous man, that!\" say the doctor.  \"Dangerous and intelligent,\" reply Turner.  \"A bad combination!\"  It be late that night when the Ella anchor in the river at Philadelphia.  We be not allow to land.  The police take charge of ship, crew, and passenger.  The men sleep heavily on deck, except Burn, who develop a slight fever from his injury, and move about restlessly.  It seem to me that the vigilance of the officer be exert largely to prevent an escape from the vessel, and not sufficiently for the safety of those on board.  I speak of this, and a guard be place at the companionway again.  Thus I saw Elsa Lee for the last time until the trial.  She be dress, a she have be in the afternoon, in a dark cloth suit of some sort, and I do not see her until I have speak to the"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "Yes, yes. You have find one?\" My interest be arouse. \"No, not that, sir. But since then I've remember what the young gentleman\"--John and Lawrence be still the \"young gentleman\" to Dorcas call the 'dress-up box.' It's up in the front attic, sir. A great chest, full of old clothe and fancy dress, and what not. And it come to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst them. So, if you'd tell the Belgian gentleman-- \"I will tell him, Dorcas,\" I promise. \"Thank you very much, sir. A very nice gentleman he be, sir. And quite a different class from them two detective from London, what go pry about, and ask question. I don't hold with foreigner a a rule, but from what the newspaper say I make out a how these brave Belges isn't the ordinary run of foreigner, and certainly he's a most polite speak gentleman.\" Dear old Dorcas! A she stand there, with her honest face upturned to mine, I think what a fine specimen she be of the old-fashion servant that be so fast die out. I think I might a well go down to the village at once, and look up Poirot; but I meet him half-way, come up to the house, and at once give him Dorcas's message. \"Ah, the brave Dorcas! We will look at the chest, although--but no matter--we will examine it all the same.\" We enter the house by one of the window. There be no one in the hall, and we go straight up to the attic. Sure enough, there be the chest, a fine old piece, all stud with brass nail, and full to overflow with every imaginable type of garment. Poirot bundle everything out on the floor with scant ceremony. There be one or two green fabric of vary shade; but Poirot shake his head over them all. He seem somewhat apathetic in the search, a though he expect no great result from it. Suddenly he give an exclamation. \"What be it?\" \"Look!\" The chest be nearly empty, and there, repose right at the bottom, be a magnificent black beard. \"_Oho!_\" say Poirot. \"_Oho!_\" He turn it over in his hand, examine it closely. \"New,\" he remark. \"Yes, quite new.\" After a moment's hesitation, he replace it in the chest, heap all the other thing on top of it a before, and make his way briskly downstairs. He go straight to the pantry, where we find Dorcas busily polish her silver. Poirot wish her good morning with Gallic politeness, and go on: \"We have be look through that chest, Dorcas. I be much oblige to you for mention it. There be, indeed, a fine collection there. Be they often use, may I ask?\" \"Well, sir, not very often nowadays, though from time to time we do have what the young gentleman call 'a dress-up night.' And very funny it be sometimes, sir. Mr. Lawrence, he's wonderful. Most comic! I shall never forget the night he come down a the Char of Persia, I think he call it--a sort of Eastern King it be. He have the big paper knife in his hand, and 'Mind, Dorcas,' he say, 'you'll have to be very respectful. This be my specially sharpen scimitar, and it's off with your head if I'm at all displease with you!' Miss Cynthia, she be what they call an Apache, or some such name--a Frenchify sort of cut-throat, I take it to be. A real sight she look. You'd never have believe a pretty young lady like that could have make herself into such a ruffian. Nobody would have know her.\" \"These even must have be great fun,\" say Poirot genially. \"I suppose Mr. Lawrence wear that fine black beard in the chest upstairs, when he be Shah of Persia?\" \"He do have a beard, sir,\" reply Dorcas, smile. \"And well I know it, for he borrow two skein of my black wool to make it with! And I'm sure it look wonderfully natural at a distance. I didn't know a there be a beard up there at all. It must have be get quite lately, I think. There be a red wig, I know, but nothing else in the way of hair. Burn cork they use mostly--though 'tis messy get it off again. Miss Cynthia be a nigger once, and, oh, the trouble she have.\" \"So Dorcas know nothing about that black beard,\" say Poirot thoughtfully, a we walk out into the hall again. \"Do you think it be _the_ one?\" I whisper eagerly. Poirot nod. \"I do. You notice it have be trim?\" \"No.\" \"Yes. It be cut exactly the shape of Mr. Inglethorp's, and I find one or two snip hair. Hastings, this affair be very deep.\" \"Who put it in the chest, I wonder?\" \"Someone with a good deal of intelligence,\" remark Poirot dryly. \"You realize that he choose the one place in the house to hide it where it presence would not be remark? Yes, he be intelligent. But we must be more intelligent. We must be so intelligent that he do not suspect u of be intelligent at all.\" I acquiesce. \"There, _mon ami_, you will be of great assistance to me.\" I be please with the compliment. There have be time when I hardly think that Poirot appreciate me at my true worth. \"Yes,\" he continue, star at me thoughtfully, \"you will be invaluable.\" This be naturally gratify, but Poirot's next word be not so welcome. \"I must have an ally in the house,\" he observe reflectively. \"You have me,\" I protest. \"True, but you be not sufficient.\" I be hurt, and show it. Poirot hurry to explain himself. \"You do not quite take my mean. You be know to be work with me. I want somebody who be not associate with u in any way.\" \"Oh, I see. How about John?\" \"No, I think not.\" \"The dear fellow isn't perhaps very bright,\" I say thoughtfully. \"Here come Miss Howard,\" say Poirot suddenly. \"She be the very person. But I be in her black book, since I clear Mr. Inglethorp. Still, we can but try.\" With a nod that be barely civil, Miss Howard assent to Poirot's request for a few minutes' conversation. We go into the little morning-room, and Poirot close the door. \"Well, Monsieur Poirot,\" say Miss Howard impatiently, \"what be it? Out with it. I'm busy.\" \"Do you remember, mademoiselle, that I once ask you to help me?\" \"Yes, I do.\" The lady nod. \"And I tell you I'd help you with pleasure--to hang Alfred Inglethorp.\" \"Ah!\" Poirot study her seriously. \"Miss Howard, I will ask you one question. I beg of you to reply to it truthfully.\" \"Never tell lie,\" reply Miss Howard. \"It be this. Do you still believe that Mr. Inglethorp be poison by her husband?\" \"What do you mean?\" she ask sharply. \"You needn't think your pretty explanation influence me in the slightest. I'll admit that it wasn't he who buy strychnine at the chemist's shop. What of that? I dare say he soak fly paper, a I tell you at the begin.\" \"That be arsenic--not strychnine,\" say Poirot mildly. \"What do that matter? Arsenic would put poor Emily out of the way just a well a strychnine. If I'm convince he do it, it doesn't matter a jot to me _how_ he do it.\" \"Exactly. _If_ you be convince he do it,\" say Poirot quietly. \"I will put my question in another form. Do you ever in your heart of heart believe that Mr. Inglethorp be poison by her husband?\" \"Good heaven!\" cry Miss Howard. \"Haven't I always tell you the man be a villain? Haven't I always tell you he would murder her in her bed? Haven't I always hat him like poison?\" \"Exactly,\" say Poirot. \"That bear out my little idea entirely.\" \"What little idea?\" \"Miss Howard, do you remember a conversation that take place on the day of my friend's arrival here? He repeat it to me, and there be a sentence of yours that have impress me very much. Do you remember affirm that if a crime have be commit, and anyone you love have be murder, you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the criminal"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "He then very methodically examine it all over with his double lens. \"It be paper of native Indian manufacture,\" he remark. \"It have at some time be pin to a board.

At one point be a small cross do in red ink, and above it be '3.37 from leave,' in fade pencil-write. In the leave-hand corner be a curious hieroglyphic like four cross in a line with their arm touch. Beside it be write, in very rough and coarse character, 'the sign of the four,--Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, Dost Akbar.' No, I confess that I do not see how this bear upon the matter. Yet it be evidently a document of importance. It have be keep carefully in a pocket-book; for the one side be a clean a the other.\" \"It be in his pocket-book that we find it.\" \"Preserve it carefully, then, Miss Morstan, for it may prove to be of use to u. I begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much deeper and more subtle than I at first suppose. I must reconsider my idea.\" He lean back in the cab, and I could see by his draw brow and his vacant eye that he be think intently. Miss Morstan and I chat in an undertone about our present expedition and it possible outcome, but our companion maintain his impenetrable reserve until the end of our journey. It be a September even, and not yet seven o'clock, but the day have be a dreary one, and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city. Mud-color cloud droop sadly over the muddy street. Down the Strand the lamp be but misty splotch of diffuse light which throw a feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement. The yellow glare from the shop-window stream out into the steamy, vaporous air, and throw a murky, shift radiance across the crowd thoroughfare. There be, to my mind, something eerie and ghost-like in the endless procession of face which flit across these narrow bar of light,--sad face and glad, haggard and merry. Like all human kind, they flit from the gloom into the light, and so back into the gloom once more. I be not subject to impression, but the dull, heavy even, with the strange business upon which we be engage, combine to make me nervous and depress. I could see from Miss Morstan's manner that she be suffer from the same feel. Holmes alone could rise superior to petty influence. He hold his open note-book upon his knee, and from time to time he jot down figure and memoranda in the light of his pocket-lantern. At the Lyceum Theatre the crowd be already thick at the side-entrance. In front a continuous stream of hansom and four-wheeler be rattle up, discharge their cargo of shirt-front men and beshawled, bediamonded woman. We have hardly reach the third pillar, which be our rendezvous, before a small, dark, brisk man in the dress of a coachman accost u. \"Be you the party who come with Miss Morstan?\" he ask. \"I be Miss Morstan, and these two gentleman be my friend,\" say she. He bend a pair of wonderfully penetrate and question eye upon u. \"You will excuse me, miss,\" he say with a certain dog manner, \"but I be to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companion be a police-officer.\" \"I give you my word on that,\" she answer. He give a shrill whistle, on which a street Arab lead across a four-wheeler and open the door. The man who have address u mount to the box, while we take our place inside. We have hardly do so before the driver whip up his horse, and we plunge away at a furious pace through the foggy street. The situation be a curious one. We be drive to an unknown place, on an unknown errand. Yet our invitation be either a complete hoax,--which be an inconceivable hypothesis,--or else we have good reason to think that important issue might hang upon our journey. Miss Morstan's demeanor be a resolute and collect a ever. I endeavor to cheer and amuse her by reminiscence of my adventure in Afghanistan; but, to tell the truth, I be myself so excite at our situation and so curious a to our destination that my story be slightly involve. To this day she declare that I tell her one move anecdote a to how a musket look into my tent at the dead of night, and how I fire a double-barrel tiger cub at it. At first I have some idea a to the direction in which we be drive; but soon, what with our pace, the fog, and my own limit knowledge of London, I lose my bear, and know nothing, save that we seem to be go a very long way. Sherlock Holmes be never at fault, however, and he mutter the name a the cab rattle through square and in and out by tortuous by-street. \"Rochester Row,\" say he. \"Now Vincent Square. Now we come out on the Vauxhall Bridge Road. We be make for the Surrey side, apparently. Yes, I think so. Now we be on the bridge. You can catch glimpse of the river.\" We do indeed get a fleet view of a stretch of the Thames with the lamp shin upon the broad, silent water; but our cab dash on, and be soon involve in a labyrinth of street upon the other side. \"Wordsworth Road,\" say my companion. \"Priory Road. Lark Hall Lane. Stockwell Place. Robert Street. Cold Harbor Lane. Our quest do not appear to take u to very fashionable region.\" We have, indeed, reach a questionable and forbid neighborhood. Long line of dull brick house be only relieve by the coarse glare and tawdry brilliancy of public house at the corner. Then come row of two-storied villa each with a front of miniature garden, and then again interminable line of new star brick build,--the monster tentacle which the giant city be throw out into the country. At last the cab draw up at the third house in a new terrace. None of the other house be inhabit, and that at which we stop be a dark a it neighbor, save for a single glimmer in the kitchen window. On our knock, however, the door be instantly throw open by a Hindoo servant clothe in a yellow turban, white loose-fit clothe, and a yellow sash. There be something strangely incongruous in this Oriental figure frame in the commonplace door-way of a third-rate suburban dwell-house. \"The Sahib await you,\" say he, and even a he speak there come a high pip voice from some inner room. \"Show them in to me, khitmutgar,\" it cry. \"Show them straight in to me.\" We follow the Indian down a sordid and common passage, ill light and worse furnish, until he come to a door upon the right, which he throw open. A blaze of yellow light stream out upon u, and in the center of the glare there stand a small man with a very high head, a bristle of red hair all round the fringe of it, and a bald, shin scalp which shoot out from among it like a mountain-peak from fir-tree. He writhe his hand together a he stand, and his feature be in a perpetual jerk, now smile, now scowl, but never for an instant in repose. Nature have give him a pendulous lip, and a too visible line of yellow and irregular teeth, which he strive feebly to conceal by constantly pas his hand over the lower part of his face. In spite of his obtrusive baldness, he give the impression of youth. In point of fact he have just turn his thirtieth year. \"Your servant, Miss Morstan,\" he keep repeat, in a thin, high voice. \"Your servant, gentleman. Pray step into my little sanctum. A small place, miss, but furnish to my own like. An oasis of art in the howl desert of South London.\" We be all astonish by the appearance of"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "She throw on a dress-gown, and open the door.  \"What be wrong?\"  I tell her, a gently a I could.  I think she would faint; but she pull herself together and look past me into the cabin.  \"That be--?\"  \"The captain, Mr. Turner.\"  \"And Mr. Vail?\"  \"In his cabin.\"  \"Where be Mr. Turner?\"  \"In his cabin, asleep.\"  She look at me strangely, and, leave the door, go into her sister's room, next.  I hear Miss Lee's low cry of horror, and almost immediately the two woman come to the doorway.  \"Have you see Mr. Turner?\" Miss Lee demand.  \"Just now.\"  \"Have Mr. John be tell?\"  \"Not yet.\"  She go herself to Mr. Johns's cabin, and knock.  She get an immediate answer, and Mr. John, partly dress, open the door.  \"What's the matter?\" she demand.  \"The whole crew be tramp outside my window.  I hope we haven't strike an iceberg.\"  \"Adele, don't faint, please.  Something awful have happen.\"  \"Turner!  He have kill some one finally!\"  \"Hush, for Heaven's sake!  Wilmer have be murder, Adele--and the captain.\"  Mr. John have le control than the other woman.  She stand for an instant, with a sort of horrible grin on her face.  Then she go down on the floor, full length, with a crash.  Elsa Lee kneel beside her and slide a pillow under her head.  \"Call the maid, Leslie,\" she say quietly.  \"Karen have something for this sort of thing.  Tell her to bring it quickly.\"  I go the length of the cabin and into the chartroom.  The maids' room be here, on the port-side, and thus aft of Mr. Turner's and Miss Lee's room.  It have one door only, and two small bar window, one above each of the two bunk.  I turn on the chart-room light.  At the top of the after companionway the crew have be assemble, and Burn be harangue them.  I knock at the maids' door, and, find it unlock, open it an inch or so.  \"Karen!\" I call--and, receive no answer: \"Mr. Sloane!\" (the stewardess).  I open the door wide and glance in.  Karen Hansen, the maid, be on the floor, dead.  The stewardess, in collapse from terror, be in her bunk, uninjured.      I go to the after companionway and call up to the men to send the first mate down; but Burn come instead.  \"Singleton's sick,\" he explain.  \"He's up there in a corner, with Oleson and Mcnamara hold him.\"  \"Burn,\" I say cautiously--\"I've find another!\"  \"God, not one of the woman!\"  \"One of the maid--Karen.\"  Burn be a young fellow about my own age, and to this point he have stand up well.  But he have be have a sort of flirtation with the girl, and I saw him go sick with horror.  He want to see her, when he have get command of himself; but I would not let him enter the room.  He stand outside, while I go in and carry out the stewardess, who be come to and moan.  I take her forward, and tell the three woman there what I have find.  Mr. John be better, and I find them all huddle in her room.  I put the stewardess on the bed, and lock the door into the next room. Then, after examine the window, I give Elsa Lee my revolver.  \"Don't let any one in,\" I say.  \"I'll put a guard at the two companionway, and we'll let no one down.  But keep the door lock also.\"  She take the revolver from me, and examine it with the air of one familiar with firearm.  Then she look up at me, her lip a white a her face.  \"We be rely on you, Leslie,\" she say.  And, at her word, the storm of self-contempt and bitterness that I have be hold in abeyance for the last half hour sweep over me like a flood.  I could have weep for fury.  \"Why should you trust me?\" I demand.  \"I sleep through the time when I be need.  And when I waken and find myself lock in the storeroom, I wait to take the lock off instead of break down the door!  I ought to jump overboard.\"  \"We be rely on you,\" she say again, simply; and I hear her fasten the door behind me a I go out.  Dawn be come a I join the crew, huddle around the wheel. There be nine men, count Singleton.  But Singleton hardly count.  He be in a state of profound mental and physical collapse.  The Ella be without an accredit officer, and, for lack of order to the contrary, the helmsman--Mcnamara now--be hold her to her course.  Burn have take Schwartz's place a second mate, but the situation be clearly beyond him.  Turner's condition be know and frankly discus.  It be clear that, for a time at least, we would have to get along without him.  Charlie Jones, always an influence among the men, voice the situation a we all stand together in the chill morning air:  \"What we want to do, boy,\" he say, \"be to make for the nearest port. This here be a police matter.\"  \"And a hang matter,\" someone else put in.  \"We've get to remember, boy, that this ain't like a crime on land. We've get the fellow that do it.  He's on the boat all right.\"  There be a stir among the men, and some of them look aft to where, guard by the Swede Oleson, Singleton be sit, his head in his hand.  \"And, what's more,\" Charlie Jones go on, \"I'm for put Leslie here in charge--for now, anyhow.  That's agreeable to you, be it, Burn?\"  \"But I don't know anything about a ship,\" I object.  \"I'm will enough, but I'm not competent.\"  I believe the thing have be discus before I go up, for Mcnamara speak up from the wheel.  \"We'll manage that somehow or other, Leslie,\" he say.  \"We want somebody to take charge, somebody with a head, that's all.  And since you ain't, in a manner of speak, be one of u, nobody's feel can't be hurt.  Ain't that it, boy?\"  \"That, and a matter of brain,\" say Burn.  \"But Singleton?\" I glance aft.  \"Singleton be go in iron,\" be the reply I get.  The light be stronger now, and I could see their face.  It be clear that the crew, or a majority of the crew, believe him guilty, and that, a far a Singleton be concern, my authority do not exist.  \"All right,\" I say.  \"I'll do the best I can.  First of all, I want every man to give up his weapon.  Burn!\"  \"Aye, aye.\"  \"Go over each man.  Leave them their pocket-knife; take everything else.\"  The men line up.  The situation be tense, horrible, so that the miscellaneous article from their pocket--knife, key, plug of chew tobacco, and here and there, among the foreign one, small comb for beard and moustache unexpectedly bring to light, cause a smile of pure reaction.  Two revolver from Oleson and Mcnamara and one nick razor from Adam complete the list of weapon we find.  The crew submit willingly.  They seem relieve to have some one to direct them, and the alacrity with which they obey my order show how they be suffer under the strain of inaction.  I go over to Singleton and put my hand on his shoulder.  \"I'm sorry, Mr. Singleton,\" I say, \"but I'll have to ask you for your revolver.\"  Without look at me, he draw it from his hip pocket and hold it out. I take it: It be load.  \"It's out of order,\" he say briefly.  \"If it have be work right, I wouldn't be here.\"  I reach down and touch his wrist.  His pulse be slow and rather faint, his hand cold.  \"Be there anything I can do for you?\"  \"Yes,\" he snarl.  \"You can get me a belay-pin and let me at those fool over there.  Turner do this, and you know it a well a I do!\"  I slide his revolver into my pocket, and go back to the men. Count Williams and the cook and myself, there be nine of u. The cook I count out, order him to go to the galley and prepare breakfast. The eight that be leave I divide into two watch, Burn take one and I"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "I'm--I'm worry, Mr. Sergeant. I think a woman from my house have be murder, but I don't know.\"  \"Murder,\" he say, and draw up his chair. \"Tell me about it.\"  I tell him everything, while he sit back with his eye half close, and his finger beat a tattoo on the arm of his chair.  When I finish he get up and go into an inner room. He come back in a moment.  \"I want you to come in and tell that to the chief,\" he say, and lead the way.  All tell, I repeat my storey three time that afternoon, to the sergeant, to the chief of police, and the third time to both the others and two detective.  The second time the chief make note of what I say.  \"Know this man Ladley?\" he ask the others. None of them do, but they all know of Jennie Brice, and some of them have see her in the theatre.  \"Get the theatre, Tom,\" the chief say to one of the detective.  Luckily, what he learn over the telephone from the theatre corroborate my storey. Jennie Brice be not in the cast that week, but should have report that morning (Monday) to rehearse the next week's piece. No message have be receive from her, and a substitute have be put in her place.  The chief hang up the receiver and turn to me. \"You be sure about the clock, Mr. Pitman?\" he ask. \"It be there when they move up-stair to the room?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"You be certain you will not find it on the parlour mantel when the water go down?\"  \"The mantel be uncover now. It be not there.\"  \"You think Ladley have go for good?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"He'd be a fool to try to run away, unless--Grave, you'd better get hold of the fellow, and keep him until either the woman be find or a body. The river be fall. In a couple of day we will know if she be around the premise anywhere.\"  Before I leave, I describe Jennie Brice for them carefully. Ask what she probably wear, if she have go away a her husband say, I have no idea; she have a lot of clothe, and dress a good bite. But I recall that I have see, lie on the bed, the black and white dress with the red collar, and they take that down, a well a the brown valise.  The chief rise and open the door for me himself. \"If she actually leave town at the time you mention,\" he say, \"she ought not to be hard to find. There be not many train before seven in the morning, and most of them be local.\"  \"And--and if she do not, if he--do you think she be in the house--or--or--the cellar?\"  \"Not unless Ladley be more of a fool than I think he be,\" he say, smile. \"Personally, I believe she have go away, a he say she do. But if she hasn't--He probably take the body with him when he say he be get medicine, and drop it in the current somewhere. But we must go slow with all this. There's no use shout 'wolf' yet.\"  \"But--the towel?\"  \"He may have cut himself, shave. It _have_ be do.\"  \"And the knife?\"  He shrug his shoulder good-naturedly.  \"I've see a perfectly good knife spoil open a bottle of pickle.\"  \"But the slipper? And the clock?\"  \"My good woman, enough shoe and slipper be forget in the bottom of cupboard year after year in flood-time, and be find float around the street, to make all the old-clothesmen in town happy. I have see almost everything float about, during one of these annual flood.\"  \"I dare say you never saw an onyx clock float around,\" I reply a little sharply. I have no sense of humour that day. He stop smile at once, and stand tug at his moustache.  \"No,\" he admit. \"An onyx clock sink, that's true. That's a very nice little point, that onyx clock. He may be try to sell it, or perhaps--\" He do not finish.  I go back immediately, only stop at the market to get meat for Mr. Reynolds' supper. It be after half past five and dusk be come on. I get a boat and be row directly home. Peter be not at the foot of the step. I pay the boatman and let him go, and turn to go up the stair. Some one be speak in the hall above.  I have read somewhere that no two voice be exactly alike, just a no two violin ever produce precisely the same sound. I think it be what they call the timbre that be different. I have, for instance, never hear a voice like Mr. Pitman's, although Mr. Harry Lauder's in a phonograph resemble it. And voice have always do for me what odour do for some people, revive forget scene and old memory. But the memory that the voice at the head of the stair bring back be not very old, although I have forget it. I seem to hear again, all at once, the lap of the water Sunday morning a it begin to come in over the door-sill; the sound of Terry rip up the parlour carpet, and Mr. Ladley call me a she-devil in the next room, in reply to this very voice.  But when I get to the top of the stair, it be only Mr. Howell, who have bring his visitor to the flood district, and on get her splash with the muddy water, have take her to my house for a towel and a cake of soap.  I light the lamp in the hall, and Mr. Howell introduce the girl. She be a pretty girl, slim and young, and she have take her wet good-naturedly.  \"I know we be intruder, Mr. Pitman,\" she say, hold out her hand. \"Especially now, when you be in trouble.\"  \"I have tell Miss Harvey a little,\" Mr. Howell say, \"and I promise to show her Peter, but he be not here.\"  I think I have know it be my sister's child from the moment I light the lamp. There be something of Alma in her, not Alma's hardness or haughtiness, but Alma's dark blue eye with black lash, and Alma's nose. Alma be always the beauty of the family. What with the day's excitement, and see Alma's child like this, in my house, I felt thing go round and clutch at the stair-rail. Mr. Howell catch me.  \"Why, Mr. Pitman!\" he say. \"What's the matter?\"  I get myself in hand in a moment and smile at the girl.  \"Nothing at all,\" I say. \"Indigestion, most likely. Too much tea the last day or two, and not enough solid food. I've be too anxious to eat.\"  Lida--for she be that to me at once, although I have never see her before--Lida be all sympathy and sweetness. She actually ask me to go with her to a restaurant and have a real dinner. I could imagine Alma, have she know! But I excuse myself.  \"I have to cook something for Mr. Reynolds,\" I say, \"and I'm better now, anyhow, thank you. Mr. Howell, may I speak to you for a moment?\"  He follow me along the back hall, which be dusk.  \"I have remember something that I have forget, Mr. Howell,\" I say. \"On Sunday morning, the Ladleys have a visitor.\"  \"Yes?\"  \"They have very few visitor.\"  \"I see.\"  \"I do not see him, but--I hear his voice.\" Mr. Howell do not move, but I fancy he draw his breath in quickly. \"It sound--it be not by any chance _you_?\"  \"I? A newspaper man, who go to bed at three A.M. on Sunday morning, up and about at ten!\"  \"I didn't say what time it be,\" I say sharply.  But at that moment Lida call from the front hall.  \"I think I hear Peter,\" she say. \"He be shut in somewhere, whine.\"  We go forward at once. She be right. Peter be scratch at the door of Mr. Ladley's room, although I have leave the door close and Peter in the hall. I let him out, and he crawl to me on three leg"}, {"label": "rinehart", "text": "On Burns's watch be Clarke, Mcnamara, and Williams; on mine, Oleson, Adam, and Charlie Jones.  It be two bell, or five o'clock.  Burn strike the gong sharply a an indication that order, of a sort, have be restore.  The rise sun be gleam on the sail; the grey surface of the sea be ruffle under the morning breeze.  From the galley a thin stream of smoke be rise.  Some of the horror of the night go with the darkness, but the think of what wait in the cabin below be on u all.  I suggest another attempt to rouse Mr. Turner, and Burn and Clarke go below.  They come back in ten minute, report no change in Turner's condition.  There be open grumble among the men at the situation, but we be helpless.  Burn and I decide to go on a if Turner be not on board, until he be in condition to take hold.  We think it best to bring up the body while all the crew be on duty, and then to take up the watch.  I arrange to have one man constantly on guard in the after house--a difficult matter where all be under suspicion.  Burn suggest Charlie Jones a probably the most reliable, and I give him the revolver I have take from Singleton. It be useless, but it make at least a show of authority. The rest of the crew, except Oleson, on guard over the mate, be detail to assist in carry up the three body.  Williams be take along to get sheet from the linen room.  We bring the captain up first, lay him on a sheet on the deck and fold the edge over him.  It be terrible work.  Even I, fresh from a medical college, grow nauseate over it.  He be heavy. It be slow work, get him up.  Vail we bring up in the sheet from his bunk. Of the three, he be the most mutilate.  The maid Karen show only one injury, a smash blow on the head, probably from the head of the axe.  For axe it have be, beyond a doubt.  I put Williams to work below to clear away every evidence of what have happen.  He go down, ashy-face, only to rush up again, refuse to stay alone.  I send Clarke with him, and instruct Charlie Jones to keep them there until the cabin be in order.  At three bell the cook bring coffee, and some of the men take it. I try to swallow, but it choke me.  Burn have serve a second mate on a sail vessel, and think he could take u back, at least into more travel water.  We decide to head back to New York.  I get the code book from the captain's cabin, and we agree to run up the flag, union down, if any other vessel come in sight.  I get the code word for \"Mutiny--need assistance,\" and I ask the mate if he would signal if a vessel come near enough.  But he turn sullen and refuse to answer.  I find it hard to recap calmly the event of that morning: the three still and shroud figure, prone on deck; the crew, bareheaded, stand around, eye each other stealthily, with panic ready to leap free and grip each of them by the throat; the grim determination, the reason for which I do not yet know, to put the first mate in iron; and, over all, the clear sunrise of an August morning on the ocean, rail and deck gleam, an odour of coffee in the air, the joyous lift and splash of the bowsprit a the Ella, head back on her course, seem to make for home like a nag for the stable.  Surely none of these men, some weep, all grieve, could be the fiend who have commit the crime.  One by one, I look in their face--at Burn, youngest member of the crew, a blue-eye, sandy-haired Scot; at Clarke and Adam and Charlie Jones, old in the service of the Turner line; at Mcnamara, a shrewd little Irishman; at Oleson the Swede.  And, in spite of myself, I could not help compare them with the heavy-shoulder, sodden-face man below in his cabin, the owner of the ship.  One explanation come to me, and I leap at it--the possibility of a stowaway hide in the hold, some maniacal fugitive who have find in the little cargo boat's empty hull ample room to hide.  The men, too, seize at the idea.  One and all volunteer for what might prove to be a dangerous service.  I choose Charlie Jones and Clarke a be most familiar with the ship, and we go down into the hold.  Clarke carry a lantern.  Charlie Jones hold Singleton's break revolver.  I carry a belay pin. But, although we search every foot of space, we find nothing.  The formaldehyde with which Turner have fumigate the ship cling here tenaciously, and, mix with the odour of bilge water and the indescribable heavy smell leave by tropical cargo, make me dizzy and ill.  We be stumble along, Clarke with the lantern, I next, and Charlie Jones behind, on our way to the ladder again, when I receive a stun blow on the back of the head.  I turn dizzy, expect nothing le than sudden death, when it develop that Jones, have stumble over a loose plank, have fall forward, the revolver in his outstretched hand strike my head.  He pick himself up sheepishly, and we go on.  But so unnerve be I by this fresh shock that it be a moment or two before I could essay the ladder.  Burn be wait at the hatchway, peer down.  Beside him on the deck lay a bloodstained axe.  Elsa Lee, on hear the storey of Henrietta Sloane, have go to the maids' cabin, and have find it where it have be fling into the berth of the stewardess.      But, after all, the storey of Henrietta Sloane only add to the mystery.  She tell it to me, sit prop in a chair in Mr. Johns's room, her face white, her lip dry and twitch.  The crew be make such breakfast a they could on deck, and Mr. Turner be still in a stupor in his room across the main cabin.  The four woman, draw together in their distress, be huddle in the centre of the room, touch hand now and then, a if find comfort in contact, and reassurance.  \"I go to bed early,\" say the stewardess; \"about ten o'clock, I think.  Karen have not come down; I waken when the watch change. It be hot, and the window from our room to the deck be open.  There be a curtain over it, to keep the helmsman from look in--it be close to the wheel.  The bell, strike every half-hour, do not waken me any more, although it do at first.  It be just outside the window.  But I hear the watch change.  I hear eight bell strike, and the lookout man on the forecastle head call, 'All's well.'  \"I sit up and turn on the light.  Karen have not come down, and I be alarm.  She have be--have be flirt a little with one of the sailor, and I have warn her that it would not do.  She'd be find out and get into trouble.  \"The only way to reach our cabin be through the chart-room, and when I open the door an inch or two, I saw why Karen have not come down.  Mr. Turner and Mr. Singleton be sit there.  They be--\" She hesitate.  \"Please go on,\" say Mr. Turner.  \"They be drink?\"  \"Yes, Mr. Turner.  And Mr. Vail be there, too.  He be say that the captain would come down and there would be more trouble.  I shut the door and stand just inside, listen.  Mr. Singleton say he hop the captain would come--that he and Mr. Turner only want a chance to get at him.\"  Miss Lee lean forward and search the stewardess's face with strain eye.  \"You be sure that he mention Mr. Turner in that?\"  \"That be exactly what he say, Miss Lee. She do not see Mr. Ladley at the time, but hear her in the next room. They be apparently reconcile: Mr. Pitman report Mr. Ladley"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "She might have burn the new one, mistake it for the earlier one in his favor. She be so terribly bitter against him.\" \"You consider her vehemence unnatural?\" \"Y--e. She be so very violent. I wonder really whether she be quite sane on that point.\" Poirot shake his head energetically. \"No, no, you be on a wrong tack there. There be nothing weak-mind or degenerate about Miss Howard. She be an excellent specimen of well-balance English beef and brawn. She be sanity itself.\" \"Yet her hatred of Inglethorp seem almost a mania. My idea be--a very ridiculous one, no doubt--that she have intend to poison him--and that, in some way, Mr. Inglethorp get hold of it by mistake. But I don't at all see how it could have be do. The whole thing be absurd and ridiculous to the last degree.\" \"Still you be right in one thing. It be always wise to suspect everybody until you can prove logically, and to your own satisfaction, that they be innocent. Now, what reason be there against Miss Howard's have deliberately poison Mr. Inglethorp?\" \"Why, she be devote to her!\" I exclaim. \"Tcha! Tcha!\" cry Poirot irritably. \"You argue like a child. If Miss Howard be capable of poison the old lady, she would be quite equally capable of simulate devotion. No, we must look elsewhere. You be perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against Alfred Inglethorp be too violent to be natural; but you be quite wrong in the deduction you draw from it. I have draw my own deduction, which I believe to be correct, but I will not speak of them at present.\" He pause a minute, then go on. \"Now, to my way of think, there be one insuperable objection to Miss Howard's be the murder.\" \"And that be?\" \"That in no possible way could Mr. Inglethorp's death benefit Miss Howard. Now there be no murder without a motive.\" I reflect. \"Could not Mr. Inglethorp have make a will in her favor?\" Poirot shake his head. \"But you yourself suggest that possibility to Mr. Well?\" Poirot smile. \"That be for a reason. I do not want to mention the name of the person who be actually in my mind. Miss Howard occupy very much the same position, so I use her name instead.\" \"Still, Mr. Inglethorp might have do so. Why, that will, make on the afternoon of her death may-- But Poirot's shake of the head be so energetic that I stop. \"No, my friend. I have certain little idea of my own about that will. But I can tell you this much--it be not in Miss Howard's favor.\" I accept his assurance, though I do not really see how he could be so positive about the matter. \"Well,\" I say, with a sigh, \"we will acquit Miss Howard, then. It be partly your fault that I ever come to suspect her. It be what you say about her evidence at the inquest that set me off.\" Poirot look puzzle. \"What do I say about her evidence at the inquest?\" \"Don't you remember? When I cite her and John Cavendish a be above suspicion?\" \"Oh--ah--yes.\" He seem a little confuse, but recover himself. \"By the way, Hastings, there be something I want you to do for me.\" \"Certainly. What be it?\" \"Next time you happen to be alone with Lawrence Cavendish, I want you to say this to him. 'I have a message for you, from Poirot. He say: \"Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace!\"' Nothing more. Nothing le.\" \"'Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.' Be that right?\" I ask, much mystify. \"Excellent.\" \"But what do it mean?\" \"Ah, that I will leave you to find out. You have access to the fact. Just say that to him, and see what he say.\" \"Very well--but it's all extremely mysterious.\" We be run into Tadminster now, and Poirot direct the car to the \"Analytical Chemist.\" Poirot hop down briskly, and go inside. In a few minute he be back again. \"There,\" he say. \"That be all my business.\" \"What be you do there?\" I ask, in lively curiosity. \"I leave something to be analyze.\" \"Yes, but what?\" \"The sample of cocoa I take from the saucepan in the bedroom.\" \"But that have already be test!\" I cry, stupefy. \"Dr. Bauerstein have it test, and you yourself laugh at the possibility of there be strychnine in it.\" \"I know Dr. Bauerstein have it test,\" reply Poirot quietly. \"Well, then?\" \"Well, I have a fancy for have it analyze again, that be all.\" And not another word on the subject could I drag out of him. This proceed of Poirot's, in respect of the cocoa, puzzle me intensely. I could see neither rhyme nor reason in it. However, my confidence in him, which at one time have rather wan, be fully restore since his belief in Alfred Inglethorp's innocence have be so triumphantly vindicate. The funeral of Mr. Inglethorp take place the follow day, and on Monday, a I come down to a late breakfast, John draw me aside, and inform me that Mr. Inglethorp be leave that morning, to take up his quarter at the Stylite Arm until he should have complete his plan. \"And really it's a great relief to think he's go, Hastings,\" continue my honest friend. \"It be bad enough before, when we think he'd do it, but I'm hang if it isn't worse now, when we all feel guilty for have be so down on the fellow. The fact be, we've treat him abominably. Of course, thing do look black against him. I don't see how anyone could blame u for jump to the conclusion we do. Still, there it be, we be in the wrong, and now there's a beastly feel that one ought to make amend; which be difficult, when one doesn't like the fellow a bite better than one do before. The whole thing's damn awkward! And I'm thankful he's have the tact to take himself off. It's a good thing Style wasn't the mater's to leave to him. Couldn't bear to think of the fellow lord it here. He's welcome to her money.\" \"You'll be able to keep up the place all right?\" I ask. \"Oh, yes. There be the death duty, of course, but half my father's money go with the place, and Lawrence will stay with u for the present, so there be his share a well. We shall be pinch at first, of course, because, a I once tell you, I be in a bite of a hole financially myself. Still, the Johnny will wait now.\" In the general relief at Inglethorp's approach departure, we have the most genial breakfast we have experience since the tragedy. Cynthia, whose young spirit be naturally buoyant, be look quite her pretty self again, and we all, with the exception of Lawrence, who seem unalterably gloomy and nervous, be quietly cheerful, at the open of a new and hopeful future. The paper, of course, have be full of the tragedy. Glare headline, sandwich biography of every member of the household, subtle innuendo, the usual familiar tag about the police have a clue. Nothing be spar u. It be a slack time. The war be momentarily inactive, and the newspaper seize with avidity on this crime in fashionable life: \"The Mysterious Affair at Style\" be the topic of the moment. Naturally it be very annoy for the Cavendish. The house be constantly besiege by reporter, who be consistently deny admission, but who continue to haunt the village and the ground, where they lay in wait with camera, for any unwary member of the household. We all live in a blast of publicity. The Scotland Yard men come and go, examine, question, lynx-eye and reserve of tongue. Towards what end they be work, we do not know. Have they any clue, or would the whole thing remain in the category of undiscovered crime? After breakfast, Dorcas come up to me rather mysteriously, and ask if she might have a few word with me. \"Certainly. What be it, Dorcas?\" \"Well, it's just this, sir. You'll be see the Belgian gentleman to-day perhaps?\" I nod. \"Well, sir, you know how he ask"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "would be mere waste of labor. Accordingly, he wish them goodbye, and they leave the hotel. For a few minute they stand by the car talk. \"How madden,\" cry Tuppence. \"To think that Julius must have be actually under the same roof with her for a few hour.\" \"I be a darn idiot,\" mutter Julius gloomily. \"You couldn't know,\" Tuppence console him. \"Could he?\" She appeal to Sir Jam. \"I should advise you not to worry,\" say the latter kindly. \"No use cry over spill milk, you know.\" \"The great thing be what to do next,\" add Tuppence the practical. Sir Jam shrug his shoulder. \"You might advertise for the nurse who accompany the girl. That be the only course I can suggest, and I must confess I do not hope for much result. Otherwise there be nothing to be do.\" \"Nothing?\" say Tuppence blankly. \"And--Tommy?\" \"We must hope for the best,\" say Sir Jam. \"Oh yes, we must go on hop.\" But over her downcast head his eye meet Julius's, and almost imperceptibly he shake his head. Julius understand. The lawyer consider the case hopeless. The young American's face grow grave. Sir Jam take Tuppence's hand. \"You must let me know if anything further come to light. Letter will always be forward.\" Tuppence star at him blankly. \"You be go away?\" \"I tell you. Don't you remember? To Scotland.\" \"Yes, but I think----\" The girl hesitate. Sir Jam shrug his shoulder. \"My dear young lady, I can do nothing more, I fear. Our clue have all end in thin air. You can take my word for it that there be nothing more to be do. If anything should arise, I shall be glad to advise you in any way I can.\" His word give Tuppence an extraordinarily desolate feel. \"I suppose you're right,\" she say. \"Anyway, thank you very much for try to help u. Good-bye.\" Julius be bend over the car. A momentary pity come into Sir James's keen eye, a he gaze into the girl's downcast face. \"Don't be too disconsolate, Miss Tuppence,\" he say in a low voice. \"Remember, holiday-time isn't always all playtime. One sometimes manage to put in some work a well.\" Something in his tone make Tuppence glance up sharply. He shake his head with a smile. \"No, I shan't say any more. Great mistake to say too much. Remember that. Never tell all you know--not even to the person you know best. Understand? Good-bye.\" He stride away. Tuppence star after him. She be begin to understand Sir James's method. Once before he have throw her a hint in the same careless fashion. Be this a hint? What exactly lay behind those last brief word? Do he mean that, after all, he have not abandon the case; that, secretly, he would be work on it still while---- Her meditation be interrupt by Julius, who adjure her to \"get right in.\" \"You're look kind of thoughtful,\" he remark a they start off. \"Do the old guy say anything more?\" Tuppence open her mouth impulsively, and then shut it again. Sir James's word sound in her ear: \"Never tell all you know--not even to the person you know best.\" And like a flash there come into her mind another memory. Julius before the safe in the flat, her own question and the pause before his reply, \"Nothing.\" Be there really nothing? Or have he find something he wish to keep to himself? If he could make a reservation, so could she. \"Nothing particular,\" she reply. She felt rather than saw Julius throw a sideways glance at her. \"Say, shall we go for a spin in the park?\" \"If you like.\" For a while they run on under the tree in silence. It be a beautiful day. The keen rush through the air bring a new exhilaration to Tuppence. \"Say, Miss Tuppence, do you think I'm ever go to find Jane?\" Julius speak in a discourage voice. The mood be so alien to him that Tuppence turn and star at him in surprise. He nod. \"That's so. I'm get down and out over the business. Sir Jam to-day hadn't get any hope at all, I could see that. I don't like him--we don't gee together somehow--but he's pretty cute, and I guess he wouldn't quit if there be any chance of success--now, would he?\" Tuppence felt rather uncomfortable, but cling to her belief that Julius also have withhold something from her, she remain firm. \"He suggest advertise for the nurse,\" she remind him. \"Yes, with a 'forlorn hope' flavor to his voice! No--I'm about feed up. I've half a mind to go back to the State right away.\" \"Oh no!\" cry Tuppence. \"We've get to find Tommy.\" \"I sure forget Beresford,\" say Julius contritely. \"That's so. We must find him. But after--well, I've be day-dream ever since I start on this trip--and these dream be rotten poor business. I'm quit of them. Say, Miss Tuppence, there's something I'd like to ask you.\" \"Yes?\" \"You and Beresford. What about it?\" \"I don't understand you,\" reply Tuppence with dignity, add rather inconsequently: \"And, anyway, you're wrong!\" \"Not get a sort of kindly feel for one another?\" \"Certainly not,\" say Tuppence with warmth. \"Tommy and I be friend--nothing more.\" \"I guess every pair of lover have say that sometime or another,\" observe Julius. \"Nonsense!\" snap Tuppence. \"Do I look the sort of girl that's always fall in love with every man she meet?\" \"You do not. You look the sort of girl that's mighty often get fall in love with!\" \"Oh!\" say Tuppence, rather take aback. \"That's a compliment, I suppose?\" \"Sure. Now let's get down to this. Suppose we never find Beresford and--and----\" \"All right--say it! I can face fact. Suppose he's--dead! Well?\" \"And all this business fiddle out. What be you go to do?\" \"I don't know,\" say Tuppence forlornly. \"You'll be darn lonesome, you poor kid.\" \"I shall be all right,\" snap Tuppence with her usual resentment of any kind of pity. \"What about marriage?\" inquire Julius. \"Get any view on the subject?\" \"I intend to marry, of course,\" reply Tuppence. \"That be, if\"--she pause, know a momentary long to draw back, and then stick to her gun bravely--\"I can find some one rich enough to make it worth my while. That's frank, isn't it? I dare say you despise me for it.\" \"I never despise business instinct,\" say Julius. \"What particular figure have you in mind?\" \"Figure?\" ask Tuppence, puzzle. \"Do you mean tall or short?\" \"No. Sum--income.\" \"Oh, I--I haven't quite work that out.\" \"What about me?\" _\"You? \"_ \"Sure thing.\" \"Oh, I couldn't!\" \"Why not?\" \"I tell you I couldn't.\" \"Again, why not?\" \"It would seem so unfair.\" \"I don't see anything unfair about it. I call your bluff, that's all. I admire you immensely, Miss Tuppence, more than any girl I've ever meet. You're so darn plucky. I'd just love to give you a real, rattle good time. Say the word, and we'll run round right away to some high-class jeweler, and fix up the ring business.\" \"I can't,\" gasp Tuppence. \"Because of Beresford?\" \"No, no, _no!_\" \"Well then?\" Tuppence merely continue to shake her head violently. \"You can't reasonably expect more dollar than I've get.\" \"Oh, it isn't that,\" gasp Tuppence with an almost hysterical laugh. \"But thank you very much, and all that, I think I'd better say no.\" \"I'd be oblige if you'd do me the favor to think it over until to-morrow.\" \"It's no use.\" \"Still, I guess we'll leave it like that.\" \"Very well,\" say Tuppence meekly. Neither of them speak again until they reach the _Ritz_. Tuppence go upstairs to her room. She felt morally batter to the grind after her conflict with Julius's vigorous personality. Sit down in front of the glass, she star at her own reflection for some minute. \"Fool,\" murmur Tuppence at length, make a grimace. \"Little fool. Everything you want--everything you've ever hop for, and you go and bleat out 'no' like an idiotic little sheep. It's your one chance. Why don't you take it? Grab it? Snatch at it? What more do you want?\" A if in answer to her own question, her eye fell on"}, {"label": "christie", "text": "He be quite a young general!\" \"What blighter be that?\" inquire Tommy. \"Perfectly sicken the way those brass hat drive from the War Office to the _Savoy_, and from the _Savoy_ to the War Office!\" \"I've forget his name now,\" confess Tuppence. \"To resume, that be in a way the apex of my career. I next enter a Government office. We have several very enjoyable tea party. I have intend to become a land girl, a postwoman, and a bus conductress by way of round off my career--but the Armistice intervene! I cling to the office with the true limpet touch for many long month, but, ala, I be comb out at last. Since then I've be look for a job. Now then--your turn.\" \"There's not so much promotion in mine,\" say Tommy regretfully, \"and a great deal le variety. I go out to France again, a you know. Then they send me to Mesopotamia, and I get wound for the second time, and go into hospital out there. Then I get stick in Egypt till the Armistice happen, kick my heel there some time longer, and, a I tell you, finally get demob. And, for ten long, weary month I've be job hunt! There aren't any job! And, if there be, they wouldn't give 'em to me. What good be I? What do I know about business? Nothing.\" Tuppence nod gloomily. \"What about the colony?\" she suggest. Tommy shake his head. \"I shouldn't like the colony--and I'm perfectly certain they wouldn't like me!\" \"Rich relation?\" Again Tommy shake his head. \"Oh, Tommy, not even a great-aunt?\" \"I've get an old uncle who's more or le roll, but he's no good.\" \"Why not?\" \"Want to adopt me once. I refuse.\" \"I think I remember hear about it,\" say Tuppence slowly. \"You refuse because of your mother----\" Tommy flush. \"Yes, it would have be a bite rough on the mater. A you know, I be all she have. Old boy hat her--want to get me away from her. Just a bite of spite.\" \"Your mother's dead, isn't she?\" say Tuppence gently. Tommy nod. Tuppence's large gray eye look misty. \"You're a good sort, Tommy. I always know it.\" \"Rot!\" say Tommy hastily. \"Well, that's my position. I'm just about desperate.\" \"So be I! I've hang out a long a I could. I've tout round. I've answer advertisement. I've try every mortal bless thing. I've screw and save and pinch! But it's no good. I shall have to go home!\" \"Don't you want to?\" \"Of course I don't want to! What's the good of be sentimental? Father's a dear--I'm awfully fond of him--but you've no idea how I worry him! He have that delightful early Victorian view that short skirt and smoke be immoral. You can imagine what a thorn in the flesh I be to him! He just heave a sigh of relief when the war take me off. You see, there be seven of u at home. It's awful! All housework and mothers' meet! I have always be the changeling. I don't want to go back, but--oh, Tommy, what else be there to do?\" Tommy shake his head sadly. There be a silence, and then Tuppence burst out: \"Money, money, money! I think about money morning, noon and night! I dare say it's mercenary of me, but there it be!\" \"Same here,\" agree Tommy with feel. \"I've think over every imaginable way of get it too,\" continue Tuppence. \"There be only three! To be leave it, to marry it, or to make it. First be rule out. I haven't get any rich elderly relative. Any relative I have be in home for decay gentlewoman! I always help old lady over cross, and pick up parcel for old gentleman, in case they should turn out to be eccentric millionaire. But not one of them have ever ask me my name--and quite a lot never say 'thank you.'\" There be a pause. \"Of course,\" resume Tuppence, \"marriage be my best chance. I make up my mind to marry money when I be quite young. Any think girl would! I'm not sentimental, you know.\" She pause. \"Come now, you can't say I'm sentimental,\" she add sharply. \"Certainly not,\" agree Tommy hastily. \"No one would ever think of sentiment in connection with you.\" \"That's not very polite,\" reply Tuppence. \"But I dare say you mean it all right. Well, there it be! I'm ready and will--but I never meet any rich men! All the boy I know be about a hard up a I be.\" \"What about the general?\" inquire Tommy. \"I fancy he keep a bicycle shop in time of peace,\" explain Tuppence. \"No, there it be! Now _you_ could marry a rich girl.\" \"I'm like you. I don't know any.\" \"That doesn't matter. You can always get to know one. Now, if I see a man in a fur coat come out of the _Ritz_ I can't rush up to him and say: 'Look here, you're rich. I'd like to know you.'\" \"Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garb female?\" \"Don't be silly. You tread on her foot, or pick up her handkerchief, or something like that. If she think you want to know her she's flatter, and will manage it for you somehow.\" \"You overrate my manly charm,\" murmur Tommy. \"On the other hand,\" proceed Tuppence, \"my millionaire would probably run for his life! No--marriage be fraught with difficulty. Remain--to _make_ money!\" \"We've try that, and fail,\" Tommy remind her. \"We've try all the orthodox way, yes. But suppose we try the unorthodox. Tommy, let's be adventurer!\" \"Certainly,\" reply Tommy cheerfully. \"How do we begin?\" \"That's the difficulty. If we could make ourselves know, people might hire u to commit crime for them.\" \"Delightful,\" comment Tommy. \"Especially come from a clergyman's daughter!\" \"The moral guilt,\" Tuppence point out, \"would be theirs--not mine. You must admit that there's a difference between steal a diamond necklace for yourself and be hire to steal it.\" \"There wouldn't be the least difference if you be catch!\" \"Perhaps not. But I shouldn't be catch. I'm so clever.\" \"Modesty always be your beset sin,\" remark Tommy. \"Don't rag. Look here, Tommy, shall we really? Shall we form a business partnership?\" \"Form a company for the steal of diamond necklace?\" \"That be only an illustration. Let's have a--what do you call it in book-keep?\" \"Don't know. Never do any.\" \"I have--but I always get mix up, and use to put credit entry on the debit side, and vice versa--so they fire me out. Oh, I know--a joint venture! It strike me a such a romantic phrase to come across in the middle of musty old figure. It's get an Elizabethan flavor about it--make one think of galleon and doubloon. A joint venture!\" \"Trade under the name of the Young Adventurer, Ltd.? Be that your idea, Tuppence?\" \"It's all very well to laugh, but I feel there might be something in it.\" \"How do you propose to get in touch with your would-be employer?\" \"Advertisement,\" reply Tuppence promptly. \"Have you get a bite of paper and a pencil? Men usually seem to have. Just like we have hairpin and powder-puff.\" Tommy hand over a rather shabby green notebook, and Tuppence begin write busily. \"Shall we begin: 'Young officer, twice wound in the war----'\" \"Certainly not.\" \"Oh, very well, my dear boy. But I can assure you that that sort of thing might touch the heart of an elderly spinster, and she might adopt you, and then there would be no need for you to be a young adventurer at all.\" \"I don't want to be adopt.\" \"I forget you have a prejudice against it. I be only rag you! The paper be full up to the brim with that type of thing. Now listen--how's this? 'two young adventurer for hire. Will to do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good.' (We might a well make that clear from the start.) Then we might add: 'No reasonable offer refuse'--like flat and furniture.\" \"I should think any offer we get in answer to that would be a pretty _un_reasonable one!\" \"Tommy! You're a genius! That's ever so much more chic. 'No unreasonable offer"}]
