arise from him he be sit fully dress in an easy chair with a slip of paper which look like a map upon his knee and his forehead sink forward upon his hand in deep think i stand dumb with astonishment watch him from the darkness a small taper on the edge of the table shed a feeble light which suffice to show me that he be fully dress suddenly a i look he rise from his chair and walk over to a bureau at the side he unlock it and draw out one of the drawer from this he take a paper and return to his seat he flatten it out beside the taper on the edge of the table and begin to study it with minute attention my indignation at this calm examination of our family document overcome me so far that i take a step forward and brunton look up saw me stand in the doorway he spring to his foot his face turn livid with fear and he thrust into his breast the chart like paper which he have be originally study so say i this be how you repay the trust which we have repose in you you will leave my service to morrow 'he bow with the look of a man who be utterly crush and slink past me without a word the taper be still on the table and by it light i glance to see what the paper be which brunton have take from the bureau to my surprise it be nothing of any importance at all but simply a copy of the question and answer in the singular old observance call the musgrave ritual it be a sort of ceremony peculiar to our family which each musgrave for century past have go through on his come of age a thing of private interest and perhaps of some little importance to the archaeologist like our own blazon and charge but of no practical use whatever 'we have better come back to the paper afterwards say i 'if you think it really necessary he answer with some hesitation 'to continue my statement however i relocked the bureau use the key which brunton have leave and i have turn to go when i be surprise to find that the butler have return and be stand before me mr musgrave sir he cry in a voice which be hoarse with emotion i can't bear disgrace sir i've always be proud above my station in life and disgrace would kill me my blood will be on your head sir it will indeed if you drive

before all the folk that i know so well you don't deserve much consideration brunton i answer your conduct have be most infamous however a you have be a long time in the family i have no wish to bring public disgrace upon you a month however be too long take yourself away in a week and give what reason you like for go only a week sir he cry in a despair voice a fortnight say at least a fortnight a week i repeat and you may consider yourself to have be very leniently deal with 'he creep away his face sink upon his breast like a break man while i put out the light and return to my room 'for two

energy why should this servant be so anxious to master this old formula evidently because he saw something in it which have escape all those generation of country squire and from which he expect some personal advantage what be it then and how have it affect his fate it be perfectly obvious to me on read the ritual that the measurement must refer to some spot to which the rest of the document allude and that if we could find that spot we should be in a fair way towards find what the secret be which the old musgraves have think it necessary to embalm in so curious a fashion there be two guide give u to start with an oak and an elm a to the oak there could be no question at all right in front of the house upon the leave hand side of the drive there stand a patriarch among oak one of the most magnificent tree that i have ever see 'that be there when your ritual be draw up say i a we drive past it 'it be there at the norman conquest in all probability he answer 'it have a girth of twenty three foot 'have you any old elm i ask 'there use to be a very old one over yonder but it be strike by lightning ten year ago and we cut down the stump 'you can see where it use to be 'oh yes 'there be no other elm 'no old one but plenty of beech 'i should like to see where it grow we have drive up in a dog cart and my client lead me away at once without our enter the house to the scar on the lawn where the elm have stand it be nearly midway between the oak and the house my investigation seem to be progress 'i suppose it be impossible to find out how high the elm be i ask 'i can give you it at once it be sixty four foot 'how do you come to know it i ask in surprise 'when my old tutor use to give me an exercise in trigonometry it always take the shape of measure height when i be a lad i work out every tree and build in the estate this be an unexpected piece of luck my data be come more quickly than i could have reasonably hop 'tell me i ask 'did your butler ever ask you such a question reginald musgrave look at me in astonishment 'now that you call it to my mind he answer 'brunton _did_ ask me about the height of the tree some month ago in connection with some little argument with the groom this be excellent news watson for it show me that i be on the right road i look up at the sun it be low in the heaven and i calculate that in le than an hour it would lie just above the topmost branch of the old oak one condition mention in the ritual would then be fulfil and the shadow of the elm must mean the farther end of the shadow otherwise the trunk would have be choose a the guide i have then to find where the far end of the shadow would fall when the sun be just clear of the oak that must have be difficult holmes when the elm be no longer there well at least i know that if brunton could do it i could also besides there be no real difficulty i go with musgrave to his study and whittle myself this peg to which i tie this long string with a knot at each yard then i take two length of a fish rod which come to just six foot and i go back with my client to where the elm have be the sun be just graze the top of the oak i fasten the rod on end mark out the direction of the shadow and measure it it be nine foot in length of course the calculation now be a simple one if a rod of six foot throw a shadow of nine a tree of sixty four foot would throw one of ninety six and the line of the one would of course be the line of the other i measure out the distance which bring me almost to the wall of the house and i thrust a peg into the spot you can imagine my exultation watson when within two inch of my peg i saw a conical depression in the grind i know that it be the mark make by brunton in his measurement and that i be still upon his trail from this start point i proceed to step have first take the cardinal point by my pocket compass ten step with each foot take me along parallel with the wall of the house and again i mark my spot with a peg then i carefully pace off five to the east and two to the south it bring me to the very threshold of the old door two step to the west mean now that i be to go two pace down the stone flag passage and this be the place indicate by the ritual never have i felt such a cold chill of disappointment watson for a moment it seem to me that there must be some radical mistake in my calculation the set sun shine full upon the passage floor and i could see that the old foot wear grey stone with which it be pave be firmly cement together and have certainly not be move for many a long year brunton have not be at work here i tap upon the floor but it sound the same all over and there be no sign of any crack or crevice but fortunately musgrave who have begin to appreciate the mean of my proceed and who be now a excite a myself take out his manuscript to check my calculation 'and under he cry 'you have omit the and under i have think that it mean that we be to dig but now of course i saw at once that i be wrong 'there be a cellar under this then i cry 'yes and a old a the house down here through this door we go down a wind stone stair and my companion strike a match light a large lantern which stand on a barrel in the corner in an instant it be obvious that we have at last come upon the true place and that we have not be the only people to visit the spot recently it have be use for the storage of wood but the billet which have evidently be litter over the floor be now pile at the side so a to leave a clear space in the middle in this space lay a large and heavy flagstone with a rust iron ring in the centre to which a thick shepherd's check muffler be attach 'by jove cry my client that s brunton's muffler i have see it on him and could swear to it what have the villain be do here at my suggestion a couple of the county police be summon to be present and i then endeavour to raise the stone by pull on the cravat i could only move it slightly and it be with the aid of one of the constable that i succeed at last in carry it to one side a black hole yawn beneath into which we all peer while musgrave kneel at the side push down the lantern a small chamber about seven foot deep and four foot square lay open to u at one side of this be a squat brass bind wooden box the lid of which be hinge upwards with this curious old fashion key project from the lock it be then that i write and send the paper to you mr holmes it be not a thing that i could take to the police for they would have laugh at me but you will tell me what to do i be not a rich man but if there be any

turn towards me and his face seem to be rigid with expectation a he star out into the blackness of the moor for some minute he stand watch intently then he give a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light instantly i make my way back to my room and very shortly come the stealthy step pas once more upon their return journey long afterwards when i have fall into a light sleep i hear a key turn somewhere in a lock but i could not tell whence the sound come what it all mean i cannot guess but there be some secret business go on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of i do not trouble you with my theory for you ask me to furnish you only with fact i have have a long talk with sir henry this morning and we have make a plan of campaign found upon my observation of last night i will not speak about it just now but it should make my next report interest read baskerville hall oct 15th my dear holmes if i be compel to leave you without much news during the early day of my mission you must acknowledge that i be make up for lose time and that event be now crowd thick and fast upon u in my last report i end upon my top note with barrymore at the window and now i have quite a budget already which will unless i be much mistake considerably surprise you thing have take a turn which i could not have anticipate in some way they have within the last forty eight hour become much clearer and in some way they have become more complicate but i will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself before breakfast on the morning follow my adventure i go down the corridor and examine the room in which barrymore have be on the night before the western window through which he have star so intently have i notice one peculiarity above all other window in the house it command the nearest outlook on to the moor there be an open between two tree which enable one from this point of view to look right down upon it while from all the other window it be only a distant glimpse which can be obtain it follow therefore that barrymore since only this window would serve the purpose must have be look out for something or somebody upon the moor the night be very dark so that i can hardly imagine how he could have hop to see anyone it have strike me that it be possible that some love intrigue be on foot that would have account for his stealthy movement and also for the uneasiness of his wife the man be a strike look fellow very well equip to steal the heart of a country girl so that this theory seem to have something to support it that open of the door which i have hear after i have return to my room might mean that he have go out to keep some clandestine appointment so i reason with myself in the morning and i tell you the direction of my suspicion however much the result may have show that they be unfounded but whatever the true explanation of barrymore's movement might be i felt that the responsibility of keep them to myself until i could explain them be more than i could bear i have an interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast and i tell him all that i have see he be le surprise than i have expect i know that barrymore walk about night and i have a mind to speak to him about it say he two or three time i have hear his step in the passage come and go just about the hour you name perhaps then he pay a visit every night to that particular window i suggest perhaps he do if so we should be able to shadow him and see what it be that he be after i wonder what your friend holmes would do if he be here i believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest say i he would follow barrymore and see what he do then we shall do it together but surely he would hear u the man be rather deaf and in any case we must take our chance of that we'll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he pas sir henry rub his hand with pleasure and it be evident that he hail the adventure a a relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor the baronet have be in communication with the architect who prepare the plan for sir charles and with a contractor from london so that we may expect great change to begin here soon there have be decorator and furnishers up from plymouth and it be evident that our friend have large idea and mean to spare no pain or expense to restore the grandeur of his family when the house be renovate and refurnish all that he will need will be a wife to make it complete between ourselves there be pretty clear sign that this will not be want if the lady be will for i have seldom see a man more infatuate with a woman than he be with our beautiful neighbour miss stapleton and yet the course of true love do not run quite a smoothly a one would under the circumstance expect today for example it surface be break by a very unexpected ripple which have cause our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance after the conversation which i have quote about barrymore sir

with a bright kindly glance from one to the other of u she replace her pearl box in her bosom and hurry away stand at the window i watch her walk briskly down the street until the gray turban and white feather be but a speck in the sombre crowd what a very attractive woman i exclaim turn to my companion he have light his pipe again and be lean back with droop eyelid be she he say languidly i do not observe you really be an automaton a calculate machine i cry there be something positively inhuman in you at time he smile gently it be of the first importance he say not to allow your judgment to be bias by personal quality a client be to me a mere unit a factor in a problem the emotional quality be antagonistic to clear reason i assure you that the most win woman i ever know be hang for poison three little child for their insurance money and the most repellant man of my acquaintance be a philanthropist who have spend nearly a quarter of a million upon the london poor in this case however i never make exception an exception disprove the rule have you ever have occasion to study character in handwrite what do you make of this fellow's scribble it be legible and regular i answer a man of business habit and some force of character holmes shake his head look at his long letter he say they hardly rise above the common herd that d might be an a and that l an e men of character always differentiate their long letter however illegibly they may write there be vacillation in his k's and self esteem in his capital i be go out now i have some few reference to make let me recommend this book one of the most remarkable ever pen it be winwood reade's 'martyrdom of man i shall be back in an hour i sit in the window with the volume in my hand but my thought be far from the dare speculation of the writer my mind run upon our late visitor her smile the deep rich tone of her voice the strange mystery which overhang her life if she be seventeen at the time of her father's disappearance she must be seven and twenty now a sweet age when youth have lose it self consciousness and become a little sober by experience so i sit and muse until such dangerous thought come into my head that i hurry away to my desk and plunge furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology what be i an army surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker bank account that i should dare to think of such thing she be a unit a factor nothing more if my future be black it be better surely to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will o' the wisp of the imagination it be half past five before holmes return he be bright eager and in excellent spirit a mood which in his case alternate with fit of the blackest depression there be no great mystery in this matter he say take the cup of tea which i have pour out for him the fact appear to admit of only one explanation what you have solve it already well that would be too much to say i have discover a suggestive fact that be all it be however very suggestive the detail be still to be add i have just find on consult the back file of the time that major sholto of upper norword late of the 34th bombay infantry die upon the 28th of april i may be very obtuse holmes but i fail to see what this suggest no you surprise me look at it in this way then captain morstan disappear the only person in london whom he could have visit be major sholto major sholto deny have hear that he be in london four year later sholto die within a week of his death captain morstan's daughter receive a valuable present which be repeat from year to year and now culminate in a letter which describe her a a wrong woman what wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her father and why should the present begin immediately after sholto's death unless it be that sholto's heir know something of the mystery and desire to make compensation have you any alternative theory which will meet the fact but what a strange compensation and how strangely make why too should he write a letter now rather than six year ago again the letter speak of give her justice what justice can she have it be too much to suppose that her father be still alive there be no other injustice in her case that you know of there be difficulty there be certainly difficulty say sherlock holmes pensively but our expedition of to night will solve them all ah here be a four wheeler and miss morstan be inside be you all ready then we have better go down for it be a little past the hour i pick up my hat and my heaviest stick but i observe that holmes take his revolver from his drawer and slip it into his pocket it be clear that he think that our night's work might be a serious one miss morstan be muffle in a dark cloak and her sensitive face be compose but pale she must have be more than woman if she do not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we be embark yet her self control be perfect and she readily answer the few additional question which sherlock holmes put to her major sholto be a very particular friend of papa's she say his letter be full of allusion to the major he and papa be in command of the troop at the andaman island so they be throw a great deal together by the way a curious paper be find in papa's desk which no one could understand i don't suppose that it be of the slightest importance but i think you

case in which i have during the last eight year study the method of my friend sherlock holmes i find many tragic some comic a large number merely strange but none commonplace for work a he do rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth he refuse to associate himself with any investigation which do not tend towards the unusual and even the fantastic of all these vary case however i cannot recall any which present more singular feature than that which be associate with the well know surrey family of the roylotts of stoke moran the event in question occur in the early day of my association with holmes when we be share room a bachelor in baker street it be possible that i might have place them upon record before but a promise of secrecy be make at the time from which i have only be free during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge be give it be perhaps a well that the fact should now come to light for i have reason to know that there be widespread rumour a to the death of dr grimesby roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth it be early in april in the year that i wake one morning to find sherlock holmes stand fully dress by the side of my bed he be a late riser a a rule and a the clock on the mantelpiece show me that it be only a quarter past seven i blink up at him in some surprise and perhaps just a little resentment for i be myself regular in my habit very sorry to knock you up watson say he but it's the common lot this morning mr hudson have be knock up she retort upon me and

wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning and knock sleepy people up out of their bed i presume that it be something very press which they have to communicate should it prove to be an

be all in his favour and i know nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which run in his family that his advance should be reject so brusquely without any reference to the lady's own wish and that the lady should accept the situation without protest be very amaze however our conjecture be set at rest by a visit from stapleton himself that very afternoon he have come to offer apology for his rudeness of the morning and after a long private interview with sir henry in his study the upshot of their conversation be that the breach be quite heal and that we be to dine at merripit house next friday a a sign of it i don't say now that he isn't a crazy man say sir henry i can't forget the look in his eye when he run at me this morning but i must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he have do do he give any explanation of his conduct his sister be everything in his life he say that be natural enough and i be glad that he should understand her value they have always be together and accord to his account he have be a very lonely man with only her a a companion so that the think of lose her be really terrible to him he have not understand he say that i be become attach to her but when he saw with his own eye that it be really so and that she might be take away from him it give him such a shock that for a time he be not responsible for what he say or do he be very sorry for all that have pas and he recognize how foolish and how selfish it be that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life if she have to leave him he have rather it be to a neighbour like myself than to anyone else but in any case it be a blow to him and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself to meet it he would withdraw all opposition upon his part if i would promise for three month to let the matter rest and to be content with cultivate the lady's friendship during that time without claim her love this i promise and so the matter rest so there be one of our small mystery clear up it be something to have touch bottom anywhere in this bog in which we be flounder we know now why stapleton

excuse my trouble you about such a trifle i think it's well worth trouble about why you look very serious over it how do you explain it i just don't attempt to explain it it seem the very maddest queerest thing that ever happen to me the queerest perhaps say holmes thoughtfully what do you make of it yourself well i don't profess to understand it yet this case of yours be very complex sir henry when take in conjunction with your uncle's death i be not sure that of all the five hundred case of capital importance which i have handle there be one which cut so deep but we hold several thread in our hand and the odds be that one or other of them guide u to the truth we may waste time in follow the wrong one but sooner or later we must come upon the right we have a pleasant luncheon in which little be say of the business which have bring u together it be in the private sit room to which we afterwards repair that holmes ask baskerville what be his intention to go to baskerville hall and when at the end of the week on the whole say holmes i think that your decision be a wise one i have ample evidence that you be be dog in london and amid the million of this great city it be difficult to discover who these people be or what their object can be if their intention be evil they might do you a mischief and we should be powerless to prevent it you do not know dr mortimer that you be follow this morning from my house dr mortimer start violently follow by whom that unfortunately be what i cannot tell you have you among your neighbour or acquaintance on dartmoor any man with a black full beard no or let me see why yes barrymore sir charles's butler be a man with a full black beard ha where be barrymore he be in charge of the hall we have best ascertain if he be really there or if by any possibility he might be in london how can you do that give me a telegraph form 'is all ready for sir henry that will do address to mr barrymore baskerville hall what be the nearest

son of the old caretaker who be dead they have look after the hall for four generation now so far a i know he and his wife be a respectable a couple a any in the county at the same time say baskerville it's clear enough that so long a there be none of the family at the hall these people have a mighty fine home and nothing to do that be true do barrymore profit at all by sir charles's will ask holmes he and his wife have five hundred pound each ha do they know that they would receive this yes sir charles be very fond of talk about the provision of his will that be very interest i hope say dr mortimer that you do not look with suspicious eye upon everyone who receive a legacy from sir charles for i also have a thousand pound leave to me indeed and anyone else there be many insignificant sum to individual and a large number of public charity the residue all go to sir henry and how much be the residue seven hundred and forty thousand pound holmes raise his eyebrow in

of the estate be close on to a million dear me it be a stake for which a man might well play a desperate game and one more question dr mortimer suppose that anything happen to our young friend here you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis who would inherit the estate since rodger baskerville sir charles's younger brother die unmarried the estate would descend to the desmonds who be distant cousin jam desmond be an elderly clergyman in westmoreland thank you these detail be all of great interest have you meet mr jam desmond yes he once come down to visit sir charles he be a man of

that it can be of little help to you in solve this mystery 'at least say i 'it give u another mystery and one which be even more interest than the first it may be that the solution of the one may prove to be the solution of the other you will excuse me musgrave if i say that your butler appear to me to have be a very clever man and to have have a clearer insight than ten generation of his master 'i hardly follow you say musgrave 'the paper seem to me to be of no practical importance 'but to me it seem immensely practical and i fancy that brunton take the same view he have probably see it before that night on which you catch him 'it be very possible we take no pain to hide it 'he simply wish i should imagine to refresh his memory upon that last occasion he have a i understand some

should ever communicate to the public this resolution of mine be not due to any lack of material since i have note of many hundred of case to which i have never allude nor be it cause by any wan interest on the part of my reader in the singular personality and unique method of this remarkable man the real reason lay in the reluctance which mr holmes have show to the continue publication of

and bee farm on the sussex down notoriety have become hateful to him and he have peremptorily request that his wish in this matter should be strictly observe it be only upon my represent to him that i

the document in question be of such immense importance that it publication might very easily i might almost say probably lead to european complication of the utmost moment it be not too much to say that peace or war may hang upon the issue unless it recovery can be attend with the utmost secrecy then it may a well not be recover at all for all that be aim at by those who have take it be that it

crisis the strange chain of event which for some day make ridling thorpe manor a household word through the length and breadth of england we have hardly alight at north walsham and mention the name of our destination when the station master hurry towards u i suppose that you be the detective from london say he a look of annoyance pas over holmes's face what make you think such a thing because inspector martin from norwich have just pas through but maybe you be the surgeon she's not dead or wasn't by last account you may be in time to save her yet though it be for the gallows holmes's brow be dark with anxiety we be go to ridling thorpe manor say he but we have hear nothing of what have pas there it's a terrible business say the station master they be shoot both mr hilton cubitt and his wife she shoot him and then herself so the servant say he's dead and her life be despair of dear dear one of the oldest family in the county of norfolk and one of the most honour without a word holmes hurry to a carriage and during the long seven miles' drive he never open his mouth seldom have i see him so utterly despondent he have be uneasy during all our journey from town and i have observe that he have turn over the morning paper with anxious attention but now this sudden realization of his worst fear leave him in a blank melancholy he lean back in his seat lose in gloomy speculation yet there be much around to interest u for we be pas through a singular a country side a any in england where a few scatter cottage represent the population of to day while on every hand enormous square tower church bristle up from the flat green landscape and tell of the glory and prosperity of old east anglia at last the violet rim of the german ocean appear over the green edge of the norfolk coast and the driver point with his whip to two old brick and timber gable which project from a grove of tree that's ridling thorpe manor say he a we drive up to the porticoed front door i observe in front of it beside the tennis lawn the black tool house and the pedestalled sun dial with which we have such strange association a dapper little man with a quick alert manner and a wax moustache have just descend from a high dog cart he introduce himself a inspector martin of the norfolk constabulary and he be considerably astonish when he hear the name of my companion why mr holmes the crime be only commit at three this morning how could you hear of it in london and get to the spot a soon a i i anticipate it i come in the hope of prevent it then you must have important evidence of which we be ignorant for they be say to be a most unite couple i have only the evidence of the dance men say holmes i will explain the matter to you later meanwhile since it be too late to prevent this tragedy i be very anxious that i should use the knowledge which i posse in order to ensure that justice be do will you associate me in your investigation or will you prefer that i should act independently i should be proud to feel that we"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "he be a fine creature this man of the old english soil simple straight and gentle with his great earnest blue eye and broad comely face his love for his wife and his trust in her shine in his feature holmes have listen to his story with the utmost attention and now he sit for some time in silent think don't you think mr cubitt say he at last that your best plan would be to make a direct appeal to your wife and to ask her to share her secret with you hilton cubitt shake his massive head a promise be a promise mr holmes if elsie wish to tell me she would if not it be not for me to force her confidence but i be justify in take my own line and i will then i will help you with all my heart in the first place have you hear of any stranger be see in your neighbourhood no i presume that it be a very quiet place any fresh face would cause comment in the immediate neighbourhood yes but we have several small water place not very far away and the farmer take in lodger these hieroglyphic have evidently a mean if it be a purely arbitrary one it may be impossible for u to solve it if on the other hand it be systematic i have no doubt that we shall get to the bottom of it but this particular sample be so short that i can do nothing and the fact which you have bring me be so indefinite that we have no basis for an investigation i would suggest that you return to norfolk that you keep a keen look out and that you take an exact copy of any fresh dance men which may appear it be a thousand pity that we have not a reproduction of those which be do in chalk upon the window sill make a discreet inquiry also a to any stranger in the neighbourhood when you have collect some fresh evidence come to me again that be the best advice which i can give you mr hilton cubitt if there be any press fresh development i shall be always ready to run down and see you in your norfolk home the interview leave sherlock holmes very thoughtful and several time in the next few day i saw him take his slip of paper from his note book and look long and earnestly at the curious figure inscribe upon it he make no allusion to the affair however until one afternoon a fortnight or so later i be go out when he call me back you have better stay here watson why because i have a wire from hilton cubitt this morning you remember hilton cubitt of the dance men he be to reach liverpool street at one twenty he may be here at any moment i gather from his wire that there have be some new incident of importance we have not long to wait for our norfolk squire come straight from the station a fast a a hansom could bring him he be look worry and depress with tire eye and a line forehead it's get on my nerve this business mr holmes say he a he sink like a weary man into an arm chair it's bad enough to feel that you be surround by unseen unknown folk who have some kind of design upon you but when in addition to that you know that it be just kill your wife by inch then it become a much a flesh and blood can endure she's wear away under it just wear away before my eye have she say anything yet no mr holmes she have not and yet there have be time when the poor girl have want to speak and yet could not quite bring herself to take the plunge i have try to help her but i dare say i do it clumsily and scar her off from it she have speak about my old family and our reputation in the county and our pride in our unsullied honour and i always felt it be lead to the point but somehow it turn off before we get there but you have find out something for yourself a good deal mr holmes i have several fresh dance men picture for you to examine and what be more important i have see the fellow what the man who draw them yes i saw him at his work but i will tell you everything in order when i get back after my visit to you the very first thing i saw next morning be a fresh crop of dance men they have be draw in chalk upon the black wooden door of the tool house which stand beside the lawn in full view of the front window i take an exact copy and here it be he unfold a paper and lay it upon the table here be a copy of the hieroglyphic graphic excellent say holmes excellent pray continue when i have take the copy i rub out the mark but two morning later a fresh inscription have appear i have a copy of it here graphic holmes rub his hand and chuckle with delight our material be rapidly accumulate say he three day later a message be leave scrawl upon paper and place under a pebble upon the sun dial here it be the character be a you see exactly the same a the last one after that i determine to lie in wait so i get out my revolver and i sit up in my study which overlook the lawn and garden about two in the morning i be seat by the window all be dark save for the moonlight outside when i hear step behind me and there be my wife in her dress gown she implore me to come to bed i tell her frankly that i wish to see who it be who play such absurd trick upon u she answer that it be some senseless practical joke and that i should not take any notice of it 'if it really annoy you hilton we might go and travel you and i and so avoid this nuisance 'what be drive out of our own house by a practical joker say i 'why we should have the whole county laugh at u 'well come to bed say she 'and we can discus it in the morning suddenly a she speak i saw her white face grow whiter yet in the moonlight and her hand tighten upon my shoulder something be move in the shadow of the tool house i saw a dark creep figure which crawl round the corner and squat in front of the door seize my pistol i be rush out when my wife throw her arm round me and hold me with convulsive strength i try to throw her off but she cling to me most desperately at last i get clear but by the time i have open the door and reach the house the creature be go he have leave a trace of his presence however for there on the door be the very same arrangement of dance men which have already twice appear and which i have copy on that paper there be no other sign of the fellow anywhere though i run all over the ground and yet the amaze thing be that he must have be there all the time for when i examine the door again in the morning he have scrawl some more of his picture under the line which i have already see have you that fresh draw yes it be very short but i make a copy of it and here it be again he produce a paper the new dance be in this form graphic tell me say holmes and i could see by his eye that he be much excite be this a mere addition to the first or do it appear to be entirely separate it be on a different panel of the door excellent this be far the most important of all for our purpose it fill me with hop now mr hilton cubitt please continue your most interest statement i have nothing more to"}, {"label": "doyle", "text": "that depend on whether you be go on the moor say i yes i be well you know what my instruction be i be sorry to intrude but you hear how earnestly holmes insist that i should not leave you and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor sir henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile my dear fellow say he holmes with all his wisdom do not foresee some thing which have happen since i have be on the moor you understand me i be sure that you be the last man in the world who would wish to be a spoil sport i must go out alone it put me in a most awkward position i be at a loss what to say or what to do and before i have make up my mind he pick up his cane and be go but when i come to think the matter over my conscience reproach me bitterly for have on any pretext allow him to go out of my sight i imagine what my feel would be if i have to return to you and to confess that some misfortune have occur through my disregard for your instruction i assure you my cheek flush at the very think it might not even now be too late to overtake him so i set off at once in the direction of merripit house i hurry along the road at the top of my speed without see anything of sir henry until i come to the point where the moor path branch off there fear that perhaps i have come in the wrong direction after all i mount a hill from which i could command a view the same hill which be cut into the dark quarry thence i saw him at once he be on the moor path about a quarter of a mile off and a lady be by his side who could only be miss stapleton it be clear that there be already an understand between them and that they have meet by appointment they be walk slowly along in deep conversation and i saw her make quick little movement of her hand a if she be very earnest in what she be say while he listen intently and once or twice shake his head in strong dissent i stand among the rock watch them very much puzzle a to what i should do next to follow them and break into their intimate conversation seem to be an outrage and yet my clear duty be never for an instant to let him out of my sight to act the spy upon a friend be a hateful task still i could see no better course than to observe him from the hill and to clear my conscience by confess to him afterwards what i have do it be true that if any sudden danger have threaten him i be too far away to be of use and yet i be sure that you will agree with me that the position be very difficult and that there be nothing more which i could do our friend sir henry and the lady have halt on the path and be stand deeply absorb in their conversation when i be suddenly aware that i be not the only witness of their interview a wisp of green float in the air catch my eye and another glance show me that it be carry on a stick by a man who be move among the break grind it be stapleton with his butterfly net he be very much closer to the pair than i be and he appear to be move in their direction at this instant sir henry suddenly draw miss stapleton to his side his arm be round her but it seem to me that she be strain away from him with her face avert he stoop his head to hers and she raise one hand a if in protest next moment i saw them spring apart and turn hurriedly round stapleton be the cause of the interruption he be run wildly towards them his absurd net dangle behind him he gesticulate and almost dance with excitement in front of the lover what the scene mean i could not imagine but it seem to me that stapleton be abuse sir henry who offer explanation which become more angry a the other refuse to accept them the lady stand by in haughty silence finally stapleton turn upon his heel and beckon in a peremptory way to his sister who after an irresolute glance at sir henry walk off by the side of her brother the naturalist's angry gesture show that the lady be include in his displeasure the baronet stand for a minute look after them and then he walk slowly back the way that he have come his head hang the very picture of dejection what all this mean i could not imagine but i be deeply ashamed to have witness so intimate a scene without my friend's knowledge i run down the hill therefore and meet the baronet at the bottom his face be flush with anger and his brow be wrinkle like one who be at his wit's end what to do halloa watson where have you drop from say he you don't mean to say that you come after me in spite of all i explain everything to him how i have find it impossible to remain behind how i have follow him and how i have witness all that have occur for an instant his eye blaze at me but my frankness disarm his anger and he break at last into a rather rueful laugh you would have think the middle of that prairie a fairly safe place for a man to be private say he but by thunder the whole countryside seem to have be out to see me do my woo and a mighty poor woo at that where have you engage a seat i be on that hill quite in the back row eh but her brother be well up to the front do you see him come out on u yes i do do he ever strike you a be crazy this brother of hers i can't say that he ever do i dare say not i always think him sane enough until today but you can take it from me that either he or i ought to be in a straitjacket what's the matter with me anyhow you've live near me for some week watson tell me straight now be there anything that would prevent me from make a good husband to a woman

and she too she be happy when she be with me and that i'll swear there's a light in a woman's eye that speak louder than word but he have never let u get together and it be only today for the first time that i saw a chance of have a few word with her alone she be glad to meet me but when she do it be not love that she would talk about and she wouldn't have let me talk about it either if she could have stop it she keep come back to it that this be a place of danger and that she would never be happy until i have leave it i tell her that since i have see her i be in no hurry to leave it and that if she really want me to go the only way to work it be for her to arrange to go with me with that i offer in a many word to marry her but before she could answer down come this brother of hers
