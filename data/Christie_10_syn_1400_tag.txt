on the tip of her <tongue|knife> remain unspoken for the man's appearance and manner do not bear out her <first|low> and most natural assumption she hesitate a if he <read|say> her thought the man say quickly i can assure you <i|single> mean no disrespect tuppence believe him although she dislike and distrust him instinctively she be incline to acquit him of the particular motive which she <have|let> at first attribute to him she <look|see> him up and down he be a big <man|mankind> clean shave with a heavy jowl his eye be small and cunning and shift their glance under her direct gaze well what be it she ask the <man|gentleman> smile i happen to overhear part of your conversation with the young gentleman in lyons' <well|easily> what of it nothing except that i think i may be of some <use|exercise> to you another inference force itself into tuppence's mind you follow me here i take that liberty and in what <way|agency> do you think you could <be|follow> of <use|purpose> to me the man take a card from his pocket and hand it to her with a bow tuppence take it and scrutinize it carefully it bore the inscription mr edward whittington below the name be the word esthonia glassware co and the address of a city office mr whittington speak again if you will call upon me to morrow <morning|aurora> at eleven o'clock i <will|leave> lay the detail of my proposition before you at eleven o'clock say tuppence doubtfully at eleven o'clock <tuppence|twopence> make up her mind very well i'll be there thank you <good|full> even he raise his hat with a flourish and walk <away|aside> <tuppence|twopence> remain for some minute gaze after him then she give a curious <movement|effort> of her shoulder rather a a terrier <shake|rock> himself the adventure have begin she murmur to herself what do he want me to do i wonder there's something about you mr whittington that i don't like at all but on the other <hand|reach> i'm not the least bite afraid of you and a i've say before and shall doubtless say again little tuppence can <look|expect> after herself thank you and with a short sharp nod of her head she walk briskly onward a a result of further meditation however she turn aside from the direct route and enter a post office there she ponder for some moment a telegraph form in her hand the <think|recall> of a possible five shill spend unnecessarily spur i should suggest that we call upon him there a soon a possible shall we say after a bath and breakfast it be arrange that tuppence and julius should return to the _ritz_ and call for sir jam in the car this programme be faithfully <carry|run> out and a little after eleven they draw up before the _metropole_ they ask for dr hall and a page boy go in search of him in a few minute the little <doctor|restore> come hurry towards them can you spare u a few minute dr hall say sir jam pleasantly let me introduce you to miss cowley mr hersheimmer i think you already know a quizzical gleam come into the doctor's eye a he <shake|tremble> <hand|deal> with julius ah yes my young friend of the tree episode ankle all right eh i guess it's cure owe to your skilful treatment doc and the heart trouble ha ha still search say julius briefly to come to the point can we have a word with you in private ask sir jam certainly i think there be a room here where we shall be quite undisturbed he lead the way and the others follow him they sit down and the <doctor|medico> look inquiringly at sir <jam|hole> dr hall i be very anxious to find a certain young lady for the <purpose|function> of obtain a statement from her i have reason to believe that she have be at one time or another in your establishment at bournemouth i hope i be transgress no professional etiquette in question you on the subject i suppose it be a matter of testimony sir jam hesitate a moment then he reply yes i shall be please to give you any information in my power what be the young lady's name mr hersheimmer ask me i remember he half turn to julius the name say sir jam bluntly be really immaterial she would be <almost|nearly> certainly send to you under an assume one but i should like to know if you <be|follow> acquaint with a mr vandemeyer mr vandemeyer of south audley mansion i know her slightly you be not aware of what have happen what do you mean you do not know that mr vandemeyer <be|follow> dead dear <dear|earnest> i have no idea of it when do it happen she take an overdose of chloral last night purposely accidentally it be believe i should not like to say myself anyway she <be|follow> find dead this morning very sad a singularly handsome woman i presume she be a friend of yours since you be acquaint with all these detail i be acquaint with the detail because well it be i who find her dead indeed say the doctor start yes say sir jam and stroke his chin reflectively this <be|follow> very sad news but you <will|leave> <excuse|apologize> me if i say that i do not <see|ensure> how it <bear|expect> on the subject of your inquiry it bear on it in this way be it not a fact that mr vandemeyer commit a young relative of hers to your charge julius lean forward eagerly that be the <case|cause> say the doctor quietly under the <name|figure> of janet vandemeyer i understand her to be a niece of mr vandemeyer's and she come to you a far a i can remember in june or july of be she a mental case she be perfectly sane if that be what you mean i understand from mr vandemeyer that the girl have be with her on the _lusitania_ when that ill fat ship be sink and have suffer a severe shock in consequence we're on the <right|good> track i think sir jam look <round|around> a i say before i'm a mutt return julius the doctor <look|spirit> at them all curiously you speak of want a statement from her he say suppose she be not able to give one what you have just say that she be perfectly sane so she be nevertheless if you want a statement from her concern any event prior to may she will not be able to give it to you they look at the little <man|valet> <stupefy|beat> he nod cheerfully it's a <pity|shame> he say a great pity especially a i gather sir <jam|hole> that the matter be <important|significant> but there it <be|follow> she can tell you <nothing|cipher> but why <man|gentleman> darn it all why the little man shift his benevolent <glance|glint> to the excite young american because janet vandemeyer be <suffer|have> from a complete loss of memory what <quite|rather> so an interest case a _very_ interest case not so uncommon really a you would think there <be|follow> several very well know parallel it's the first case of the kind that i've have under my own personal observation and i must admit that i've <find|see> it of absorb interest there <be|follow> something rather ghoulish in the little man's <satisfaction|atonement> and she remember nothing say sir jam slowly nothing prior to may after that date her memory be a good a yours or mine then the first thing she remember be land with the survivor everything before that be a blank she do not know her own name or where she have come from or where she <be|follow> she couldn't even speak her own tongue but surely all this be most unusual put in julius no my <dear|dearest> sir quite normal under the circumstance severe shock to the nervous system loss of memory proceed nearly <always|invariably> <on|along> the same line i suggest a specialist of course there's a very good man in paris make a study of these case but mr vandemeyer oppose the idea of publicity that might result from such a course i can imagine she would say sir <jam|pile> grimly i fell in with her view there be a certain notoriety give to these case and the girl be very young nineteen i believe it seem a pity that her <infirmity|feebleness> should be talk about might damage her prospect besides there be no <special|extra> treatment to <pursue|follow> in such case it be really a matter of wait wait yes sooner or later the memory will return a suddenly a it go but in all probability the girl will have entirely forget the intervene period and <will|leave> take up life where she leave off at the sink of the _lusitania_ and when do you expect this to happen the <doctor|repair> shrug his shoulder ah that i cannot say sometimes it be a matter of month sometimes it have be know to be a long a twenty year sometimes another shock do the <trick|deception> one restore what the other take away another shock eh say julius thoughtfully exactly there be a <case|instance> in colorado the little man's voice trail on voluble <mildly|gently> enthusiastic julius do not seem to be listen he <have|get> relapse into his own thought and be frown suddenly he come out of his brown study and hit the <table|postpone> such a resound bang with his fist that every one jump the doctor most of all i've <get|make> it i guess doc i'd like your medical opinion on the plan i'm about to outline say jane be to cross the herring pond again and the same thing be to happen the submarine the sink ship every one to take to the boat and so on wouldn't that do the trick wouldn't it give a mighty big bump to her subconscious self or whatever the jargon be and start it function again right away a very <interest|stake> speculation mr hersheimmer in my own opinion it would <be|follow> successful it be unfortunate that there be no chance of the condition repeat themselves a you suggest not by nature perhaps doc but i'm talk about art art why yes what's the difficulty hire a <liner|ocean_liner> a liner murmur dr hall faintly hire some passenger hire a submarine that's the <only|solitary> difficulty i guess government be <apt|given> to be a bite hide <bind|oblige> over their engine of war they won't sell to the <first|low> comer still i guess that can be get over ever hear of the word 'graft sir well graft <get|have> there every time i reckon that we shan't really need to fire a torpedo if every one hustle round and scream loud enough that the ship <be|follow> sink it ought to be enough for an innocent young girl like jane by the time she's get a life <belt|knock> <on|along> her and be be hustle into a boat with a well <drill|practice> <lot|fate> of artiste <do|come> the hysterical stunt on deck why she ought to be right back where she be in may how's that for the bare outline dr <hall|mansion> look at julius everything that he be for the <moment|instant> incapable of <say|tell> be eloquent in that look no say julius in answer to it i'm not crazy the thing's perfectly possible it's <do|come> every day in the state for the movie haven't you see train in collision on the screen what's the difference between buy up a train and buy up a liner get the property and you can go <right|good> ahead dr hall find his <voice|representative> but the expense my dear sir his voice rise the expense it <will|leave> be _colossal money doesn't worry me any explain julius simply dr hall turn an appeal face to sir jam who smile slightly mr hersheimmer be very well off <very|really> well off indeed the doctor's glance come back to julius with a new and subtle quality in it this be no longer an eccentric young <fellow|lad> with a habit of fall off tree the doctor's eye hold the <deference|respect> accord to a really rich man very remarkable <plan|contrive> very remarkable he murmur the movie of <course|form> your american word for the kinema very interest i fear we be perhaps a little behind the time over here in our method and you <really|actually> mean to carry out this <remarkable|noteworthy> plan of yours you bet your bottom dollar i do the doctor believe him which <be|follow> a tribute to his nationality if an englishman have suggest such a thing he would have <have|take> grave doubt a to his sanity i cannot guarantee a cure he point out perhaps i ought to <make|realize> that quite <clear|open> sure that's all right say julius you just trot out jane and <leave|will> the rest to me jane miss janet vandemeyer then can we get on the long distance to your place right away and ask them to send her <up|astir> or shall i run down and fetch her in my <car|machine> the <doctor|medico> <star|principal> i beg your pardon mr hersheimmer i think you understand understand what that miss vandemeyer be no longer under my care julius spring up what i think you be aware of that when do she leave let me see to day be monday <be|follow> it not it must have <be|follow> last wednesday why surely yes it be the same even that you er fell out of my tree that even before or after let me see oh yes afterwards a very urgent message arrive from mr vandemeyer the young lady and the <nurse|suck> who <be|follow> in charge of her leave by the night train julius sink back again into his chair nurse edith leave with a patient i remember he mutter my god to have be so near dr hall look bewilder i don't understand be the young lady not with her aunt after all tuppence shake her head she be about to speak when a warn glance from sir jam make her hold her tongue the lawyer rise i'm much oblige to you hall we're very grateful for all you've tell u i'm afraid we're now in the position of have to track miss vandemeyer anew what about the nurse who <accompany|follow> her i suppose you don't know where she be the <doctor|fix> shake his head we've not hear from her a it happen i understand she be to remain with miss vandemeyer for a while but what can have happen <surely|certainly> the girl have not <be|follow> kidnap that remain to be see say sir jam gravely the other hesitate you do not think i ought to go to the <police|law> no no in all probability the young lady be with other relation the <doctor|physician> be not completely satisfy but he saw that sir jam be determine to say no more and realize that to try and extract more information from the famous k c would be mere <waste|emaciate> of labour accordingly he wish them goodbye and they leave the hotel for a few minute they stand by the car talk how madden cry tuppence to think that julius must have be actually under the same <roof|cap> with her for a few hour i be a darn idiot mutter julius gloomily you couldn't know tuppence console him could he she appeal to sir <jam|wad> i should advise you not to worry say the latter kindly no use cry over spill milk you know the great thing be what to do next add tuppence the practical sir jam shrug his shoulder you might advertise for the nurse who accompany the <girl|miss> that <be|follow> the only course i can suggest and i must

upon for a full and complete <explanation|account> you've be too darn close about the whole business julius accuse him you let on to me that you be off to the argentine though i guess you have your reason for that the idea of both you and tuppence cast me for the <part|character> of mr brown just tickle me to death the idea be not original to them say mr carter gravely it be suggest and the poison <very|really> carefully instill by a past master in the art the paragraph in the new york paper suggest the <plan|design> to him and by mean of it he weave a <web|net> that nearly enmesh you fatally i never like him say julius i felt from the first that there be something wrong about him and i <always|invariably> suspect that it be he who silence mr vandemeyer so appositely but it wasn't till i <hear|see> that the order for tommy's execution come right on the heel of our interview with him that sunday that i begin to tumble to the fact that he be the big bug himself i never suspect it at all lament tuppence i've always think i be so much cleverer than tommy but he's undoubtedly <score|make> over me handsomely julius agree tommy's be the good this trip and instead of sit there a dumb a a fish let him banish his blush and tell u all about it hear hear there's nothing to tell say tommy acutely uncomfortable i be an awful mug right up to the time i find that <photograph|snap> of annette and realize that she be jane finn then i remember how persistently she <have|give> shout out that <word|phrase> <marguerite|white_daisy> and i think of the picture and <well|intimately> that's that then of <course|path> i go over the whole thing to see where i'd <make|take> an as of myself go on say mr carter a tommy show sign of take refuge in silence once more that <business|job> about mr vandemeyer have worry me when julius tell me about it on the face of it it seem that he or sir jam must have do the <trick|john> but i didn't know which find that photograph in the drawer after that story of how it have be get from him by inspector brown make me suspect julius then i remember that it be sir jam who have <discover|see> the false jane finn in the end i couldn't make up my <mind|intellect> and <just|exactly> <decide|settle> to <take|assume> no chance either way i leave a note for julius in case he be mr brown say i be off to the argentine and i drop sir james's letter with the offer of the job by the desk so that he would <see|find> it be a genuine stunt <then|so> i <write|save> my letter to mr carter and ring up sir <jam|wad> take him into my confidence would be the best thing either way so i tell him everything except where i believe the paper to be hide the way he help me to get on the track of tuppence and annette almost disarm me but not quite i keep my mind <open|clear> between the two of them and then i get a bogus note from tuppence and i know but how tommy <take|make> the note in question from his pocket and pas it round the table it's her handwrite all right but i know it wasn't from her because of the signature she'd never spell her name 'twopence but anyone who'd never see it write might quite easily do so julius _had_ see it he show me a <note|billet> of hers to him once but _sir jam hadn't after that everything be <plain|manifest> sail i send off albert post haste to mr carter i pretend to go away but double back again when julius come <burst|split> up in his car i felt it wasn't part of mr brown's plan and that there would probably be trouble unless sir jam be actually catch in the act so to speak i know mr carter would never believe it of him on my bare word i didn't interpose mr carter ruefully that's why i send the <girl|daughter> off to sir jam i be sure they'd <fetch|get> up at the <house|family> in soho sooner or later i threaten julius with the revolver because i want tuppence to repeat that to sir jam so that he wouldn't worry about u the <moment|bit> the <girl|fille> be out of sight i tell julius to drive like hell for london and a we go along i tell him the whole story we get to the <soho|Soho> house in plenty of <time|clock> and meet mr carter outside after arrange thing with him we go in and hide behind the curtain in the recess the policeman have order to say if they be ask that no one have go into the house that's all and tommy come to an abrupt halt there be silence for a moment by the way say julius <suddenly|abruptly> you're all wrong <about|around> that photograph of jane it _was_ take from me but <i|single> find it again where cry tuppence in that little safe on the <wall|surround> in mr vandemeyer's bedroom i know you find something say tuppence reproachfully to tell you the truth that's what start me off suspect you why didn't you say i <guess|conjecture> i be a mite suspicious <too|excessively> it have be get away from me once and i determine i wouldn't let on i'd <get|take> it until a photographer have make a dozen copy of it we all keep back something or other say <tuppence|twopence> thoughtfully i <suppose|theorize> secret service work make you like that in the pause that ensue mr carter take from his pocket a small shabby brown book beresford have just say that i would not have believe sir jam peel edgerton to be guilty unless so to speak he be catch in the <act|move> that be so <indeed|so> not until i read the entry in this <little|small> <book|reserve> could i bring myself fully to credit the amaze truth this book will pas into the possession of scotland yard but it will never be publicly exhibit sir james's <long|tenacious> <association|tie> with the law would make it undesirable but to you who know the truth i propose to read certain passage which will <throw|give> some light on the extraordinary mentality of this great man he open the book and turn the thin page it be madness to keep this book i know that it be documentary evidence against me but i <have|let> never shrink from take <risk|danger> and i feel an urgent <need|require> for self expression the book will only be <take|consider> from my dead body from an early age i realize that i have exceptional ability only a fool underestimate his capability my brain power be greatly above the average i know that i be bear to <succeed|follow> my <appearance|show> be the only <thing|matter> against me i be quiet and insignificant utterly nondescript when i be a boy i hear a <famous|notable> murder <trial|test> i be deeply impress by the power and eloquence of the counsel for the defence for the first <time|clock> i entertain the idea of <take|make> my talent to that particular market then i study the criminal in the dock the man be a fool he have be <incredibly|improbably> <unbelievably|improbably> stupid even the eloquence of his <counsel|advocate> be hardly likely to save him i felt an immeasurable contempt for him <then|so> it <occur|come> to me that the criminal <standard|criterion> be a low one it be the wastrel the <failure|loser> the general <riff|thumb> raff of civilization who drift into crime strange that men of brain have never realize it extraordinary opportunity i <play|run> with the idea what a magnificent field what unlimited possibility it make my brain <reel|spool> i read standard work on crime and criminal they all confirm my opinion degeneracy disease never the deliberate embrace of a career by a far <see|interpret>

of england what then <be|follow> that power hamper at every turn by my colleague fetter by the democratic system of which i should be the mere figurehead no the power i dream of be absolute an autocrat a <dictator|potentate> and such power could only be obtain by work outside the law to play on the weakness of human nature then on the weakness of nation to get together and control a vast organization and finally to overthrow the <exist|live> order and <rule|find> the think intoxicate me i saw that i must lead two live a <man|gentleman> like myself be bind to attract notice i must have

forget that it <be|follow> not the english custom une poignee de main alors i felt rather at a loose <end|stop> after poirot have leave me <i|single> stroll down the beach and <watch|follow> the bather without <feel|smell> energetic enough to join them i rather fancy that cinderella might be disport herself amongst them in some wonderful costume but i <saw|realize> no sign of her i stroll aimlessly along the sand towards the further end of the town it occur to me that after all it would only <be|follow> decent feel on my part to inquire after the girl and it would save trouble in the <end|remainder> the matter would <then|so> be <finish|polish> with there would be no need for me to <trouble|worry> about her any further but if i do not go at all she might quite possibly come and look me up at the villa and that would be annoy in every way decidedly it would be better to pay a short call in the course of which i could make it quite clear that i could <do|come> nothing further for her in my capacity of showman accordingly <i|single> leave the beach and walk inland i <soon|presently> find the hotel du phare a very unpretentious <build|establish> it be annoy in the extreme not to know the lady's <name|distinguish> and to save my dignity i decide to stroll inside and look around probably i should find her in the lounge merlinville be a small place you leave your hotel to go to the beach and you leave the beach to return to the hotel there be no other attraction there be a casino be build but it <be|follow> not yet complete i have walk the length of the beach without see her therefore she must be in the hotel i go in <several|various> <people|multitude> be sit in the tiny lounge but my quarry be not amongst them i look into some other room but there be no <sign|mark> of her i wait for some time till my impatience get the better of me i take the concierge aside and slip five franc into his hand i wish to see a <lady|madam> who be stay here a young english lady small and dark i <be|follow> not sure of her <name|key> the man shake his head and seem to be suppress a <grin|smile> there be no such lady a you describe stay here she <be|follow> american possibly i suggest these fellow be so stupid but the man continue to shake his head no monsieur there be only six or seven english and american <lady|madam> <altogether|wholly> and they be all <much|practically> older than the lady you be seek it be not here that you will find her monsieur he be so positive that i felt doubt but the <lady|madam> tell me she be stay here monsieur must have make a mistake or it be more likely the <lady|madam> do since there have <be|follow> another gentleman here inquire for her what be that you say i cry surprise but yes monsieur a gentleman who describe her just a you have <do|come> what be he like he be a small gentleman <well|intimately> dress very neat very spotless the moustache very <stiff|besotted> the head of a <peculiar|special> shape and the eye <green|common> poirot so that be why he refuse to <let|have> me accompany him to the station the impertinence of it i would thank him not to meddle in my <concern|occupy> <do|come> he fancy i <need|take> a nurse to look after me thank the man i depart somewhat at a loss and still much incense with my meddlesome friend i regret that he be for the moment out of reach i should have enjoy <tell|say> him what i <think|consider> of his unwarranted interference <have|make> i not distinctly tell him that i have no intention of see the <girl|miss> <decidedly|unquestionably> one's friend can be too zealous but where be the lady i <set|do> aside my <wrath|anger> and try to puzzle it out evidently through inadvertence she have name the wrong hotel then another think strike me be it <inadvertence|heedlessness> or have she deliberately withhold her <name|mention> and give me the wrong address the more i <think|consider> <about|near> it the more i felt convince that this last surmise of mine be right for some reason or other she do not wish to let the acquaintance ripen into friendship and though half an hour earlier this have be precisely my own <view|persuasion> i do not enjoy <have|let> the table turn upon me the whole affair be profoundly unsatisfactory and i go up to the villa genevieve in a condition of distinct ill humour i do not go to the house but go up the path to the little bench by the shed and sit there moodily enough i be distract from my thought by the <sound|profound> of voice close at hand in a second or two i realize that they come not from the garden i be in but from the adjoin garden of the villa <marguerite|moon_daisy> and that they be approach rapidly a girl's voice be speak a voice that i recognize a that of the beautiful marthe _cheri___ she be say be it really true be all our trouble over you <know|recognize> it marthe jack renauld reply nothing can part u <now|immediately> beloved the <last|live> obstacle to our union be

fair young goddess they <seem|appear> make for each other a they stand there happy in spite of the terrible tragedy that overshadow their young <live|go> but the girl's face <be|follow> trouble and jack renauld <seem|appear> to recognize it a he <hold|obtain> her closer to him and ask but what be you afraid of darling what be there to fear now and then i saw the look in her eye the look poirot have speak of a she murmur so that i almost guess at the word i be afraid for _you___ i do not hear young renauld's answer for my attention be distract by an unusual appearance a little further down the <hedge|dodge> there appear to be a brown bush there which <seem|appear> odd to say the least of it so early in the summer <i|single> <step|measure> along to investigate but at my <advance|win> the brown bush withdraw itself precipitately and face me with a finger to it lip it be giraud enjoin caution he lead the <way|direction> round the shed until we be out of ear shoot what be you do there i ask exactly what you be do listen but i be not there on purpose ah say giraud i be a always i admire the man whilst dislike him he <look|appear> me up and down with a sort of contemptuous disfavour you didn't help matter by butt in i might have hear something useful in a <minute|bit> what <have|take> you do with your old fossil <m|thousand> poirot have <go|fling> to paris i reply coldly and i can tell you m giraud that he be anything but an old fossil he have solve many <case|caseful> that <have|let> completely baffle the english police bah the english police giraud snap his finger disdainfully they must <be|follow> on a level with our examine magistrate so he have go to paris have he well a good thing the longer he stay there the <better|upright> but what do he think he will <find|happen> there i think i read in the question a tinge of uneasiness i draw myself up that i be not at liberty to say i say quietly giraud subject me to a pierce stare he have probably enough sense not to tell _you___ he remark rudely good afternoon i'm busy and with that he turn <on|along> his heel and leave me without ceremony matter <seem|appear> at a <standstill|tie-up> at the villa genevieve giraud <evidently|plainly> do not desire my company and from what i <have|give> <see|ensure> it seem <fairly|pretty> certain that jack renauld do not either i go back to the town have an enjoyable bath and return to the hotel i turn in early wonder whether the follow day would bring forth anything of interest i be wholly unprepared for what it do bring forth i be eat my petit dejeuner in the din <room|way> when the waiter who <have|take> be <talk|sing> to some one outside come back in obvious excitement he hesitate for a minute fidget with his napkin and then burst out monsieur

be dim the place be a mere rough wooden erection to keep old pot and <tool|creature> in i have enter impetuously but on the threshold i check myself <fascinate|capture> by the spectacle before me giraud <be|follow> on his hand and knee a pocket torch in his hand with which he be examine every inch of the grind he look up with a frown at my entrance then his face relax a little in a sort of good <humour|mood> contempt ah _c'est l'anglais enter then let u see what you can <make|do> of this affair rather sting by his tone i stoop my <head|guide> and pas in there he be say giraud flash his torch to the far corner i step across the dead man lay straight upon his <back|stake> he be of medium height swarthy of complexion and possibly about fifty <year|class> of age he be neatly dress in a dark blue <suit|case> well cut and probably make by an expensive tailor but not <new|young> his <face|side> be terribly convulse and on his leave side just over the heart the hilt of a dagger stand up

doubt what the <man|gentleman> die of he be stab to the heart and death must <have|make> be pretty <well|considerably> instantaneous when be it do last night giraud shake his head hardly i don't lay down the law on medical evidence but the man's be dead <well|easily> over twelve hour when do you say you last saw that dagger about ten o'clock yesterday morning <then|so> i should be incline to

<well|considerably> i <felt|find> fluster i i assume it oh what a fine detective look at him _mon petit___ do a man <stab|poke> to the heart fall like that neatly with his foot together and his arm to his side no again do a man lie down on his back and permit himself to be stab without raise a hand to defend himself it be absurd be it not but see here and here he flash the torch along the grind i saw curious irregular mark in the soft dirt he be drag here after he be dead half drag half carry by two people their track do not show on the hard grind outside and here they have be careful to obliterate them but one of the two be a woman my young friend a woman yes but if the track <be|follow> obliterate how do you know because blur a they be the print of the woman's shoe be unmistakable also by _this___ and lean forward he draw something from the handle of the dagger and hold it up for me to see it be a woman's long black hair similar to the one poirot have take from the arm chair in the library with a slightly ironic smile he wind it round the dagger again we will leave thing a they <be|follow> a much a possible he explain it please the examine magistrate _eh bien___ do you <notice|find> anything else i be force to shake my head look at his <hand|script> i do the nail be break and discolour and the skin be hard it <hardly|just> enlighten me a <much|often> a i should have

saw my chance you <see|realize> the plan be to <substitute|deputize> some of the de beer diamond for some sample diamond <bring|fetch> from south america by two young prospector who happen to be in <kimberley|Kimberley> at the time suspicion be then bind to <fall|come> on them very clever interpolate the count approvingly the colonel be always clever well i do my part but i <also|likewise> do one thing which the colonel have not foresee i keep back some of the south american stone one or two be unique and could <easily|well> be prove never to have pas through de beer's hand with these diamond in my possession i have the whip hand of my esteem chief <once|formerly> the two young men be clear his part in the matter be bind to be suspect i have say nothing all these year i have be content to know that i <have|make> this weapon in reserve but now matter be different i want my price and it will be a big i might almost say a stagger price extraordinary say the count and doubtless

south africa ask the count negligently yes since you <ask|take> it in south africa that be your native country be it not she nod her visitor rise and reach for his hat well he remark you know your own business <best|upright> but if i be you i should fear the colonel far more than any <disillusion|disenchant> lover he be a man whom it be particularly easy to underestimate she laugh scornfully a if i do not know him after all these year i wonder if you do he say softly i very much wonder if you do oh i be not a fool and i be not alone in this the south african mail boat dock at southampton to morrow and on <board|plank> her be a man who have come specially from africa at my request and who <have|make> carry out certain order of mine the colonel will have not one of u to deal with but two be that wise it be necessary you be sure of this man a rather peculiar smile play over the dancer's face i <be|follow> quite sure of him he be inefficient but perfectly trustworthy she pause and <then|so> add in an indifferent <tone|look> of voice a a <matter|weigh> of fact he happen to be my husband everybody have be at me right and leave to <write|pen> this story from the great <represent|defend> by lord nasby to the <small|humble> represent by our late maid of all work emily whom i saw when i be last in england lor' miss what a beyewtiful book you might make out of it all <just|precisely> like the picture i'll admit that i've certain qualification for the task i be mix up in the affair from the very begin i be in the <thick|deep> of it all through and i <be|follow> triumphantly in at the death very fortunately too the <gap|break> that i cannot supply from my own knowledge be amply cover by sir eustace pedler's <diary|journal> of which he have kindly beg me to make use so here go anne beddingfeld start to narrate her adventure i'd always long for adventure you see my life <have|make> such a dreadful sameness my <father|don> professor beddingfeld be one of england's <greatest|large> live authority on primitive man he really be a genius every one <admit|acknowledge> that his mind dwell in palaeolithic time and the inconvenience of life for him be that his body inhabit the modern <world|existence> <papa|pappa> do not care for modern man even neolithic man he despise a a mere herder of cattle and he do not rise to enthusiasm until he reach the mousterian period unfortunately one cannot entirely dispense with modern men one be force to have some kind of truck with butcher and baker and milkman and greengrocer therefore papa be immerse in the past mamma have <die|go> when i be a <baby|child> it fell to me to undertake the practical side of live frankly i <hate|hatred> palaeolithic man be he aurignacian mousterian chellian or anything else and though i type and revise most of papa's _neanderthal man and his ancestor <neanderthal|neandertal> men themselves fill me with loathe and i always reflect what a fortunate circumstance it be that they become extinct in remote age i do not know whether papa guess my feel on the subject <probably|plausibly> not and in any <case|face> he would not have be <interest|pursuit> the opinion of other people never interest him in the slightest degree i think it be <really|truly> a sign of his greatness in the same <way|room> he live quite detach from the necessity of daily life he eat what be put before him in an exemplary fashion but seem mildly pain when the <question|inquiry> of pay for it arise we never seem to have any money his celebrity be not of the kind that bring in a cash return although he be a fellow of almost every important society and have row of letter after his name the general public scarcely know of his existence and his <long|tenacious> learn book though add signally to the <sum|total> total of human knowledge have no attraction for the <mass|mint> only on one occasion <do|come> he leap into the public gaze he have read a paper before some society <on|along> the <subject|matter> of the young of the chimpanzee the young of the human race show some anthropoid feature whereas the young of the chimpanzee approach more nearly to the human than the adult chimpanzee <do|come> that seem to show that whereas our ancestor be more simian than we be the chimpanzee's be of a higher type than the present specie in other word the chimpanzee be a <degenerate|dissolute> that enterprising newspaper the _daily budget be hard up for something <spicy|piquant> immediately bring itself out with large headline we be not <descend|come> from monkey but be monkey descend from _us eminent professor say chimpanzee be decadent human shortly afterwards a reporter call to see papa and endeavour to induce him to write a series of popular article on the theory i have seldom see papa so angry he turn the reporter out of the house with scant ceremony much to my <secret|mysterious> <sorrow|sadness> a we be particularly short of money at the <moment|minute> in fact for a moment i meditate run after the young man and inform him that my father have change his <mind|judgment> and would send the article in question i could easily have write them myself and the probability be that papa would never have <learn|instruct> of the transaction not be a reader of the _daily budget however i reject this course a be too risky so <i|single> merely put on my best hat and <go|get> sadly down the village to interview our justly irate grocer the reporter from the _daily budget_ <be|follow> the only young man who ever come to our house there be time when i envy emily our little servant who walk out whenever occasion offer with a large sailor to whom she be affiance in between time to keep her hand in a she <express|convey> it she walk out with the greengrocer's young <man|human> and the chemist's assistant i reflect sadly that i have no <one|nonpareil> to keep my hand in with all papa's friend be age professor usually with long beard it be true that professor peterson once clasp me affectionately and say i have a <neat|great> little waist and then try to kiss me the phrase alone date him hopelessly no self respect female <have|take> have a neat little waist since i be in my cradle i yearn for adventure for <love|screw> for romance and i <seem|appear> condemn to an existence of <drab|dreary> <utility|public_utility> the village posse a lend library full of tattered work of fiction and i enjoy peril and love make at second <hand|reach> and go to sleep dream of <stern|severe> silent rhodesians and of strong men who always fell their opponent with a single blow there be no one in the village who even look a though he could fell an opponent with a <single|undivided> blow or with several there be the kinema too with a weekly episode of the peril of pamela pamela be a magnificent <young|new> woman nothing daunt her she fell out of aeroplane adventure in submarine climb skyscraper and creep about in the underworld without turn a hair she be not really <clever|cunning> the master criminal of the underworld catch her each time but a he seem loath to <knock|criticize> her on the <head|chief> in a simple way and always doom her to death in a sewer gas chamber or by some new and marvellous mean the <hero|sub> be <always|invariably> able to rescue her at the <begin|start> of the follow week's <episode|sequence> i use to come out with my head in a <delirious|frantic> whirl and then i would get home and find a notice from the gas company threaten to cut u off if the outstanding account be not pay and yet though i do not suspect it every moment be bring adventure <nearer|closer> to me it be possible that there be many people in the world who have never hear of the find of an antique skull at the break hill mine in northern rhodesia i come down one morning to find papa <excite|charge> to the point of apoplexy he pour out the whole story to me you understand anne there be undoubtedly certain resemblance to the java skull but superficial superficial only no here we have what i have always maintain the ancestral <form|kind> of the <neanderthal|Neanderthalian> race you grant that the gibraltar skull be the most primitive of the neanderthal skull find why the cradle of the race be in africa they pas to europe not marmalade on kipper papa i say hastily arrest my parent's absent <mind|judgment> hand yes you <be|follow> say they pas to europe on here he break down with a bad <fit|suit> of choke the result of an immoderate mouthful of kipper bone but we must start at once he declare a he rise to his foot at the conclusion of the meal there <be|follow> no time to be lose we must be on the spot there be doubtless incalculable find to be find in the neighbourhood i shall be interest to note whether the implement be typical of the mousterian period there will be the remain of the primitive ox i should say but not those of the woolly rhinoceros yes a little army will <be|follow> <start|first> soon we must get ahead of them you will write to cook's to day anne what about money papa i hint delicately he turn a reproachful eye upon me your point of <view|prospect> always depress me my child we must not be sordid no no in the cause of science one must not be sordid i feel cook's might be sordid papa <papa|pop> look pain my dear anne you will pay them in ready money i haven't get any ready money papa look thoroughly exasperate my child i really cannot be bother with these vulgar money detail the bank i have something from the <manager|coach> yesterday say i have twenty seven <pound|poke> that's your overdraft i fancy ah i have it write to my publisher i acquiesce doubtfully papa's book bring in more glory than money i like the idea of go to rhodesia immensely stern silent men i murmur to myself in an ecstasy <then|so> something in my parent's <appearance|show> strike me a unusual you <have|make> odd boot on <papa|pappa> i say take off the brown one and put on the other black one and don't forget your <muffler|silencer> it's a very cold day in a few minute papa <stalk|stalking> off correctly boot and <well|intimately> mufflered he return late that even and to my dismay i saw his <muffler|damper> and <overcoat|topcoat> be miss dear me anne you <be|follow> quite right i take them off to go into the cavern one get so dirty there i nod feelingly remember an occasion when papa have return literally plaster from head to foot with rich pleiocene clay our principal reason for settle in little hampsly <have|give> be the neighbourhood of hampsly cavern a bury cave rich in deposit of the aurignacian culture we have a tiny museum in the <village|settlement> and the <curator|conservator> and papa spend most of their day mess about underground and bring to light <portion|part> of woolly rhinoceros and cave bear papa cough badly all the even and the follow morning i saw he have a temperature and send for the <doctor|repair> poor papa he never have a chance it <be|follow> double pneumonia he die four day later every one be very kind to me daze a i be i appreciate that i felt no overwhelm grief papa have never love me i know that well enough if he have i might have love him in return no there have not be <love|know> between u but we have belong together and i have look after him and <have|take> secretly admire his <learn|read> and his uncompromising devotion to science and it hurt me that <papa|dada> should have die just when the interest of life be at it height for him i should have felt happier if i could have bury him in a cave with <paint|key> of reindeer and flint implement but the force of public opinion constrain a neat tomb with marble slab in our hideous local churchyard the vicar's consolation though well mean do not console me in the least it take some time to dawn upon me that the thing i <have|take> always long for freedom be at last mine i be an orphan and practically penniless but free at the same time i realize the extraordinary kindness of all these good people the vicar do his <best|good> to persuade me that his wife be in urgent need of a companion <help|assist> our tiny local library suddenly make up it mind to have an <assistant|supporter> librarian finally the doctor call upon me and after make <various|several> ridiculous <excuse|apology> for fail to send in a proper bill he hum and haw a good deal and suddenly suggest that i should marry him i be very much astonish the doctor be nearer forty than thirty and a round tubby little man he be not at all like the hero of the peril of pamela and even le like a stern and silent rhodesian i reflect a minute and then ask him why he want to marry me that <seem|appear> to fluster him a good deal and he murmur that a wife be a great help to a general practitioner the position seem even more unromantic than before and yet something in me urge towards it acceptance safety that be what i be be offer <safety|refuge> and a comfortable home think it over now i believe i do the <little|trivial> man an injustice he be honestly in <love|enjoy> with me but a mistake delicacy prevent him from press his suit on those line anyway my love of romance rebel it's <extremely|exceedingly> kind of you i say but it's impossible i could never marry a man unless i love him madly you don't think no i don't i say firmly he sigh but my dear child what do you propose to do have adventure and see the world i reply without the least hesitation miss anne you be very much of a child still you don't understand the practical <difficulty|trouble> yes i do doctor i'm not a sentimental schoolgirl i'm a hard head mercenary shrew you'd know it if you marry me i wish you would reconsider i can't he sigh again <i|single> have another proposal to make an aunt of mine who live in wale be in want of a young lady to help her how would that suit you no doctor i'm go to london if thing happen anywhere they happen in london i shall keep my eye open and you'll see something will turn up you'll hear of me next in <china|Nationalist_China> or timbuctoo my next visitor be mr flemming papa's london solicitor he come down <specially|especially> from town to see me an ardent anthropologist himself he be a great admirer of papa's work he be a tall spare <man|valet> with a thin face and grey hair he rise to <meet|see> me a i enter the room and take both my hand in his pat them affectionately my <poor|short> child he say my <poor|miserable> <poor|piteous> child without conscious hypocrisy i <find|obtain> myself assume the <demeanour|conduct> of a bereave orphan he hypnotize me into it he be <benignant|gracious> kind and fatherly and without the least doubt he regard me a a perfect fool of a girl leave <adrift|directionless> to face an unkind world from the first i felt that it <be|follow> quite useless to try to convince him of the contrary a thing turn out perhaps it <be|follow> just a well i didn't my dear child do you think you can listen to me whilst i try to make a few thing clear to you oh yes your father a you know be a very great man posterity <will|leave> appreciate him but he be not a good man of <business|concern> i know that quite a <well|intimately> if not <better|respectable> than mr flemming but i restrain myself from say so he continue i do not suppose you understand much of these matter i will try to explain a clearly a i can he explain at unnecessary length the upshot seem to be that i be leave to face life with the sum of ps87 17 4d it seem a strangely unsatisfying amount i wait in some trepidation for what be come next i fear that mr flemming would be <sure|certain> to have an aunt in scotland who be in <want|lack> of a bright young companion apparently <however|still> he hadn't the question be he go <on|along> the future i <understand|realize> you have no <live|last> relative i'm alone in the world i say and be strike anew by my liken to a film heroine you <have|give> friend every one have be

out to earn my live you know yes yes my dear child i quite understand we will <look|expect> round for something <suitable|desirable> i <felt|find> instinctively that mr flemming's idea of something suitable and mine be likely to be widely divergent but it be certainly not the moment i ring the bell and a smile kafir boy answer it mr raffini i inquire he usher me in precede me down the passage and fling open a door just a <i|single> be about to pas in i hesitate i felt a sudden misgive i step over the threshold and the <door|threshold> swing sharply to behind me a man rise from his <seat|invest> behind a table and come forward with outstretched hand so glad we have persuade you to visit u miss beddingfeld he say he be a <tall|improbable> man obviously a <dutchman|Netherlander> with a flame orange beard he <do|come> not look in the least like the curator of a museum in fact i realize in a flash that i have make a fool of myself i be in the <hand|paw> of the enemy it remind me forcibly of episode iii in the peril of pamela how <often|frequently> have i not sit in the sixpenny seat eat a twopenny bar of milk <chocolate|burnt_umber> and yearn for similar thing to <happen|find> to me well they have happen with a vengeance and somehow it be not nearly so amuse a i have imagine it's all very <well|easily> <on|along> the screen you have the comfortable knowledge that there's bind to be an episode iv but in real life there be absolutely no guarantee that anna the adventure might not terminate abruptly at the end of any episode yes i be in a tight place all the thing that rayburn have say that morning come back to me with unpleasant distinctness <tell|say> the truth he have say well i could always do that but be it go to help me to begin with would my story be <believe|consider> would they consider it likely or possible that i have start off <on|along> this <mad|delirious> escapade simply on the strength of a scrap of paper smell of moth ball it sound to me a wildly incredible tale in that <moment|import> of cold sanity i curse myself for a melodramatic idiot and yearn for the peaceful boredom of little hampsly all this pas through my mind in le time than it take to tell my first instinctive <movement|drift> be to step backwards and <feel|find> for the handle of the door my captor merely grin here you <be|follow> and here you stay he remark facetiously <i|single> do my best to put a bold face upon the <matter|issue> i be invite to come here by the curator of the cape town museum if i have <make|establish> a mistake a mistake oh yes a big mistake he laugh coarsely what right have you to detain me i shall inform the police <yap|gob> yap yap like a little toy dog he laugh i sit down on a chair i can only conclude that you be a dangerous lunatic i say coldly indeed i should like to <point|sharpen> out to you that my friend be perfectly well aware where i have go and that if i have not return by this even they <will|leave> come in search of me you understand so your friend know where you be do they which of them thus challenge i do a lightning calculation of <chance|prospect> should i <mention|note> sir eustace he be a <well|swell> know man and his name might carry weight but if they be in touch with pagett they might know i be lie better not risk sir eustace mr blair for one i say lightly a friend of mine with whom i be stay i <think|remember> not say my captor slyly shake his orange head you have not see her since eleven this morning and you <receive|find> our note bid you come here at lunch <time|sentence> his word show me how closely my <movement|move> have be follow but <i|single> be not go to give in without a fight you be very clever i say perhaps you have hear of that useful invention the telephone mr blair call me up <on|along> it when i be rest in my room after lunch i tell her then where i be go this afternoon to my great satisfaction i saw a shade of uneasiness pas over his <face|side> clearly he have overlook the possibility that suzanne might have telephone to me i wish she really have do so enough of this he say harshly rise what be you go to do with me i ask still endeavour to appear compose put you where you can do no harm in case your friend <come|follow> after you for a <moment|minute> my blood run cold but his next word <reassure|assure> me to morrow you'll have some question to answer and after you've answer them we shall know what to do with you and i can tell you young lady we've more way than one of make obstinate little fool talk it be not cheer but it be at least a respite i have until to morrow this man be clearly an underling obey the order of a <superior|master> could that superior by any chance be pagett he call and two kafir appear i be take upstairs despite my struggle i be gag and then bind hand and foot the room into which they have take me be a kind of attic right under the roof it be dusty and <show|establish> little sign of have <be|follow> occupy the dutchman make a mock bow and withdraw close the door behind him i be <quite|rather> helpless turn and twist a i would i could not loosen my hand in the slightest <degree|level> and the gag prevent me from cry out if by any possible chance any one do come to the house i could do <nothing|cipher> to attract their attention down below i hear the sound of a door shut <evidently|plainly> the dutchman be go out it be madden not to be able to do anything i strain again at my bond but the knot hold i desist at <last|final> and either faint or fell asleep when i awake i <be|follow> in <pain|ail> all over it be quite dark now and i judge that the <night|dark> must be well advance for the moon be high in the heaven and shin down through the dusty skylight the gag be half choke me and the stiffness and pain be unendurable it be then that my eye fell on a bite of break glass lie in the corner a moonbeam slant right down on it and it glisten have catch my attention a i look at it an idea come into my head my arm and leg be helpless but surely i could still _roll slowly and awkwardly i set myself in motion it be not easy besides be <extremely|exceedingly> painful since i could not guard my face with my arm it be also exceedingly difficult to keep any particular direction i tend to roll in every direction except the one i want to go in the end however i come right up against my objective it almost touch my bind <hand|script> even then it be not <easy|comfortable> it take an infinity of time before i could wriggle the glass into such a <position|place> wedge against the wall that it would rub up and down on my bond it be a long heart rend process and i <almost|nearly> despair but in the end i succeed in saw through the cord that bind my wrist the rest be a matter of time once i have restore the circulation to my hand by rub the wrist vigorously i be able to undo the gag one or two <full|good> breath do a lot for me very soon i have undo the last <knot|gnarl> though even then it <be|follow> some time before i could stand on my foot but at last i stand erect swing my arm to and fro to restore the circulation and wish above all thing that i could <get|have> hold of something to eat i <wait|expect> <about|near> a quarter of an hour to be quite <sure|certain> of my recover strength then i tiptoe noiselessly to the <door|doorway> a i have hop it be not lock only latch i unlatched it and peep cautiously out everything be still the moonlight come in through a window and show me the dusty uncarpeted staircase cautiously i creep down it <still|yet> no sound but a i stand on the land below a faint murmur of voice reach me i stop dead and stand there for some time a clock on the wall register the fact that it be after midnight i be fully aware of the risk i might run if i <descend|come> lower but my <curiosity|peculiarity> be too much for me with infinite precaution i prepare to explore i <creep|fawn> softly down the last flight of stair and stand in the square hall <i|single> look round me and then catch my breath with a gasp a kafir boy <be|follow> sit by the <hall|mansion> <door|doorway> he have not see me indeed i soon realize by his breathe that he be fast asleep should i retreat or should i go on the voice <come|descend> from the room i have be show into on arrival one of them be that of my dutch friend the other i could not for the moment recognize though it seem vaguely familiar in the end i decide that it be clearly my duty to hear all i could i must risk the <kafir|Kafir> boy wake up i cross the hall noiselessly and kneel by the study door for a moment or two i could hear no better the voice <be|follow> louder but i could not distinguish what they say i apply my eye to the keyhole instead of my ear a i have guess one of the speaker be the big dutchman the other man be sit outside my circumscribe range of vision suddenly he rise to get himself a drink his back black clothe and decorous come into view even before he turn round i know who he be mr chichester now i begin to make out the word all the same it be dangerous suppose her friend come after her it be the <big|large> man speak chichester answer him he have <drop|fell> his clerical voice entirely no wonder i have not <recognize|know> it all bluff they haven't an idea where she be she speak very positively i dare say i've <look|await> into the matter and we've nothing to fear anyway it's the colonel s' order you don't want to go against them i suppose the <dutchman|Netherlander> ejaculate something in his own language i judge it to be a hasty disclaimer but why not knock her on the head he growl it would <be|follow> simple the boat be all ready she could be take out to sea yes say chichester meditatively that be what i should do she know too much that be certain but the colonel be a man who like to play a lone hand though no one else must do so something in his own word <seem|appear> to awaken a memory that annoy him he want <information|data> of some <kind|variety> from this <girl|miss> he have pause before the information and the dutchman be quick to catch him up information something of the <kind|form> diamond i say to myself and <now|instantly> continue chichester give me the list for a long time their conversation be quite <incomprehensible|inexplicable> to me it seem to deal with large quantity of vegetable date be mention <price|damage> and various name of <place|position> which i do not know it be quite half an hour before they have finish their check and count good say chichester and there be a sound a though he push back his chair i will <take|have> these with me for the colonel to see when do you leave ten o'clock to morrow morning will do do you want to see the girl before you go no there be strict order that no one be to see her until the colonel come be she all right i look in on her when i come in for dinner she be asleep i think what about food a little starvation will do no harm the colonel will be here some time to morrow she will answer question better if she <be|follow> hungry no <one|i> <have|get> <better|safe> go near her till then be she securely tie up the dutchman laugh what <do|make> you think they both laugh so do i <under|below> my <breath|intimation> then a the sound seem to betoken that they be about to come out of the <room|board> i <beat|get> a hasty retreat i be just in time a i reach the <head|lead> of the stair <i|single> hear the door of the room open and at the same time the kafir stir and <move|go> my retreat by the <way|manner> of the hall door be not to be think of i retire prudently to the attic gather my bond <round|assault> me and lay down again on the floor in case they should take it into their <head|steer> to come and look at me they do not do <so|therefore> however after about an hour i creep down the stair but the kafir by the <door|doorway> <be|follow> awake and hum softly to himself i be anxious to get out of the house but i <do|make> not quite see how to <manage|do> it in the end i be force to retreat to the attic again the kafir be clearly on guard for the night i remain there patiently all through the sound of early <morning|aurora> preparation the <men|valet> breakfast in the hall i could hear their <voice|part> distinctly float up the <stair|step> i be get thoroughly unnerve how <on|along> earth be i to get out of the house <i|single> <counsel|advise> myself to be patient a rash move might spoil everything after breakfast come the sound of chichester depart to my intense relief the <dutchman|Hollander> accompany him i wait breathlessly breakfast be be clear away the work of the house be <be|follow> do at last the various activity seem to <die|go> down i slip out from my lair once more very <carefully|cautiously> i creep down the stair the hall be empty like a flash i be across it have unlatched the door and be outside in the sunshine i run down the drive like one posse once outside i resume a normal walk people star at me curiously and i do not wonder my face and clothe must have be cover in <dust|sprinkle> from roll about in the attic at last i come to a garage i <go|fling> in i have <meet|see> with an <accident|stroke> i explain i want a car to <take|consider> me to cape town at once i must catch the boat to durban i have not long to wait ten minute later i be speed along in the <direction|charge> of <cape|mantle> town i must know if chichester be on the boat whether to sail on her myself or not i could not <determine|see> but in the <end|stop> i decide to do so chichester would not know that i have see him in the villa at muizenberg he would doubtless <lay|repose> further trap for me but i be forewarn and he be the man i be after the man who be seek the diamond on behalf of the mysterious colonel ala for my plan a i arrive at the <dock|wharf> the _kilmorden castle_ be steam out to sea and i have no mean of know whether chichester have sail on her or not i drive to the hotel there be no one in the lounge that i know i run upstairs and tap on suzanne's door her <voice|representative> bid me come in when she saw who it be she literally fell <on|along> my neck anne dear where have you be i've be worry to death about you what have you be do have adventure i reply episode iii of 'the <peril|menace> of pamela i tell her the whole story she give vent to a deep sigh when i finish why do these thing always happen to you she <demand|take> plaintively why do no one gag me and bind me hand and foot you wouldn't like it if they do i assure her to tell you the truth i'm not nearly so keen on have adventure myself a i be a little of that sort of <thing|affair> go a <long|tenacious> <way|manner> suzanne seem unconvinced an hour or two of gag and <bind|truss> would have change her view <quickly|rapidly> enough suzanne like thrill but she hat be uncomfortable and what be we all do <now|immediately> she ask i don't quite know i say thoughtfully you still <go|get> to rhodesia of course to <keep|save> an eye on pagett and you that be <just|precisely> my <difficulty|trouble> have chichester go on the _kilmorden or have he not do he mean to <carry|expect> out his original <plan|design> of go to durban the hour of his leave muizenberg seem to <point|sharpen> to an affirmative answer to both question in that case i might go to durban by train i <fancy|see> that i should <get|obtain> there before the boat on the other hand if the news of my escape be wire to chichester and also the <information|data> that i have <leave|give> <cape|mantle> town for durban nothing be simpler for him than to leave the boat at either port elizabeth or east london and so give me the slip completely it be rather a knotty problem we'll inquire about train to durban anyway <i|single> say and it's not too late for morning tea say suzanne we'll have it in the <lounge|lurk> the <durban|Durban> train leave at that even so they tell me at the office for the moment i postpone <decision|determination> and join suzanne for <somewhat|slightly> belated eleven o'clock tea <do|make> you feel that you would really recognize chichester again in any other disguise i mean ask suzanne i shake my head ruefully i certainly didn't recognize him a the stewardess and never should have but for your <draw|reap> the man's a professional actor i'm sure of it say suzanne thoughtfully his make up be perfectly marvellous he might <come|follow> off the boat a a navvy or something and you'd never spot him you're very <cheer|barrack> i say at that minute colonel <race|hasten> step in through the window and <come|descend> and join u what be sir eustace do ask suzanne i haven't <see|realize> him about to day rather an odd expression pas over the colonel's face he's <get|make> a little trouble of his own to attend to which be <keep|save> him busy <tell|state> u about it i mustn't tell tale out of school <tell|say> u something <even|yet> if you have to invent it for our special benefit well what would you say to the famous 'man in the brown suit' have make the <voyage|sail> with u what i felt the colour die out of my face and then surge back again fortunately colonel <race|hasten> <be|follow> not look at me it's a fact i believe every port watch for him and he bamboozle pedler into <bring|get> him out a his secretary not mr pagett oh not pagett the other fellow rayburn he call himself have they arrest him ask suzanne under the table she give my hand a reassure squeeze i wait breathlessly for an <answer|resolution> he seem to have disappear into thin air how do sir eustace take it regard it a a personal insult offer him by fate an opportunity of hear sir eustace's view on the matter present itself later in the day we be awaken from a refresh afternoon nap by a page boy with a note in touch term it request the pleasure of our company at tea in his <sit|model> room the poor man be indeed in a pitiable state he pour out his trouble to u encourage by suzanne's sympathetic murmur she do that sort of thing very well first a perfectly <strange|unusual> woman have the impertinence to get herself murder in my house on purpose to annoy me i do believe why my house why of all the house in great britain choose the mill <house|firm> what harm have i ever do the woman that she must need get herself murder there suzanne make one of her sympathetic noise again and sir eustace proceed in a <still|however> more aggrieve tone and if that's not enough the fellow who murder her <have|take> the impudence the colossal <impudence|insolence> to attach himself to me a my secretary my secretary if you please i'm tire of secretary i won't have <any|whatever> more secretary either they're conceal murderer or else they're drunken brawler <have|give> you see pagett's black eye but of course you have how can i <go|fling> about with a secretary like that and his face <be|follow> such a nasty <shade|ghost> of yellow too

of her purpose i warn her know what kind of man she have to <deal|take> with but she do not take my advice there be a wireless message on the table i read it afterwards i think i would <have|give> a try for the diamond myself in johannesburg mr rayburn accost me he persuade me to come over to his side sir eustace look at him he say nothing but mink <seem|appear> visibly to wilt rat always leave a sink <ship|embark> observe sir eustace i don't care for rat sooner or later i destroy vermin there's just one thing i'd like to tell you sir eustace i remark that tin you throw out of the window didn't contain the diamond it have common pebble in it the diamond be in a perfectly safe place a a <matter|count> of fact they're in the big giraffe's stomach suzanne hollow it out put the diamond in with cotton wool so that they wouldn't rattle and plug it up again sir eustace look at me for some time his reply be characteristic i always do hate that <blink|wink> giraffe he say it must have <be|follow> instinct we be not <able|capable> to return to johannesburg that night the shell be come over pretty fast and i gather that we be now more or le cut off owe to the <rebel|rise> have obtain possession of a new part of the suburb our <place|order> of refuge be a <farm|raise> some twenty mile or so from <johannesburg|Johannesburg> right out on the veld i be drop with fatigue all the excitement and anxiety of the last two day have leave me little better than a limp rag i keep repeat to myself without be able to believe it that our trouble be really over harry and i be together and we should never be separate again yet all through i be conscious of some barrier between u a constraint on his part the reason of which i could not fathom sir eustace have be <drive|take> off in an opposite direction accompany by a strong guard he wave his hand airily to u on depart i come out on to the _stoep_ early on the follow morning and look across the veld in the direction of <johannesburg|Johannesburg> i could <see|consider> the great <dump|ditch> glisten in the pale morning sunshine and i could hear the low rumble <mutter|gnarl> of the gun the <revolution|gyration> <be|follow> not over yet the farmer's wife come out and call me in to breakfast she be a kind motherly soul and i be already very fond of her harry have go out at dawn and have not yet <return|homecoming> so she inform me again i <felt|find> a stir of uneasiness pas over me what be this shadow of which i be so conscious between u after breakfast i sit out on the _stoep_ a book in my hand which i do not <read|say> i <be|follow> so lose in my own thought that i never saw colonel <race|speed> ride up and dismount from his horse it be not until he say good morning anne that i become aware of his presence oh i say with a flush it's you yes may i sit down he draw a chair up beside me it <be|follow> the first time we have be alone together since that day at the matoppos a always i felt that curious mixture of fascination and fear that he never fail to inspire in me what be the news i ask <smut|obscenity> will be in johannesburg to morrow i <give|leave> this outbreak three <day|daylight> more before it collapse utterly in the <meantime|lag> the fight go on i wish i say that one could be <sure|certain> that the right people be the one to get kill i mean the one who want to fight not just all the poor people who happen to live in the part where the fight be go on he nod i <know|recognize> what you mean anne that's the unfairness of war but i've other news for you yes a confession of <incompetency|incompetence> on my <part|character> pedler have manage to escape what yes no one know how he manage it he be securely lock up for the night in an upper story room of one of the <farm|produce> roundabout which the military have take over but this <morning|aurora> the room be empty and the bird have fly secretly <i|single> be rather please never to this day have i be able to rid myself of a sneak fondness for sir eustace i dare say it's reprehensible but there it <be|follow> i admire him he be a thorough <go|function> villain i dare say but he be a pleasant one i've never meet any one half so amuse since i conceal my feel of course naturally colonel <race|speed> would feel <quite|rather> differently about it he want sir eustace bring to justice there be nothing very surprise in his <escape|leak> when one <come|hail> to think of it all round jo'burg he must have innumerable spy and <agent|factor> and whatever colonel race might think i be exceedingly doubtful that they would <ever|always> catch him he probably have a <well|swell> plan line of retreat indeed he have say a much to u i express myself suitably though in a rather lukewarm manner and the conversation languish then colonel race <ask|expect> suddenly for harry i tell him that he have go off at dawn and that i hadn't see him this morning you <understand|see> don't you anne that apart from formality he be completely <clear|open> there be technicality of course but sir eustace's guilt be well assure there <be|follow> nothing now to <keep|save> you apart he say this without look at me in a slow jerky voice i understand i say gratefully and there be no reason why he should not at once resume his real name no of course not you know his real <name|describe> the question surprise me of course i do harry lucas he do not answer and something in the quality of his silence strike me a peculiar anne do you remember that a we <drive|take> home from the matoppos that day i tell you that i know what i have to do of course <i|single> remember i think that i may <fairly|pretty> say i <have|give> do it the man you <love|know> be clear of suspicion be that what you mean of course i hang my <head|principal> ashamed of the <baseless|unfounded> suspicion i have entertain he speak again in a thoughtful voice when i be a mere youngster i be in <love|bed> with a <girl|daughter> who jilt me after that i think only of my work my career mean everything to me then i meet you anne and all that seem worth nothing but youth's call to youth i've still get my work i be silent i suppose one can't really love two men at once but you can feel like it the magnetism of this man be very great i look up at him suddenly i <think|consider> that you'll go very far i say dreamily i think that you've get a <great|heavy> career ahead of you you'll be one of the world's big men i <felt|find> a though i be utter a prophecy i shall be alone though all the people who do really <big|liberal> thing <be|follow> you think so i'm sure of it he take my hand and say in a low voice i'd rather <have|take> have the other then harry come <stride|pace> round the corner of the <house|sign> colonel race rise good morning lucas he say for some reason harry flush <up|upward> to the <root|origin> of his hair yes i say gaily you must be know by your real <name|describe> now but harry be still star at colonel race so you know sir he say at last <i|single> never forget a face i saw you once a a boy what's all this about i ask puzzle look from one to the other it seem a conflict of will between them race win harry turn <slightly|somewhat> away i suppose you're right sir tell her my real name anne this isn't harry lucas harry lucas be kill in the war this <be|follow> john harold eardsley with his <last|final> word colonel race have swing away and leave u i stand star after him harry's voice recall me to myself anne forgive me say you forgive me he take my <hand|reach> in his and almost mechanically i draw it away why do you deceive me i don't know that i can make you understand i be afraid of all that sort of thing the power and fascination of wealth i want you to care for me just for myself for the man i be without ornament and trapping you mean you didn't trust me you can put it that way if you like but it isn't quite true i'd <become|get> embitter suspicious always prone to

we've be talk paris and frock i felt that it wasn't a bite <real|tangible> that you'd vanish into the blue some day to be marry over the tongs in the <good|upright> old <gipsy|itinerant> fashion but you _are_ a couple of lunatic this idea of renounce a vast fortune be absurd colonel race want to argue the <matter|topic> but i have persuade him to leave the argument to time he can administer the

<motor|centrifugal> and the latest thing in perambulator french maid and norland <nurse|entertain> oh yes you <will|leave> but have your honeymoon dear lunatic and <let|allow> it be a <long|tenacious> one and think of me sometimes comfortably put on weight amidst the fleshpots your <love|passion> friend suzanne blair p s i be send you an assortment of fry pan a a wed present and an enormous _terrine_ of _pate de foie gras_ to remind you of me there be another letter that i sometimes read it come a good while after the other and be accompany by a bulky packet it appear to <be|follow> write from somewhere in bolivia my dear anne beddingfeld i can't resist write to you not so much for the pleasure it give me to write a for the <enormous|tremendous> pleasure i <know|recognize> it will give you to <hear|see> from me our friend race wasn't quite a clever a he think himself be he i think i shall appoint you my literary executor i'm send you my diary there's nothing in it that would <interest|pursuit> race and his crowd but i fancy that there be passage in it which may amuse you make use of it in any way you like i suggest an article for the _daily budget criminal i have meet i only stipulate that i shall be the central figure by this <well|swell> _mon ami_ a good deal you can guess for yourself of course you realize that now mr inglethorp be out of it the whole position be greatly change we be face to face with an entirely new problem we know now that there be one person who do not buy the poison we have clear away the manufacture clue <now|immediately> for the <real|actual> one i have ascertain that anyone in the household with the exception of mr cavendish who be play tennis with you could have personate mr inglethorp on monday even in the same way we have his <statement|instruction> that he put the coffee down in the <hall|mansion> no one take much notice of that at the inquest but now it have a very different significance we must find out who do take that coffee to mr inglethorp eventually or who pas through the hall whilst it be stand there from your account there be only two people whom we can positively say do not go near the coffee mr cavendish and mademoiselle cynthia yes that be so i felt an inexpressible lighten of the heart mary cavendish could certainly not <rest|repose> under suspicion in clear alfred inglethorp continue poirot i have be oblige to <show|establish> my hand sooner than i intend a long a i might be think to be pursue him the criminal would be off his guard now he will be <doubly|twice> careful yes doubly careful he turn to me abruptly <tell|say> me <hastings|battle_of_Hastings> you yourself have you no suspicion of anybody i hesitate to tell the truth an idea wild and extravagant in itself have once or twice that morning flash through my brain i have reject it a absurd nevertheless it persist you couldn't call it a suspicion i murmur it's so utterly foolish come now urge poirot encouragingly do not fear speak your mind you should always <pay|give> attention to your instinct well then i <blurt|blunder> out it's absurd but <i|single> suspect miss howard of not <tell|say> all she know miss howard yes you'll laugh at me not at all why should i i can't help <feel|find> i continue blunderingly that we've rather leave her out of the possible suspect simply on the strength of her have be away from the <place|lay> but after all she be only fifteen mile away a car would do it in half an <hour|minute> can we say positively that she be away from style on the night of the murder yes my friend say poirot unexpectedly we can one of my first action be to ring up the hospital where she be work well <well|easily> i learn that miss howard <have|give> be on afternoon duty on tuesday and that a convoy come in unexpectedly she have kindly offer to remain on night duty which offer be gratefully <accept|assume> that dispose of that oh i say rather nonplus really i continue it's her extraordinary vehemence against inglethorp that start me off suspect her i can't help feel she'd do anything against him and i have an <idea|estimate> she might know something about the destroy of the will she might have burn the new one mistake it for the earlier one in his favour she be so terribly bitter against him you consider her vehemence unnatural y e she be <so|indeed> very violent i wonder really whether she be quite sane on that point poirot shake his <head|principal> energetically no no you be on a wrong tack there there be nothing weak <mind|judgment> or <degenerate|degraded> about miss howard she be an excellent specimen of <well|intimately> balance english <beef|kick> and brawn she <be|follow> sanity itself yet her hatred of inglethorp <seem|appear> almost a mania my idea be a very ridiculous one no doubt that she <have|let> intend to poison him and that in some way mr inglethorp get hold of it by <mistake|err> but i don't at all <see|realize> how it could have be do the whole thing be absurd and ridiculous to the <last|final> degree still you be right in one thing it be always wise to suspect everybody until you can <prove|establish> logically and to your own satisfaction that they be innocent now what reason be there against miss howard's have deliberately poison mr inglethorp why she <be|follow> devote to her i <exclaim|shout> tcha tcha <cry|yell> poirot <irritably|testily> you argue like a child if miss howard be capable of poison the old lady she would be <quite|rather> equally capable of simulate devotion no we must look elsewhere you be perfectly correct in your <assumption|laying_claim> that her vehemence against alfred inglethorp be too violent to be natural but you be quite wrong in the deduction you draw from it i have draw my own deduction which i believe to <be|follow> correct but i will not speak of them at present he pause a minute then go on now to my way of think there be one insuperable objection to miss howard's <be|follow> the murder and that be that in no possible way could mr inglethorp's death <benefit|gain> miss howard now there be no <murder|dispatch> without a motive i reflect could not mr inglethorp <have|give> make a will in her favour poirot shake his head but you yourself suggest that possibility to mr well poirot smile that be for a <reason|conclude> i do not want to mention the name of the person who be actually in my mind miss <howard|Catherine_Howard> occupy very much the same position so i use her name instead still mr inglethorp might have do so why that will make on the afternoon of her death may but poirot's shake of the head be so energetic that i stop no my friend i have certain <little|short> idea of my own about that will but i can <tell|say> you this much it be not in miss howard's <favour|prefer> i accept his <assurance|pledge> though i do not <really|very> see how he could be so positive about the matter well i say with a sigh we will acquit miss <howard|Leslie_Howard_Stainer> then it <be|follow> partly your <fault|break> that i ever come to suspect her it be what you say about her evidence at the inquest that <set|do> me off poirot look puzzle what do i say about her evidence at the inquest don't you remember when i cite her and john cavendish a be above suspicion oh ah yes he seem a little confuse but <recover|find> himself by the way hastings there be something i want you to do for me certainly what be it next time you <happen|find> to be alone with lawrence cavendish i want you to say this to him 'i <have|take> a message for you from poirot he say find the extra coffee cup and you can rest in peace nothing more nothing le 'find the extra coffee cup and you can rest in peace be that right i ask much mystify excellent but what do it mean ah that i will leave you to find out you have access to the fact just say that to him and see what he say very well but it's all extremely mysterious we <be|follow> run into tadminster now and poirot direct the car to the analytical chemist poirot hop down briskly and go inside in a few minute he be back again there he say that be all my business what <be|follow> you <do|come> there i ask in <lively|live> curiosity i leave something to be analyse yes but what the sample of cocoa i take from the saucepan in the bedroom but that have already be test i cry stupefy dr bauerstein have it <test|trial> and you yourself laugh at the possibility of there <be|follow> strychnine in it i know dr bauerstein have it test <reply|respond> poirot quietly well then well i have a <fancy|picture> for <have|make> it analyse again that be all and not another word on the <subject|field> could i drag out of him this proceed of poirot's in respect of the cocoa puzzle me intensely i could see neither rhyme nor reason in it however my <confidence|trust> in him which at one time have rather wan be fully restore since his belief in alfred inglethorp's innocence have be so triumphantly vindicate the funeral of mr inglethorp take place the follow day and on monday a i come down to a late breakfast <john|trick> <draw|get> me aside and inform me that mr inglethorp be leave that morning to <take|consider> up his quarter at the stylite arm until he should have complete his <plan|programme> and really it's a <great|large> relief to think he's <go|get> hastings continue my honest friend it be bad enough before when we think he'd <do|come> it but i'm hang if it isn't worse <now|instantly> when we all feel guilty for have be <so|therefore> down on the fellow the fact be we've treat him abominably of course thing do look black against him i don't see how anyone could blame u for jump to the <conclusion|decision> we do still there it be we be in the wrong and <now|immediately> there's a beastly feel that one ought to make amend which be difficult when one doesn't like the fellow a bite better than one do before the whole thing's damn awkward and i'm thankful he's have the tact to take himself off it's a good thing style wasn't the mater's to leave to him couldn't bear to think of the fellow <lord|master> it here he's welcome to her money you'll be able to keep up the <place|invest> all right i ask oh yes there <be|follow> the <death|end> duty of course but half my father's money <go|get> with the place and lawrence will stay with u for the present so there be his <share|part> a well we shall be pinch at first of course because a <i|single> <once|formerly> tell you i be in a bite of a <hole|fix> financially myself still the johnny <will|leave> wait now in the general relief at inglethorp's approach departure we have the most genial breakfast we have <experience|have> since the tragedy cynthia whose young spirit be naturally buoyant be look quite her pretty self again and we all with the <exception|exclusion> of <lawrence|Gertrude_Lawrence> who seem unalterably gloomy and nervous be quietly cheerful at the open of a new and hopeful future the paper of <course|feed> have be <full|total> of the tragedy glare headline sandwich biography of every member of the household subtle innuendo the usual familiar tag about the police have a <clue|hint> nothing be spar u it be a <slack|loose> time the war be momentarily inactive and the <newspaper|paper> seize with avidity on this <crime|offence> in fashionable life the mysterious affair at <style|title> be the topic of the moment naturally it be very annoy for the cavendish the <house|family> be constantly besiege by reporter who be consistently deny admission but who <continue|keep> to haunt the village and the ground where they lay in <wait|await> with camera for any unwary member of the household we all live in a <blast|bang> of publicity the scotland yard men come and go examine question lynx eye and reserve of tongue towards what end they be work we do not know have they any clue or would the whole thing remain in the <category|family> of undiscovered crime after breakfast dorcas come up to me rather mysteriously and ask if she might have a few word with me certainly what be it dorcas well it's just this sir you'll be see the belgian gentleman to day <perhaps|possibly> <i|single> nod well sir you know how he <ask|take> me <so|then> particular if the mistress or anyone else have a green dress yes yes you have find one my interest be arouse no not that sir but since then i've remember what the <young|new> gentleman john and lawrence be still the young gentleman to dorcas call the 'dressing up box it's up in the front attic sir a great chest full of old clothe and fancy dress and what not and it come to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst them so if you'd tell the belgian gentleman i will tell him dorcas i promise thank you very much sir a very nice gentleman he be sir and quite a different class from them two detective from london what go pry about and ask question i don't hold with foreigner a a rule but from what the newspaper say i make out a how these brave belges isn't the ordinary run of foreigner and certainly he's a most polite speak gentleman dear old dorcas a she stand there with her honest face upturned to mine i think what a fine specimen she be of the <old|former> fashion servant that be so fast die out i think i might a well go down to the <village|settlement> at once and look up poirot but i meet him half way <come|do> up to the house and at once give him dorcas's message ah the brave dorcas we will look at the chest although but no matter we will examine it all the same we enter the <house|mansion> by one of the window there be no <one|i> in the hall and we <go|get> straight up to the attic sure enough there be the chest a fine old piece all stud with brass nail and full to overflow with every <imaginable|conceivable> <type|character> of garment poirot bundle everything out on the <floor|story> with <scant|short> ceremony there be one or two green fabric of vary shade but poirot shake his head over them all he seem somewhat apathetic in the search a though he expect no great result from it suddenly he <give|make> an exclamation what be it look the chest be nearly empty and there repose right at the bottom be a magnificent black beard _oho say poirot _oho he turn it over in his hand examine it closely <new|young> he remark yes quite new after a moment's hesitation he replace it in the chest heap all the other thing on top of it a before and make his way briskly downstairs he go straight to the pantry where we find dorcas busily polish her silver poirot wish her good morning with <gallic|French> politeness and go on we have be look through that chest dorcas i be much oblige to you for mention it there be indeed a fine collection there be they often use may i ask <well|considerably> sir not very often nowadays though from time to time we do have what the young gentleman call 'a dress up night and very funny it be sometimes sir mr lawrence he's wonderful most comic i shall never forget the night he come down a the char of <persia|Islamic_Republic_of_Iran> i think he call it a sort of eastern king it be he have the big paper knife in his hand and 'mind dorcas he say you ll <have|make> to be very respectful this be my specially sharpen scimitar and it's off with your head if i'm at all displease with you <miss|lose> cynthia she be what they call an apache or some such name a frenchify sort of cut throat i take it to be a real sight she look you'd never <have|get> believe a pretty <young|new> lady like that could have make herself into such a ruffian nobody would have know her these even must have be great fun say poirot genially i suppose mr lawrence wear that fine black beard in the chest upstairs when he be shah of persia he do <have|take> a beard sir <reply|respond> dorcas smile and well i know it for he borrow two skein of my black wool to make it with and i'm sure it look wonderfully natural at a distance i didn't know a there be a beard up there at all it must have be get quite lately i <think|remember> there be a red wig i know but <nothing|zero> else in the way of hair burn cork they <use|apply> mostly though 'tis messy get it off again miss <cynthia|Cynthia> <be|follow> a nigger once and oh the trouble she have so dorcas know nothing about that black beard say poirot thoughtfully a we walk out into the hall again do you think it be _the_ one i whisper eagerly poirot nod i <do|come> you notice it have be trim no yes it be cut exactly the shape of mr inglethorp's and i find one or two snip hair hastings this affair be very <deep|inscrutable> who put it in the chest i wonder someone with a good deal of intelligence <remark|observe> poirot dryly you realize that he <choose|take> the one place in the house to <hide|fell> it where it presence would not be remark yes he be intelligent but we must be more intelligent we must be so intelligent that he do not suspect u of be intelligent at all i acquiesce there _mon ami_ you will be of great assistance to me i be please with the compliment there have be time when i hardly think that poirot appreciate me at my true worth yes he continue star at me thoughtfully you will be invaluable this be naturally gratify but poirot's next word be not so welcome i must have an ally in the house he observe reflectively you have me i protest true but you be not sufficient i <be|follow> hurt and show it poirot hurry to explain himself you do not quite take my mean you be know to be work with me i want somebody who be not associate with u in any way oh i see how about john no i think not the dear fellow isn't perhaps very bright i say thoughtfully here come miss howard say poirot suddenly she be the very person but i be in her black book since i clear mr inglethorp still we can but try with a nod that be barely civil miss howard assent to poirot's request for a few minutes' conversation we go into the little morning <room|way> and poirot close the door well monsieur poirot say miss howard impatiently what be it out with it i'm busy <do|make> you remember mademoiselle that i once ask you to help me yes i do the lady nod and i tell you i'd help you with pleasure to <hang|cling> alfred inglethorp ah poirot study her <seriously|earnestly> miss howard i will ask you one question i beg of you to reply to it truthfully never tell lie reply miss howard it be this do you still believe that mr inglethorp be poison by her husband what do you mean she ask sharply you needn't think your pretty <explanation|account> influence me in the slightest i'll admit that it wasn't he who buy strychnine at the chemist's shop what of that i dare say he soak fly paper a i tell you at the begin that be arsenic not strychnine say poirot mildly what do that <matter|affair> arsenic would put poor emily out of the way just a well a strychnine if i'm convince he do it it doesn't matter a jot to me _how_ he do it exactly _if_ you be <convince|convert> he do it say poirot quietly i <will|leave> put my question in another form do you ever in your <heart|nerve> of heart believe that mr inglethorp be poison by her husband good heaven <cry|outcry> miss howard haven't i always <tell|say> you the man be a villain haven't i always tell you he would murder her in her bed haven't i always hat him like poison exactly say poirot that bear out my little idea <entirely|completely> what little <idea|mind> <miss|lose> howard do you remember a conversation that <take|assume> place on the day of my friend's arrival here he repeat it to me and there be a sentence of yours that have impress me very much do you remember affirm that if a crime have be commit and anyone you love have be murder you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the <criminal|crook> be even if you be quite unable to prove it yes i remember say that i believe it too i suppose you think it nonsense not at all and yet you will <pay|give> no <attention|aid> to my instinct against alfred inglethorp no say poirot curtly because your instinct <be|follow> not against mr inglethorp what no you wish to believe he <commit|give> the crime you believe him capable of commit it but your instinct tell you he <do|come> not <commit|give> it it <tell|say> you more shall i go on she be star at him fascinate and make a <slight|little> affirmative movement of the hand shall i <tell|state> you why you have be so vehement against mr inglethorp it be because you <have|get> be try to believe what you wish to believe it be because you be try to drown and stifle your instinct which tell you another name no no no <cry|exclaim> miss howard wildly fling up her hand don't say it oh don't say it it isn't true it can't be true i don't <know|recognize> what put such a wild such a dreadful idea into my head i be <right|powerful> <be|follow> i not ask poirot yes yes you must be a <wizard|mavin> to
