i am inclined to think said i
i should do so sherlock holmes remarked impatiently
i believe that i am one of the most long suffering of mortals but i'll admit that i was annoyed at the sardonic interruption
really holmes said i severely you are a little trying at times
he was too much absorbed with his own thoughts to give any immediate answer to my remonstrance
he leaned upon his hand with his untasted breakfast before him and he stared at the slip of paper which he had just drawn from its envelope
then he took the envelope itself held it up to the light and very carefully studied both the exterior and the flap
it is porlock's writing said he thoughtfully
i can hardly doubt that it is porlock's writing though i have seen it only twice before
the greek e with the peculiar top flourish is distinctive
but if it is porlock then it must be something of the very first importance
he was speaking to himself rather than to me but my vexation disappeared in the interest which the words awakened
who then is porlock
i asked
porlock watson is a nom de plume a mere identification mark but behind it lies a shifty and evasive personality
in a former letter he frankly informed me that the name was not his own and defied me ever to trace him among the teeming millions of this great city
porlock is important not for himself but for the great man with whom he is in touch
picture to yourself the pilot fish with the shark the jackal with the lion anything that is insignificant in companionship with what is formidable not only formidable watson but sinister in the highest degree sinister
that is where he comes within my purview
you have heard me speak of professor moriarty
the famous scientific criminal as famous among crooks as my blushes watson
holmes murmured in a deprecating voice
i was about to say as he is unknown to the public
a touch
a distinct touch
cried holmes
you are developing a certain unexpected vein of pawky humour watson against which i must learn to guard myself
but in calling moriarty a criminal you are uttering libel in the eyes of the law and there lie the glory and the wonder of it
the greatest schemer of all time the organizer of every deviltry the controlling brain of the underworld a brain which might have made or marred the destiny of nations that's the man
but so aloof is he from general suspicion so immune from criticism so admirable in his management and self effacement that for those very words that you have uttered he could hale you to a court and emerge with your year's pension as a solatium for his wounded character
is he not the celebrated author of the dynamics of an asteroid a book which ascends to such rarefied heights of pure mathematics that it is said that there was no man in the scientific press capable of criticizing it
is this a man to traduce
foul mouthed doctor and slandered professor such would be your respective roles
that's genius watson
but if i am spared by lesser men our day will surely come
may i be there to see
i exclaimed devoutly
but you were speaking of this man porlock
ah yes the so called porlock is a link in the chain some little way from its great attachment
porlock is not quite a sound link between ourselves
he is the only flaw in that chain so far as i have been able to test it
but no chain is stronger than its weakest link
exactly my dear watson
hence the extreme importance of porlock
led on by some rudimentary aspirations towards right and encouraged by the judicious stimulation of an occasional ten pound note sent to him by devious methods he has once or twice given me advance information which has been of value that highest value which anticipates and prevents rather than avenges crime
i cannot doubt that if we had the cipher we should find that this communication is of the nature that i indicate
again holmes flattened out the paper upon his unused plate
i rose and leaning over him stared down at the curious inscription which ran as follows c2 douglas birlstone birlstone what do you make of it holmes
it is obviously an attempt to convey secret information
but what is the use of a cipher message without the cipher
in this instance none at all
why do you say 'in this instance'
because there are many ciphers which i would read as easily as i do the apocrypha of the agony column such crude devices amuse the intelligence without fatiguing it
but this is different
it is clearly a reference to the words in a page of some book
until i am told which page and which book i am powerless
but why 'douglas' and 'birlstone'
clearly because those are words which were not contained in the page in question
then why has he not indicated the book
your native shrewdness my dear watson that innate cunning which is the delight of your friends would surely prevent you from inclosing cipher and message in the same envelope
should it miscarry you are undone
as it is both have to go wrong before any harm comes from it
our second post is now overdue and i shall be surprised if it does not bring us either a further letter of explanation or as is more probable the very volume to which these figures refer
holmes's calculation was fulfilled within a very few minutes by the appearance of billy the page with the very letter which we were expecting
the same writing remarked holmes as he opened the envelope and actually signed he added in an exultant voice as he unfolded the epistle
come we are getting on watson
his brow clouded however as he glanced over the contents
dear me this is very disappointing
i fear watson that all our expectations come to nothing
i trust that the man porlock will come to no harm
dear mr
holmes he says i will go no further in this matter
it is too dangerous he suspects me
i can see that he suspects me
he came to me quite unexpectedly after i had actually addressed this envelope with the intention of sending you the key to the cipher
i was able to cover it up
if he had seen it it would have gone hard with me
but i read suspicion in his eyes
please burn the cipher message which can now be of no use to you
fred porlock
holmes sat for some little time twisting this letter between his fingers and frowning as he stared into the fire
after all he said at last there may be nothing in it
it may be only his guilty conscience
knowing himself to be a traitor he may have read the accusation in the other's eyes
the other being i presume professor moriarty
no less
when any of that party talk about 'he' you know whom they mean
there is one predominant 'he' for all of them
but what can he do
hum
that's a large question
when you have one of the first brains of europe up against you and all the powers of darkness at his back there are infinite possibilities
anyhow friend porlock is evidently scared out of his senses kindly compare the writing in the note to that upon its envelope which was done he tells us before this ill omened visit
the one is clear and firm
the other hardly legible
why did he write at all
why did he not simply drop it
because he feared i would make some inquiry after him in that case and possibly bring trouble on him
no doubt said i
of course
i had picked up the original cipher message and was bending my brows over it
it's pretty maddening to think that an important secret may lie here on this slip of paper and that it is beyond human power to penetrate it
sherlock holmes had pushed away his untasted breakfast and lit the unsavoury pipe which was the companion of his deepest meditations
i wonder
said he leaning back and staring at the ceiling
perhaps there are points which have escaped your machiavellian intellect
let us consider the problem in the light of pure reason
this man's reference is to a book
that is our point of departure
a somewhat vague one
let us see then if we can narrow it down
as i focus my mind upon it it seems rather less impenetrable
what indications have we as to this book
none
well well it is surely not quite so bad as that
the cipher message begins with a large does it not
we may take it as a working hypothesis that is the particular page to which the cipher refers
so our book has already become a large book which is surely something gained
what other indications have we as to the nature of this large book
the next sign is c2
what do you make of that watson
chapter the second no doubt
hardly that watson
you will i am sure agree with me that if the page be given the number of the chapter is immaterial
also that if page finds us only in the second chapter the length of the first one must have been really intolerable
column
i cried
brilliant watson
you are scintillating this morning
if it is not column then i am very much deceived
so now you see we begin to visualize a large book printed in double columns which are each of a considerable length since one of the words is numbered in the document as the two hundred and ninety third
have we reached the limits of what reason can supply
i fear that we have
surely you do yourself an injustice
one more coruscation my dear watson yet another brain wave
had the volume been an unusual one he would have sent it to me
instead of that he had intended before his plans were nipped to send me the clue in this envelope
he says so in his note
this would seem to indicate that the book is one which he thought i would have no difficulty in finding for myself
he had it and he imagined that i would have it too
in short watson it is a very common book
what you say certainly sounds plausible
so we have contracted our field of search to a large book printed in double columns and in common use
the bible
i cried triumphantly
good watson good
but not if i may say so quite good enough
even if i accepted the compliment for myself i could hardly name any volume which would be less likely to lie at the elbow of one of moriarty's associates
besides the editions of holy writ are so numerous that he could hardly suppose that two copies would have the same pagination
this is clearly a book which is standardized
he knows for certain that his page will exactly agree with my page
but very few books would correspond with that
exactly
therein lies our salvation
our search is narrowed down to standardized books which anyone may be supposed to possess
bradshaw
there are difficulties watson
the vocabulary of bradshaw is nervous and terse but limited
the selection of words would hardly lend itself to the sending of general messages
we will eliminate bradshaw
the dictionary is i fear inadmissible for the same reason
what then is left
an almanac
excellent watson
i am very much mistaken if you have not touched the spot
an almanac
let us consider the claims of whitaker's almanac
it is in common use
it has the requisite number of pages
it is in double column
though reserved in its earlier vocabulary it becomes if i remember right quite garrulous towards the end
he picked the volume from his desk
here is page column two a substantial block of print dealing i perceive with the trade and resources of british india
jot down the words watson
number thirteen is 'mahratta '
not i fear a very auspicious beginning
number one hundred and twenty seven is 'government' which at least makes sense though somewhat irrelevant to ourselves and professor moriarty
now let us try again
what does the mahratta government do
alas
the next word is 'pig's bristles '
we are undone my good watson
it is finished
he had spoken in jesting vein but the twitching of his bushy eyebrows bespoke his disappointment and irritation
i sat helpless and unhappy staring into the fire
a long silence was broken by a sudden exclamation from holmes who dashed at a cupboard from which he emerged with a second yellow covered volume in his hand
we pay the price watson for being too up to date
he cried
we are before our time and suffer the usual penalties
being the seventh of january we have very properly laid in the new almanac
it is more than likely that porlock took his message from the old one
no doubt he would have told us so had his letter of explanation been written
now let us see what page has in store for us
number thirteen is 'there ' which is much more promising
number one hundred and twenty seven is 'is' 'there is' holmes's eyes were gleaming with excitement and his thin nervous fingers twitched as he counted the words 'danger '
ha
ha
capital
put that down watson
'there is danger may come very soon one '
then we have the name 'douglas' 'rich country now at birlstone house birlstone confidence is pressing '
there watson
what do you think of pure reason and its fruit
if the greengrocer had such a thing as a laurel wreath i should send billy round for it
i was staring at the strange message which i had scrawled as he deciphered it upon a sheet of foolscap on my knee
what a queer scrambling way of expressing his meaning
said i
on the contrary he has done quite remarkably well said holmes
when you search a single column for words with which to express your meaning you can hardly expect to get everything you want
you are bound to leave something to the intelligence of your correspondent
the purport is perfectly clear
some deviltry is intended against one douglas whoever he may be residing as stated a rich country gentleman
he is sure 'confidence' was as near as he could get to 'confident' that it is pressing
there is our result and a very workmanlike little bit of analysis it was
holmes had the impersonal joy of the true artist in his better work even as he mourned darkly when it fell below the high level to which he aspired
he was still chuckling over his success when billy swung open the door and inspector macdonald of scotland yard was ushered into the room
those were the early days at the end of the ' 's when alec macdonald was far from having attained the national fame which he has now achieved
he was a young but trusted member of the detective force who had distinguished himself in several cases which had been entrusted to him
his tall bony figure gave promise of exceptional physical strength while his great cranium and deep set lustrous eyes spoke no less clearly of the keen intelligence which twinkled out from behind his bushy eyebrows
he was a silent precise man with a dour nature and a hard aberdonian accent
twice already in his career had holmes helped him to attain success his own sole reward being the intellectual joy of the problem
for this reason the affection and respect of the scotchman for his amateur colleague were profound and he showed them by the frankness with which he consulted holmes in every difficulty
mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself but talent instantly recognizes genius and macdonald had talent enough for his profession to enable him to perceive that there was no humiliation in seeking the assistance of one who already stood alone in europe both in his gifts and in his experience
holmes was not prone to friendship but he was tolerant of the big scotchman and smiled at the sight of him
you are an early bird mr
mac said he
i wish you luck with your worm
i fear this means that there is some mischief afoot
if you said 'hope' instead of 'fear ' it would be nearer the truth i'm thinking mr
holmes the inspector answered with a knowing grin
well maybe a wee nip would keep out the raw morning chill
no i won't smoke i thank you
i'll have to be pushing on my way for the early hours of a case are the precious ones as no man knows better than your own self
but but the inspector had stopped suddenly and was staring with a look of absolute amazement at a paper upon the table
it was the sheet upon which i had scrawled the enigmatic message
douglas
he stammered
birlstone
what's this mr
holmes
man it's witchcraft
where in the name of all that is wonderful did you get those names
it is a cipher that dr
watson and i have had occasion to solve
but why what's amiss with the names
the inspector looked from one to the other of us in dazed astonishment
just this said he that mr
douglas of birlstone manor house was horribly murdered last night
it was one of those dramatic moments for which my friend existed
it would be an overstatement to say that he was shocked or even excited by the amazing announcement
without having a tinge of cruelty in his singular composition he was undoubtedly callous from long over stimulation
yet if his emotions were dulled his intellectual perceptions were exceedingly active
there was no trace then of the horror which i had myself felt at this curt declaration but his face showed rather the quiet and interested composure of the chemist who sees the crystals falling into position from his oversaturated solution
remarkable
said he
remarkable
you don't seem surprised
interested mr
mac but hardly surprised
why should i be surprised
i receive an anonymous communication from a quarter which i know to be important warning me that danger threatens a certain person
within an hour i learn that this danger has actually materialized and that the person is dead
i am interested but as you observe i am not surprised
in a few short sentences he explained to the inspector the facts about the letter and the cipher
macdonald sat with his chin on his hands and his great sandy eyebrows bunched into a yellow tangle
i was going down to birlstone this morning said he
i had come to ask you if you cared to come with me you and your friend here
but from what you say we might perhaps be doing better work in london
i rather think not said holmes
hang it all mr
holmes
cried the inspector
the papers will be full of the birlstone mystery in a day or two but where's the mystery if there is a man in london who prophesied the crime before ever it occurred
we have only to lay our hands on that man and the rest will follow
no doubt mr
mac
but how do you propose to lay your hands on the so called porlock
macdonald turned over the letter which holmes had handed him
posted in camberwell that doesn't help us much
name you say is assumed
not much to go on certainly
didn't you say that you have sent him money
twice
and how
in notes to camberwell post office
did you ever trouble to see who called for them
no
the inspector looked surprised and a little shocked
why not
because i always keep faith
i had promised when he first wrote that i would not try to trace him
you think there is someone behind him
i know there is
this professor that i've heard you mention
exactly
inspector macdonald smiled and his eyelid quivered as he glanced towards me
i won't conceal from you mr
holmes that we think in the c i d that you have a wee bit of a bee in your bonnet over this professor
i made some inquiries myself about the matter
he seems to be a very respectable learned and talented sort of man
i'm glad you've got so far as to recognize the talent
man you can't but recognize it
after i heard your view i made it my business to see him
i had a chat with him on eclipses
how the talk got that way i canna think but he had out a reflector lantern and a globe and made it all clear in a minute
he lent me a book but i don't mind saying that it was a bit above my head though i had a good aberdeen upbringing
he'd have made a grand meenister with his thin face and gray hair and solemn like way of talking
when he put his hand on my shoulder as we were parting it was like a father's blessing before you go out into the cold cruel world
holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands
great
he said
great
tell me friend macdonald this pleasing and touching interview was i suppose in the professor's study
that's so
a fine room is it not
very fine very handsome indeed mr
holmes
you sat in front of his writing desk
just so
sun in your eyes and his face in the shadow
well it was evening but i mind that the lamp was turned on my face
it would be
did you happen to observe a picture over the professor's head
i don't miss much mr
holmes
maybe i learned that from you
yes i saw the picture a young woman with her head on her hands peeping at you sideways
that painting was by jean baptiste greuze
the inspector endeavoured to look interested
jean baptiste greuze holmes continued joining his finger tips and leaning well back in his chair was a french artist who flourished between the years and
i allude of course to his working career
modern criticism has more than indorsed the high opinion formed of him by his contemporaries
the inspector's eyes grew abstracted
hadn't we better he said
we are doing so holmes interrupted
all that i am saying has a very direct and vital bearing upon what you have called the birlstone mystery
in fact it may in a sense be called the very centre of it
macdonald smiled feebly and looked appealingly to me
your thoughts move a bit too quick for me mr
holmes
you leave out a link or two and i can't get over the gap
what in the whole wide world can be the connection between this dead painting man and the affair at birlstone
all knowledge comes useful to the detective remarked holmes
even the trivial fact that in the year a picture by greuze entitled la jeune fille a l'agneau fetched one million two hundred thousand francs more than forty thousand pounds at the portalis sale may start a train of reflection in your mind
it was clear that it did
the inspector looked honestly interested
i may remind you holmes continued that the professor's salary can be ascertained in several trustworthy books of reference
it is seven hundred a year
then how could he buy quite so
how could he
ay that's remarkable said the inspector thoughtfully
talk away mr
holmes
i'm just loving it
it's fine
holmes smiled
he was always warmed by genuine admiration the characteristic of the real artist
what about birlstone
he asked
we've time yet said the inspector glancing at his watch
i've a cab at the door and it won't take us twenty minutes to victoria
but about this picture i thought you told me once mr
holmes that you had never met professor moriarty
no i never have
then how do you know about his rooms
ah that's another matter
i have been three times in his rooms twice waiting for him under different pretexts and leaving before he came
once well i can hardly tell about the once to an official detective
it was on the last occasion that i took the liberty of running over his papers with the most unexpected results
you found something compromising
absolutely nothing
that was what amazed me
however you have now seen the point of the picture
it shows him to be a very wealthy man
how did he acquire wealth
he is unmarried
his younger brother is a station master in the west of england
his chair is worth seven hundred a year
and he owns a greuze
well
surely the inference is plain
you mean that he has a great income and that he must earn it in an illegal fashion
exactly
of course i have other reasons for thinking so dozens of exiguous threads which lead vaguely up towards the centre of the web where the poisonous motionless creature is lurking
i only mention the greuze because it brings the matter within the range of your own observation
well mr
holmes i admit that what you say is interesting it's more than interesting it's just wonderful
but let us have it a little clearer if you can
is it forgery coining burglary where does the money come from
have you ever read of jonathan wild
well the name has a familiar sound
someone in a novel was he not
i don't take much stock of detectives in novels chaps that do things and never let you see how they do them
that's just inspiration not business
jonathan wild wasn't a detective and he wasn't in a novel
he was a master criminal and he lived last century or thereabouts
then he's no use to me
i'm a practical man
mr
mac the most practical thing that you ever did in your life would be to shut yourself up for three months and read twelve hours a day at the annals of crime
everything comes in circles even professor moriarty
jonathan wild was the hidden force of the london criminals to whom he sold his brains and his organization on a fifteen per cent commission
the old wheel turns and the same spoke comes up
it's all been done before and will be again
i'll tell you one or two things about moriarty which may interest you
you'll interest me right enough
i happen to know who is the first link in his chain a chain with this napoleon gone wrong at one end and a hundred broken fighting men pickpockets blackmailers and card sharpers at the other with every sort of crime in between
his chief of staff is colonel sebastian moran as aloof and guarded and inaccessible to the law as himself
what do you think he pays him
i'd like to hear
six thousand a year
that's paying for brains you see the american business principle
i learned that detail quite by chance
it's more than the prime minister gets
that gives you an idea of moriarty's gains and of the scale on which he works
another point i made it my business to hunt down some of moriarty's checks lately just common innocent checks that he pays his household bills with
they were drawn on six different banks
does that make any impression on your mind
queer certainly
but what do you gather from it
that he wanted no gossip about his wealth
no single man should know what he had
i have no doubt that he has twenty banking accounts the bulk of his fortune abroad in the deutsche bank or the credit lyonnais as likely as not
sometime when you have a year or two to spare i commend to you the study of professor moriarty
inspector macdonald had grown steadily more impressed as the conversation proceeded
he had lost himself in his interest
now his practical scotch intelligence brought him back with a snap to the matter in hand
he can keep anyhow said he
you've got us side tracked with your interesting anecdotes mr
holmes
what really counts is your remark that there is some connection between the professor and the crime
that you get from the warning received through the man porlock
can we for our present practical needs get any further than that
we may form some conception as to the motives of the crime
it is as i gather from your original remarks an inexplicable or at least an unexplained murder
now presuming that the source of the crime is as we suspect it to be there might be two different motives
in the first place i may tell you that moriarty rules with a rod of iron over his people
his discipline is tremendous
there is only one punishment in his code
it is death
now we might suppose that this murdered man this douglas whose approaching fate was known by one of the arch criminal's subordinates had in some way betrayed the chief
his punishment followed and would be known to all if only to put the fear of death into them
well that is one suggestion mr
holmes
the other is that it has been engineered by moriarty in the ordinary course of business
was there any robbery
i have not heard
if so it would of course be against the first hypothesis and in favour of the second
moriarty may have been engaged to engineer it on a promise of part spoils or he may have been paid so much down to manage it
either is possible
but whichever it may be or if it is some third combination it is down at birlstone that we must seek the solution
i know our man too well to suppose that he has left anything up here which may lead us to him
then to birlstone we must go
cried macdonald jumping from his chair
my word
it's later than i thought
i can give you gentlemen five minutes for preparation and that is all
and ample for us both said holmes as he sprang up and hastened to change from his dressing gown to his coat
while we are on our way mr
mac i will ask you to be good enough to tell me all about it
all about it proved to be disappointingly little and yet there was enough to assure us that the case before us might well be worthy of the expert's closest attention
he brightened and rubbed his thin hands together as he listened to the meagre but remarkable details
a long series of sterile weeks lay behind us and here at last there was a fitting object for those remarkable powers which like all special gifts become irksome to their owner when they are not in use
that razor brain blunted and rusted with inaction
sherlock holmes's eyes glistened his pale cheeks took a warmer hue and his whole eager face shone with an inward light when the call for work reached him
leaning forward in the cab he listened intently to macdonald's short sketch of the problem which awaited us in sussex
the inspector was himself dependent as he explained to us upon a scribbled account forwarded to him by the milk train in the early hours of the morning
white mason the local officer was a personal friend and hence macdonald had been notified much more promptly than is usual at scotland yard when provincials need their assistance
it is a very cold scent upon which the metropolitan expert is generally asked to run
dear inspector macdonald said the letter which he read to us official requisition for your services is in separate envelope
this is for your private eye
wire me what train in the morning you can get for birlstone and i will meet it or have it met if i am too occupied
this case is a snorter
don't waste a moment in getting started
if you can bring mr
holmes please do so for he will find something after his own heart
we would think the whole thing had been fixed up for theatrical effect if there wasn't a dead man in the middle of it
my word
it is a snorter
your friend seems to be no fool remarked holmes
no sir white mason is a very live man if i am any judge
well have you anything more
only that he will give us every detail when we meet
then how did you get at mr
douglas and the fact that he had been horribly murdered
that was in the enclosed official report
it didn't say 'horrible' that's not a recognized official term
it gave the name john douglas
it mentioned that his injuries had been in the head from the discharge of a shotgun
it also mentioned the hour of the alarm which was close on to midnight last night
it added that the case was undoubtedly one of murder but that no arrest had been made and that the case was one which presented some very perplexing and extraordinary features
that's absolutely all we have at present mr
holmes
then with your permission we will leave it at that mr
mac
the temptation to form premature theories upon insufficient data is the bane of our profession
i can see only two things for certain at present a great brain in london and a dead man in sussex
it's the chain between that we are going to trace
now for a moment i will ask leave to remove my own insignificant personality and to describe events which occurred before we arrived upon the scene by the light of knowledge which came to us afterwards
only in this way can i make the reader appreciate the people concerned and the strange setting in which their fate was cast
the village of birlstone is a small and very ancient cluster of half timbered cottages on the northern border of the county of sussex
for centuries it had remained unchanged but within the last few years its picturesque appearance and situation have attracted a number of well to do residents whose villas peep out from the woods around
these woods are locally supposed to be the extreme fringe of the great weald forest which thins away until it reaches the northern chalk downs
a number of small shops have come into being to meet the wants of the increased population so there seems some prospect that birlstone may soon grow from an ancient village into a modern town
it is the centre for a considerable area of country since tunbridge wells the nearest place of importance is ten or twelve miles to the eastward over the borders of kent
about half a mile from the town standing in an old park famous for its huge beech trees is the ancient manor house of birlstone
part of this venerable building dates back to the time of the first crusade when hugo de capus built a fortalice in the centre of the estate which had been granted to him by the red king
this was destroyed by fire in and some of its smoke blackened corner stones were used when in jacobean times a brick country house rose upon the ruins of the feudal castle
the manor house with its many gables and its small diamond paned windows was still much as the builder had left it in the early seventeenth century
of the double moats which had guarded its more warlike predecessor the outer had been allowed to dry up and served the humble function of a kitchen garden
the inner one was still there and lay forty feet in breadth though now only a few feet in depth round the whole house
a small stream fed it and continued beyond it so that the sheet of water though turbid was never ditch like or unhealthy
the ground floor windows were within a foot of the surface of the water
the only approach to the house was over a drawbridge the chains and windlass of which had long been rusted and broken
the latest tenants of the manor house had however with characteristic energy set this right and the drawbridge was not only capable of being raised but actually was raised every evening and lowered every morning
by thus renewing the custom of the old feudal days the manor house was converted into an island during the night a fact which had a very direct bearing upon the mystery which was soon to engage the attention of all england
the house had been untenanted for some years and was threatening to moulder into a picturesque decay when the douglases took possession of it
this family consisted of only two individuals john douglas and his wife
douglas was a remarkable man both in character and in person
in age he may have been about fifty with a strong jawed rugged face a grizzling moustache peculiarly keen gray eyes and a wiry vigorous figure which had lost nothing of the strength and activity of youth
he was cheery and genial to all but somewhat offhand in his manners giving the impression that he had seen life in social strata on some far lower horizon than the county society of sussex
yet though looked at with some curiosity and reserve by his more cultivated neighbours he soon acquired a great popularity among the villagers subscribing handsomely to all local objects and attending their smoking concerts and other functions where having a remarkably rich tenor voice he was always ready to oblige with an excellent song
he appeared to have plenty of money which was said to have been gained in the california gold fields and it was clear from his own talk and that of his wife that he had spent a part of his life in america
the good impression which had been produced by his generosity and by his democratic manners was increased by a reputation gained for utter indifference to danger
though a wretched rider he turned out at every meet and took the most amazing falls in his determination to hold his own with the best
when the vicarage caught fire he distinguished himself also by the fearlessness with which he reentered the building to save property after the local fire brigade had given it up as impossible
thus it came about that john douglas of the manor house had within five years won himself quite a reputation in birlstone
his wife too was popular with those who had made her acquaintance though after the english fashion the callers upon a stranger who settled in the county without introductions were few and far between
this mattered the less to her as she was retiring by disposition and very much absorbed to all appearance in her husband and her domestic duties
it was known that she was an english lady who had met mr
douglas in london he being at that time a widower
she was a beautiful woman tall dark and slender some twenty years younger than her husband a disparity which seemed in no wise to mar the contentment of their family life
it was remarked sometimes however by those who knew them best that the confidence between the two did not appear to be complete since the wife was either very reticent about her husband's past life or else as seemed more likely was imperfectly informed about it
it had also been noted and commented upon by a few observant people that there were signs sometimes of some nerve strain upon the part of mrs
douglas and that she would display acute uneasiness if her absent husband should ever be particularly late in his return
on a quiet countryside where all gossip is welcome this weakness of the lady of the manor house did not pass without remark and it bulked larger upon people's memory when the events arose which gave it a very special significance
there was yet another individual whose residence under that roof was it is true only an intermittent one but whose presence at the time of the strange happenings which will now be narrated brought his name prominently before the public
this was cecil james barker of hales lodge hampstead
cecil barker's tall loose jointed figure was a familiar one in the main street of birlstone village for he was a frequent and welcome visitor at the manor house
he was the more noticed as being the only friend of the past unknown life of mr
douglas who was ever seen in his new english surroundings
barker was himself an undoubted englishman but by his remarks it was clear that he had first known douglas in america and had there lived on intimate terms with him
he appeared to be a man of considerable wealth and was reputed to be a bachelor
in age he was rather younger than douglas forty five at the most a tall straight broad chested fellow with a clean shaved prize fighter face thick strong black eyebrows and a pair of masterful black eyes which might even without the aid of his very capable hands clear a way for him through a hostile crowd
he neither rode nor shot but spent his days in wandering round the old village with his pipe in his mouth or in driving with his host or in his absence with his hostess over the beautiful countryside
an easy going free handed gentleman said ames the butler
but my word
i had rather not be the man that crossed him
he was cordial and intimate with douglas and he was no less friendly with his wife a friendship which more than once seemed to cause some irritation to the husband so that even the servants were able to perceive his annoyance
such was the third person who was one of the family when the catastrophe occurred
as to the other denizens of the old building it will suffice out of a large household to mention the prim respectable and capable ames and mrs
allen a buxom and cheerful person who relieved the lady of some of her household cares
the other six servants in the house bear no relation to the events of the night of january 6th
it was at eleven forty five that the first alarm reached the small local police station in charge of sergeant wilson of the sussex constabulary
cecil barker much excited had rushed up to the door and pealed furiously upon the bell
a terrible tragedy had occurred at the manor house and john douglas had been murdered
that was the breathless burden of his message
he had hurried back to the house followed within a few minutes by the police sergeant who arrived at the scene of the crime a little after twelve o'clock after taking prompt steps to warn the county authorities that something serious was afoot
on reaching the manor house the sergeant had found the drawbridge down the windows lighted up and the whole household in a state of wild confusion and alarm
the white faced servants were huddling together in the hall with the frightened butler wringing his hands in the doorway
only cecil barker seemed to be master of himself and his emotions he had opened the door which was nearest to the entrance and he had beckoned to the sergeant to follow him
at that moment there arrived dr
wood a brisk and capable general practitioner from the village
the three men entered the fatal room together while the horror stricken butler followed at their heels closing the door behind him to shut out the terrible scene from the maid servants
the dead man lay on his back sprawling with outstretched limbs in the centre of the room
he was clad only in a pink dressing gown which covered his night clothes
there were carpet slippers on his bare feet
the doctor knelt beside him and held down the hand lamp which had stood on the table
one glance at the victim was enough to show the healer that his presence could be dispensed with
the man had been horribly injured
lying across his chest was a curious weapon a shotgun with the barrel sawed off a foot in front of the triggers
it was clear that this had been fired at close range and that he had received the whole charge in the face blowing his head almost to pieces
the triggers had been wired together so as to make the simultaneous discharge more destructive
the country policeman was unnerved and troubled by the tremendous responsibility which had come so suddenly upon him
we will touch nothing until my superiors arrive he said in a hushed voice staring in horror at the dreadful head
nothing has been touched up to now said cecil barker
i'll answer for that
you see it all exactly as i found it
when was that
the sergeant had drawn out his notebook
it was just half past eleven
i had not begun to undress and i was sitting by the fire in my bedroom when i heard the report
it was not very loud it seemed to be muffled
i rushed down i don't suppose it was thirty seconds before i was in the room
was the door open
yes it was open
poor douglas was lying as you see him
his bedroom candle was burning on the table
it was i who lit the lamp some minutes afterward
did you see no one
no
i heard mrs
douglas coming down the stair behind me and i rushed out to prevent her from seeing this dreadful sight
mrs
allen the housekeeper came and took her away
ames had arrived and we ran back into the room once more
but surely i have heard that the drawbridge is kept up all night
yes it was up until i lowered it
then how could any murderer have got away
it is out of the question
mr
douglas must have shot himself
that was our first idea
but see
barker drew aside the curtain and showed that the long diamond paned window was open to its full extent
and look at this
he held the lamp down and illuminated a smudge of blood like the mark of a boot sole upon the wooden sill
someone has stood there in getting out
you mean that someone waded across the moat
exactly
then if you were in the room within half a minute of the crime he must have been in the water at that very moment
i have not a doubt of it
i wish to heaven that i had rushed to the window
but the curtain screened it as you can see and so it never occurred to me
then i heard the step of mrs
douglas and i could not let her enter the room
it would have been too horrible
horrible enough
said the doctor looking at the shattered head and the terrible marks which surrounded it
i've never seen such injuries since the birlstone railway smash
but i say remarked the police sergeant whose slow bucolic common sense was still pondering the open window
it's all very well your saying that a man escaped by wading this moat but what i ask you is how did he ever get into the house at all if the bridge was up
ah that's the question said barker
at what o'clock was it raised
it was nearly six o'clock said ames the butler
i've heard said the sergeant that it was usually raised at sunset
that would be nearer half past four than six at this time of year
mrs
douglas had visitors to tea said ames
i couldn't raise it until they went
then i wound it up myself
then it comes to this said the sergeant if anyone came from outside if they did they must have got in across the bridge before six and been in hiding ever since until mr
douglas came into the room after eleven
that is so
mr
douglas went round the house every night the last thing before he turned in to see that the lights were right
that brought him in here
the man was waiting and shot him
then he got away through the window and left his gun behind him
that's how i read it for nothing else will fit the facts
the sergeant picked up a card which lay beside the dead man on the floor
the initials v v and under them the number were rudely scrawled in ink upon it
what's this
he asked holding it up
barker looked at it with curiosity
i never noticed it before he said
the murderer must have left it behind him
v
v
i can make no sense of that
the sergeant kept turning it over in his big fingers
what's v v
somebody's initials maybe
what have you got there dr
wood
it was a good sized hammer which had been lying on the rug in front of the fireplace a substantial workmanlike hammer
cecil barker pointed to a box of brass headed nails upon the mantelpiece
mr
douglas was altering the pictures yesterday he said
i saw him myself standing upon that chair and fixing the big picture above it
that accounts for the hammer
we'd best put it back on the rug where we found it said the sergeant scratching his puzzled head in his perplexity
it will want the best brains in the force to get to the bottom of this thing
it will be a london job before it is finished
he raised the hand lamp and walked slowly round the room
hullo
he cried excitedly drawing the window curtain to one side
what o'clock were those curtains drawn
when the lamps were lit said the butler
it would be shortly after four
someone had been hiding here sure enough
he held down the light and the marks of muddy boots were very visible in the corner
i'm bound to say this bears out your theory mr
barker
it looks as if the man got into the house after four when the curtains were drawn and before six when the bridge was raised
he slipped into this room because it was the first that he saw
there was no other place where he could hide so he popped in behind this curtain
that all seems clear enough
it is likely that his main idea was to burgle the house but mr
douglas chanced to come upon him so he murdered him and escaped
that's how i read it said barker
but i say aren't we wasting precious time
couldn't we start out and scour the country before the fellow gets away
the sergeant considered for a moment
there are no trains before six in the morning so he can't get away by rail
if he goes by road with his legs all dripping it's odds that someone will notice him
anyhow i can't leave here myself until i am relieved
but i think none of you should go until we see more clearly how we all stand
the doctor had taken the lamp and was narrowly scrutinizing the body
what's this mark
he asked
could this have any connection with the crime
the dead man's right arm was thrust out from his dressing gown and exposed as high as the elbow
about halfway up the forearm was a curious brown design a triangle inside a circle standing out in vivid relief upon the lard coloured skin
it's not tattooed said the doctor peering through his glasses
i never saw anything like it
the man has been branded at some time as they brand cattle
what is the meaning of this
i don't profess to know the meaning of it said cecil barker but i have seen the mark on douglas many times this last ten years
and so have i said the butler
many a time when the master has rolled up his sleeves i have noticed that very mark
i've often wondered what it could be
then it has nothing to do with the crime anyhow said the sergeant
but it's a rum thing all the same
everything about this case is rum
well what is it now
the butler had given an exclamation of astonishment and was pointing at the dead man's outstretched hand
they've taken his wedding ring
he gasped
what
yes indeed
master always wore his plain gold wedding ring on the little finger of his left hand
that ring with the rough nugget on it was above it and the twisted snake ring on the third finger
there's the nugget and there's the snake but the wedding ring is gone
he's right said barker
do you tell me said the sergeant that the wedding ring was below the other
always
then the murderer or whoever it was first took off this ring you call the nugget ring then the wedding ring and afterwards put the nugget ring back again
that is so
the worthy country policeman shook his head
seems to me the sooner we get london on to this case the better said he
white mason is a smart man
no local job has ever been too much for white mason
it won't be long now before he is here to help us
but i expect we'll have to look to london before we are through
anyhow i'm not ashamed to say that it is a deal too thick for the likes of me
at three in the morning the chief sussex detective obeying the urgent call from sergeant wilson of birlstone arrived from headquarters in a light dog cart behind a breathless trotter
by the five forty train in the morning he had sent his message to scotland yard and he was at the birlstone station at twelve o'clock to welcome us
white mason was a quiet comfortable looking person in a loose tweed suit with a clean shaved ruddy face a stoutish body and powerful bandy legs adorned with gaiters looking like a small farmer a retired gamekeeper or anything upon earth except a very favourable specimen of the provincial criminal officer
a real downright snorter mr
macdonald
he kept repeating
we'll have the pressmen down like flies when they understand it
i'm hoping we will get our work done before they get poking their noses into it and messing up all the trails
there has been nothing like this that i can remember
there are some bits that will come home to you mr
holmes or i am mistaken
and you also dr
watson for the medicos will have a word to say before we finish
your room is at the westville arms
there's no other place but i hear that it is clean and good
the man will carry your bags
this way gentlemen if you please
he was a very bustling and genial person this sussex detective
in ten minutes we had all found our quarters
in ten more we were seated in the parlour of the inn and being treated to a rapid sketch of those events which have been outlined in the previous chapter
macdonald made an occasional note while holmes sat absorbed with the expression of surprised and reverent admiration with which the botanist surveys the rare and precious bloom
remarkable
he said when the story was unfolded most remarkable
i can hardly recall any case where the features have been more peculiar
i thought you would say so mr
holmes said white mason in great delight
we're well up with the times in sussex
i've told you now how matters were up to the time when i took over from sergeant wilson between three and four this morning
my word
i made the old mare go
but i need not have been in such a hurry as it turned out for there was nothing immediate that i could do
sergeant wilson had all the facts
i checked them and considered them and maybe added a few of my own
what were they
asked holmes eagerly
well i first had the hammer examined
there was dr
wood there to help me
we found no signs of violence upon it
i was hoping that if mr
douglas defended himself with the hammer he might have left his mark upon the murderer before he dropped it on the mat
but there was no stain
that of course proves nothing at all remarked inspector macdonald
there has been many a hammer murder and no trace on the hammer
quite so
it doesn't prove it wasn't used
but there might have been stains and that would have helped us
as a matter of fact there were none
then i examined the gun
they were buckshot cartridges and as sergeant wilson pointed out the triggers were wired together so that if you pulled on the hinder one both barrels were discharged
whoever fixed that up had made up his mind that he was going to take no chances of missing his man
the sawed gun was not more than two foot long one could carry it easily under one's coat
there was no complete maker's name but the printed letters p e n were on the fluting between the barrels and the rest of the name had been cut off by the saw
a big p with a flourish above it e and n smaller
asked holmes
exactly
pennsylvania small arms company well known american firm said holmes
white mason gazed at my friend as the little village practitioner looks at the harley street specialist who by a word can solve the difficulties that perplex him
that is very helpful mr
holmes
no doubt you are right
wonderful
wonderful
do you carry the names of all the gun makers in the world in your memory
holmes dismissed the subject with a wave
no doubt it is an american shotgun white mason continued
i seem to have read that a sawed off shotgun is a weapon used in some parts of america
apart from the name upon the barrel the idea had occurred to me
there is some evidence then that this man who entered the house and killed its master was an american
macdonald shook his head
man you are surely travelling overfast said he
i have heard no evidence yet that any stranger was ever in the house at all
the open window the blood on the sill the queer card the marks of boots in the corner the gun
nothing there that could not have been arranged
mr
douglas was an american or had lived long in america
so had mr
barker
you don't need to import an american from outside in order to account for american doings
ames the butler what about him
is he reliable
ten years with sir charles chandos as solid as a rock
he has been with douglas ever since he took the manor house five years ago
he has never seen a gun of this sort in the house
the gun was made to conceal
that's why the barrels were sawed
it would fit into any box
how could he swear there was no such gun in the house
well anyhow he had never seen one
macdonald shook his obstinate scotch head
i'm not convinced yet that there was ever anyone in the house said he
i'm asking you to conseedar his accent became more aberdonian as he lost himself in his argument i'm asking you to conseedar what it involves if you suppose that this gun was ever brought into the house and that all these strange things were done by a person from outside
oh man it's just inconceivable
it's clean against common sense
i put it to you mr
holmes judging it by what we have heard
well state your case mr
mac said holmes in his most judicial style
the man is not a burglar supposing that he ever existed
the ring business and the card point to premeditated murder for some private reason
very good
here is a man who slips into a house with the deliberate intention of committing murder
he knows if he knows anything that he will have a deeficulty in making his escape as the house is surrounded with water
what weapon would he choose
you would say the most silent in the world
then he could hope when the deed was done to slip quickly from the window to wade the moat and to get away at his leisure
that's understandable
but is it understandable that he should go out of his way to bring with him the most noisy weapon he could select knowing well that it will fetch every human being in the house to the spot as quick as they can run and that it is all odds that he will be seen before he can get across the moat
is that credible mr
holmes
well you put the case strongly my friend replied thoughtfully
it certainly needs a good deal of justification
may i ask mr
white mason whether you examined the farther side of the moat at once to see if there were any signs of the man having climbed out from the water
there were no signs mr
holmes
but it is a stone ledge and one could hardly expect them
no tracks or marks
none
ha
would there be any objection mr
white mason to our going down to the house at once
there may possibly be some small point which might be suggestive
i was going to propose it mr
holmes but i thought it well to put you in touch with all the facts before we go
i suppose if anything should strike you white mason looked doubtfully at the amateur
i have worked with mr
holmes before said inspector macdonald
he plays the game
my own idea of the game at any rate said holmes with a smile
i go into a case to help the ends of justice and the work of the police
if i have ever separated myself from the official force it is because they have first separated themselves from me
i have no wish ever to score at their expense
at the same time mr
white mason i claim the right to work in my own way and give my results at my own time complete rather than in stages
i am sure we are honoured by your presence and to show you all we know said white mason cordially
come along dr
watson and when the time comes we'll all hope for a place in your book
we walked down the quaint village street with a row of pollarded elms on each side of it
just beyond were two ancient stone pillars weather stained and lichen blotched bearing upon their summits a shapeless something which had once been the rampant lion of capus of birlstone
a short walk along the winding drive with such sward and oaks around it as one only sees in rural england then a sudden turn and the long low jacobean house of dingy liver coloured brick lay before us with an old fashioned garden of cut yews on each side of it
as we approached it there was the wooden drawbridge and the beautiful broad moat as still and luminous as quicksilver in the cold winter sunshine
three centuries had flowed past the old manor house centuries of births and of homecomings of country dances and of the meetings of fox hunters
strange that now in its old age this dark business should have cast its shadow upon the venerable walls
and yet those strange peaked roofs and quaint overhung gables were a fitting covering to grim and terrible intrigue
as i looked at the deep set windows and the long sweep of the dull coloured water lapped front i felt that no more fitting scene could be set for such a tragedy
that's the window said white mason that one on the immediate right of the drawbridge
it's open just as it was found last night
it looks rather narrow for a man to pass
well it wasn't a fat man anyhow
we don't need your deductions mr
holmes to tell us that
but you or i could squeeze through all right
holmes walked to the edge of the moat and looked across
then he examined the stone ledge and the grass border beyond it
i've had a good look mr
holmes said white mason
there is nothing there no sign that anyone has landed but why should he leave any sign
exactly
why should he
is the water always turbid
generally about this colour
the stream brings down the clay
how deep is it
about two feet at each side and three in the middle
so we can put aside all idea of the man having been drowned in crossing
no a child could not be drowned in it
we walked across the drawbridge and were admitted by a quaint gnarled dried up person who was the butler ames
the poor old fellow was white and quivering from the shock
the village sergeant a tall formal melancholy man still held his vigil in the room of fate
the doctor had departed
anything fresh sergeant wilson
asked white mason
no sir
then you can go home
you've had enough
we can send for you if we want you
the butler had better wait outside
tell him to warn mr
cecil barker mrs
douglas and the housekeeper that we may want a word with them presently
now gentlemen perhaps you will allow me to give you the views i have formed first and then you will be able to arrive at your own
he impressed me this country specialist
he had a solid grip of fact and a cool clear common sense brain which should take him some way in his profession
holmes listened to him intently with no sign of that impatience which the official exponent too often produced
is it suicide or is it murder that's our first question gentlemen is it not
if it were suicide then we have to believe that this man began by taking off his wedding ring and concealing it that he then came down here in his dressing gown trampled mud into a corner behind the curtain in order to give the idea someone had waited for him opened the window put blood on the we can surely dismiss that said macdonald
so i think
suicide is out of the question
then a murder has been done
what we have to determine is whether it was done by someone outside or inside the house
well let's hear the argument
there are considerable difficulties both ways and yet one or the other it must be
we will suppose first that some person or persons inside the house did the crime
they got this man down here at a time when everything was still and yet no one was asleep
they then did the deed with the queerest and noisiest weapon in the world so as to tell everyone what had happened a weapon that was never seen in the house before
that does not seem a very likely start does it
no it does not
well then everyone is agreed that after the alarm was given only a minute at the most had passed before the whole household not mr
cecil barker alone though he claims to have been the first but ames and all of them were on the spot
do you tell me that in that time the guilty person managed to make footmarks in the corner open the window mark the sill with blood take the wedding ring off the dead man's finger and all the rest of it
it's impossible
you put it very clearly said holmes
i am inclined to agree with you
well then we are driven back to the theory that it was done by someone from outside
we are still faced with some big difficulties but anyhow they have ceased to be impossibilities
the man got into the house between four thirty and six that is to say between dusk and the time when the bridge was raised
there had been some visitors and the door was open so there was nothing to prevent him
he may have been a common burglar or he may have had some private grudge against mr
douglas
since mr
douglas has spent most of his life in america and this shotgun seems to be an american weapon it would seem that the private grudge is the more likely theory
he slipped into this room because it was the first he came to and he hid behind the curtain
there he remained until past eleven at night
at that time mr
douglas entered the room
it was a short interview if there were any interview at all for mrs
douglas declares that her husband had not left her more than a few minutes when she heard the shot
the candle shows that said holmes
exactly
the candle which was a new one is not burned more than half an inch
he must have placed it on the table before he was attacked otherwise of course it would have fallen when he fell
this shows that he was not attacked the instant that he entered the room
when mr
barker arrived the candle was lit and the lamp was out
that's all clear enough
well now we can reconstruct things on those lines
mr
douglas enters the room
he puts down the candle
a man appears from behind the curtain
he is armed with this gun
he demands the wedding ring heaven only knows why but so it must have been
mr
douglas gave it up
then either in cold blood or in the course of a struggle douglas may have gripped the hammer that was found upon the mat he shot douglas in this horrible way
he dropped his gun and also it would seem this queer card v v
whatever that may mean and he made his escape through the window and across the moat at the very moment when cecil barker was discovering the crime
how's that mr
holmes
very interesting but just a little unconvincing
man it would be absolute nonsense if it wasn't that anything else is even worse
cried macdonald
somebody killed the man and whoever it was i could clearly prove to you that he should have done it some other way
what does he mean by allowing his retreat to be cut off like that
what does he mean by using a shotgun when silence was his one chance of escape
come mr
holmes it's up to you to give us a lead since you say mr
white mason's theory is unconvincing
holmes had sat intently observant during this long discussion missing no word that was said with his keen eyes darting to right and to left and his forehead wrinkled with speculation
i should like a few more facts before i get so far as a theory mr
mac said he kneeling down beside the body
dear me
these injuries are really appalling
can we have the butler in for a moment



ames i understand that you have often seen this very unusual mark a branded triangle inside a circle upon mr
douglas's forearm
frequently sir
you never heard any speculation as to what it meant
no sir
it must have caused great pain when it was inflicted
it is undoubtedly a burn
now i observe ames that there is a small piece of plaster at the angle of mr
douglas's jaw
did you observe that in life
yes sir he cut himself in shaving yesterday morning
did you ever know him to cut himself in shaving before
not for a very long time sir
suggestive
said holmes
it may of course be a mere coincidence or it may point to some nervousness which would indicate that he had reason to apprehend danger
had you noticed anything unusual in his conduct yesterday ames
it struck me that he was a little restless and excited sir
ha
the attack may not have been entirely unexpected
we do seem to make a little progress do we not
perhaps you would rather do the questioning mr
mac
no mr
holmes it's in better hands than mine
well then we will pass to this card v v

it is rough cardboard
have you any of the sort in the house
i don't think so
holmes walked across to the desk and dabbed a little ink from each bottle on to the blotting paper
it was not printed in this room he said this is black ink and the other purplish
it was done by a thick pen and these are fine
no it was done elsewhere i should say
can you make anything of the inscription ames
no sir nothing
what do you think mr
mac
it gives me the impression of a secret society of some sort the same with his badge upon the forearm
that's my idea too said white mason
well we can adopt it as a working hypothesis and then see how far our difficulties disappear
an agent from such a society makes his way into the house waits for mr
douglas blows his head nearly off with this weapon and escapes by wading the moat after leaving a card beside the dead man which will when mentioned in the papers tell other members of the society that vengeance has been done
that all hangs together
but why this gun of all weapons
exactly
and why the missing ring
quite so
and why no arrest
it's past two now
i take it for granted that since dawn every constable within forty miles has been looking out for a wet stranger
that is so mr
holmes
well unless he has a burrow close by or a change of clothes ready they can hardly miss him
and yet they have missed him up to now
holmes had gone to the window and was examining with his lens the blood mark on the sill
it is clearly the tread of a shoe
it is remarkably broad a splay foot one would say
curious because so far as one can trace any footmark in this mud stained corner one would say it was a more shapely sole
however they are certainly very indistinct
what's this under the side table
mr
douglas's dumb bells said ames
dumb bell there's only one
where's the other
i don't know mr
holmes
there may have been only one
i have not noticed them for months
one dumb bell holmes said seriously but his remarks were interrupted by a sharp knock at the door
a tall sunburned capable looking clean shaved man looked in at us
i had no difficulty in guessing that it was the cecil barker of whom i had heard
his masterful eyes travelled quickly with a questioning glance from face to face
sorry to interrupt your consultation said he but you should hear the latest news
an arrest
no such luck
but they've found his bicycle
the fellow left his bicycle behind him
come and have a look
it is within a hundred yards of the hall door
we found three or four grooms and idlers standing in the drive inspecting a bicycle which had been drawn out from a clump of evergreens in which it had been concealed
it was a well used rudge whitworth splashed as from a considerable journey
there was a saddlebag with spanner and oilcan but no clue as to the owner
it would be a grand help to the police said the inspector if these things were numbered and registered
but we must be thankful for what we've got
if we can't find where he went to at least we are likely to get where he came from
but what in the name of all that is wonderful made the fellow leave it behind
and how in the world has he got away without it
we don't seem to get a gleam of light in the case mr
holmes
don't we
my friend answered thoughtfully
i wonder
have you seen all you want of the study
asked white mason as we reentered the house
for the time said the inspector and holmes nodded
then perhaps you would now like to hear the evidence of some of the people in the house
we could use the dining room ames
please come yourself first and tell us what you know
the butler's account was a simple and a clear one and he gave a convincing impression of sincerity
he had been engaged five years before when douglas first came to birlstone
he understood that mr
douglas was a rich gentleman who had made his money in america
he had been a kind and considerate employer not quite what ames was used to perhaps but one can't have everything
he never saw any signs of apprehension in mr
douglas on the contrary he was the most fearless man he had ever known
he ordered the drawbridge to be pulled up every night because it was the ancient custom of the old house and he liked to keep the old ways up
mr
douglas seldom went to london or left the village but on the day before the crime he had been shopping at tunbridge wells
he ames had observed some restlessness and excitement on the part of mr
douglas that day for he had seemed impatient and irritable which was unusual with him
he had not gone to bed that night but was in the pantry at the back of the house putting away the silver when he heard the bell ring violently
he heard no shot but it was hardly possible he would as the pantry and kitchens were at the very back of the house and there were several closed doors and a long passage between
the housekeeper had come out of her room attracted by the violent ringing of the bell
they had gone to the front of the house together
as they reached the bottom of the stair he had seen mrs
douglas coming down it
no she was not hurrying it did not seem to him that she was particularly agitated
just as she reached the bottom of the stair mr
barker had rushed out of the study
he had stopped mrs
douglas and begged her to go back
for god's sake go back to your room
he cried
poor jack is dead
you can do nothing
for god's sake go back
after some persuasion upon the stairs mrs
douglas had gone back
she did not scream
she made no outcry whatever
mrs
allen the housekeeper had taken her upstairs and stayed with her in the bedroom
ames and mr
barker had then returned to the study where they had found everything exactly as the police had seen it
the candle was not lit at that time but the lamp was burning
they had looked out of the window but the night was very dark and nothing could be seen or heard
they had then rushed out into the hall where ames had turned the windlass which lowered the drawbridge
mr
barker had then hurried off to get the police
such in its essentials was the evidence of the butler
the account of mrs
allen the housekeeper was so far as it went a corroboration of that of her fellow servant
the housekeeper's room was rather nearer to the front of the house than the pantry in which ames had been working
she was preparing to go to bed when the loud ringing of the bell had attracted her attention
she was a little hard of hearing
perhaps that was why she had not heard the shot but in any case the study was a long way off
she remembered hearing some sound which she imagined to be the slamming of a door
that was a good deal earlier half an hour at least before the ringing of the bell
when mr
ames ran to the front she went with him
she saw mr
barker very pale and excited come out of the study
he intercepted mrs
douglas who was coming down the stairs
he entreated her to go back and she answered him but what she said could not be heard
take her up
stay with her
he had said to mrs
allen
she had therefore taken her to the bedroom and endeavoured to soothe her
she was greatly excited trembling all over but made no other attempt to go downstairs
she just sat in her dressing gown by her bedroom fire with her head sunk in her hands
mrs
allen stayed with her most of the night
as to the other servants they had all gone to bed and the alarm did not reach them until just before the police arrived
they slept at the extreme back of the house and could not possibly have heard anything
so far the housekeeper could add nothing on cross examination save lamentations and expressions of amazement
cecil barker succeeded mrs
allen as a witness
as to the occurrences of the night before he had very little to add to what he had already told the police
personally he was convinced that the murderer had escaped by the window
the bloodstain was conclusive in his opinion on that point
besides as the bridge was up there was no other possible way of escaping
he could not explain what had become of the assassin or why he had not taken his bicycle if it were indeed his
he could not possibly have been drowned in the moat which was at no place more than three feet deep
in his own mind he had a very definite theory about the murder
douglas was a reticent man and there were some chapters in his life of which he never spoke
he had emigrated to america when he was a very young man
he had prospered well and barker had first met him in california where they had become partners in a successful mining claim at a place called benito canyon
they had done very well but douglas had suddenly sold out and started for england
he was a widower at that time
barker had afterwards realized his money and come to live in london
thus they had renewed their friendship
douglas had given him the impression that some danger was hanging over his head and he had always looked upon his sudden departure from california and also his renting a house in so quiet a place in england as being connected with this peril
he imagined that some secret society some implacable organization was on douglas's track which would never rest until it killed him
some remarks of his had given him this idea though he had never told him what the society was nor how he had come to offend it
he could only suppose that the legend upon the placard had some reference to this secret society
how long were you with douglas in california
asked inspector macdonald
five years altogether
he was a bachelor you say
a widower
have you ever heard where his first wife came from
no i remember his saying that she was of german extraction and i have seen her portrait
she was a very beautiful woman
she died of typhoid the year before i met him
you don't associate his past with any particular part of america
i have heard him talk of chicago
he knew that city well and had worked there
i have heard him talk of the coal and iron districts
he had travelled a good deal in his time
was he a politician
had this secret society to do with politics
no he cared nothing about politics
you have no reason to think it was criminal
on the contrary i never met a straighter man in my life
was there anything curious about his life in california
he liked best to stay and to work at our claim in the mountains
he would never go where other men were if he could help it
that's why i first thought that someone was after him
then when he left so suddenly for europe i made sure that it was so
i believe that he had a warning of some sort
within a week of his leaving half a dozen men were inquiring for him
what sort of men
well they were a mighty hard looking crowd
they came up to the claim and wanted to know where he was
i told them that he was gone to europe and that i did not know where to find him
they meant him no good it was easy to see that
were these men americans californians
well i don't know about californians
they were americans all right
but they were not miners
i don't know what they were and was very glad to see their backs
that was six years ago
nearer seven
and then you were together five years in california so that this business dates back not less than eleven years at the least
that is so
it must be a very serious feud that would be kept up with such earnestness for as long as that
it would be no light thing that would give rise to it
i think it shadowed his whole life
it was never quite out of his mind
but if a man had a danger hanging over him and knew what it was don't you think he would turn to the police for protection
maybe it was some danger that he could not be protected against
there's one thing you should know
he always went about armed
his revolver was never out of his pocket
but by bad luck he was in his dressing gown and had left it in the bedroom last night
once the bridge was up i guess he thought he was safe
i should like these dates a little clearer said macdonald
it is quite six years since douglas left california
you followed him next year did you not
that is so
and he had been married five years
you must have returned about the time of his marriage
about a month before
i was his best man
did you know mrs
douglas before her marriage
no i did not
i had been away from england for ten years
but you have seen a good deal of her since
barker looked sternly at the detective
i have seen a good deal of him since he answered
if i have seen her it is because you cannot visit a man without knowing his wife
if you imagine there is any connection i imagine nothing mr
barker
i am bound to make every inquiry which can bear upon the case
but i mean no offense
some inquiries are offensive barker answered angrily
it's only the facts that we want
it is in your interest and everyone's interest that they should be cleared up
did mr
douglas entirely approve your friendship with his wife
barker grew paler and his great strong hands were clasped convulsively together
you have no right to ask such questions
he cried
what has this to do with the matter you are investigating
i must repeat the question
well i refuse to answer
you can refuse to answer but you must be aware that your refusal is in itself an answer for you would not refuse if you had not something to conceal
barker stood for a moment with his face set grimly and his strong black eyebrows drawn low in intense thought
then he looked up with a smile
well i guess you gentlemen are only doing your clear duty after all and i have no right to stand in the way of it
i'd only ask you not to worry mrs
douglas over this matter for she has enough upon her just now
i may tell you that poor douglas had just one fault in the world and that was his jealousy
he was fond of me no man could be fonder of a friend
and he was devoted to his wife
he loved me to come here and was forever sending for me
and yet if his wife and i talked together or there seemed any sympathy between us a kind of wave of jealousy would pass over him and he would be off the handle and saying the wildest things in a moment
more than once i've sworn off coming for that reason and then he would write me such penitent imploring letters that i just had to
but you can take it from me gentlemen if it was my last word that no man ever had a more loving faithful wife and i can say also no friend could be more loyal than i
it was spoken with fervour and feeling and yet inspector macdonald could not dismiss the subject
you are aware said he that the dead man's wedding ring has been taken from his finger
so it appears said barker
what do you mean by 'appears'
you know it as a fact
the man seemed confused and undecided
when i said 'appears' i meant that it was conceivable that he had himself taken off the ring
the mere fact that the ring should be absent whoever may have removed it would suggest to anyone's mind would it not that the marriage and the tragedy were connected
barker shrugged his broad shoulders
i can't profess to say what it means
he answered
but if you mean to hint that it could reflect in any way upon this lady's honour his eyes blazed for an instant and then with an evident effort he got a grip upon his own emotions well you are on the wrong track that's all
i don't know that i've anything else to ask you at present said macdonald coldly
there was one small point remarked sherlock holmes
when you entered the room there was only a candle lighted on the table was there not
yes that was so
by its light you saw that some terrible incident had occurred
exactly
you at once rang for help
yes
and it arrived very speedily
within a minute or so
and yet when they arrived they found that the candle was out and that the lamp had been lighted
that seems very remarkable
again barker showed some signs of indecision
i don't see that it was remarkable mr
holmes he answered after a pause
the candle threw a very bad light
my first thought was to get a better one
the lamp was on the table so i lit it
and blew out the candle
exactly
holmes asked no further question and barker with a deliberate look from one to the other of us which had as it seemed to me something of defiance in it turned and left the room
inspector macdonald had sent up a note to the effect that he would wait upon mrs
douglas in her room but she had replied that she would meet us in the dining room
she entered now a tall and beautiful woman of thirty reserved and self possessed to a remarkable degree very different from the tragic and distracted figure i had pictured
it is true that her face was pale and drawn like that of one who has endured a great shock but her manner was composed and the finely moulded hand which she rested upon the edge of the table was as steady as my own
her sad appealing eyes travelled from one to the other of us with a curiously inquisitive expression
that questioning gaze transformed itself suddenly into abrupt speech
have you found anything out yet
she asked
was it my imagination that there was an undertone of fear rather than of hope in the question
we have taken every possible step mrs
douglas said the inspector
you may rest assured that nothing will be neglected
spare no money she said in a dead even tone
it is my desire that every possible effort should be made
perhaps you can tell us something which may throw some light upon the matter
i fear not but all i know is at your service
we have heard from mr
cecil barker that you did not actually see that you were never in the room where the tragedy occurred
no he turned me back upon the stairs
he begged me to return to my room
quite so
you had heard the shot and you had at once come down
i put on my dressing gown and then came down
how long was it after hearing the shot that you were stopped on the stair by mr
barker
it may have been a couple of minutes
it is so hard to reckon time at such a moment
he implored me not to go on
he assured me that i could do nothing
then mrs
allen the housekeeper led me upstairs again
it was all like some dreadful dream
can you give us any idea how long your husband had been downstairs before you heard the shot
no i cannot say
he went from his dressing room and i did not hear him go
he did the round of the house every night for he was nervous of fire
it is the only thing that i have ever known him nervous of
that is just the point which i want to come to mrs
douglas
you have known your husband only in england have you not
yes we have been married five years
have you heard him speak of anything which occurred in america and might bring some danger upon him
mrs
douglas thought earnestly before she answered
yes
she said at last i have always felt that there was a danger hanging over him
he refused to discuss it with me
it was not from want of confidence in me there was the most complete love and confidence between us but it was out of his desire to keep all alarm away from me
he thought i should brood over it if i knew all and so he was silent
how did you know it then
mrs
douglas's face lit with a quick smile
can a husband ever carry about a secret all his life and a woman who loves him have no suspicion of it
i knew it by his refusal to talk about some episodes in his american life
i knew it by certain precautions he took
i knew it by certain words he let fall
i knew it by the way he looked at unexpected strangers
i was perfectly certain that he had some powerful enemies that he believed they were on his track and that he was always on his guard against them
i was so sure of it that for years i have been terrified if ever he came home later than was expected
might i ask asked holmes what the words were which attracted your attention
the valley of fear the lady answered
that was an expression he has used when i questioned him
'i have been in the valley of fear
i am not out of it yet '
'are we never to get out of the valley of fear '
i have asked him when i have seen him more serious than usual
'sometimes i think that we never shall ' he has answered
surely you asked him what he meant by the valley of fear
i did but his face would become very grave and he would shake his head
'it is bad enough that one of us should have been in its shadow ' he said
'please god it shall never fall upon you '
it was some real valley in which he had lived and in which something terrible had occurred to him of that i am certain but i can tell you no more
and he never mentioned any names
yes he was delirious with fever once when he had his hunting accident three years ago
then i remember that there was a name that came continually to his lips
he spoke it with anger and a sort of horror
mcginty was the name bodymaster mcginty
i asked him when he recovered who bodymaster mcginty was and whose body he was master of
'never of mine thank god '
he answered with a laugh and that was all i could get from him
but there is a connection between bodymaster mcginty and the valley of fear
there is one other point said inspector macdonald
you met mr
douglas in a boarding house in london did you not and became engaged to him there
was there any romance anything secret or mysterious about the wedding
there was romance
there is always romance
there was nothing mysterious
he had no rival
no i was quite free
you have heard no doubt that his wedding ring has been taken
does that suggest anything to you
suppose that some enemy of his old life had tracked him down and committed this crime what possible reason could he have for taking his wedding ring
for an instant i could have sworn that the faintest shadow of a smile flickered over the woman's lips
i really cannot tell she answered
it is certainly a most extraordinary thing
well we will not detain you any longer and we are sorry to have put you to this trouble at such a time said the inspector
there are some other points no doubt but we can refer to you as they arise
she rose and i was again conscious of that quick questioning glance with which she had just surveyed us
what impression has my evidence made upon you
the question might as well have been spoken
then with a bow she swept from the room
she's a beautiful woman a very beautiful woman said macdonald thoughtfully after the door had closed behind her
this man barker has certainly been down here a good deal
he is a man who might be attractive to a woman
he admits that the dead man was jealous and maybe he knew best himself what cause he had for jealousy
then there's that wedding ring
you can't get past that
the man who tears a wedding ring off a dead man's what do you say to it mr
holmes
my friend had sat with his head upon his hands sunk in the deepest thought
now he rose and rang the bell
ames he said when the butler entered where is mr
cecil barker now
i'll see sir
he came back in a moment to say that barker was in the garden
can you remember ames what mr
barker had on his feet last night when you joined him in the study
yes mr
holmes
he had a pair of bedroom slippers
i brought him his boots when he went for the police
where are the slippers now
they are still under the chair in the hall
very good ames
it is of course important for us to know which tracks may be mr
barker's and which from outside
yes sir
i may say that i noticed that the slippers were stained with blood so indeed were my own
that is natural enough considering the condition of the room
very good ames
we will ring if we want you
a few minutes later we were in the study
holmes had brought with him the carpet slippers from the hall
as ames had observed the soles of both were dark with blood
strange
murmured holmes as he stood in the light of the window and examined them minutely
very strange indeed
stooping with one of his quick feline pounces he placed the slipper upon the blood mark on the sill
it exactly corresponded
he smiled in silence at his colleagues
the inspector was transfigured with excitement
his native accent rattled like a stick upon railings
man he cried there's not a doubt of it
barker has just marked the window himself
it's a good deal broader than any bootmark
i mind that you said it was a splay foot and here's the explanation
but what's the game mr
holmes what's the game
ay what's the game
my friend repeated thoughtfully
white mason chuckled and rubbed his fat hands together in his professional satisfaction
i said it was a snorter
he cried
and a real snorter it is
the three detectives had many matters of detail into which to inquire so i returned alone to our modest quarters at the village inn
but before doing so i took a stroll in the curious old world garden which flanked the house
rows of very ancient yew trees cut into strange designs girded it round
inside was a beautiful stretch of lawn with an old sundial in the middle the whole effect so soothing and restful that it was welcome to my somewhat jangled nerves
in that deeply peaceful atmosphere one could forget or remember only as some fantastic nightmare that darkened study with the sprawling bloodstained figure on the floor
and yet as i strolled round it and tried to steep my soul in its gentle balm a strange incident occurred which brought me back to the tragedy and left a sinister impression in my mind
i have said that a decoration of yew trees circled the garden
at the end farthest from the house they thickened into a continuous hedge
on the other side of this hedge concealed from the eyes of anyone approaching from the direction of the house there was a stone seat
as i approached the spot i was aware of voices some remark in the deep tones of a man answered by a little ripple of feminine laughter
an instant later i had come round the end of the hedge and my eyes lit upon mrs
douglas and the man barker before they were aware of my presence
her appearance gave me a shock
in the dining room she had been demure and discreet
now all pretense of grief had passed away from her
her eyes shone with the joy of living and her face still quivered with amusement at some remark of her companion
he sat forward his hands clasped and his forearms on his knees with an answering smile upon his bold handsome face
in an instant but it was just one instant too late they resumed their solemn masks as my figure came into view
a hurried word or two passed between them and then barker rose and came towards me
excuse me sir said he but am i addressing dr
watson
i bowed with a coldness which showed i dare say very plainly the impression which had been produced upon my mind
we thought that it was probably you as your friendship with mr
sherlock holmes is so well known
would you mind coming over and speaking to mrs
douglas for one instant
i followed him with a dour face
very clearly i could see in my mind's eye that shattered figure on the floor
here within a few hours of the tragedy were his wife and his nearest friend laughing together behind a bush in the garden which had been his
i greeted the lady with reserve
i had grieved with her grief in the dining room
now i met her appealing gaze with an unresponsive eye
i fear that you think me callous and hard hearted
said she
i shrugged my shoulders
it is no business of mine said i
perhaps some day you will do me justice
if you only realized there is no need why dr
watson should realize said barker quickly
as he has himself said it is no possible business of his
exactly said i and so i will beg leave to resume my walk
one moment dr
watson cried the woman in a pleading voice
there is one question which you can answer with more authority than anyone else in the world and it may make a very great difference to me
you know mr
holmes and his relations with the police better than anyone else can
supposing that a matter were brought confidentially to his knowledge is it absolutely necessary that he should pass it on to the detectives
yes that's it said barker eagerly
is he on his own or is he entirely in with them
i really don't know that i should be justified in discussing such a point
i beg i implore that you will dr
watson
i assure you that you will be helping us helping me greatly if you will guide us on that point
there was such a ring of sincerity in the woman's voice that for the instant i forgot all about her levity and was moved only to do her will
mr
holmes is an independent investigator i said
he is his own master and would act as his own judgment directed
at the same time he would naturally feel loyalty towards the officials who were working on the same case and he would not conceal from them anything which would help them in bringing a criminal to justice
beyond this i can say nothing and i would refer you to mr
holmes himself if you wanted fuller information
so saying i raised my hat and went upon my way leaving them still seated behind that concealing hedge
i looked back as i rounded the far end of it and saw that they were still talking very earnestly together and as they were gazing after me it was clear that it was our interview that was the subject of their debate
i wish none of their confidences said holmes when i reported to him what had occurred
he had spent the whole afternoon at the manor house in consultation with his two colleagues and returned about five with a ravenous appetite for a high tea which i had ordered for him
no confidences watson for they are mighty awkward if it comes to an arrest for conspiracy and murder
you think it will come to that
he was in his most cheerful and debonair humour
my dear watson when i have exterminated that fourth egg i shall be ready to put you in touch with the whole situation
i don't say that we have fathomed it far from it but when we have traced the missing dumb bell the dumb bell
dear me watson is it possible that you have not penetrated the fact that the case hangs upon the missing dumb bell
well well you need not be downcast for between ourselves i don't think that either inspector mac or the excellent local practitioner has grasped the overwhelming importance of this incident
one dumb bell watson
consider an athlete with one dumb bell
picture to yourself the unilateral development the imminent danger of a spinal curvature
shocking watson shocking
he sat with his mouth full of toast and his eyes sparkling with mischief watching my intellectual entanglement
the mere sight of his excellent appetite was an assurance of success for i had very clear recollections of days and nights without a thought of food when his baffled mind had chafed before some problem while his thin eager features became more attenuated with the asceticism of complete mental concentration
finally he lit his pipe and sitting in the inglenook of the old village inn he talked slowly and at random about his case rather as one who thinks aloud than as one who makes a considered statement
a lie watson a great big thumping obtrusive uncompromising lie that's what meets us on the threshold
there is our starting point
the whole story told by barker is a lie
but barker's story is corroborated by mrs
douglas
therefore she is lying also
they are both lying and in a conspiracy
so now we have the clear problem
why are they lying and what is the truth which they are trying so hard to conceal
let us try watson you and i if we can get behind the lie and reconstruct the truth
how do i know that they are lying
because it is a clumsy fabrication which simply could not be true
consider
according to the story given to us the assassin had less than a minute after the murder had been committed to take that ring which was under another ring from the dead man's finger to replace the other ring a thing which he would surely never have done and to put that singular card beside his victim
i say that this was obviously impossible
you may argue but i have too much respect for your judgment watson to think that you will do so that the ring may have been taken before the man was killed
the fact that the candle had been lit only a short time shows that there had been no lengthy interview
was douglas from what we hear of his fearless character a man who would be likely to give up his wedding ring at such short notice or could we conceive of his giving it up at all
no no watson the assassin was alone with the dead man for some time with the lamp lit
of that i have no doubt at all
but the gunshot was apparently the cause of death
therefore the shot must have been fired some time earlier than we are told
but there could be no mistake about such a matter as that
we are in the presence therefore of a deliberate conspiracy upon the part of the two people who heard the gunshot of the man barker and of the woman douglas
when on the top of this i am able to show that the blood mark on the windowsill was deliberately placed there by barker in order to give a false clue to the police you will admit that the case grows dark against him
now we have to ask ourselves at what hour the murder actually did occur
up to half past ten the servants were moving about the house so it was certainly not before that time
at a quarter to eleven they had all gone to their rooms with the exception of ames who was in the pantry
i have been trying some experiments after you left us this afternoon and i find that no noise which macdonald can make in the study can penetrate to me in the pantry when the doors are all shut
it is otherwise however from the housekeeper's room
it is not so far down the corridor and from it i could vaguely hear a voice when it was very loudly raised
the sound from a shotgun is to some extent muffled when the discharge is at very close range as it undoubtedly was in this instance
it would not be very loud and yet in the silence of the night it should have easily penetrated to mrs
allen's room
she is as she has told us somewhat deaf but none the less she mentioned in her evidence that she did hear something like a door slamming half an hour before the alarm was given
half an hour before the alarm was given would be a quarter to eleven
i have no doubt that what she heard was the report of the gun and that this was the real instant of the murder
if this is so we have now to determine what barker and mrs
douglas presuming that they are not the actual murderers could have been doing from quarter to eleven when the sound of the shot brought them down until quarter past eleven when they rang the bell and summoned the servants
what were they doing and why did they not instantly give the alarm
that is the question which faces us and when it has been answered we shall surely have gone some way to solve our problem
i am convinced myself said i that there is an understanding between those two people
she must be a heartless creature to sit laughing at some jest within a few hours of her husband's murder
exactly
she does not shine as a wife even in her own account of what occurred
i am not a whole souled admirer of womankind as you are aware watson but my experience of life has taught me that there are few wives having any regard for their husbands who would let any man's spoken word stand between them and that husband's dead body
should i ever marry watson i should hope to inspire my wife with some feeling which would prevent her from being walked off by a housekeeper when my corpse was lying within a few yards of her
it was badly stage managed for even the rawest investigators must be struck by the absence of the usual feminine ululation
if there had been nothing else this incident alone would have suggested a prearranged conspiracy to my mind
you think then definitely that barker and mrs
douglas are guilty of the murder
there is an appalling directness about your questions watson said holmes shaking his pipe at me
they come at me like bullets
if you put it that mrs
douglas and barker know the truth about the murder and are conspiring to conceal it then i can give you a whole souled answer
i am sure they do
but your more deadly proposition is not so clear
let us for a moment consider the difficulties which stand in the way
we will suppose that this couple are united by the bonds of a guilty love and that they have determined to get rid of the man who stands between them
it is a large supposition for discreet inquiry among servants and others has failed to corroborate it in any way
on the contrary there is a good deal of evidence that the douglases were very attached to each other
that i am sure cannot be true
said i thinking of the beautiful smiling face in the garden
well at least they gave that impression
however we will suppose that they are an extraordinarily astute couple who deceive everyone upon this point and conspire to murder the husband
he happens to be a man over whose head some danger hangs we have only their word for that
holmes looked thoughtful
i see watson
you are sketching out a theory by which everything they say from the beginning is false
according to your idea there was never any hidden menace or secret society or valley of fear or boss macsomebody or anything else
well that is a good sweeping generalization
let us see what that brings us to
they invent this theory to account for the crime
they then play up to the idea by leaving this bicycle in the park as proof of the existence of some outsider
the stain on the windowsill conveys the same idea
so does the card on the body which might have been prepared in the house
that all fits into your hypothesis watson
but now we come on the nasty angular uncompromising bits which won't slip into their places
why a cut off shotgun of all weapons and an american one at that
how could they be so sure that the sound of it would not bring someone on to them
it's a mere chance as it is that mrs
allen did not start out to inquire for the slamming door
why did your guilty couple do all this watson
i confess that i can't explain it
then again if a woman and her lover conspire to murder a husband are they going to advertise their guilt by ostentatiously removing his wedding ring after his death
does that strike you as very probable watson
no it does not
and once again if the thought of leaving a bicycle concealed outside had occurred to you would it really have seemed worth doing when the dullest detective would naturally say this is an obvious blind as the bicycle is the first thing which the fugitive needed in order to make his escape
i can conceive of no explanation
and yet there should be no combination of events for which the wit of man cannot conceive an explanation
simply as a mental exercise without any assertion that it is true let me indicate a possible line of thought
it is i admit mere imagination but how often is imagination the mother of truth
we will suppose that there was a guilty secret a really shameful secret in the life of this man douglas
this leads to his murder by someone who is we will suppose an avenger someone from outside
this avenger for some reason which i confess i am still at a loss to explain took the dead man's wedding ring
the vendetta might conceivably date back to the man's first marriage and the ring be taken for some such reason
before this avenger got away barker and the wife had reached the room
the assassin convinced them that any attempt to arrest him would lead to the publication of some hideous scandal
they were converted to this idea and preferred to let him go
for this purpose they probably lowered the bridge which can be done quite noiselessly and then raised it again
he made his escape and for some reason thought that he could do so more safely on foot than on the bicycle
he therefore left his machine where it would not be discovered until he had got safely away
so far we are within the bounds of possibility are we not
well it is possible no doubt said i with some reserve
we have to remember watson that whatever occurred is certainly something very extraordinary
well now to continue our supposititious case the couple not necessarily a guilty couple realize after the murderer is gone that they have placed themselves in a position in which it may be difficult for them to prove that they did not themselves either do the deed or connive at it
they rapidly and rather clumsily met the situation
the mark was put by barker's bloodstained slipper upon the window sill to suggest how the fugitive got away
they obviously were the two who must have heard the sound of the gun so they gave the alarm exactly as they would have done but a good half hour after the event
and how do you propose to prove all this
well if there were an outsider he may be traced and taken
that would be the most effective of all proofs
but if not well the resources of science are far from being exhausted
i think that an evening alone in that study would help me much
an evening alone
i propose to go up there presently
i have arranged it with the estimable ames who is by no means whole hearted about barker
i shall sit in that room and see if its atmosphere brings me inspiration
i'm a believer in the genius loci
you smile friend watson
well we shall see
by the way you have that big umbrella of yours have you not
it is here
well i'll borrow that if i may
certainly but what a wretched weapon
if there is danger nothing serious my dear watson or i should certainly ask for your assistance
but i'll take the umbrella
at present i am only awaiting the return of our colleagues from tunbridge wells where they are at present engaged in trying for a likely owner to the bicycle
it was nightfall before inspector macdonald and white mason came back from their expedition and they arrived exultant reporting a great advance in our investigation
man i'll admeet that i had my doubts if there was ever an outsider said macdonald but that's all past now
we've had the bicycle identified and we have a description of our man so that's a long step on our journey
it sounds to me like the beginning of the end said holmes
i'm sure i congratulate you both with all my heart
well i started from the fact that mr
douglas had seemed disturbed since the day before when he had been at tunbridge wells
it was at tunbridge wells then that he had become conscious of some danger
it was clear therefore that if a man had come over with a bicycle it was from tunbridge wells that he might be expected to have come
we took the bicycle over with us and showed it at the hotels
it was identified at once by the manager of the eagle commercial as belonging to a man named hargrave who had taken a room there two days before
this bicycle and a small valise were his whole belongings
he had registered his name as coming from london but had given no address
the valise was london made and the contents were british but the man himself was undoubtedly an american
well well said holmes gleefully you have indeed done some solid work while i have been sitting spinning theories with my friend
it's a lesson in being practical mr
mac
ay it's just that mr
holmes said the inspector with satisfaction
but this may all fit in with your theories i remarked
that may or may not be
but let us hear the end mr
mac
was there nothing to identify this man
so little that it was evident that he had carefully guarded himself against identification
there were no papers or letters and no marking upon the clothes
a cycle map of the county lay on his bedroom table
he had left the hotel after breakfast yesterday morning on his bicycle and no more was heard of him until our inquiries
that's what puzzles me mr
holmes said white mason
if the fellow did not want the hue and cry raised over him one would imagine that he would have returned and remained at the hotel as an inoffensive tourist
as it is he must know that he will be reported to the police by the hotel manager and that his disappearance will be connected with the murder
so one would imagine
still he has been justified of his wisdom up to date at any rate since he has not been taken
but his description what of that
macdonald referred to his notebook
here we have it so far as they could give it
they don't seem to have taken any very particular stock of him but still the porter the clerk and the chambermaid are all agreed that this about covers the points
he was a man about five foot nine in height fifty or so years of age his hair slightly grizzled a grayish moustache a curved nose and a face which all of them described as fierce and forbidding
well bar the expression that might almost be a description of douglas himself said holmes
he is just over fifty with grizzled hair and moustache and about the same height
did you get anything else
he was dressed in a heavy gray suit with a reefer jacket and he wore a short yellow overcoat and a soft cap
what about the shotgun
it is less than two feet long
it could very well have fitted into his valise
he could have carried it inside his overcoat without difficulty
and how do you consider that all this bears upon the general case
well mr
holmes said macdonald when we have got our man and you may be sure that i had his description on the wires within five minutes of hearing it we shall be better able to judge
but even as it stands we have surely gone a long way
we know that an american calling himself hargrave came to tunbridge wells two days ago with bicycle and valise
in the latter was a sawed off shotgun so he came with the deliberate purpose of crime
yesterday morning he set off for this place on his bicycle with his gun concealed in his overcoat
no one saw him arrive so far as we can learn but he need not pass through the village to reach the park gates and there are many cyclists upon the road
presumably he at once concealed his cycle among the laurels where it was found and possibly lurked there himself with his eye on the house waiting for mr
douglas to come out
the shotgun is a strange weapon to use inside a house but he had intended to use it outside and there it has very obvious advantages as it would be impossible to miss with it and the sound of shots is so common in an english sporting neighbourhood that no particular notice would be taken
that is all very clear said holmes
well mr
douglas did not appear
what was he to do next
he left his bicycle and approached the house in the twilight
he found the bridge down and no one about
he took his chance intending no doubt to make some excuse if he met anyone
he met no one
he slipped into the first room that he saw and concealed himself behind the curtain
thence he could see the drawbridge go up and he knew that his only escape was through the moat
he waited until quarter past eleven when mr
douglas upon his usual nightly round came into the room
he shot him and escaped as arranged
he was aware that the bicycle would be described by the hotel people and be a clue against him so he left it there and made his way by some other means to london or to some safe hiding place which he had already arranged
how is that mr
holmes
well mr
mac it is very good and very clear so far as it goes
that is your end of the story
my end is that the crime was committed half an hour earlier than reported that mrs
douglas and barker are both in a conspiracy to conceal something that they aided the murderer's escape or at least that they reached the room before he escaped and that they fabricated evidence of his escape through the window whereas in all probability they had themselves let him go by lowering the bridge
that's my reading of the first half
the two detectives shook their heads
well mr
holmes if this is true we only tumble out of one mystery into another said the london inspector
and in some ways a worse one added white mason
the lady has never been in america in all her life
what possible connection could she have with an american assassin which would cause her to shelter him
i freely admit the difficulties said holmes
i propose to make a little investigation of my own to night and it is just possible that it may contribute something to the common cause
can we help you mr
holmes
no no
darkness and dr
watson's umbrella my wants are simple
and ames the faithful ames no doubt he will stretch a point for me
all my lines of thought lead me back invariably to the one basic question why should an athletic man develop his frame upon so unnatural an instrument as a single dumb bell
it was late that night when holmes returned from his solitary excursion
we slept in a double bedded room which was the best that the little country inn could do for us
i was already asleep when i was partly awakened by his entrance
well holmes i murmured have you found anything out
he stood beside me in silence his candle in his hand
then the tall lean figure inclined towards me
i say watson he whispered would you be afraid to sleep in the same room with a lunatic a man with softening of the brain an idiot whose mind has lost its grip
not in the least i answered in astonishment
ah that's lucky he said and not another word would he utter that night
next morning after breakfast we found inspector macdonald and white mason seated in close consultation in the small parlour of the local police sergeant
on the table in front of them were piled a number of letters and telegrams which they were carefully sorting and docketing
three had been placed on one side
still on the track of the elusive bicyclist
holmes asked cheerfully
what is the latest news of the ruffian
macdonald pointed ruefully to his heap of correspondence
he is at present reported from leicester nottingham southampton derby east ham richmond and fourteen other places
in three of them east ham leicester and liverpool there is a clear case against him and he has actually been arrested
the country seems to be full of the fugitives with yellow coats
dear me
said holmes sympathetically
now mr
mac and you mr
white mason i wish to give you a very earnest piece of advice
when i went into this case with you i bargained as you will no doubt remember that i should not present you with half proved theories but that i should retain and work out my own ideas until i had satisfied myself that they were correct
for this reason i am not at the present moment telling you all that is in my mind
on the other hand i said that i would play the game fairly by you and i do not think it is a fair game to allow you for one unnecessary moment to waste your energies upon a profitless task
therefore i am here to advise you this morning and my advice to you is summed up in three words abandon the case
macdonald and white mason stared in amazement at their celebrated colleague
you consider it hopeless
cried the inspector
i consider your case to be hopeless
i do not consider that it is hopeless to arrive at the truth
but this cyclist
he is not an invention
we have his description his valise his bicycle
the fellow must be somewhere
why should we not get him
yes yes no doubt he is somewhere and no doubt we shall get him but i would not have you waste your energies in east ham or liverpool
i am sure that we can find some shorter cut to a result
you are holding something back
it's hardly fair of you mr
holmes
the inspector was annoyed
you know my methods of work mr
mac
but i will hold it back for the shortest time possible
i only wish to verify my details in one way which can very readily be done and then i make my bow and return to london leaving my results entirely at your service
i owe you too much to act otherwise for in all my experience i cannot recall any more singular and interesting study
this is clean beyond me mr
holmes
we saw you when we returned from tunbridge wells last night and you were in general agreement with our results
what has happened since then to give you a completely new idea of the case
well since you ask me i spent as i told you that i would some hours last night at the manor house
well what happened
ah i can only give you a very general answer to that for the moment
by the way i have been reading a short but clear and interesting account of the old building purchasable at the modest sum of one penny from the local tobacconist
here holmes drew a small tract embellished with a rude engraving of the ancient manor house from his waistcoat pocket
it immensely adds to the zest of an investigation my dear mr
mac when one is in conscious sympathy with the historical atmosphere of one's surroundings
don't look so impatient for i assure you that even so bald an account as this raises some sort of picture of the past in one's mind
permit me to give you a sample
'erected in the fifth year of the reign of james i and standing upon the site of a much older building the manor house of birlstone presents one of the finest surviving examples of the moated jacobean residence ' you are making fools of us mr
holmes
tut tut mr
mac the first sign of temper i have detected in you
well i won't read it verbatim since you feel so strongly upon the subject
but when i tell you that there is some account of the taking of the place by a parliamentary colonel in of the concealment of charles for several days in the course of the civil war and finally of a visit there by the second george you will admit that there are various associations of interest connected with this ancient house
i don't doubt it mr
holmes but that is no business of ours
is it not
is it not
breadth of view my dear mr
mac is one of the essentials of our profession
the interplay of ideas and the oblique uses of knowledge are often of extraordinary interest
you will excuse these remarks from one who though a mere connoisseur of crime is still rather older and perhaps more experienced than yourself
i'm the first to admit that said the detective heartily
you get to your point i admit but you have such a deuced round the corner way of doing it
well well i'll drop past history and get down to present day facts
i called last night as i have already said at the manor house
i did not see either barker or mrs
douglas
i saw no necessity to disturb them but i was pleased to hear that the lady was not visibly pining and that she had partaken of an excellent dinner
my visit was specially made to the good mr
ames with whom i exchanged some amiabilities which culminated in his allowing me without reference to anyone else to sit alone for a time in the study
what
with that
i ejaculated
no no everything is now in order
you gave permission for that mr
mac as i am informed
the room was in its normal state and in it i passed an instructive quarter of an hour
what were you doing
well not to make a mystery of so simple a matter i was looking for the missing dumb bell
it has always bulked rather large in my estimate of the case
i ended by finding it
where
ah there we come to the edge of the unexplored
let me go a little further a very little further and i will promise that you shall share everything that i know
well we're bound to take you on your own terms said the inspector but when it comes to telling us to abandon the case why in the name of goodness should we abandon the case
for the simple reason my dear mr
mac that you have not got the first idea what it is that you are investigating
we are investigating the murder of mr
john douglas of birlstone manor
yes yes so you are
but don't trouble to trace the mysterious gentleman upon the bicycle
i assure you that it won't help you
then what do you suggest that we do
i will tell you exactly what to do if you will do it
well i'm bound to say i've always found you had reason behind all your queer ways
i'll do what you advise
and you mr
white mason
the country detective looked helplessly from one to the other
holmes and his methods were new to him
well if it is good enough for the inspector it is good enough for me he said at last
capital
said holmes
well then i should recommend a nice cheery country walk for both of you
they tell me that the views from birlstone ridge over the weald are very remarkable
no doubt lunch could be got at some suitable hostelry though my ignorance of the country prevents me from recommending one
in the evening tired but happy man this is getting past a joke
cried macdonald rising angrily from his chair
well well spend the day as you like said holmes patting him cheerfully upon the shoulder
do what you like and go where you will but meet me here before dusk without fail without fail mr
mac
that sounds more like sanity
all of it was excellent advice but i don't insist so long as you are here when i need you
but now before we part i want you to write a note to mr
barker
well
i'll dictate it if you like
ready
dear sir it has struck me that it is our duty to drain the moat in the hope that we may find some it's impossible said the inspector
i've made inquiry
tut tut
my dear sir please do what i ask you
well go on
in the hope that we may find something which may bear upon our investigation
i have made arrangements and the workmen will be at work early to morrow morning diverting the stream impossible
diverting the stream so i thought it best to explain matters beforehand
now sign that and send it by hand about four o'clock
at that hour we shall meet again in this room
until then we may each do what we like for i can assure you that this inquiry has come to a definite pause
evening was drawing in when we reassembled
holmes was very serious in his manner myself curious and the detectives obviously critical and annoyed
well gentlemen said my friend gravely i am asking you now to put everything to the test with me and you will judge for yourselves whether the observations i have made justify the conclusions to which i have come
it is a chill evening and i do not know how long our expedition may last so i beg that you will wear your warmest coats
it is of the first importance that we should be in our places before it grows dark so with your permission we shall get started at once
we passed along the outer bounds of the manor house park until we came to a place where there was a gap in the rails which fenced it
through this we slipped and then in the gathering gloom we followed holmes until we had reached a shrubbery which lies nearly opposite to the main door and the drawbridge
the latter had not been raised
holmes crouched down behind the screen of laurels and we all three followed his example
well what are we to do now
asked macdonald with some gruffness
possess our souls in patience and make as little noise as possible holmes answered
what are we here for at all
i really think that you might treat us with more frankness
holmes laughed
watson insists that i am the dramatist in real life said he
some touch of the artist wells up within me and calls insistently for a well staged performance
surely our profession mr
mac would be a drab and sordid one if we did not sometimes set the scene so as to glorify our results
the blunt accusation the brutal tap upon the shoulder what can one make of such a denouement
but the quick inference the subtle trap the clever forecast of coming events the triumphant vindication of bold theories are these not the pride and the justification of our life's work
at the present moment you thrill with the glamour of the situation and the anticipation of the hunt
where would be that thrill if i had been as definite as a timetable
i only ask a little patience mr
mac and all will be clear to you
well i hope the pride and justification and the rest of it will come before we all get our death of cold said the london detective with comic resignation
we all had good reason to join in the aspiration for our vigil was a long and bitter one
slowly the shadows darkened over the long sombre face of the old house
a cold damp reek from the moat chilled us to the bones and set our teeth chattering
there was a single lamp over the gateway and a steady globe of light in the fatal study
everything else was dark and still
how long is this to last
asked the inspector finally
and what is it we are watching for
i have no more notion than you how long it is to last holmes answered with some asperity
if criminals would always schedule their movements like railway trains it would certainly be more convenient for all of us
as to what it is we well that's what we are watching for
as he spoke the bright yellow light in the study was obscured by somebody passing to and fro before it
the laurels among which we lay were immediately opposite the window and not more than a hundred feet from it
presently it was thrown open with a whining of hinges and we could dimly see the dark outline of a man's head and shoulders looking out into the gloom
for some minutes he peered forth in furtive stealthy fashion as one who wishes to be assured that he is unobserved
then he leaned forward and in the intense silence we were aware of the soft lapping of agitated water
he seemed to be stirring up the moat with something which he held in his hand
then suddenly he hauled something in as a fisherman lands a fish some large round object which obscured the light as it was dragged through the open casement
now
cried holmes
now
we were all upon our feet staggering after him with our stiffened limbs while he ran swiftly across the bridge and rang violently at the bell
there was the rasping of bolts from the other side and the amazed ames stood in the entrance
holmes brushed him aside without a word and followed by all of us rushed into the room which had been occupied by the man whom we had been watching
the oil lamp on the table represented the glow which we had seen from outside
it was now in the hand of cecil barker who held it towards us as we entered
its light shone upon his strong resolute clean shaved face and his menacing eyes
what the devil is the meaning of all this
he cried
what are you after anyhow
holmes took a swift glance round and then pounced upon a sodden bundle tied together with cord which lay where it had been thrust under the writing table
this is what we are after mr
barker this bundle weighted with a dumb bell which you have just raised from the bottom of the moat
barker stared at holmes with amazement in his face
how in thunder came you to know anything about it
he asked
simply that i put it there
you put it there
you
perhaps i should have said 'replaced it there ' said holmes
you will remember inspector macdonald that i was somewhat struck by the absence of a dumb bell
i drew your attention to it but with the pressure of other events you had hardly the time to give it the consideration which would have enabled you to draw deductions from it
when water is near and a weight is missing it is not a very far fetched supposition that something has been sunk in the water
the idea was at least worth testing so with the help of ames who admitted me to the room and the crook of dr
watson's umbrella i was able last night to fish up and inspect this bundle
it was of the first importance however that we should be able to prove who placed it there
this we accomplished by the very obvious device of announcing that the moat would be dried to morrow which had of course the effect that whoever had hidden the bundle would most certainly withdraw it the moment that darkness enabled him to do so
we have no less than four witnesses as to who it was who took advantage of the opportunity and so mr
barker i think the word lies now with you
sherlock holmes put the sopping bundle upon the table beside the lamp and undid the cord which bound it
from within he extracted a dumb bell which he tossed down to its fellow in the corner
next he drew forth a pair of boots
american as you perceive he remarked pointing to the toes
then he laid upon the table a long deadly sheathed knife
finally he unravelled a bundle of clothing comprising a complete set of underclothes socks a gray tweed suit and a short yellow overcoat
the clothes are commonplace remarked holmes save only the overcoat which is full of suggestive touches
he held it tenderly towards the light
here as you perceive is the inner pocket prolonged into the lining in such fashion as to give ample space for the truncated fowling piece
the tailor's tab is on the neck 'neal outfitter vermissa u s
a '
i have spent an instructive afternoon in the rector's library and have enlarged my knowledge by adding the fact that vermissa is a flourishing little town at the head of one of the best known coal and iron valleys in the united states
i have some recollection mr
barker that you associated the coal districts with mr
douglas's first wife and it would surely not be too far fetched an inference that the v v upon the card by the dead body might stand for vermissa valley or that this very valley which sends forth emissaries of murder may be that valley of fear of which we have heard
so much is fairly clear
and now mr
barker i seem to be standing rather in the way of your explanation
it was a sight to see cecil barker's expressive face during this exposition of the great detective
anger amazement consternation and indecision swept over it in turn
finally he took refuge in a somewhat acrid irony
you know such a lot mr
holmes perhaps you had better tell us some more he sneered
i have no doubt that i could tell you a great deal more mr
barker but it would come with a better grace from you
oh you think so do you
well all i can say is that if there's any secret here it is not my secret and i am not the man to give it away
well if you take that line mr
barker said the inspector quietly we must just keep you in sight until we have the warrant and can hold you
you can do what you damn please about that said barker defiantly
the proceedings seemed to have come to a definite end so far as he was concerned for one had only to look at that granite face to realize that no peine forte et dure would ever force him to plead against his will
the deadlock was broken however by a woman's voice
mrs
douglas had been standing listening at the half opened door and now she entered the room
you have done enough for now cecil said she
whatever comes of it in the future you have done enough
enough and more than enough remarked sherlock holmes gravely
i have every sympathy with you madam and should strongly urge you to have some confidence in the common sense of our jurisdiction and to take the police voluntarily into your complete confidence
it may be that i am myself at fault for not following up the hint which you conveyed to me through my friend dr
watson but at that time i had every reason to believe that you were directly concerned in the crime
now i am assured that this is not so
at the same time there is much that is unexplained and i should strongly recommend that you ask mr
douglas to tell us his own story
mrs
douglas gave a cry of astonishment at holmes's words
the detectives and i must have echoed it when we were aware of a man who seemed to have emerged from the wall who advanced now from the gloom of the corner in which he had appeared
mrs
douglas turned and in an instant her arms were round him
barker had seized his outstretched hand
it's best this way jack his wife repeated i am sure that it is best
indeed yes mr
douglas said sherlock holmes i am sure that you will find it best
the man stood blinking at us with the dazed look of one who comes from the dark into the light
it was a remarkable face bold gray eyes a strong short clipped grizzled moustache a square projecting chin and a humorous mouth
he took a good look at us all and then to my amazement he advanced to me and handed me a bundle of paper
i've heard of you said he in a voice which was not quite english and not quite american but was altogether mellow and pleasing
you are the historian of this bunch
well dr
watson you've never had such a story as that pass through your hands before and i'll lay my last dollar on that
tell it your own way but there are the facts and you can't miss the public so long as you have those
i've been cooped up two days and i've spent the daylight hours as much daylight as i could get in that rat trap in putting the thing into words
you're welcome to them you and your public
there's the story of the valley of fear
that's the past mr
douglas said sherlock holmes quietly
what we desire now is to hear your story of the present
you'll have it sir said douglas
may i smoke as i talk
well thank you mr
holmes
you're a smoker yourself if i remember right and you'll guess what it is to be sitting for two days with tobacco in your pocket and afraid that the smell will give you away
he leaned against the mantelpiece and sucked at the cigar which holmes had handed him
i've heard of you mr
holmes
i never guessed that i should meet you
but before you are through with that he nodded at my papers you will say i've brought you something fresh
inspector macdonald had been staring at the newcomer with the greatest amazement
well this fairly beats me
he cried at last
if you are mr
john douglas of birlstone manor then whose death have we been investigating for these two days and where in the world have you sprung from now
you seemed to me to come out of the floor like a jack in a box
ah mr
mac said holmes shaking a reproving forefinger you would not read that excellent local compilation which described the concealment of king charles
people did not hide in those days without excellent hiding places and the hiding place that has once been used may be again
i had persuaded myself that we should find mr
douglas under this roof
and how long have you been playing this trick upon us mr
holmes
said the inspector angrily
how long have you allowed us to waste ourselves upon a search that you knew to be an absurd one
not one instant my dear mr
mac
only last night did i form my views of the case
as they could not be put to the proof until this evening i invited you and your colleague to take a holiday for the day
pray what more could i do
when i found the suit of clothes in the moat it at once became apparent to me that the body we had found could not have been the body of mr
john douglas at all but must be that of the bicyclist from tunbridge wells
no other conclusion was possible
therefore i had to determine where mr
john douglas himself could be and the balance of probability was that with the connivance of his wife and his friend he was concealed in a house which had such conveniences for a fugitive and awaiting quieter times when he could make his final escape
well you figured it out about right said douglas approvingly
i thought i'd dodge your british law for i was not sure how i stood under it and also i saw my chance to throw these hounds once for all off my track
mind you from first to last i have done nothing to be ashamed of and nothing that i would not do again but you'll judge that for yourselves when i tell you my story
never mind warning me inspector i'm ready to stand pat upon the truth
i'm not going to begin at the beginning
that's all there he indicated my bundle of papers and a mighty queer yarn you'll find it
it all comes down to this that there are some men that have good cause to hate me and would give their last dollar to know that they had got me
so long as i am alive and they are alive there is no safety in this world for me
they hunted me from chicago to california then they chased me out of america but when i married and settled down in this quiet spot i thought my last years were going to be peaceable
i never explained to my wife how things were
why should i pull her into it
she would never have a quiet moment again but would always be imagining trouble
i fancy she knew something for i may have dropped a word here or a word there but until yesterday after you gentlemen had seen her she never knew the rights of the matter
she told you all she knew and so did barker here for on the night when this thing happened there was mighty little time for explanations
she knows everything now and i would have been a wiser man if i had told her sooner
but it was a hard question dear he took her hand for an instant in his own and i acted for the best
well gentlemen the day before these happenings i was over in tunbridge wells and i got a glimpse of a man in the street
it was only a glimpse but i have a quick eye for these things and i never doubted who it was
it was the worst enemy i had among them all one who has been after me like a hungry wolf after a caribou all these years
i knew there was trouble coming and i came home and made ready for it
i guessed i'd fight through it all right on my own my luck was a proverb in the states about '
i never doubted that it would be with me still
i was on my guard all that next day and never went out into the park
it's as well or he'd have had the drop on me with that buckshot gun of his before ever i could draw on him
after the bridge was up my mind was always more restful when that bridge was up in the evenings i put the thing clear out of my head
i never dreamed of his getting into the house and waiting for me
but when i made my round in my dressing gown as was my habit i had no sooner entered the study than i scented danger
i guess when a man has had dangers in his life and i've had more than most in my time there is a kind of sixth sense that waves the red flag
i saw the signal clear enough and yet i couldn't tell you why
next instant i spotted a boot under the window curtain and then i saw why plain enough
i'd just the one candle that was in my hand but there was a good light from the hall lamp through the open door
i put down the candle and jumped for a hammer that i'd left on the mantel
at the same moment he sprang at me
i saw the glint of a knife and i lashed at him with the hammer
i got him somewhere for the knife tinkled down on the floor
he dodged round the table as quick as an eel and a moment later he'd got his gun from under his coat
i heard him cock it but i had got hold of it before he could fire
i had it by the barrel and we wrestled for it all ends up for a minute or more
it was death to the man that lost his grip
he never lost his grip but he got it butt downward for a moment too long
maybe it was i that pulled the trigger
maybe we just jolted it off between us
anyhow he got both barrels in the face and there i was staring down at all that was left of ted baldwin
i'd recognized him in the township and again when he sprang for me but his own mother wouldn't recognize him as i saw him then
i'm used to rough work but i fairly turned sick at the sight of him
i was hanging on the side of the table when barker came hurrying down
i heard my wife coming and i ran to the door and stopped her
it was no sight for a woman
i promised i'd come to her soon
i said a word or two to barker he took it all in at a glance and we waited for the rest to come along
but there was no sign of them
then we understood that they could hear nothing and that all that had happened was known only to ourselves
it was at that instant that the idea came to me
i was fairly dazzled by the brilliance of it
the man's sleeve had slipped up and there was the branded mark of the lodge upon his forearm
see here
the man whom we had known as douglas turned up his own coat and cuff to show a brown triangle within a circle exactly like that which we had seen upon the dead man
it was the sight of that which started me on it
i seemed to see it all clear at a glance
there were his height and hair and figure about the same as my own
no one could swear to his face poor devil
i brought down this suit of clothes and in a quarter of an hour barker and i had put my dressing gown on him and he lay as you found him
we tied all his things into a bundle and i weighted them with the only weight i could find and put them through the window
the card he had meant to lay upon my body was lying beside his own
my rings were put on his finger but when it came to the wedding ring he held out his muscular hand you can see for yourselves that i had struck the limit
i have not moved it since the day i was married and it would have taken a file to get it off
i don't know anyhow that i should have cared to part with it but if i had wanted to i couldn't
so we just had to leave that detail to take care of itself
on the other hand i brought a bit of plaster down and put it where i am wearing one myself at this instant
you slipped up there mr
holmes clever as you are for if you had chanced to take off that plaster you would have found no cut underneath it
well that was the situation
if i could lie low for a while and then get away where i could be joined by my 'widow' we should have a chance at last of living in peace for the rest of our lives
these devils would give me no rest so long as i was above ground but if they saw in the papers that baldwin had got his man there would be an end of all my troubles
i hadn't much time to make it all clear to barker and to my wife but they understood enough to be able to help me
i knew all about this hiding place so did ames but it never entered his head to connect it with the matter
i retired into it and it was up to barker to do the rest
i guess you can fill in for yourselves what he did
he opened the window and made the mark on the sill to give an idea of how the murderer escaped
it was a tall order that but as the bridge was up there was no other way
then when everything was fixed he rang the bell for all he was worth
what happened afterward you know
and so gentlemen you can do what you please but i've told you the truth and the whole truth so help me god
what i ask you now is how do i stand by the english law
there was a silence which was broken by sherlock holmes
the english law is in the main a just law
you will get no worse than your deserts from that mr
douglas
but i would ask you how did this man know that you lived here or how to get into your house or where to hide to get you
i know nothing of this
holmes's face was very white and grave
the story is not over yet i fear said he
you may find worse dangers than the english law or even than your enemies from america
i see trouble before you mr
douglas
you'll take my advice and still be on your guard
and now my long suffering readers i will ask you to come away with me for a time far from the sussex manor house of birlstone and far also from the year of grace in which we made our eventful journey which ended with the strange story of the man who had been known as john douglas
i wish you to journey back some twenty years in time and westward some thousands of miles in space that i may lay before you a singular and terrible narrative so singular and so terrible that you may find it hard to believe that even as i tell it even so did it occur
do not think that i intrude one story before another is finished
as you read on you will find that this is not so
and when i have detailed those distant events and you have solved this mystery of the past we shall meet once more in those rooms on baker street where this like so many other wonderful happenings will find its end
it was the fourth of february in the year
it had been a severe winter and the snow lay deep in the gorges of the gilmerton mountains
the steam ploughs had however kept the railroad open and the evening train which connects the long line of coal mining and iron working settlements was slowly groaning its way up the steep gradients which lead from stagville on the plain to vermissa the central township which lies at the head of vermissa valley
from this point the track sweeps downward to bartons crossing helmdale and the purely agricultural county of merton
it was a single track railroad but at every siding and they were numerous long lines of trucks piled with coal and iron ore told of the hidden wealth which had brought a rude population and a bustling life to this most desolate corner of the united states of america
for desolate it was
little could the first pioneer who had traversed it have ever imagined that the fairest prairies and the most lush water pastures were valueless compared to this gloomy land of black crag and tangled forest
above the dark and often scarcely penetrable woods upon their flanks the high bare crowns of the mountains white snow and jagged rock towered upon each flank leaving a long winding tortuous valley in the centre
up this the little train was slowly crawling
the oil lamps had just been lit in the leading passenger car a long bare carriage in which some twenty or thirty people were seated
the greater number of these were workmen returning from their day's toil in the lower part of the valley
at least a dozen by their grimed faces and the safety lanterns which they carried proclaimed themselves miners
these sat smoking in a group and conversed in low voices glancing occasionally at two men on the opposite side of the car whose uniforms and badges showed them to be policemen
several women of the labouring class and one or two travellers who might have been small local storekeepers made up the rest of the company with the exception of one young man in a corner by himself
it is with this man that we are concerned
take a good look at him for he is worth it
he is a fresh complexioned middle sized young man not far one would guess from his thirtieth year
he has large shrewd humorous gray eyes which twinkle inquiringly from time to time as he looks round through his spectacles at the people about him
it is easy to see that he is of a sociable and possibly simple disposition anxious to be friendly to all men
anyone could pick him at once as gregarious in his habits and communicative in his nature with a quick wit and a ready smile
and yet the man who studied him more closely might discern a certain firmness of jaw and grim tightness about the lips which would warn him that there were depths beyond and that this pleasant brown haired young irishman might conceivably leave his mark for good or evil upon any society to which he was introduced
having made one or two tentative remarks to the nearest miner and receiving only short gruff replies the traveller resigned himself to uncongenial silence staring moodily out of the window at the fading landscape
it was not a cheering prospect
through the growing gloom there pulsed the red glow of the furnaces on the sides of the hills
great heaps of slag and dumps of cinders loomed up on each side with the high shafts of the collieries towering above them
huddled groups of mean wooden houses the windows of which were beginning to outline themselves in light were scattered here and there along the line and the frequent halting places were crowded with their swarthy inhabitants
the iron and coal valleys of the vermissa district were no resorts for the leisured or the cultured
everywhere there were stern signs of the crudest battle of life the rude work to be done and the rude strong workers who did it
the young traveller gazed out into this dismal country with a face of mingled repulsion and interest which showed that the scene was new to him
at intervals he drew from his pocket a bulky letter to which he referred and on the margins of which he scribbled some notes
once from the back of his waist he produced something which one would hardly have expected to find in the possession of so mild mannered a man
it was a navy revolver of the largest size
as he turned it slantwise to the light the glint upon the rims of the copper shells within the drum showed that it was fully loaded
he quickly restored it to his secret pocket but not before it had been observed by a working man who had seated himself upon the adjoining bench
hullo mate
said he
you seem heeled and ready
the young man smiled with an air of embarrassment
yes said he we need them sometimes in the place i come from
and where may that be
i'm last from chicago
a stranger in these parts
yes
you may find you need it here said the workman
ah
is that so
the young man seemed interested
have you heard nothing of doings hereabouts
nothing out of the way
why i thought the country was full of it
you'll hear quick enough
what made you come here
i heard there was always work for a willing man
are you a member of the union
sure
then you'll get your job i guess
have you any friends
not yet but i have the means of making them
how's that then
i am one of the eminent order of freemen
there's no town without a lodge and where there is a lodge i'll find my friends
the remark had a singular effect upon his companion
he glanced round suspiciously at the others in the car
the miners were still whispering among themselves
the two police officers were dozing
he came across seated himself close to the young traveller and held out his hand
put it there he said
a hand grip passed between the two
i see you speak the truth said the workman
but it's well to make certain
he raised his right hand to his right eyebrow
the traveller at once raised his left hand to his left eyebrow
dark nights are unpleasant said the workman
yes for strangers to travel the other answered
that's good enough
i'm brother scanlan lodge vermissa valley
glad to see you in these parts
thank you
i'm brother john mcmurdo lodge chicago
bodymaster j h scott
but i am in luck to meet a brother so early
well there are plenty of us about
you won't find the order more flourishing anywhere in the states than right here in vermissa valley
but we could do with some lads like you
i can't understand a spry man of the union finding no work to do in chicago
i found plenty of work to do said mcmurdo
then why did you leave
mcmurdo nodded towards the policemen and smiled
i guess those chaps would be glad to know he said
scanlan groaned sympathetically
in trouble
he asked in a whisper
deep
a penitentiary job
and the rest
not a killing
it's early days to talk of such things said mcmurdo with the air of a man who had been surprised into saying more than he intended
i've my own good reasons for leaving chicago and let that be enough for you
who are you that you should take it on yourself to ask such things
his gray eyes gleamed with sudden and dangerous anger from behind his glasses
all right mate no offense meant
the boys will think none the worse of you whatever you may have done
where are you bound for now
vermissa
that's the third halt down the line
where are you staying
mcmurdo took out an envelope and held it close to the murky oil lamp
here is the address jacob shafter sheridan street
it's a boarding house that was recommended by a man i knew in chicago
well i don't know it but vermissa is out of my beat
i live at hobson's patch and that's here where we are drawing up
but say there's one bit of advice i'll give you before we part if you're in trouble in vermissa go straight to the union house and see boss mcginty
he is the bodymaster of vermissa lodge and nothing can happen in these parts unless black jack mcginty wants it
so long mate
maybe we'll meet in lodge one of these evenings
but mind my words if you are in trouble go to boss mcginty
scanlan descended and mcmurdo was left once again to his thoughts
night had now fallen and the flames of the frequent furnaces were roaring and leaping in the darkness
against their lurid background dark figures were bending and straining twisting and turning with the motion of winch or of windlass to the rhythm of an eternal clank and roar
i guess hell must look something like that said a voice
mcmurdo turned and saw that one of the policemen had shifted in his seat and was staring out into the fiery waste
for that matter said the other policeman i allow that hell must be something like that
if there are worse devils down yonder than some we could name it's more than i'd expect
i guess you are new to this part young man
well what if i am
mcmurdo answered in a surly voice
just this mister that i should advise you to be careful in choosing your friends
i don't think i'd begin with mike scanlan or his gang if i were you
what the hell is it to you who are my friends
roared mcmurdo in a voice which brought every head in the carriage round to witness the altercation
did i ask you for your advice or did you think me such a sucker that i couldn't move without it
you speak when you are spoken to and by the lord you'd have to wait a long time if it was me
he thrust out his face and grinned at the patrolmen like a snarling dog
the two policemen heavy good natured men were taken aback by the extraordinary vehemence with which their friendly advances had been rejected
no offense stranger said one
it was a warning for your own good seeing that you are by your own showing new to the place
i'm new to the place but i'm not new to you and your kind
cried mcmurdo in cold fury
i guess you're the same in all places shoving your advice in when nobody asks for it
maybe we'll see more of you before very long said one of the patrolmen with a grin
you're a real hand picked one if i am a judge
i was thinking the same remarked the other
i guess we may meet again
i'm not afraid of you and don't you think it
cried mcmurdo
my name's jack mcmurdo see
if you want me you'll find me at jacob shafter's on sheridan street vermissa so i'm not hiding from you am i
day or night i dare to look the like of you in the face don't make any mistake about that
there was a murmur of sympathy and admiration from the miners at the dauntless demeanour of the newcomer while the two policemen shrugged their shoulders and renewed a conversation between themselves
a few minutes later the train ran into the ill lit station and there was a general clearing for vermissa was by far the largest town on the line
mcmurdo picked up his leather gripsack and was about to start off into the darkness when one of the miners accosted him
by gar mate
you know how to speak to the cops he said in a voice of awe
it was grand to hear you
let me carry your grip and show you the road
i'm passing shafter's on the way to my own shack
there was a chorus of friendly good nights from the other miners as they passed from the platform
before ever he had set foot in it mcmurdo the turbulent had become a character in vermissa
the country had been a place of terror but the town was in its way even more depressing
down that long valley there was at least a certain gloomy grandeur in the huge fires and the clouds of drifting smoke while the strength and industry of man found fitting monuments in the hills which he had spilled by the side of his monstrous excavations
but the town showed a dead level of mean ugliness and squalor
the broad street was churned up by the traffic into a horrible rutted paste of muddy snow
the sidewalks were narrow and uneven
the numerous gas lamps served only to show more clearly a long line of wooden houses each with its veranda facing the street unkempt and dirty
as they approached the centre of the town the scene was brightened by a row of well lit stores and even more by a cluster of saloons and gaming houses in which the miners spent their hard earned but generous wages
that's the union house said the guide pointing to one saloon which rose almost to the dignity of being a hotel
jack mcginty is the boss there
what sort of a man is he
mcmurdo asked
what
have you never heard of the boss
how could i have heard of him when you know that i am a stranger in these parts
well i thought his name was known clear across the country
it's been in the papers often enough
what for
well the miner lowered his voice over the affairs
what affairs
good lord mister
you are queer if i must say it without offense
there's only one set of affairs that you'll hear of in these parts and that's the affairs of the scowrers
why i seem to have read of the scowrers in chicago
a gang of murderers are they not
hush on your life
cried the miner standing still in alarm and gazing in amazement at his companion
man you won't live long in these parts if you speak in the open street like that
many a man has had the life beaten out of him for less
well i know nothing about them
it's only what i have read
and i'm not saying that you have not read the truth
the man looked nervously round him as he spoke peering into the shadows as if he feared to see some lurking danger
if killing is murder then god knows there is murder and to spare
but don't you dare to breathe the name of jack mcginty in connection with it stranger for every whisper goes back to him and he is not one that is likely to let it pass
now that's the house you're after that one standing back from the street
you'll find old jacob shafter that runs it as honest a man as lives in this township
i thank you said mcmurdo and shaking hands with his new acquaintance he plodded gripsack in hand up the path which led to the dwelling house at the door of which he gave a resounding knock
it was opened at once by someone very different from what he had expected
it was a woman young and singularly beautiful
she was of the german type blonde and fair haired with the piquant contrast of a pair of beautiful dark eyes with which she surveyed the stranger with surprise and a pleasing embarrassment which brought a wave of colour over her pale face
framed in the bright light of the open doorway it seemed to mcmurdo that he had never seen a more beautiful picture the more attractive for its contrast with the sordid and gloomy surroundings
a lovely violet growing upon one of those black slag heaps of the mines would not have seemed more surprising
so entranced was he that he stood staring without a word and it was she who broke the silence
i thought it was father said she with a pleasing little touch of a german accent
did you come to see him
he is downtown
i expect him back every minute
mcmurdo continued to gaze at her in open admiration until her eyes dropped in confusion before this masterful visitor
no miss he said at last i'm in no hurry to see him
but your house was recommended to me for board
i thought it might suit me and now i know it will
you are quick to make up your mind said she with a smile
anyone but a blind man could do as much the other answered
she laughed at the compliment
come right in sir she said
i'm miss ettie shafter mr
shafter's daughter
my mother's dead and i run the house
you can sit down by the stove in the front room until father comes along ah here he is
so you can fix things with him right away
a heavy elderly man came plodding up the path
in a few words mcmurdo explained his business
a man of the name of murphy had given him the address in chicago
he in turn had had it from someone else
old shafter was quite ready
the stranger made no bones about terms agreed at once to every condition and was apparently fairly flush of money
for seven dollars a week paid in advance he was to have board and lodging
so it was that mcmurdo the self confessed fugitive from justice took up his abode under the roof of the shafters the first step which was to lead to so long and dark a train of events ending in a far distant land
mcmurdo was a man who made his mark quickly
wherever he was the folk around soon knew it
within a week he had become infinitely the most important person at shafter's
there were ten or a dozen boarders there but they were honest foremen or commonplace clerks from the stores of a very different calibre from the young irishman
of an evening when they gathered together his joke was always the readiest his conversation the brightest and his song the best
he was a born boon companion with a magnetism which drew good humour from all around him
and yet he showed again and again as he had shown in the railway carriage a capacity for sudden fierce anger which compelled the respect and even the fear of those who met him
for the law too and all who were connected with it he exhibited a bitter contempt which delighted some and alarmed others of his fellow boarders
from the first he made it evident by his open admiration that the daughter of the house had won his heart from the instant that he had set eyes upon her beauty and her grace
he was no backward suitor
on the second day he told her that he loved her and from then onward he repeated the same story with an absolute disregard of what she might say to discourage him
someone else
he would cry
well the worse luck for someone else
let him look out for himself
am i to lose my life's chance and all my heart's desire for someone else
you can keep on saying no ettie the day will come when you will say yes and i'm young enough to wait
he was a dangerous suitor with his glib irish tongue and his pretty coaxing ways
there was about him also that glamour of experience and of mystery which attracts a woman's interest and finally her love
he could talk of the sweet valleys of county monaghan from which he came of the lovely distant island the low hills and green meadows of which seemed the more beautiful when imagination viewed them from this place of grime and snow
then he was versed in the life of the cities of the north of detroit and the lumber camps of michigan and finally of chicago where he had worked in a planing mill
and afterwards came the hint of romance the feeling that strange things had happened to him in that great city so strange and so intimate that they might not be spoken of
he spoke wistfully of a sudden leaving a breaking of old ties a flight into a strange world ending in this dreary valley and ettie listened her dark eyes gleaming with pity and with sympathy those two qualities which may turn so rapidly and so naturally to love
mcmurdo had obtained a temporary job as bookkeeper for he was a well educated man
this kept him out most of the day and he had not found occasion yet to report himself to the head of the lodge of the eminent order of freemen
he was reminded of his omission however by a visit one evening from mike scanlan the fellow member whom he had met in the train
scanlan the small sharp faced nervous black eyed man seemed glad to see him once more
after a glass or two of whisky he broached the object of his visit
say mcmurdo said he i remembered your address so i made bold to call
i'm surprised that you've not reported to the bodymaster
why haven't you seen boss mcginty yet
well i had to find a job
i have been busy
you must find time for him if you have none for anything else
good lord man
you're a fool not to have been down to the union house and registered your name the first morning after you came here
if you run against him well you mustn't that's all
mcmurdo showed mild surprise
i've been a member of the lodge for over two years scanlan but i never heard that duties were so pressing as all that
maybe not in chicago
well it's the same society here
is it
scanlan looked at him long and fixedly
there was something sinister in his eyes
isn't it
you'll tell me that in a month's time
i hear you had a talk with the patrolmen after i left the train
how did you know that
oh it got about things do get about for good and for bad in this district
well yes
i told the hounds what i thought of them
by the lord you'll be a man after mcginty's heart
what does he hate the police too
scanlan burst out laughing
you go and see him my lad said he as he took his leave
it's not the police but you that he'll hate if you don't
now take a friend's advice and go at once
it chanced that on the same evening mcmurdo had another more pressing interview which urged him in the same direction
it may have been that his attentions to ettie had been more evident than before or that they had gradually obtruded themselves into the slow mind of his good german host but whatever the cause the boarding house keeper beckoned the young man into his private room and started on the subject without any circumlocution
it seems to me mister said he that you are gettin' set on my ettie
ain't that so or am i wrong
yes that is so the young man answered
vell i vant to tell you right now that it ain't no manner of use
there's someone slipped in afore you
she told me so
vell you can lay that she told you truth
but did she tell you who it vas
no i asked her but she wouldn't tell
i dare say not the leetle baggage
perhaps she did not vish to frighten you avay
frighten
mcmurdo was on fire in a moment
ah yes my friend
you need not be ashamed to be frightened of him
it is teddy baldwin
and who the devil is he
he is a boss of scowrers
scowrers
i've heard of them before
it's scowrers here and scowrers there and always in a whisper
what are you all afraid of
who are the scowrers
the boarding house keeper instinctively sank his voice as everyone did who talked about that terrible society
the scowrers said he are the eminent order of freemen
the young man stared
why i am a member of that order myself
you
i vould never have had you in my house if i had known it not if you vere to pay me a hundred dollar a week
what's wrong with the order
it's for charity and good fellowship
the rules say so
maybe in some places
not here
what is it here
it's a murder society that's vat it is
mcmurdo laughed incredulously
how can you prove that
he asked
prove it
are there not fifty murders to prove it
vat about milman and van shorst and the nicholson family and old mr
hyam and little billy james and the others
prove it
is there a man or a voman in this valley vat does not know it
see here
said mcmurdo earnestly
i want you to take back what you've said or else make it good
one or the other you must do before i quit this room
put yourself in my place
here am i a stranger in the town
i belong to a society that i know only as an innocent one
you'll find it through the length and breadth of the states but always as an innocent one
now when i am counting upon joining it here you tell me that it is the same as a murder society called the scowrers
i guess you owe me either an apology or else an explanation mr
shafter
i can but tell you vat the whole vorld knows mister
the bosses of the one are the bosses of the other
if you offend the one it is the other vat vill strike you
we have proved it too often
that's just gossip i want proof
said mcmurdo
if you live here long you vill get your proof
but i forget that you are yourself one of them
you vill soon be as bad as the rest
but you vill find other lodgings mister
i cannot have you here
is it not bad enough that one of these people come courting my ettie and that i dare not turn him down but that i should have another for my boarder
yes indeed you shall not sleep here after to night
mcmurdo found himself under sentence of banishment both from his comfortable quarters and from the girl whom he loved
he found her alone in the sitting room that same evening and he poured his troubles into her ear
sure your father is after giving me notice he said
it's little i would care if it was just my room but indeed ettie though it's only a week that i've known you you are the very breath of life to me and i can't live without you
oh hush mr
mcmurdo don't speak so
said the girl
i have told you have i not that you are too late
there is another and if i have not promised to marry him at once at least i can promise no one else
suppose i had been first ettie would i have had a chance
the girl sank her face into her hands
i wish to heaven that you had been first
she sobbed
mcmurdo was down on his knees before her in an instant
for god's sake ettie let it stand at that
he cried
will you ruin your life and my own for the sake of this promise
follow your heart acushla
'tis a safer guide than any promise before you knew what it was that you were saying
he had seized ettie's white hand between his own strong brown ones
say that you will be mine and we will face it out together
not here
yes here
no no jack
his arms were round her now
it could not be here
could you take me away
a struggle passed for a moment over mcmurdo's face but it ended by setting like granite
no here he said
i'll hold you against the world ettie right here where we are
why should we not leave together
no ettie i can't leave here
but why
i'd never hold my head up again if i felt that i had been driven out
besides what is there to be afraid of
are we not free folks in a free country
if you love me and i you who will dare to come between
you don't know jack
you've been here too short a time
you don't know this baldwin
you don't know mcginty and his scowrers
no i don't know them and i don't fear them and i don't believe in them
said mcmurdo
i've lived among rough men my darling and instead of fearing them it has always ended that they have feared me always ettie
it's mad on the face of it
if these men as your father says have done crime after crime in the valley and if everyone knows them by name how comes it that none are brought to justice
you answer me that ettie
because no witness dares to appear against them
he would not live a month if he did
also because they have always their own men to swear that the accused one was far from the scene of the crime
but surely jack you must have read all this
i had understood that every paper in the united states was writing about it
well i have read something it is true but i had thought it was a story
maybe these men have some reason in what they do
maybe they are wronged and have no other way to help themselves
oh jack don't let me hear you speak so
that is how he speaks the other one
baldwin he speaks like that does he
and that is why i loathe him so
oh jack now i can tell you the truth
i loathe him with all my heart but i fear him also
i fear him for myself but above all i fear him for father
i know that some great sorrow would come upon us if i dared to say what i really felt
that is why i have put him off with half promises
it was in real truth our only hope
but if you would fly with me jack we could take father with us and live forever far from the power of these wicked men
again there was the struggle upon mcmurdo's face and again it set like granite
no harm shall come to you ettie nor to your father either
as to wicked men i expect you may find that i am as bad as the worst of them before we're through
no no jack
i would trust you anywhere
mcmurdo laughed bitterly
good lord
how little you know of me
your innocent soul my darling could not even guess what is passing in mine
but hullo who's the visitor
the door had opened suddenly and a young fellow came swaggering in with the air of one who is the master
he was a handsome dashing young man of about the same age and build as mcmurdo himself
under his broad brimmed black felt hat which he had not troubled to remove a handsome face with fierce domineering eyes and a curved hawk bill of a nose looked savagely at the pair who sat by the stove
ettie had jumped to her feet full of confusion and alarm
i'm glad to see you mr
baldwin said she
you're earlier than i had thought
come and sit down
baldwin stood with his hands on his hips looking at mcmurdo
who is this
he asked curtly
it's a friend of mine mr
baldwin a new boarder here
mr
mcmurdo may i introduce you to mr
baldwin
the young men nodded in surly fashion to each other
maybe miss ettie has told you how it is with us
said baldwin
i didn't understand that there was any relation between you
didn't you
well you can understand it now
you can take it from me that this young lady is mine and you'll find it a very fine evening for a walk
thank you i am in no humour for a walk
aren't you
the man's savage eyes were blazing with anger
maybe you are in a humour for a fight mr
boarder
that i am
cried mcmurdo springing to his feet
you never said a more welcome word
for god's sake jack
oh for god's sake
cried poor distracted ettie
oh jack jack he will hurt you
oh it's jack is it
said baldwin with an oath
you've come to that already have you
oh ted be reasonable be kind
for my sake ted if ever you loved me be big hearted and forgiving
i think ettie that if you were to leave us alone we could get this thing settled said mcmurdo quietly
or maybe mr
baldwin you will take a turn down the street with me
it's a fine evening and there's some open ground beyond the next block
i'll get even with you without needing to dirty my hands said his enemy
you'll wish you had never set foot in this house before i am through with you
no time like the present cried mcmurdo
i'll choose my own time mister
you can leave the time to me
see here
he suddenly rolled up his sleeve and showed upon his forearm a peculiar sign which appeared to have been branded there
it was a circle with a triangle within it
d'you know what that means
i neither know nor care
well you will know i'll promise you that
you won't be much older either
perhaps miss ettie can tell you something about it
as to you ettie you'll come back to me on your knees d'ye hear girl on your knees and then i'll tell you what your punishment may be
you've sowed and by the lord i'll see that you reap
he glanced at them both in fury
then he turned upon his heel and an instant later the outer door had banged behind him
for a few moments mcmurdo and the girl stood in silence
then she threw her arms around him
oh jack how brave you were
but it is no use you must fly
to night jack to night
it's your only hope
he will have your life
i read it in his horrible eyes
what chance have you against a dozen of them with boss mcginty and all the power of the lodge behind them
mcmurdo disengaged her hands kissed her and gently pushed her back into a chair
there acushla there
don't be disturbed or fear for me
i'm a freeman myself
i'm after telling your father about it
maybe i am no better than the others so don't make a saint of me
perhaps you hate me too now that i've told you as much
hate you jack
while life lasts i could never do that
i've heard that there is no harm in being a freeman anywhere but here so why should i think the worse of you for that
but if you are a freeman jack why should you not go down and make a friend of boss mcginty
oh hurry jack hurry
get your word in first or the hounds will be on your trail
i was thinking the same thing said mcmurdo
i'll go right now and fix it
you can tell your father that i'll sleep here to night and find some other quarters in the morning
the bar of mcginty's saloon was crowded as usual for it was the favourite loafing place of all the rougher elements of the town
the man was popular for he had a rough jovial disposition which formed a mask covering a great deal which lay behind it
but apart from this popularity the fear in which he was held throughout the township and indeed down the whole thirty miles of the valley and past the mountains on each side of it was enough in itself to fill his bar for none could afford to neglect his good will
besides those secret powers which it was universally believed that he exercised in so pitiless a fashion he was a high public official a municipal councillor and a commissioner of roads elected to the office through the votes of the ruffians who in turn expected to receive favours at his hands
assessments and taxes were enormous the public works were notoriously neglected the accounts were slurred over by bribed auditors and the decent citizen was terrorized into paying public blackmail and holding his tongue lest some worse thing befall him
thus it was that year by year boss mcginty's diamond pins became more obtrusive his gold chains more weighty across a more gorgeous vest and his saloon stretched farther and farther until it threatened to absorb one whole side of the market square
mcmurdo pushed open the swinging door of the saloon and made his way amid the crowd of men within through an atmosphere blurred with tobacco smoke and heavy with the smell of spirits
the place was brilliantly lighted and the huge heavily gilt mirrors upon every wall reflected and multiplied the garish illumination
there were several bartenders in their shirt sleeves hard at work mixing drinks for the loungers who fringed the broad brass trimmed counter
at the far end with his body resting upon the bar and a cigar stuck at an acute angle from the corner of his mouth stood a tall strong heavily built man who could be none other than the famous mcginty himself
he was a black maned giant bearded to the cheek bones and with a shock of raven hair which fell to his collar
his complexion was as swarthy as that of an italian and his eyes were of a strange dead black which combined with a slight squint gave them a particularly sinister appearance
all else in the man his noble proportions his fine features and his frank bearing fitted in with that jovial man to man manner which he affected
here one would say is a bluff honest fellow whose heart would be sound however rude his outspoken words might seem
it was only when those dead dark eyes deep and remorseless were turned upon a man that he shrank within himself feeling that he was face to face with an infinite possibility of latent evil with a strength and courage and cunning behind it which made it a thousand times more deadly
having had a good look at his man mcmurdo elbowed his way forward with his usual careless audacity and pushed himself through the little group of courtiers who were fawning upon the powerful boss laughing uproariously at the smallest of his jokes
the young stranger's bold gray eyes looked back fearlessly through their glasses at the deadly black ones which turned sharply upon him
well young man i can't call your face to mind
i'm new here mr
mcginty
you are not so new that you can't give a gentleman his proper title
he's councillor mcginty young man said a voice from the group
i'm sorry councillor
i'm strange to the ways of the place
but i was advised to see you
well you see me
this is all there is
what d'you think of me
well it's early days
if your heart is as big as your body and your soul as fine as your face then i'd ask for nothing better said mcmurdo
by gar
you've got an irish tongue in your head anyhow cried the saloon keeper not quite certain whether to humour this audacious visitor or to stand upon his dignity
so you are good enough to pass my appearance
sure said mcmurdo
and you were told to see me
i was
and who told you
brother scanlan of lodge vermissa
i drink your health councillor and to our better acquaintance
he raised a glass with which he had been served to his lips and elevated his little finger as he drank it
mcginty who had been watching him narrowly raised his thick black eyebrows
oh it's like that is it
said he
i'll have to look a bit closer into this mister mcmurdo
a bit closer mr
mcmurdo for we don't take folk on trust in these parts nor believe all we're told neither
come in here for a moment behind the bar
there was a small room there lined with barrels
mcginty carefully closed the door and then seated himself on one of them biting thoughtfully on his cigar and surveying his companion with those disquieting eyes
for a couple of minutes he sat in complete silence
mcmurdo bore the inspection cheerfully one hand in his coat pocket the other twisting his brown moustache
suddenly mcginty stooped and produced a wicked looking revolver
see here my joker said he if i thought you were playing any game on us it would be short work for you
this is a strange welcome mcmurdo answered with some dignity for the bodymaster of a lodge of freemen to give to a stranger brother
ay but it's just that same that you have to prove said mcginty and god help you if you fail
where were you made
lodge chicago
when
june
what bodymaster
james h
scott
who is your district ruler
bartholomew wilson
hum
you seem glib enough in your tests
what are you doing here
working the same as you but a poorer job
you have your back answer quick enough
yes i was always quick of speech
are you quick of action
i have had that name among those that knew me best
well we may try you sooner than you think
have you heard anything of the lodge in these parts
i've heard that it takes a man to be a brother
true for you mr
mcmurdo
why did you leave chicago
i'm damned if i tell you that
mcginty opened his eyes
he was not used to being answered in such fashion and it amused him
why won't you tell me
because no brother may tell another a lie
then the truth is too bad to tell
you can put it that way if you like
see here mister you can't expect me as bodymaster to pass into the lodge a man for whose past he can't answer
mcmurdo looked puzzled
then he took a worn newspaper cutting from an inner pocket
you wouldn't squeal on a fellow
said he
i'll wipe my hand across your face if you say such words to me
cried mcginty hotly
you are right councillor said mcmurdo meekly
i should apologize
i spoke without thought
well i know that i am safe in your hands
look at that clipping
mcginty glanced his eyes over the account of the shooting of one jonas pinto in the lake saloon market street chicago in the new year week of
your work
he asked as he handed back the paper
mcmurdo nodded
why did you shoot him
i was helping uncle sam to make dollars
maybe mine were not as good gold as his but they looked as well and were cheaper to make
this man pinto helped me to shove the queer to do what
well it means to pass the dollars out into circulation
then he said he would split
maybe he did split
i didn't wait to see
i just killed him and lighted out for the coal country
why the coal country
'cause i'd read in the papers that they weren't too particular in those parts
mcginty laughed
you were first a coiner and then a murderer and you came to these parts because you thought you'd be welcome
that's about the size of it mcmurdo answered
well i guess you'll go far
say can you make those dollars yet
mcmurdo took half a dozen from his pocket
those never passed the philadelphia mint said he
you don't say
mcginty held them to the light in his enormous hand which was hairy as a gorilla's
i can see no difference
gar
you'll be a mighty useful brother i'm thinking
we can do with a bad man or two among us friend mcmurdo for there are times when we have to take our own part
we'd soon be against the wall if we didn't shove back at those that were pushing us
well i guess i'll do my share of shoving with the rest of the boys
you seem to have a good nerve
you didn't squirm when i shoved this gun at you
it was not me that was in danger
who then
it was you councillor
mcmurdo drew a cocked pistol from the side pocket of his peajacket
i was covering you all the time
i guess my shot would have been as quick as yours
by gar
mcginty flushed an angry red and then burst into a roar of laughter
say we've had no such holy terror come to hand this many a year
i reckon the lodge will learn to be proud of you well what the hell do you want
and can't i speak alone with a gentleman for five minutes but you must butt in on us
the bartender stood abashed
i'm sorry councillor but it's ted baldwin
he says he must see you this very minute
the message was unnecessary for the set cruel face of the man himself was looking over the servant's shoulder
he pushed the bartender out and closed the door on him
so said he with a furious glance at mcmurdo you got here first did you
i've a word to say to you councillor about this man
then say it here and now before my face cried mcmurdo
i'll say it at my own time in my own way
tut
tut
said mcginty getting off his barrel
this will never do
we have a new brother here baldwin and it's not for us to greet him in such fashion
hold out your hand man and make it up
never
cried baldwin in a fury
i've offered to fight him if he thinks i have wronged him said mcmurdo
i'll fight him with fists or if that won't satisfy him i'll fight him any other way he chooses
now i'll leave it to you councillor to judge between us as a bodymaster should
what is it then
a young lady
she's free to choose for herself
is she
cried baldwin
as between two brothers of the lodge i should say that she was said the boss
oh that's your ruling is it
yes it is ted baldwin said mcginty with a wicked stare
is it you that would dispute it
you would throw over one that has stood by you this five years in favour of a man that you never saw before in your life
you're not bodymaster for life jack mcginty and by god
when next it comes to a vote the councillor sprang at him like a tiger
his hand closed round the other's neck and he hurled him back across one of the barrels
in his mad fury he would have squeezed the life out of him if mcmurdo had not interfered
easy councillor
for heaven's sake go easy
he cried as he dragged him back
mcginty released his hold and baldwin cowed and shaken gasping for breath and shivering in every limb as one who has looked over the very edge of death sat up on the barrel over which he had been hurled
you've been asking for it this many a day ted baldwin now you've got it
cried mcginty his huge chest rising and falling
maybe you think if i was voted down from bodymaster you would find yourself in my shoes
it's for the lodge to say that
but so long as i am the chief i'll have no man lift his voice against me or my rulings
i have nothing against you mumbled baldwin feeling his throat
well then cried the other relapsing in a moment into a bluff joviality we are all good friends again and there's an end of the matter
he took a bottle of champagne down from the shelf and twisted out the cork
see now he continued as he filled three high glasses
let us drink the quarrelling toast of the lodge
after that as you know there can be no bad blood between us
now then the left hand on the apple of my throat
i say to you ted baldwin what is the offense sir
the clouds are heavy answered baldwin but they will forever brighten
and this i swear
the men drank their glasses and the same ceremony was performed between baldwin and mcmurdo
there
cried mcginty rubbing his hands
that's the end of the black blood
you come under lodge discipline if it goes further and that's a heavy hand in these parts as brother baldwin knows and as you will damn soon find out brother mcmurdo if you ask for trouble
faith i'd be slow to do that said mcmurdo
he held out his hand to baldwin
i'm quick to quarrel and quick to forgive
it's my hot irish blood they tell me
but it's over for me and i bear no grudge
baldwin had to take the proffered hand for the baleful eye of the terrible boss was upon him
but his sullen face showed how little the words of the other had moved him
mcginty clapped them both on the shoulders
tut
these girls
these girls
he cried
to think that the same petticoats should come between two of my boys
it's the devil's own luck
well it's the colleen inside of them that must settle the question for it's outside the jurisdiction of a bodymaster and the lord be praised for that
we have enough on us without the women as well
you'll have to be affiliated to lodge brother mcmurdo
we have our own ways and methods different from chicago
saturday night is our meeting and if you come then we'll make you free forever of the vermissa valley
on the day following the evening which had contained so many exciting events mcmurdo moved his lodgings from old jacob shafter's and took up his quarters at the widow macnamara's on the extreme outskirts of the town
scanlan his original acquaintance aboard the train had occasion shortly afterwards to move into vermissa and the two lodged together
there was no other boarder and the hostess was an easy going old irishwoman who left them to themselves so that they had a freedom for speech and action welcome to men who had secrets in common
shafter had relented to the extent of letting mcmurdo come to his meals there when he liked so that his intercourse with ettie was by no means broken
on the contrary it drew closer and more intimate as the weeks went by
in his bedroom at his new abode mcmurdo felt it safe to take out the coining moulds and under many a pledge of secrecy a number of brothers from the lodge were allowed to come in and see them each carrying away in his pocket some examples of the false money so cunningly struck that there was never the slightest difficulty or danger in passing it
why with such a wonderful art at his command mcmurdo should condescend to work at all was a perpetual mystery to his companions though he made it clear to anyone who asked him that if he lived without any visible means it would very quickly bring the police upon his track
one policeman was indeed after him already but the incident as luck would have it did the adventurer a great deal more good than harm
after the first introduction there were few evenings when he did not find his way to mcginty's saloon there to make closer acquaintance with the boys which was the jovial title by which the dangerous gang who infested the place were known to one another
his dashing manner and fearlessness of speech made him a favourite with them all while the rapid and scientific way in which he polished off his antagonist in an all in bar room scrap earned the respect of that rough community
another incident however raised him even higher in their estimation
just at the crowded hour one night the door opened and a man entered with the quiet blue uniform and peaked cap of the mine police
this was a special body raised by the railways and colliery owners to supplement the efforts of the ordinary civil police who were perfectly helpless in the face of the organized ruffianism which terrorized the district
there was a hush as he entered and many a curious glance was cast at him but the relations between policemen and criminals are peculiar in some parts of the states and mcginty himself standing behind his counter showed no surprise when the policeman enrolled himself among his customers
a straight whisky for the night is bitter said the police officer
i don't think we have met before councillor
you'll be the new captain
said mcginty
that's so
we're looking to you councillor and to the other leading citizens to help us in upholding law and order in this township
captain marvin is my name
we'd do better without you captain marvin said mcginty coldly for we have our own police of the township and no need for any imported goods
what are you but the paid tool of the capitalists hired by them to club or shoot your poorer fellow citizen
well well we won't argue about that said the police officer good humouredly
i expect we all do our duty same as we see it but we can't all see it the same
he had drunk off his glass and had turned to go when his eyes fell upon the face of jack mcmurdo who was scowling at his elbow
hullo
hullo
he cried looking him up and down
here's an old acquaintance
mcmurdo shrank away from him
i was never a friend to you nor any other cursed copper in my life said he
an acquaintance isn't always a friend said the police captain grinning
you're jack mcmurdo of chicago right enough and don't you deny it
mcmurdo shrugged his shoulders
i'm not denying it said he
d'ye think i'm ashamed of my own name
you've got good cause to be anyhow
what the devil d'you mean by that
he roared with his fists clenched
no no jack bluster won't do with me
i was an officer in chicago before ever i came to this darned coal bunker and i know a chicago crook when i see one
mcmurdo's face fell
don't tell me that you're marvin of the chicago central
he cried
just the same old teddy marvin at your service
we haven't forgotten the shooting of jonas pinto up there
i never shot him
did you not
that's good impartial evidence ain't it
well his death came in uncommon handy for you or they would have had you for shoving the queer
well we can let that be bygones for between you and me and perhaps i'm going further than my duty in saying it they could get no clear case against you and chicago's open to you to morrow
i'm very well where i am
well i've given you the pointer and you're a sulky dog not to thank me for it
well i suppose you mean well and i do thank you said mcmurdo in no very gracious manner
it's mum with me so long as i see you living on the straight said the captain
but by the lord
if you get off after this it's another story
so good night to you and goodnight councillor
he left the bar room but not before he had created a local hero
mcmurdo's deeds in far chicago had been whispered before
he had put off all questions with a smile as one who did not wish to have greatness thrust upon him
but now the thing was officially confirmed
the bar loafers crowded round him and shook him heartily by the hand
he was free of the community from that time on
he could drink hard and show little trace of it but that evening had his mate scanlan not been at hand to lead him home the feted hero would surely have spent his night under the bar
on a saturday night mcmurdo was introduced to the lodge
he had thought to pass in without ceremony as being an initiate of chicago but there were particular rites in vermissa of which they were proud and these had to be undergone by every postulant
the assembly met in a large room reserved for such purposes at the union house
some sixty members assembled at vermissa but that by no means represented the full strength of the organization for there were several other lodges in the valley and others across the mountains on each side who exchanged members when any serious business was afoot so that a crime might be done by men who were strangers to the locality
altogether there were not less than five hundred scattered over the coal district
in the bare assembly room the men were gathered round a long table
at the side was a second one laden with bottles and glasses on which some members of the company were already turning their eyes
mcginty sat at the head with a flat black velvet cap upon his shock of tangled black hair and a coloured purple stole round his neck so that he seemed to be a priest presiding over some diabolical ritual
to right and left of him were the higher lodge officials the cruel handsome face of ted baldwin among them
each of these wore some scarf or medallion as emblem of his office
they were for the most part men of mature age but the rest of the company consisted of young fellows from eighteen to twenty five the ready and capable agents who carried out the commands of their seniors
among the older men were many whose features showed the tigerish lawless souls within but looking at the rank and file it was difficult to believe that these eager and open faced young fellows were in very truth a dangerous gang of murderers whose minds had suffered such complete moral perversion that they took a horrible pride in their proficiency at the business and looked with deepest respect at the man who had the reputation of making what they called a clean job
to their contorted natures it had become a spirited and chivalrous thing to volunteer for service against some man who had never injured them and whom in many cases they had never seen in their lives
the crime committed they quarrelled as to who had actually struck the fatal blow and amused one another and the company by describing the cries and contortions of the murdered man
at first they had shown some secrecy in their arrangements but at the time which this narrative describes their proceedings were extraordinarily open for the repeated failures of the law had proved to them that on the one hand no one would dare to witness against them and on the other they had an unlimited number of stanch witnesses upon whom they could call and a well filled treasure chest from which they could draw the funds to engage the best legal talent in the state
in ten long years of outrage there had been no single conviction and the only danger that ever threatened the scowrers lay in the victim himself who however outnumbered and taken by surprise might and occasionally did leave his mark upon his assailants
mcmurdo had been warned that some ordeal lay before him but no one would tell him in what it consisted
he was led now into an outer room by two solemn brothers
through the plank partition he could hear the murmur of many voices from the assembly within
once or twice he caught the sound of his own name and he knew that they were discussing his candidacy
then there entered an inner guard with a green and gold sash across his chest
the bodymaster orders that he shall be trussed blinded and entered said he
the three of them removed his coat turned up the sleeve of his right arm and finally passed a rope round above the elbows and made it fast
they next placed a thick black cap right over his head and the upper part of his face so that he could see nothing
he was then led into the assembly hall
it was pitch dark and very oppressive under his hood
he heard the rustle and murmur of the people round him and then the voice of mcginty sounded dull and distant through the covering of his ears
john mcmurdo said the voice are you already a member of the ancient order of freemen
he bowed in assent
is your lodge no
chicago
he bowed again
dark nights are unpleasant said the voice
yes for strangers to travel he answered
the clouds are heavy
yes a storm is approaching
are the brethren satisfied
asked the bodymaster
there was a general murmur of assent
we know brother by your sign and by your countersign that you are indeed one of us said mcginty
we would have you know however that in this county and in other counties of these parts we have certain rites and also certain duties of our own which call for good men
are you ready to be tested
i am
are you of stout heart
i am
take a stride forward to prove it
as the words were said he felt two hard points in front of his eyes pressing upon them so that it appeared as if he could not move forward without a danger of losing them
none the less he nerved himself to step resolutely out and as he did so the pressure melted away
there was a low murmur of applause
he is of stout heart said the voice
can you bear pain
as well as another he answered
test him
it was all he could do to keep himself from screaming out for an agonizing pain shot through his forearm
he nearly fainted at the sudden shock of it but he bit his lip and clenched his hands to hide his agony
i can take more than that said he
this time there was loud applause
a finer first appearance had never been made in the lodge
hands clapped him on the back and the hood was plucked from his head
he stood blinking and smiling amid the congratulations of the brothers
one last word brother mcmurdo said mcginty
you have already sworn the oath of secrecy and fidelity and you are aware that the punishment for any breach of it is instant and inevitable death
i am said mcmurdo
and you accept the rule of the bodymaster for the time being under all circumstances
i do
then in the name of lodge vermissa i welcome you to its privileges and debates
you will put the liquor on the table brother scanlan and we will drink to our worthy brother
mcmurdo's coat had been brought to him but before putting it on he examined his right arm which still smarted heavily
there on the flesh of the forearm was a circle with a triangle within it deep and red as the branding iron had left it
one or two of his neighbours pulled up their sleeves and showed their own lodge marks
we've all had it said one but not all as brave as you over it
tut
it was nothing said he but it burned and ached all the same
when the drinks which followed the ceremony of initiation had all been disposed of the business of the lodge proceeded
mcmurdo accustomed only to the prosaic performances of chicago listened with open ears and more surprise than he ventured to show to what followed
the first business on the agenda paper said mcginty is to read the following letter from division master windle of merton county lodge
he says dear sir there is a job to be done on andrew rae of rae sturmash coal owners near this place
you will remember that your lodge owes us a return having had the service of two brethren in the matter of the patrolman last fall
you will send two good men they will be taken charge of by treasurer higgins of this lodge whose address you know
he will show them when to act and where
yours in freedom j w windle d m a o f
windle has never refused us when we have had occasion to ask for the loan of a man or two and it is not for us to refuse him
mcginty paused and looked round the room with his dull malevolent eyes
who will volunteer for the job
several young fellows held up their hands
the bodymaster looked at them with an approving smile
you'll do tiger cormac
if you handle it as well as you did the last you won't be wrong
and you wilson
i've no pistol said the volunteer a mere boy in his teens
it's your first is it not
well you have to be blooded some time
it will be a great start for you
as to the pistol you'll find it waiting for you or i'm mistaken
if you report yourselves on monday it will be time enough
you'll get a great welcome when you return
any reward this time
asked cormac a thick set dark faced brutal looking young man whose ferocity had earned him the nickname of tiger
never mind the reward
you just do it for the honour of the thing
maybe when it is done there will be a few odd dollars at the bottom of the box
what has the man done
asked young wilson
sure it's not for the likes of you to ask what the man has done
he has been judged over there
that's no business of ours
all we have to do is to carry it out for them same as they would for us
speaking of that two brothers from the merton lodge are coming over to us next week to do some business in this quarter
who are they
asked someone
faith it is wiser not to ask
if you know nothing you can testify nothing and no trouble can come of it
but they are men who will make a clean job when they are about it
and time too
cried ted baldwin
folk are gettin' out of hand in these parts
it was only last week that three of our men were turned off by foreman blaker
it's been owing him a long time and he'll get it full and proper
get what
mcmurdo whispered to his neighbour
the business end of a buckshot cartridge
cried the man with a loud laugh
what think you of our ways brother
mcmurdo's criminal soul seemed to have already absorbed the spirit of the vile association of which he was now a member
i like it well said he
'tis a proper place for a lad of mettle
several of those who sat around heard his words and applauded them
what's that
cried the black maned bodymaster from the end of the table
'tis our new brother sir who finds our ways to his taste
mcmurdo rose to his feet for an instant
i would say eminent bodymaster that if a man should be wanted i should take it as an honour to be chosen to help the lodge
there was great applause at this
it was felt that a new sun was pushing its rim above the horizon
to some of the elders it seemed that the progress was a little too rapid
i would move said the secretary harraway a vulture faced old graybeard who sat near the chairman that brother mcmurdo should wait until it is the good pleasure of the lodge to employ him
sure that was what i meant i'm in your hands said mcmurdo
your time will come brother said the chairman
we have marked you down as a willing man and we believe that you will do good work in these parts
there is a small matter to night in which you may take a hand if it so please you
i will wait for something that is worth while
you can come to night anyhow and it will help you to know what we stand for in this community
i will make the announcement later
meanwhile he glanced at his agenda paper i have one or two more points to bring before the meeting
first of all i will ask the treasurer as to our bank balance
there is the pension to jim carnaway's widow
he was struck down doing the work of the lodge and it is for us to see that she is not the loser
jim was shot last month when they tried to kill chester wilcox of marley creek mcmurdo's neighbour informed him
the funds are good at the moment said the treasurer with the bankbook in front of him
the firms have been generous of late
max linder co
paid five hundred to be left alone
walker brothers sent in a hundred but i took it on myself to return it and ask for five
if i do not hear by wednesday their winding gear may get out of order
we had to burn their breaker last year before they became reasonable
then the west section coaling company has paid its annual contribution
we have enough on hand to meet any obligations
what about archie swindon
asked a brother
he has sold out and left the district
the old devil left a note for us to say that he had rather be a free crossing sweeper in new york than a large mine owner under the power of a ring of blackmailers
by gar
it was as well that he made a break for it before the note reached us
i guess he won't show his face in this valley again
an elderly clean shaved man with a kindly face and a good brow rose from the end of the table which faced the chairman
mr
treasurer he asked may i ask who has bought the property of this man that we have driven out of the district
yes brother morris
it has been bought by the state merton county railroad company
and who bought the mines of todman and of lee that came into the market in the same way last year
the same company brother morris
and who bought the ironworks of manson and of shuman and of van deher and of atwood which have all been given up of late
they were all bought by the west gilmerton general mining company
i don't see brother morris said the chairman that it matters to us who buys them since they can't carry them out of the district
with all respect to you eminent bodymaster i think it may matter very much to us
this process has been going on now for ten long years
we are gradually driving all the small men out of trade
what is the result
we find in their places great companies like the railroad or the general iron who have their directors in new york or philadelphia and care nothing for our threats
we can take it out of their local bosses but it only means that others will be sent in their stead
and we are making it dangerous for ourselves
the small men could not harm us
they had not the money nor the power
so long as we did not squeeze them too dry they would stay on under our power
but if these big companies find that we stand between them and their profits they will spare no pains and no expense to hunt us down and bring us to court
there was a hush at these ominous words and every face darkened as gloomy looks were exchanged
so omnipotent and unchallenged had they been that the very thought that there was possible retribution in the background had been banished from their minds
and yet the idea struck a chill to the most reckless of them
it is my advice the speaker continued that we go easier upon the small men
on the day that they have all been driven out the power of this society will have been broken
unwelcome truths are not popular
there were angry cries as the speaker resumed his seat
mcginty rose with gloom upon his brow
brother morris said he you were always a croaker
so long as the members of this lodge stand together there is no power in the united states that can touch them
sure have we not tried it often enough in the law courts
i expect the big companies will find it easier to pay than to fight same as the little companies do
and now brethren mcginty took off his black velvet cap and his stole as he spoke this lodge has finished its business for the evening save for one small matter which may be mentioned when we are parting
the time has now come for fraternal refreshment and for harmony
strange indeed is human nature
here were these men to whom murder was familiar who again and again had struck down the father of the family some man against whom they had no personal feeling without one thought of compunction or of compassion for his weeping wife or helpless children and yet the tender or pathetic in music could move them to tears
mcmurdo had a fine tenor voice and if he had failed to gain the good will of the lodge before it could no longer have been withheld after he had thrilled them with i'm sitting on the stile mary and on the banks of allan water
in his very first night the new recruit had made himself one of the most popular of the brethren marked already for advancement and high office
there were other qualities needed however besides those of good fellowship to make a worthy freeman and of these he was given an example before the evening was over
the whisky bottle had passed round many times and the men were flushed and ripe for mischief when their bodymaster rose once more to address them
boys said he there's one man in this town that wants trimming up and it's for you to see that he gets it
i'm speaking of james stanger of the herald
you've seen how he's been opening his mouth against us again
there was a murmur of assent with many a muttered oath
mcginty took a slip of paper from his waistcoat pocket
law and order
that's how he heads it
reign of terror in the coal and iron district twelve years have now elapsed since the first assassinations which proved the existence of a criminal organization in our midst
from that day these outrages have never ceased until now they have reached a pitch which makes us the opprobrium of the civilized world
is it for such results as this that our great country welcomes to its bosom the alien who flies from the despotisms of europe
is it that they shall themselves become tyrants over the very men who have given them shelter and that a state of terrorism and lawlessness should be established under the very shadow of the sacred folds of the starry flag of freedom which would raise horror in our minds if we read of it as existing under the most effete monarchy of the east
the men are known
the organization is patent and public
how long are we to endure it
can we forever live sure i've read enough of the slush
cried the chairman tossing the paper down upon the table
that's what he says of us
the question i'm asking you is what shall we say to him
kill him
cried a dozen fierce voices
i protest against that said brother morris the man of the good brow and shaved face
i tell you brethren that our hand is too heavy in this valley and that there will come a point where in self defense every man will unite to crush us out
james stanger is an old man
he is respected in the township and the district
his paper stands for all that is solid in the valley
if that man is struck down there will be a stir through this state that will only end with our destruction
and how would they bring about our destruction mr
standback
cried mcginty
is it by the police
sure half of them are in our pay and half of them afraid of us
or is it by the law courts and the judge
haven't we tried that before now and what ever came of it
there is a judge lynch that might try the case said brother morris
a general shout of anger greeted the suggestion
i have but to raise my finger cried mcginty and i could put two hundred men into this town that would clear it out from end to end
then suddenly raising his voice and bending his huge black brows into a terrible frown see here brother morris i have my eye on you and have had for some time
you've no heart yourself and you try to take the heart out of others
it will be an ill day for you brother morris when your own name comes on our agenda paper and i'm thinking that it's just there that i ought to place it
morris had turned deadly pale and his knees seemed to give way under him as he fell back into his chair
he raised his glass in his trembling hand and drank before he could answer
i apologize eminent bodymaster to you and to every brother in this lodge if i have said more than i should
i am a faithful member you all know that and it is my fear lest evil come to the lodge which makes me speak in anxious words
but i have greater trust in your judgment than in my own eminent bodymaster and i promise you that i will not offend again
the bodymaster's scowl relaxed as he listened to the humble words
very good brother morris
it's myself that would be sorry if it were needful to give you a lesson
but so long as i am in this chair we shall be a united lodge in word and in deed
and now boys he continued looking round at the company i'll say this much that if stanger got his full deserts there would be more trouble than we need ask for
these editors hang together and every journal in the state would be crying out for police and troops
but i guess you can give him a pretty severe warning
will you fix it brother baldwin
sure
said the young man eagerly
how many will you take
half a dozen and two to guard the door
you'll come gower and you mansel and you scanlan and the two willabys
i promised the new brother he should go said the chairman
ted baldwin looked at mcmurdo with eyes which showed that he had not forgotten nor forgiven
well he can come if he wants he said in a surly voice
that's enough
the sooner we get to work the better
the company broke up with shouts and yells and snatches of drunken song
the bar was still crowded with revellers and many of the brethren remained there
the little band who had been told off for duty passed out into the street proceeding in twos and threes along the sidewalk so as not to provoke attention
it was a bitterly cold night with a half moon shining brilliantly in a frosty star spangled sky
the men stopped and gathered in a yard which faced a high building
the words vermissa herald were printed in gold lettering between the brightly lit windows
from within came the clanking of the printing press
here you said baldwin to mcmurdo you can stand below at the door and see that the road is kept open for us
arthur willaby can stay with you
you others come with me
have no fears boys for we have a dozen witnesses that we are in the union bar at this very moment
it was nearly midnight and the street was deserted save for one or two revellers upon their way home
the party crossed the road and pushing open the door of the newspaper office baldwin and his men rushed in and up the stair which faced them
mcmurdo and another remained below
from the room above came a shout a cry for help and then the sound of trampling feet and of falling chairs
an instant later a gray haired man rushed out on the landing
he was seized before he could get farther and his spectacles came tinkling down to mcmurdo's feet
there was a thud and a groan
he was on his face and half a dozen sticks were clattering together as they fell upon him
he writhed and his long thin limbs quivered under the blows
the others ceased at last but baldwin his cruel face set in an infernal smile was hacking at the man's head which he vainly endeavoured to defend with his arms
his white hair was dabbled with patches of blood
baldwin was still stooping over his victim putting in a short vicious blow whenever he could see a part exposed when mcmurdo dashed up the stair and pushed him back
you'll kill the man said he
drop it
baldwin looked at him in amazement
curse you
he cried
who are you to interfere you that are new to the lodge
stand back
he raised his stick but mcmurdo had whipped his pistol out of his hip pocket
stand back yourself
he cried
i'll blow your face in if you lay a hand on me
as to the lodge wasn't it the order of the bodymaster that the man was not to be killed and what are you doing but killing him
it's truth he says remarked one of the men
by gar
you'd best hurry yourselves
cried the man below
the windows are all lighting up and you'll have the whole town here inside of five minutes
there was indeed the sound of shouting in the street and a little group of compositors and pressmen was forming in the hall below and nerving itself to action
leaving the limp and motionless body of the editor at the head of the stair the criminals rushed down and made their way swiftly along the street
having reached the union house some of them mixed with the crowd in mcginty's saloon whispering across the bar to the boss that the job had been well carried through
others and among them mcmurdo broke away into side streets and so by devious paths to their own homes
when mcmurdo awoke next morning he had good reason to remember his initiation into the lodge
his head ached with the effect of the drink and his arm where he had been branded was hot and swollen
having his own peculiar source of income he was irregular in his attendance at his work so he had a late breakfast and remained at home for the morning writing a long letter to a friend
afterwards he read the daily herald
in a special column put in at the last moment he read outrage at the herald office editor seriously injured
it was a short account of the facts with which he was himself more familiar than the writer could have been
it ended with the statement the matter is now in the hands of the police but it can hardly be hoped that their exertions will be attended by any better results than in the past
some of the men were recognized and there is hope that a conviction may be obtained
the source of the outrage was it need hardly be said that infamous society which has held this community in bondage for so long a period and against which the herald has taken so uncompromising a stand
mr
stanger's many friends will rejoice to hear that though he has been cruelly and brutally beaten and though he has sustained severe injuries about the head there is no immediate danger to his life
below it stated that a guard of police armed with winchester rifles had been requisitioned for the defense of the office
mcmurdo had laid down the paper and was lighting his pipe with a hand which was shaky from the excesses of the previous evening when there was a knock outside and his landlady brought to him a note which had just been handed in by a lad
it was unsigned and ran thus i should wish to speak to you but would rather not do so in your house
you will find me beside the flagstaff upon miller hill
if you will come there now i have something which it is important for you to hear and for me to say
mcmurdo read the note twice with the utmost surprise for he could not imagine what it meant or who was the author of it
had it been in a feminine hand he might have imagined that it was the beginning of one of those adventures which had been familiar enough in his past life
but it was the writing of a man and of a well educated one too
finally after some hesitation he determined to see the matter through
miller hill is an ill kept public park in the very centre of the town
in summer it is a favourite resort of the people but in winter it is desolate enough
from the top of it one has a view not only of the whole straggling grimy town but of the winding valley beneath with its scattered mines and factories blackening the snow on each side of it and of the wooded and white capped ranges flanking it
mcmurdo strolled up the winding path hedged in with evergreens until he reached the deserted restaurant which forms the centre of summer gaiety
beside it was a bare flagstaff and underneath it a man his hat drawn down and the collar of his overcoat turned up
when he turned his face mcmurdo saw that it was brother morris he who had incurred the anger of the bodymaster the night before
the lodge sign was given and exchanged as they met
i wanted to have a word with you mr
mcmurdo said the older man speaking with a hesitation which showed that he was on delicate ground
it was kind of you to come
why did you not put your name to the note
one has to be cautious mister
one never knows in times like these how a thing may come back to one
one never knows either who to trust or who not to trust
surely one may trust brothers of the lodge
no no not always cried morris with vehemence
whatever we say even what we think seems to go back to that man mcginty
look here
said mcmurdo sternly
it was only last night as you know well that i swore good faith to our bodymaster
would you be asking me to break my oath
if that is the view you take said morris sadly i can only say that i am sorry i gave you the trouble to come and meet me
things have come to a bad pass when two free citizens cannot speak their thoughts to each other
mcmurdo who had been watching his companion very narrowly relaxed somewhat in his bearing
sure i spoke for myself only said he
i am a newcomer as you know and i am strange to it all
it is not for me to open my mouth mr
morris and if you think well to say anything to me i am here to hear it
and to take it back to boss mcginty
said morris bitterly
indeed then you do me injustice there cried mcmurdo
for myself i am loyal to the lodge and so i tell you straight but i would be a poor creature if i were to repeat to any other what you might say to me in confidence
it will go no further than me though i warn you that you may get neither help nor sympathy
i have given up looking for either the one or the other said morris
i may be putting my very life in your hands by what i say but bad as you are and it seemed to me last night that you were shaping to be as bad as the worst still you are new to it and your conscience cannot yet be as hardened as theirs
that was why i thought to speak with you
well what have you to say
if you give me away may a curse be on you
sure i said i would not
i would ask you then when you joined the freeman's society in chicago and swore vows of charity and fidelity did ever it cross your mind that you might find it would lead you to crime
if you call it crime mcmurdo answered
call it crime
cried morris his voice vibrating with passion
you have seen little of it if you can call it anything else
was it crime last night when a man old enough to be your father was beaten till the blood dripped from his white hairs
was that crime or what else would you call it
there are some would say it was war said mcmurdo a war of two classes with all in so that each struck as best it could
well did you think of such a thing when you joined the freeman's society at chicago
no i'm bound to say i did not
nor did i when i joined it at philadelphia
it was just a benefit club and a meeting place for one's fellows
then i heard of this place curse the hour that the name first fell upon my ears and i came to better myself
my god
to better myself
my wife and three children came with me
i started a dry goods store on market square and i prospered well
the word had gone round that i was a freeman and i was forced to join the local lodge same as you did last night
i've the badge of shame on my forearm and something worse branded on my heart
i found that i was under the orders of a black villain and caught in a meshwork of crime
what could i do
every word i said to make things better was taken as treason same as it was last night
i can't get away for all i have in the world is in my store
if i leave the society i know well that it means murder to me and god knows what to my wife and children
oh man it is awful awful
he put his hands to his face and his body shook with convulsive sobs
mcmurdo shrugged his shoulders
you were too soft for the job said he
you are the wrong sort for such work
i had a conscience and a religion but they made me a criminal among them
i was chosen for a job
if i backed down i knew well what would come to me
maybe i'm a coward
maybe it's the thought of my poor little woman and the children that makes me one
anyhow i went
i guess it will haunt me forever
it was a lonely house twenty miles from here over the range yonder
i was told off for the door same as you were last night
they could not trust me with the job
the others went in
when they came out their hands were crimson to the wrists
as we turned away a child was screaming out of the house behind us
it was a boy of five who had seen his father murdered
i nearly fainted with the horror of it and yet i had to keep a bold and smiling face for well i knew that if i did not it would be out of my house that they would come next with their bloody hands and it would be my little fred that would be screaming for his father
but i was a criminal then part sharer in a murder lost forever in this world and lost also in the next
i am a good catholic but the priest would have no word with me when he heard i was a scowrer and i am excommunicated from my faith
that's how it stands with me
and i see you going down the same road and i ask you what the end is to be
are you ready to be a cold blooded murderer also or can we do anything to stop it
what would you do
asked mcmurdo abruptly
you would not inform
god forbid
cried morris
sure the very thought would cost me my life
that's well said mcmurdo
i'm thinking that you are a weak man and that you make too much of the matter
too much
wait till you have lived here longer
look down the valley
see the cloud of a hundred chimneys that overshadows it
i tell you that the cloud of murder hangs thicker and lower than that over the heads of the people
it is the valley of fear the valley of death
the terror is in the hearts of the people from the dusk to the dawn
wait young man and you will learn for yourself
well i'll let you know what i think when i have seen more said mcmurdo carelessly
what is very clear is that you are not the man for the place and that the sooner you sell out if you only get a dime a dollar for what the business is worth the better it will be for you
what you have said is safe with me but by gar
if i thought you were an informer no no
cried morris piteously
well let it rest at that
i'll bear what you have said in mind and maybe some day i'll come back to it
i expect you meant kindly by speaking to me like this
now i'll be getting home
one word before you go said morris
we may have been seen together
they may want to know what we have spoken about
ah
that's well thought of
i offer you a clerkship in my store
and i refuse it
that's our business
well so long brother morris and may you find things go better with you in the future
that same afternoon as mcmurdo sat smoking lost in thought beside the stove of his sitting room the door swung open and its framework was filled with the huge figure of boss mcginty
he passed the sign and then seating himself opposite to the young man he looked at him steadily for some time a look which was as steadily returned
i'm not much of a visitor brother mcmurdo he said at last
i guess i am too busy over the folk that visit me
but i thought i'd stretch a point and drop down to see you in your own house
i'm proud to see you here councillor mcmurdo answered heartily bringing his whisky bottle out of the cupboard
it's an honour that i had not expected
how's the arm
asked the boss
mcmurdo made a wry face
well i'm not forgetting it he said but it's worth it
yes it's worth it the other answered to those that are loyal and go through with it and are a help to the lodge
what were you speaking to brother morris about on miller hill this morning
the question came so suddenly that it was well that he had his answer prepared
he burst into a hearty laugh
morris didn't know i could earn a living here at home
he shan't know either for he has got too much conscience for the likes of me
but he's a good hearted old chap
it was his idea that i was at a loose end and that he would do me a good turn by offering me a clerkship in a dry goods store
oh that was it
yes that was it
and you refused it
sure
couldn't i earn ten times as much in my own bedroom with four hours' work
that's so
but i wouldn't get about too much with morris
why not
well i guess because i tell you not
that's enough for most folk in these parts
it may be enough for most folk but it ain't enough for me councillor said mcmurdo boldly
if you are a judge of men you'll know that
the swarthy giant glared at him and his hairy paw closed for an instant round the glass as though he would hurl it at the head of his companion
then he laughed in his loud boisterous insincere fashion
you're a queer card for sure said he
well if you want reasons i'll give them
did morris say nothing to you against the lodge
no
nor against me
no
well that's because he daren't trust you
but in his heart he is not a loyal brother
we know that well
so we watch him and we wait for the time to admonish him
i'm thinking that the time is drawing near
there's no room for scabby sheep in our pen
but if you keep company with a disloyal man we might think that you were disloyal too
see
there's no chance of my keeping company with him for i dislike the man mcmurdo answered
as to being disloyal if it was any man but you he would not use the word to me twice
well that's enough said mcginty draining off his glass
i came down to give you a word in season and you've had it
i'd like to know said mcmurdo how you ever came to learn that i had spoken with morris at all
mcginty laughed
it's my business to know what goes on in this township said he
i guess you'd best reckon on my hearing all that passes
well time's up and i'll just say but his leavetaking was cut short in a very unexpected fashion
with a sudden crash the door flew open and three frowning intent faces glared in at them from under the peaks of police caps
mcmurdo sprang to his feet and half drew his revolver but his arm stopped midway as he became conscious that two winchester rifles were levelled at his head
a man in uniform advanced into the room a six shooter in his hand
it was captain marvin once of chicago and now of the mine constabulary
he shook his head with a half smile at mcmurdo
i thought you'd be getting into trouble mr
crooked mcmurdo of chicago said he
can't keep out of it can you
take your hat and come along with us
i guess you'll pay for this captain marvin said mcginty
who are you i'd like to know to break into a house in this fashion and molest honest law abiding men
you're standing out in this deal councillor mcginty said the police captain
we are not out after you but after this man mcmurdo
it is for you to help not to hinder us in our duty
he is a friend of mine and i'll answer for his conduct said the boss
by all accounts mr
mcginty you may have to answer for your own conduct some of these days the captain answered
this man mcmurdo was a crook before ever he came here and he's a crook still
cover him patrolman while i disarm him
there's my pistol said mcmurdo coolly
maybe captain marvin if you and i were alone and face to face you would not take me so easily
where's your warrant
asked mcginty
by gar
a man might as well live in russia as in vermissa while folk like you are running the police
it's a capitalist outrage and you'll hear more of it i reckon
you do what you think is your duty the best way you can councillor
we'll look after ours
what am i accused of
asked mcmurdo
of being concerned in the beating of old editor stanger at the herald office
it wasn't your fault that it isn't a murder charge
well if that's all you have against him cried mcginty with a laugh you can save yourself a deal of trouble by dropping it right now
this man was with me in my saloon playing poker up to midnight and i can bring a dozen to prove it
that's your affair and i guess you can settle it in court to morrow
meanwhile come on mcmurdo and come quietly if you don't want a gun across your head
you stand wide mr
mcginty for i warn you i will stand no resistance when i am on duty
so determined was the appearance of the captain that both mcmurdo and his boss were forced to accept the situation
the latter managed to have a few whispered words with the prisoner before they parted
what about he jerked his thumb upward to signify the coining plant
all right whispered mcmurdo who had devised a safe hiding place under the floor
i'll bid you good bye said the boss shaking hands
i'll see reilly the lawyer and take the defense upon myself
take my word for it that they won't be able to hold you
i wouldn't bet on that
guard the prisoner you two and shoot him if he tries any games
i'll search the house before i leave
he did so but apparently found no trace of the concealed plant
when he had descended he and his men escorted mcmurdo to headquarters
darkness had fallen and a keen blizzard was blowing so that the streets were nearly deserted but a few loiterers followed the group and emboldened by invisibility shouted imprecations at the prisoner
lynch the cursed scowrer
they cried
lynch him
they laughed and jeered as he was pushed into the police station
after a short formal examination from the inspector in charge he was put into the common cell
here he found baldwin and three other criminals of the night before all arrested that afternoon and waiting their trial next morning
but even within this inner fortress of the law the long arm of the freemen was able to extend
late at night there came a jailer with a straw bundle for their bedding out of which he extracted two bottles of whisky some glasses and a pack of cards
they spent a hilarious night without an anxious thought as to the ordeal of the morning
nor had they cause as the result was to show
the magistrate could not possibly on the evidence have held them for a higher court
on the one hand the compositors and pressmen were forced to admit that the light was uncertain that they were themselves much perturbed and that it was difficult for them to swear to the identity of the assailants although they believed that the accused were among them
cross examined by the clever attorney who had been engaged by mcginty they were even more nebulous in their evidence
the injured man had already deposed that he was so taken by surprise by the suddenness of the attack that he could state nothing beyond the fact that the first man who struck him wore a moustache
he added that he knew them to be scowrers since no one else in the community could possibly have any enmity to him and he had long been threatened on account of his outspoken editorials
on the other hand it was clearly shown by the united and unfaltering evidence of six citizens including that high municipal official councillor mcginty that the men had been at a card party at the union house until an hour very much later than the commission of the outrage
needless to say that they were discharged with something very near to an apology from the bench for the inconvenience to which they had been put together with an implied censure of captain marvin and the police for their officious zeal
the verdict was greeted with loud applause by a court in which mcmurdo saw many familiar faces
brothers of the lodge smiled and waved
but there were others who sat with compressed lips and brooding eyes as the men filed out of the dock
one of them a little dark bearded resolute fellow put the thoughts of himself and comrades into words as the ex prisoners passed him
you damned murderers
he said
we'll fix you yet
if anything had been needed to give an impetus to jack mcmurdo's popularity among his fellows it would have been his arrest and acquittal
that a man on the very night of joining the lodge should have done something which brought him before the magistrate was a new record in the annals of the society
already he had earned the reputation of a good boon companion a cheery reveller and withal a man of high temper who would not take an insult even from the all powerful boss himself
but in addition to this he impressed his comrades with the idea that among them all there was not one whose brain was so ready to devise a bloodthirsty scheme or whose hand would be more capable of carrying it out
he'll be the boy for the clean job said the oldsters to one another and waited their time until they could set him to his work
mcginty had instruments enough already but he recognized that this was a supremely able one
he felt like a man holding a fierce bloodhound in leash
there were curs to do the smaller work but some day he would slip this creature upon its prey
a few members of the lodge ted baldwin among them resented the rapid rise of the stranger and hated him for it but they kept clear of him for he was as ready to fight as to laugh
but if he gained favour with his fellows there was another quarter one which had become even more vital to him in which he lost it
ettie shafter's father would have nothing more to do with him nor would he allow him to enter the house
ettie herself was too deeply in love to give him up altogether and yet her own good sense warned her of what would come from a marriage with a man who was regarded as a criminal
one morning after a sleepless night she determined to see him possibly for the last time and make one strong endeavour to draw him from those evil influences which were sucking him down
she went to his house as he had often begged her to do and made her way into the room which he used as his sitting room
he was seated at a table with his back turned and a letter in front of him
a sudden spirit of girlish mischief came over her she was still only nineteen
he had not heard her when she pushed open the door
now she tiptoed forward and laid her hand lightly upon his bended shoulders
if she had expected to startle him she certainly succeeded but only in turn to be startled herself
with a tiger spring he turned on her and his right hand was feeling for her throat
at the same instant with the other hand he crumpled up the paper that lay before him
for an instant he stood glaring
then astonishment and joy took the place of the ferocity which had convulsed his features a ferocity which had sent her shrinking back in horror as from something which had never before intruded into her gentle life
it's you
said he mopping his brow
and to think that you should come to me heart of my heart and i should find nothing better to do than to want to strangle you
come then darling and he held out his arms let me make it up to you
but she had not recovered from that sudden glimpse of guilty fear which she had read in the man's face
all her woman's instinct told her that it was not the mere fright of a man who is startled
guilt that was it guilt and fear
what's come over you jack
she cried
why were you so scared of me
oh jack if your conscience was at ease you would not have looked at me like that
sure i was thinking of other things and when you came tripping so lightly on those fairy feet of yours no no it was more than that jack
then a sudden suspicion seized her
let me see that letter you were writing
ah ettie i couldn't do that
her suspicions became certainties
it's to another woman she cried
i know it
why else should you hold it from me
was it to your wife that you were writing
how am i to know that you are not a married man you a stranger that nobody knows
i am not married ettie
see now i swear it
you're the only one woman on earth to me
by the cross of christ i swear it
he was so white with passionate earnestness that she could not but believe him
well then she cried why will you not show me the letter
i'll tell you acushla said he
i'm under oath not to show it and just as i wouldn't break my word to you so i would keep it to those who hold my promise
it's the business of the lodge and even to you it's secret
and if i was scared when a hand fell on me can't you understand it when it might have been the hand of a detective
she felt that he was telling the truth
he gathered her into his arms and kissed away her fears and doubts
sit here by me then
it's a queer throne for such a queen but it's the best your poor lover can find
he'll do better for you some of these days i'm thinking
now your mind is easy once again is it not
how can it ever be at ease jack when i know that you are a criminal among criminals when i never know the day that i may hear you are in court for murder
'mcmurdo the scowrer ' that's what one of our boarders called you yesterday
it went through my heart like a knife
sure hard words break no bones
but they were true
well dear it's not so bad as you think
we are but poor men that are trying in our own way to get our rights
ettie threw her arms round her lover's neck
give it up jack
for my sake for god's sake give it up
it was to ask you that i came here to day
oh jack see i beg it of you on my bended knees
kneeling here before you i implore you to give it up
he raised her and soothed her with her head against his breast
sure my darlin' you don't know what it is you are asking
how could i give it up when it would be to break my oath and to desert my comrades
if you could see how things stand with me you could never ask it of me
besides if i wanted to how could i do it
you don't suppose that the lodge would let a man go free with all its secrets
i've thought of that jack
i've planned it all
father has saved some money
he is weary of this place where the fear of these people darkens our lives
he is ready to go
we would fly together to philadelphia or new york where we would be safe from them
mcmurdo laughed
the lodge has a long arm
do you think it could not stretch from here to philadelphia or new york
well then to the west or to england or to germany where father came from anywhere to get away from this valley of fear
mcmurdo thought of old brother morris
sure it is the second time i have heard the valley so named said he
the shadow does indeed seem to lie heavy on some of you
it darkens every moment of our lives
do you suppose that ted baldwin has ever forgiven us
if it were not that he fears you what do you suppose our chances would be
if you saw the look in those dark hungry eyes of his when they fall on me
by gar
i'd teach him better manners if i caught him at it
but see here little girl
i can't leave here
i can't take that from me once and for all
but if you will leave me to find my own way i will try to prepare a way of getting honourably out of it
there is no honour in such a matter
well well it's just how you look at it
but if you'll give me six months i'll work it so that i can leave without being ashamed to look others in the face
the girl laughed with joy
six months
she cried
is it a promise
well it may be seven or eight
but within a year at the furthest we will leave the valley behind us
it was the most that ettie could obtain and yet it was something
there was this distant light to illuminate the gloom of the immediate future
she returned to her father's house more light hearted than she had ever been since jack mcmurdo had come into her life
it might be thought that as a member all the doings of the society would be told to him but he was soon to discover that the organization was wider and more complex than the simple lodge
even boss mcginty was ignorant as to many things for there was an official named the county delegate living at hobson's patch farther down the line who had power over several different lodges which he wielded in a sudden and arbitrary way
only once did mcmurdo see him a sly little gray haired rat of a man with a slinking gait and a sidelong glance which was charged with malice
evans pott was his name and even the great boss of vermissa felt towards him something of the repulsion and fear which the huge danton may have felt for the puny but dangerous robespierre
one day scanlan who was mcmurdo's fellow boarder received a note from mcginty inclosing one from evans pott which informed him that he was sending over two good men lawler and andrews who had instructions to act in the neighbourhood though it was best for the cause that no particulars as to their objects should be given
would the bodymaster see to it that suitable arrangements be made for their lodgings and comfort until the time for action should arrive
mcginty added that it was impossible for anyone to remain secret at the union house and that therefore he would be obliged if mcmurdo and scanlan would put the strangers up for a few days in their boarding house
the same evening the two men arrived each carrying his gripsack
lawler was an elderly man shrewd silent and self contained clad in an old black frock coat which with his soft felt hat and ragged grizzled beard gave him a general resemblance to an itinerant preacher
his companion andrews was little more than a boy frank faced and cheerful with the breezy manner of one who is out for a holiday and means to enjoy every minute of it
both men were total abstainers and behaved in all ways as exemplary members of the society with the one simple exception that they were assassins who had often proved themselves to be most capable instruments for this association of murder
lawler had already carried out fourteen commissions of the kind and andrews three
they were as mcmurdo found quite ready to converse about their deeds in the past which they recounted with the half bashful pride of men who had done good and unselfish service for the community
they were reticent however as to the immediate job in hand
they chose us because neither i nor the boy here drink lawler explained
they can count on us saying no more than we should
you must not take it amiss but it is the orders of the county delegate that we obey
sure we are all in it together said scanlan mcmurdo's mate as the four sat together at supper
that's true enough and we'll talk till the cows come home of the killing of charlie williams or of simon bird or any other job in the past
but till the work is done we say nothing
there are half a dozen about here that i have a word to say to said mcmurdo with an oath
i suppose it isn't jack knox of ironhill that you are after
i'd go some way to see him get his deserts
no it's not him yet
or herman strauss
no nor him either
well if you won't tell us we can't make you but i'd be glad to know
lawler smiled and shook his head
he was not to be drawn
in spite of the reticence of their guests scanlan and mcmurdo were quite determined to be present at what they called the fun
when therefore at an early hour one morning mcmurdo heard them creeping down the stairs he awakened scanlan and the two hurried on their clothes
when they were dressed they found that the others had stolen out leaving the door open behind them
it was not yet dawn and by the light of the lamps they could see the two men some distance down the street
they followed them warily treading noiselessly in the deep snow
the boarding house was near the edge of the town and soon they were at the crossroads which is beyond its boundary
here three men were waiting with whom lawler and andrews held a short eager conversation
then they all moved on together
it was clearly some notable job which needed numbers
at this point there are several trails which lead to various mines
the strangers took that which led to the crow hill a huge business which was in strong hands which had been able thanks to their energetic and fearless new england manager josiah h dunn to keep some order and discipline during the long reign of terror
day was breaking now and a line of workmen were slowly making their way singly and in groups along the blackened path
mcmurdo and scanlan strolled on with the others keeping in sight of the men whom they followed
a thick mist lay over them and from the heart of it there came the sudden scream of a steam whistle
it was the ten minute signal before the cages descended and the day's labour began
when they reached the open space round the mine shaft there were a hundred miners waiting stamping their feet and blowing on their fingers for it was bitterly cold
the strangers stood in a little group under the shadow of the engine house
scanlan and mcmurdo climbed a heap of slag from which the whole scene lay before them
they saw the mine engineer a great bearded scotchman named menzies come out of the engine house and blow his whistle for the cages to be lowered
at the same instant a tall loose framed young man with a clean shaved earnest face advanced eagerly towards the pit head
as he came forward his eyes fell upon the group silent and motionless under the engine house
the men had drawn down their hats and turned up their collars to screen their faces
for a moment the presentiment of death laid its cold hand upon the manager's heart
at the next he had shaken it off and saw only his duty towards intrusive strangers
who are you
he asked as he advanced
what are you loitering there for
there was no answer but the lad andrews stepped forward and shot him in the stomach
the hundred waiting miners stood as motionless and helpless as if they were paralyzed
the manager clapped his two hands to the wound and doubled himself up
then he staggered away but another of the assassins fired and he went down sidewise kicking and clawing among a heap of clinkers
menzies the scotchman gave a roar of rage at the sight and rushed with an iron spanner at the murderers but was met by two balls in the face which dropped him dead at their very feet
there was a surge forward of some of the miners and an inarticulate cry of pity and of anger but a couple of the strangers emptied their six shooters over the heads of the crowd and they broke and scattered some of them rushing wildly back to their homes in vermissa
when a few of the bravest had rallied and there was a return to the mine the murderous gang had vanished in the mists of morning without a single witness being able to swear to the identity of these men who in front of a hundred spectators had wrought this double crime
scanlan and mcmurdo made their way back scanlan somewhat subdued for it was the first murder job that he had seen with his own eyes and it appeared less funny than he had been led to believe
the horrible screams of the dead manager's wife pursued them as they hurried to the town
mcmurdo was absorbed and silent but he showed no sympathy for the weakening of his companion
sure it is like a war he repeated
what is it but a war between us and them and we hit back where we best can
there was high revel in the lodge room at the union house that night not only over the killing of the manager and engineer of the crow hill mine which would bring this organization into line with the other blackmailed and terror stricken companies of the district but also over a distant triumph which had been wrought by the hands of the lodge itself
it would appear that when the county delegate had sent over five good men to strike a blow in vermissa he had demanded that in return three vermissa men should be secretly selected and sent across to kill william hales of stake royal one of the best known and most popular mine owners in the gilmerton district a man who was believed not to have an enemy in the world for he was in all ways a model employer
he had insisted however upon efficiency in the work and had therefore paid off certain drunken and idle employees who were members of the all powerful society
coffin notices hung outside his door had not weakened his resolution and so in a free civilized country he found himself condemned to death
the execution had now been duly carried out
ted baldwin who sprawled now in the seat of honour beside the bodymaster had been chief of the party
his flushed face and glazed blood shot eyes told of sleeplessness and drink
he and his two comrades had spent the night before among the mountains
they were unkempt and weather stained
but no heroes returning from a forlorn hope could have had a warmer welcome from their comrades
the story was told and retold amid cries of delight and shouts of laughter
they had waited for their man as he drove home at nightfall taking their station at the top of a steep hill where his horse must be at a walk
he was so furred to keep out the cold that he could not lay his hand on his pistol
they had pulled him out and shot him again and again
he had screamed for mercy
the screams were repeated for the amusement of the lodge
let's hear again how he squealed they cried
none of them knew the man but there is eternal drama in a killing and they had shown the scowrers of gilmerton that the vermissa men were to be relied upon
there had been one contretemps for a man and his wife had driven up while they were still emptying their revolvers into the silent body
it had been suggested that they should shoot them both but they were harmless folk who were not connected with the mines so they were sternly bidden to drive on and keep silent lest a worse thing befall them
and so the blood mottled figure had been left as a warning to all such hard hearted employers and the three noble avengers had hurried off into the mountains where unbroken nature comes down to the very edge of the furnaces and the slag heaps
here they were safe and sound their work well done and the plaudits of their companions in their ears
it had been a great day for the scowrers
the shadow had fallen even darker over the valley
but as the wise general chooses the moment of victory in which to redouble his efforts so that his foes may have no time to steady themselves after disaster so boss mcginty looking out upon the scene of his operations with his brooding and malicious eyes had devised a new attack upon those who opposed him
that very night as the half drunken company broke up he touched mcmurdo on the arm and led him aside into that inner room where they had their first interview
see here my lad said he i've got a job that's worthy of you at last
you'll have the doing of it in your own hands
proud i am to hear it mcmurdo answered
you can take two men with you manders and reilly
they have been warned for service
we'll never be right in this district until chester wilcox has been settled and you'll have the thanks of every lodge in the coal fields if you can down him
i'll do my best anyhow
who is he and where shall i find him
mcginty took his eternal half chewed half smoked cigar from the corner of his mouth and proceeded to draw a rough diagram on a page torn from his notebook
he's the chief foreman of the iron dike company
he's a hard citizen an old colour sergeant of the war all scars and grizzle
we've had two tries at him but had no luck and jim carnaway lost his life over it
now it's for you to take it over
that's the house all alone at the iron dike crossroad same as you see here on the map without another within earshot
it's no good by day
he's armed and shoots quick and straight with no questions asked
but at night well there he is with his wife three children and a hired help
you can't pick or choose
it's all or none
if you could get a bag of blasting powder at the front door with a slow match to it what's the man done
didn't i tell you he shot jim carnaway
why did he shoot him
what in thunder has that to do with you
carnaway was about his house at night and he shot him
that's enough for me and you
you've got to settle the thing right
there's these two women and the children
do they go up too
they have to else how can we get him
it seems hard on them for they've done nothing
what sort of fool's talk is this
do you back out
easy councillor easy
what have i ever said or done that you should think i would be after standing back from an order of the bodymaster of my own lodge
if it's right or if it's wrong it's for you to decide
you'll do it then
of course i will do it
when
well you had best give me a night or two that i may see the house and make my plans
then very good said mcginty shaking him by the hand
i leave it with you
it will be a great day when you bring us the news
it's just the last stroke that will bring them all to their knees
mcmurdo thought long and deeply over the commission which had been so suddenly placed in his hands
the isolated house in which chester wilcox lived was about five miles off in an adjacent valley
that very night he started off all alone to prepare for the attempt
it was daylight before he returned from his reconnaissance
next day he interviewed his two subordinates manders and reilly reckless youngsters who were as elated as if it were a deer hunt
two nights later they met outside the town all three armed and one of them carrying a sack stuffed with the powder which was used in the quarries
it was two in the morning before they came to the lonely house
the night was a windy one with broken clouds drifting swiftly across the face of a three quarter moon
they had been warned to be on their guard against bloodhounds so they moved forward cautiously with their pistols cocked in their hands
but there was no sound save the howling of the wind and no movement but the swaying branches above them
mcmurdo listened at the door of the lonely house but all was still within
then he leaned the powder bag against it ripped a hole in it with his knife and attached the fuse
when it was well alight he and his two companions took to their heels and were some distance off safe and snug in a sheltering ditch before the shattering roar of the explosion with the low deep rumble of the collapsing building told them that their work was done
no cleaner job had ever been carried out in the bloodstained annals of the society
but alas that work so well organized and boldly carried out should all have gone for nothing
warned by the fate of the various victims and knowing that he was marked down for destruction chester wilcox had moved himself and his family only the day before to some safer and less known quarters where a guard of police should watch over them
it was an empty house which had been torn down by the gunpowder and the grim old colour sergeant of the war was still teaching discipline to the miners of iron dike
leave him to me said mcmurdo
he's my man and i'll get him sure if i have to wait a year for him
a vote of thanks and confidence was passed in full lodge and so for the time the matter ended
when a few weeks later it was reported in the papers that wilcox had been shot at from an ambuscade it was an open secret that mcmurdo was still at work upon his unfinished job
such were the methods of the society of freemen and such were the deeds of the scowrers by which they spread their rule of fear over the great and rich district which was for so long a period haunted by their terrible presence
why should these pages be stained by further crimes
have i not said enough to show the men and their methods
these deeds are written in history and there are records wherein one may read the details of them
there one may learn of the shooting of policemen hunt and evans because they had ventured to arrest two members of the society a double outrage planned at the vermissa lodge and carried out in cold blood upon two helpless and disarmed men
there also one may read of the shooting of mrs
larbey when she was nursing her husband who had been beaten almost to death by orders of boss mcginty
the killing of the elder jenkins shortly followed by that of his brother the mutilation of james murdoch the blowing up of the staphouse family and the murder of the stendals all followed hard upon one another in the same terrible winter
darkly the shadow lay upon the valley of fear
the spring had come with running brooks and blossoming trees
there was hope for all nature bound so long in an iron grip but nowhere was there any hope for the men and women who lived under the yoke of the terror
never had the cloud above them been so dark and hopeless as in the early summer of the year
it was the height of the reign of terror
mcmurdo who had already been appointed inner deacon with every prospect of some day succeeding mcginty as bodymaster was now so necessary to the councils of his comrades that nothing was done without his help and advice
the more popular he became however with the freemen the blacker were the scowls which greeted him as he passed along the streets of vermissa
in spite of their terror the citizens were taking heart to band themselves together against their oppressors
rumours had reached the lodge of secret gatherings in the herald office and of distribution of firearms among the law abiding people
but mcginty and his men were undisturbed by such reports
they were numerous resolute and well armed
their opponents were scattered and powerless
it would all end as it had done in the past in aimless talk and possibly in impotent arrests
so said mcginty mcmurdo and all the bolder spirits
it was a saturday evening in may
saturday was always the lodge night and mcmurdo was leaving his house to attend it when morris the weaker brother of the order came to see him
his brow was creased with care and his kindly face was drawn and haggard
can i speak with you freely mr
mcmurdo
sure
i can't forget that i spoke my heart to you once and that you kept it to yourself even though the boss himself came to ask you about it
what else could i do if you trusted me
it wasn't that i agreed with what you said
i know that well
but you are the one that i can speak to and be safe
i've a secret here he put his hand to his breast and it is just burning the life out of me
i wish it had come to any one of you but me
if i tell it it will mean murder for sure
if i don't it may bring the end of us all
god help me but i am near out of my wits over it
mcmurdo looked at the man earnestly
he was trembling in every limb
he poured some whisky into a glass and handed it to him
that's the physic for the likes of you said he
now let me hear of it
morris drank and his white face took a tinge of colour
i can tell it to you all in one sentence said he
there's a detective on our trail
mcmurdo stared at him in astonishment
why man you're crazy he said
isn't the place full of police and detectives and what harm did they ever do us
no no it's no man of the district
as you say we know them and it is little that they can do
but you've heard of pinkerton's
i've read of some folk of that name
well you can take it from me you've no show when they are on your trail
it's not a take it or miss it government concern
it's a dead earnest business proposition that's out for results and keeps out till by hook or crook it gets them
if a pinkerton man is deep in this business we are all destroyed
we must kill him
ah it's the first thought that came to you
so it will be up at the lodge
didn't i say to you that it would end in murder
sure what is murder
isn't it common enough in these parts
it is indeed but it's not for me to point out the man that is to be murdered
i'd never rest easy again
and yet it's our own necks that may be at stake
in god's name what shall i do
he rocked to and fro in his agony of indecision
but his words had moved mcmurdo deeply
it was easy to see that he shared the other's opinion as to the danger and the need for meeting it
he gripped morris's shoulder and shook him in his earnestness
see here man he cried and he almost screeched the words in his excitement you won't gain anything by sitting keening like an old wife at a wake
let's have the facts
who is the fellow
where is he
how did you hear of him
why did you come to me
i came to you for you are the one man that would advise me
i told you that i had a store in the east before i came here
i left good friends behind me and one of them is in the telegraph service
here's a letter that i had from him yesterday
it's this part from the top of the page
you can read it yourself
this was what mcmurdo read how are the scowrers getting on in your parts
we read plenty of them in the papers
between you and me i expect to hear news from you before long
five big corporations and the two railroads have taken the thing up in dead earnest
they mean it and you can bet they'll get there
they are right deep down into it
pinkerton has taken hold under their orders and his best man birdy edwards is operating
the thing has got to be stopped right now
now read the postscript
of course what i give you is what i learned in business so it goes no further
it's a queer cipher that you handle by the yard every day and can get no meaning from
mcmurdo sat in silence for some time with the letter in his listless hands
the mist had lifted for a moment and there was the abyss before him
does anyone else know of this
he asked
i have told no one else
but this man your friend has he any other person that he would be likely to write to
well i dare say he knows one or two more
of the lodge
it's likely enough
i was asking because it is likely that he may have given some description of this fellow birdy edwards then we could get on his trail
well it's possible
but i should not think he knew him
he is just telling me the news that came to him by way of business
how would he know this pinkerton man
mcmurdo gave a violent start
by gar
he cried i've got him
what a fool i was not to know it
lord
but we're in luck
we will fix him before he can do any harm
see here morris will you leave this thing in my hands
sure if you will only take it off mine
i'll do that
you can stand right back and let me run it
even your name need not be mentioned
i'll take it all on myself as if it were to me that this letter has come
will that content you
it's just what i would ask
then leave it at that and keep your head shut
now i'll get down to the lodge and we'll soon make old man pinkerton sorry for himself
you wouldn't kill this man
the less you know friend morris the easier your conscience will be and the better you will sleep
ask no questions and let these things settle themselves
i have hold of it now
morris shook his head sadly as he left
i feel that his blood is on my hands he groaned
self protection is no murder anyhow said mcmurdo smiling grimly
it's him or us
i guess this man would destroy us all if we left him long in the valley
why brother morris we'll have to elect you bodymaster yet for you've surely saved the lodge
and yet it was clear from his actions that he thought more seriously of this new intrusion than his words would show
it may have been his guilty conscience it may have been the reputation of the pinkerton organization it may have been the knowledge that great rich corporations had set themselves the task of clearing out the scowrers but whatever his reason his actions were those of a man who is preparing for the worst
every paper which would incriminate him was destroyed before he left the house
after that he gave a long sigh of satisfaction for it seemed to him that he was safe
and yet the danger must still have pressed somewhat upon him for on his way to the lodge he stopped at old man shafter's
the house was forbidden him but when he tapped at the window ettie came out to him
the dancing irish deviltry had gone from her lover's eyes
she read his danger in his earnest face
something has happened
she cried
oh jack you are in danger
sure it is not very bad my sweetheart
and yet it may be wise that we make a move before it is worse
make a move
i promised you once that i would go some day
i think the time is coming
i had news to night bad news and i see trouble coming
the police
well a pinkerton
but sure you wouldn't know what that is acushla nor what it may mean to the likes of me
i'm too deep in this thing and i may have to get out of it quick
you said you would come with me if i went
oh jack it would be the saving of you
i'm an honest man in some things ettie
i wouldn't hurt a hair of your bonny head for all that the world can give nor ever pull you down one inch from the golden throne above the clouds where i always see you
would you trust me
she put her hand in his without a word
well then listen to what i say and do as i order you for indeed it's the only way for us
things are going to happen in this valley
i feel it in my bones
there may be many of us that will have to look out for ourselves
i'm one anyhow
if i go by day or night it's you that must come with me
i'd come after you jack
no no you shall come with me
if this valley is closed to me and i can never come back how can i leave you behind and me perhaps in hiding from the police with never a chance of a message
it's with me you must come
i know a good woman in the place i come from and it's there i'd leave you till we can get married
will you come
yes jack i will come
god bless you for your trust in me
it's a fiend out of hell that i should be if i abused it
now mark you ettie it will be just a word to you and when it reaches you you will drop everything and come right down to the waiting room at the depot and stay there till i come for you
day or night i'll come at the word jack
somewhat eased in mind now that his own preparations for escape had been begun mcmurdo went on to the lodge
it had already assembled and only by complicated signs and counter signs could he pass through the outer guard and inner guard who close tiled it
a buzz of pleasure and welcome greeted him as he entered
the long room was crowded and through the haze of tobacco smoke he saw the tangled black mane of the bodymaster the cruel unfriendly features of baldwin the vulture face of harraway the secretary and a dozen more who were among the leaders of the lodge
he rejoiced that they should all be there to take counsel over his news
indeed it's glad we are to see you brother
cried the chairman
there's business here that wants a solomon in judgment to set it right
it's lander and egan explained his neighbour as he took his seat
they both claim the head money given by the lodge for the shooting of old man crabbe over at stylestown and who's to say which fired the bullet
mcmurdo rose in his place and raised his hand
the expression of his face froze the attention of the audience
there was a dead hush of expectation
eminent bodymaster he said in a solemn voice i claim urgency
brother mcmurdo claims urgency said mcginty
it's a claim that by the rules of this lodge takes precedence
now brother we attend you
mcmurdo took the letter from his pocket
eminent bodymaster and brethren he said i am the bearer of ill news this day but it is better that it should be known and discussed than that a blow should fall upon us without warning which would destroy us all
i have information that the most powerful and richest organizations in this state have bound themselves together for our destruction and that at this very moment there is a pinkerton detective one birdy edwards at work in the valley collecting the evidence which may put a rope round the necks of many of us and send every man in this room into a felon's cell
that is the situation for the discussion of which i have made a claim of urgency
there was a dead silence in the room
it was broken by the chairman
what is your evidence for this brother mcmurdo
he asked
it is in this letter which has come into my hands said mcmurdo
he read the passage aloud
it is a matter of honour with me that i can give no further particulars about the letter nor put it into your hands but i assure you that there is nothing else in it which can affect the interests of the lodge
i put the case before you as it has reached me
let me say mr
chairman said one of the older brethren that i have heard of birdy edwards and that he has the name of being the best man in the pinkerton service
does anyone know him by sight
asked mcginty
yes said mcmurdo i do
there was a murmur of astonishment through the hall
i believe we hold him in the hollow of our hands he continued with an exulting smile upon his face
if we act quickly and wisely we can cut this thing short
if i have your confidence and your help it is little that we have to fear
what have we to fear anyhow
what can he know of our affairs
you might say so if all were as stanch as you councillor
but this man has all the millions of the capitalists at his back
do you think there is no weaker brother among all our lodges that could not be bought
he will get at our secrets maybe has got them already
there's only one sure cure
that he never leaves the valley said baldwin
mcmurdo nodded
good for you brother baldwin he said
you and i have had our differences but you have said the true word to night
where is he then
where shall we know him
eminent bodymaster said mcmurdo earnestly i would put it to you that this is too vital a thing for us to discuss in open lodge
god forbid that i should throw a doubt on anyone here but if so much as a word of gossip got to the ears of this man there would be an end of any chance of our getting him
i would ask the lodge to choose a trusty committee mr
chairman yourself if i might suggest it and brother baldwin here and five more
then i can talk freely of what i know and of what i advise should be done
the proposition was at once adopted and the committee chosen
besides the chairman and baldwin there were the vulture faced secretary harraway tiger cormac the brutal young assassin carter the treasurer and the brothers willaby fearless and desperate men who would stick at nothing
the usual revelry of the lodge was short and subdued for there was a cloud upon the men's spirits and many there for the first time began to see the cloud of avenging law drifting up in that serene sky under which they had dwelt so long
the horrors they had dealt out to others had been so much a part of their settled lives that the thought of retribution had become a remote one and so seemed the more startling now that it came so closely upon them
they broke up early and left their leaders to their council
now mcmurdo
said mcginty when they were alone
the seven men sat frozen in their seats
i said just now that i knew birdy edwards mcmurdo explained
i need not tell you that he is not here under that name
he's a brave man but not a crazy one
he passes under the name of steve wilson and he is lodging at hobson's patch
how do you know this
because i fell into talk with him
i thought little of it at the time nor would have given it a second thought but for this letter but now i'm sure it's the man
i met him on the cars when i went down the line on wednesday a hard case if ever there was one
he said he was a reporter
i believed it for the moment
wanted to know all he could about the scowrers and what he called 'the outrages' for a new york paper
asked me every kind of question so as to get something
you bet i was giving nothing away
'i'd pay for it and pay well ' said he 'if i could get some stuff that would suit my editor '
i said what i thought would please him best and he handed me a twenty dollar bill for my information
'there's ten times that for you ' said he 'if you can find me all that i want '
what did you tell him then
any stuff i could make up
how do you know he wasn't a newspaper man
i'll tell you
he got out at hobson's patch and so did i i chanced into the telegraph bureau and he was leaving it
'see here ' said the operator after he'd gone out 'i guess we should charge double rates for this '
'i guess you should ' said i he had filled the form with stuff that might have been chinese for all we could make of it
'he fires a sheet of this off every day ' said the clerk
'yes ' said i 'it's special news for his paper and he's scared that the others should tap it '
that was what the operator thought and what i thought at the time but i think differently now
by gar
i believe you are right said mcginty
but what do you allow that we should do about it
why not go right down now and fix him
someone suggested
ay the sooner the better
i'd start this next minute if i knew where we could find him said mcmurdo
he's in hobson's patch but i don't know the house
i've got a plan though if you'll only take my advice
well what is it
i'll go to the patch to morrow morning
i'll find him through the operator
he can locate him i guess
well then i'll tell him that i'm a freeman myself
i'll offer him all the secrets of the lodge for a price
you bet he'll tumble to it
i'll tell him the papers are at my house and that it's as much as my life would be worth to let him come while folk were about
he'll see that that's horse sense
let him come at ten o'clock at night and he shall see everything
that will fetch him sure
well
you can plan the rest for yourselves
widow macnamara's is a lonely house
she's as true as steel and as deaf as a post
there's only scanlan and me in the house
if i get his promise and i'll let you know if i do i'd have the whole seven of you come to me by nine o'clock
we'll get him in
if ever he gets out alive well he can talk of birdy edwards's luck for the rest of his days
there's going to be a vacancy at pinkerton's or i'm mistaken
leave it at that mcmurdo
at nine to morrow we'll be with you
you once get the door shut behind him and you can leave the rest with us
as mcmurdo had said the house in which he lived was a lonely one and very well suited for such a crime as they had planned
it was on the extreme fringe of the town and stood well back from the road
in any other case the conspirators would have simply called out their man as they had many a time before and emptied their pistols into his body but in this instance it was very necessary to find out how much he knew how he knew it and what had been passed on to his employers
it was possible that they were already too late and that the work had been done
if that was indeed so they could at least have their revenge upon the man who had done it
but they were hopeful that nothing of great importance had yet come to the detective's knowledge as otherwise they argued he would not have troubled to write down and forward such trivial information as mcmurdo claimed to have given him
however all this they would learn from his own lips
once in their power they would find a way to make him speak
it was not the first time that they had handled an unwilling witness
mcmurdo went to hobson's patch as agreed
the police seemed to take particular interest in him that morning and captain marvin he who had claimed the old acquaintance with him at chicago actually addressed him as he waited at the station
mcmurdo turned away and refused to speak with him
he was back from his mission in the afternoon and saw mcginty at the union house
he is coming he said
good
said mcginty
the giant was in his shirt sleeves with chains and seals gleaming athwart his ample waistcoat and a diamond twinkling through the fringe of his bristling beard
drink and politics had made the boss a very rich as well as powerful man
the more terrible therefore seemed that glimpse of the prison or the gallows which had risen before him the night before
do you reckon he knows much
he asked anxiously
mcmurdo shook his head gloomily
he's been here some time six weeks at the least
i guess he didn't come into these parts to look at the prospect
if he has been working among us all that time with the railroad money at his back i should expect that he has got results and that he has passed them on
there's not a weak man in the lodge cried mcginty
true as steel every man of them
and yet by the lord
there is that skunk morris
what about him
if any man gives us away it would be he
i've a mind to send a couple of the boys round before evening to give him a beating up and see what they can get from him
well there would be no harm in that mcmurdo answered
i won't deny that i have a liking for morris and would be sorry to see him come to harm
he has spoken to me once or twice over lodge matters and though he may not see them the same as you or i he never seemed the sort that squeals
but still it is not for me to stand between him and you
i'll fix the old devil
said mcginty with an oath
i've had my eye on him this year past
well you know best about that mcmurdo answered
but whatever you do must be to morrow for we must lie low until the pinkerton affair is settled up
we can't afford to set the police buzzing to day of all days
true for you said mcginty
and we'll learn from birdy edwards himself where he got his news if we have to cut his heart out first
did he seem to scent a trap
mcmurdo laughed
i guess i took him on his weak point he said
if he could get on a good trail of the scowrers he's ready to follow it into hell
i took his money mcmurdo grinned as he produced a wad of dollar notes and as much more when he has seen all my papers
what papers
well there are no papers
but i filled him up about constitutions and books of rules and forms of membership
he expects to get right down to the end of everything before he leaves
faith he's right there said mcginty grimly
didn't he ask you why you didn't bring him the papers
as if i would carry such things and me a suspected man and captain marvin after speaking to me this very day at the depot
ay i heard of that said mcginty
i guess the heavy end of this business is coming on to you
we could put him down an old shaft when we've done with him but however we work it we can't get past the man living at hobson's patch and you being there to day
mcmurdo shrugged his shoulders
if we handle it right they can never prove the killing said he
no one can see him come to the house after dark and i'll lay to it that no one will see him go
now see here councillor i'll show you my plan and i'll ask you to fit the others into it
you will all come in good time
very well
he comes at ten
he is to tap three times and me to open the door for him
then i'll get behind him and shut it
he's our man then
that's all easy and plain
yes but the next step wants considering
he's a hard proposition
he's heavily armed
i've fooled him proper and yet he is likely to be on his guard
suppose i show him right into a room with seven men in it where he expected to find me alone
there is going to be shooting and somebody is going to be hurt
that's so
and the noise is going to bring every damned copper in the township on top of it
i guess you are right
this is how i should work it
you will all be in the big room same as you saw when you had a chat with me
i'll open the door for him show him into the parlour beside the door and leave him there while i get the papers
that will give me the chance of telling you how things are shaping
then i will go back to him with some faked papers
as he is reading them i will jump for him and get my grip on his pistol arm
you'll hear me call and in you will rush
the quicker the better for he is as strong a man as i and i may have more than i can manage
but i allow that i can hold him till you come
it's a good plan said mcginty
the lodge will owe you a debt for this
i guess when i move out of the chair i can put a name to the man that's coming after me
sure councillor i am little more than a recruit said mcmurdo but his face showed what he thought of the great man's compliment
when he had returned home he made his own preparations for the grim evening in front of him
first he cleaned oiled and loaded his smith wesson revolver
then he surveyed the room in which the detective was to be trapped
it was a large apartment with a long deal table in the centre and the big stove at one side
at each of the other sides were windows
there were no shutters on these only light curtains which drew across
mcmurdo examined these attentively
no doubt it must have struck him that the apartment was very exposed for so secret a meeting
yet its distance from the road made it of less consequence
finally he discussed the matter with his fellow lodger
scanlan though a scowrer was an inoffensive little man who was too weak to stand against the opinion of his comrades but was secretly horrified by the deeds of blood at which he had sometimes been forced to assist
mcmurdo told him shortly what was intended
and if i were you mike scanlan i would take a night off and keep clear of it
there will be bloody work here before morning
well indeed then mac scanlan answered
it's not the will but the nerve that is wanting in me
when i saw manager dunn go down at the colliery yonder it was just more than i could stand
i'm not made for it same as you or mcginty
if the lodge will think none the worse of me i'll just do as you advise and leave you to yourselves for the evening
the men came in good time as arranged
they were outwardly respectable citizens well clad and cleanly but a judge of faces would have read little hope for birdy edwards in those hard mouths and remorseless eyes
there was not a man in the room whose hands had not been reddened a dozen times before
they were as hardened to human murder as a butcher to sheep
foremost of course both in appearance and in guilt was the formidable boss
harraway the secretary was a lean bitter man with a long scraggy neck and nervous jerky limbs a man of incorruptible fidelity where the finances of the order were concerned and with no notion of justice or honesty to anyone beyond
the treasurer carter was a middle aged man with an impassive rather sulky expression and a yellow parchment skin
he was a capable organizer and the actual details of nearly every outrage had sprung from his plotting brain
the two willabys were men of action tall lithe young fellows with determined faces while their companion tiger cormac a heavy dark youth was feared even by his own comrades for the ferocity of his disposition
these were the men who assembled that night under the roof of mcmurdo for the killing of the pinkerton detective
their host had placed whisky upon the table and they had hastened to prime themselves for the work before them
baldwin and cormac were already half drunk and the liquor had brought out all their ferocity
cormac placed his hands on the stove for an instant it had been lighted for the nights were still cold
that will do said he with an oath
ay said baldwin catching his meaning
if he is strapped to that we will have the truth out of him
we'll have the truth out of him never fear said mcmurdo
he had nerves of steel this man for though the whole weight of the affair was on him his manner was as cool and unconcerned as ever
the others marked it and applauded
you are the one to handle him said the boss approvingly
not a warning will he get till your hand is on his throat
it's a pity there are no shutters to your windows
mcmurdo went from one to the other and drew the curtains tighter
sure no one can spy upon us now
it's close upon the hour
maybe he won't come
maybe he'll get a sniff of danger said the secretary
he'll come never fear mcmurdo answered
he is as eager to come as you can be to see him
hark to that
they all sat like wax figures some with their glasses arrested halfway to their lips
three loud knocks had sounded at the door
hush
mcmurdo raised his hand in caution
an exulting glance went round the circle and hands were laid upon hidden weapons
not a sound for your lives
mcmurdo whispered as he went from the room closing the door carefully behind him
with strained ears the murderers waited
they counted the steps of their comrade down the passage
then they heard him open the outer door
there were a few words as of greeting
then they were aware of a strange step inside and of an unfamiliar voice
an instant later came the slam of the door and the turning of the key in the lock
their prey was safe within the trap
tiger cormac laughed horribly and boss mcginty clapped his great hand across his mouth
be quiet you fool
he whispered
you'll be the undoing of us yet
there was a mutter of conversation from the next room
it seemed interminable
then the door opened and mcmurdo appeared his finger upon his lip
he came to the end of the table and looked round at them
a subtle change had come over him
his manner was as of one who has great work to do
his face had set into granite firmness
his eyes shone with a fierce excitement behind his spectacles
he had become a visible leader of men
they stared at him with eager interest but he said nothing
still with the same singular gaze he looked from man to man
well
cried boss mcginty at last
is he here
is birdy edwards here
yes mcmurdo answered slowly
birdy edwards is here
i am birdy edwards
there were ten seconds after that brief speech during which the room might have been empty so profound was the silence
the hissing of a kettle upon the stove rose sharp and strident to the ear
seven white faces all turned upward to this man who dominated them were set motionless with utter terror
then with a sudden shivering of glass a bristle of glistening rifle barrels broke through each window while the curtains were torn from their hangings
at the sight boss mcginty gave the roar of a wounded bear and plunged for the half opened door
a levelled revolver met him there with the stern blue eyes of captain marvin of the mine police gleaming behind the sights
the boss recoiled and fell back into his chair
you're safer there councillor said the man whom they had known as mcmurdo
and you baldwin if you don't take your hand off your pistol you'll cheat the hangman yet
pull it out or by the lord that made me there that will do
there are forty armed men round this house and you can figure it out for yourself what chance you have
take their pistols marvin
there was no possible resistance under the menace of those rifles
the men were disarmed
sulky sheepish and amazed they still sat round the table
i'd like to say a word to you before we separate said the man who had trapped them
i guess we may not meet again until you see me on the stand in the courthouse
i'll give you something to think over between now and then
you know me now for what i am
at last i can put my cards on the table
i am birdy edwards of pinkerton's
i was chosen to break up your gang
i had a hard and dangerous game to play
not a soul not one soul not my nearest and dearest knew that i was playing it
only captain marvin here and my employers knew that
but it's over to night thank god and i am the winner
the seven pale rigid faces looked up at him
there was unappeasable hatred in their eyes
he read the relentless threat
maybe you think that the game is not over yet
well i take my chance of that
anyhow some of you will take no further hand and there are sixty more besides yourselves that will see a jail this night
i'll tell you this that when i was put upon this job i never believed there was such a society as yours
i thought it was paper talk and that i would prove it so
they told me it was to do with the freemen so i went to chicago and was made one
then i was surer than ever that it was just paper talk for i found no harm in the society but a deal of good
still i had to carry out my job and i came to the coal valleys
when i reached this place i learned that i was wrong and that it wasn't a dime novel after all
so i stayed to look after it
i never killed a man in chicago
i never minted a dollar in my life
those i gave you were as good as any others but i never spent money better
but i knew the way into your good wishes and so i pretended to you that the law was after me
it all worked just as i thought
so i joined your infernal lodge and i took my share in your councils
maybe they will say that i was as bad as you
they can say what they like so long as i get you
but what is the truth
the night i joined you beat up old man stanger
i could not warn him for there was no time but i held your hand baldwin when you would have killed him
if ever i have suggested things so as to keep my place among you they were things which i knew i could prevent
i could not save dunn and menzies for i did not know enough but i will see that their murderers are hanged
i gave chester wilcox warning so that when i blew his house in he and his folk were in hiding
there was many a crime that i could not stop but if you look back and think how often your man came home the other road or was down in town when you went for him or stayed indoors when you thought he would come out you'll see my work
you blasted traitor
hissed mcginty through his closed teeth
ay john mcginty you may call me that if it eases your smart
you and your like have been the enemy of god and man in these parts
it took a man to get between you and the poor devils of men and women that you held under your grip
there was just one way of doing it and i did it
you call me a traitor but i guess there's many a thousand will call me a deliverer that went down into hell to save them
i've had three months of it
i wouldn't have three such months again if they let me loose in the treasury at washington for it
i had to stay till i had it all every man and every secret right here in this hand
i'd have waited a little longer if it hadn't come to my knowledge that my secret was coming out
a letter had come into the town that would have set you wise to it all
then i had to act and act quickly
i've nothing more to say to you except that when my time comes i'll die the easier when i think of the work i have done in this valley
now marvin i'll keep you no more
take them in and get it over
there is little more to tell
scanlan had been given a sealed note to be left at the address of miss ettie shafter a mission which he had accepted with a wink and a knowing smile
in the early hours of the morning a beautiful woman and a much muffled man boarded a special train which had been sent by the railroad company and made a swift unbroken journey out of the land of danger
it was the last time that ever either ettie or her lover set foot in the valley of fear
ten days later they were married in chicago with old jacob shafter as witness of the wedding
the trial of the scowrers was held far from the place where their adherents might have terrified the guardians of the law
in vain they struggled
in vain the money of the lodge money squeezed by blackmail out of the whole countryside was spent like water in the attempt to save them
that cold clear unimpassioned statement from one who knew every detail of their lives their organization and their crimes was unshaken by all the wiles of their defenders
at last after so many years they were broken and scattered
the cloud was lifted forever from the valley
mcginty met his fate upon the scaffold cringing and whining when the last hour came
eight of his chief followers shared his fate
fifty odd had various degrees of imprisonment
the work of birdy edwards was complete
and yet as he had guessed the game was not over yet
there was another hand to be played and yet another and another
ted baldwin for one had escaped the scaffold so had the willabys so had several others of the fiercest spirits of the gang
for ten years they were out of the world and then came a day when they were free once more a day which edwards who knew his men was very sure would be an end of his life of peace
they had sworn an oath on all that they thought holy to have his blood as a vengeance for their comrades
and well they strove to keep their vow
from chicago he was chased after two attempts so near success that it was sure that the third would get him
from chicago he went under a changed name to california and it was there that the light went for a time out of his life when ettie edwards died
once again he was nearly killed and once again under the name of douglas he worked in a lonely canyon where with an english partner named barker he amassed a fortune
at last there came a warning to him that the bloodhounds were on his track once more and he cleared only just in time for england
and thence came the john douglas who for a second time married a worthy mate and lived for five years as a sussex county gentleman a life which ended with the strange happenings of which we have heard
the police trial had passed in which the case of john douglas was referred to a higher court
so had the quarter sessions at which he was acquitted as having acted in self defense
get him out of england at any cost wrote holmes to the wife
there are forces here which may be more dangerous than those he has escaped
there is no safety for your husband in england
two months had gone by and the case had to some extent passed from our minds
then one morning there came an enigmatic note slipped into our letter box
dear me mr
holmes
dear me
said this singular epistle
there was neither superscription nor signature
i laughed at the quaint message but holmes showed unwonted seriousness
deviltry watson
he remarked and sat long with a clouded brow
late last night mrs
hudson our landlady brought up a message that a gentleman wished to see holmes and that the matter was of the utmost importance
close at the heels of his messenger came cecil barker our friend of the moated manor house
his face was drawn and haggard
i've had bad news terrible news mr
holmes said he
i feared as much said holmes
you have not had a cable have you
i have had a note from someone who has
it's poor douglas
they tell me his name is edwards but he will always be jack douglas of benito canyon to me
i told you that they started together for south africa in the palmyra three weeks ago
exactly
the ship reached cape town last night
i received this cable from mrs douglas this morning jack has been lost overboard in gale off st helena
no one knows how accident occurred ivy douglas
ha
it came like that did it
said holmes thoughtfully
well i've no doubt it was well stage managed
you mean that you think there was no accident
none in the world
he was murdered
surely
so i think also
these infernal scowrers this cursed vindictive nest of criminals no no my good sir said holmes
there is a master hand here
it is no case of sawed off shot guns and clumsy six shooters
you can tell an old master by the sweep of his brush
i can tell a moriarty when i see one
this crime is from london not from america
but for what motive
because it is done by a man who cannot afford to fail one whose whole unique position depends upon the fact that all he does must succeed
a great brain and a huge organization have been turned to the extinction of one man
it is crushing the nut with the hammer an absurd extravagance of energy but the nut is very effectually crushed all the same
how came this man to have anything to do with it
i can only say that the first word that ever came to us of the business was from one of his lieutenants
these americans were well advised
having an english job to do they took into partnership as any foreign criminal could do this great consultant in crime
from that moment their man was doomed
at first he would content himself by using his machinery in order to find their victim
then he would indicate how the matter might be treated
finally when he read in the reports of the failure of this agent he would step in himself with a master touch
you heard me warn this man at birlstone manor house that the coming danger was greater than the past
was i right
barker beat his head with his clenched fist in his impotent anger
do you tell me that we have to sit down under this
do you say that no one can ever get level with this king devil
no i don't say that said holmes and his eyes seemed to be looking far into the future
i don't say that he can't be beat
but you must give me time you must give me time
we all sat in silence for some minutes while those fateful eyes still strained to pierce the veil
in the year i took my degree of doctor of medicine of the university of london and proceeded to netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army
having completed my studies there i was duly attached to the fifth northumberland fusiliers as assistant surgeon
the regiment was stationed in india at the time and before i could join it the second afghan war had broken out
on landing at bombay i learned that my corps had advanced through the passes and was already deep in the enemy's country
i followed however with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself and succeeded in reaching candahar in safety where i found my regiment and at once entered upon my new duties
the campaign brought honours and promotion to many but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster
i was removed from my brigade and attached to the berkshires with whom i served at the fatal battle of maiwand
there i was struck on the shoulder by a jezail bullet which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery
i should have fallen into the hands of the murderous ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by murray my orderly who threw me across a pack horse and succeeded in bringing me safely to the british lines
worn with pain and weak from the prolonged hardships which i had undergone i was removed with a great train of wounded sufferers to the base hospital at peshawar
here i rallied and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards and even to bask a little upon the verandah when i was struck down by enteric fever that curse of our indian possessions
for months my life was despaired of and when at last i came to myself and became convalescent i was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to england
i was dispatched accordingly in the troopship orontes and landed a month later on portsmouth jetty with my health irretrievably ruined but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it
i had neither kith nor kin in england and was therefore as free as air or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be
under such circumstances i naturally gravitated to london that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the empire are irresistibly drained
there i stayed for some time at a private hotel in the strand leading a comfortless meaningless existence and spending such money as i had considerably more freely than i ought
so alarming did the state of my finances become that i soon realized that i must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country or that i must make a complete alteration in my style of living
choosing the latter alternative i began by making up my mind to leave the hotel and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile
on the very day that i had come to this conclusion i was standing at the criterion bar when some one tapped me on the shoulder and turning round i recognized young stamford who had been a dresser under me at barts
the sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of london is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man
in old days stamford had never been a particular crony of mine but now i hailed him with enthusiasm and he in his turn appeared to be delighted to see me
in the exuberance of my joy i asked him to lunch with me at the holborn and we started off together in a hansom
whatever have you been doing with yourself watson
he asked in undisguised wonder as we rattled through the crowded london streets
you are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut
i gave him a short sketch of my adventures and had hardly concluded it by the time that we reached our destination
poor devil
he said commiseratingly after he had listened to my misfortunes
what are you up to now
looking for lodgings
i answered
trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price
that's a strange thing remarked my companion you are the second man to day that has used that expression to me
and who was the first
i asked
a fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital
he was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found and which were too much for his purse
by jove
i cried if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense i am the very man for him
i should prefer having a partner to being alone
young stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine glass
you don't know sherlock holmes yet he said perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion
why what is there against him
oh i didn't say there was anything against him
he is a little queer in his ideas an enthusiast in some branches of science
as far as i know he is a decent fellow enough
a medical student i suppose
said i
no i have no idea what he intends to go in for
i believe he is well up in anatomy and he is a first class chemist but as far as i know he has never taken out any systematic medical classes
his studies are very desultory and eccentric but he has amassed a lot of out of the way knowledge which would astonish his professors
did you never ask him what he was going in for
i asked
no he is not a man that it is easy to draw out though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him
i should like to meet him i said
if i am to lodge with anyone i should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits
i am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement
i had enough of both in afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence
how could i meet this friend of yours
he is sure to be at the laboratory returned my companion
he either avoids the place for weeks or else he works there from morning to night
if you like we shall drive round together after luncheon
certainly i answered and the conversation drifted away into other channels
as we made our way to the hospital after leaving the holborn stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom i proposed to take as a fellow lodger
you mustn't blame me if you don't get on with him he said i know nothing more of him than i have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory
you proposed this arrangement so you must not hold me responsible
if we don't get on it will be easy to part company i answered
it seems to me stamford i added looking hard at my companion that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter
is this fellow's temper so formidable or what is it
don't be mealy mouthed about it
it is not easy to express the inexpressible he answered with a laugh
holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes it approaches to cold bloodedness
i could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid not out of malevolence you understand but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects
to do him justice i think that he would take it himself with the same readiness
he appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge
very right too
yes but it may be pushed to excess
when it comes to beating the subjects in the dissecting rooms with a stick it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape
beating the subjects
yes to verify how far bruises may be produced after death
i saw him at it with my own eyes
and yet you say he is not a medical student
no
heaven knows what the objects of his studies are
but here we are and you must form your own impressions about him
as he spoke we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side door which opened into a wing of the great hospital
it was familiar ground to me and i needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and dun coloured doors
near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory
this was a lofty chamber lined and littered with countless bottles
broad low tables were scattered about which bristled with retorts test tubes and little bunsen lamps with their blue flickering flames
there was only one student in the room who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work
at the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure
i've found it
i've found it he shouted to my companion running towards us with a test tube in his hand
i have found a re agent which is precipitated by hoemoglobin and by nothing else
had he discovered a gold mine greater delight could not have shone upon his features
dr
watson mr
sherlock holmes said stamford introducing us
how are you
he said cordially gripping my hand with a strength for which i should hardly have given him credit
you have been in afghanistan i perceive
how on earth did you know that
i asked in astonishment
never mind said he chuckling to himself
the question now is about hoemoglobin
no doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine
it is interesting chemically no doubt i answered but practically why man it is the most practical medico legal discovery for years
don't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains
come over here now
he seized me by the coat sleeve in his eagerness and drew me over to the table at which he had been working
let us have some fresh blood he said digging a long bodkin into his finger and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette
now i add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water
you perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water
the proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million
i have no doubt however that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction
as he spoke he threw into the vessel a few white crystals and then added some drops of a transparent fluid
in an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany colour and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar
ha
ha
he cried clapping his hands and looking as delighted as a child with a new toy
what do you think of that
it seems to be a very delicate test i remarked
beautiful
beautiful
the old guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain
so is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles
the latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old
now this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new
had this test been invented there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes
indeed
i murmured
criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point
a man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed
his linen or clothes are examined and brownish stains discovered upon them
are they blood stains or mud stains or rust stains or fruit stains or what are they
that is a question which has puzzled many an expert and why
because there was no reliable test
now we have the sherlock holmes' test and there will no longer be any difficulty
his eyes fairly glittered as he spoke and he put his hand over his heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination
you are to be congratulated i remarked considerably surprised at his enthusiasm
there was the case of von bischoff at frankfort last year
he would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence
then there was mason of bradford and the notorious muller and lefevre of montpellier and samson of new orleans
i could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive
you seem to be a walking calendar of crime said stamford with a laugh
you might start a paper on those lines
call it the 'police news of the past '
very interesting reading it might be made too remarked sherlock holmes sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger
i have to be careful he continued turning to me with a smile for i dabble with poisons a good deal
he held out his hand as he spoke and i noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster and discoloured with strong acids
we came here on business said stamford sitting down on a high three legged stool and pushing another one in my direction with his foot
my friend here wants to take diggings and as you were complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you i thought that i had better bring you together
sherlock holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me
i have my eye on a suite in baker street he said which would suit us down to the ground
you don't mind the smell of strong tobacco i hope
i always smoke 'ship's' myself i answered
that's good enough
i generally have chemicals about and occasionally do experiments
would that annoy you
by no means
let me see what are my other shortcomings
i get in the dumps at times and don't open my mouth for days on end
you must not think i am sulky when i do that
just let me alone and i'll soon be right
what have you to confess now
it's just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together
i laughed at this cross examination
i keep a bull pup i said and i object to rows because my nerves are shaken and i get up at all sorts of ungodly hours and i am extremely lazy
i have another set of vices when i'm well but those are the principal ones at present
do you include violin playing in your category of rows
he asked anxiously
it depends on the player i answered
a well played violin is a treat for the gods a badly played one oh that's all right he cried with a merry laugh
i think we may consider the thing as settled that is if the rooms are agreeable to you
when shall we see them
call for me here at noon to morrow and we'll go together and settle everything he answered
all right noon exactly said i shaking his hand
we left him working among his chemicals and we walked together towards my hotel
by the way i asked suddenly stopping and turning upon stamford how the deuce did he know that i had come from afghanistan
my companion smiled an enigmatical smile
that's just his little peculiarity he said
a good many people have wanted to know how he finds things out
oh
a mystery is it
i cried rubbing my hands
this is very piquant
i am much obliged to you for bringing us together
'the proper study of mankind is man ' you know
you must study him then stamford said as he bade me good bye
you'll find him a knotty problem though
i'll wager he learns more about you than you about him
good bye
good bye i answered and strolled on to my hotel considerably interested in my new acquaintance
we met next day as he had arranged and inspected the rooms at no
221b baker street of which he had spoken at our meeting
they consisted of a couple of comfortable bed rooms and a single large airy sitting room cheerfully furnished and illuminated by two broad windows
so desirable in every way were the apartments and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us that the bargain was concluded upon the spot and we at once entered into possession
that very evening i moved my things round from the hotel and on the following morning sherlock holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus
for a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage
that done we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings
holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with
he was quiet in his ways and his habits were regular
it was rare for him to be up after ten at night and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before i rose in the morning
sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory sometimes in the dissecting rooms and occasionally in long walks which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the city
nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him but now and again a reaction would seize him and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting room hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night
on these occasions i have noticed such a dreamy vacant expression in his eyes that i might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion
as the weeks went by my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in life gradually deepened and increased
his very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer
in height he was rather over six feet and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller
his eyes were sharp and piercing save during those intervals of torpor to which i have alluded and his thin hawk like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision
his chin too had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination
his hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch as i frequently had occasion to observe when i watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments
the reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody when i confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity and how often i endeavoured to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself
before pronouncing judgment however be it remembered how objectless was my life and how little there was to engage my attention
my health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial and i had no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence
under these circumstances i eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it
he was not studying medicine
he had himself in reply to a question confirmed stamford's opinion upon that point
neither did he appear to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance into the learned world
yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me
surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some definite end in view
desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning
no man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason for doing so
his ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge
of contemporary literature philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing
upon my quoting thomas carlyle he inquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had done
my surprise reached a climax however when i found incidentally that he was ignorant of the copernican theory and of the composition of the solar system
that any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that i could hardly realize it
you appear to be astonished he said smiling at my expression of surprise
now that i do know it i shall do my best to forget it
to forget it
you see he explained i consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose
a fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it
now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain attic
he will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work but of these he has a large assortment and all in the most perfect order
it is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent
depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before
it is of the highest importance therefore not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones
but the solar system
i protested
what the deuce is it to me
he interrupted impatiently you say that we go round the sun
if we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work
i was on the point of asking him what that work might be but something in his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one
i pondered over our short conversation however and endeavoured to draw my deductions from it
he said that he would acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his object
therefore all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to him
i enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was exceptionally well informed
i even took a pencil and jotted them down
i could not help smiling at the document when i had completed it
it ran in this way sherlock holmes his limits

knowledge of literature nil

philosophy nil

astronomy nil

politics feeble

botany variable
well up in belladonna opium and poisons generally
knows nothing of practical gardening

geology practical but limited
tells at a glance different soils from each other
after walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers and told me by their colour and consistence in what part of london he had received them

chemistry profound

anatomy accurate but unsystematic

sensational literature immense
he appears to know every detail of every horror perpetrated in the century

plays the violin well

is an expert singlestick player boxer and swordsman

has a good practical knowledge of british law
when i had got so far in my list i threw it into the fire in despair
if i can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all these accomplishments and discovering a calling which needs them all i said to myself i may as well give up the attempt at once
i see that i have alluded above to his powers upon the violin
these were very remarkable but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments
that he could play pieces and difficult pieces i knew well because at my request he has played me some of mendelssohn's lieder and other favourites
when left to himself however he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air
leaning back in his arm chair of an evening he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee
sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy
occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful
clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him but whether the music aided those thoughts or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than i could determine
i might have rebelled against these exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation for the trial upon my patience
during the first week or so we had no callers and i had begun to think that my companion was as friendless a man as i was myself
presently however i found that he had many acquaintances and those in the most different classes of society
there was one little sallow rat faced dark eyed fellow who was introduced to me as mr
lestrade and who came three or four times in a single week
one morning a young girl called fashionably dressed and stayed for half an hour or more
the same afternoon brought a grey headed seedy visitor looking like a jew pedlar who appeared to me to be much excited and who was closely followed by a slip shod elderly woman
on another occasion an old white haired gentleman had an interview with my companion and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform
when any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance sherlock holmes used to beg for the use of the sitting room and i would retire to my bed room
he always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience
i have to use this room as a place of business he said and these people are my clients
again i had an opportunity of asking him a point blank question and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me
i imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for not alluding to it but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to the subject of his own accord
it was upon the 4th of march as i have good reason to remember that i rose somewhat earlier than usual and found that sherlock holmes had not yet finished his breakfast
the landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared
with the unreasonable petulance of mankind i rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that i was ready
then i picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it while my companion munched silently at his toast
one of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading and i naturally began to run my eye through it
its somewhat ambitious title was the book of life and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way
it struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity
the reasoning was close and intense but the deductions appeared to me to be far fetched and exaggerated
the writer claimed by a momentary expression a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye to fathom a man's inmost thoughts
deceit according to him was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis
his conclusions were as infallible as so many propositions of euclid
so startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer
from a drop of water said the writer a logician could infer the possibility of an atlantic or a niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other
so all life is a great chain the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it
like all other arts the science of deduction and analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it
before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest difficulties let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary problems
let him on meeting a fellow mortal learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man and the trade or profession to which he belongs
puerile as such an exercise may seem it sharpens the faculties of observation and teaches one where to look and what to look for
by a man's finger nails by his coat sleeve by his boot by his trouser knees by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb by his expression by his shirt cuffs by each of these things a man's calling is plainly revealed
that all united should fail to enlighten the competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable
what ineffable twaddle
i cried slapping the magazine down on the table i never read such rubbish in my life
what is it
asked sherlock holmes
why this article i said pointing at it with my egg spoon as i sat down to my breakfast
i see that you have read it since you have marked it
i don't deny that it is smartly written
it irritates me though
it is evidently the theory of some arm chair lounger who evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study
it is not practical
i should like to see him clapped down in a third class carriage on the underground and asked to give the trades of all his fellow travellers
i would lay a thousand to one against him
you would lose your money sherlock holmes remarked calmly
as for the article i wrote it myself
you
yes i have a turn both for observation and for deduction
the theories which i have expressed there and which appear to you to be so chimerical are really extremely practical so practical that i depend upon them for my bread and cheese
and how
i asked involuntarily
well i have a trade of my own
i suppose i am the only one in the world
i'm a consulting detective if you can understand what that is
here in london we have lots of government detectives and lots of private ones
when these fellows are at fault they come to me and i manage to put them on the right scent
they lay all the evidence before me and i am generally able by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime to set them straight
there is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger ends it is odd if you can't unravel the thousand and first
lestrade is a well known detective
he got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case and that was what brought him here
and these other people
they are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies
they are all people who are in trouble about something and want a little enlightening
i listen to their story they listen to my comments and then i pocket my fee
but do you mean to say i said that without leaving your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of although they have seen every detail for themselves
quite so
i have a kind of intuition that way
now and again a case turns up which is a little more complex
then i have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes
you see i have a lot of special knowledge which i apply to the problem and which facilitates matters wonderfully
those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn are invaluable to me in practical work
observation with me is second nature
you appeared to be surprised when i told you on our first meeting that you had come from afghanistan
you were told no doubt
nothing of the sort
i _knew_ you came from afghanistan
from long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind that i arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps
there were such steps however
the train of reasoning ran 'here is a gentleman of a medical type but with the air of a military man
clearly an army doctor then
he has just come from the tropics for his face is dark and that is not the natural tint of his skin for his wrists are fair
he has undergone hardship and sickness as his haggard face says clearly
his left arm has been injured
he holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner
where in the tropics could an english army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded
clearly in afghanistan '
the whole train of thought did not occupy a second
i then remarked that you came from afghanistan and you were astonished
it is simple enough as you explain it i said smiling
you remind me of edgar allen poe's dupin
i had no idea that such individuals did exist outside of stories
sherlock holmes rose and lit his pipe
no doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to dupin he observed
now in my opinion dupin was a very inferior fellow
that trick of his of breaking in on his friends' thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour's silence is really very showy and superficial
he had some analytical genius no doubt but he was by no means such a phenomenon as poe appeared to imagine
have you read gaboriau's works
i asked
does lecoq come up to your idea of a detective
sherlock holmes sniffed sardonically
lecoq was a miserable bungler he said in an angry voice he had only one thing to recommend him and that was his energy
that book made me positively ill
the question was how to identify an unknown prisoner
i could have done it in twenty four hours
lecoq took six months or so
it might be made a text book for detectives to teach them what to avoid
i felt rather indignant at having two characters whom i had admired treated in this cavalier style
i walked over to the window and stood looking out into the busy street
this fellow may be very clever i said to myself but he is certainly very conceited
there are no crimes and no criminals in these days he said querulously
what is the use of having brains in our profession
i know well that i have it in me to make my name famous
no man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which i have done
and what is the result
there is no crime to detect or at most some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a scotland yard official can see through it
i was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation
i thought it best to change the topic
i wonder what that fellow is looking for
i asked pointing to a stalwart plainly dressed individual who was walking slowly down the other side of the street looking anxiously at the numbers
he had a large blue envelope in his hand and was evidently the bearer of a message
you mean the retired sergeant of marines said sherlock holmes
brag and bounce
thought i to myself
he knows that i cannot verify his guess
the thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were watching caught sight of the number on our door and ran rapidly across the roadway
we heard a loud knock a deep voice below and heavy steps ascending the stair
for mr
sherlock holmes he said stepping into the room and handing my friend the letter
here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him
he little thought of this when he made that random shot
may i ask my lad i said in the blandest voice what your trade may be
commissionaire sir he said gruffly
uniform away for repairs
and you were
i asked with a slightly malicious glance at my companion
a sergeant sir royal marine light infantry sir
no answer
right sir
he clicked his heels together raised his hand in a salute and was gone
i confess that i was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the practical nature of my companion's theories
my respect for his powers of analysis increased wondrously
there still remained some lurking suspicion in my mind however that the whole thing was a pre arranged episode intended to dazzle me though what earthly object he could have in taking me in was past my comprehension
when i looked at him he had finished reading the note and his eyes had assumed the vacant lack lustre expression which showed mental abstraction
how in the world did you deduce that
i asked
deduce what
said he petulantly
why that he was a retired sergeant of marines
i have no time for trifles he answered brusquely then with a smile excuse my rudeness
you broke the thread of my thoughts but perhaps it is as well
so you actually were not able to see that that man was a sergeant of marines
no indeed
it was easier to know it than to explain why i knew it
if you were asked to prove that two and two made four you might find some difficulty and yet you are quite sure of the fact
even across the street i could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the fellow's hand
that smacked of the sea
he had a military carriage however and regulation side whiskers
there we have the marine
he was a man with some amount of self importance and a certain air of command
you must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his cane
a steady respectable middle aged man too on the face of him all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant
wonderful
i ejaculated
commonplace said holmes though i thought from his expression that he was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration
i said just now that there were no criminals
it appears that i am wrong look at this
he threw me over the note which the commissionaire had brought
why i cried as i cast my eye over it this is terrible
it does seem to be a little out of the common he remarked calmly
would you mind reading it to me aloud
this is the letter which i read to him my dear mr
sherlock holmes there has been a bad business during the night at lauriston gardens off the brixton road
our man on the beat saw a light there about two in the morning and as the house was an empty one suspected that something was amiss
he found the door open and in the front room which is bare of furniture discovered the body of a gentleman well dressed and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of 'enoch j drebber cleveland ohio u s a '
there had been no robbery nor is there any evidence as to how the man met his death
there are marks of blood in the room but there is no wound upon his person
we are at a loss as to how he came into the empty house indeed the whole affair is a puzzler
if you can come round to the house any time before twelve you will find me there
i have left everything _in statu quo_ until i hear from you
if you are unable to come i shall give you fuller details and would esteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion
yours faithfully tobias gregson
gregson is the smartest of the scotland yarders my friend remarked he and lestrade are the pick of a bad lot
they are both quick and energetic but conventional shockingly so
they have their knives into one another too
they are as jealous as a pair of professional beauties
there will be some fun over this case if they are both put upon the scent
i was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on
surely there is not a moment to be lost i cried shall i go and order you a cab
i'm not sure about whether i shall go
i am the most incurably lazy devil that ever stood in shoe leather that is when the fit is on me for i can be spry enough at times
why it is just such a chance as you have been longing for
my dear fellow what does it matter to me
supposing i unravel the whole matter you may be sure that gregson lestrade and co
will pocket all the credit
that comes of being an unofficial personage
but he begs you to help him
yes
he knows that i am his superior and acknowledges it to me but he would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person
however we may as well go and have a look
i shall work it out on my own hook
i may have a laugh at them if i have nothing else
come on
he hustled on his overcoat and bustled about in a way that showed that an energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one
get your hat he said
you wish me to come
yes if you have nothing better to do
a minute later we were both in a hansom driving furiously for the brixton road
it was a foggy cloudy morning and a dun coloured veil hung over the house tops looking like the reflection of the mud coloured streets beneath
my companion was in the best of spirits and prattled away about cremona fiddles and the difference between a stradivarius and an amati
as for myself i was silent for the dull weather and the melancholy business upon which we were engaged depressed my spirits
you don't seem to give much thought to the matter in hand i said at last interrupting holmes' musical disquisition
no data yet he answered
it is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence
it biases the judgment
you will have your data soon i remarked pointing with my finger this is the brixton road and that is the house if i am not very much mistaken
so it is
stop driver stop
we were still a hundred yards or so from it but he insisted upon our alighting and we finished our journey upon foot
number lauriston gardens wore an ill omened and minatory look
it was one of four which stood back some little way from the street two being occupied and two empty
the latter looked out with three tiers of vacant melancholy windows which were blank and dreary save that here and there a to let card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared panes
a small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street and was traversed by a narrow pathway yellowish in colour and consisting apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel
the whole place was very sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night
the garden was bounded by a three foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable surrounded by a small knot of loafers who craned their necks and strained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within
i had imagined that sherlock holmes would at once have hurried into the house and plunged into a study of the mystery
nothing appeared to be further from his intention
with an air of nonchalance which under the circumstances seemed to me to border upon affectation he lounged up and down the pavement and gazed vacantly at the ground the sky the opposite houses and the line of railings
having finished his scrutiny he proceeded slowly down the path or rather down the fringe of grass which flanked the path keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground
twice he stopped and once i saw him smile and heard him utter an exclamation of satisfaction
there were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil but since the police had been coming and going over it i was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it
still i had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties that i had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden from me
at the door of the house we were met by a tall white faced flaxen haired man with a notebook in his hand who rushed forward and wrung my companion's hand with effusion
it is indeed kind of you to come he said i have had everything left untouched
except that
my friend answered pointing at the pathway
if a herd of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess
no doubt however you had drawn your own conclusions gregson before you permitted this
i have had so much to do inside the house the detective said evasively
my colleague mr
lestrade is here
i had relied upon him to look after this
holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically
with two such men as yourself and lestrade upon the ground there will not be much for a third party to find out he said
gregson rubbed his hands in a self satisfied way
i think we have done all that can be done he answered it's a queer case though and i knew your taste for such things
you did not come here in a cab
asked sherlock holmes
no sir
nor lestrade
no sir
then let us go and look at the room
with which inconsequent remark he strode on into the house followed by gregson whose features expressed his astonishment
a short passage bare planked and dusty led to the kitchen and offices
two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right
one of these had obviously been closed for many weeks
the other belonged to the dining room which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred
holmes walked in and i followed him with that subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires
it was a large square room looking all the larger from the absence of all furniture
a vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls but it was blotched in places with mildew and here and there great strips had become detached and hung down exposing the yellow plaster beneath
opposite the door was a showy fireplace surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble
on one corner of this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle
the solitary window was so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain giving a dull grey tinge to everything which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment
all these details i observed afterwards
at present my attention was centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured ceiling
it was that of a man about forty three or forty four years of age middle sized broad shouldered with crisp curling black hair and a short stubbly beard
he was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat with light coloured trousers and immaculate collar and cuffs
a top hat well brushed and trim was placed upon the floor beside him
his hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad while his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one
on his rigid face there stood an expression of horror and as it seemed to me of hatred such as i have never seen upon human features
this malignant and terrible contortion combined with the low forehead blunt nose and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and ape like appearance which was increased by his writhing unnatural posture
i have seen death in many forms but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban london
lestrade lean and ferret like as ever was standing by the doorway and greeted my companion and myself
this case will make a stir sir he remarked
it beats anything i have seen and i am no chicken
there is no clue
said gregson
none at all chimed in lestrade
sherlock holmes approached the body and kneeling down examined it intently
you are sure that there is no wound
he asked pointing to numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round
positive
cried both detectives
then of course this blood belongs to a second individual presumably the murderer if murder has been committed
it reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of van jansen in utrecht in the year '
do you remember the case gregson
no sir
read it up you really should
there is nothing new under the sun
it has all been done before
as he spoke his nimble fingers were flying here there and everywhere feeling pressing unbuttoning examining while his eyes wore the same far away expression which i have already remarked upon
so swiftly was the examination made that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness with which it was conducted
finally he sniffed the dead man's lips and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots
he has not been moved at all
he asked
no more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination
you can take him to the mortuary now he said
there is nothing more to be learned
gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand
at his call they entered the room and the stranger was lifted and carried out
as they raised him a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor
lestrade grabbed it up and stared at it with mystified eyes
there's been a woman here he cried
it's a woman's wedding ring
he held it out as he spoke upon the palm of his hand
we all gathered round him and gazed at it
there could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride
this complicates matters said gregson
heaven knows they were complicated enough before
you're sure it doesn't simplify them
observed holmes
there's nothing to be learned by staring at it
what did you find in his pockets
we have it all here said gregson pointing to a litter of objects upon one of the bottom steps of the stairs
a gold watch no
by barraud of london
gold albert chain very heavy and solid
gold ring with masonic device
gold pin bull dog's head with rubies as eyes
russian leather card case with cards of enoch j drebber of cleveland corresponding with the e j d upon the linen
no purse but loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen
pocket edition of boccaccio's 'decameron ' with name of joseph stangerson upon the fly leaf
two letters one addressed to e j drebber and one to joseph stangerson
at what address
american exchange strand to be left till called for
they are both from the guion steamship company and refer to the sailing of their boats from liverpool
it is clear that this unfortunate man was about to return to new york
have you made any inquiries as to this man stangerson
i did it at once sir said gregson
i have had advertisements sent to all the newspapers and one of my men has gone to the american exchange but he has not returned yet
have you sent to cleveland
we telegraphed this morning
how did you word your inquiries
we simply detailed the circumstances and said that we should be glad of any information which could help us
you did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to be crucial
i asked about stangerson
nothing else
is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears to hinge
will you not telegraph again
i have said all i have to say said gregson in an offended voice
sherlock holmes chuckled to himself and appeared to be about to make some remark when lestrade who had been in the front room while we were holding this conversation in the hall reappeared upon the scene rubbing his hands in a pompous and self satisfied manner
mr
gregson he said i have just made a discovery of the highest importance and one which would have been overlooked had i not made a careful examination of the walls
the little man's eyes sparkled as he spoke and he was evidently in a state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his colleague
come here he said bustling back into the room the atmosphere of which felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate
now stand there
he struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall
look at that
he said triumphantly
i have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts
in this particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off leaving a yellow square of coarse plastering
across this bare space there was scrawled in blood red letters a single word rache
what do you think of that
cried the detective with the air of a showman exhibiting his show
this was overlooked because it was in the darkest corner of the room and no one thought of looking there
the murderer has written it with his or her own blood
see this smear where it has trickled down the wall
that disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow
why was that corner chosen to write it on
i will tell you
see that candle on the mantelpiece
it was lit at the time and if it was lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of the wall
and what does it mean now that you _have_ found it
asked gregson in a depreciatory voice
mean
why it means that the writer was going to put the female name rachel but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish
you mark my words when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a woman named rachel has something to do with it
it's all very well for you to laugh mr
sherlock holmes
you may be very smart and clever but the old hound is the best when all is said and done
i really beg your pardon
said my companion who had ruffled the little man's temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter
you certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out and as you say it bears every mark of having been written by the other participant in last night's mystery
i have not had time to examine this room yet but with your permission i shall do so now
as he spoke he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying glass from his pocket
with these two implements he trotted noiselessly about the room sometimes stopping occasionally kneeling and once lying flat upon his face
so engrossed was he with his occupation that he appeared to have forgotten our presence for he chattered away to himself under his breath the whole time keeping up a running fire of exclamations groans whistles and little cries suggestive of encouragement and of hope
as i watched him i was irresistibly reminded of a pure blooded well trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and forwards through the covert whining in its eagerness until it comes across the lost scent
for twenty minutes or more he continued his researches measuring with the most exact care the distance between marks which were entirely invisible to me and occasionally applying his tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner
in one place he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor and packed it away in an envelope
finally he examined with his glass the word upon the wall going over every letter of it with the most minute exactness
this done he appeared to be satisfied for he replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket
they say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains he remarked with a smile
it's a very bad definition but it does apply to detective work
gregson and lestrade had watched the manoeuvres of their amateur companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt
they evidently failed to appreciate the fact which i had begun to realize that sherlock holmes' smallest actions were all directed towards some definite and practical end
what do you think of it sir
they both asked
it would be robbing you of the credit of the case if i was to presume to help you remarked my friend
you are doing so well now that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere
there was a world of sarcasm in his voice as he spoke
if you will let me know how your investigations go he continued i shall be happy to give you any help i can
in the meantime i should like to speak to the constable who found the body
can you give me his name and address
lestrade glanced at his note book
john rance he said
he is off duty now
you will find him at audley court kennington park gate
holmes took a note of the address
come along doctor he said we shall go and look him up
i'll tell you one thing which may help you in the case he continued turning to the two detectives
there has been murder done and the murderer was a man
he was more than six feet high was in the prime of life had small feet for his height wore coarse square toed boots and smoked a trichinopoly cigar
he came here with his victim in a four wheeled cab which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg
in all probability the murderer had a florid face and the finger nails of his right hand were remarkably long
these are only a few indications but they may assist you
lestrade and gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile
if this man was murdered how was it done
asked the former
poison said sherlock holmes curtly and strode off
one other thing lestrade he added turning round at the door 'rache ' is the german for 'revenge ' so don't lose your time looking for miss rachel
with which parthian shot he walked away leaving the two rivals open mouthed behind him
it was one o'clock when we left no
lauriston gardens
sherlock holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office whence he dispatched a long telegram
he then hailed a cab and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by lestrade
there is nothing like first hand evidence he remarked as a matter of fact my mind is entirely made up upon the case but still we may as well learn all that is to be learned
you amaze me holmes said i
surely you are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave
there's no room for a mistake he answered
the very first thing which i observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the curb
now up to last night we have had no rain for a week so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night
there were the marks of the horse's hoofs too the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three showing that that was a new shoe
since the cab was there after the rain began and was not there at any time during the morning i have gregson's word for that it follows that it must have been there during the night and therefore that it brought those two individuals to the house
that seems simple enough said i but how about the other man's height
why the height of a man in nine cases out of ten can be told from the length of his stride
it is a simple calculation enough though there is no use my boring you with figures
i had this fellow's stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within
then i had a way of checking my calculation
when a man writes on a wall his instinct leads him to write about the level of his own eyes
now that writing was just over six feet from the ground
it was child's play
and his age
i asked
well if a man can stride four and a half feet without the smallest effort he can't be quite in the sere and yellow
that was the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across
patent leather boots had gone round and square toes had hopped over
there is no mystery about it at all
i am simply applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which i advocated in that article
is there anything else that puzzles you
the finger nails and the trichinopoly i suggested
the writing on the wall was done with a man's forefinger dipped in blood
my glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it which would not have been the case if the man's nail had been trimmed
i gathered up some scattered ash from the floor
it was dark in colour and flakey such an ash as is only made by a trichinopoly
i have made a special study of cigar ashes in fact i have written a monograph upon the subject
i flatter myself that i can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand either of cigar or of tobacco
it is just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the gregson and lestrade type
and the florid face
i asked
ah that was a more daring shot though i have no doubt that i was right
you must not ask me that at the present state of the affair
i passed my hand over my brow
my head is in a whirl i remarked the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows
how came these two men if there were two men into an empty house
what has become of the cabman who drove them
how could one man compel another to take poison
where did the blood come from
what was the object of the murderer since robbery had no part in it
how came the woman's ring there
above all why should the second man write up the german word rache before decamping
i confess that i cannot see any possible way of reconciling all these facts
my companion smiled approvingly
you sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well he said
there is much that is still obscure though i have quite made up my mind on the main facts
as to poor lestrade's discovery it was simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track by suggesting socialism and secret societies
it was not done by a german
the a if you noticed was printed somewhat after the german fashion
now a real german invariably prints in the latin character so that we may safely say that this was not written by one but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part
it was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel
i'm not going to tell you much more of the case doctor
you know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick and if i show you too much of my method of working you will come to the conclusion that i am a very ordinary individual after all
i shall never do that i answered you have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world
my companion flushed up with pleasure at my words and the earnest way in which i uttered them
i had already observed that he was as sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty
i'll tell you one other thing he said
patent leathers and square toes came in the same cab and they walked down the pathway together as friendly as possible arm in arm in all probability
when they got inside they walked up and down the room or rather patent leathers stood still while square toes walked up and down
i could read all that in the dust and i could read that as he walked he grew more and more excited
that is shown by the increased length of his strides
he was talking all the while and working himself up no doubt into a fury
then the tragedy occurred
i've told you all i know myself now for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture
we have a good working basis however on which to start
we must hurry up for i want to go to halle's concert to hear norman neruda this afternoon
this conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by ways
in the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand
that's audley court in there he said pointing to a narrow slit in the line of dead coloured brick
you'll find me here when you come back
audley court was not an attractive locality
the narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings
we picked our way among groups of dirty children and through lines of discoloured linen until we came to number the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name rance was engraved
on enquiry we found that the constable was in bed and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming
he appeared presently looking a little irritable at being disturbed in his slumbers
i made my report at the office he said
holmes took a half sovereign from his pocket and played with it pensively
we thought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips he said
i shall be most happy to tell you anything i can the constable answered with his eyes upon the little golden disk
just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred
rance sat down on the horsehair sofa and knitted his brows as though determined not to omit anything in his narrative
i'll tell it ye from the beginning he said
my time is from ten at night to six in the morning
at eleven there was a fight at the 'white hart' but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat
at one o'clock it began to rain and i met harry murcher him who has the holland grove beat and we stood together at the corner of henrietta street a talkin'
presently maybe about two or a little after i thought i would take a look round and see that all was right down the brixton road
it was precious dirty and lonely
not a soul did i meet all the way down though a cab or two went past me
i was a strollin' down thinkin' between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same house
now i knew that them two houses in lauriston gardens was empty on account of him that owns them who won't have the drains seen to though the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o' typhoid fever
i was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the window and i suspected as something was wrong
when i got to the door you stopped and then walked back to the garden gate my companion interrupted
what did you do that for
rance gave a violent jump and stared at sherlock holmes with the utmost amazement upon his features
why that's true sir he said though how you come to know it heaven only knows
ye see when i got up to the door it was so still and so lonesome that i thought i'd be none the worse for some one with me
i ain't afeared of anything on this side o' the grave but i thought that maybe it was him that died o' the typhoid inspecting the drains what killed him
the thought gave me a kind o' turn and i walked back to the gate to see if i could see murcher's lantern but there wasn't no sign of him nor of anyone else
there was no one in the street
not a livin' soul sir nor as much as a dog
then i pulled myself together and went back and pushed the door open
all was quiet inside so i went into the room where the light was a burnin'
there was a candle flickerin' on the mantelpiece a red wax one and by its light i saw yes i know all that you saw
you walked round the room several times and you knelt down by the body and then you walked through and tried the kitchen door and then john rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in his eyes
where was you hid to see all that
he cried
it seems to me that you knows a deal more than you should
holmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable
don't get arresting me for the murder he said
i am one of the hounds and not the wolf mr
gregson or mr
lestrade will answer for that
go on though
what did you do next
rance resumed his seat without however losing his mystified expression
i went back to the gate and sounded my whistle
that brought murcher and two more to the spot
was the street empty then
well it was as far as anybody that could be of any good goes
what do you mean
the constable's features broadened into a grin
i've seen many a drunk chap in my time he said but never anyone so cryin' drunk as that cove
he was at the gate when i came out a leanin' up agin the railings and a singin' at the pitch o' his lungs about columbine's new fangled banner or some such stuff
he couldn't stand far less help
what sort of a man was he
asked sherlock holmes
john rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression
he was an uncommon drunk sort o' man he said
he'd ha' found hisself in the station if we hadn't been so took up
his face his dress didn't you notice them
holmes broke in impatiently
i should think i did notice them seeing that i had to prop him up me and murcher between us
he was a long chap with a red face the lower part muffled round that will do cried holmes
what became of him
we'd enough to do without lookin' after him the policeman said in an aggrieved voice
i'll wager he found his way home all right
how was he dressed
a brown overcoat
had he a whip in his hand
a whip no
he must have left it behind muttered my companion
you didn't happen to see or hear a cab after that
no
there's a half sovereign for you my companion said standing up and taking his hat
i am afraid rance that you will never rise in the force
that head of yours should be for use as well as ornament
you might have gained your sergeant's stripes last night
the man whom you held in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery and whom we are seeking
there is no use of arguing about it now i tell you that it is so
come along doctor
we started off for the cab together leaving our informant incredulous but obviously uncomfortable
the blundering fool holmes said bitterly as we drove back to our lodgings
just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good luck and not taking advantage of it
i am rather in the dark still
it is true that the description of this man tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery
but why should he come back to the house after leaving it
that is not the way of criminals
the ring man the ring that was what he came back for
if we have no other way of catching him we can always bait our line with the ring
i shall have him doctor i'll lay you two to one that i have him
i must thank you for it all
i might not have gone but for you and so have missed the finest study i ever came across a study in scarlet eh
why shouldn't we use a little art jargon
there's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life and our duty is to unravel it and isolate it and expose every inch of it
and now for lunch and then for norman neruda
her attack and her bowing are splendid
what's that little thing of chopin's she plays so magnificently tra la la lira lira lay
leaning back in the cab this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a lark while i meditated upon the many sidedness of the human mind
our morning's exertions had been too much for my weak health and i was tired out in the afternoon
after holmes' departure for the concert i lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours' sleep
it was a useless attempt
my mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it
every time that i closed my eyes i saw before me the distorted baboon like countenance of the murdered man
so sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me that i found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its owner from the world
if ever human features bespoke vice of the most malignant type they were certainly those of enoch j drebber of cleveland
still i recognized that justice must be done and that the depravity of the victim was no condonment in the eyes of the law
the more i thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion's hypothesis that the man had been poisoned appear
i remembered how he had sniffed his lips and had no doubt that he had detected something which had given rise to the idea
then again if not poison what had caused the man's death since there was neither wound nor marks of strangulation
but on the other hand whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor
there were no signs of a struggle nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist
as long as all these questions were unsolved i felt that sleep would be no easy matter either for holmes or myself
his quiet self confident manner convinced me that he had already formed a theory which explained all the facts though what it was i could not for an instant conjecture
he was very late in returning so late that i knew that the concert could not have detained him all the time
dinner was on the table before he appeared
it was magnificent he said as he took his seat
do you remember what darwin says about music
he claims that the power of producing and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at
perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it
there are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood
that's rather a broad idea i remarked
one's ideas must be as broad as nature if they are to interpret nature he answered
what's the matter
you're not looking quite yourself
this brixton road affair has upset you
to tell the truth it has i said
i ought to be more case hardened after my afghan experiences
i saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at maiwand without losing my nerve
i can understand
there is a mystery about this which stimulates the imagination where there is no imagination there is no horror
have you seen the evening paper
no
it gives a fairly good account of the affair
it does not mention the fact that when the man was raised up a woman's wedding ring fell upon the floor
it is just as well it does not
why
look at this advertisement he answered
i had one sent to every paper this morning immediately after the affair
he threw the paper across to me and i glanced at the place indicated
it was the first announcement in the found column
in brixton road this morning it ran a plain gold wedding ring found in the roadway between the 'white hart' tavern and holland grove
apply dr
watson 221b baker street between eight and nine this evening
excuse my using your name he said
if i used my own some of these dunderheads would recognize it and want to meddle in the affair
that is all right i answered
but supposing anyone applies i have no ring
oh yes you have said he handing me one
this will do very well
it is almost a facsimile
and who do you expect will answer this advertisement
why the man in the brown coat our florid friend with the square toes
if he does not come himself he will send an accomplice
would he not consider it as too dangerous
not at all
if my view of the case is correct and i have every reason to believe that it is this man would rather risk anything than lose the ring
according to my notion he dropped it while stooping over drebber's body and did not miss it at the time
after leaving the house he discovered his loss and hurried back but found the police already in possession owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning
he had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have been aroused by his appearance at the gate
now put yourself in that man's place
on thinking the matter over it must have occurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leaving the house
what would he do then
he would eagerly look out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found
his eye of course would light upon this
he would be overjoyed
why should he fear a trap
there would be no reason in his eyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder
he would come
he will come
you shall see him within an hour
and then
i asked
oh you can leave me to deal with him then
have you any arms
i have my old service revolver and a few cartridges
you had better clean it and load it
he will be a desperate man and though i shall take him unawares it is as well to be ready for anything
i went to my bedroom and followed his advice
when i returned with the pistol the table had been cleared and holmes was engaged in his favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin
the plot thickens he said as i entered i have just had an answer to my american telegram
my view of the case is the correct one
and that is
i asked eagerly
my fiddle would be the better for new strings he remarked
put your pistol in your pocket
when the fellow comes speak to him in an ordinary way
leave the rest to me
don't frighten him by looking at him too hard
it is eight o'clock now i said glancing at my watch
yes
he will probably be here in a few minutes
open the door slightly
that will do
now put the key on the inside
thank you
this is a queer old book i picked up at a stall yesterday 'de jure inter gentes' published in latin at liege in the lowlands in
charles' head was still firm on his shoulders when this little brown backed volume was struck off
who is the printer
philippe de croy whoever he may have been
on the fly leaf in very faded ink is written 'ex libris guliolmi whyte '
i wonder who william whyte was
some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer i suppose
his writing has a legal twist about it
here comes our man i think
as he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell
sherlock holmes rose softly and moved his chair in the direction of the door
we heard the servant pass along the hall and the sharp click of the latch as she opened it
does dr
watson live here
asked a clear but rather harsh voice
we could not hear the servant's reply but the door closed and some one began to ascend the stairs
the footfall was an uncertain and shuffling one
a look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he listened to it
it came slowly along the passage and there was a feeble tap at the door
come in i cried
at my summons instead of the man of violence whom we expected a very old and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment
she appeared to be dazzled by the sudden blaze of light and after dropping a curtsey she stood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket with nervous shaky fingers
i glanced at my companion and his face had assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all i could do to keep my countenance
the old crone drew out an evening paper and pointed at our advertisement
it's this as has brought me good gentlemen she said dropping another curtsey a gold wedding ring in the brixton road
it belongs to my girl sally as was married only this time twelvemonth which her husband is steward aboard a union boat and what he'd say if he come 'ome and found her without her ring is more than i can think he being short enough at the best o' times but more especially when he has the drink
if it please you she went to the circus last night along with is that her ring
i asked
the lord be thanked
cried the old woman sally will be a glad woman this night
that's the ring
and what may your address be
i inquired taking up a pencil
duncan street houndsditch
a weary way from here
the brixton road does not lie between any circus and houndsditch said sherlock holmes sharply
the old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little red rimmed eyes
the gentleman asked me for _my_ address she said
sally lives in lodgings at mayfield place peckham
and your name is
my name is sawyer her's is dennis which tom dennis married her and a smart clean lad too as long as he's at sea and no steward in the company more thought of but when on shore what with the women and what with liquor shops here is your ring mrs
sawyer i interrupted in obedience to a sign from my companion it clearly belongs to your daughter and i am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner
with many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old crone packed it away in her pocket and shuffled off down the stairs
sherlock holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed into his room
he returned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster and a cravat
i'll follow her he said hurriedly she must be an accomplice and will lead me to him
wait up for me
the hall door had hardly slammed behind our visitor before holmes had descended the stair
looking through the window i could see her walking feebly along the other side while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind
either his whole theory is incorrect i thought to myself or else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery
there was no need for him to ask me to wait up for him for i felt that sleep was impossible until i heard the result of his adventure
it was close upon nine when he set out
i had no idea how long he might be but i sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages of henri murger's vie de boheme
ten o'clock passed and i heard the footsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed
eleven and the more stately tread of the landlady passed my door bound for the same destination
it was close upon twelve before i heard the sharp sound of his latch key
the instant he entered i saw by his face that he had not been successful
amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the mastery until the former suddenly carried the day and he burst into a hearty laugh
i wouldn't have the scotland yarders know it for the world he cried dropping into his chair i have chaffed them so much that they would never have let me hear the end of it
i can afford to laugh because i know that i will be even with them in the long run
what is it then
i asked
oh i don't mind telling a story against myself
that creature had gone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being foot sore
presently she came to a halt and hailed a four wheeler which was passing
i managed to be close to her so as to hear the address but i need not have been so anxious for she sang it out loud enough to be heard at the other side of the street 'drive to duncan street houndsditch ' she cried
this begins to look genuine i thought and having seen her safely inside i perched myself behind
that's an art which every detective should be an expert at
well away we rattled and never drew rein until we reached the street in question
i hopped off before we came to the door and strolled down the street in an easy lounging way
i saw the cab pull up
the driver jumped down and i saw him open the door and stand expectantly
nothing came out though
when i reached him he was groping about frantically in the empty cab and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever i listened to
there was no sign or trace of his passenger and i fear it will be some time before he gets his fare
on inquiring at number we found that the house belonged to a respectable paperhanger named keswick and that no one of the name either of sawyer or dennis had ever been heard of there
you don't mean to say i cried in amazement that that tottering feeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion without either you or the driver seeing her
old woman be damned
said sherlock holmes sharply
we were the old women to be so taken in
it must have been a young man and an active one too besides being an incomparable actor
the get up was inimitable
he saw that he was followed no doubt and used this means of giving me the slip
it shows that the man we are after is not as lonely as i imagined he was but has friends who are ready to risk something for him
now doctor you are looking done up
take my advice and turn in
i was certainly feeling very weary so i obeyed his injunction
i left holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire and long into the watches of the night i heard the low melancholy wailings of his violin and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem which he had set himself to unravel
the papers next day were full of the brixton mystery as they termed it
each had a long account of the affair and some had leaders upon it in addition
there was some information in them which was new to me
i still retain in my scrap book numerous clippings and extracts bearing upon the case
here is a condensation of a few of them the _daily telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had seldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features
the german name of the victim the absence of all other motive and the sinister inscription on the wall all pointed to its perpetration by political refugees and revolutionists
the socialists had many branches in america and the deceased had no doubt infringed their unwritten laws and been tracked down by them
after alluding airily to the vehmgericht aqua tofana carbonari the marchioness de brinvilliers the darwinian theory the principles of malthus and the ratcliff highway murders the article concluded by admonishing the government and advocating a closer watch over foreigners in england
the _standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort usually occurred under a liberal administration
they arose from the unsettling of the minds of the masses and the consequent weakening of all authority
the deceased was an american gentleman who had been residing for some weeks in the metropolis
he had stayed at the boarding house of madame charpentier in torquay terrace camberwell
he was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary mr
joseph stangerson
the two bade adieu to their landlady upon tuesday the 4th inst and departed to euston station with the avowed intention of catching the liverpool express
they were afterwards seen together upon the platform
nothing more is known of them until mr
drebber's body was as recorded discovered in an empty house in the brixton road many miles from euston
how he came there or how he met his fate are questions which are still involved in mystery
nothing is known of the whereabouts of stangerson
we are glad to learn that mr
lestrade and mr
gregson of scotland yard are both engaged upon the case and it is confidently anticipated that these well known officers will speedily throw light upon the matter
the _daily news_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being a political one
the despotism and hatred of liberalism which animated the continental governments had had the effect of driving to our shores a number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not soured by the recollection of all that they had undergone
among these men there was a stringent code of honour any infringement of which was punished by death
every effort should be made to find the secretary stangerson and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the deceased
a great step had been gained by the discovery of the address of the house at which he had boarded a result which was entirely due to the acuteness and energy of mr
gregson of scotland yard
sherlock holmes and i read these notices over together at breakfast and they appeared to afford him considerable amusement
i told you that whatever happened lestrade and gregson would be sure to score
that depends on how it turns out
oh bless you it doesn't matter in the least
if the man is caught it will be _on account_ of their exertions if he escapes it will be _in spite_ of their exertions
it's heads i win and tails you lose
whatever they do they will have followers
'un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui l'admire '
what on earth is this
i cried for at this moment there came the pattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs accompanied by audible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady
it's the baker street division of the detective police force said my companion gravely and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a dozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street arabs that ever i clapped eyes on
'tention
cried holmes in a sharp tone and the six dirty little scoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes
in future you shall send up wiggins alone to report and the rest of you must wait in the street
have you found it wiggins
no sir we hain't said one of the youths
i hardly expected you would
you must keep on until you do
here are your wages
he handed each of them a shilling
now off you go and come back with a better report next time
he waved his hand and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street
there's more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than out of a dozen of the force holmes remarked
the mere sight of an official looking person seals men's lips
these youngsters however go everywhere and hear everything
they are as sharp as needles too all they want is organisation
is it on this brixton case that you are employing them
i asked
yes there is a point which i wish to ascertain
it is merely a matter of time
hullo
we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance
here is gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every feature of his face
bound for us i know
yes he is stopping
there he is
there was a violent peal at the bell and in a few seconds the fair haired detective came up the stairs three steps at a time and burst into our sitting room
my dear fellow he cried wringing holmes' unresponsive hand congratulate me
i have made the whole thing as clear as day
a shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion's expressive face
do you mean that you are on the right track
he asked
the right track
why sir we have the man under lock and key
and his name is
arthur charpentier sub lieutenant in her majesty's navy cried gregson pompously rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest
sherlock holmes gave a sigh of relief and relaxed into a smile
take a seat and try one of these cigars he said
we are anxious to know how you managed it
will you have some whiskey and water
i don't mind if i do the detective answered
the tremendous exertions which i have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out
not so much bodily exertion you understand as the strain upon the mind
you will appreciate that mr
sherlock holmes for we are both brain workers
you do me too much honour said holmes gravely
let us hear how you arrived at this most gratifying result
the detective seated himself in the arm chair and puffed complacently at his cigar
then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of amusement
the fun of it is he cried that that fool lestrade who thinks himself so smart has gone off upon the wrong track altogether
he is after the secretary stangerson who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn
i have no doubt that he has caught him by this time
the idea tickled gregson so much that he laughed until he choked
and how did you get your clue
ah i'll tell you all about it
of course doctor watson this is strictly between ourselves
the first difficulty which we had to contend with was the finding of this american's antecedents
some people would have waited until their advertisements were answered or until parties came forward and volunteered information
that is not tobias gregson's way of going to work
you remember the hat beside the dead man
yes said holmes by john underwood and sons camberwell road
gregson looked quite crest fallen
i had no idea that you noticed that he said
have you been there
no
ha
cried gregson in a relieved voice you should never neglect a chance however small it may seem
to a great mind nothing is little remarked holmes sententiously
well i went to underwood and asked him if he had sold a hat of that size and description
he looked over his books and came on it at once
he had sent the hat to a mr
drebber residing at charpentier's boarding establishment torquay terrace
thus i got at his address
smart very smart
murmured sherlock holmes
i next called upon madame charpentier continued the detective
i found her very pale and distressed
her daughter was in the room too an uncommonly fine girl she is too she was looking red about the eyes and her lips trembled as i spoke to her
that didn't escape my notice
i began to smell a rat
you know the feeling mr
sherlock holmes when you come upon the right scent a kind of thrill in your nerves
'have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder mr
enoch j drebber of cleveland '
i asked
the mother nodded
she didn't seem able to get out a word
the daughter burst into tears
i felt more than ever that these people knew something of the matter
'at what o'clock did mr
drebber leave your house for the train '
i asked
'at eight o'clock ' she said gulping in her throat to keep down her agitation
'his secretary mr
stangerson said that there were two trains one at and one at
he was to catch the first
'and was that the last which you saw of him '
a terrible change came over the woman's face as i asked the question
her features turned perfectly livid
it was some seconds before she could get out the single word 'yes' and when it did come it was in a husky unnatural tone
there was silence for a moment and then the daughter spoke in a calm clear voice
'no good can ever come of falsehood mother ' she said
'let us be frank with this gentleman
we _did_ see mr
drebber again '
'god forgive you '
cried madame charpentier throwing up her hands and sinking back in her chair
'you have murdered your brother '
'arthur would rather that we spoke the truth ' the girl answered firmly
'you had best tell me all about it now ' i said
'half confidences are worse than none
besides you do not know how much we know of it '
'on your head be it alice '
cried her mother and then turning to me 'i will tell you all sir
do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this terrible affair
he is utterly innocent of it
my dread is however that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be compromised
that however is surely impossible
his high character his profession his antecedents would all forbid it '
'your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts ' i answered
'depend upon it if your son is innocent he will be none the worse '
'perhaps alice you had better leave us together ' she said and her daughter withdrew
'now sir ' she continued 'i had no intention of telling you all this but since my poor daughter has disclosed it i have no alternative
having once decided to speak i will tell you all without omitting any particular '
'it is your wisest course ' said i
'mr
drebber has been with us nearly three weeks
he and his secretary mr
stangerson had been travelling on the continent
i noticed a copenhagen label upon each of their trunks showing that that had been their last stopping place
stangerson was a quiet reserved man but his employer i am sorry to say was far otherwise
he was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways
the very night of his arrival he became very much the worse for drink and indeed after twelve o'clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober
his manners towards the maid servants were disgustingly free and familiar
worst of all he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my daughter alice and spoke to her more than once in a way which fortunately she is too innocent to understand
on one occasion he actually seized her in his arms and embraced her an outrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him for his unmanly conduct '
'but why did you stand all this ' i asked
'i suppose that you can get rid of your boarders when you wish '
mrs
charpentier blushed at my pertinent question
'would to god that i had given him notice on the very day that he came ' she said
'but it was a sore temptation
they were paying a pound a day each fourteen pounds a week and this is the slack season
i am a widow and my boy in the navy has cost me much
i grudged to lose the money
i acted for the best
this last was too much however and i gave him notice to leave on account of it
that was the reason of his going '
'well '
'my heart grew light when i saw him drive away
my son is on leave just now but i did not tell him anything of all this for his temper is violent and he is passionately fond of his sister
when i closed the door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind
alas in less than an hour there was a ring at the bell and i learned that mr
drebber had returned
he was much excited and evidently the worse for drink
he forced his way into the room where i was sitting with my daughter and made some incoherent remark about having missed his train
he then turned to alice and before my very face proposed to her that she should fly with him
you are of age he said and there is no law to stop you
i have money enough and to spare
never mind the old girl here but come along with me now straight away
you shall live like a princess
poor alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the door
i screamed and at that moment my son arthur came into the room
what happened then i do not know
i heard oaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle
i was too terrified to raise my head
when i did look up i saw arthur standing in the doorway laughing with a stick in his hand
i don't think that fine fellow will trouble us again he said
i will just go after him and see what he does with himself
with those words he took his hat and started off down the street
the next morning we heard of mr
drebber's mysterious death '
this statement came from mrs
charpentier's lips with many gasps and pauses
at times she spoke so low that i could hardly catch the words
i made shorthand notes of all that she said however so that there should be no possibility of a mistake
it's quite exciting said sherlock holmes with a yawn
what happened next
when mrs
charpentier paused the detective continued i saw that the whole case hung upon one point
fixing her with my eye in a way which i always found effective with women i asked her at what hour her son returned
'i do not know ' she answered
'not know '
'no he has a latch key and he let himself in '
'after you went to bed '
'yes '
'when did you go to bed '
'about eleven '
'so your son was gone at least two hours '
'yes '
'possibly four or five '
'yes '
'what was he doing during that time '
'i do not know ' she answered turning white to her very lips
of course after that there was nothing more to be done
i found out where lieutenant charpentier was took two officers with me and arrested him
when i touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come quietly with us he answered us as bold as brass 'i suppose you are arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel drebber ' he said
we had said nothing to him about it so that his alluding to it had a most suspicious aspect
very said holmes
he still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as having with him when he followed drebber
it was a stout oak cudgel
what is your theory then
well my theory is that he followed drebber as far as the brixton road
when there a fresh altercation arose between them in the course of which drebber received a blow from the stick in the pit of the stomach perhaps which killed him without leaving any mark
the night was so wet that no one was about so charpentier dragged the body of his victim into the empty house
as to the candle and the blood and the writing on the wall and the ring they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent
well done
said holmes in an encouraging voice
really gregson you are getting along
we shall make something of you yet
i flatter myself that i have managed it rather neatly the detective answered proudly
the young man volunteered a statement in which he said that after following drebber some time the latter perceived him and took a cab in order to get away from him
on his way home he met an old shipmate and took a long walk with him
on being asked where this old shipmate lived he was unable to give any satisfactory reply
i think the whole case fits together uncommonly well
what amuses me is to think of lestrade who had started off upon the wrong scent
i am afraid he won't make much of why by jove here's the very man himself
it was indeed lestrade who had ascended the stairs while we were talking and who now entered the room
the assurance and jauntiness which generally marked his demeanour and dress were however wanting
his face was disturbed and troubled while his clothes were disarranged and untidy
he had evidently come with the intention of consulting with sherlock holmes for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be embarrassed and put out
he stood in the centre of the room fumbling nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do
this is a most extraordinary case he said at last a most incomprehensible affair
ah you find it so mr
lestrade
cried gregson triumphantly
i thought you would come to that conclusion
have you managed to find the secretary mr
joseph stangerson
the secretary mr
joseph stangerson said lestrade gravely was murdered at halliday's private hotel about six o'clock this morning
the intelligence with which lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so unexpected that we were all three fairly dumfoundered
gregson sprang out of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water
i stared in silence at sherlock holmes whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn down over his eyes
stangerson too
he muttered
the plot thickens
it was quite thick enough before grumbled lestrade taking a chair
i seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war
are you are you sure of this piece of intelligence
stammered gregson
i have just come from his room said lestrade
i was the first to discover what had occurred
we have been hearing gregson's view of the matter holmes observed
would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done
i have no objection lestrade answered seating himself
i freely confess that i was of the opinion that stangerson was concerned in the death of drebber
this fresh development has shown me that i was completely mistaken
full of the one idea i set myself to find out what had become of the secretary
they had been seen together at euston station about half past eight on the evening of the third
at two in the morning drebber had been found in the brixton road
the question which confronted me was to find out how stangerson had been employed between and the time of the crime and what had become of him afterwards
i telegraphed to liverpool giving a description of the man and warning them to keep a watch upon the american boats
i then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging houses in the vicinity of euston
you see i argued that if drebber and his companion had become separated the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night and then to hang about the station again next morning
they would be likely to agree on some meeting place beforehand remarked holmes
so it proved
i spent the whole of yesterday evening in making enquiries entirely without avail
this morning i began very early and at eight o'clock i reached halliday's private hotel in little george street
on my enquiry as to whether a mr
stangerson was living there they at once answered me in the affirmative
'no doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting ' they said
'he has been waiting for a gentleman for two days '
'where is he now '
i asked
'he is upstairs in bed
he wished to be called at nine '
'i will go up and see him at once ' i said
it seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and lead him to say something unguarded
the boots volunteered to show me the room it was on the second floor and there was a small corridor leading up to it
the boots pointed out the door to me and was about to go downstairs again when i saw something that made me feel sickish in spite of my twenty years' experience
from under the door there curled a little red ribbon of blood which had meandered across the passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side
i gave a cry which brought the boots back
he nearly fainted when he saw it
the door was locked on the inside but we put our shoulders to it and knocked it in
the window of the room was open and beside the window all huddled up lay the body of a man in his nightdress
he was quite dead and had been for some time for his limbs were rigid and cold
when we turned him over the boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of joseph stangerson
the cause of death was a deep stab in the left side which must have penetrated the heart
and now comes the strangest part of the affair
what do you suppose was above the murdered man
i felt a creeping of the flesh and a presentiment of coming horror even before sherlock holmes answered
the word rache written in letters of blood he said
that was it said lestrade in an awe struck voice and we were all silent for a while
there was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes
my nerves which were steady enough on the field of battle tingled as i thought of it
the man was seen continued lestrade
a milk boy passing on his way to the dairy happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel
he noticed that a ladder which usually lay there was raised against one of the windows of the second floor which was wide open
after passing he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder
he came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel
he took no particular notice of him beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work
he has an impression that the man was tall had a reddish face and was dressed in a long brownish coat
he must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder for we found blood stained water in the basin where he had washed his hands and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife
i glanced at holmes on hearing the description of the murderer which tallied so exactly with his own
there was however no trace of exultation or satisfaction upon his face
did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer
he asked
nothing
stangerson had drebber's purse in his pocket but it seems that this was usual as he did all the paying
there was eighty odd pounds in it but nothing had been taken
whatever the motives of these extraordinary crimes robbery is certainly not one of them
there were no papers or memoranda in the murdered man's pocket except a single telegram dated from cleveland about a month ago and containing the words 'j
h is in europe '
there was no name appended to this message
and there was nothing else
holmes asked
nothing of any importance
the man's novel with which he had read himself to sleep was lying upon the bed and his pipe was on a chair beside him
there was a glass of water on the table and on the window sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills
sherlock holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight
the last link he cried exultantly
my case is complete
the two detectives stared at him in amazement
i have now in my hands my companion said confidently all the threads which have formed such a tangle
there are of course details to be filled in but i am as certain of all the main facts from the time that drebber parted from stangerson at the station up to the discovery of the body of the latter as if i had seen them with my own eyes
i will give you a proof of my knowledge
could you lay your hand upon those pills
i have them said lestrade producing a small white box i took them and the purse and the telegram intending to have them put in a place of safety at the police station
it was the merest chance my taking these pills for i am bound to say that i do not attach any importance to them
give them here said holmes
now doctor turning to me are those ordinary pills
they certainly were not
they were of a pearly grey colour small round and almost transparent against the light
from their lightness and transparency i should imagine that they are soluble in water i remarked
precisely so answered holmes
now would you mind going down and fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday
i went downstairs and carried the dog upstair in my arms
it's laboured breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end
indeed its snow white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual term of canine existence
i placed it upon a cushion on the rug
i will now cut one of these pills in two said holmes and drawing his penknife he suited the action to the word
one half we return into the box for future purposes
the other half i will place in this wine glass in which is a teaspoonful of water
you perceive that our friend the doctor is right and that it readily dissolves
this may be very interesting said lestrade in the injured tone of one who suspects that he is being laughed at i cannot see however what it has to do with the death of mr
joseph stangerson
patience my friend patience
you will find in time that it has everything to do with it
i shall now add a little milk to make the mixture palatable and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps it up readily enough
as he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and placed it in front of the terrier who speedily licked it dry
sherlock holmes' earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence watching the animal intently and expecting some startling effect
none such appeared however
the dog continued to lie stretched upon tho cushion breathing in a laboured way but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught
holmes had taken out his watch and as minute followed minute without result an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his features
he gnawed his lip drummed his fingers upon the table and showed every other symptom of acute impatience
so great was his emotion that i felt sincerely sorry for him while the two detectives smiled derisively by no means displeased at this check which he had met
it can't be a coincidence he cried at last springing from his chair and pacing wildly up and down the room it is impossible that it should be a mere coincidence
the very pills which i suspected in the case of drebber are actually found after the death of stangerson
and yet they are inert
what can it mean
surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot have been false
it is impossible
and yet this wretched dog is none the worse
ah i have it
i have it
with a perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box cut the other pill in two dissolved it added milk and presented it to the terrier
the unfortunate creature's tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning
sherlock holmes drew a long breath and wiped the perspiration from his forehead
i should have more faith he said i ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation
of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly poison and the other was entirely harmless
i ought to have known that before ever i saw the box at all
this last statement appeared to me to be so startling that i could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses
there was the dead dog however to prove that his conjecture had been correct
it seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away and i began to have a dim vague perception of the truth
all this seems strange to you continued holmes because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you
i had the good fortune to seize upon that and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition and indeed was the logical sequence of it
hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions
it is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery
the most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn
this murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those _outre_ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable
these strange details far from making the case more difficult have really had the effect of making it less so
mr
gregson who had listened to this address with considerable impatience could contain himself no longer
look here mr
sherlock holmes he said we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart man and that you have your own methods of working
we want something more than mere theory and preaching now though
it is a case of taking the man
i have made my case out and it seems i was wrong
young charpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair
lestrade went after his man stangerson and it appears that he was wrong too
you have thrown out hints here and hints there and seem to know more than we do but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the business
can you name the man who did it
i cannot help feeling that gregson is right sir remarked lestrade
we have both tried and we have both failed
you have remarked more than once since i have been in the room that you had all the evidence which you require
surely you will not withhold it any longer
any delay in arresting the assassin i observed might give him time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity
thus pressed by us all holmes showed signs of irresolution
he continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest and his brows drawn down as was his habit when lost in thought
there will be no more murders he said at last stopping abruptly and facing us
you can put that consideration out of the question
you have asked me if i know the name of the assassin
i do
the mere knowing of his name is a small thing however compared with the power of laying our hands upon him
this i expect very shortly to do
i have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements but it is a thing which needs delicate handling for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal with who is supported as i have had occasion to prove by another who is as clever as himself
as long as this man has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him but if he had the slightest suspicion he would change his name and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city
without meaning to hurt either of your feelings i am bound to say that i consider these men to be more than a match for the official force and that is why i have not asked your assistance
if i fail i shall of course incur all the blame due to this omission but that i am prepared for
at present i am ready to promise that the instant that i can communicate with you without endangering my own combinations i shall do so
gregson and lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance or by the depreciating allusion to the detective police
the former had flushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair while the other's beady eyes glistened with curiosity and resentment
neither of them had time to speak however before there was a tap at the door and the spokesman of the street arabs young wiggins introduced his insignificant and unsavoury person
please sir he said touching his forelock i have the cab downstairs
good boy said holmes blandly
why don't you introduce this pattern at scotland yard
he continued taking a pair of steel handcuffs from a drawer
see how beautifully the spring works
they fasten in an instant
the old pattern is good enough remarked lestrade if we can only find the man to put them on
very good very good said holmes smiling
the cabman may as well help me with my boxes
just ask him to step up wiggins
i was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about to set out on a journey since he had not said anything to me about it
there was a small portmanteau in the room and this he pulled out and began to strap
he was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the room
just give me a help with this buckle cabman he said kneeling over his task and never turning his head
the fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen defiant air and put down his hands to assist
at that instant there was a sharp click the jangling of metal and sherlock holmes sprang to his feet again
gentlemen he cried with flashing eyes let me introduce you to mr
jefferson hope the murderer of enoch drebber and of joseph stangerson
the whole thing occurred in a moment so quickly that i had no time to realize it
i have a vivid recollection of that instant of holmes' triumphant expression and the ring of his voice of the cabman's dazed savage face as he glared at the glittering handcuffs which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists
for a second or two we might have been a group of statues
then with an inarticulate roar of fury the prisoner wrenched himself free from holmes's grasp and hurled himself through the window
woodwork and glass gave way before him but before he got quite through gregson lestrade and holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds
he was dragged back into the room and then commenced a terrific conflict
so powerful and so fierce was he that the four of us were shaken off again and again
he appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit
his face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance
it was not until lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands
that done we rose to our feet breathless and panting
we have his cab said sherlock holmes
it will serve to take him to scotland yard
and now gentlemen he continued with a pleasant smile we have reached the end of our little mystery
you are very welcome to put any questions that you like to me now and there is no danger that i will refuse to answer them
in the central portion of the great north american continent there lies an arid and repulsive desert which for many a long year served as a barrier against the advance of civilisation
from the sierra nevada to nebraska and from the yellowstone river in the north to the colorado upon the south is a region of desolation and silence
nor is nature always in one mood throughout this grim district
it comprises snow capped and lofty mountains and dark and gloomy valleys
there are swift flowing rivers which dash through jagged canons and there are enormous plains which in winter are white with snow and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust
they all preserve however the common characteristics of barrenness inhospitality and misery
there are no inhabitants of this land of despair
a band of pawnees or of blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other hunting grounds but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight of those awesome plains and to find themselves once more upon their prairies
the coyote skulks among the scrub the buzzard flaps heavily through the air and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark ravines and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks
these are the sole dwellers in the wilderness
in the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the sierra blanco
as far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plain land all dusted over with patches of alkali and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes
on the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks with their rugged summits flecked with snow
in this great stretch of country there is no sign of life nor of anything appertaining to life
there is no bird in the steel blue heaven no movement upon the dull grey earth above all there is absolute silence
listen as one may there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness nothing but silence complete and heart subduing silence
it has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain
that is hardly true
looking down from the sierra blanco one sees a pathway traced out across the desert which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance
it is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers
here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali
approach and examine them
they are bones some large and coarse others smaller and more delicate
the former have belonged to oxen and the latter to men
for fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside
looking down on this very scene there stood upon the fourth of may eighteen hundred and forty seven a solitary traveller
his appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region
an observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty
his face was lean and haggard and the brown parchment like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones his long brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white his eyes were sunken in his head and burned with an unnatural lustre while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton
as he stood he leaned upon his weapon for support and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution
his gaunt face however and his clothes which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs proclaimed what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance
the man was dying dying from hunger and from thirst
he had toiled painfully down the ravine and on to this little elevation in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water
now the great salt plain stretched before his eyes and the distant belt of savage mountains without a sign anywhere of plant or tree which might indicate the presence of moisture
in all that broad landscape there was no gleam of hope
north and east and west he looked with wild questioning eyes and then he realised that his wanderings had come to an end and that there on that barren crag he was about to die
why not here as well as in a feather bed twenty years hence he muttered as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder
before sitting down he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl which he had carried slung over his right shoulder
it appeared to be somewhat too heavy for his strength for in lowering it it came down on the ground with some little violence
instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little moaning cry and from it there protruded a small scared face with very bright brown eyes and two little speckled dimpled fists
you've hurt me
said a childish voice reproachfully
have i though the man answered penitently i didn't go for to do it
as he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty little girl of about five years of age whose dainty shoes and smart pink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother's care
the child was pale and wan but her healthy arms and legs showed that she had suffered less than her companion
how is it now
he answered anxiously for she was still rubbing the towsy golden curls which covered the back of her head
kiss it and make it well she said with perfect gravity shoving the injured part up to him
that's what mother used to do
where's mother
mother's gone
i guess you'll see her before long
gone eh
said the little girl
funny she didn't say good bye she 'most always did if she was just goin' over to auntie's for tea and now she's been away three days
say it's awful dry ain't it
ain't there no water nor nothing to eat
no there ain't nothing dearie
you'll just need to be patient awhile and then you'll be all right
put your head up agin me like that and then you'll feel bullier
it ain't easy to talk when your lips is like leather but i guess i'd best let you know how the cards lie
what's that you've got
pretty things
fine things
cried the little girl enthusiastically holding up two glittering fragments of mica
when we goes back to home i'll give them to brother bob
you'll see prettier things than them soon said the man confidently
you just wait a bit
i was going to tell you though you remember when we left the river
oh yes
well we reckoned we'd strike another river soon d'ye see
but there was somethin' wrong compasses or map or somethin' and it didn't turn up
water ran out
just except a little drop for the likes of you and and and you couldn't wash yourself interrupted his companion gravely staring up at his grimy visage
no nor drink
and mr
bender he was the fust to go and then indian pete and then mrs
mcgregor and then johnny hones and then dearie your mother
then mother's a deader too cried the little girl dropping her face in her pinafore and sobbing bitterly
yes they all went except you and me
then i thought there was some chance of water in this direction so i heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped it together
it don't seem as though we've improved matters
there's an almighty small chance for us now
do you mean that we are going to die too
asked the child checking her sobs and raising her tear stained face
i guess that's about the size of it
why didn't you say so before
she said laughing gleefully
you gave me such a fright
why of course now as long as we die we'll be with mother again
yes you will dearie
and you too
i'll tell her how awful good you've been
i'll bet she meets us at the door of heaven with a big pitcher of water and a lot of buckwheat cakes hot and toasted on both sides like bob and me was fond of
how long will it be first
i don't know not very long
the man's eyes were fixed upon the northern horizon
in the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little specks which increased in size every moment so rapidly did they approach
they speedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds which circled over the heads of the two wanderers and then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them
they were buzzards the vultures of the west whose coming is the forerunner of death
cocks and hens cried the little girl gleefully pointing at their ill omened forms and clapping her hands to make them rise
say did god make this country
in course he did said her companion rather startled by this unexpected question
he made the country down in illinois and he made the missouri the little girl continued
i guess somebody else made the country in these parts
it's not nearly so well done
they forgot the water and the trees
what would ye think of offering up prayer
the man asked diffidently
it ain't night yet she answered
it don't matter
it ain't quite regular but he won't mind that you bet
you say over them ones that you used to say every night in the waggon when we was on the plains
why don't you say some yourself
the child asked with wondering eyes
i disremember them he answered
i hain't said none since i was half the height o' that gun
i guess it's never too late
you say them out and i'll stand by and come in on the choruses
then you'll need to kneel down and me too she said laying the shawl out for that purpose
you've got to put your hands up like this
it makes you feel kind o' good
it was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see it
side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers the little prattling child and the reckless hardened adventurer
her chubby face and his haggard angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom they were face to face while the two voices the one thin and clear the other deep and harsh united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness
the prayer finished they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep nestling upon the broad breast of her protector
he watched over her slumber for some time but nature proved to be too strong for him
for three days and three nights he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose
slowly the eyelids drooped over the tired eyes and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast until the man's grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber
had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight would have met his eyes
far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain there rose up a little spray of dust very slight at first and hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance but gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid well defined cloud
this cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures
in more fertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was approaching him
this was obviously impossible in these arid wilds
as the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing the canvas covered tilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze and the apparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for the west
but what a caravan
when the head of it had reached the base of the mountains the rear was not yet visible on the horizon
right across the enormous plain stretched the straggling array waggons and carts men on horseback and men on foot
innumerable women who staggered along under burdens and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white coverings
this was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants but rather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new country
there rose through the clear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this great mass of humanity with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses
loud as it was it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above them
at the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced men clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles
on reaching the base of the bluff they halted and held a short council among themselves
the wells are to the right my brothers said one a hard lipped clean shaven man with grizzly hair
to the right of the sierra blanco so we shall reach the rio grande said another
fear not for water cried a third
he who could draw it from the rocks will not now abandon his own chosen people
amen
amen
responded the whole party
they were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and keenest eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag above them
from its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink showing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind
at the sight there was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns while fresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard
the word 'redskins' was on every lip
there can't be any number of injuns here said the elderly man who appeared to be in command
we have passed the pawnees and there are no other tribes until we cross the great mountains
shall i go forward and see brother stangerson asked one of the band
and i and i cried a dozen voices
leave your horses below and we will await you here the elder answered
in a moment the young fellows had dismounted fastened their horses and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the object which had excited their curiosity
they advanced rapidly and noiselessly with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts
the watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock until their figures stood out against the skyline
the young man who had first given the alarm was leading them
suddenly his followers saw him throw up his hands as though overcome with astonishment and on joining him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met their eyes
on the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a single giant boulder and against this boulder there lay a tall man long bearded and hard featured but of an excessive thinness
his placid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep
beside him lay a little child with her round white arms encircling his brown sinewy neck and her golden haired head resting upon the breast of his velveteen tunic
her rosy lips were parted showing the regular line of snow white teeth within and a playful smile played over her infantile features
her plump little white legs terminating in white socks and neat shoes with shining buckles offered a strange contrast to the long shrivelled members of her companion
on the ledge of rock above this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards who at the sight of the new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped sullenly away
the cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about them in bewilderment
the man staggered to his feet and looked down upon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him and which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts
his face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed and he passed his boney hand over his eyes
this is what they call delirium i guess he muttered
the child stood beside him holding on to the skirt of his coat and said nothing but looked all round her with the wondering questioning gaze of childhood
the rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways that their appearance was no delusion
one of them seized the little girl and hoisted her upon his shoulder while two others supported her gaunt companion and assisted him towards the waggons
my name is john ferrier the wanderer explained me and that little un are all that's left o' twenty one people
the rest is all dead o' thirst and hunger away down in the south
is she your child
asked someone
i guess she is now the other cried defiantly she's mine 'cause i saved her
no man will take her from me
she's lucy ferrier from this day on
who are you though
he continued glancing with curiosity at his stalwart sunburned rescuers there seems to be a powerful lot of ye
nigh upon ten thousand said one of the young men we are the persecuted children of god the chosen of the angel merona
i never heard tell on him said the wanderer
he appears to have chosen a fair crowd of ye
do not jest at that which is sacred said the other sternly
we are of those who believe in those sacred writings drawn in egyptian letters on plates of beaten gold which were handed unto the holy joseph smith at palmyra
we have come from nauvoo in the state of illinois where we had founded our temple
we have come to seek a refuge from the violent man and from the godless even though it be the heart of the desert
the name of nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to john ferrier
i see he said you are the mormons
we are the mormons answered his companions with one voice
and where are you going
we do not know
the hand of god is leading us under the person of our prophet
you must come before him
he shall say what is to be done with you
they had reached the base of the hill by this time and were surrounded by crowds of the pilgrims pale faced meek looking women strong laughing children and anxious earnest eyed men
many were the cries of astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they perceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the other
their escort did not halt however but pushed on followed by a great crowd of mormons until they reached a waggon which was conspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of its appearance
six horses were yoked to it whereas the others were furnished with two or at most four a piece
beside the driver there sat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age but whose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader
he was reading a brown backed volume but as the crowd approached he laid it aside and listened attentively to an account of the episode
then he turned to the two castaways
if we take you with us he said in solemn words it can only be as believers in our own creed
we shall have no wolves in our fold
better far that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you should prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the whole fruit
will you come with us on these terms
guess i'll come with you on any terms said ferrier with such emphasis that the grave elders could not restrain a smile
the leader alone retained his stern impressive expression
take him brother stangerson he said give him food and drink and the child likewise
let it be your task also to teach him our holy creed
we have delayed long enough
forward
on on to zion
on on to zion
cried the crowd of mormons and the words rippled down the long caravan passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in a dull murmur in the far distance
with a cracking of whips and a creaking of wheels the great waggons got into motion and soon the whole caravan was winding along once more
the elder to whose care the two waifs had been committed led them to his waggon where a meal was already awaiting them
you shall remain here he said
in a few days you will have recovered from your fatigues
in the meantime remember that now and for ever you are of our religion
brigham young has said it and he has spoken with the voice of joseph smith which is the voice of god
this is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured by the immigrant mormons before they came to their final haven
from the shores of the mississippi to the western slopes of the rocky mountains they had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history
the savage man and the savage beast hunger thirst fatigue and disease every impediment which nature could place in the way had all been overcome with anglo saxon tenacity
yet the long journey and the accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them
there was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer when they saw the broad valley of utah bathed in the sunlight beneath them and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the promised land and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for evermore
young speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a resolute chief
maps were drawn and charts prepared in which the future city was sketched out
all around farms were apportioned and allotted in proportion to the standing of each individual
the tradesman was put to his trade and the artisan to his calling
in the town streets and squares sprang up as if by magic
in the country there was draining and hedging planting and clearing until the next summer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop
everything prospered in the strange settlement
above all the great temple which they had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger
from the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight the clatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which the immigrants erected to him who had led them safe through many dangers
the two castaways john ferrier and the little girl who had shared his fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter accompanied the mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage
little lucy ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough in elder stangerson's waggon a retreat which she shared with the mormon's three wives and with his son a headstrong forward boy of twelve
having rallied with the elasticity of childhood from the shock caused by her mother's death she soon became a pet with the women and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving canvas covered home
in the meantime ferrier having recovered from his privations distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter
so rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions that when they reached the end of their wanderings it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers with the exception of young himself and of stangerson kemball johnston and drebber who were the four principal elders
on the farm thus acquired john ferrier built himself a substantial log house which received so many additions in succeeding years that it grew into a roomy villa
he was a man of a practical turn of mind keen in his dealings and skilful with his hands
his iron constitution enabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his lands
hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him prospered exceedingly
in three years he was better off than his neighbours in six he was well to do in nine he was rich and in twelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of salt lake city who could compare with him
from the great inland sea to the distant wahsatch mountains there was no name better known than that of john ferrier
there was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities of his co religionists
no argument or persuasion could ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions
he never gave reasons for this persistent refusal but contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his determination
there were some who accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion and others who put it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense
others again spoke of some early love affair and of a fair haired girl who had pined away on the shores of the atlantic
whatever the reason ferrier remained strictly celibate
in every other respect he conformed to the religion of the young settlement and gained the name of being an orthodox and straight walking man
lucy ferrier grew up within the log house and assisted her adopted father in all his undertakings
the keen air of the mountains and the balsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to the young girl
as year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger her cheek more rudy and her step more elastic
many a wayfarer upon the high road which ran by ferrier's farm felt long forgotten thoughts revive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping through the wheatfields or met her mounted upon her father's mustang and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the west
so the bud blossomed into a flower and the year which saw her father the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of american girlhood as could be found in the whole pacific slope
it was not the father however who first discovered that the child had developed into the woman
it seldom is in such cases
that mysterious change is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates
least of all does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the touch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her and she learns with a mixture of pride and of fear that a new and a larger nature has awoken within her
there are few who cannot recall that day and remember the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life
in the case of lucy ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself apart from its future influence on her destiny and that of many besides
it was a warm june morning and the latter day saints were as busy as the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem
in the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry
down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily laden mules all heading to the west for the gold fever had broken out in california and the overland route lay through the city of the elect
there too were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands and trains of tired immigrants men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey
through all this motley assemblage threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider there galloped lucy ferrier her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her
she had a commission from her father in the city and was dashing in as she had done many a time before with all the fearlessness of youth thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed
the travel stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment and even the unemotional indians journeying in with their pelties relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale faced maiden
she had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road blocked by a great drove of cattle driven by a half dozen wild looking herdsmen from the plains
in her impatience she endeavoured to pass this obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap
scarcely had she got fairly into it however before the beasts closed in behind her and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of fierce eyed long horned bullocks
accustomed as she was to deal with cattle she was not alarmed at her situation but took advantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way through the cavalcade
unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures either by accident or design came in violent contact with the flank of the mustang and excited it to madness
in an instant it reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage and pranced and tossed in a way that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider
the situation was full of peril
every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns again and goaded it to fresh madness
it was all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle yet a slip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals
unaccustomed to sudden emergencies her head began to swim and her grip upon the bridle to relax
choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures she might have abandoned her efforts in despair but for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance
at the same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb and forcing a way through the drove soon brought her to the outskirts
you're not hurt i hope miss said her preserver respectfully
she looked up at his dark fierce face and laughed saucily
i'm awful frightened she said naively whoever would have thought that poncho would have been so scared by a lot of cows
thank god you kept your seat the other said earnestly
he was a tall savage looking young fellow mounted on a powerful roan horse and clad in the rough dress of a hunter with a long rifle slung over his shoulders
i guess you are the daughter of john ferrier he remarked i saw you ride down from his house
when you see him ask him if he remembers the jefferson hopes of st
louis
if he's the same ferrier my father and he were pretty thick
hadn't you better come and ask yourself
she asked demurely
the young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure
i'll do so he said we've been in the mountains for two months and are not over and above in visiting condition
he must take us as he finds us
he has a good deal to thank you for and so have i she answered he's awful fond of me
if those cows had jumped on me he'd have never got over it
neither would i said her companion
you
well i don't see that it would make much matter to you anyhow
you ain't even a friend of ours
the young hunter's dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that lucy ferrier laughed aloud
there i didn't mean that she said of course you are a friend now
you must come and see us
now i must push along or father won't trust me with his business any more
good bye
good bye he answered raising his broad sombrero and bending over her little hand
she wheeled her mustang round gave it a cut with her riding whip and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of dust
young jefferson hope rode on with his companions gloomy and taciturn
he and they had been among the nevada mountains prospecting for silver and were returning to salt lake city in the hope of raising capital enough to work some lodes which they had discovered
he had been as keen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawn his thoughts into another channel
the sight of the fair young girl as frank and wholesome as the sierra breezes had stirred his volcanic untamed heart to its very depths
when she had vanished from his sight he realized that a crisis had come in his life and that neither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of such importance to him as this new and all absorbing one
the love which had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden changeable fancy of a boy but rather the wild fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper
he had been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook
he swore in his heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human perseverance could render him successful
he called on john ferrier that night and many times again until his face was a familiar one at the farm house
john cooped up in the valley and absorbed in his work had had little chance of learning the news of the outside world during the last twelve years
all this jefferson hope was able to tell him and in a style which interested lucy as well as her father
he had been a pioneer in california and could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in those wild halcyon days
he had been a scout too and a trapper a silver explorer and a ranchman
wherever stirring adventures were to be had jefferson hope had been there in search of them
he soon became a favourite with the old farmer who spoke eloquently of his virtues
on such occasions lucy was silent but her blushing cheek and her bright happy eyes showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer her own
her honest father may not have observed these symptoms but they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her affections
it was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled up at the gate
she was at the doorway and came down to meet him
he threw the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway
i am off lucy he said taking her two hands in his and gazing tenderly down into her face i won't ask you to come with me now but will you be ready to come when i am here again
and when will that be
she asked blushing and laughing
a couple of months at the outside
i will come and claim you then my darling
there's no one who can stand between us
and how about father
she asked
he has given his consent provided we get these mines working all right
i have no fear on that head
oh well of course if you and father have arranged it all there's no more to be said she whispered with her cheek against his broad breast
thank god
he said hoarsely stooping and kissing her
it is settled then
the longer i stay the harder it will be to go
they are waiting for me at the canon
good bye my own darling good bye
in two months you shall see me
he tore himself from her as he spoke and flinging himself upon his horse galloped furiously away never even looking round as though afraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at what he was leaving
she stood at the gate gazing after him until he vanished from her sight
then she walked back into the house the happiest girl in all utah
three weeks had passed since jefferson hope and his comrades had departed from salt lake city
john ferrier's heart was sore within him when he thought of the young man's return and of the impending loss of his adopted child
yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to the arrangement more than any argument could have done
he had always determined deep down in his resolute heart that nothing would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a mormon
such a marriage he regarded as no marriage at all but as a shame and a disgrace
whatever he might think of the mormon doctrines upon that one point he was inflexible
he had to seal his mouth on the subject however for to express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in the land of the saints
yes a dangerous matter so dangerous that even the most saintly dared only whisper their religious opinions with bated breath lest something which fell from their lips might be misconstrued and bring down a swift retribution upon them
the victims of persecution had now turned persecutors on their own account and persecutors of the most terrible description
not the inquisition of seville nor the german vehm gericht nor the secret societies of italy were ever able to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over the state of utah
its invisibility and the mystery which was attached to it made this organization doubly terrible
it appeared to be omniscient and omnipotent and yet was neither seen nor heard
the man who held out against the church vanished away and none knew whither he had gone or what had befallen him
his wife and his children awaited him at home but no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the hands of his secret judges
a rash word or a hasty act was followed by annihilation and yet none knew what the nature might be of this terrible power which was suspended over them
no wonder that men went about in fear and trembling and that even in the heart of the wilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them
at first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the recalcitrants who having embraced the mormon faith wished afterwards to pervert or to abandon it
soon however it took a wider range
the supply of adult women was running short and polygamy without a female population on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed
strange rumours began to be bandied about rumours of murdered immigrants and rifled camps in regions where indians had never been seen
fresh women appeared in the harems of the elders women who pined and wept and bore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror
belated wanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men masked stealthy and noiseless who flitted by them in the darkness
these tales and rumours took substance and shape and were corroborated and re corroborated until they resolved themselves into a definite name
to this day in the lonely ranches of the west the name of the danite band or the avenging angels is a sinister and an ill omened one
fuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible results served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it inspired in the minds of men
none knew who belonged to this ruthless society
the names of the participators in the deeds of blood and violence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret
the very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the prophet and his mission might be one of those who would come forth at night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation
hence every man feared his neighbour and none spoke of the things which were nearest his heart
one fine morning john ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields when he heard the click of the latch and looking through the window saw a stout sandy haired middle aged man coming up the pathway
his heart leapt to his mouth for this was none other than the great brigham young himself
full of trepidation for he knew that such a visit boded him little good ferrier ran to the door to greet the mormon chief
the latter however received his salutations coldly and followed him with a stern face into the sitting room
brother ferrier he said taking a seat and eyeing the farmer keenly from under his light coloured eyelashes the true believers have been good friends to you
we picked you up when you were starving in the desert we shared our food with you led you safe to the chosen valley gave you a goodly share of land and allowed you to wax rich under our protection
is not this so
it is so answered john ferrier
in return for all this we asked but one condition that was that you should embrace the true faith and conform in every way to its usages
this you promised to do and this if common report says truly you have neglected
and how have i neglected it
asked ferrier throwing out his hands in expostulation
have i not given to the common fund
have i not attended at the temple
have i not
where are your wives
asked young looking round him
call them in that i may greet them
it is true that i have not married ferrier answered
but women were few and there were many who had better claims than i i was not a lonely man i had my daughter to attend to my wants
it is of that daughter that i would speak to you said the leader of the mormons
she has grown to be the flower of utah and has found favour in the eyes of many who are high in the land
john ferrier groaned internally
there are stories of her which i would fain disbelieve stories that she is sealed to some gentile
this must be the gossip of idle tongues
what is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted joseph smith
'let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect for if she wed a gentile she commits a grievous sin '
this being so it is impossible that you who profess the holy creed should suffer your daughter to violate it
john ferrier made no answer but he played nervously with his riding whip
upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested so it has been decided in the sacred council of four
the girl is young and we would not have her wed grey hairs neither would we deprive her of all choice
we elders have many heifers but our children must also be provided
stangerson has a son and drebber has a son and either of them would gladly welcome your daughter to their house
let her choose between them
they are young and rich and of the true faith
what say you to that
ferrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted
you will give us time he said at last
my daughter is very young she is scarce of an age to marry
she shall have a month to choose said young rising from his seat
at the end of that time she shall give her answer
he was passing through the door when he turned with flushed face and flashing eyes
it were better for you john ferrier he thundered that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the sierra blanco than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of the holy four
with a threatening gesture of his hand he turned from the door and ferrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path
he was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees considering how he should broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon his and looking up he saw her standing beside him
one glance at her pale frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed
i could not help it she said in answer to his look
his voice rang through the house
oh father father what shall we do
don't you scare yourself he answered drawing her to him and passing his broad rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair
we'll fix it up somehow or another
you don't find your fancy kind o' lessening for this chap do you
a sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer
no of course not
i shouldn't care to hear you say you did
he's a likely lad and he's a christian which is more than these folk here in spite o' all their praying and preaching
there's a party starting for nevada to morrow and i'll manage to send him a message letting him know the hole we are in
if i know anything o' that young man he'll be back here with a speed that would whip electro telegraphs
lucy laughed through her tears at her father's description
when he comes he will advise us for the best
but it is for you that i am frightened dear
one hears one hears such dreadful stories about those who oppose the prophet something terrible always happens to them
but we haven't opposed him yet her father answered
it will be time to look out for squalls when we do
we have a clear month before us at the end of that i guess we had best shin out of utah
leave utah
that's about the size of it
but the farm
we will raise as much as we can in money and let the rest go
to tell the truth lucy it isn't the first time i have thought of doing it
i don't care about knuckling under to any man as these folk do to their darned prophet
i'm a free born american and it's all new to me
guess i'm too old to learn
if he comes browsing about this farm he might chance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the opposite direction
but they won't let us leave his daughter objected
wait till jefferson comes and we'll soon manage that
in the meantime don't you fret yourself my dearie and don't get your eyes swelled up else he'll be walking into me when he sees you
there's nothing to be afeared about and there's no danger at all
john ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone but she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the fastening of the doors that night and that he carefully cleaned and loaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom
on the morning which followed his interview with the mormon prophet john ferrier went in to salt lake city and having found his acquaintance who was bound for the nevada mountains he entrusted him with his message to jefferson hope
in it he told the young man of the imminent danger which threatened them and how necessary it was that he should return
having done thus he felt easier in his mind and returned home with a lighter heart
as he approached his farm he was surprised to see a horse hitched to each of the posts of the gate
still more surprised was he on entering to find two young men in possession of his sitting room
one with a long pale face was leaning back in the rocking chair with his feet cocked up upon the stove
the other a bull necked youth with coarse bloated features was standing in front of the window with his hands in his pocket whistling a popular hymn
both of them nodded to ferrier as he entered and the one in the rocking chair commenced the conversation
maybe you don't know us he said
this here is the son of elder drebber and i'm joseph stangerson who travelled with you in the desert when the lord stretched out his hand and gathered you into the true fold
as he will all the nations in his own good time said the other in a nasal voice he grindeth slowly but exceeding small
john ferrier bowed coldly
he had guessed who his visitors were
we have come continued stangerson at the advice of our fathers to solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to you and to her
as i have but four wives and brother drebber here has seven it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one
nay nay brother stangerson cried the other the question is not how many wives we have but how many we can keep
my father has now given over his mills to me and i am the richer man
but my prospects are better said the other warmly
when the lord removes my father i shall have his tanning yard and his leather factory
then i am your elder and am higher in the church
it will be for the maiden to decide rejoined young drebber smirking at his own reflection in the glass
we will leave it all to her decision
during this dialogue john ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway hardly able to keep his riding whip from the backs of his two visitors
look here he said at last striding up to them when my daughter summons you you can come but until then i don't want to see your faces again
the two young mormons stared at him in amazement
in their eyes this competition between them for the maiden's hand was the highest of honours both to her and her father
there are two ways out of the room cried ferrier there is the door and there is the window
which do you care to use
his brown face looked so savage and his gaunt hands so threatening that his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat
the old farmer followed them to the door
let me know when you have settled which it is to be he said sardonically
you shall smart for this
stangerson cried white with rage
you have defied the prophet and the council of four
you shall rue it to the end of your days
the hand of the lord shall be heavy upon you cried young drebber he will arise and smite you
then i'll start the smiting exclaimed ferrier furiously and would have rushed upstairs for his gun had not lucy seized him by the arm and restrained him
before he could escape from her the clatter of horses' hoofs told him that they were beyond his reach
the young canting rascals
he exclaimed wiping the perspiration from his forehead i would sooner see you in your grave my girl than the wife of either of them
and so should i father she answered with spirit but jefferson will soon be here
yes
it will not be long before he comes
the sooner the better for we do not know what their next move may be
it was indeed high time that someone capable of giving advice and help should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted daughter
in the whole history of the settlement there had never been such a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the elders
if minor errors were punished so sternly what would be the fate of this arch rebel
ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no avail to him
others as well known and as rich as himself had been spirited away before now and their goods given over to the church
he was a brave man but he trembled at the vague shadowy terrors which hung over him
any known danger he could face with a firm lip but this suspense was unnerving
he concealed his fears from his daughter however and affected to make light of the whole matter though she with the keen eye of love saw plainly that he was ill at ease
he expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from young as to his conduct and he was not mistaken though it came in an unlooked for manner
upon rising next morning he found to his surprise a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over his chest
on it was printed in bold straggling letters twenty nine days are given you for amendment and then the dash was more fear inspiring than any threat could have been
how this warning came into his room puzzled john ferrier sorely for his servants slept in an outhouse and the doors and windows had all been secured
he crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter but the incident struck a chill into his heart
the twenty nine days were evidently the balance of the month which young had promised
what strength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such mysterious powers
the hand which fastened that pin might have struck him to the heart and he could never have known who had slain him
still more shaken was he next morning
they had sat down to their breakfast when lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards
in the centre of the ceiling was scrawled with a burned stick apparently the number
to his daughter it was unintelligible and he did not enlighten her
that night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and ward
he saw and he heard nothing and yet in the morning a great had been painted upon the outside of his door
thus day followed day and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen enemies had kept their register and had marked up in some conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the month of grace
sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls sometimes upon the floors occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or the railings
with all his vigilance john ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded
a horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of them
he became haggard and restless and his eyes had the troubled look of some hunted creature
he had but one hope in life now and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from nevada
twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten but there was no news of the absentee
one by one the numbers dwindled down and still there came no sign of him
whenever a horseman clattered down the road or a driver shouted at his team the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking that help had arrived at last
at last when he saw five give way to four and that again to three he lost heart and abandoned all hope of escape
single handed and with his limited knowledge of the mountains which surrounded the settlement he knew that he was powerless
the more frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded and none could pass along them without an order from the council
turn which way he would there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him
yet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter's dishonour
he was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles and searching vainly for some way out of them
that morning had shown the figure upon the wall of his house and the next day would be the last of the allotted time
what was to happen then
all manner of vague and terrible fancies filled his imagination
and his daughter what was to become of her after he was gone
was there no escape from the invisible network which was drawn all round them
he sank his head upon the table and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence
what was that
in the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound low but very distinct in the quiet of the night
it came from the door of the house
ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently
there was a pause for a few moments and then the low insidious sound was repeated
someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door
was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal
or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived
john ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart
springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door open
outside all was calm and quiet
the night was fine and the stars were twinkling brightly overhead
the little front garden lay before the farmer's eyes bounded by the fence and gate but neither there nor on the road was any human being to be seen
with a sigh of relief ferrier looked to right and to left until happening to glance straight down at his own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face upon the ground with arms and legs all asprawl
so unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with his hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out
his first thought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying man but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent
once within the house the man sprang to his feet closed the door and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of jefferson hope
good god
gasped john ferrier
how you scared me
whatever made you come in like that
give me food the other said hoarsely
i have had no time for bite or sup for eight and forty hours
he flung himself upon the cold meat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host's supper and devoured it voraciously
does lucy bear up well
he asked when he had satisfied his hunger
yes
she does not know the danger her father answered
that is well
the house is watched on every side
that is why i crawled my way up to it
they may be darned sharp but they're not quite sharp enough to catch a washoe hunter
john ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a devoted ally
he seized the young man's leathery hand and wrung it cordially
you're a man to be proud of he said
there are not many who would come to share our danger and our troubles
you've hit it there pard the young hunter answered
i have a respect for you but if you were alone in this business i'd think twice before i put my head into such a hornet's nest
it's lucy that brings me here and before harm comes on her i guess there will be one less o' the hope family in utah
what are we to do
to morrow is your last day and unless you act to night you are lost
i have a mule and two horses waiting in the eagle ravine
how much money have you
two thousand dollars in gold and five in notes
that will do
i have as much more to add to it
we must push for carson city through the mountains
you had best wake lucy
it is as well that the servants do not sleep in the house
while ferrier was absent preparing his daughter for the approaching journey jefferson hope packed all the eatables that he could find into a small parcel and filled a stoneware jar with water for he knew by experience that the mountain wells were few and far between
he had hardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his daughter all dressed and ready for a start
the greeting between the lovers was warm but brief for minutes were precious and there was much to be done
we must make our start at once said jefferson hope speaking in a low but resolute voice like one who realizes the greatness of the peril but has steeled his heart to meet it
the front and back entrances are watched but with caution we may get away through the side window and across the fields
once on the road we are only two miles from the ravine where the horses are waiting
by daybreak we should be half way through the mountains
what if we are stopped asked ferrier
hope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his tunic
if they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them with us he said with a sinister smile
the lights inside the house had all been extinguished and from the darkened window ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own and which he was now about to abandon for ever
he had long nerved himself to the sacrifice however and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes
all looked so peaceful and happy the rustling trees and the broad silent stretch of grain land that it was difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all
yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head
ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes jefferson hope had the scanty provisions and water while lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her more valued possessions
opening the window very slowly and carefully they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night and then one by one passed through into the little garden
with bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it and gained the shelter of the hedge which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfields
they had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the shadow where they lay silent and trembling
it was as well that his prairie training had given jefferson hope the ears of a lynx
he and his friends had hardly crouched down before the melancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of them which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small distance
at the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the gap for which they had been making and uttered the plaintive signal cry again on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity
to morrow at midnight said the first who appeared to be in authority
when the whip poor will calls three times
it is well returned the other
shall i tell brother drebber
pass it on to him and from him to the others
nine to seven
seven to five
repeated the other and the two figures flitted away in different directions
their concluding words had evidently been some form of sign and countersign
the instant that their footsteps had died away in the distance jefferson hope sprang to his feet and helping his companions through the gap led the way across the fields at the top of his speed supporting and half carrying the girl when her strength appeared to fail her
hurry on
hurry on
he gasped from time to time
we are through the line of sentinels
everything depends on speed
hurry on
once on the high road they made rapid progress
only once did they meet anyone and then they managed to slip into a field and so avoid recognition
before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a rugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains
two dark jagged peaks loomed above them through the darkness and the defile which led between them was the eagle canon in which the horses were awaiting them
with unerring instinct jefferson hope picked his way among the great boulders and along the bed of a dried up watercourse until he came to the retired corner screened with rocks where the faithful animals had been picketed
the girl was placed upon the mule and old ferrier upon one of the horses with his money bag while jefferson hope led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path
it was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face nature in her wildest moods
on the one side a great crag towered up a thousand feet or more black stern and menacing with long basaltic columns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster
on the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance impossible
between the two ran the irregular track so narrow in places that they had to travel in indian file and so rough that only practised riders could have traversed it at all
yet in spite of all dangers and difficulties the hearts of the fugitives were light within them for every step increased the distance between them and the terrible despotism from which they were flying
they soon had a proof however that they were still within the jurisdiction of the saints
they had reached the very wildest and most desolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry and pointed upwards
on a rock which overlooked the track showing out dark and plain against the sky there stood a solitary sentinel
he saw them as soon as they perceived him and his military challenge of who goes there
rang through the silent ravine
travellers for nevada said jefferson hope with his hand upon the rifle which hung by his saddle
they could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun and peering down at them as if dissatisfied at their reply
by whose permission
he asked
the holy four answered ferrier
his mormon experiences had taught him that that was the highest authority to which he could refer
nine from seven cried the sentinel
seven from five returned jefferson hope promptly remembering the countersign which he had heard in the garden
pass and the lord go with you said the voice from above
beyond his post the path broadened out and the horses were able to break into a trot
looking back they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon his gun and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen people and that freedom lay before them
all night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular and rock strewn paths
more than once they lost their way but hope's intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track once more
when morning broke a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them
in every direction the great snow capped peaks hemmed them in peeping over each other's shoulders to the far horizon
so steep were the rocky banks on either side of them that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them
nor was the fear entirely an illusion for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner
even as they passed a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges and startled the weary horses into a gallop
as the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon the caps of the great mountains lit up one after the other like lamps at a festival until they were all ruddy and glowing
the magnificent spectacle cheered the hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy
at a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their horses while they partook of a hasty breakfast
lucy and her father would fain have rested longer but jefferson hope was inexorable
they will be upon our track by this time he said
everything depends upon our speed
once safe in carson we may rest for the remainder of our lives
during the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their enemies
at night time they chose the base of a beetling crag where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind and there huddled together for warmth they enjoyed a few hours' sleep
before daybreak however they were up and on their way once more
they had seen no signs of any pursuers and jefferson hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they had incurred
he little knew how far that iron grasp could reach or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them
about the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of provisions began to run out
this gave the hunter little uneasiness however for there was game to be had among the mountains and he had frequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life
choosing a sheltered nook he piled together a few dried branches and made a blazing fire at which his companions might warm themselves for they were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level and the air was bitter and keen
having tethered the horses and bade lucy adieu he threw his gun over his shoulder and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way
looking back he saw the old man and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire while the three animals stood motionless in the back ground
then the intervening rocks hid them from his view
he walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without success though from the marks upon the bark of the trees and other indications he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity
at last after two or three hours' fruitless search he was thinking of turning back in despair when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart
on the edge of a jutting pinnacle three or four hundred feet above him there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance but armed with a pair of gigantic horns
the big horn for so it is called was acting probably as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction and had not perceived him
lying on his face he rested his rifle upon a rock and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger
the animal sprang into the air tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice and then came crashing down into the valley beneath
the creature was too unwieldy to lift so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank
with this trophy over his shoulder he hastened to retrace his steps for the evening was already drawing in
he had hardly started however before he realized the difficulty which faced him
in his eagerness he had wandered far past the ravines which were known to him and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken
the valley in which he found himself divided and sub divided into many gorges which were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other
he followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before
convinced that he had taken the wrong turn he tried another but with the same result
night was coming on rapidly and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him
even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track for the moon had not yet risen and the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound
weighed down with his burden and weary from his exertions he stumbled along keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to lucy and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey
he had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them
even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it
they must he reflected be awaiting him anxiously for he had been absent nearly five hours
in the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming
he paused and listened for an answer
none came save his own cry which clattered up the dreary silent ravines and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions
again he shouted even louder than before and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago
a vague nameless dread came over him and he hurried onwards frantically dropping the precious food in his agitation
when he turned the corner he came full in sight of the spot where the fire had been lit
there was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there but it had evidently not been tended since his departure
the same dead silence still reigned all round
with his fears all changed to convictions he hurried on
there was no living creature near the remains of the fire animals man maiden all were gone
it was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence a disaster which had embraced them all and yet had left no traces behind it
bewildered and stunned by this blow jefferson hope felt his head spin round and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling
he was essentially a man of action however and speedily recovered from his temporary impotence
seizing a half consumed piece of wood from the smouldering fire he blew it into a flame and proceeded with its help to examine the little camp
the ground was all stamped down by the feet of horses showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the fugitives and the direction of their tracks proved that they had afterwards turned back to salt lake city
had they carried back both of his companions with them
jefferson hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so when his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle within him
a little way on one side of the camp was a low lying heap of reddish soil which had assuredly not been there before
there was no mistaking it for anything but a newly dug grave
as the young hunter approached it he perceived that a stick had been planted on it with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it
the inscription upon the paper was brief but to the point john ferrier formerly of salt lake city died august 4th
the sturdy old man whom he had left so short a time before was gone then and this was all his epitaph
jefferson hope looked wildly round to see if there was a second grave but there was no sign of one
lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original destiny by becoming one of the harem of the elder's son
as the young fellow realized the certainty of her fate and his own powerlessness to prevent it he wished that he too was lying with the old farmer in his last silent resting place
again however his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs from despair
if there was nothing else left to him he could at least devote his life to revenge
with indomitable patience and perseverance jefferson hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness which he may have learned from the indians amongst whom he had lived
as he stood by the desolate fire he felt that the only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution brought by his own hand upon his enemies
his strong will and untiring energy should he determined be devoted to that one end
with a grim white face he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food and having stirred up the smouldering fire he cooked enough to last him for a few days
this he made up into a bundle and tired as he was he set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the avenging angels
for five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had already traversed on horseback
at night he flung himself down among the rocks and snatched a few hours of sleep but before daybreak he was always well on his way
on the sixth day he reached the eagle canon from which they had commenced their ill fated flight
thence he could look down upon the home of the saints
worn and exhausted he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him
as he looked at it he observed that there were flags in some of the principal streets and other signs of festivity
he was still speculating as to what this might mean when he heard the clatter of horse's hoofs and saw a mounted man riding towards him
as he approached he recognized him as a mormon named cowper to whom he had rendered services at different times
he therefore accosted him when he got up to him with the object of finding out what lucy ferrier's fate had been
i am jefferson hope he said
you remember me
the mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment indeed it was difficult to recognize in this tattered unkempt wanderer with ghastly white face and fierce wild eyes the spruce young hunter of former days
having however at last satisfied himself as to his identity the man's surprise changed to consternation
you are mad to come here he cried
it is as much as my own life is worth to be seen talking with you
there is a warrant against you from the holy four for assisting the ferriers away
i don't fear them or their warrant hope said earnestly
you must know something of this matter cowper
i conjure you by everything you hold dear to answer a few questions
we have always been friends
for god's sake don't refuse to answer me
what is it
the mormon asked uneasily
be quick
the very rocks have ears and the trees eyes
what has become of lucy ferrier
she was married yesterday to young drebber
hold up man hold up you have no life left in you
don't mind me said hope faintly
he was white to the very lips and had sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning
married you say
married yesterday that's what those flags are for on the endowment house
there was some words between young drebber and young stangerson as to which was to have her
they'd both been in the party that followed them and stangerson had shot her father which seemed to give him the best claim but when they argued it out in council drebber's party was the stronger so the prophet gave her over to him
no one won't have her very long though for i saw death in her face yesterday
she is more like a ghost than a woman
are you off then
yes i am off said jefferson hope who had risen from his seat
his face might have been chiselled out of marble so hard and set was its expression while its eyes glowed with a baleful light
where are you going
never mind he answered and slinging his weapon over his shoulder strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to the haunts of the wild beasts
amongst them all there was none so fierce and so dangerous as himself
the prediction of the mormon was only too well fulfilled
whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced poor lucy never held up her head again but pined away and died within a month
her sottish husband who had married her principally for the sake of john ferrier's property did not affect any great grief at his bereavement but his other wives mourned over her and sat up with her the night before the burial as is the mormon custom
they were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning when to their inexpressible fear and astonishment the door was flung open and a savage looking weather beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room
without a glance or a word to the cowering women he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of lucy ferrier
stooping over her he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead and then snatching up her hand he took the wedding ring from her finger
she shall not be buried in that he cried with a fierce snarl and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone
so strange and so brief was the episode that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared
for some months jefferson hope lingered among the mountains leading a strange wild life and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for vengeance which possessed him
tales were told in the city of the weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs and which haunted the lonely mountain gorges
once a bullet whistled through stangerson's window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him
on another occasion as drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder crashed down on him and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing himself upon his face
the two young mormons were not long in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives and led repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their enemy but always without success
then they adopted the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall and of having their houses guarded
after a time they were able to relax these measures for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness
far from doing so it had if anything augmented it
the hunter's mind was of a hard unyielding nature and the predominant idea of revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any other emotion
he was however above all things practical
he soon realized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it
exposure and want of wholesome food were wearing him out
if he died like a dog among the mountains what was to become of his revenge then
and yet such a death was sure to overtake him if he persisted
he felt that that was to play his enemy's game so he reluctantly returned to the old nevada mines there to recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation
his intention had been to be absent a year at the most but a combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines for nearly five
at the end of that time however his memory of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that memorable night when he had stood by john ferrier's grave
disguised and under an assumed name he returned to salt lake city careless what became of his own life as long as he obtained what he knew to be justice
there he found evil tidings awaiting him
there had been a schism among the chosen people a few months before some of the younger members of the church having rebelled against the authority of the elders and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the malcontents who had left utah and become gentiles
among these had been drebber and stangerson and no one knew whither they had gone
rumour reported that drebber had managed to convert a large part of his property into money and that he had departed a wealthy man while his companion stangerson was comparatively poor
there was no clue at all however as to their whereabouts
many a man however vindictive would have abandoned all thought of revenge in the face of such a difficulty but jefferson hope never faltered for a moment
with the small competence he possessed eked out by such employment as he could pick up he travelled from town to town through the united states in quest of his enemies
year passed into year his black hair turned grizzled but still he wandered on a human bloodhound with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he had devoted his life
at last his perseverance was rewarded
it was but a glance of a face in a window but that one glance told him that cleveland in ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of
he returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all arranged
it chanced however that drebber looking from his window had recognized the vagrant in the street and had read murder in his eyes
he hurried before a justice of the peace accompanied by stangerson who had become his private secretary and represented to him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of an old rival
that evening jefferson hope was taken into custody and not being able to find sureties was detained for some weeks
when at last he was liberated it was only to find that drebber's house was deserted and that he and his secretary had departed for europe
again the avenger had been foiled and again his concentrated hatred urged him to continue the pursuit
funds were wanting however and for some time he had to return to work saving every dollar for his approaching journey
at last having collected enough to keep life in him he departed for europe and tracked his enemies from city to city working his way in any menial capacity but never overtaking the fugitives
when he reached st
petersburg they had departed for paris and when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off for copenhagen
at the danish capital he was again a few days late for they had journeyed on to london where he at last succeeded in running them to earth
as to what occurred there we cannot do better than quote the old hunter's own account as duly recorded in dr
watson's journal to which we are already under such obligations
our prisoner's furious resistance did not apparently indicate any ferocity in his disposition towards ourselves for on finding himself powerless he smiled in an affable manner and expressed his hopes that he had not hurt any of us in the scuffle
i guess you're going to take me to the police station he remarked to sherlock holmes
my cab's at the door
if you'll loose my legs i'll walk down to it
i'm not so light to lift as i used to be
gregson and lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this proposition rather a bold one but holmes at once took the prisoner at his word and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ancles
he rose and stretched his legs as though to assure himself that they were free once more
i remember that i thought to myself as i eyed him that i had seldom seen a more powerfully built man and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was as formidable as his personal strength
if there's a vacant place for a chief of the police i reckon you are the man for it he said gazing with undisguised admiration at my fellow lodger
the way you kept on my trail was a caution
you had better come with me said holmes to the two detectives
i can drive you said lestrade
good
and gregson can come inside with me
you too doctor you have taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us
i assented gladly and we all descended together
our prisoner made no attempt at escape but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his and we followed him
lestrade mounted the box whipped up the horse and brought us in a very short time to our destination
we were ushered into a small chamber where a police inspector noted down our prisoner's name and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged
the official was a white faced unemotional man who went through his duties in a dull mechanical way
the prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the course of the week he said in the mean time mr
jefferson hope have you anything that you wish to say
i must warn you that your words will be taken down and may be used against you
i've got a good deal to say our prisoner said slowly
i want to tell you gentlemen all about it
hadn't you better reserve that for your trial
asked the inspector
i may never be tried he answered
you needn't look startled
it isn't suicide i am thinking of
are you a doctor
he turned his fierce dark eyes upon me as he asked this last question
yes i am i answered
then put your hand here he said with a smile motioning with his manacled wrists towards his chest
i did so and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and commotion which was going on inside
the walls of his chest seemed to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful engine was at work
in the silence of the room i could hear a dull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source
why i cried you have an aortic aneurism
that's what they call it he said placidly
i went to a doctor last week about it and he told me that it is bound to burst before many days passed
it has been getting worse for years
i got it from over exposure and under feeding among the salt lake mountains
i've done my work now and i don't care how soon i go but i should like to leave some account of the business behind me
i don't want to be remembered as a common cut throat
the inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the advisability of allowing him to tell his story
do you consider doctor that there is immediate danger
the former asked most certainly there is i answered
in that case it is clearly our duty in the interests of justice to take his statement said the inspector
you are at liberty sir to give your account which i again warn you will be taken down
i'll sit down with your leave the prisoner said suiting the action to the word
this aneurism of mine makes me easily tired and the tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters
i'm on the brink of the grave and i am not likely to lie to you
every word i say is the absolute truth and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to me
with these words jefferson hope leaned back in his chair and began the following remarkable statement
he spoke in a calm and methodical manner as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough
i can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account for i have had access to lestrade's note book in which the prisoner's words were taken down exactly as they were uttered
it don't much matter to you why i hated these men he said it's enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings a father and a daughter and that they had therefore forfeited their own lives
after the lapse of time that has passed since their crime it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court
i knew of their guilt though and i determined that i should be judge jury and executioner all rolled into one
you'd have done the same if you have any manhood in you if you had been in my place
that girl that i spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago
she was forced into marrying that same drebber and broke her heart over it
i took the marriage ring from her dead finger and i vowed that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring and that his last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished
i have carried it about with me and have followed him and his accomplice over two continents until i caught them
they thought to tire me out but they could not do it
if i die to morrow as is likely enough i die knowing that my work in this world is done and well done
they have perished and by my hand
there is nothing left for me to hope for or to desire
they were rich and i was poor so that it was no easy matter for me to follow them
when i got to london my pocket was about empty and i found that i must turn my hand to something for my living
driving and riding are as natural to me as walking so i applied at a cabowner's office and soon got employment
i was to bring a certain sum a week to the owner and whatever was over that i might keep for myself
there was seldom much over but i managed to scrape along somehow
the hardest job was to learn my way about for i reckon that of all the mazes that ever were contrived this city is the most confusing
i had a map beside me though and when once i had spotted the principal hotels and stations i got on pretty well
it was some time before i found out where my two gentlemen were living but i inquired and inquired until at last i dropped across them
they were at a boarding house at camberwell over on the other side of the river
when once i found them out i knew that i had them at my mercy
i had grown my beard and there was no chance of their recognizing me
i would dog them and follow them until i saw my opportunity
i was determined that they should not escape me again
they were very near doing it for all that
go where they would about london i was always at their heels
sometimes i followed them on my cab and sometimes on foot but the former was the best for then they could not get away from me
it was only early in the morning or late at night that i could earn anything so that i began to get behind hand with my employer
i did not mind that however as long as i could lay my hand upon the men i wanted
they were very cunning though
they must have thought that there was some chance of their being followed for they would never go out alone and never after nightfall
during two weeks i drove behind them every day and never once saw them separate
drebber himself was drunk half the time but stangerson was not to be caught napping
i watched them late and early but never saw the ghost of a chance but i was not discouraged for something told me that the hour had almost come
my only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon and leave my work undone
at last one evening i was driving up and down torquay terrace as the street was called in which they boarded when i saw a cab drive up to their door
presently some luggage was brought out and after a time drebber and stangerson followed it and drove off
i whipped up my horse and kept within sight of them feeling very ill at ease for i feared that they were going to shift their quarters
at euston station they got out and i left a boy to hold my horse and followed them on to the platform
i heard them ask for the liverpool train and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours
stangerson seemed to be put out at that but drebber was rather pleased than otherwise
i got so close to them in the bustle that i could hear every word that passed between them
drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him
his companion remonstrated with him and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together
drebber answered that the matter was a delicate one and that he must go alone
i could not catch what stangerson said to that but the other burst out swearing and reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant and that he must not presume to dictate to him
on that the secretary gave it up as a bad job and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at halliday's private hotel to which drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven and made his way out of the station
the moment for which i had waited so long had at last come
i had my enemies within my power
together they could protect each other but singly they were at my mercy
i did not act however with undue precipitation
my plans were already formed
there is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes him and why retribution has come upon him
i had my plans arranged by which i should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out
it chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the brixton road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage
it was claimed that same evening and returned but in the interval i had taken a moulding of it and had a duplicate constructed
by means of this i had access to at least one spot in this great city where i could rely upon being free from interruption
how to get drebber to that house was the difficult problem which i had now to solve
he walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops staying for nearly half an hour in the last of them
when he came out he staggered in his walk and was evidently pretty well on
there was a hansom just in front of me and he hailed it
i followed it so close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way
we rattled across waterloo bridge and through miles of streets until to my astonishment we found ourselves back in the terrace in which he had boarded
i could not imagine what his intention was in returning there but i went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from the house
he entered it and his hansom drove away
give me a glass of water if you please
my mouth gets dry with the talking
i handed him the glass and he drank it down
that's better he said
well i waited for a quarter of an hour or more when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the house
next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared one of whom was drebber and the other was a young chap whom i had never seen before
this fellow had drebber by the collar and when they came to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half across the road
'you hound ' he cried shaking his stick at him 'i'll teach you to insult an honest girl '
he was so hot that i think he would have thrashed drebber with his cudgel only that the cur staggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him
he ran as far as the corner and then seeing my cab he hailed me and jumped in
'drive me to halliday's private hotel ' said he
when i had him fairly inside my cab my heart jumped so with joy that i feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong
i drove along slowly weighing in my own mind what it was best to do
i might take him right out into the country and there in some deserted lane have my last interview with him
i had almost decided upon this when he solved the problem for me
the craze for drink had seized him again and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace
he went in leaving word that i should wait for him
there he remained until closing time and when he came out he was so far gone that i knew the game was in my own hands
don't imagine that i intended to kill him in cold blood
it would only have been rigid justice if i had done so but i could not bring myself to do it
i had long determined that he should have a show for his life if he chose to take advantage of it
among the many billets which i have filled in america during my wandering life i was once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at york college
one day the professor was lecturing on poisions and he showed his students some alkaloid as he called it which he had extracted from some south american arrow poison and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant death
i spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept and when they were all gone i helped myself to a little of it
i was a fairly good dispenser so i worked this alkaloid into small soluble pills and each pill i put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison
i determined at the time that when i had my chance my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes while i ate the pill that remained
it would be quite as deadly and a good deal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief
from that day i had always my pill boxes about with me and the time had now come when i was to use them
it was nearer one than twelve and a wild bleak night blowing hard and raining in torrents
dismal as it was outside i was glad within so glad that i could have shouted out from pure exultation
if any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing and longed for it during twenty long years and then suddenly found it within your reach you would understand my feelings
i lit a cigar and puffed at it to steady my nerves but my hands were trembling and my temples throbbing with excitement
as i drove i could see old john ferrier and sweet lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me just as plain as i see you all in this room
all the way they were ahead of me one on each side of the horse until i pulled up at the house in the brixton road
there was not a soul to be seen nor a sound to be heard except the dripping of the rain
when i looked in at the window i found drebber all huddled together in a drunken sleep
i shook him by the arm 'it's time to get out ' i said
'all right cabby ' said he
i suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned for he got out without another word and followed me down the garden
i had to walk beside him to keep him steady for he was still a little top heavy
when we came to the door i opened it and led him into the front room
i give you my word that all the way the father and the daughter were walking in front of us
'it's infernally dark ' said he stamping about
'we'll soon have a light ' i said striking a match and putting it to a wax candle which i had brought with me
'now enoch drebber ' i continued turning to him and holding the light to my own face 'who am i '
he gazed at me with bleared drunken eyes for a moment and then i saw a horror spring up in them and convulse his whole features which showed me that he knew me
he staggered back with a livid face and i saw the perspiration break out upon his brow while his teeth chattered in his head
at the sight i leaned my back against the door and laughed loud and long
i had always known that vengeance would be sweet but i had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me
'you dog '
i said 'i have hunted you from salt lake city to st
petersburg and you have always escaped me
now at last your wanderings have come to an end for either you or i shall never see to morrow's sun rise '
he shrunk still further away as i spoke and i could see on his face that he thought i was mad
so i was for the time
the pulses in my temples beat like sledge hammers and i believe i would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me
'what do you think of lucy ferrier now '
i cried locking the door and shaking the key in his face
'punishment has been slow in coming but it has overtaken you at last '
i saw his coward lips tremble as i spoke
he would have begged for his life but he knew well that it was useless
'would you murder me '
he stammered
'there is no murder ' i answered
'who talks of murdering a mad dog
what mercy had you upon my poor darling when you dragged her from her slaughtered father and bore her away to your accursed and shameless harem '
'it was not i who killed her father ' he cried
'but it was you who broke her innocent heart ' i shrieked thrusting the box before him
'let the high god judge between us
choose and eat
there is death in one and life in the other
i shall take what you leave
let us see if there is justice upon the earth or if we are ruled by chance '
he cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy but i drew my knife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me
then i swallowed the other and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or more waiting to see which was to live and which was to die
shall i ever forget the look which came over his face when the first warning pangs told him that the poison was in his system
i laughed as i saw it and held lucy's marriage ring in front of his eyes
it was but for a moment for the action of the alkaloid is rapid
a spasm of pain contorted his features he threw his hands out in front of him staggered and then with a hoarse cry fell heavily upon the floor
i turned him over with my foot and placed my hand upon his heart
there was no movement
he was dead
the blood had been streaming from my nose but i had taken no notice of it
i don't know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it
perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police upon a wrong track for i felt light hearted and cheerful
i remembered a german being found in new york with rache written up above him and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must have done it
i guessed that what puzzled the new yorkers would puzzle the londoners so i dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall
then i walked down to my cab and found that there was nobody about and that the night was still very wild
i had driven some distance when i put my hand into the pocket in which i usually kept lucy's ring and found that it was not there
i was thunderstruck at this for it was the only memento that i had of her
thinking that i might have dropped it when i stooped over drebber's body i drove back and leaving my cab in a side street i went boldly up to the house for i was ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring
when i arrived there i walked right into the arms of a police officer who was coming out and only managed to disarm his suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk
that was how enoch drebber came to his end
all i had to do then was to do as much for stangerson and so pay off john ferrier's debt
i knew that he was staying at halliday's private hotel and i hung about all day but he never came out
fancy that he suspected something when drebber failed to put in an appearance
he was cunning was stangerson and always on his guard
if he thought he could keep me off by staying indoors he was very much mistaken
i soon found out which was the window of his bedroom and early next morning i took advantage of some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel and so made my way into his room in the grey of the dawn
i woke him up and told him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he had taken so long before
i described drebber's death to him and i gave him the same choice of the poisoned pills
instead of grasping at the chance of safety which that offered him he sprang from his bed and flew at my throat
in self defence i stabbed him to the heart
it would have been the same in any case for providence would never have allowed his guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison
i have little more to say and it's as well for i am about done up
i went on cabbing it for a day or so intending to keep at it until i could save enough to take me back to america
i was standing in the yard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called jefferson hope and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221b baker street
i went round suspecting no harm and the next thing i knew this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists and as neatly snackled as ever i saw in my life
that's the whole of my story gentlemen
you may consider me to be a murderer but i hold that i am just as much an officer of justice as you are
so thrilling had the man's narrative been and his manner was so impressive that we had sat silent and absorbed
even the professional detectives _blase_ as they were in every detail of crime appeared to be keenly interested in the man's story
when he finished we sat for some minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching of lestrade's pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand account
there is only one point on which i should like a little more information sherlock holmes said at last
who was your accomplice who came for the ring which i advertised
the prisoner winked at my friend jocosely
i can tell my own secrets he said but i don't get other people into trouble
i saw your advertisement and i thought it might be a plant or it might be the ring which i wanted
my friend volunteered to go and see
i think you'll own he did it smartly
not a doubt of that said holmes heartily
now gentlemen the inspector remarked gravely the forms of the law must be complied with
on thursday the prisoner will be brought before the magistrates and your attendance will be required
until then i will be responsible for him
he rang the bell as he spoke and jefferson hope was led off by a couple of warders while my friend and i made our way out of the station and took a cab back to baker street
we had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the thursday but when the thursday came there was no occasion for our testimony
a higher judge had taken the matter in hand and jefferson hope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would be meted out to him
on the very night after his capture the aneurism burst and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the cell with a placid smile upon his face as though he had been able in his dying moments to look back upon a useful life and on work well done
gregson and lestrade will be wild about his death holmes remarked as we chatted it over next evening
where will their grand advertisement be now
i don't see that they had very much to do with his capture i answered
what you do in this world is a matter of no consequence returned my companion bitterly
the question is what can you make people believe that you have done
never mind he continued more brightly after a pause
i would not have missed the investigation for anything
there has been no better case within my recollection
simple as it was there were several most instructive points about it
simple
i ejaculated
well really it can hardly be described as otherwise said sherlock holmes smiling at my surprise
the proof of its intrinsic simplicity is that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions i was able to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days
that is true said i
i have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a guide rather than a hindrance
in solving a problem of this sort the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards
that is a very useful accomplishment and a very easy one but people do not practise it much
in the every day affairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards and so the other comes to be neglected
there are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically
i confess said i that i do not quite follow you
i hardly expected that you would
let me see if i can make it clearer
most people if you describe a train of events to them will tell you what the result would be
they can put those events together in their minds and argue from them that something will come to pass
there are few people however who if you told them a result would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result
this power is what i mean when i talk of reasoning backwards or analytically
i understand said i
now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find everything else for yourself
now let me endeavour to show you the different steps in my reasoning
to begin at the beginning
i approached the house as you know on foot and with my mind entirely free from all impressions
i naturally began by examining the roadway and there as i have already explained to you i saw clearly the marks of a cab which i ascertained by inquiry must have been there during the night
i satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels
the ordinary london growler is considerably less wide than a gentleman's brougham
this was the first point gained
i then walked slowly down the garden path which happened to be composed of a clay soil peculiarly suitable for taking impressions
no doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning
there is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps
happily i have always laid great stress upon it and much practice has made it second nature to me
i saw the heavy footmarks of the constables but i saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden
it was easy to tell that they had been before the others because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them
in this way my second link was formed which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number one remarkable for his height as i calculated from the length of his stride and the other fashionably dressed to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots
on entering the house this last inference was confirmed
my well booted man lay before me
the tall one then had done the murder if murder there was
there was no wound upon the dead man's person but the agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his fate before it came upon him
men who die from heart disease or any sudden natural cause never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their features
having sniffed the dead man's lips i detected a slightly sour smell and i came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon him
again i argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face
by the method of exclusion i had arrived at this result for no other hypothesis would meet the facts
do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea
the forcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals
the cases of dolsky in odessa and of leturier in montpellier will occur at once to any toxicologist
and now came the great question as to the reason why
robbery had not been the object of the murder for nothing was taken
was it politics then or was it a woman
that was the question which confronted me
i was inclined from the first to the latter supposition
political assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly
this murder had on the contrary been done most deliberately and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the room showing that he had been there all the time
it must have been a private wrong and not a political one which called for such a methodical revenge
when the inscription was discovered upon the wall i was more inclined than ever to my opinion
the thing was too evidently a blind
when the ring was found however it settled the question
clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of some dead or absent woman
it was at this point that i asked gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to cleveland as to any particular point in mr
drebber's former career
he answered you remember in the negative
i then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room which confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer's height and furnished me with the additional details as to the trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nails
i had already come to the conclusion since there were no signs of a struggle that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderer's nose in his excitement
i could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet
it is seldom that any man unless he is very full blooded breaks out in this way through emotion so i hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust and ruddy faced man
events proved that i had judged correctly
having left the house i proceeded to do what gregson had neglected
i telegraphed to the head of the police at cleveland limiting my enquiry to the circumstances connected with the marriage of enoch drebber
the answer was conclusive
it told me that drebber had already applied for the protection of the law against an old rival in love named jefferson hope and that this same hope was at present in europe
i knew now that i held the clue to the mystery in my hand and all that remained was to secure the murderer
i had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked into the house with drebber was none other than the man who had driven the cab
the marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in charge of it
where then could the driver be unless he were inside the house
again it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very eyes as it were of a third person who was sure to betray him
lastly supposing one man wished to dog another through london what better means could he adopt than to turn cabdriver
all these considerations led me to the irresistible conclusion that jefferson hope was to be found among the jarveys of the metropolis
if he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to be
on the contrary from his point of view any sudden change would be likely to draw attention to himself
he would probably for a time at least continue to perform his duties
there was no reason to suppose that he was going under an assumed name
why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one
i therefore organized my street arab detective corps and sent them systematically to every cab proprietor in london until they ferreted out the man that i wanted
how well they succeeded and how quickly i took advantage of it are still fresh in your recollection
the murder of stangerson was an incident which was entirely unexpected but which could hardly in any case have been prevented
through it as you know i came into possession of the pills the existence of which i had already surmised
you see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break or flaw
it is wonderful
i cried
your merits should be publicly recognized
you should publish an account of the case
if you won't i will for you
you may do what you like doctor he answered
see here
he continued handing a paper over to me look at this
it was the _echo_ for the day and the paragraph to which he pointed was devoted to the case in question
the public it said have lost a sensational treat through the sudden death of the man hope who was suspected of the murder of mr
enoch drebber and of mr
joseph stangerson
the details of the case will probably be never known now though we are informed upon good authority that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic feud in which love and mormonism bore a part
it seems that both the victims belonged in their younger days to the latter day saints and hope the deceased prisoner hails also from salt lake city
if the case has had no other effect it at least brings out in the most striking manner the efficiency of our detective police force and will serve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds at home and not to carry them on to british soil
it is an open secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to the well known scotland yard officials messrs
lestrade and gregson
the man was apprehended it appears in the rooms of a certain mr
sherlock holmes who has himself as an amateur shown some talent in the detective line and who with such instructors may hope in time to attain to some degree of their skill
it is expected that a testimonial of some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting recognition of their services
didn't i tell you so when we started
cried sherlock holmes with a laugh
that's the result of all our study in scarlet to get them a testimonial
never mind i answered i have all the facts in my journal and the public shall know them
in the meantime you must make yourself contented by the consciousness of success like the roman miser 'populus me sibilat at mihi plaudo ipse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca '
sherlock holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantel piece and his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case
with his long white nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle and rolled back his left shirt cuff
for some little time his eyes rested thoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dotted and scarred with innumerable puncture marks
finally he thrust the sharp point home pressed down the tiny piston and sank back into the velvet lined arm chair with a long sigh of satisfaction
three times a day for many months i had witnessed this performance but custom had not reconciled my mind to it
on the contrary from day to day i had become more irritable at the sight and my conscience swelled nightly within me at the thought that i had lacked the courage to protest
again and again i had registered a vow that i should deliver my soul upon the subject but there was that in the cool nonchalant air of my companion which made him the last man with whom one would care to take anything approaching to a liberty
his great powers his masterly manner and the experience which i had had of his many extraordinary qualities all made me diffident and backward in crossing him
yet upon that afternoon whether it was the beaune which i had taken with my lunch or the additional exasperation produced by the extreme deliberation of his manner i suddenly felt that i could hold out no longer
which is it to day
i asked morphine or cocaine
he raised his eyes languidly from the old black letter volume which he had opened
it is cocaine he said a seven per cent
solution
would you care to try it
no indeed i answered brusquely
my constitution has not got over the afghan campaign yet
i cannot afford to throw any extra strain upon it
he smiled at my vehemence
perhaps you are right watson he said
i suppose that its influence is physically a bad one
i find it however so transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mind that its secondary action is a matter of small moment
but consider
i said earnestly
count the cost
your brain may as you say be roused and excited but it is a pathological and morbid process which involves increased tissue change and may at last leave a permanent weakness
you know too what a black reaction comes upon you
surely the game is hardly worth the candle
why should you for a mere passing pleasure risk the loss of those great powers with which you have been endowed
remember that i speak not only as one comrade to another but as a medical man to one for whose constitution he is to some extent answerable
he did not seem offended
on the contrary he put his finger tips together and leaned his elbows on the arms of his chair like one who has a relish for conversation
my mind he said rebels at stagnation
give me problems give me work give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate analysis and i am in my own proper atmosphere
i can dispense then with artificial stimulants
but i abhor the dull routine of existence
i crave for mental exaltation
that is why i have chosen my own particular profession or rather created it for i am the only one in the world
the only unofficial detective
i said raising my eyebrows
the only unofficial consulting detective he answered
i am the last and highest court of appeal in detection
when gregson or lestrade or athelney jones are out of their depths which by the way is their normal state the matter is laid before me
i examine the data as an expert and pronounce a specialist's opinion
i claim no credit in such cases
my name figures in no newspaper
the work itself the pleasure of finding a field for my peculiar powers is my highest reward
but you have yourself had some experience of my methods of work in the jefferson hope case
yes indeed said i cordially
i was never so struck by anything in my life
i even embodied it in a small brochure with the somewhat fantastic title of 'a study in scarlet '
he shook his head sadly
i glanced over it said he
honestly i cannot congratulate you upon it
detection is or ought to be an exact science and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner
you have attempted to tinge it with romanticism which produces much the same effect as if you worked a love story or an elopement into the fifth proposition of euclid
but the romance was there i remonstrated
i could not tamper with the facts
some facts should be suppressed or at least a just sense of proportion should be observed in treating them
the only point in the case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from effects to causes by which i succeeded in unraveling it
i was annoyed at this criticism of a work which had been specially designed to please him
i confess too that i was irritated by the egotism which seemed to demand that every line of my pamphlet should be devoted to his own special doings
more than once during the years that i had lived with him in baker street i had observed that a small vanity underlay my companion's quiet and didactic manner
i made no remark however but sat nursing my wounded leg
i had a jezail bullet through it some time before and though it did not prevent me from walking it ached wearily at every change of the weather
my practice has extended recently to the continent said holmes after a while filling up his old brier root pipe
i was consulted last week by francois le villard who as you probably know has come rather to the front lately in the french detective service
he has all the celtic power of quick intuition but he is deficient in the wide range of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher developments of his art
the case was concerned with a will and possessed some features of interest
i was able to refer him to two parallel cases the one at riga in and the other at st
louis in which have suggested to him the true solution
here is the letter which i had this morning acknowledging my assistance
he tossed over as he spoke a crumpled sheet of foreign notepaper
i glanced my eyes down it catching a profusion of notes of admiration with stray magnifiques coup de maitres and tours de force all testifying to the ardent admiration of the frenchman
he speaks as a pupil to his master said i
oh he rates my assistance too highly said sherlock holmes lightly
he has considerable gifts himself
he possesses two out of the three qualities necessary for the ideal detective
he has the power of observation and that of deduction
he is only wanting in knowledge and that may come in time
he is now translating my small works into french
your works
oh didn't you know
he cried laughing
yes i have been guilty of several monographs
they are all upon technical subjects
here for example is one 'upon the distinction between the ashes of the various tobaccoes '
in it i enumerate a hundred and forty forms of cigar cigarette and pipe tobacco with colored plates illustrating the difference in the ash
it is a point which is continually turning up in criminal trials and which is sometimes of supreme importance as a clue
if you can say definitely for example that some murder has been done by a man who was smoking an indian lunkah it obviously narrows your field of search
to the trained eye there is as much difference between the black ash of a trichinopoly and the white fluff of bird's eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato
you have an extraordinary genius for minutiae i remarked
i appreciate their importance
here is my monograph upon the tracing of footsteps with some remarks upon the uses of plaster of paris as a preserver of impresses
here too is a curious little work upon the influence of a trade upon the form of the hand with lithotypes of the hands of slaters sailors corkcutters compositors weavers and diamond polishers
that is a matter of great practical interest to the scientific detective especially in cases of unclaimed bodies or in discovering the antecedents of criminals
but i weary you with my hobby
not at all i answered earnestly
it is of the greatest interest to me especially since i have had the opportunity of observing your practical application of it
but you spoke just now of observation and deduction
surely the one to some extent implies the other
why hardly he answered leaning back luxuriously in his arm chair and sending up thick blue wreaths from his pipe
for example observation shows me that you have been to the wigmore street post office this morning but deduction lets me know that when there you dispatched a telegram
right
said i
right on both points
but i confess that i don't see how you arrived at it
it was a sudden impulse upon my part and i have mentioned it to no one
it is simplicity itself he remarked chuckling at my surprise so absurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous and yet it may serve to define the limits of observation and of deduction
observation tells me that you have a little reddish mould adhering to your instep
just opposite the seymour street office they have taken up the pavement and thrown up some earth which lies in such a way that it is difficult to avoid treading in it in entering
the earth is of this peculiar reddish tint which is found as far as i know nowhere else in the neighborhood
so much is observation
the rest is deduction
how then did you deduce the telegram
why of course i knew that you had not written a letter since i sat opposite to you all morning
i see also in your open desk there that you have a sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of post cards
what could you go into the post office for then but to send a wire
eliminate all other factors and the one which remains must be the truth
in this case it certainly is so i replied after a little thought
the thing however is as you say of the simplest
would you think me impertinent if i were to put your theories to a more severe test
on the contrary he answered it would prevent me from taking a second dose of cocaine
i should be delighted to look into any problem which you might submit to me
i have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object in daily use without leaving the impress of his individuality upon it in such a way that a trained observer might read it
now i have here a watch which has recently come into my possession
would you have the kindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of the late owner
i handed him over the watch with some slight feeling of amusement in my heart for the test was as i thought an impossible one and i intended it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he occasionally assumed
he balanced the watch in his hand gazed hard at the dial opened the back and examined the works first with his naked eyes and then with a powerful convex lens
i could hardly keep from smiling at his crestfallen face when he finally snapped the case to and handed it back
there are hardly any data he remarked
the watch has been recently cleaned which robs me of my most suggestive facts
you are right i answered
it was cleaned before being sent to me
in my heart i accused my companion of putting forward a most lame and impotent excuse to cover his failure
what data could he expect from an uncleaned watch
though unsatisfactory my research has not been entirely barren he observed staring up at the ceiling with dreamy lack lustre eyes
subject to your correction i should judge that the watch belonged to your elder brother who inherited it from your father
that you gather no doubt from the h w upon the back
quite so
the w suggests your own name
the date of the watch is nearly fifty years back and the initials are as old as the watch so it was made for the last generation
jewelry usually descends to the eldest son and he is most likely to have the same name as the father
your father has if i remember right been dead many years
it has therefore been in the hands of your eldest brother
right so far said i
anything else
he was a man of untidy habits very untidy and careless
he was left with good prospects but he threw away his chances lived for some time in poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity and finally taking to drink he died
that is all i can gather
i sprang from my chair and limped impatiently about the room with considerable bitterness in my heart
this is unworthy of you holmes i said
i could not have believed that you would have descended to this
you have made inquires into the history of my unhappy brother and you now pretend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful way
you cannot expect me to believe that you have read all this from his old watch
it is unkind and to speak plainly has a touch of charlatanism in it
my dear doctor said he kindly pray accept my apologies
viewing the matter as an abstract problem i had forgotten how personal and painful a thing it might be to you
i assure you however that i never even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch
then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts
they are absolutely correct in every particular
ah that is good luck
i could only say what was the balance of probability
i did not at all expect to be so accurate
but it was not mere guess work
no no i never guess
it is a shocking habit destructive to the logical faculty
what seems strange to you is only so because you do not follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which large inferences may depend
for example i began by stating that your brother was careless
when you observe the lower part of that watch case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places but it is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard objects such as coins or keys in the same pocket
surely it is no great feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty guinea watch so cavalierly must be a careless man
neither is it a very far fetched inference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty well provided for in other respects
i nodded to show that i followed his reasoning
it is very customary for pawnbrokers in england when they take a watch to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin point upon the inside of the case
it is more handy than a label as there is no risk of the number being lost or transposed
there are no less than four such numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case
inference that your brother was often at low water
secondary inference that he had occasional bursts of prosperity or he could not have redeemed the pledge
finally i ask you to look at the inner plate which contains the key hole
look at the thousands of scratches all round the hole marks where the key has slipped
what sober man's key could have scored those grooves
but you will never see a drunkard's watch without them
he winds it at night and he leaves these traces of his unsteady hand
where is the mystery in all this
it is as clear as daylight i answered
i regret the injustice which i did you
i should have had more faith in your marvellous faculty
may i ask whether you have any professional inquiry on foot at present
none
hence the cocaine
i cannot live without brain work
what else is there to live for
stand at the window here
was ever such a dreary dismal unprofitable world
see how the yellow fog swirls down the street and drifts across the dun colored houses
what could be more hopelessly prosaic and material
what is the use of having powers doctor when one has no field upon which to exert them
crime is commonplace existence is commonplace and no qualities save those which are commonplace have any function upon earth
i had opened my mouth to reply to this tirade when with a crisp knock our landlady entered bearing a card upon the brass salver
a young lady for you sir she said addressing my companion
miss mary morstan he read
hum
i have no recollection of the name
ask the young lady to step up mrs
hudson
don't go doctor
i should prefer that you remain
miss morstan entered the room with a firm step and an outward composure of manner
she was a blonde young lady small dainty well gloved and dressed in the most perfect taste
there was however a plainness and simplicity about her costume which bore with it a suggestion of limited means
the dress was a sombre grayish beige untrimmed and unbraided and she wore a small turban of the same dull hue relieved only by a suspicion of white feather in the side
her face had neither regularity of feature nor beauty of complexion but her expression was sweet and amiable and her large blue eyes were singularly spiritual and sympathetic
in an experience of women which extends over many nations and three separate continents i have never looked upon a face which gave a clearer promise of a refined and sensitive nature
i could not but observe that as she took the seat which sherlock holmes placed for her her lip trembled her hand quivered and she showed every sign of intense inward agitation
i have come to you mr
holmes she said because you once enabled my employer mrs
cecil forrester to unravel a little domestic complication
she was much impressed by your kindness and skill
mrs
cecil forrester he repeated thoughtfully
i believe that i was of some slight service to her
the case however as i remember it was a very simple one
she did not think so
but at least you cannot say the same of mine
i can hardly imagine anything more strange more utterly inexplicable than the situation in which i find myself
holmes rubbed his hands and his eyes glistened
he leaned forward in his chair with an expression of extraordinary concentration upon his clear cut hawklike features
state your case said he in brisk business tones
i felt that my position was an embarrassing one
you will i am sure excuse me i said rising from my chair
to my surprise the young lady held up her gloved hand to detain me
if your friend she said would be good enough to stop he might be of inestimable service to me
i relapsed into my chair
briefly she continued the facts are these
my father was an officer in an indian regiment who sent me home when i was quite a child
my mother was dead and i had no relative in england
i was placed however in a comfortable boarding establishment at edinburgh and there i remained until i was seventeen years of age
in the year my father who was senior captain of his regiment obtained twelve months' leave and came home
he telegraphed to me from london that he had arrived all safe and directed me to come down at once giving the langham hotel as his address
his message as i remember was full of kindness and love
on reaching london i drove to the langham and was informed that captain morstan was staying there but that he had gone out the night before and had not yet returned
i waited all day without news of him
that night on the advice of the manager of the hotel i communicated with the police and next morning we advertised in all the papers
our inquiries led to no result and from that day to this no word has ever been heard of my unfortunate father
he came home with his heart full of hope to find some peace some comfort and instead she put her hand to her throat and a choking sob cut short the sentence
the date
asked holmes opening his note book
he disappeared upon the 3d of december nearly ten years ago
his luggage
remained at the hotel
there was nothing in it to suggest a clue some clothes some books and a considerable number of curiosities from the andaman islands
he had been one of the officers in charge of the convict guard there
had he any friends in town
only one that we know of major sholto of his own regiment the 34th bombay infantry
the major had retired some little time before and lived at upper norwood
we communicated with him of course but he did not even know that his brother officer was in england
a singular case remarked holmes
i have not yet described to you the most singular part
about six years ago to be exact upon the 4th of may an advertisement appeared in the times asking for the address of miss mary morstan and stating that it would be to her advantage to come forward
there was no name or address appended
i had at that time just entered the family of mrs
cecil forrester in the capacity of governess
by her advice i published my address in the advertisement column
the same day there arrived through the post a small card board box addressed to me which i found to contain a very large and lustrous pearl
no word of writing was enclosed
since then every year upon the same date there has always appeared a similar box containing a similar pearl without any clue as to the sender
they have been pronounced by an expert to be of a rare variety and of considerable value
you can see for yourselves that they are very handsome
she opened a flat box as she spoke and showed me six of the finest pearls that i had ever seen
your statement is most interesting said sherlock holmes
has anything else occurred to you
yes and no later than to day
that is why i have come to you
this morning i received this letter which you will perhaps read for yourself
thank you said holmes
the envelope too please
postmark london s w
date july
hum
man's thumb mark on corner probably postman
best quality paper
envelopes at sixpence a packet
particular man in his stationery
no address
'be at the third pillar from the left outside the lyceum theatre to night at seven o'clock
if you are distrustful bring two friends
you are a wronged woman and shall have justice
do not bring police
if you do all will be in vain
your unknown friend '
well really this is a very pretty little mystery
what do you intend to do miss morstan
that is exactly what i want to ask you
then we shall most certainly go
you and i and yes why dr
watson is the very man
your correspondent says two friends
he and i have worked together before
but would he come
she asked with something appealing in her voice and expression
i should be proud and happy said i fervently if i can be of any service
you are both very kind she answered
i have led a retired life and have no friends whom i could appeal to
if i am here at six it will do i suppose
you must not be later said holmes
there is one other point however
is this handwriting the same as that upon the pearl box addresses
i have them here she answered producing half a dozen pieces of paper
you are certainly a model client
you have the correct intuition
let us see now
he spread out the papers upon the table and gave little darting glances from one to the other
they are disguised hands except the letter he said presently but there can be no question as to the authorship
see how the irrepressible greek e will break out and see the twirl of the final s they are undoubtedly by the same person
i should not like to suggest false hopes miss morstan but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of your father
nothing could be more unlike
i expected to hear you say so
we shall look out for you then at six
pray allow me to keep the papers
i may look into the matter before then
it is only half past three
au revoir then
au revoir said our visitor and with a bright kindly glance from one to the other of us she replaced her pearl box in her bosom and hurried away
standing at the window i watched her walking briskly down the street until the gray turban and white feather were but a speck in the sombre crowd
what a very attractive woman
i exclaimed turning to my companion
he had lit his pipe again and was leaning back with drooping eyelids
is she
he said languidly
i did not observe
you really are an automaton a calculating machine
i cried
there is something positively inhuman in you at times
he smiled gently
it is of the first importance he said not to allow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities
a client is to me a mere unit a factor in a problem
the emotional qualities are antagonistic to clear reasoning
i assure you that the most winning woman i ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children for their insurance money and the most repellant man of my acquaintance is a philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a million upon the london poor
in this case however i never make exceptions
an exception disproves the rule
have you ever had occasion to study character in handwriting
what do you make of this fellow's scribble
it is legible and regular i answered
a man of business habits and some force of character
holmes shook his head
look at his long letters he said
they hardly rise above the common herd
that d might be an a and that l an e men of character always differentiate their long letters however illegibly they may write
there is vacillation in his k's and self esteem in his capitals
i am going out now
i have some few references to make
let me recommend this book one of the most remarkable ever penned
it is winwood reade's 'martyrdom of man '
i shall be back in an hour
i sat in the window with the volume in my hand but my thoughts were far from the daring speculations of the writer
my mind ran upon our late visitor her smiles the deep rich tones of her voice the strange mystery which overhung her life
if she were seventeen at the time of her father's disappearance she must be seven and twenty now a sweet age when youth has lost its self consciousness and become a little sobered by experience
so i sat and mused until such dangerous thoughts came into my head that i hurried away to my desk and plunged furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology
what was i an army surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker banking account that i should dare to think of such things
she was a unit a factor nothing more
if my future were black it was better surely to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will o' the wisps of the imagination
it was half past five before holmes returned
he was bright eager and in excellent spirits a mood which in his case alternated with fits of the blackest depression
there is no great mystery in this matter he said taking the cup of tea which i had poured out for him
the facts appear to admit of only one explanation
what
you have solved it already
well that would be too much to say
i have discovered a suggestive fact that is all
it is however very suggestive
the details are still to be added
i have just found on consulting the back files of the times that major sholto of upper norword late of the 34th bombay infantry died upon the 28th of april
i may be very obtuse holmes but i fail to see what this suggests
no
you surprise me
look at it in this way then
captain morstan disappears
the only person in london whom he could have visited is major sholto
major sholto denies having heard that he was in london
four years later sholto dies
within a week of his death captain morstan's daughter receives a valuable present which is repeated from year to year and now culminates in a letter which describes her as a wronged woman
what wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her father
and why should the presents begin immediately after sholto's death unless it is that sholto's heir knows something of the mystery and desires to make compensation
have you any alternative theory which will meet the facts
but what a strange compensation
and how strangely made
why too should he write a letter now rather than six years ago
again the letter speaks of giving her justice
what justice can she have
it is too much to suppose that her father is still alive
there is no other injustice in her case that you know of
there are difficulties there are certainly difficulties said sherlock holmes pensively
but our expedition of to night will solve them all
ah here is a four wheeler and miss morstan is inside
are you all ready
then we had better go down for it is a little past the hour
i picked up my hat and my heaviest stick but i observed that holmes took his revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket
it was clear that he thought that our night's work might be a serious one
miss morstan was muffled in a dark cloak and her sensitive face was composed but pale
she must have been more than woman if she did not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we were embarking yet her self control was perfect and she readily answered the few additional questions which sherlock holmes put to her
major sholto was a very particular friend of papa's she said
his letters were full of allusions to the major
he and papa were in command of the troops at the andaman islands so they were thrown a great deal together
by the way a curious paper was found in papa's desk which no one could understand
i don't suppose that it is of the slightest importance but i thought you might care to see it so i brought it with me
it is here
holmes unfolded the paper carefully and smoothed it out upon his knee
he then very methodically examined it all over with his double lens
it is paper of native indian manufacture he remarked
it has at some time been pinned to a board
the diagram upon it appears to be a plan of part of a large building with numerous halls corridors and passages
at one point is a small cross done in red ink and above it is ' from left ' in faded pencil writing
in the left hand corner is a curious hieroglyphic like four crosses in a line with their arms touching
beside it is written in very rough and coarse characters 'the sign of the four jonathan small mahomet singh abdullah khan dost akbar '
no i confess that i do not see how this bears upon the matter
yet it is evidently a document of importance
it has been kept carefully in a pocket book for the one side is as clean as the other
it was in his pocket book that we found it
preserve it carefully then miss morstan for it may prove to be of use to us
i begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much deeper and more subtle than i at first supposed
i must reconsider my ideas
he leaned back in the cab and i could see by his drawn brow and his vacant eye that he was thinking intently
miss morstan and i chatted in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible outcome but our companion maintained his impenetrable reserve until the end of our journey
it was a september evening and not yet seven o'clock but the day had been a dreary one and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city
mud colored clouds drooped sadly over the muddy streets
down the strand the lamps were but misty splotches of diffused light which threw a feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement
the yellow glare from the shop windows streamed out into the steamy vaporous air and threw a murky shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare
there was to my mind something eerie and ghost like in the endless procession of faces which flitted across these narrow bars of light sad faces and glad haggard and merry
like all human kind they flitted from the gloom into the light and so back into the gloom once more
i am not subject to impressions but the dull heavy evening with the strange business upon which we were engaged combined to make me nervous and depressed
i could see from miss morstan's manner that she was suffering from the same feeling
holmes alone could rise superior to petty influences
he held his open note book upon his knee and from time to time he jotted down figures and memoranda in the light of his pocket lantern
at the lyceum theatre the crowds were already thick at the side entrances
in front a continuous stream of hansoms and four wheelers were rattling up discharging their cargoes of shirt fronted men and beshawled bediamonded women
we had hardly reached the third pillar which was our rendezvous before a small dark brisk man in the dress of a coachman accosted us
are you the parties who come with miss morstan
he asked
i am miss morstan and these two gentlemen are my friends said she
he bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and questioning eyes upon us
you will excuse me miss he said with a certain dogged manner but i was to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companions is a police officer
i give you my word on that she answered
he gave a shrill whistle on which a street arab led across a four wheeler and opened the door
the man who had addressed us mounted to the box while we took our places inside
we had hardly done so before the driver whipped up his horse and we plunged away at a furious pace through the foggy streets
the situation was a curious one
we were driving to an unknown place on an unknown errand
yet our invitation was either a complete hoax which was an inconceivable hypothesis or else we had good reason to think that important issues might hang upon our journey
miss morstan's demeanor was as resolute and collected as ever
i endeavored to cheer and amuse her by reminiscences of my adventures in afghanistan but to tell the truth i was myself so excited at our situation and so curious as to our destination that my stories were slightly involved
to this day she declares that i told her one moving anecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead of night and how i fired a double barrelled tiger cub at it
at first i had some idea as to the direction in which we were driving but soon what with our pace the fog and my own limited knowledge of london i lost my bearings and knew nothing save that we seemed to be going a very long way
sherlock holmes was never at fault however and he muttered the names as the cab rattled through squares and in and out by tortuous by streets
rochester row said he
now vincent square
now we come out on the vauxhall bridge road
we are making for the surrey side apparently
yes i thought so
now we are on the bridge
you can catch glimpses of the river
we did indeed get a fleeting view of a stretch of the thames with the lamps shining upon the broad silent water but our cab dashed on and was soon involved in a labyrinth of streets upon the other side
wordsworth road said my companion
priory road
lark hall lane
stockwell place
robert street
cold harbor lane
our quest does not appear to take us to very fashionable regions
we had indeed reached a questionable and forbidding neighborhood
long lines of dull brick houses were only relieved by the coarse glare and tawdry brilliancy of public houses at the corner
then came rows of two storied villas each with a fronting of miniature garden and then again interminable lines of new staring brick buildings the monster tentacles which the giant city was throwing out into the country
at last the cab drew up at the third house in a new terrace
none of the other houses were inhabited and that at which we stopped was as dark as its neighbors save for a single glimmer in the kitchen window
on our knocking however the door was instantly thrown open by a hindoo servant clad in a yellow turban white loose fitting clothes and a yellow sash
there was something strangely incongruous in this oriental figure framed in the commonplace door way of a third rate suburban dwelling house
the sahib awaits you said he and even as he spoke there came a high piping voice from some inner room
show them in to me khitmutgar it cried
show them straight in to me
we followed the indian down a sordid and common passage ill lit and worse furnished until he came to a door upon the right which he threw open
a blaze of yellow light streamed out upon us and in the centre of the glare there stood a small man with a very high head a bristle of red hair all round the fringe of it and a bald shining scalp which shot out from among it like a mountain peak from fir trees
he writhed his hands together as he stood and his features were in a perpetual jerk now smiling now scowling but never for an instant in repose
nature had given him a pendulous lip and a too visible line of yellow and irregular teeth which he strove feebly to conceal by constantly passing his hand over the lower part of his face
in spite of his obtrusive baldness he gave the impression of youth
in point of fact he had just turned his thirtieth year
your servant miss morstan he kept repeating in a thin high voice
your servant gentlemen
pray step into my little sanctum
a small place miss but furnished to my own liking
an oasis of art in the howling desert of south london
we were all astonished by the appearance of the apartment into which he invited us
in that sorry house it looked as out of place as a diamond of the first water in a setting of brass
the richest and glossiest of curtains and tapestries draped the walls looped back here and there to expose some richly mounted painting or oriental vase
the carpet was of amber and black so soft and so thick that the foot sank pleasantly into it as into a bed of moss
two great tiger skins thrown athwart it increased the suggestion of eastern luxury as did a huge hookah which stood upon a mat in the corner
a lamp in the fashion of a silver dove was hung from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre of the room
as it burned it filled the air with a subtle and aromatic odor
mr
thaddeus sholto said the little man still jerking and smiling
that is my name
you are miss morstan of course
and these gentlemen this is mr
sherlock holmes and this is dr
watson
a doctor eh
cried he much excited
have you your stethoscope
might i ask you would you have the kindness
i have grave doubts as to my mitral valve if you would be so very good
the aortic i may rely upon but i should value your opinion upon the mitral
i listened to his heart as requested but was unable to find anything amiss save indeed that he was in an ecstasy of fear for he shivered from head to foot
it appears to be normal i said
you have no cause for uneasiness
you will excuse my anxiety miss morstan he remarked airily
i am a great sufferer and i have long had suspicions as to that valve
i am delighted to hear that they are unwarranted
had your father miss morstan refrained from throwing a strain upon his heart he might have been alive now
i could have struck the man across the face so hot was i at this callous and off hand reference to so delicate a matter
miss morstan sat down and her face grew white to the lips
i knew in my heart that he was dead said she
i can give you every information said he and what is more i can do you justice and i will too whatever brother bartholomew may say
i am so glad to have your friends here not only as an escort to you but also as witnesses to what i am about to do and say
the three of us can show a bold front to brother bartholomew
but let us have no outsiders no police or officials
we can settle everything satisfactorily among ourselves without any interference
nothing would annoy brother bartholomew more than any publicity
he sat down upon a low settee and blinked at us inquiringly with his weak watery blue eyes
for my part said holmes whatever you may choose to say will go no further
i nodded to show my agreement
that is well
that is well
said he
may i offer you a glass of chianti miss morstan
or of tokay
i keep no other wines
shall i open a flask
no
well then i trust that you have no objection to tobacco smoke to the mild balsamic odor of the eastern tobacco
i am a little nervous and i find my hookah an invaluable sedative
he applied a taper to the great bowl and the smoke bubbled merrily through the rose water
we sat all three in a semicircle with our heads advanced and our chins upon our hands while the strange jerky little fellow with his high shining head puffed uneasily in the centre
when i first determined to make this communication to you said he i might have given you my address but i feared that you might disregard my request and bring unpleasant people with you
i took the liberty therefore of making an appointment in such a way that my man williams might be able to see you first
i have complete confidence in his discretion and he had orders if he were dissatisfied to proceed no further in the matter
you will excuse these precautions but i am a man of somewhat retiring and i might even say refined tastes and there is nothing more unaesthetic than a policeman
i have a natural shrinking from all forms of rough materialism
i seldom come in contact with the rough crowd
i live as you see with some little atmosphere of elegance around me
i may call myself a patron of the arts
it is my weakness
the landscape is a genuine corot and though a connoisseur might perhaps throw a doubt upon that salvator rosa there cannot be the least question about the bouguereau
i am partial to the modern french school
you will excuse me mr
sholto said miss morstan but i am here at your request to learn something which you desire to tell me
it is very late and i should desire the interview to be as short as possible
at the best it must take some time he answered for we shall certainly have to go to norwood and see brother bartholomew
we shall all go and try if we can get the better of brother bartholomew
he is very angry with me for taking the course which has seemed right to me
i had quite high words with him last night
you cannot imagine what a terrible fellow he is when he is angry
if we are to go to norwood it would perhaps be as well to start at once i ventured to remark
he laughed until his ears were quite red
that would hardly do he cried
i don't know what he would say if i brought you in that sudden way
no i must prepare you by showing you how we all stand to each other
in the first place i must tell you that there are several points in the story of which i am myself ignorant
i can only lay the facts before you as far as i know them myself
my father was as you may have guessed major john sholto once of the indian army
he retired some eleven years ago and came to live at pondicherry lodge in upper norwood
he had prospered in india and brought back with him a considerable sum of money a large collection of valuable curiosities and a staff of native servants
with these advantages he bought himself a house and lived in great luxury
my twin brother bartholomew and i were the only children
i very well remember the sensation which was caused by the disappearance of captain morstan
we read the details in the papers and knowing that he had been a friend of our father's we discussed the case freely in his presence
he used to join in our speculations as to what could have happened
never for an instant did we suspect that he had the whole secret hidden in his own breast that of all men he alone knew the fate of arthur morstan
we did know however that some mystery some positive danger overhung our father
he was very fearful of going out alone and he always employed two prize fighters to act as porters at pondicherry lodge
williams who drove you to night was one of them
he was once light weight champion of england
our father would never tell us what it was he feared but he had a most marked aversion to men with wooden legs
on one occasion he actually fired his revolver at a wooden legged man who proved to be a harmless tradesman canvassing for orders
we had to pay a large sum to hush the matter up
my brother and i used to think this a mere whim of my father's but events have since led us to change our opinion
early in my father received a letter from india which was a great shock to him
he nearly fainted at the breakfast table when he opened it and from that day he sickened to his death
what was in the letter we could never discover but i could see as he held it that it was short and written in a scrawling hand
he had suffered for years from an enlarged spleen but he now became rapidly worse and towards the end of april we were informed that he was beyond all hope and that he wished to make a last communication to us
when we entered his room he was propped up with pillows and breathing heavily
he besought us to lock the door and to come upon either side of the bed
then grasping our hands he made a remarkable statement to us in a voice which was broken as much by emotion as by pain
i shall try and give it to you in his own very words
'i have only one thing ' he said 'which weighs upon my mind at this supreme moment
it is my treatment of poor morstan's orphan
the cursed greed which has been my besetting sin through life has withheld from her the treasure half at least of which should have been hers
and yet i have made no use of it myself so blind and foolish a thing is avarice
the mere feeling of possession has been so dear to me that i could not bear to share it with another
see that chaplet dipped with pearls beside the quinine bottle
even that i could not bear to part with although i had got it out with the design of sending it to her
you my sons will give her a fair share of the agra treasure
but send her nothing not even the chaplet until i am gone
after all men have been as bad as this and have recovered
'i will tell you how morstan died ' he continued
'he had suffered for years from a weak heart but he concealed it from every one
i alone knew it
when in india he and i through a remarkable chain of circumstances came into possession of a considerable treasure
i brought it over to england and on the night of morstan's arrival he came straight over here to claim his share
he walked over from the station and was admitted by my faithful lal chowdar who is now dead
morstan and i had a difference of opinion as to the division of the treasure and we came to heated words
morstan had sprung out of his chair in a paroxysm of anger when he suddenly pressed his hand to his side his face turned a dusky hue and he fell backwards cutting his head against the corner of the treasure chest
when i stooped over him i found to my horror that he was dead
'for a long time i sat half distracted wondering what i should do
my first impulse was of course to call for assistance but i could not but recognize that there was every chance that i would be accused of his murder
his death at the moment of a quarrel and the gash in his head would be black against me
again an official inquiry could not be made without bringing out some facts about the treasure which i was particularly anxious to keep secret
he had told me that no soul upon earth knew where he had gone
there seemed to be no necessity why any soul ever should know
'i was still pondering over the matter when looking up i saw my servant lal chowdar in the doorway
he stole in and bolted the door behind him
do not fear sahib he said
no one need know that you have killed him
let us hide him away and who is the wiser
i did not kill him said i lal chowdar shook his head and smiled
i heard it all sahib said he
i heard you quarrel and i heard the blow
but my lips are sealed
all are asleep in the house
let us put him away together
that was enough to decide me
if my own servant could not believe my innocence how could i hope to make it good before twelve foolish tradesmen in a jury box
lal chowdar and i disposed of the body that night and within a few days the london papers were full of the mysterious disappearance of captain morstan
you will see from what i say that i can hardly be blamed in the matter
my fault lies in the fact that we concealed not only the body but also the treasure and that i have clung to morstan's share as well as to my own
i wish you therefore to make restitution
put your ears down to my mouth
the treasure is hidden in ' at this instant a horrible change came over his expression his eyes stared wildly his jaw dropped and he yelled in a voice which i can never forget 'keep him out
for christ's sake keep him out '
we both stared round at the window behind us upon which his gaze was fixed
a face was looking in at us out of the darkness
we could see the whitening of the nose where it was pressed against the glass
it was a bearded hairy face with wild cruel eyes and an expression of concentrated malevolence
my brother and i rushed towards the window but the man was gone
when we returned to my father his head had dropped and his pulse had ceased to beat
we searched the garden that night but found no sign of the intruder save that just under the window a single footmark was visible in the flower bed
but for that one trace we might have thought that our imaginations had conjured up that wild fierce face
we soon however had another and a more striking proof that there were secret agencies at work all round us
the window of my father's room was found open in the morning his cupboards and boxes had been rifled and upon his chest was fixed a torn piece of paper with the words 'the sign of the four' scrawled across it
what the phrase meant or who our secret visitor may have been we never knew
as far as we can judge none of my father's property had been actually stolen though everything had been turned out
my brother and i naturally associated this peculiar incident with the fear which haunted my father during his life but it is still a complete mystery to us
the little man stopped to relight his hookah and puffed thoughtfully for a few moments
we had all sat absorbed listening to his extraordinary narrative
at the short account of her father's death miss morstan had turned deadly white and for a moment i feared that she was about to faint
she rallied however on drinking a glass of water which i quietly poured out for her from a venetian carafe upon the side table
sherlock holmes leaned back in his chair with an abstracted expression and the lids drawn low over his glittering eyes
as i glanced at him i could not but think how on that very day he had complained bitterly of the commonplaceness of life
here at least was a problem which would tax his sagacity to the utmost
mr
thaddeus sholto looked from one to the other of us with an obvious pride at the effect which his story had produced and then continued between the puffs of his overgrown pipe
my brother and i said he were as you may imagine much excited as to the treasure which my father had spoken of
for weeks and for months we dug and delved in every part of the garden without discovering its whereabouts
it was maddening to think that the hiding place was on his very lips at the moment that he died
we could judge the splendor of the missing riches by the chaplet which he had taken out
over this chaplet my brother bartholomew and i had some little discussion
the pearls were evidently of great value and he was averse to part with them for between friends my brother was himself a little inclined to my father's fault
he thought too that if we parted with the chaplet it might give rise to gossip and finally bring us into trouble
it was all that i could do to persuade him to let me find out miss morstan's address and send her a detached pearl at fixed intervals so that at least she might never feel destitute
it was a kindly thought said our companion earnestly
it was extremely good of you
the little man waved his hand deprecatingly
we were your trustees he said
that was the view which i took of it though brother bartholomew could not altogether see it in that light
we had plenty of money ourselves
i desired no more
besides it would have been such bad taste to have treated a young lady in so scurvy a fashion
'le mauvais gout mene au crime '
the french have a very neat way of putting these things
our difference of opinion on this subject went so far that i thought it best to set up rooms for myself so i left pondicherry lodge taking the old khitmutgar and williams with me
yesterday however i learn that an event of extreme importance has occurred
the treasure has been discovered
i instantly communicated with miss morstan and it only remains for us to drive out to norwood and demand our share
i explained my views last night to brother bartholomew so we shall be expected if not welcome visitors
mr
thaddeus sholto ceased and sat twitching on his luxurious settee
we all remained silent with our thoughts upon the new development which the mysterious business had taken
holmes was the first to spring to his feet
you have done well sir from first to last said he
it is possible that we may be able to make you some small return by throwing some light upon that which is still dark to you
but as miss morstan remarked just now it is late and we had best put the matter through without delay
our new acquaintance very deliberately coiled up the tube of his hookah and produced from behind a curtain a very long befrogged topcoat with astrakhan collar and cuffs
this he buttoned tightly up in spite of the extreme closeness of the night and finished his attire by putting on a rabbit skin cap with hanging lappets which covered the ears so that no part of him was visible save his mobile and peaky face
my health is somewhat fragile he remarked as he led the way down the passage
i am compelled to be a valetudinarian
our cab was awaiting us outside and our programme was evidently prearranged for the driver started off at once at a rapid pace
thaddeus sholto talked incessantly in a voice which rose high above the rattle of the wheels
bartholomew is a clever fellow said he
how do you think he found out where the treasure was
he had come to the conclusion that it was somewhere indoors so he worked out all the cubic space of the house and made measurements everywhere so that not one inch should be unaccounted for
among other things he found that the height of the building was seventy four feet but on adding together the heights of all the separate rooms and making every allowance for the space between which he ascertained by borings he could not bring the total to more than seventy feet
there were four feet unaccounted for
these could only be at the top of the building
he knocked a hole therefore in the lath and plaster ceiling of the highest room and there sure enough he came upon another little garret above it which had been sealed up and was known to no one
in the centre stood the treasure chest resting upon two rafters
he lowered it through the hole and there it lies
he computes the value of the jewels at not less than half a million sterling
at the mention of this gigantic sum we all stared at one another open eyed
miss morstan could we secure her rights would change from a needy governess to the richest heiress in england
surely it was the place of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news yet i am ashamed to say that selfishness took me by the soul and that my heart turned as heavy as lead within me
i stammered out some few halting words of congratulation and then sat downcast with my head drooped deaf to the babble of our new acquaintance
he was clearly a confirmed hypochondriac and i was dreamily conscious that he was pouring forth interminable trains of symptoms and imploring information as to the composition and action of innumerable quack nostrums some of which he bore about in a leather case in his pocket
i trust that he may not remember any of the answers which i gave him that night
holmes declares that he overheard me caution him against the great danger of taking more than two drops of castor oil while i recommended strychnine in large doses as a sedative
however that may be i was certainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coachman sprang down to open the door
this miss morstan is pondicherry lodge said mr
thaddeus sholto as he handed her out
it was nearly eleven o'clock when we reached this final stage of our night's adventures
we had left the damp fog of the great city behind us and the night was fairly fine
a warm wind blew from the westward and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky with half a moon peeping occasionally through the rifts
it was clear enough to see for some distance but thaddeus sholto took down one of the side lamps from the carriage to give us a better light upon our way
pondicherry lodge stood in its own grounds and was girt round with a very high stone wall topped with broken glass
a single narrow iron clamped door formed the only means of entrance
on this our guide knocked with a peculiar postman like rat tat
who is there
cried a gruff voice from within
it is i mcmurdo
you surely know my knock by this time
there was a grumbling sound and a clanking and jarring of keys
the door swung heavily back and a short deep chested man stood in the opening with the yellow light of the lantern shining upon his protruded face and twinkling distrustful eyes
that you mr
thaddeus
but who are the others
i had no orders about them from the master
no mcmurdo
you surprise me
i told my brother last night that i should bring some friends
he ain't been out o' his room to day mr
thaddeus and i have no orders
you know very well that i must stick to regulations
i can let you in but your friends must just stop where they are
this was an unexpected obstacle
thaddeus sholto looked about him in a perplexed and helpless manner
this is too bad of you mcmurdo
he said
if i guarantee them that is enough for you
there is the young lady too
she cannot wait on the public road at this hour
very sorry mr
thaddeus said the porter inexorably
folk may be friends o' yours and yet no friends o' the master's
he pays me well to do my duty and my duty i'll do
i don't know none o' your friends
oh yes you do mcmurdo cried sherlock holmes genially
i don't think you can have forgotten me
don't you remember the amateur who fought three rounds with you at alison's rooms on the night of your benefit four years back
not mr
sherlock holmes
roared the prize fighter
god's truth
how could i have mistook you
if instead o' standin' there so quiet you had just stepped up and given me that cross hit of yours under the jaw i'd ha' known you without a question
ah you're one that has wasted your gifts you have
you might have aimed high if you had joined the fancy
you see watson if all else fails me i have still one of the scientific professions open to me said holmes laughing
our friend won't keep us out in the cold now i am sure
in you come sir in you come you and your friends he answered
very sorry mr
thaddeus but orders are very strict
had to be certain of your friends before i let them in
inside a gravel path wound through desolate grounds to a huge clump of a house square and prosaic all plunged in shadow save where a moonbeam struck one corner and glimmered in a garret window
the vast size of the building with its gloom and its deathly silence struck a chill to the heart
even thaddeus sholto seemed ill at ease and the lantern quivered and rattled in his hand
i cannot understand it he said
there must be some mistake
i distinctly told bartholomew that we should be here and yet there is no light in his window
i do not know what to make of it
does he always guard the premises in this way
asked holmes
yes he has followed my father's custom
he was the favorite son you know and i sometimes think that my father may have told him more than he ever told me
that is bartholomew's window up there where the moonshine strikes
it is quite bright but there is no light from within i think
none said holmes
but i see the glint of a light in that little window beside the door
ah that is the housekeeper's room
that is where old mrs
bernstone sits
she can tell us all about it
but perhaps you would not mind waiting here for a minute or two for if we all go in together and she has no word of our coming she may be alarmed
but hush
what is that
he held up the lantern and his hand shook until the circles of light flickered and wavered all round us
miss morstan seized my wrist and we all stood with thumping hearts straining our ears
from the great black house there sounded through the silent night the saddest and most pitiful of sounds the shrill broken whimpering of a frightened woman
it is mrs
bernstone said sholto
she is the only woman in the house
wait here
i shall be back in a moment
he hurried for the door and knocked in his peculiar way
we could see a tall old woman admit him and sway with pleasure at the very sight of him
oh mr
thaddeus sir i am so glad you have come
i am so glad you have come mr
thaddeus sir
we heard her reiterated rejoicings until the door was closed and her voice died away into a muffled monotone
our guide had left us the lantern
holmes swung it slowly round and peered keenly at the house and at the great rubbish heaps which cumbered the grounds
miss morstan and i stood together and her hand was in mine
a wondrous subtle thing is love for here were we two who had never seen each other before that day between whom no word or even look of affection had ever passed and yet now in an hour of trouble our hands instinctively sought for each other
i have marvelled at it since but at the time it seemed the most natural thing that i should go out to her so and as she has often told me there was in her also the instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection
so we stood hand in hand like two children and there was peace in our hearts for all the dark things that surrounded us
what a strange place
she said looking round
it looks as though all the moles in england had been let loose in it
i have seen something of the sort on the side of a hill near ballarat where the prospectors had been at work
and from the same cause said holmes
these are the traces of the treasure seekers
you must remember that they were six years looking for it
no wonder that the grounds look like a gravel pit
at that moment the door of the house burst open and thaddeus sholto came running out with his hands thrown forward and terror in his eyes
there is something amiss with bartholomew
he cried
i am frightened
my nerves cannot stand it
he was indeed half blubbering with fear and his twitching feeble face peeping out from the great astrakhan collar had the helpless appealing expression of a terrified child
come into the house said holmes in his crisp firm way
yes do
pleaded thaddeus sholto
i really do not feel equal to giving directions
we all followed him into the housekeeper's room which stood upon the left hand side of the passage
the old woman was pacing up and down with a scared look and restless picking fingers but the sight of miss morstan appeared to have a soothing effect upon her
god bless your sweet calm face
she cried with an hysterical sob
it does me good to see you
oh but i have been sorely tried this day
our companion patted her thin work worn hand and murmured some few words of kindly womanly comfort which brought the color back into the others bloodless cheeks
master has locked himself in and will not answer me she explained
all day i have waited to hear from him for he often likes to be alone but an hour ago i feared that something was amiss so i went up and peeped through the key hole
you must go up mr
thaddeus you must go up and look for yourself
i have seen mr
bartholomew sholto in joy and in sorrow for ten long years but i never saw him with such a face on him as that
sherlock holmes took the lamp and led the way for thaddeus sholto's teeth were chattering in his head
so shaken was he that i had to pass my hand under his arm as we went up the stairs for his knees were trembling under him
twice as we ascended holmes whipped his lens out of his pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to me to be mere shapeless smudges of dust upon the cocoa nut matting which served as a stair carpet
he walked slowly from step to step holding the lamp and shooting keen glances to right and left
miss morstan had remained behind with the frightened housekeeper
the third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some length with a great picture in indian tapestry upon the right of it and three doors upon the left
holmes advanced along it in the same slow and methodical way while we kept close at his heels with our long black shadows streaming backwards down the corridor
the third door was that which we were seeking
holmes knocked without receiving any answer and then tried to turn the handle and force it open
it was locked on the inside however and by a broad and powerful bolt as we could see when we set our lamp up against it
the key being turned however the hole was not entirely closed
sherlock holmes bent down to it and instantly rose again with a sharp intaking of the breath
there is something devilish in this watson said he more moved than i had ever before seen him
what do you make of it
i stooped to the hole and recoiled in horror
moonlight was streaming into the room and it was bright with a vague and shifty radiance
looking straight at me and suspended as it were in the air for all beneath was in shadow there hung a face the very face of our companion thaddeus
there was the same high shining head the same circular bristle of red hair the same bloodless countenance
the features were set however in a horrible smile a fixed and unnatural grin which in that still and moonlit room was more jarring to the nerves than any scowl or contortion
so like was the face to that of our little friend that i looked round at him to make sure that he was indeed with us
then i recalled to mind that he had mentioned to us that his brother and he were twins
this is terrible
i said to holmes
what is to be done
the door must come down he answered and springing against it he put all his weight upon the lock
it creaked and groaned but did not yield
together we flung ourselves upon it once more and this time it gave way with a sudden snap and we found ourselves within bartholomew sholto's chamber
it appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory
a double line of glass stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the door and the table was littered over with bunsen burners test tubes and retorts
in the corners stood carboys of acid in wicker baskets
one of these appeared to leak or to have been broken for a stream of dark colored liquid had trickled out from it and the air was heavy with a peculiarly pungent tar like odor
a set of steps stood at one side of the room in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster and above them there was an opening in the ceiling large enough for a man to pass through
at the foot of the steps a long coil of rope was thrown carelessly together
by the table in a wooden arm chair the master of the house was seated all in a heap with his head sunk upon his left shoulder and that ghastly inscrutable smile upon his face
he was stiff and cold and had clearly been dead many hours
it seemed to me that not only his features but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the most fantastic fashion
by his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar instrument a brown close grained stick with a stone head like a hammer rudely lashed on with coarse twine
beside it was a torn sheet of note paper with some words scrawled upon it
holmes glanced at it and then handed it to me
you see he said with a significant raising of the eyebrows
in the light of the lantern i read with a thrill of horror the sign of the four
in god's name what does it all mean
i asked
it means murder said he stooping over the dead man
ah i expected it
look here
he pointed to what looked like a long dark thorn stuck in the skin just above the ear
it looks like a thorn said i
it is a thorn
you may pick it out
but be careful for it is poisoned
i took it up between my finger and thumb
it came away from the skin so readily that hardly any mark was left behind
one tiny speck of blood showed where the puncture had been
this is all an insoluble mystery to me said i
it grows darker instead of clearer
on the contrary he answered it clears every instant
i only require a few missing links to have an entirely connected case
we had almost forgotten our companion's presence since we entered the chamber
he was still standing in the door way the very picture of terror wringing his hands and moaning to himself
suddenly however he broke out into a sharp querulous cry
the treasure is gone
he said
they have robbed him of the treasure
there is the hole through which we lowered it
i helped him to do it
i was the last person who saw him
i left him here last night and i heard him lock the door as i came down stairs
what time was that
it was ten o'clock
and now he is dead and the police will be called in and i shall be suspected of having had a hand in it
oh yes i am sure i shall
but you don't think so gentlemen
surely you don't think that it was i
is it likely that i would have brought you here if it were i
oh dear
oh dear
i know that i shall go mad
he jerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive frenzy
you have no reason for fear mr
sholto said holmes kindly putting his hand upon his shoulder
take my advice and drive down to the station to report this matter to the police
offer to assist them in every way
we shall wait here until your return
the little man obeyed in a half stupefied fashion and we heard him stumbling down the stairs in the dark
now watson said holmes rubbing his hands we have half an hour to ourselves
let us make good use of it
my case is as i have told you almost complete but we must not err on the side of over confidence
simple as the case seems now there may be something deeper underlying it
simple
i ejaculated
surely said he with something of the air of a clinical professor expounding to his class
just sit in the corner there that your footprints may not complicate matters
now to work
in the first place how did these folk come and how did they go
the door has not been opened since last night
how of the window
he carried the lamp across to it muttering his observations aloud the while but addressing them to himself rather than to me
window is snibbed on the inner side
framework is solid
no hinges at the side
let us open it
no water pipe near
roof quite out of reach
yet a man has mounted by the window
it rained a little last night
here is the print of a foot in mould upon the sill
and here is a circular muddy mark and here again upon the floor and here again by the table
see here watson
this is really a very pretty demonstration
i looked at the round well defined muddy discs
this is not a footmark said i
it is something much more valuable to us
it is the impression of a wooden stump
you see here on the sill is the boot mark a heavy boot with the broad metal heel and beside it is the mark of the timber toe
it is the wooden legged man
quite so
but there has been some one else a very able and efficient ally
could you scale that wall doctor
i looked out of the open window
the moon still shone brightly on that angle of the house
we were a good sixty feet from the ground and look where i would i could see no foothold nor as much as a crevice in the brick work
it is absolutely impossible i answered
without aid it is so
but suppose you had a friend up here who lowered you this good stout rope which i see in the corner securing one end of it to this great hook in the wall
then i think if you were an active man you might swarm up wooden leg and all
you would depart of course in the same fashion and your ally would draw up the rope untie it from the hook shut the window snib it on the inside and get away in the way that he originally came
as a minor point it may be noted he continued fingering the rope that our wooden legged friend though a fair climber was not a professional sailor
his hands were far from horny
my lens discloses more than one blood mark especially towards the end of the rope from which i gather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin off his hand
this is all very well said i but the thing becomes more unintelligible than ever
how about this mysterious ally
how came he into the room
yes the ally
repeated holmes pensively
there are features of interest about this ally
he lifts the case from the regions of the commonplace
i fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals of crime in this country though parallel cases suggest themselves from india and if my memory serves me from senegambia
how came he then
i reiterated
the door is locked the window is inaccessible
was it through the chimney
the grate is much too small he answered
i had already considered that possibility
how then
i persisted
you will not apply my precept he said shaking his head
how often have i said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth
we know that he did not come through the door the window or the chimney
we also know that he could not have been concealed in the room as there is no concealment possible
whence then did he come
he came through the hole in the roof i cried
of course he did
he must have done so
if you will have the kindness to hold the lamp for me we shall now extend our researches to the room above the secret room in which the treasure was found
he mounted the steps and seizing a rafter with either hand he swung himself up into the garret
then lying on his face he reached down for the lamp and held it while i followed him
the chamber in which we found ourselves was about ten feet one way and six the other
the floor was formed by the rafters with thin lath and plaster between so that in walking one had to step from beam to beam
the roof ran up to an apex and was evidently the inner shell of the true roof of the house
there was no furniture of any sort and the accumulated dust of years lay thick upon the floor
here you are you see said sherlock holmes putting his hand against the sloping wall
this is a trap door which leads out on to the roof
i can press it back and here is the roof itself sloping at a gentle angle
this then is the way by which number one entered
let us see if we can find any other traces of his individuality
he held down the lamp to the floor and as he did so i saw for the second time that night a startled surprised look come over his face
for myself as i followed his gaze my skin was cold under my clothes
the floor was covered thickly with the prints of a naked foot clear well defined perfectly formed but scarce half the size of those of an ordinary man
holmes i said in a whisper a child has done the horrid thing
he had recovered his self possession in an instant
i was staggered for the moment he said but the thing is quite natural
my memory failed me or i should have been able to foretell it
there is nothing more to be learned here
let us go down
what is your theory then as to those footmarks
i asked eagerly when we had regained the lower room once more
my dear watson try a little analysis yourself said he with a touch of impatience
you know my methods
apply them and it will be instructive to compare results
i cannot conceive anything which will cover the facts i answered
it will be clear enough to you soon he said in an off hand way
i think that there is nothing else of importance here but i will look
he whipped out his lens and a tape measure and hurried about the room on his knees measuring comparing examining with his long thin nose only a few inches from the planks and his beady eyes gleaming and deep set like those of a bird
so swift silent and furtive were his movements like those of a trained blood hound picking out a scent that i could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made had he turned his energy and sagacity against the law instead of exerting them in its defense
as he hunted about he kept muttering to himself and finally he broke out into a loud crow of delight
we are certainly in luck said he
we ought to have very little trouble now
number one has had the misfortune to tread in the creosote
you can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here at the side of this evil smelling mess
the carboy has been cracked you see and the stuff has leaked out
what then
i asked
why we have got him that's all said he
i know a dog that would follow that scent to the world's end
if a pack can track a trailed herring across a shire how far can a specially trained hound follow so pungent a smell as this
it sounds like a sum in the rule of three
the answer should give us the but halloo
here are the accredited representatives of the law
heavy steps and the clamor of loud voices were audible from below and the hall door shut with a loud crash
before they come said holmes just put your hand here on this poor fellow's arm and here on his leg
what do you feel
the muscles are as hard as a board i answered
quite so
they are in a state of extreme contraction far exceeding the usual rigor mortis
coupled with this distortion of the face this hippocratic smile or 'risus sardonicus ' as the old writers called it what conclusion would it suggest to your mind
death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid i answered some strychnine like substance which would produce tetanus
that was the idea which occurred to me the instant i saw the drawn muscles of the face
on getting into the room i at once looked for the means by which the poison had entered the system
as you saw i discovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force into the scalp
you observe that the part struck was that which would be turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in his chair
now examine the thorn
i took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern
it was long sharp and black with a glazed look near the point as though some gummy substance had dried upon it
the blunt end had been trimmed and rounded off with a knife
is that an english thorn
he asked
no it certainly is not
with all these data you should be able to draw some just inference
but here are the regulars so the auxiliary forces may beat a retreat
as he spoke the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly on the passage and a very stout portly man in a gray suit strode heavily into the room
he was red faced burly and plethoric with a pair of very small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from between swollen and puffy pouches
he was closely followed by an inspector in uniform and by the still palpitating thaddeus sholto
here's a business
he cried in a muffled husky voice
here's a pretty business
but who are all these
why the house seems to be as full as a rabbit warren
i think you must recollect me mr
athelney jones said holmes quietly
why of course i do
he wheezed
it's mr
sherlock holmes the theorist
remember you
i'll never forget how you lectured us all on causes and inferences and effects in the bishopgate jewel case
it's true you set us on the right track but you'll own now that it was more by good luck than good guidance
it was a piece of very simple reasoning
oh come now come
never be ashamed to own up
but what is all this
bad business
bad business
stern facts here no room for theories
how lucky that i happened to be out at norwood over another case
i was at the station when the message arrived
what d'you think the man died of
oh this is hardly a case for me to theorize over said holmes dryly
no no
still we can't deny that you hit the nail on the head sometimes
dear me
door locked i understand
jewels worth half a million missing
how was the window
fastened but there are steps on the sill
well well if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do with the matter
that's common sense
man might have died in a fit but then the jewels are missing
ha
i have a theory
these flashes come upon me at times just step outside sergeant and you mr
sholto
your friend can remain what do you think of this holmes
sholto was on his own confession with his brother last night
the brother died in a fit on which sholto walked off with the treasure
how's that
on which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door on the inside
hum
there's a flaw there
let us apply common sense to the matter
this thaddeus sholto was with his brother there was a quarrel so much we know
the brother is dead and the jewels are gone
so much also we know
no one saw the brother from the time thaddeus left him
his bed had not been slept in
thaddeus is evidently in a most disturbed state of mind
his appearance is well not attractive
you see that i am weaving my web round thaddeus
the net begins to close upon him
you are not quite in possession of the facts yet said holmes
this splinter of wood which i have every reason to believe to be poisoned was in the man's scalp where you still see the mark this card inscribed as you see it was on the table and beside it lay this rather curious stone headed instrument
how does all that fit into your theory
confirms it in every respect said the fat detective pompously
house is full of indian curiosities
thaddeus brought this up and if this splinter be poisonous thaddeus may as well have made murderous use of it as any other man
the card is some hocus pocus a blind as like as not
the only question is how did he depart
ah of course here is a hole in the roof
with great activity considering his bulk he sprang up the steps and squeezed through into the garret and immediately afterwards we heard his exulting voice proclaiming that he had found the trap door
he can find something remarked holmes shrugging his shoulders
he has occasional glimmerings of reason
_il n'y a pas des sots si incommodes que ceux qui ont de l'esprit _ you see
said athelney jones reappearing down the steps again
facts are better than mere theories after all
my view of the case is confirmed
there is a trap door communicating with the roof and it is partly open
it was i who opened it
oh indeed
you did notice it then
he seemed a little crestfallen at the discovery
well whoever noticed it it shows how our gentleman got away
inspector
yes sir from the passage
ask mr
sholto to step this way mr
sholto it is my duty to inform you that anything which you may say will be used against you
i arrest you in the queen's name as being concerned in the death of your brother
there now
didn't i tell you
cried the poor little man throwing out his hands and looking from one to the other of us
don't trouble yourself about it mr
sholto said holmes
i think that i can engage to clear you of the charge
don't promise too much mr
theorist don't promise too much
snapped the detective
you may find it a harder matter than you think
not only will i clear him mr
jones but i will make you a free present of the name and description of one of the two people who were in this room last night
his name i have every reason to believe is jonathan small
he is a poorly educated man small active with his right leg off and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the inner side
his left boot has a coarse square toed sole with an iron band round the heel
he is a middle aged man much sunburned and has been a convict
these few indications may be of some assistance to you coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing from the palm of his hand
the other man ah
the other man
asked athelney jones in a sneering voice but impressed none the less as i could easily see by the precision of the other's manner
is a rather curious person said sherlock holmes turning upon his heel
i hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair of them a word with you watson
he led me out to the head of the stair
this unexpected occurrence he said has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of our journey
i have just been thinking so i answered
it is not right that miss morstan should remain in this stricken house
no
you must escort her home
she lives with mrs
cecil forrester in lower camberwell so it is not very far
i will wait for you here if you will drive out again
or perhaps you are too tired
by no means
i don't think i could rest until i know more of this fantastic business
i have seen something of the rough side of life but i give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprises to night has shaken my nerve completely
i should like however to see the matter through with you now that i have got so far
your presence will be of great service to me he answered
we shall work the case out independently and leave this fellow jones to exult over any mare's nest which he may choose to construct
when you have dropped miss morstan i wish you to go on to no
pinchin lane down near the water's edge at lambeth
the third house on the right hand side is a bird stuffer's sherman is the name
you will see a weasel holding a young rabbit in the window
knock old sherman up and tell him with my compliments that i want toby at once
you will bring toby back in the cab with you
a dog i suppose
yes a queer mongrel with a most amazing power of scent
i would rather have toby's help than that of the whole detective force of london
i shall bring him then said i
it is one now
i ought to be back before three if i can get a fresh horse
and i said holmes shall see what i can learn from mrs
bernstone and from the indian servant who mr
thaddeus tell me sleeps in the next garret
then i shall study the great jones's methods and listen to his not too delicate sarcasms
'wir sind gewohnt das die menschen verhoehnen was sie nicht verstehen '
goethe is always pithy
the police had brought a cab with them and in this i escorted miss morstan back to her home
after the angelic fashion of women she had borne trouble with a calm face as long as there was some one weaker than herself to support and i had found her bright and placid by the side of the frightened housekeeper
in the cab however she first turned faint and then burst into a passion of weeping so sorely had she been tried by the adventures of the night
she has told me since that she thought me cold and distant upon that journey
she little guessed the struggle within my breast or the effort of self restraint which held me back
my sympathies and my love went out to her even as my hand had in the garden
i felt that years of the conventionalities of life could not teach me to know her sweet brave nature as had this one day of strange experiences
yet there were two thoughts which sealed the words of affection upon my lips
she was weak and helpless shaken in mind and nerve
it was to take her at a disadvantage to obtrude love upon her at such a time
worse still she was rich
if holmes's researches were successful she would be an heiress
was it fair was it honorable that a half pay surgeon should take such advantage of an intimacy which chance had brought about
might she not look upon me as a mere vulgar fortune seeker
i could not bear to risk that such a thought should cross her mind
this agra treasure intervened like an impassable barrier between us
it was nearly two o'clock when we reached mrs
cecil forrester's
the servants had retired hours ago but mrs
forrester had been so interested by the strange message which miss morstan had received that she had sat up in the hope of her return
she opened the door herself a middle aged graceful woman and it gave me joy to see how tenderly her arm stole round the other's waist and how motherly was the voice in which she greeted her
she was clearly no mere paid dependant but an honored friend
i was introduced and mrs
forrester earnestly begged me to step in and tell her our adventures
i explained however the importance of my errand and promised faithfully to call and report any progress which we might make with the case
as we drove away i stole a glance back and i still seem to see that little group on the step the two graceful clinging figures the half opened door the hall light shining through stained glass the barometer and the bright stair rods
it was soothing to catch even that passing glimpse of a tranquil english home in the midst of the wild dark business which had absorbed us
and the more i thought of what had happened the wilder and darker it grew
i reviewed the whole extraordinary sequence of events as i rattled on through the silent gas lit streets
there was the original problem that at least was pretty clear now
the death of captain morstan the sending of the pearls the advertisement the letter we had had light upon all those events
they had only led us however to a deeper and far more tragic mystery
the indian treasure the curious plan found among morstan's baggage the strange scene at major sholto's death the rediscovery of the treasure immediately followed by the murder of the discoverer the very singular accompaniments to the crime the footsteps the remarkable weapons the words upon the card corresponding with those upon captain morstan's chart here was indeed a labyrinth in which a man less singularly endowed than my fellow lodger might well despair of ever finding the clue
pinchin lane was a row of shabby two storied brick houses in the lower quarter of lambeth
i had to knock for some time at no
before i could make my impression
at last however there was the glint of a candle behind the blind and a face looked out at the upper window
go on you drunken vagabone said the face
if you kick up any more row i'll open the kennels and let out forty three dogs upon you
if you'll let one out it's just what i have come for said i
go on
yelled the voice
so help me gracious i have a wiper in the bag an' i'll drop it on your 'ead if you don't hook it
but i want a dog i cried
i won't be argued with
shouted mr
sherman
now stand clear for when i say 'three ' down goes the wiper
mr
sherlock holmes i began but the words had a most magical effect for the window instantly slammed down and within a minute the door was unbarred and open
mr
sherman was a lanky lean old man with stooping shoulders a stringy neck and blue tinted glasses
a friend of mr
sherlock is always welcome said he
step in sir
keep clear of the badger for he bites
ah naughty naughty would you take a nip at the gentleman
this to a stoat which thrust its wicked head and red eyes between the bars of its cage
don't mind that sir it's only a slow worm
it hain't got no fangs so i gives it the run o' the room for it keeps the beetles down
you must not mind my bein' just a little short wi' you at first for i'm guyed at by the children and there's many a one just comes down this lane to knock me up
what was it that mr
sherlock holmes wanted sir
he wanted a dog of yours
ah
that would be toby
yes toby was the name
toby lives at no
on the left here
he moved slowly forward with his candle among the queer animal family which he had gathered round him
in the uncertain shadowy light i could see dimly that there were glancing glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every cranny and corner
even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn fowls who lazily shifted their weight from one leg to the other as our voices disturbed their slumbers
toby proved to be an ugly long haired lop eared creature half spaniel and half lurcher brown and white in color with a very clumsy waddling gait
it accepted after some hesitation a lump of sugar which the old naturalist handed to me and having thus sealed an alliance it followed me to the cab and made no difficulties about accompanying me
it had just struck three on the palace clock when i found myself back once more at pondicherry lodge
the ex prize fighter mcmurdo had i found been arrested as an accessory and both he and mr
sholto had been marched off to the station
two constables guarded the narrow gate but they allowed me to pass with the dog on my mentioning the detective's name
holmes was standing on the door step with his hands in his pockets smoking his pipe
ah you have him there
said he
good dog then
atheney jones has gone
we have had an immense display of energy since you left
he has arrested not only friend thaddeus but the gatekeeper the housekeeper and the indian servant
we have the place to ourselves but for a sergeant up stairs
leave the dog here and come up
we tied toby to the hall table and reascended the stairs
the room was as he had left it save that a sheet had been draped over the central figure
a weary looking police sergeant reclined in the corner
lend me your bull's eye sergeant said my companion
now tie this bit of card round my neck so as to hang it in front of me
thank you
now i must kick off my boots and stockings just you carry them down with you watson
i am going to do a little climbing
and dip my handkerchief into the creasote
that will do
now come up into the garret with me for a moment
we clambered up through the hole
holmes turned his light once more upon the footsteps in the dust
i wish you particularly to notice these footmarks he said
do you observe anything noteworthy about them
they belong i said to a child or a small woman
apart from their size though
is there nothing else
they appear to be much as other footmarks
not at all
look here
this is the print of a right foot in the dust
now i make one with my naked foot beside it
what is the chief difference
your toes are all cramped together
the other print has each toe distinctly divided
quite so
that is the point
bear that in mind
now would you kindly step over to that flap window and smell the edge of the wood work
i shall stay here as i have this handkerchief in my hand
i did as he directed and was instantly conscious of a strong tarry smell
that is where he put his foot in getting out
if you can trace him i should think that toby will have no difficulty
now run down stairs loose the dog and look out for blondin
by the time that i got out into the grounds sherlock holmes was on the roof and i could see him like an enormous glow worm crawling very slowly along the ridge
i lost sight of him behind a stack of chimneys but he presently reappeared and then vanished once more upon the opposite side
when i made my way round there i found him seated at one of the corner eaves
that you watson
he cried
yes
this is the place
what is that black thing down there
a water barrel
top on it
yes
no sign of a ladder
no
confound the fellow
it's a most break neck place
i ought to be able to come down where he could climb up
the water pipe feels pretty firm
here goes anyhow
there was a scuffling of feet and the lantern began to come steadily down the side of the wall
then with a light spring he came on to the barrel and from there to the earth
it was easy to follow him he said drawing on his stockings and boots
tiles were loosened the whole way along and in his hurry he had dropped this
it confirms my diagnosis as you doctors express it
the object which he held up to me was a small pocket or pouch woven out of colored grasses and with a few tawdry beads strung round it
in shape and size it was not unlike a cigarette case
inside were half a dozen spines of dark wood sharp at one end and rounded at the other like that which had struck bartholomew sholto
they are hellish things said he
look out that you don't prick yourself
i'm delighted to have them for the chances are that they are all he has
there is the less fear of you or me finding one in our skin before long
i would sooner face a martini bullet myself
are you game for a six mile trudge watson
certainly i answered
your leg will stand it
oh yes
here you are doggy
good old toby
smell it toby smell it
he pushed the creasote handkerchief under the dog's nose while the creature stood with its fluffy legs separated and with a most comical cock to its head like a connoisseur sniffing the bouquet of a famous vintage
holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance fastened a stout cord to the mongrel's collar and led him to the foot of the water barrel
the creature instantly broke into a succession of high tremulous yelps and with his nose on the ground and his tail in the air pattered off upon the trail at a pace which strained his leash and kept us at the top of our speed
the east had been gradually whitening and we could now see some distance in the cold gray light
the square massive house with its black empty windows and high bare walls towered up sad and forlorn behind us
our course led right across the grounds in and out among the trenches and pits with which they were scarred and intersected
the whole place with its scattered dirt heaps and ill grown shrubs had a blighted ill omened look which harmonized with the black tragedy which hung over it
on reaching the boundary wall toby ran along whining eagerly underneath its shadow and stopped finally in a corner screened by a young beech
where the two walls joined several bricks had been loosened and the crevices left were worn down and rounded upon the lower side as though they had frequently been used as a ladder
holmes clambered up and taking the dog from me he dropped it over upon the other side
there's the print of wooden leg's hand he remarked as i mounted up beside him
you see the slight smudge of blood upon the white plaster
what a lucky thing it is that we have had no very heavy rain since yesterday
the scent will lie upon the road in spite of their eight and twenty hours' start
i confess that i had my doubts myself when i reflected upon the great traffic which had passed along the london road in the interval
my fears were soon appeased however
toby never hesitated or swerved but waddled on in his peculiar rolling fashion
clearly the pungent smell of the creasote rose high above all other contending scents
do not imagine said holmes that i depend for my success in this case upon the mere chance of one of these fellows having put his foot in the chemical
i have knowledge now which would enable me to trace them in many different ways
this however is the readiest and since fortune has put it into our hands i should be culpable if i neglected it
it has however prevented the case from becoming the pretty little intellectual problem which it at one time promised to be
there might have been some credit to be gained out of it but for this too palpable clue
there is credit and to spare said i
i assure you holmes that i marvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case even more than i did in the jefferson hope murder
the thing seems to me to be deeper and more inexplicable
how for example could you describe with such confidence the wooden legged man
pshaw my dear boy
it was simplicity itself
i don't wish to be theatrical
it is all patent and above board
two officers who are in command of a convict guard learn an important secret as to buried treasure
a map is drawn for them by an englishman named jonathan small
you remember that we saw the name upon the chart in captain morstan's possession
he had signed it in behalf of himself and his associates the sign of the four as he somewhat dramatically called it
aided by this chart the officers or one of them gets the treasure and brings it to england leaving we will suppose some condition under which he received it unfulfilled
now then why did not jonathan small get the treasure himself
the answer is obvious
the chart is dated at a time when morstan was brought into close association with convicts
jonathan small did not get the treasure because he and his associates were themselves convicts and could not get away
but that is mere speculation said i
it is more than that
it is the only hypothesis which covers the facts
let us see how it fits in with the sequel
major sholto remains at peace for some years happy in the possession of his treasure
then he receives a letter from india which gives him a great fright
what was that
a letter to say that the men whom he had wronged had been set free
or had escaped
that is much more likely for he would have known what their term of imprisonment was
it would not have been a surprise to him
what does he do then
he guards himself against a wooden legged man a white man mark you for he mistakes a white tradesman for him and actually fires a pistol at him
now only one white man's name is on the chart
the others are hindoos or mohammedans
there is no other white man
therefore we may say with confidence that the wooden legged man is identical with jonathan small
does the reasoning strike you as being faulty
no it is clear and concise
well now let us put ourselves in the place of jonathan small
let us look at it from his point of view
he comes to england with the double idea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and of having his revenge upon the man who had wronged him
he found out where sholto lived and very possibly he established communications with some one inside the house
there is this butler lal rao whom we have not seen
mrs
bernstone gives him far from a good character
small could not find out however where the treasure was hid for no one ever knew save the major and one faithful servant who had died
suddenly small learns that the major is on his death bed
in a frenzy lest the secret of the treasure die with him he runs the gauntlet of the guards makes his way to the dying man's window and is only deterred from entering by the presence of his two sons
mad with hate however against the dead man he enters the room that night searches his private papers in the hope of discovering some memorandum relating to the treasure and finally leaves a momento of his visit in the short inscription upon the card
he had doubtless planned beforehand that should he slay the major he would leave some such record upon the body as a sign that it was not a common murder but from the point of view of the four associates something in the nature of an act of justice
whimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind are common enough in the annals of crime and usually afford valuable indications as to the criminal
do you follow all this
very clearly
now what could jonathan small do
he could only continue to keep a secret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure
possibly he leaves england and only comes back at intervals
then comes the discovery of the garret and he is instantly informed of it
we again trace the presence of some confederate in the household
jonathan with his wooden leg is utterly unable to reach the lofty room of bartholomew sholto
he takes with him however a rather curious associate who gets over this difficulty but dips his naked foot into creasote whence comes toby and a six mile limp for a half pay officer with a damaged tendo achillis
but it was the associate and not jonathan who committed the crime
quite so
and rather to jonathan's disgust to judge by the way he stamped about when he got into the room
he bore no grudge against bartholomew sholto and would have preferred if he could have been simply bound and gagged
he did not wish to put his head in a halter
there was no help for it however the savage instincts of his companion had broken out and the poison had done its work so jonathan small left his record lowered the treasure box to the ground and followed it himself
that was the train of events as far as i can decipher them
of course as to his personal appearance he must be middle aged and must be sunburned after serving his time in such an oven as the andamans
his height is readily calculated from the length of his stride and we know that he was bearded
his hairiness was the one point which impressed itself upon thaddeus sholto when he saw him at the window
i don't know that there is anything else
the associate
ah well there is no great mystery in that
but you will know all about it soon enough
how sweet the morning air is
see how that one little cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo
now the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the london cloud bank
it shines on a good many folk but on none i dare bet who are on a stranger errand than you and i how small we feel with our petty ambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forces of nature
are you well up in your jean paul
fairly so
i worked back to him through carlyle
that was like following the brook to the parent lake
he makes one curious but profound remark
it is that the chief proof of man's real greatness lies in his perception of his own smallness
it argues you see a power of comparison and of appreciation which is in itself a proof of nobility
there is much food for thought in richter
you have not a pistol have you
i have my stick
it is just possible that we may need something of the sort if we get to their lair
jonathan i shall leave to you but if the other turns nasty i shall shoot him dead
he took out his revolver as he spoke and having loaded two of the chambers he put it back into the right hand pocket of his jacket
we had during this time been following the guidance of toby down the half rural villa lined roads which lead to the metropolis
now however we were beginning to come among continuous streets where laborers and dockmen were already astir and slatternly women were taking down shutters and brushing door steps
at the square topped corner public houses business was just beginning and rough looking men were emerging rubbing their sleeves across their beards after their morning wet
strange dogs sauntered up and stared wonderingly at us as we passed but our inimitable toby looked neither to the right nor to the left but trotted onwards with his nose to the ground and an occasional eager whine which spoke of a hot scent
we had traversed streatham brixton camberwell and now found ourselves in kennington lane having borne away through the side streets to the east of the oval
the men whom we pursued seemed to have taken a curiously zigzag road with the idea probably of escaping observation
they had never kept to the main road if a parallel side street would serve their turn
at the foot of kennington lane they had edged away to the left through bond street and miles street
where the latter street turns into knight's place toby ceased to advance but began to run backwards and forwards with one ear cocked and the other drooping the very picture of canine indecision
then he waddled round in circles looking up to us from time to time as if to ask for sympathy in his embarrassment
what the deuce is the matter with the dog
growled holmes
they surely would not take a cab or go off in a balloon
perhaps they stood here for some time i suggested
ah
it's all right
he's off again said my companion in a tone of relief
he was indeed off for after sniffing round again he suddenly made up his mind and darted away with an energy and determination such as he had not yet shown
the scent appeared to be much hotter than before for he had not even to put his nose on the ground but tugged at his leash and tried to break into a run
i cold see by the gleam in holmes's eyes that he thought we were nearing the end of our journey
our course now ran down nine elms until we came to broderick and nelson's large timber yard just past the white eagle tavern
here the dog frantic with excitement turned down through the side gate into the enclosure where the sawyers were already at work
on the dog raced through sawdust and shavings down an alley round a passage between two wood piles and finally with a triumphant yelp sprang upon a large barrel which still stood upon the hand trolley on which it had been brought
with lolling tongue and blinking eyes toby stood upon the cask looking from one to the other of us for some sign of appreciation
the staves of the barrel and the wheels of the trolley were smeared with a dark liquid and the whole air was heavy with the smell of creasote
sherlock holmes and i looked blankly at each other and then burst simultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter
what now
i asked
toby has lost his character for infallibility
he acted according to his lights said holmes lifting him down from the barrel and walking him out of the timber yard
if you consider how much creasote is carted about london in one day it is no great wonder that our trail should have been crossed
it is much used now especially for the seasoning of wood
poor toby is not to blame
we must get on the main scent again i suppose
yes
and fortunately we have no distance to go
evidently what puzzled the dog at the corner of knight's place was that there were two different trails running in opposite directions
we took the wrong one
it only remains to follow the other
there was no difficulty about this
on leading toby to the place where he had committed his fault he cast about in a wide circle and finally dashed off in a fresh direction
we must take care that he does not now bring us to the place where the creasote barrel came from i observed
i had thought of that
but you notice that he keeps on the pavement whereas the barrel passed down the roadway
no we are on the true scent now
it tended down towards the river side running through belmont place and prince's street
at the end of broad street it ran right down to the water's edge where there was a small wooden wharf
toby led us to the very edge of this and there stood whining looking out on the dark current beyond
we are out of luck said holmes
they have taken to a boat here
several small punts and skiffs were lying about in the water and on the edge of the wharf
we took toby round to each in turn but though he sniffed earnestly he made no sign
close to the rude landing stage was a small brick house with a wooden placard slung out through the second window
mordecai smith was printed across it in large letters and underneath boats to hire by the hour or day
a second inscription above the door informed us that a steam launch was kept a statement which was confirmed by a great pile of coke upon the jetty
sherlock holmes looked slowly round and his face assumed an ominous expression
this looks bad said he
these fellows are sharper than i expected
they seem to have covered their tracks
there has i fear been preconcerted management here
he was approaching the door of the house when it opened and a little curly headed lad of six came running out followed by a stoutish red faced woman with a large sponge in her hand
you come back and be washed jack she shouted
come back you young imp for if your father comes home and finds you like that he'll let us hear of it
dear little chap
said holmes strategically
what a rosy cheeked young rascal
now jack is there anything you would like
the youth pondered for a moment
i'd like a shillin' said he
nothing you would like better
i'd like two shillin' better the prodigy answered after some thought
here you are then
catch a fine child mrs
smith
lor' bless you sir he is that and forward
he gets a'most too much for me to manage 'specially when my man is away days at a time
away is he
said holmes in a disappointed voice
i am sorry for that for i wanted to speak to mr
smith
he's been away since yesterday mornin' sir and truth to tell i am beginnin' to feel frightened about him
but if it was about a boat sir maybe i could serve as well
i wanted to hire his steam launch
why bless you sir it is in the steam launch that he has gone
that's what puzzles me for i know there ain't more coals in her than would take her to about woolwich and back
if he'd been away in the barge i'd ha' thought nothin' for many a time a job has taken him as far as gravesend and then if there was much doin' there he might ha' stayed over
but what good is a steam launch without coals
he might have bought some at a wharf down the river
he might sir but it weren't his way
many a time i've heard him call out at the prices they charge for a few odd bags
besides i don't like that wooden legged man wi' his ugly face and outlandish talk
what did he want always knockin' about here for
a wooden legged man
said holmes with bland surprise
yes sir a brown monkey faced chap that's called more'n once for my old man
it was him that roused him up yesternight and what's more my man knew he was comin' for he had steam up in the launch
i tell you straight sir i don't feel easy in my mind about it
but my dear mrs
smith said holmes shrugging his shoulders you are frightening yourself about nothing
how could you possibly tell that it was the wooden legged man who came in the night
i don't quite understand how you can be so sure
his voice sir
i knew his voice which is kind o' thick and foggy
he tapped at the winder about three it would be
'show a leg matey ' says he 'time to turn out guard '
my old man woke up jim that's my eldest and away they went without so much as a word to me
i could hear the wooden leg clackin' on the stones
and was this wooden legged man alone
couldn't say i am sure sir
i didn't hear no one else
i am sorry mrs
smith for i wanted a steam launch and i have heard good reports of the let me see what is her name
the aurora sir
ah
she's not that old green launch with a yellow line very broad in the beam
no indeed
she's as trim a little thing as any on the river
she's been fresh painted black with two red streaks
thanks
i hope that you will hear soon from mr
smith
i am going down the river and if i should see anything of the aurora i shall let him know that you are uneasy
a black funnel you say
no sir
black with a white band
ah of course
it was the sides which were black
good morning mrs
smith there is a boatman here with a wherry watson
we shall take it and cross the river
the main thing with people of that sort said holmes as we sat in the sheets of the wherry is never to let them think that their information can be of the slightest importance to you
if you do they will instantly shut up like an oyster
if you listen to them under protest as it were you are very likely to get what you want
our course now seems pretty clear said i
what would you do then
i would engage a launch and go down the river on the track of the aurora
my dear fellow it would be a colossal task
she may have touched at any wharf on either side of the stream between here and greenwich
below the bridge there is a perfect labyrinth of landing places for miles
it would take you days and days to exhaust them if you set about it alone
employ the police then
no
i shall probably call athelney jones in at the last moment
he is not a bad fellow and i should not like to do anything which would injure him professionally
but i have a fancy for working it out myself now that we have gone so far
could we advertise then asking for information from wharfingers
worse and worse
our men would know that the chase was hot at their heels and they would be off out of the country
as it is they are likely enough to leave but as long as they think they are perfectly safe they will be in no hurry
jones's energy will be of use to us there for his view of the case is sure to push itself into the daily press and the runaways will think that every one is off on the wrong scent
what are we to do then
i asked as we landed near millbank penitentiary
take this hansom drive home have some breakfast and get an hour's sleep
it is quite on the cards that we may be afoot to night again
stop at a telegraph office cabby
we will keep toby for he may be of use to us yet
we pulled up at the great peter street post office and holmes despatched his wire
whom do you think that is to
he asked as we resumed our journey
i am sure i don't know
you remember the baker street division of the detective police force whom i employed in the jefferson hope case
well said i laughing
this is just the case where they might be invaluable
if they fail i have other resources but i shall try them first
that wire was to my dirty little lieutenant wiggins and i expect that he and his gang will be with us before we have finished our breakfast
it was between eight and nine o'clock now and i was conscious of a strong reaction after the successive excitements of the night
i was limp and weary befogged in mind and fatigued in body
i had not the professional enthusiasm which carried my companion on nor could i look at the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem
as far as the death of bartholomew sholto went i had heard little good of him and could feel no intense antipathy to his murderers
the treasure however was a different matter
that or part of it belonged rightfully to miss morstan
while there was a chance of recovering it i was ready to devote my life to the one object
true if i found it it would probably put her forever beyond my reach
yet it would be a petty and selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as that
if holmes could work to find the criminals i had a tenfold stronger reason to urge me on to find the treasure
a bath at baker street and a complete change freshened me up wonderfully
when i came down to our room i found the breakfast laid and homes pouring out the coffee
here it is said he laughing and pointing to an open newspaper
the energetic jones and the ubiquitous reporter have fixed it up between them
but you have had enough of the case
better have your ham and eggs first
i took the paper from him and read the short notice which was headed mysterious business at upper norwood
about twelve o'clock last night said the standard mr
bartholomew sholto of pondicherry lodge upper norwood was found dead in his room under circumstances which point to foul play
as far as we can learn no actual traces of violence were found upon mr
sholto's person but a valuable collection of indian gems which the deceased gentleman had inherited from his father has been carried off
the discovery was first made by mr
sherlock holmes and dr
watson who had called at the house with mr
thaddeus sholto brother of the deceased
by a singular piece of good fortune mr
athelney jones the well known member of the detective police force happened to be at the norwood police station and was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm
his trained and experienced faculties were at once directed towards the detection of the criminals with the gratifying result that the brother thaddeus sholto has already been arrested together with the housekeeper mrs
bernstone an indian butler named lal rao and a porter or gatekeeper named mcmurdo
it is quite certain that the thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house for mr
jones's well known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation have enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not have entered by the door or by the window but must have made their way across the roof of the building and so through a trap door into a room which communicated with that in which the body was found
this fact which has been very clearly made out proves conclusively that it was no mere haphazard burglary
the prompt and energetic action of the officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such occasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind
we cannot but think that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our detectives more decentralized and so brought into closer and more effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate
isn't it gorgeous
said holmes grinning over his coffee cup
what do you think of it
i think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrested for the crime
so do i i wouldn't answer for our safety now if he should happen to have another of his attacks of energy
at this moment there was a loud ring at the bell and i could hear mrs
hudson our landlady raising her voice in a wail of expostulation and dismay
by heaven holmes i said half rising i believe that they are really after us
no it's not quite so bad as that
it is the unofficial force the baker street irregulars
as he spoke there came a swift pattering of naked feet upon the stairs a clatter of high voices and in rushed a dozen dirty and ragged little street arabs
there was some show of discipline among them despite their tumultuous entry for they instantly drew up in line and stood facing us with expectant faces
one of their number taller and older than the others stood forward with an air of lounging superiority which was very funny in such a disreputable little scarecrow
got your message sir said he and brought 'em on sharp
three bob and a tanner for tickets
here you are said holmes producing some silver
in future they can report to you wiggins and you to me
i cannot have the house invaded in this way
however it is just as well that you should all hear the instructions
i want to find the whereabouts of a steam launch called the aurora owner mordecai smith black with two red streaks funnel black with a white band
she is down the river somewhere
i want one boy to be at mordecai smith's landing stage opposite millbank to say if the boat comes back
you must divide it out among yourselves and do both banks thoroughly
let me know the moment you have news
is that all clear
yes guv'nor said wiggins
the old scale of pay and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat
here's a day in advance
now off you go
he handed them a shilling each and away they buzzed down the stairs and i saw them a moment later streaming down the street
if the launch is above water they will find her said holmes as he rose from the table and lit his pipe
they can go everywhere see everything overhear every one
i expect to hear before evening that they have spotted her
in the mean while we can do nothing but await results
we cannot pick up the broken trail until we find either the aurora or mr
mordecai smith
toby could eat these scraps i dare say
are you going to bed holmes
no i am not tired
i have a curious constitution
i never remember feeling tired by work though idleness exhausts me completely
i am going to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fair client has introduced us
if ever man had an easy task this of ours ought to be
wooden legged men are not so common but the other man must i should think be absolutely unique
that other man again
i have no wish to make a mystery of him to you anyway
but you must have formed your own opinion
now do consider the data
diminutive footmarks toes never fettered by boots naked feet stone headed wooden mace great agility small poisoned darts
what do you make of all this
a savage
i exclaimed
perhaps one of those indians who were the associates of jonathan small
hardly that said he
when first i saw signs of strange weapons i was inclined to think so but the remarkable character of the footmarks caused me to reconsider my views
some of the inhabitants of the indian peninsula are small men but none could have left such marks as that
the hindoo proper has long and thin feet
the sandal wearing mohammedan has the great toe well separated from the others because the thong is commonly passed between
these little darts too could only be shot in one way
they are from a blow pipe
now then where are we to find our savage
south american i hazarded
he stretched his hand up and took down a bulky volume from the shelf
this is the first volume of a gazetteer which is now being published
it may be looked upon as the very latest authority
what have we here
'andaman islands situated miles to the north of sumatra in the bay of bengal '
hum
hum
what's all this
moist climate coral reefs sharks port blair convict barracks rutland island cottonwoods ah here we are
'the aborigines of the andaman islands may perhaps claim the distinction of being the smallest race upon this earth though some anthropologists prefer the bushmen of africa the digger indians of america and the terra del fuegians
the average height is rather below four feet although many full grown adults may be found who are very much smaller than this
they are a fierce morose and intractable people though capable of forming most devoted friendships when their confidence has once been gained '
mark that watson
now then listen to this
'they are naturally hideous having large misshapen heads small fierce eyes and distorted features
their feet and hands however are remarkably small
so intractable and fierce are they that all the efforts of the british official have failed to win them over in any degree
they have always been a terror to shipwrecked crews braining the survivors with their stone headed clubs or shooting them with their poisoned arrows
these massacres are invariably concluded by a cannibal feast '
nice amiable people watson
if this fellow had been left to his own unaided devices this affair might have taken an even more ghastly turn
i fancy that even as it is jonathan small would give a good deal not to have employed him
but how came he to have so singular a companion
ah that is more than i can tell
since however we had already determined that small had come from the andamans it is not so very wonderful that this islander should be with him
no doubt we shall know all about it in time
look here watson you look regularly done
lie down there on the sofa and see if i can put you to sleep
he took up his violin from the corner and as i stretched myself out he began to play some low dreamy melodious air his own no doubt for he had a remarkable gift for improvisation
i have a vague remembrance of his gaunt limbs his earnest face and the rise and fall of his bow
then i seemed to be floated peacefully away upon a soft sea of sound until i found myself in dream land with the sweet face of mary morstan looking down upon me
it was late in the afternoon before i woke strengthened and refreshed
sherlock holmes still sat exactly as i had left him save that he had laid aside his violin and was deep in a book
he looked across at me as i stirred and i noticed that his face was dark and troubled
you have slept soundly he said
i feared that our talk would wake you
i heard nothing i answered
have you had fresh news then
unfortunately no
i confess that i am surprised and disappointed
i expected something definite by this time
wiggins has just been up to report
he says that no trace can be found of the launch
it is a provoking check for every hour is of importance
can i do anything
i am perfectly fresh now and quite ready for another night's outing
no we can do nothing
we can only wait
if we go ourselves the message might come in our absence and delay be caused
you can do what you will but i must remain on guard
then i shall run over to camberwell and call upon mrs
cecil forrester
she asked me to yesterday
on mrs
cecil forrester
asked holmes with the twinkle of a smile in his eyes
well of course miss morstan too
they were anxious to hear what happened
i would not tell them too much said holmes
women are never to be entirely trusted not the best of them
i did not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment
i shall be back in an hour or two i remarked
all right
good luck
but i say if you are crossing the river you may as well return toby for i don't think it is at all likely that we shall have any use for him now
i took our mongrel accordingly and left him together with a half sovereign at the old naturalist's in pinchin lane
at camberwell i found miss morstan a little weary after her night's adventures but very eager to hear the news
mrs
forrester too was full of curiosity
i told them all that we had done suppressing however the more dreadful parts of the tragedy
thus although i spoke of mr
sholto's death i said nothing of the exact manner and method of it
with all my omissions however there was enough to startle and amaze them
it is a romance
cried mrs
forrester
an injured lady half a million in treasure a black cannibal and a wooden legged ruffian
they take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl
and two knight errants to the rescue added miss morstan with a bright glance at me
why mary your fortune depends upon the issue of this search
i don't think that you are nearly excited enough
just imagine what it must be to be so rich and to have the world at your feet
it sent a little thrill of joy to my heart to notice that she showed no sign of elation at the prospect
on the contrary she gave a toss of her proud head as though the matter were one in which she took small interest
it is for mr
thaddeus sholto that i am anxious she said
nothing else is of any consequence but i think that he has behaved most kindly and honorably throughout
it is our duty to clear him of this dreadful and unfounded charge
it was evening before i left camberwell and quite dark by the time i reached home
my companion's book and pipe lay by his chair but he had disappeared
i looked about in the hope of seeing a note but there was none
i suppose that mr
sherlock holmes has gone out i said to mrs
hudson as she came up to lower the blinds
no sir
he has gone to his room sir
do you know sir sinking her voice into an impressive whisper i am afraid for his health
why so mrs
hudson
well he's that strange sir
after you was gone he walked and he walked up and down and up and down until i was weary of the sound of his footstep
then i heard him talking to himself and muttering and every time the bell rang out he came on the stairhead with 'what is that mrs
hudson '
and now he has slammed off to his room but i can hear him walking away the same as ever
i hope he's not going to be ill sir
i ventured to say something to him about cooling medicine but he turned on me sir with such a look that i don't know how ever i got out of the room
i don't think that you have any cause to be uneasy mrs
hudson i answered
i have seen him like this before
he has some small matter upon his mind which makes him restless
i tried to speak lightly to our worthy landlady but i was myself somewhat uneasy when through the long night i still from time to time heard the dull sound of his tread and knew how his keen spirit was chafing against this involuntary inaction
at breakfast time he looked worn and haggard with a little fleck of feverish color upon either cheek
you are knocking yourself up old man i remarked
i heard you marching about in the night
no i could not sleep he answered
this infernal problem is consuming me
it is too much to be balked by so petty an obstacle when all else had been overcome
i know the men the launch everything and yet i can get no news
i have set other agencies at work and used every means at my disposal
the whole river has been searched on either side but there is no news nor has mrs
smith heard of her husband
i shall come to the conclusion soon that they have scuttled the craft
but there are objections to that
or that mrs
smith has put us on a wrong scent
no i think that may be dismissed
i had inquiries made and there is a launch of that description
could it have gone up the river
i have considered that possibility too and there is a search party who will work up as far as richmond
if no news comes to day i shall start off myself to morrow and go for the men rather than the boat
but surely surely we shall hear something
we did not however
not a word came to us either from wiggins or from the other agencies
there were articles in most of the papers upon the norwood tragedy
they all appeared to be rather hostile to the unfortunate thaddeus sholto
no fresh details were to be found however in any of them save that an inquest was to be held upon the following day
i walked over to camberwell in the evening to report our ill success to the ladies and on my return i found holmes dejected and somewhat morose
he would hardly reply to my questions and busied himself all evening in an abstruse chemical analysis which involved much heating of retorts and distilling of vapors ending at last in a smell which fairly drove me out of the apartment
up to the small hours of the morning i could hear the clinking of his test tubes which told me that he was still engaged in his malodorous experiment
in the early dawn i woke with a start and was surprised to find him standing by my bedside clad in a rude sailor dress with a pea jacket and a coarse red scarf round his neck
i am off down the river watson said he
i have been turning it over in my mind and i can see only one way out of it
it is worth trying at all events
surely i can come with you then
said i
no you can be much more useful if you will remain here as my representative
i am loath to go for it is quite on the cards that some message may come during the day though wiggins was despondent about it last night
i want you to open all notes and telegrams and to act on your own judgment if any news should come
can i rely upon you
most certainly
i am afraid that you will not be able to wire to me for i can hardly tell yet where i may find myself
if i am in luck however i may not be gone so very long
i shall have news of some sort or other before i get back
i had heard nothing of him by breakfast time
on opening the standard however i found that there was a fresh allusion to the business
with reference to the upper norwood tragedy it remarked we have reason to believe that the matter promises to be even more complex and mysterious than was originally supposed
fresh evidence has shown that it is quite impossible that mr
thaddeus sholto could have been in any way concerned in the matter
he and the housekeeper mrs
bernstone were both released yesterday evening
it is believed however that the police have a clue as to the real culprits and that it is being prosecuted by mr
athelney jones of scotland yard with all his well known energy and sagacity
further arrests may be expected at any moment
that is satisfactory so far as it goes thought i
friend sholto is safe at any rate
i wonder what the fresh clue may be though it seems to be a stereotyped form whenever the police have made a blunder
i tossed the paper down upon the table but at that moment my eye caught an advertisement in the agony column
it ran in this way lost whereas mordecai smith boatman and his son jim left smith's wharf at or about three o'clock last tuesday morning in the steam launch aurora black with two red stripes funnel black with a white band the sum of five pounds will be paid to any one who can give information to mrs
smith at smith's wharf or at 221b baker street as to the whereabouts of the said mordecai smith and the launch aurora
this was clearly holmes's doing
the baker street address was enough to prove that
it struck me as rather ingenious because it might be read by the fugitives without their seeing in it more than the natural anxiety of a wife for her missing husband
it was a long day
every time that a knock came to the door or a sharp step passed in the street i imagined that it was either holmes returning or an answer to his advertisement
i tried to read but my thoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill assorted and villainous pair whom we were pursuing
could there be i wondered some radical flaw in my companion's reasoning
might he be suffering from some huge self deception
was it not possible that his nimble and speculative mind had built up this wild theory upon faulty premises
i had never known him to be wrong and yet the keenest reasoner may occasionally be deceived
he was likely i thought to fall into error through the over refinement of his logic his preference for a subtle and bizarre explanation when a plainer and more commonplace one lay ready to his hand
yet on the other hand i had myself seen the evidence and i had heard the reasons for his deductions
when i looked back on the long chain of curious circumstances many of them trivial in themselves but all tending in the same direction i could not disguise from myself that even if holmes's explanation were incorrect the true theory must be equally outre and startling
at three o'clock in the afternoon there was a loud peal at the bell an authoritative voice in the hall and to my surprise no less a person than mr
athelney jones was shown up to me
very different was he however from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who had taken over the case so confidently at upper norwood
his expression was downcast and his bearing meek and even apologetic
good day sir good day said he
mr
sherlock holmes is out i understand
yes and i cannot be sure when he will be back
but perhaps you would care to wait
take that chair and try one of these cigars
thank you i don't mind if i do said he mopping his face with a red bandanna handkerchief
and a whiskey and soda
well half a glass
it is very hot for the time of year and i have had a good deal to worry and try me
you know my theory about this norwood case
i remember that you expressed one
well i have been obliged to reconsider it
i had my net drawn tightly round mr
sholto sir when pop he went through a hole in the middle of it
he was able to prove an alibi which could not be shaken
from the time that he left his brother's room he was never out of sight of some one or other
so it could not be he who climbed over roofs and through trap doors
it's a very dark case and my professional credit is at stake
i should be very glad of a little assistance
we all need help sometimes said i
your friend mr
sherlock holmes is a wonderful man sir said he in a husky and confidential voice
he's a man who is not to be beat
i have known that young man go into a good many cases but i never saw the case yet that he could not throw a light upon
he is irregular in his methods and a little quick perhaps in jumping at theories but on the whole i think he would have made a most promising officer and i don't care who knows it
i have had a wire from him this morning by which i understand that he has got some clue to this sholto business
here is the message
he took the telegram out of his pocket and handed it to me
it was dated from poplar at twelve o'clock
go to baker street at once it said
if i have not returned wait for me
i am close on the track of the sholto gang
you can come with us to night if you want to be in at the finish
this sounds well
he has evidently picked up the scent again said i
ah then he has been at fault too exclaimed jones with evident satisfaction
even the best of us are thrown off sometimes
of course this may prove to be a false alarm but it is my duty as an officer of the law to allow no chance to slip
but there is some one at the door
perhaps this is he
a heavy step was heard ascending the stair with a great wheezing and rattling as from a man who was sorely put to it for breath
once or twice he stopped as though the climb were too much for him but at last he made his way to our door and entered
his appearance corresponded to the sounds which we had heard
he was an aged man clad in seafaring garb with an old pea jacket buttoned up to his throat
his back was bowed his knees were shaky and his breathing was painfully asthmatic
as he leaned upon a thick oaken cudgel his shoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air into his lungs
he had a colored scarf round his chin and i could see little of his face save a pair of keen dark eyes overhung by bushy white brows and long gray side whiskers
altogether he gave me the impression of a respectable master mariner who had fallen into years and poverty
what is it my man
i asked
he looked about him in the slow methodical fashion of old age
is mr
sherlock holmes here
said he
no but i am acting for him
you can tell me any message you have for him
it was to him himself i was to tell it said he
but i tell you that i am acting for him
was it about mordecai smith's boat
yes
i knows well where it is
an' i knows where the men he is after are
an' i knows where the treasure is
i knows all about it
then tell me and i shall let him know
it was to him i was to tell it he repeated with the petulant obstinacy of a very old man
well you must wait for him
no no i ain't goin' to lose a whole day to please no one
if mr
holmes ain't here then mr
holmes must find it all out for himself
i don't care about the look of either of you and i won't tell a word
he shuffled towards the door but athelney jones got in front of him
wait a bit my friend said he
you have important information and you must not walk off
we shall keep you whether you like or not until our friend returns
the old man made a little run towards the door but as athelney jones put his broad back up against it he recognized the uselessness of resistance
pretty sort o' treatment this
he cried stamping his stick
i come here to see a gentleman and you two who i never saw in my life seize me and treat me in this fashion
you will be none the worse i said
we shall recompense you for the loss of your time
sit over here on the sofa and you will not have long to wait
he came across sullenly enough and seated himself with his face resting on his hands
jones and i resumed our cigars and our talk
suddenly however holmes's voice broke in upon us
i think that you might offer me a cigar too he said
we both started in our chairs
there was holmes sitting close to us with an air of quiet amusement
holmes
i exclaimed
you here
but where is the old man
here is the old man said he holding out a heap of white hair
here he is wig whiskers eyebrows and all
i thought my disguise was pretty good but i hardly expected that it would stand that test
ah you rogue
cried jones highly delighted
you would have made an actor and a rare one
you had the proper workhouse cough and those weak legs of yours are worth ten pound a week
i thought i knew the glint of your eye though
you didn't get away from us so easily you see
i have been working in that get up all day said he lighting his cigar
you see a good many of the criminal classes begin to know me especially since our friend here took to publishing some of my cases so i can only go on the war path under some simple disguise like this
you got my wire
yes that was what brought me here
how has your case prospered
it has all come to nothing
i have had to release two of my prisoners and there is no evidence against the other two
never mind
we shall give you two others in the place of them
but you must put yourself under my orders
you are welcome to all the official credit but you must act on the line that i point out
is that agreed
entirely if you will help me to the men
well then in the first place i shall want a fast police boat a steam launch to be at the westminster stairs at seven o'clock
that is easily managed
there is always one about there but i can step across the road and telephone to make sure
then i shall want two stanch men in case of resistance
there will be two or three in the boat
what else
when we secure the men we shall get the treasure
i think that it would be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to the young lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs
let her be the first to open it eh watson
it would be a great pleasure to me
rather an irregular proceeding said jones shaking his head
however the whole thing is irregular and i suppose we must wink at it
the treasure must afterwards be handed over to the authorities until after the official investigation
certainly
that is easily managed
one other point
i should much like to have a few details about this matter from the lips of jonathan small himself
you know i like to work the detail of my cases out
there is no objection to my having an unofficial interview with him either here in my rooms or elsewhere as long as he is efficiently guarded
well you are master of the situation
i have had no proof yet of the existence of this jonathan small
however if you can catch him i don't see how i can refuse you an interview with him
that is understood then
perfectly
is there anything else
only that i insist upon your dining with us
it will be ready in half an hour
i have oysters and a brace of grouse with something a little choice in white wines watson you have never yet recognized my merits as a housekeeper
our meal was a merry one
holmes could talk exceedingly well when he chose and that night he did choose
he appeared to be in a state of nervous exaltation
i have never known him so brilliant
he spoke on a quick succession of subjects on miracle plays on medieval pottery on stradivarius violins on the buddhism of ceylon and on the war ships of the future handling each as though he had made a special study of it
his bright humor marked the reaction from his black depression of the preceding days
athelney jones proved to be a sociable soul in his hours of relaxation and faced his dinner with the air of a bon vivant
for myself i felt elated at the thought that we were nearing the end of our task and i caught something of holmes's gaiety
none of us alluded during dinner to the cause which had brought us together
when the cloth was cleared holmes glanced at his watch and filled up three glasses with port
one bumper said he to the success of our little expedition
and now it is high time we were off
have you a pistol watson
i have my old service revolver in my desk
you had best take it then
it is well to be prepared
i see that the cab is at the door
i ordered it for half past six
it was a little past seven before we reached the westminster wharf and found our launch awaiting us
holmes eyed it critically
is there anything to mark it as a police boat
yes that green lamp at the side
then take it off
the small change was made we stepped on board and the ropes were cast off
jones holmes and i sat in the stern
there was one man at the rudder one to tend the engines and two burly police inspectors forward
where to
asked jones
to the tower
tell them to stop opposite jacobson's yard
our craft was evidently a very fast one
we shot past the long lines of loaded barges as though they were stationary
holmes smiled with satisfaction as we overhauled a river steamer and left her behind us
we ought to be able to catch anything on the river he said
well hardly that
but there are not many launches to beat us
we shall have to catch the aurora and she has a name for being a clipper
i will tell you how the land lies watson
you recollect how annoyed i was at being balked by so small a thing
yes
well i gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical analysis
one of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work is the best rest
so it is
when i had succeeded in dissolving the hydrocarbon which i was at work at i came back to our problem of the sholtos and thought the whole matter out again
my boys had been up the river and down the river without result
the launch was not at any landing stage or wharf nor had it returned
yet it could hardly have been scuttled to hide their traces though that always remained as a possible hypothesis if all else failed
i knew this man small had a certain degree of low cunning but i did not think him capable of anything in the nature of delicate finesse
that is usually a product of higher education
i then reflected that since he had certainly been in london some time as we had evidence that he maintained a continual watch over pondicherry lodge he could hardly leave at a moment's notice but would need some little time if it were only a day to arrange his affairs
that was the balance of probability at any rate
it seems to me to be a little weak said i
it is more probable that he had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon his expedition
no i hardly think so
this lair of his would be too valuable a retreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he could do without it
but a second consideration struck me
jonathan small must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion however much he may have top coated him would give rise to gossip and possibly be associated with this norwood tragedy
he was quite sharp enough to see that
they had started from their head quarters under cover of darkness and he would wish to get back before it was broad light
now it was past three o'clock according to mrs
smith when they got the boat
it would be quite bright and people would be about in an hour or so
therefore i argued they did not go very far
they paid smith well to hold his tongue reserved his launch for the final escape and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure box
in a couple of nights when they had time to see what view the papers took and whether there was any suspicion they would make their way under cover of darkness to some ship at gravesend or in the downs where no doubt they had already arranged for passages to america or the colonies
but the launch
they could not have taken that to their lodgings
quite so
i argued that the launch must be no great way off in spite of its invisibility
i then put myself in the place of small and looked at it as a man of his capacity would
he would probably consider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track
how then could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted
i wondered what i should do myself if i were in his shoes
i could only think of one way of doing it
i might land the launch over to some boat builder or repairer with directions to make a trifling change in her
she would then be removed to his shed or yard and so be effectually concealed while at the same time i could have her at a few hours' notice
that seems simple enough
it is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to be overlooked
however i determined to act on the idea
i started at once in this harmless seaman's rig and inquired at all the yards down the river
i drew blank at fifteen but at the sixteenth jacobson's i learned that the aurora had been handed over to them two days ago by a wooden legged man with some trivial directions as to her rudder
'there ain't naught amiss with her rudder ' said the foreman
'there she lies with the red streaks '
at that moment who should come down but mordecai smith the missing owner
he was rather the worse for liquor
i should not of course have known him but he bellowed out his name and the name of his launch
'i want her to night at eight o'clock ' said he 'eight o'clock sharp mind for i have two gentlemen who won't be kept waiting '
they had evidently paid him well for he was very flush of money chucking shillings about to the men
i followed him some distance but he subsided into an ale house so i went back to the yard and happening to pick up one of my boys on the way i stationed him as a sentry over the launch
he is to stand at water's edge and wave his handkerchief to us when they start
we shall be lying off in the stream and it will be a strange thing if we do not take men treasure and all
you have planned it all very neatly whether they are the right men or not said jones but if the affair were in my hands i should have had a body of police in jacobson's yard and arrested them when they came down
which would have been never
this man small is a pretty shrewd fellow
he would send a scout on ahead and if anything made him suspicious lie snug for another week
but you might have stuck to mordecai smith and so been led to their hiding place said i
in that case i should have wasted my day
i think that it is a hundred to one against smith knowing where they live
as long as he has liquor and good pay why should he ask questions
they send him messages what to do
no i thought over every possible course and this is the best
while this conversation had been proceeding we had been shooting the long series of bridges which span the thames
as we passed the city the last rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon the summit of st
paul's
it was twilight before we reached the tower
that is jacobson's yard said holmes pointing to a bristle of masts and rigging on the surrey side
cruise gently up and down here under cover of this string of lighters
he took a pair of night glasses from his pocket and gazed some time at the shore
i see my sentry at his post he remarked but no sign of a handkerchief
suppose we go down stream a short way and lie in wait for them said jones eagerly
we were all eager by this time even the policemen and stokers who had a very vague idea of what was going forward
we have no right to take anything for granted holmes answered
it is certainly ten to one that they go down stream but we cannot be certain
from this point we can see the entrance of the yard and they can hardly see us
it will be a clear night and plenty of light
we must stay where we are
see how the folk swarm over yonder in the gaslight
they are coming from work in the yard
dirty looking rascals but i suppose every one has some little immortal spark concealed about him
you would not think it to look at them
there is no a priori probability about it
a strange enigma is man
some one calls him a soul concealed in an animal i suggested
winwood reade is good upon the subject said holmes
he remarks that while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle in the aggregate he becomes a mathematical certainty
you can for example never foretell what any one man will do but you can say with precision what an average number will be up to
individuals vary but percentages remain constant
so says the statistician
but do i see a handkerchief
surely there is a white flutter over yonder
yes it is your boy i cried
i can see him plainly
and there is the aurora exclaimed holmes and going like the devil
full speed ahead engineer
make after that launch with the yellow light
by heaven i shall never forgive myself if she proves to have the heels of us
she had slipped unseen through the yard entrance and passed behind two or three small craft so that she had fairly got her speed up before we saw her
now she was flying down the stream near in to the shore going at a tremendous rate
jones looked gravely at her and shook his head
she is very fast he said
i doubt if we shall catch her
we must catch her
cried holmes between his teeth
heap it on stokers
make her do all she can
if we burn the boat we must have them
we were fairly after her now
the furnaces roared and the powerful engines whizzed and clanked like a great metallic heart
her sharp steep prow cut through the river water and sent two rolling waves to right and to left of us
with every throb of the engines we sprang and quivered like a living thing
one great yellow lantern in our bows threw a long flickering funnel of light in front of us
right ahead a dark blur upon the water showed where the aurora lay and the swirl of white foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she was going
we flashed past barges steamers merchant vessels in and out behind this one and round the other
voices hailed us out of the darkness but still the aurora thundered on and still we followed close upon her track
pile it on men pile it on
cried holmes looking down into the engine room while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager aquiline face
get every pound of steam you can
i think we gain a little said jones with his eyes on the aurora
i am sure of it said i
we shall be up with her in a very few minutes
at that moment however as our evil fate would have it a tug with three barges in tow blundered in between us
it was only by putting our helm hard down that we avoided a collision and before we could round them and recover our way the aurora had gained a good two hundred yards
she was still however well in view and the murky uncertain twilight was setting into a clear starlit night
our boilers were strained to their utmost and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with the fierce energy which was driving us along
we had shot through the pool past the west india docks down the long deptford reach and up again after rounding the isle of dogs
the dull blur in front of us resolved itself now clearly enough into the dainty aurora
jones turned our search light upon her so that we could plainly see the figures upon her deck
one man sat by the stern with something black between his knees over which he stooped
beside him lay a dark mass which looked like a newfoundland dog
the boy held the tiller while against the red glare of the furnace i could see old smith stripped to the waist and shovelling coals for dear life
they may have had some doubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them but now as we followed every winding and turning which they took there could no longer be any question about it
at greenwich we were about three hundred paces behind them
at blackwall we could not have been more than two hundred and fifty
i have coursed many creatures in many countries during my checkered career but never did sport give me such a wild thrill as this mad flying man hunt down the thames
steadily we drew in upon them yard by yard
in the silence of the night we could hear the panting and clanking of their machinery
the man in the stern still crouched upon the deck and his arms were moving as though he were busy while every now and then he would look up and measure with a glance the distance which still separated us
nearer we came and nearer
jones yelled to them to stop
we were not more than four boat's lengths behind them both boats flying at a tremendous pace
it was a clear reach of the river with barking level upon one side and the melancholy plumstead marshes upon the other
at our hail the man in the stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clinched fists at us cursing the while in a high cracked voice
he was a good sized powerful man and as he stood poising himself with legs astride i could see that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump upon the right side
at the sound of his strident angry cries there was movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck
it straightened itself into a little black man the smallest i have ever seen with a great misshapen head and a shock of tangled dishevelled hair
holmes had already drawn his revolver and i whipped out mine at the sight of this savage distorted creature
he was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster or blanket which left only his face exposed but that face was enough to give a man a sleepless night
never have i seen features so deeply marked with all bestiality and cruelty
his small eyes glowed and burned with a sombre light and his thick lips were writhed back from his teeth which grinned and chattered at us with a half animal fury
fire if he raises his hand said holmes quietly
we were within a boat's length by this time and almost within touch of our quarry
i can see the two of them now as they stood the white man with his legs far apart shrieking out curses and the unhallowed dwarf with his hideous face and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light of our lantern
it was well that we had so clear a view of him
even as we looked he plucked out from under his covering a short round piece of wood like a school ruler and clapped it to his lips
our pistols rang out together
he whirled round threw up his arms and with a kind of choking cough fell sideways into the stream
i caught one glimpse of his venomous menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters
at the same moment the wooden legged man threw himself upon the rudder and put it hard down so that his boat made straight in for the southern bank while we shot past her stern only clearing her by a few feet
we were round after her in an instant but she was already nearly at the bank
it was a wild and desolate place where the moon glimmered upon a wide expanse of marsh land with pools of stagnant water and beds of decaying vegetation
the launch with a dull thud ran up upon the mud bank with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water
the fugitive sprang out but his stump instantly sank its whole length into the sodden soil
in vain he struggled and writhed
not one step could he possibly take either forwards or backwards
he yelled in impotent rage and kicked frantically into the mud with his other foot but his struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky bank
when we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchored that it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders that we were able to haul him out and to drag him like some evil fish over our side
the two smiths father and son sat sullenly in their launch but came aboard meekly enough when commanded
the aurora herself we hauled off and made fast to our stern
a solid iron chest of indian workmanship stood upon the deck
this there could be no question was the same that had contained the ill omened treasure of the sholtos
there was no key but it was of considerable weight so we transferred it carefully to our own little cabin
as we steamed slowly up stream again we flashed our search light in every direction but there was no sign of the islander
somewhere in the dark ooze at the bottom of the thames lie the bones of that strange visitor to our shores
see here said holmes pointing to the wooden hatchway
we were hardly quick enough with our pistols
there sure enough just behind where we had been standing stuck one of those murderous darts which we knew so well
it must have whizzed between us at the instant that we fired
holmes smiled at it and shrugged his shoulders in his easy fashion but i confess that it turned me sick to think of the horrible death which had passed so close to us that night
our captive sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he had done so much and waited so long to gain
he was a sunburned reckless eyed fellow with a net work of lines and wrinkles all over his mahogany features which told of a hard open air life
there was a singular prominence about his bearded chin which marked a man who was not to be easily turned from his purpose
his age may have been fifty or thereabouts for his black curly hair was thickly shot with gray
his face in repose was not an unpleasing one though his heavy brows and aggressive chin gave him as i had lately seen a terrible expression when moved to anger
he sat now with his handcuffed hands upon his lap and his head sunk upon his breast while he looked with his keen twinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his ill doings
it seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in his rigid and contained countenance
once he looked up at me with a gleam of something like humor in his eyes
well jonathan small said holmes lighting a cigar i am sorry that it has come to this
and so am i sir he answered frankly
i don't believe that i can swing over the job
i give you my word on the book that i never raised hand against mr
sholto
it was that little hell hound tonga who shot one of his cursed darts into him
i had no part in it sir
i was as grieved as if it had been my blood relation
i welted the little devil with the slack end of the rope for it but it was done and i could not undo it again
have a cigar said holmes and you had best take a pull out of my flask for you are very wet
how could you expect so small and weak a man as this black fellow to overpower mr
sholto and hold him while you were climbing the rope
you seem to know as much about it as if you were there sir
the truth is that i hoped to find the room clear
i knew the habits of the house pretty well and it was the time when mr
sholto usually went down to his supper
i shall make no secret of the business
the best defence that i can make is just the simple truth
now if it had been the old major i would have swung for him with a light heart
i would have thought no more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar
but it's cursed hard that i should be lagged over this young sholto with whom i had no quarrel whatever
you are under the charge of mr
athelney jones of scotland yard
he is going to bring you up to my rooms and i shall ask you for a true account of the matter
you must make a clean breast of it for if you do i hope that i may be of use to you
i think i can prove that the poison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached the room
that he was sir
i never got such a turn in my life as when i saw him grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as i climbed through the window
it fairly shook me sir
i'd have half killed tonga for it if he had not scrambled off
that was how he came to leave his club and some of his darts too as he tells me which i dare say helped to put you on our track though how you kept on it is more than i can tell
i don't feel no malice against you for it
but it does seem a queer thing he added with a bitter smile that i who have a fair claim to nigh upon half a million of money should spend the first half of my life building a breakwater in the andamans and am like to spend the other half digging drains at dartmoor
it was an evil day for me when first i clapped eyes upon the merchant achmet and had to do with the agra treasure which never brought anything but a curse yet upon the man who owned it
to him it brought murder to major sholto it brought fear and guilt to me it has meant slavery for life
at this moment athelney jones thrust his broad face and heavy shoulders into the tiny cabin
quite a family party he remarked
i think i shall have a pull at that flask holmes
well i think we may all congratulate each other
pity we didn't take the other alive but there was no choice
i say holmes you must confess that you cut it rather fine
it was all we could do to overhaul her
all is well that ends well said holmes
but i certainly did not know that the aurora was such a clipper
smith says she is one of the fastest launches on the river and that if he had had another man to help him with the engines we should never have caught her
he swears he knew nothing of this norwood business
neither he did cried our prisoner not a word
i chose his launch because i heard that she was a flier
we told him nothing but we paid him well and he was to get something handsome if we reached our vessel the esmeralda at gravesend outward bound for the brazils
well if he has done no wrong we shall see that no wrong comes to him
if we are pretty quick in catching our men we are not so quick in condemning them
it was amusing to notice how the consequential jones was already beginning to give himself airs on the strength of the capture
from the slight smile which played over sherlock holmes's face i could see that the speech had not been lost upon him
we will be at vauxhall bridge presently said jones and shall land you dr
watson with the treasure box
i need hardly tell you that i am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this
it is most irregular but of course an agreement is an agreement
i must however as a matter of duty send an inspector with you since you have so valuable a charge
you will drive no doubt
yes i shall drive
it is a pity there is no key that we may make an inventory first
you will have to break it open
where is the key my man
at the bottom of the river said small shortly
hum
there was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble
we have had work enough already through you
however doctor i need not warn you to be careful
bring the box back with you to the baker street rooms
you will find us there on our way to the station
they landed me at vauxhall with my heavy iron box and with a bluff genial inspector as my companion
a quarter of an hour's drive brought us to mrs
cecil forrester's
the servant seemed surprised at so late a visitor
mrs
cecil forrester was out for the evening she explained and likely to be very late
miss morstan however was in the drawing room so to the drawing room i went box in hand leaving the obliging inspector in the cab
she was seated by the open window dressed in some sort of white diaphanous material with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and waist
the soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned back in the basket chair playing over her sweet grave face and tinting with a dull metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant hair
one white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair and her whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy
at the sound of my foot fall she sprang to her feet however and a bright flush of surprise and of pleasure colored her pale cheeks
i heard a cab drive up she said
i thought that mrs
forrester had come back very early but i never dreamed that it might be you
what news have you brought me
i have brought something better than news said i putting down the box upon the table and speaking jovially and boisterously though my heart was heavy within me
i have brought you something which is worth all the news in the world
i have brought you a fortune
she glanced at the iron box
is that the treasure then
she asked coolly enough
yes this is the great agra treasure
half of it is yours and half is thaddeus sholto's
you will have a couple of hundred thousand each
think of that
an annuity of ten thousand pounds
there will be few richer young ladies in england
is it not glorious
i think that i must have been rather overacting my delight and that she detected a hollow ring in my congratulations for i saw her eyebrows rise a little and she glanced at me curiously
if i have it said she i owe it to you
no no i answered not to me but to my friend sherlock holmes
with all the will in the world i could never have followed up a clue which has taxed even his analytical genius
as it was we very nearly lost it at the last moment
pray sit down and tell me all about it dr
watson said she
i narrated briefly what had occurred since i had seen her last holmes's new method of search the discovery of the aurora the appearance of athelney jones our expedition in the evening and the wild chase down the thames
she listened with parted lips and shining eyes to my recital of our adventures
when i spoke of the dart which had so narrowly missed us she turned so white that i feared that she was about to faint
it is nothing she said as i hastened to pour her out some water
i am all right again
it was a shock to me to hear that i had placed my friends in such horrible peril
that is all over i answered
it was nothing
i will tell you no more gloomy details
let us turn to something brighter
there is the treasure
what could be brighter than that
i got leave to bring it with me thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see it
it would be of the greatest interest to me she said
there was no eagerness in her voice however
it had struck her doubtless that it might seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize which had cost so much to win
what a pretty box
she said stooping over it
this is indian work i suppose
yes it is benares metal work
and so heavy
she exclaimed trying to raise it
the box alone must be of some value
where is the key
small threw it into the thames i answered
i must borrow mrs
forrester's poker
there was in the front a thick and broad hasp wrought in the image of a sitting buddha
under this i thrust the end of the poker and twisted it outward as a lever
the hasp sprang open with a loud snap
with trembling fingers i flung back the lid
we both stood gazing in astonishment
the box was empty
no wonder that it was heavy
the iron work was two thirds of an inch thick all round
it was massive well made and solid like a chest constructed to carry things of great price but not one shred or crumb of metal or jewelry lay within it
it was absolutely and completely empty
the treasure is lost said miss morstan calmly
as i listened to the words and realized what they meant a great shadow seemed to pass from my soul
i did not know how this agra treasure had weighed me down until now that it was finally removed
it was selfish no doubt disloyal wrong but i could realize nothing save that the golden barrier was gone from between us
thank god
i ejaculated from my very heart
she looked at me with a quick questioning smile
why do you say that
she asked
because you are within my reach again i said taking her hand
she did not withdraw it
because i love you mary as truly as ever a man loved a woman
because this treasure these riches sealed my lips
now that they are gone i can tell you how i love you
that is why i said 'thank god '
then i say 'thank god ' too she whispered as i drew her to my side
whoever had lost a treasure i knew that night that i had gained one
a very patient man was that inspector in the cab for it was a weary time before i rejoined him
his face clouded over when i showed him the empty box
there goes the reward
said he gloomily
where there is no money there is no pay
this night's work would have been worth a tenner each to sam brown and me if the treasure had been there
mr
thaddeus sholto is a rich man i said
he will see that you are rewarded treasure or no
the inspector shook his head despondently however
it's a bad job he repeated and so mr
athelney jones will think
his forecast proved to be correct for the detective looked blank enough when i got to baker street and showed him the empty box
they had only just arrived holmes the prisoner and he for they had changed their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon the way
my companion lounged in his arm chair with his usual listless expression while small sat stolidly opposite to him with his wooden leg cocked over his sound one
as i exhibited the empty box he leaned back in his chair and laughed aloud
this is your doing small said athelney jones angrily
yes i have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it he cried exultantly
it is my treasure and if i can't have the loot i'll take darned good care that no one else does
i tell you that no living man has any right to it unless it is three men who are in the andaman convict barracks and myself
i know now that i cannot have the use of it and i know that they cannot
i have acted all through for them as much as for myself
it's been the sign of four with us always
well i know that they would have had me do just what i have done and throw the treasure into the thames rather than let it go to kith or kin of sholto or of morstan
it was not to make them rich that we did for achmet
you'll find the treasure where the key is and where little tonga is
when i saw that your launch must catch us i put the loot away in a safe place
there are no rupees for you this journey
you are deceiving us small said athelney jones sternly
if you had wished to throw the treasure into the thames it would have been easier for you to have thrown box and all
easier for me to throw and easier for you to recover he answered with a shrewd sidelong look
the man that was clever enough to hunt me down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a river
now that they are scattered over five miles or so it may be a harder job
it went to my heart to do it though
i was half mad when you came up with us
however there's no good grieving over it
i've had ups in my life and i've had downs but i've learned not to cry over spilled milk
this is a very serious matter small said the detective
if you had helped justice instead of thwarting it in this way you would have had a better chance at your trial
justice
snarled the ex convict
a pretty justice
whose loot is this if it is not ours
where is the justice that i should give it up to those who have never earned it
look how i have earned it
twenty long years in that fever ridden swamp all day at work under the mangrove tree all night chained up in the filthy convict huts bitten by mosquitoes racked with ague bullied by every cursed black faced policeman who loved to take it out of a white man
that was how i earned the agra treasure and you talk to me of justice because i cannot bear to feel that i have paid this price only that another may enjoy it
i would rather swing a score of times or have one of tonga's darts in my hide than live in a convict's cell and feel that another man is at his ease in a palace with the money that should be mine
small had dropped his mask of stoicism and all this came out in a wild whirl of words while his eyes blazed and the handcuffs clanked together with the impassioned movement of his hands
i could understand as i saw the fury and the passion of the man that it was no groundless or unnatural terror which had possessed major sholto when he first learned that the injured convict was upon his track
you forget that we know nothing of all this said holmes quietly
we have not heard your story and we cannot tell how far justice may originally have been on your side
well sir you have been very fair spoken to me though i can see that i have you to thank that i have these bracelets upon my wrists
still i bear no grudge for that
it is all fair and above board
if you want to hear my story i have no wish to hold it back
what i say to you is god's truth every word of it
thank you you can put the glass beside me here and i'll put my lips to it if i am dry
i am a worcestershire man myself born near pershore
i dare say you would find a heap of smalls living there now if you were to look
i have often thought of taking a look round there but the truth is that i was never much of a credit to the family and i doubt if they would be so very glad to see me
they were all steady chapel going folk small farmers well known and respected over the country side while i was always a bit of a rover
at last however when i was about eighteen i gave them no more trouble for i got into a mess over a girl and could only get out of it again by taking the queen's shilling and joining the 3d buffs which was just starting for india
i wasn't destined to do much soldiering however
i had just got past the goose step and learned to handle my musket when i was fool enough to go swimming in the ganges
luckily for me my company sergeant john holder was in the water at the same time and he was one of the finest swimmers in the service
a crocodile took me just as i was half way across and nipped off my right leg as clean as a surgeon could have done it just above the knee
what with the shock and the loss of blood i fainted and should have drowned if holder had not caught hold of me and paddled for the bank
i was five months in hospital over it and when at last i was able to limp out of it with this timber toe strapped to my stump i found myself invalided out of the army and unfitted for any active occupation
i was as you can imagine pretty down on my luck at this time for i was a useless cripple though not yet in my twentieth year
however my misfortune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise
a man named abelwhite who had come out there as an indigo planter wanted an overseer to look after his coolies and keep them up to their work
he happened to be a friend of our colonel's who had taken an interest in me since the accident
to make a long story short the colonel recommended me strongly for the post and as the work was mostly to be done on horseback my leg was no great obstacle for i had enough knee left to keep good grip on the saddle
what i had to do was to ride over the plantation to keep an eye on the men as they worked and to report the idlers
the pay was fair i had comfortable quarters and altogether i was content to spend the remainder of my life in indigo planting
mr
abelwhite was a kind man and he would often drop into my little shanty and smoke a pipe with me for white folk out there feel their hearts warm to each other as they never do here at home
well i was never in luck's way long
suddenly without a note of warning the great mutiny broke upon us
one month india lay as still and peaceful to all appearance as surrey or kent the next there were two hundred thousand black devils let loose and the country was a perfect hell
of course you know all about it gentlemen a deal more than i do very like since reading is not in my line
i only know what i saw with my own eyes
our plantation was at a place called muttra near the border of the northwest provinces
night after night the whole sky was alight with the burning bungalows and day after day we had small companies of europeans passing through our estate with their wives and children on their way to agra where were the nearest troops
mr
abelwhite was an obstinate man
he had it in his head that the affair had been exaggerated and that it would blow over as suddenly as it had sprung up
there he sat on his veranda drinking whiskey pegs and smoking cheroots while the country was in a blaze about him
of course we stuck by him i and dawson who with his wife used to do the book work and the managing
well one fine day the crash came
i had been away on a distant plantation and was riding slowly home in the evening when my eye fell upon something all huddled together at the bottom of a steep nullah
i rode down to see what it was and the cold struck through my heart when i found it was dawson's wife all cut into ribbons and half eaten by jackals and native dogs
a little further up the road dawson himself was lying on his face quite dead with an empty revolver in his hand and four sepoys lying across each other in front of him
i reined up my horse wondering which way i should turn but at that moment i saw thick smoke curling up from abelwhite's bungalow and the flames beginning to burst through the roof
i knew then that i could do my employer no good but would only throw my own life away if i meddled in the matter
from where i stood i could see hundreds of the black fiends with their red coats still on their backs dancing and howling round the burning house
some of them pointed at me and a couple of bullets sang past my head so i broke away across the paddy fields and found myself late at night safe within the walls at agra
as it proved however there was no great safety there either
the whole country was up like a swarm of bees
wherever the english could collect in little bands they held just the ground that their guns commanded
everywhere else they were helpless fugitives
it was a fight of the millions against the hundreds and the cruellest part of it was that these men that we fought against foot horse and gunners were our own picked troops whom we had taught and trained handling our own weapons and blowing our own bugle calls
at agra there were the 3d bengal fusiliers some sikhs two troops of horse and a battery of artillery
a volunteer corps of clerks and merchants had been formed and this i joined wooden leg and all
we went out to meet the rebels at shahgunge early in july and we beat them back for a time but our powder gave out and we had to fall back upon the city
nothing but the worst news came to us from every side which is not to be wondered at for if you look at the map you will see that we were right in the heart of it
lucknow is rather better than a hundred miles to the east and cawnpore about as far to the south
from every point on the compass there was nothing but torture and murder and outrage
the city of agra is a great place swarming with fanatics and fierce devil worshippers of all sorts
our handful of men were lost among the narrow winding streets
our leader moved across the river therefore and took up his position in the old fort at agra
i don't know if any of you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of that old fort
it is a very queer place the queerest that ever i was in and i have been in some rum corners too
first of all it is enormous in size
i should think that the enclosure must be acres and acres
there is a modern part which took all our garrison women children stores and everything else with plenty of room over
but the modern part is nothing like the size of the old quarter where nobody goes and which is given over to the scorpions and the centipedes
it is all full of great deserted halls and winding passages and long corridors twisting in and out so that it is easy enough for folk to get lost in it
for this reason it was seldom that any one went into it though now and again a party with torches might go exploring
the river washes along the front of the old fort and so protects it but on the sides and behind there are many doors and these had to be guarded of course in the old quarter as well as in that which was actually held by our troops
we were short handed with hardly men enough to man the angles of the building and to serve the guns
it was impossible for us therefore to station a strong guard at every one of the innumerable gates
what we did was to organize a central guard house in the middle of the fort and to leave each gate under the charge of one white man and two or three natives
i was selected to take charge during certain hours of the night of a small isolated door upon the southwest side of the building
two sikh troopers were placed under my command and i was instructed if anything went wrong to fire my musket when i might rely upon help coming at once from the central guard
as the guard was a good two hundred paces away however and as the space between was cut up into a labyrinth of passages and corridors i had great doubts as to whether they could arrive in time to be of any use in case of an actual attack
well i was pretty proud at having this small command given me since i was a raw recruit and a game legged one at that
for two nights i kept the watch with my punjaubees
they were tall fierce looking chaps mahomet singh and abdullah khan by name both old fighting men who had borne arms against us at chilian wallah
they could talk english pretty well but i could get little out of them
they preferred to stand together and jabber all night in their queer sikh lingo
for myself i used to stand outside the gate way looking down on the broad winding river and on the twinkling lights of the great city
the beating of drums the rattle of tomtoms and the yells and howls of the rebels drunk with opium and with bang were enough to remind us all night of our dangerous neighbors across the stream
every two hours the officer of the night used to come round to all the posts to make sure that all was well
the third night of my watch was dark and dirty with a small driving rain
it was dreary work standing in the gate way hour after hour in such weather
i tried again and again to make my sikhs talk but without much success
at two in the morning the rounds passed and broke for a moment the weariness of the night
finding that my companions would not be led into conversation i took out my pipe and laid down my musket to strike the match
in an instant the two sikhs were upon me
one of them snatched my firelock up and levelled it at my head while the other held a great knife to my throat and swore between his teeth that he would plunge it into me if i moved a step
my first thought was that these fellows were in league with the rebels and that this was the beginning of an assault
if our door were in the hands of the sepoys the place must fall and the women and children be treated as they were in cawnpore
maybe you gentlemen think that i am just making out a case for myself but i give you my word that when i thought of that though i felt the point of the knife at my throat i opened my mouth with the intention of giving a scream if it was my last one which might alarm the main guard
the man who held me seemed to know my thoughts for even as i braced myself to it he whispered 'don't make a noise
the fort is safe enough
there are no rebel dogs on this side of the river '
there was the ring of truth in what he said and i knew that if i raised my voice i was a dead man
i could read it in the fellow's brown eyes
i waited therefore in silence to see what it was that they wanted from me
'listen to me sahib ' said the taller and fiercer of the pair the one whom they called abdullah khan
'you must either be with us now or you must be silenced forever
the thing is too great a one for us to hesitate
either you are heart and soul with us on your oath on the cross of the christians or your body this night shall be thrown into the ditch and we shall pass over to our brothers in the rebel army
there is no middle way
which is it to be death or life
we can only give you three minutes to decide for the time is passing and all must be done before the rounds come again '
'how can i decide '
said i
'you have not told me what you want of me
but i tell you now that if it is anything against the safety of the fort i will have no truck with it so you can drive home your knife and welcome '
'it is nothing against the fort ' said he
'we only ask you to do that which your countrymen come to this land for
we ask you to be rich
if you will be one of us this night we will swear to you upon the naked knife and by the threefold oath which no sikh was ever known to break that you shall have your fair share of the loot
a quarter of the treasure shall be yours
we can say no fairer '
'but what is the treasure then '
i asked
'i am as ready to be rich as you can be if you will but show me how it can be done '
'you will swear then ' said he 'by the bones of your father by the honor of your mother by the cross of your faith to raise no hand and speak no word against us either now or afterwards '
'i will swear it ' i answered 'provided that the fort is not endangered '
'then my comrade and i will swear that you shall have a quarter of the treasure which shall be equally divided among the four of us '
'there are but three ' said i
'no dost akbar must have his share
we can tell the tale to you while we await them
do you stand at the gate mahomet singh and give notice of their coming
the thing stands thus sahib and i tell it to you because i know that an oath is binding upon a feringhee and that we may trust you
had you been a lying hindoo though you had sworn by all the gods in their false temples your blood would have been upon the knife and your body in the water
but the sikh knows the englishman and the englishman knows the sikh
hearken then to what i have to say
'there is a rajah in the northern provinces who has much wealth though his lands are small
much has come to him from his father and more still he has set by himself for he is of a low nature and hoards his gold rather than spend it
when the troubles broke out he would be friends both with the lion and the tiger with the sepoy and with the company's raj
soon however it seemed to him that the white men's day was come for through all the land he could hear of nothing but of their death and their overthrow
yet being a careful man he made such plans that come what might half at least of his treasure should be left to him
that which was in gold and silver he kept by him in the vaults of his palace but the most precious stones and the choicest pearls that he had he put in an iron box and sent it by a trusty servant who under the guise of a merchant should take it to the fort at agra there to lie until the land is at peace
thus if the rebels won he would have his money but if the company conquered his jewels would be saved to him
having thus divided his hoard he threw himself into the cause of the sepoys since they were strong upon his borders
by doing this mark you sahib his property becomes the due of those who have been true to their salt
'this pretended merchant who travels under the name of achmet is now in the city of agra and desires to gain his way into the fort
he has with him as travelling companion my foster brother dost akbar who knows his secret
dost akbar has promised this night to lead him to a side postern of the fort and has chosen this one for his purpose
here he will come presently and here he will find mahomet singh and myself awaiting him
the place is lonely and none shall know of his coming
the world shall know of the merchant achmet no more but the great treasure of the rajah shall be divided among us
what say you to it sahib '
in worcestershire the life of a man seems a great and a sacred thing but it is very different when there is fire and blood all round you and you have been used to meeting death at every turn
whether achmet the merchant lived or died was a thing as light as air to me but at the talk about the treasure my heart turned to it and i thought of what i might do in the old country with it and how my folk would stare when they saw their ne'er do well coming back with his pockets full of gold moidores
i had therefore already made up my mind
abdullah khan however thinking that i hesitated pressed the matter more closely
'consider sahib ' said he 'that if this man is taken by the commandant he will be hung or shot and his jewels taken by the government so that no man will be a rupee the better for them
now since we do the taking of him why should we not do the rest as well
the jewels will be as well with us as in the company's coffers
there will be enough to make every one of us rich men and great chiefs
no one can know about the matter for here we are cut off from all men
what could be better for the purpose
say again then sahib whether you are with us or if we must look upon you as an enemy '
'i am with you heart and soul ' said i
'it is well ' he answered handing me back my firelock
'you see that we trust you for your word like ours is not to be broken
we have now only to wait for my brother and the merchant '
'does your brother know then of what you will do '
i asked
'the plan is his
he has devised it
we will go to the gate and share the watch with mahomet singh '
the rain was still falling steadily for it was just the beginning of the wet season
brown heavy clouds were drifting across the sky and it was hard to see more than a stone cast
a deep moat lay in front of our door but the water was in places nearly dried up and it could easily be crossed
it was strange to me to be standing there with those two wild punjaubees waiting for the man who was coming to his death
suddenly my eye caught the glint of a shaded lantern at the other side of the moat
it vanished among the mound heaps and then appeared again coming slowly in our direction
'here they are '
i exclaimed
'you will challenge him sahib as usual ' whispered abdullah
'give him no cause for fear
send us in with him and we shall do the rest while you stay here on guard
have the lantern ready to uncover that we may be sure that it is indeed the man '
the light had flickered onwards now stopping and now advancing until i could see two dark figures upon the other side of the moat
i let them scramble down the sloping bank splash through the mire and climb half way up to the gate before i challenged them
'who goes there '
said i in a subdued voice
'friends ' came the answer
i uncovered my lantern and threw a flood of light upon them
the first was an enormous sikh with a black beard which swept nearly down to his cummerbund
outside of a show i have never seen so tall a man
the other was a little fat round fellow with a great yellow turban and a bundle in his hand done up in a shawl
he seemed to be all in a quiver with fear for his hands twitched as if he had the ague and his head kept turning to left and right with two bright little twinkling eyes like a mouse when he ventures out from his hole
it gave me the chills to think of killing him but i thought of the treasure and my heart set as hard as a flint within me
when he saw my white face he gave a little chirrup of joy and came running up towards me
'your protection sahib ' he panted 'your protection for the unhappy merchant achmet
i have travelled across rajpootana that i might seek the shelter of the fort at agra
i have been robbed and beaten and abused because i have been the friend of the company
it is a blessed night this when i am once more in safety i and my poor possessions '
'what have you in the bundle '
i asked
'an iron box ' he answered 'which contains one or two little family matters which are of no value to others but which i should be sorry to lose
yet i am not a beggar and i shall reward you young sahib and your governor also if he will give me the shelter i ask '
i could not trust myself to speak longer with the man
the more i looked at his fat frightened face the harder did it seem that we should slay him in cold blood
it was best to get it over
'take him to the main guard ' said i the two sikhs closed in upon him on each side and the giant walked behind while they marched in through the dark gate way
never was a man so compassed round with death
i remained at the gate way with the lantern
i could hear the measured tramp of their footsteps sounding through the lonely corridors
suddenly it ceased and i heard voices and a scuffle with the sound of blows
a moment later there came to my horror a rush of footsteps coming in my direction with the loud breathing of a running man
i turned my lantern down the long straight passage and there was the fat man running like the wind with a smear of blood across his face and close at his heels bounding like a tiger the great black bearded sikh with a knife flashing in his hand
i have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant
he was gaining on the sikh and i could see that if he once passed me and got to the open air he would save himself yet
my heart softened to him but again the thought of his treasure turned me hard and bitter
i cast my firelock between his legs as he raced past and he rolled twice over like a shot rabbit
ere he could stagger to his feet the sikh was upon him and buried his knife twice in his side
the man never uttered moan nor moved muscle but lay were he had fallen
i think myself that he may have broken his neck with the fall
you see gentlemen that i am keeping my promise
i am telling you every work of the business just exactly as it happened whether it is in my favor or not
he stopped and held out his manacled hands for the whiskey and water which holmes had brewed for him
for myself i confess that i had now conceived the utmost horror of the man not only for this cold blooded business in which he had been concerned but even more for the somewhat flippant and careless way in which he narrated it
whatever punishment was in store for him i felt that he might expect no sympathy from me
sherlock holmes and jones sat with their hands upon their knees deeply interested in the story but with the same disgust written upon their faces
he may have observed it for there was a touch of defiance in his voice and manner as he proceeded
it was all very bad no doubt said he
i should like to know how many fellows in my shoes would have refused a share of this loot when they knew that they would have their throats cut for their pains
besides it was my life or his when once he was in the fort
if he had got out the whole business would come to light and i should have been court martialled and shot as likely as not for people were not very lenient at a time like that
go on with your story said holmes shortly
well we carried him in abdullah akbar and i a fine weight he was too for all that he was so short
mahomet singh was left to guard the door
we took him to a place which the sikhs had already prepared
it was some distance off where a winding passage leads to a great empty hall the brick walls of which were all crumbling to pieces
the earth floor had sunk in at one place making a natural grave so we left achmet the merchant there having first covered him over with loose bricks
this done we all went back to the treasure
it lay where he had dropped it when he was first attacked
the box was the same which now lies open upon your table
a key was hung by a silken cord to that carved handle upon the top
we opened it and the light of the lantern gleamed upon a collection of gems such as i have read of and thought about when i was a little lad at pershore
it was blinding to look upon them
when we had feasted our eyes we took them all out and made a list of them
there were one hundred and forty three diamonds of the first water including one which has been called i believe 'the great mogul' and is said to be the second largest stone in existence
then there were ninety seven very fine emeralds and one hundred and seventy rubies some of which however were small
there were forty carbuncles two hundred and ten sapphires sixty one agates and a great quantity of beryls onyxes cats' eyes turquoises and other stones the very names of which i did not know at the time though i have become more familiar with them since
besides this there were nearly three hundred very fine pearls twelve of which were set in a gold coronet
by the way these last had been taken out of the chest and were not there when i recovered it
after we had counted our treasures we put them back into the chest and carried them to the gate way to show them to mahomet singh
then we solemnly renewed our oath to stand by each other and be true to our secret
we agreed to conceal our loot in a safe place until the country should be at peace again and then to divide it equally among ourselves
there was no use dividing it at present for if gems of such value were found upon us it would cause suspicion and there was no privacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them
we carried the box therefore into the same hall where we had buried the body and there under certain bricks in the best preserved wall we made a hollow and put our treasure
we made careful note of the place and next day i drew four plans one for each of us and put the sign of the four of us at the bottom for we had sworn that we should each always act for all so that none might take advantage
that is an oath that i can put my hand to my heart and swear that i have never broken
well there's no use my telling you gentlemen what came of the indian mutiny
after wilson took delhi and sir colin relieved lucknow the back of the business was broken
fresh troops came pouring in and nana sahib made himself scarce over the frontier
a flying column under colonel greathed came round to agra and cleared the pandies away from it
peace seemed to be settling upon the country and we four were beginning to hope that the time was at hand when we might safely go off with our shares of the plunder
in a moment however our hopes were shattered by our being arrested as the murderers of achmet
it came about in this way
when the rajah put his jewels into the hands of achmet he did it because he knew that he was a trusty man
they are suspicious folk in the east however so what does this rajah do but take a second even more trusty servant and set him to play the spy upon the first
this second man was ordered never to let achmet out of his sight and he followed him like his shadow
he went after him that night and saw him pass through the doorway
of course he thought he had taken refuge in the fort and applied for admission there himself next day but could find no trace of achmet
this seemed to him so strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guides who brought it to the ears of the commandant
a thorough search was quickly made and the body was discovered
thus at the very moment that we thought that all was safe we were all four seized and brought to trial on a charge of murder three of us because we had held the gate that night and the fourth because he was known to have been in the company of the murdered man
not a word about the jewels came out at the trial for the rajah had been deposed and driven out of india so no one had any particular interest in them
the murder however was clearly made out and it was certain that we must all have been concerned in it
the three sikhs got penal servitude for life and i was condemned to death though my sentence was afterwards commuted into the same as the others
it was rather a queer position that we found ourselves in then
there we were all four tied by the leg and with precious little chance of ever getting out again while we each held a secret which might have put each of us in a palace if we could only have made use of it
it was enough to make a man eat his heart out to have to stand the kick and the cuff of every petty jack in office to have rice to eat and water to drink when that gorgeous fortune was ready for him outside just waiting to be picked up
it might have driven me mad but i was always a pretty stubborn one so i just held on and bided my time
at last it seemed to me to have come
i was changed from agra to madras and from there to blair island in the andamans
there are very few white convicts at this settlement and as i had behaved well from the first i soon found myself a sort of privileged person
i was given a hut in hope town which is a small place on the slopes of mount harriet and i was left pretty much to myself
it is a dreary fever stricken place and all beyond our little clearings was infested with wild cannibal natives who were ready enough to blow a poisoned dart at us if they saw a chance
there was digging and ditching and yam planting and a dozen other things to be done so we were busy enough all day though in the evening we had a little time to ourselves
among other things i learned to dispense drugs for the surgeon and picked up a smattering of his knowledge
all the time i was on the lookout for a chance of escape but it is hundreds of miles from any other land and there is little or no wind in those seas so it was a terribly difficult job to get away
the surgeon dr
somerton was a fast sporting young chap and the other young officers would meet in his rooms of an evening and play cards
the surgery where i used to make up my drugs was next to his sitting room with a small window between us
often if i felt lonesome i used to turn out the lamp in the surgery and then standing there i could hear their talk and watch their play
i am fond of a hand at cards myself and it was almost as good as having one to watch the others
there was major sholto captain morstan and lieutenant bromley brown who were in command of the native troops and there was the surgeon himself and two or three prison officials crafty old hands who played a nice sly safe game
a very snug little party they used to make
well there was one thing which very soon struck me and that was that the soldiers used always to lose and the civilians to win
mind i don't say that there was anything unfair but so it was
these prison chaps had done little else than play cards ever since they had been at the andamans and they knew each other's game to a point while the others just played to pass the time and threw their cards down anyhow
night after night the soldiers got up poorer men and the poorer they got the more keen they were to play
major sholto was the hardest hit
he used to pay in notes and gold at first but soon it came to notes of hand and for big sums
he sometimes would win for a few deals just to give him heart and then the luck would set in against him worse than ever
all day he would wander about as black as thunder and he took to drinking a deal more than was good for him
one night he lost even more heavily than usual
i was sitting in my hut when he and captain morstan came stumbling along on the way to their quarters
they were bosom friends those two and never far apart
the major was raving about his losses
'it's all up morstan ' he was saying as they passed my hut
'i shall have to send in my papers
i am a ruined man '
'nonsense old chap '
said the other slapping him upon the shoulder
'i've had a nasty facer myself but ' that was all i could hear but it was enough to set me thinking
a couple of days later major sholto was strolling on the beach so i took the chance of speaking to him
'i wish to have your advice major ' said i
'well small what is it '
he asked taking his cheroot from his lips
'i wanted to ask you sir ' said i 'who is the proper person to whom hidden treasure should be handed over
i know where half a million worth lies and as i cannot use it myself i thought perhaps the best thing that i could do would be to hand it over to the proper authorities and then perhaps they would get my sentence shortened for me '
'half a million small '
he gasped looking hard at me to see if i was in earnest
'quite that sir in jewels and pearls
it lies there ready for any one
and the queer thing about it is that the real owner is outlawed and cannot hold property so that it belongs to the first comer '
'to government small ' he stammered 'to government '
but he said it in a halting fashion and i knew in my heart that i had got him
'you think then sir that i should give the information to the governor general '
said i quietly
'well well you must not do anything rash or that you might repent
let me hear all about it small
give me the facts '
i told him the whole story with small changes so that he could not identify the places
when i had finished he stood stock still and full of thought
i could see by the twitch of his lip that there was a struggle going on within him
'this is a very important matter small ' he said at last
'you must not say a word to any one about it and i shall see you again soon '
two nights later he and his friend captain morstan came to my hut in the dead of the night with a lantern
'i want you just to let captain morstan hear that story from your own lips small ' said he
i repeated it as i had told it before
'it rings true eh '
said he
'it's good enough to act upon '
captain morstan nodded
'look here small ' said the major
'we have been talking it over my friend here and i and we have come to the conclusion that this secret of yours is hardly a government matter after all but is a private concern of your own which of course you have the power of disposing of as you think best
now the question is what price would you ask for it
we might be inclined to take it up and at least look into it if we could agree as to terms '
he tried to speak in a cool careless way but his eyes were shining with excitement and greed
'why as to that gentlemen ' i answered trying also to be cool but feeling as excited as he did 'there is only one bargain which a man in my position can make
i shall want you to help me to my freedom and to help my three companions to theirs
we shall then take you into partnership and give you a fifth share to divide between you '
'hum '
said he
'a fifth share
that is not very tempting '
'it would come to fifty thousand apiece ' said i
'but how can we gain your freedom
you know very well that you ask an impossibility '
'nothing of the sort ' i answered
'i have thought it all out to the last detail
the only bar to our escape is that we can get no boat fit for the voyage and no provisions to last us for so long a time
there are plenty of little yachts and yawls at calcutta or madras which would serve our turn well
do you bring one over
we shall engage to get aboard her by night and if you will drop us on any part of the indian coast you will have done your part of the bargain '
'if there were only one ' he said
'none or all ' i answered
'we have sworn it
the four of us must always act together '
'you see morstan ' said he 'small is a man of his word
he does not flinch from his friend
i think we may very well trust him '
'it's a dirty business ' the other answered
'yet as you say the money would save our commissions handsomely '
'well small ' said the major 'we must i suppose try and meet you
we must first of course test the truth of your story
tell me where the box is hid and i shall get leave of absence and go back to india in the monthly relief boat to inquire into the affair '
'not so fast ' said i growing colder as he got hot
'i must have the consent of my three comrades
i tell you that it is four or none with us '
'nonsense '
he broke in
'what have three black fellows to do with our agreement '
'black or blue ' said i 'they are in with me and we all go together '
well the matter ended by a second meeting at which mahomet singh abdullah khan and dost akbar were all present
we talked the matter over again and at last we came to an arrangement
we were to provide both the officers with charts of the part of the agra fort and mark the place in the wall where the treasure was hid
major sholto was to go to india to test our story
if he found the box he was to leave it there to send out a small yacht provisioned for a voyage which was to lie off rutland island and to which we were to make our way and finally to return to his duties
captain morstan was then to apply for leave of absence to meet us at agra and there we were to have a final division of the treasure he taking the major's share as well as his own
all this we sealed by the most solemn oaths that the mind could think or the lips utter
i sat up all night with paper and ink and by the morning i had the two charts all ready signed with the sign of four that is of abdullah akbar mahomet and myself
well gentlemen i weary you with my long story and i know that my friend mr
jones is impatient to get me safely stowed in chokey
i'll make it as short as i can
the villain sholto went off to india but he never came back again
captain morstan showed me his name among a list of passengers in one of the mail boats very shortly afterwards
his uncle had died leaving him a fortune and he had left the army yet he could stoop to treat five men as he had treated us
morstan went over to agra shortly afterwards and found as we expected that the treasure was indeed gone
the scoundrel had stolen it all without carrying out one of the conditions on which we had sold him the secret
from that day i lived only for vengeance
i thought of it by day and i nursed it by night
it became an overpowering absorbing passion with me
i cared nothing for the law nothing for the gallows
to escape to track down sholto to have my hand upon his throat that was my one thought
even the agra treasure had come to be a smaller thing in my mind than the slaying of sholto
well i have set my mind on many things in this life and never one which i did not carry out
but it was weary years before my time came
i have told you that i had picked up something of medicine
one day when dr
somerton was down with a fever a little andaman islander was picked up by a convict gang in the woods
he was sick to death and had gone to a lonely place to die
i took him in hand though he was as venomous as a young snake and after a couple of months i got him all right and able to walk
he took a kind of fancy to me then and would hardly go back to his woods but was always hanging about my hut
i learned a little of his lingo from him and this made him all the fonder of me
tonga for that was his name was a fine boatman and owned a big roomy canoe of his own
when i found that he was devoted to me and would do anything to serve me i saw my chance of escape
i talked it over with him
he was to bring his boat round on a certain night to an old wharf which was never guarded and there he was to pick me up
i gave him directions to have several gourds of water and a lot of yams cocoa nuts and sweet potatoes
he was stanch and true was little tonga
no man ever had a more faithful mate
at the night named he had his boat at the wharf
as it chanced however there was one of the convict guard down there a vile pathan who had never missed a chance of insulting and injuring me
i had always vowed vengeance and now i had my chance
it was as if fate had placed him in my way that i might pay my debt before i left the island
he stood on the bank with his back to me and his carbine on his shoulder
i looked about for a stone to beat out his brains with but none could i see
then a queer thought came into my head and showed me where i could lay my hand on a weapon
i sat down in the darkness and unstrapped my wooden leg
with three long hops i was on him
he put his carbine to his shoulder but i struck him full and knocked the whole front of his skull in
you can see the split in the wood now where i hit him
we both went down together for i could not keep my balance but when i got up i found him still lying quiet enough
i made for the boat and in an hour we were well out at sea
tonga had brought all his earthly possessions with him his arms and his gods
among other things he had a long bamboo spear and some andaman cocoa nut matting with which i made a sort of sail
for ten days we were beating about trusting to luck and on the eleventh we were picked up by a trader which was going from singapore to jiddah with a cargo of malay pilgrims
they were a rum crowd and tonga and i soon managed to settle down among them
they had one very good quality they let you alone and asked no questions
well if i were to tell you all the adventures that my little chum and i went through you would not thank me for i would have you here until the sun was shining
here and there we drifted about the world something always turning up to keep us from london
all the time however i never lost sight of my purpose
i would dream of sholto at night
a hundred times i have killed him in my sleep
at last however some three or four years ago we found ourselves in england
i had no great difficulty in finding where sholto lived and i set to work to discover whether he had realized the treasure or if he still had it
i made friends with someone who could help me i name no names for i don't want to get any one else in a hole and i soon found that he still had the jewels
then i tried to get at him in many ways but he was pretty sly and had always two prize fighters besides his sons and his khitmutgar on guard over him
one day however i got word that he was dying
i hurried at once to the garden mad that he should slip out of my clutches like that and looking through the window i saw him lying in his bed with his sons on each side of him
i'd have come through and taken my chance with the three of them only even as i looked at him his jaw dropped and i knew that he was gone
i got into his room that same night though and i searched his papers to see if there was any record of where he had hidden our jewels
there was not a line however so i came away bitter and savage as a man could be
before i left i bethought me that if i ever met my sikh friends again it would be a satisfaction to know that i had left some mark of our hatred so i scrawled down the sign of the four of us as it had been on the chart and i pinned it on his bosom
it was too much that he should be taken to the grave without some token from the men whom he had robbed and befooled
we earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor tonga at fairs and other such places as the black cannibal
he would eat raw meat and dance his war dance so we always had a hatful of pennies after a day's work
i still heard all the news from pondicherry lodge and for some years there was no news to hear except that they were hunting for the treasure
at last however came what we had waited for so long
the treasure had been found
it was up at the top of the house in mr
bartholomew sholto's chemical laboratory
i came at once and had a look at the place but i could not see how with my wooden leg i was to make my way up to it
i learned however about a trap door in the roof and also about mr
sholto's supper hour
it seemed to me that i could manage the thing easily through tonga
i brought him out with me with a long rope wound round his waist
he could climb like a cat and he soon made his way through the roof but as ill luck would have it bartholomew sholto was still in the room to his cost
tonga thought he had done something very clever in killing him for when i came up by the rope i found him strutting about as proud as a peacock
very much surprised was he when i made at him with the rope's end and cursed him for a little blood thirsty imp
i took the treasure box and let it down and then slid down myself having first left the sign of the four upon the table to show that the jewels had come back at last to those who had most right to them
tonga then pulled up the rope closed the window and made off the way that he had come
i don't know that i have anything else to tell you
i had heard a waterman speak of the speed of smith's launch the aurora so i thought she would be a handy craft for our escape
i engaged with old smith and was to give him a big sum if he got us safe to our ship
he knew no doubt that there was some screw loose but he was not in our secrets
all this is the truth and if i tell it to you gentlemen it is not to amuse you for you have not done me a very good turn but it is because i believe the best defence i can make is just to hold back nothing but let all the world know how badly i have myself been served by major sholto and how innocent i am of the death of his son
a very remarkable account said sherlock holmes
a fitting wind up to an extremely interesting case
there is nothing at all new to me in the latter part of your narrative except that you brought your own rope
that i did not know
by the way i had hoped that tonga had lost all his darts yet he managed to shoot one at us in the boat
he had lost them all sir except the one which was in his blow pipe at the time
ah of course said holmes
i had not thought of that
is there any other point which you would like to ask about
asked the convict affably
i think not thank you my companion answered
well holmes said athelney jones you are a man to be humored and we all know that you are a connoisseur of crime but duty is duty and i have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend asked me
i shall feel more at ease when we have our story teller here safe under lock and key
the cab still waits and there are two inspectors down stairs
i am much obliged to you both for your assistance
of course you will be wanted at the trial
good night to you
good night gentlemen both said jonathan small
you first small remarked the wary jones as they left the room
i'll take particular care that you don't club me with your wooden leg whatever you may have done to the gentleman at the andaman isles
well and there is the end of our little drama i remarked after we had set some time smoking in silence
i fear that it may be the last investigation in which i shall have the chance of studying your methods
miss morstan has done me the honor to accept me as a husband in prospective
he gave a most dismal groan
i feared as much said he
i really cannot congratulate you
i was a little hurt
have you any reason to be dissatisfied with my choice
i asked
not at all
i think she is one of the most charming young ladies i ever met and might have been most useful in such work as we have been doing
she had a decided genius that way witness the way in which she preserved that agra plan from all the other papers of her father
but love is an emotional thing and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true cold reason which i place above all things
i should never marry myself lest i bias my judgment
i trust said i laughing that my judgment may survive the ordeal
but you look weary
yes the reaction is already upon me
i shall be as limp as a rag for a week
strange said i how terms of what in another man i should call laziness alternate with your fits of splendid energy and vigor
yes he answered there are in me the makings of a very fine loafer and also of a pretty spry sort of fellow
i often think of those lines of old goethe schade dass die natur nur einen mensch aus dir schuf denn zum wuerdigen mann war und zum schelmen der stoff
by the way a propos of this norwood business you see that they had as i surmised a confederate in the house who could be none other than lal rao the butler so jones actually has the undivided honor of having caught one fish in his great haul
the division seems rather unfair i remarked
you have done all the work in this business
i get a wife out of it jones gets the credit pray what remains for you
for me said sherlock holmes there still remains the cocaine bottle
and he stretched his long white hand up for it
mr
sherlock holmes who was usually very late in the mornings save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night was seated at the breakfast table
i stood upon the hearth rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before
it was a fine thick piece of wood bulbous headed of the sort which is known as a penang lawyer
just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch across
to james mortimer m r c s from his friends of the c c h was engraved upon it with the date
it was just such a stick as the old fashioned family practitioner used to carry dignified solid and reassuring
well watson what do you make of it
holmes was sitting with his back to me and i had given him no sign of my occupation
how did you know what i was doing
i believe you have eyes in the back of your head
i have at least a well polished silver plated coffee pot in front of me said he
but tell me watson what do you make of our visitor's stick
since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion of his errand this accidental souvenir becomes of importance
let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it
i think said i following as far as i could the methods of my companion that dr
mortimer is a successful elderly medical man well esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their appreciation
good
said holmes
excellent
i think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot
why so
because this stick though originally a very handsome one has been so knocked about that i can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it
the thick iron ferrule is worn down so it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with it
perfectly sound
said holmes
and then again there is the 'friends of the c c h '
i should guess that to be the something hunt the local hunt to whose members he has possibly given some surgical assistance and which has made him a small presentation in return
really watson you excel yourself said holmes pushing back his chair and lighting a cigarette
i am bound to say that in all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities
it may be that you are not yourself luminous but you are a conductor of light
some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it
i confess my dear fellow that i am very much in your debt
he had never said as much before and i must admit that his words gave me keen pleasure for i had often been piqued by his indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which i had made to give publicity to his methods
i was proud too to think that i had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way which earned his approval
he now took the stick from my hands and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes
then with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette and carrying the cane to the window he looked over it again with a convex lens
interesting though elementary said he as he returned to his favourite corner of the settee
there are certainly one or two indications upon the stick
it gives us the basis for several deductions
has anything escaped me
i asked with some self importance
i trust that there is nothing of consequence which i have overlooked
i am afraid my dear watson that most of your conclusions were erroneous
when i said that you stimulated me i meant to be frank that in noting your fallacies i was occasionally guided towards the truth
not that you are entirely wrong in this instance
the man is certainly a country practitioner
and he walks a good deal
then i was right
to that extent
but that was all
no no my dear watson not all by no means all
i would suggest for example that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt and that when the initials 'c c '
are placed before that hospital the words 'charing cross' very naturally suggest themselves
you may be right
the probability lies in that direction
and if we take this as a working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of this unknown visitor
well then supposing that 'c c h '
does stand for 'charing cross hospital ' what further inferences may we draw
do none suggest themselves
you know my methods
apply them
i can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised in town before going to the country
i think that we might venture a little farther than this
look at it in this light
on what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made
when would his friends unite to give him a pledge of their good will
obviously at the moment when dr
mortimer withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start a practice for himself
we know there has been a presentation
we believe there has been a change from a town hospital to a country practice
is it then stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change
it certainly seems probable
now you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of the hospital since only a man well established in a london practice could hold such a position and such a one would not drift into the country
what was he then
if he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a house surgeon or a house physician little more than a senior student
and he left five years ago the date is on the stick
so your grave middle aged family practitioner vanishes into thin air my dear watson and there emerges a young fellow under thirty amiable unambitious absent minded and the possessor of a favourite dog which i should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff
i laughed incredulously as sherlock holmes leaned back in his settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling
as to the latter part i have no means of checking you said i but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the man's age and professional career
from my small medical shelf i took down the medical directory and turned up the name
there were several mortimers but only one who could be our visitor
i read his record aloud
mortimer james m r c s grimpen dartmoor devon
house surgeon from to at charing cross hospital
winner of the jackson prize for comparative pathology with essay entitled 'is disease a reversion '
corresponding member of the swedish pathological society
author of 'some freaks of atavism' lancet
'do we progress '
journal of psychology march
medical officer for the parishes of grimpen thorsley and high barrow
no mention of that local hunt watson said holmes with a mischievous smile but a country doctor as you very astutely observed
i think that i am fairly justified in my inferences
as to the adjectives i said if i remember right amiable unambitious and absent minded
it is my experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials only an unambitious one who abandons a london career for the country and only an absent minded one who leaves his stick and not his visiting card after waiting an hour in your room
and the dog
has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master
being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible
the dog's jaw as shown in the space between these marks is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff
it may have been yes by jove it is a curly haired spaniel
he had risen and paced the room as he spoke
now he halted in the recess of the window
there was such a ring of conviction in his voice that i glanced up in surprise
my dear fellow how can you possibly be so sure of that
for the very simple reason that i see the dog himself on our very door step and there is the ring of its owner
don't move i beg you watson
he is a professional brother of yours and your presence may be of assistance to me
now is the dramatic moment of fate watson when you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life and you know not whether for good or ill
what does dr
james mortimer the man of science ask of sherlock holmes the specialist in crime
come in
the appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me since i had expected a typical country practitioner
he was a very tall thin man with a long nose like a beak which jutted out between two keen gray eyes set closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of gold rimmed glasses
he was clad in a professional but rather slovenly fashion for his frock coat was dingy and his trousers frayed
though young his long back was already bowed and he walked with a forward thrust of his head and a general air of peering benevolence
as he entered his eyes fell upon the stick in holmes's hand and he ran towards it with an exclamation of joy
i am so very glad said he
i was not sure whether i had left it here or in the shipping office
i would not lose that stick for the world
a presentation i see said holmes
yes sir
from charing cross hospital
from one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage
dear dear that's bad
said holmes shaking his head
dr
mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment
why was it bad
only that you have disarranged our little deductions
your marriage you say
yes sir
i married and so left the hospital and with it all hopes of a consulting practice
it was necessary to make a home of my own
come come we are not so far wrong after all said holmes
and now dr
james mortimer mister sir mister a humble m r c s
and a man of precise mind evidently
a dabbler in science mr
holmes a picker up of shells on the shores of the great unknown ocean
i presume that it is mr
sherlock holmes whom i am addressing and not no this is my friend dr
watson
glad to meet you sir
i have heard your name mentioned in connection with that of your friend
you interest me very much mr
holmes
i had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well marked supra orbital development
would you have any objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure
a cast of your skull sir until the original is available would be an ornament to any anthropological museum
it is not my intention to be fulsome but i confess that i covet your skull
sherlock holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair
you are an enthusiast in your line of thought i perceive sir as i am in mine said he
i observe from your forefinger that you make your own cigarettes
have no hesitation in lighting one
the man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the other with surprising dexterity
he had long quivering fingers as agile and restless as the antennae of an insect
holmes was silent but his little darting glances showed me the interest which he took in our curious companion
i presume sir said he at last that it was not merely for the purpose of examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here last night and again today
no sir no though i am happy to have had the opportunity of doing that as well
i came to you mr
holmes because i recognized that i am myself an unpractical man and because i am suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary problem
recognizing as i do that you are the second highest expert in europe indeed sir
may i inquire who has the honour to be the first
asked holmes with some asperity
to the man of precisely scientific mind the work of monsieur bertillon must always appeal strongly
then had you not better consult him
i said sir to the precisely scientific mind
but as a practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone
i trust sir that i have not inadvertently just a little said holmes
i think dr
mortimer you would do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my assistance
i have in my pocket a manuscript said dr
james mortimer
i observed it as you entered the room said holmes
it is an old manuscript
early eighteenth century unless it is a forgery
how can you say that sir
you have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the time that you have been talking
it would be a poor expert who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so
you may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject
i put that at
the exact date is
dr
mortimer drew it from his breast pocket
this family paper was committed to my care by sir charles baskerville whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much excitement in devonshire
i may say that i was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant
he was a strong minded man sir shrewd practical and as unimaginative as i am myself
yet he took this document very seriously and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did eventually overtake him
holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon his knee
you will observe watson the alternative use of the long s and the short
it is one of several indications which enabled me to fix the date
i looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script
at the head was written baskerville hall and below in large scrawling figures
it appears to be a statement of some sort
yes it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the baskerville family
but i understand that it is something more modern and practical upon which you wish to consult me
most modern
a most practical pressing matter which must be decided within twenty four hours
but the manuscript is short and is intimately connected with the affair
with your permission i will read it to you
holmes leaned back in his chair placed his finger tips together and closed his eyes with an air of resignation
dr
mortimer turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high cracking voice the following curious old world narrative of the origin of the hound of the baskervilles there have been many statements yet as i come in a direct line from hugo baskerville and as i had the story from my father who also had it from his i have set it down with all belief that it occurred even as is here set forth
and i would have you believe my sons that the same justice which punishes sin may also most graciously forgive it and that no ban is so heavy but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed
learn then from this story not to fear the fruits of the past but rather to be circumspect in the future that those foul passions whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not again be loosed to our undoing
know then that in the time of the great rebellion the history of which by the learned lord clarendon i most earnestly commend to your attention this manor of baskerville was held by hugo of that name nor can it be gainsaid that he was a most wild profane and godless man
this in truth his neighbours might have pardoned seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts but there was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his name a by word through the west
it chanced that this hugo came to love if indeed so dark a passion may be known under so bright a name the daughter of a yeoman who held lands near the baskerville estate
but the young maiden being discreet and of good repute would ever avoid him for she feared his evil name
so it came to pass that one michaelmas this hugo with five or six of his idle and wicked companions stole down upon the farm and carried off the maiden her father and brothers being from home as he well knew
when they had brought her to the hall the maiden was placed in an upper chamber while hugo and his friends sat down to a long carouse as was their nightly custom
now the poor lass upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her from below for they say that the words used by hugo baskerville when he was in wine were such as might blast the man who said them
at last in the stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted the bravest or most active man for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered and still covers the south wall she came down from under the eaves and so homeward across the moor there being three leagues betwixt the hall and her father's farm
it chanced that some little time later hugo left his guests to carry food and drink with other worse things perchance to his captive and so found the cage empty and the bird escaped
then as it would seem he became as one that hath a devil for rushing down the stairs into the dining hall he sprang upon the great table flagons and trenchers flying before him and he cried aloud before all the company that he would that very night render his body and soul to the powers of evil if he might but overtake the wench
and while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of the man one more wicked or it may be more drunken than the rest cried out that they should put the hounds upon her
whereat hugo ran from the house crying to his grooms that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack and giving the hounds a kerchief of the maid's he swung them to the line and so off full cry in the moonlight over the moor
now for some space the revellers stood agape unable to understand all that had been done in such haste
but anon their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which was like to be done upon the moorlands
everything was now in an uproar some calling for their pistols some for their horses and some for another flask of wine
but at length some sense came back to their crazed minds and the whole of them thirteen in number took horse and started in pursuit
the moon shone clear above them and they rode swiftly abreast taking that course which the maid must needs have taken if she were to reach her own home
they had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the night shepherds upon the moorlands and they cried to him to know if he had seen the hunt
and the man as the story goes was so crazed with fear that he could scarce speak but at last he said that he had indeed seen the unhappy maiden with the hounds upon her track
'but i have seen more than that ' said he 'for hugo baskerville passed me upon his black mare and there ran mute behind him such a hound of hell as god forbid should ever be at my heels '
so the drunken squires cursed the shepherd and rode onward
but soon their skins turned cold for there came a galloping across the moor and the black mare dabbled with white froth went past with trailing bridle and empty saddle
then the revellers rode close together for a great fear was on them but they still followed over the moor though each had he been alone would have been right glad to have turned his horse's head
riding slowly in this fashion they came at last upon the hounds
these though known for their valour and their breed were whimpering in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal as we call it upon the moor some slinking away and some with starting hackles and staring eyes gazing down the narrow valley before them
the company had come to a halt more sober men as you may guess than when they started
the most of them would by no means advance but three of them the boldest or it may be the most drunken rode forward down the goyal
now it opened into a broad space in which stood two of those great stones still to be seen there which were set by certain forgotten peoples in the days of old
the moon was shining bright upon the clearing and there in the centre lay the unhappy maid where she had fallen dead of fear and of fatigue
but it was not the sight of her body nor yet was it that of the body of hugo baskerville lying near her which raised the hair upon the heads of these three dare devil roysterers but it was that standing over hugo and plucking at his throat there stood a foul thing a great black beast shaped like a hound yet larger than any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon
and even as they looked the thing tore the throat out of hugo baskerville on which as it turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them the three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life still screaming across the moor
one it is said died that very night of what he had seen and the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their days
such is the tale my sons of the coming of the hound which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever since
if i have set it down it is because that which is clearly known hath less terror than that which is but hinted at and guessed
nor can it be denied that many of the family have been unhappy in their deaths which have been sudden bloody and mysterious
yet may we shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of providence which would not forever punish the innocent beyond that third or fourth generation which is threatened in holy writ
to that providence my sons i hereby commend you and i counsel you by way of caution to forbear from crossing the moor in those dark hours when the powers of evil are exalted
this from hugo baskerville to his sons rodger and john with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their sister elizabeth
when dr
mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at mr
sherlock holmes
the latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the fire
well
said he
do you not find it interesting
to a collector of fairy tales
dr
mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket
now mr
holmes we will give you something a little more recent
this is the devon county chronicle of may 14th of this year
it is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of sir charles baskerville which occurred a few days before that date
my friend leaned a little forward and his expression became intent
our visitor readjusted his glasses and began the recent sudden death of sir charles baskerville whose name has been mentioned as the probable liberal candidate for mid devon at the next election has cast a gloom over the county
though sir charles had resided at baskerville hall for a comparatively short period his amiability of character and extreme generosity had won the affection and respect of all who had been brought into contact with him
in these days of nouveaux riches it is refreshing to find a case where the scion of an old county family which has fallen upon evil days is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him to restore the fallen grandeur of his line
sir charles as is well known made large sums of money in south african speculation
more wise than those who go on until the wheel turns against them he realized his gains and returned to england with them
it is only two years since he took up his residence at baskerville hall and it is common talk how large were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement which have been interrupted by his death
being himself childless it was his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should within his own lifetime profit by his good fortune and many will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end
his generous donations to local and county charities have been frequently chronicled in these columns
the circumstances connected with the death of sir charles cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the inquest but at least enough has been done to dispose of those rumours to which local superstition has given rise
there is no reason whatever to suspect foul play or to imagine that death could be from any but natural causes
sir charles was a widower and a man who may be said to have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind
in spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his personal tastes and his indoor servants at baskerville hall consisted of a married couple named barrymore the husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper
their evidence corroborated by that of several friends tends to show that sir charles's health has for some time been impaired and points especially to some affection of the heart manifesting itself in changes of colour breathlessness and acute attacks of nervous depression
dr
james mortimer the friend and medical attendant of the deceased has given evidence to the same effect
the facts of the case are simple
sir charles baskerville was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking down the famous yew alley of baskerville hall
the evidence of the barrymores shows that this had been his custom
on the fourth of may sir charles had declared his intention of starting next day for london and had ordered barrymore to prepare his luggage
that night he went out as usual for his nocturnal walk in the course of which he was in the habit of smoking a cigar
he never returned
at twelve o'clock barrymore finding the hall door still open became alarmed and lighting a lantern went in search of his master
the day had been wet and sir charles's footmarks were easily traced down the alley
halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on to the moor
there were indications that sir charles had stood for some little time here
he then proceeded down the alley and it was at the far end of it that his body was discovered
one fact which has not been explained is the statement of barrymore that his master's footprints altered their character from the time that he passed the moor gate and that he appeared from thence onward to have been walking upon his toes
one murphy a gipsy horse dealer was on the moor at no great distance at the time but he appears by his own confession to have been the worse for drink
he declares that he heard cries but is unable to state from what direction they came
no signs of violence were to be discovered upon sir charles's person and though the doctor's evidence pointed to an almost incredible facial distortion so great that dr
mortimer refused at first to believe that it was indeed his friend and patient who lay before him it was explained that that is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of dyspnoea and death from cardiac exhaustion
this explanation was borne out by the post mortem examination which showed long standing organic disease and the coroner's jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence
it is well that this is so for it is obviously of the utmost importance that sir charles's heir should settle at the hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly interrupted
had the prosaic finding of the coroner not finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been whispered in connection with the affair it might have been difficult to find a tenant for baskerville hall
it is understood that the next of kin is mr
henry baskerville if he be still alive the son of sir charles baskerville's younger brother
the young man when last heard of was in america and inquiries are being instituted with a view to informing him of his good fortune
dr
mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket
those are the public facts mr
holmes in connection with the death of sir charles baskerville
i must thank you said sherlock holmes for calling my attention to a case which certainly presents some features of interest
i had observed some newspaper comment at the time but i was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the vatican cameos and in my anxiety to oblige the pope i lost touch with several interesting english cases
this article you say contains all the public facts
it does
then let me have the private ones
he leaned back put his finger tips together and assumed his most impassive and judicial expression
in doing so said dr
mortimer who had begun to show signs of some strong emotion i am telling that which i have not confided to anyone
my motive for withholding it from the coroner's inquiry is that a man of science shrinks from placing himself in the public position of seeming to indorse a popular superstition
i had the further motive that baskerville hall as the paper says would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to increase its already rather grim reputation
for both these reasons i thought that i was justified in telling rather less than i knew since no practical good could result from it but with you there is no reason why i should not be perfectly frank
the moor is very sparsely inhabited and those who live near each other are thrown very much together
for this reason i saw a good deal of sir charles baskerville
with the exception of mr
frankland of lafter hall and mr
stapleton the naturalist there are no other men of education within many miles
sir charles was a retiring man but the chance of his illness brought us together and a community of interests in science kept us so
he had brought back much scientific information from south africa and many a charming evening we have spent together discussing the comparative anatomy of the bushman and the hottentot
within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that sir charles's nervous system was strained to the breaking point
he had taken this legend which i have read you exceedingly to heart so much so that although he would walk in his own grounds nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at night
incredible as it may appear to you mr
holmes he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family and certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors were not encouraging
the idea of some ghastly presence constantly haunted him and on more than one occasion he has asked me whether i had on my medical journeys at night ever seen any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound
the latter question he put to me several times and always with a voice which vibrated with excitement
i can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some three weeks before the fatal event
he chanced to be at his hall door
i had descended from my gig and was standing in front of him when i saw his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror
i whisked round and had just time to catch a glimpse of something which i took to be a large black calf passing at the head of the drive
so excited and alarmed was he that i was compelled to go down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for it
it was gone however and the incident appeared to make the worst impression upon his mind
i stayed with him all the evening and it was on that occasion to explain the emotion which he had shown that he confided to my keeping that narrative which i read to you when first i came
i mention this small episode because it assumes some importance in view of the tragedy which followed but i was convinced at the time that the matter was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no justification
it was at my advice that sir charles was about to go to london
his heart was i knew affected and the constant anxiety in which he lived however chimerical the cause of it might be was evidently having a serious effect upon his health
i thought that a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a new man
mr
stapleton a mutual friend who was much concerned at his state of health was of the same opinion
at the last instant came this terrible catastrophe
on the night of sir charles's death barrymore the butler who made the discovery sent perkins the groom on horseback to me and as i was sitting up late i was able to reach baskerville hall within an hour of the event
i checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned at the inquest
i followed the footsteps down the yew alley i saw the spot at the moor gate where he seemed to have waited i remarked the change in the shape of the prints after that point i noted that there were no other footsteps save those of barrymore on the soft gravel and finally i carefully examined the body which had not been touched until my arrival
sir charles lay on his face his arms out his fingers dug into the ground and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to such an extent that i could hardly have sworn to his identity
there was certainly no physical injury of any kind
but one false statement was made by barrymore at the inquest
he said that there were no traces upon the ground round the body
he did not observe any
but i did some little distance off but fresh and clear
footprints
footprints
a man's or a woman's
dr
mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant and his voice sank almost to a whisper as he answered
mr
holmes they were the footprints of a gigantic hound
i confess at these words a shudder passed through me
there was a thrill in the doctor's voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved by that which he told us
holmes leaned forward in his excitement and his eyes had the hard dry glitter which shot from them when he was keenly interested
you saw this
as clearly as i see you
and you said nothing
what was the use
how was it that no one else saw it
the marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave them a thought
i don't suppose i should have done so had i not known this legend
there are many sheep dogs on the moor
no doubt but this was no sheep dog
you say it was large
enormous
but it had not approached the body
no
what sort of night was it '
damp and raw
but not actually raining
no
what is the alley like
there are two lines of old yew hedge twelve feet high and impenetrable
the walk in the centre is about eight feet across
is there anything between the hedges and the walk
yes there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either side
i understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a gate
yes the wicket gate which leads on to the moor
is there any other opening
none
so that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it from the house or else to enter it by the moor gate
there is an exit through a summer house at the far end
had sir charles reached this
no he lay about fifty yards from it
now tell me dr
mortimer and this is important the marks which you saw were on the path and not on the grass
no marks could show on the grass
were they on the same side of the path as the moor gate
yes they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the moor gate
you interest me exceedingly
another point
was the wicket gate closed
closed and padlocked
how high was it
about four feet high
then anyone could have got over it
yes
and what marks did you see by the wicket gate
none in particular
good heaven
did no one examine
yes i examined myself
and found nothing
it was all very confused
sir charles had evidently stood there for five or ten minutes
how do you know that
because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar
excellent
this is a colleague watson after our own heart
but the marks
he had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel
i could discern no others
sherlock holmes struck his hand against his knee with an impatient gesture
if i had only been there
he cried
it is evidently a case of extraordinary interest and one which presented immense opportunities to the scientific expert
that gravel page upon which i might have read so much has been long ere this smudged by the rain and defaced by the clogs of curious peasants
oh dr
mortimer dr
mortimer to think that you should not have called me in
you have indeed much to answer for
i could not call you in mr
holmes without disclosing these facts to the world and i have already given my reasons for not wishing to do so
besides besides why do you hesitate
there is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of detectives is helpless
you mean that the thing is supernatural
i did not positively say so
no but you evidently think it
since the tragedy mr
holmes there have come to my ears several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled order of nature
for example
i find that before the terrible event occurred several people had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this baskerville demon and which could not possibly be any animal known to science
they all agreed that it was a huge creature luminous ghastly and spectral
i have cross examined these men one of them a hard headed countryman one a farrier and one a moorland farmer who all tell the same story of this dreadful apparition exactly corresponding to the hell hound of the legend
i assure you that there is a reign of terror in the district and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at night
and you a trained man of science believe it to be supernatural
i do not know what to believe
holmes shrugged his shoulders
i have hitherto confined my investigations to this world said he
in a modest way i have combated evil but to take on the father of evil himself would perhaps be too ambitious a task
yet you must admit that the footmark is material
the original hound was material enough to tug a man's throat out and yet he was diabolical as well
i see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists
but now dr
mortimer tell me this
if you hold these views why have you come to consult me at all
you tell me in the same breath that it is useless to investigate sir charles's death and that you desire me to do it
i did not say that i desired you to do it
then how can i assist you
by advising me as to what i should do with sir henry baskerville who arrives at waterloo station dr
mortimer looked at his watch in exactly one hour and a quarter
he being the heir
yes
on the death of sir charles we inquired for this young gentleman and found that he had been farming in canada
from the accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every way
i speak now not as a medical man but as a trustee and executor of sir charles's will
there is no other claimant i presume
none
the only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was rodger baskerville the youngest of three brothers of whom poor sir charles was the elder
the second brother who died young is the father of this lad henry
the third rodger was the black sheep of the family
he came of the old masterful baskerville strain and was the very image they tell me of the family picture of old hugo
he made england too hot to hold him fled to central america and died there in of yellow fever
henry is the last of the baskervilles
in one hour and five minutes i meet him at waterloo station
i have had a wire that he arrived at southampton this morning
now mr
holmes what would you advise me to do with him
why should he not go to the home of his fathers
it seems natural does it not
and yet consider that every baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate
i feel sure that if sir charles could have spoken with me before his death he would have warned me against bringing this the last of the old race and the heir to great wealth to that deadly place
and yet it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor bleak countryside depends upon his presence
all the good work which has been done by sir charles will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the hall
i fear lest i should be swayed too much by my own obvious interest in the matter and that is why i bring the case before you and ask for your advice
holmes considered for a little time
put into plain words the matter is this said he
in your opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes dartmoor an unsafe abode for a baskerville that is your opinion
at least i might go the length of saying that there is some evidence that this may be so
exactly
but surely if your supernatural theory be correct it could work the young man evil in london as easily as in devonshire
a devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too inconceivable a thing
you put the matter more flippantly mr
holmes than you would probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these things
your advice then as i understand it is that the young man will be as safe in devonshire as in london
he comes in fifty minutes
what would you recommend
i recommend sir that you take a cab call off your spaniel who is scratching at my front door and proceed to waterloo to meet sir henry baskerville
and then
and then you will say nothing to him at all until i have made up my mind about the matter
how long will it take you to make up your mind
twenty four hours
at ten o'clock tomorrow dr
mortimer i will be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here and it will be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring sir henry baskerville with you
i will do so mr
holmes
he scribbled the appointment on his shirt cuff and hurried off in his strange peering absent minded fashion
holmes stopped him at the head of the stair
only one more question dr
mortimer
you say that before sir charles baskerville's death several people saw this apparition upon the moor
three people did
did any see it after
i have not heard of any
thank you
good morning
holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him
going out watson
unless i can help you
no my dear fellow it is at the hour of action that i turn to you for aid
but this is splendid really unique from some points of view
when you pass bradley's would you ask him to send up a pound of the strongest shag tobacco
thank you
it would be as well if you could make it convenient not to return before evening
then i should be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this morning
i knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he weighed every particle of evidence constructed alternative theories balanced one against the other and made up his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial
i therefore spent the day at my club and did not return to baker street until evening
it was nearly nine o'clock when i found myself in the sitting room once more
my first impression as i opened the door was that a fire had broken out for the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp upon the table was blurred by it
as i entered however my fears were set at rest for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco which took me by the throat and set me coughing
through the haze i had a vague vision of holmes in his dressing gown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay pipe between his lips
several rolls of paper lay around him
caught cold watson
said he
no it's this poisonous atmosphere
i suppose it is pretty thick now that you mention it
thick
it is intolerable
open the window then
you have been at your club all day i perceive
my dear holmes
am i right
certainly but how
he laughed at my bewildered expression
there is a delightful freshness about you watson which makes it a pleasure to exercise any small powers which i possess at your expense
a gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day
he returns immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his boots
he has been a fixture therefore all day
he is not a man with intimate friends
where then could he have been
is it not obvious
well it is rather obvious
the world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes
where do you think that i have been
a fixture also
on the contrary i have been to devonshire
in spirit
exactly
my body has remained in this armchair and has i regret to observe consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an incredible amount of tobacco
after you left i sent down to stamford's for the ordnance map of this portion of the moor and my spirit has hovered over it all day
i flatter myself that i could find my way about
a large scale map i presume
very large
he unrolled one section and held it over his knee
here you have the particular district which concerns us
that is baskerville hall in the middle
with a wood round it
exactly
i fancy the yew alley though not marked under that name must stretch along this line with the moor as you perceive upon the right of it
this small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of grimpen where our friend dr
mortimer has his headquarters
within a radius of five miles there are as you see only a very few scattered dwellings
here is lafter hall which was mentioned in the narrative
there is a house indicated here which may be the residence of the naturalist stapleton if i remember right was his name
here are two moorland farmhouses high tor and foulmire
then fourteen miles away the great convict prison of princetown
between and around these scattered points extends the desolate lifeless moor
this then is the stage upon which tragedy has been played and upon which we may help to play it again
it must be a wild place
yes the setting is a worthy one
if the devil did desire to have a hand in the affairs of men then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation
the devil's agents may be of flesh and blood may they not
there are two questions waiting for us at the outset
the one is whether any crime has been committed at all the second is what is the crime and how was it committed
of course if dr
mortimer's surmise should be correct and we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws of nature there is an end of our investigation
but we are bound to exhaust all other hypotheses before falling back upon this one
i think we'll shut that window again if you don't mind
it is a singular thing but i find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of thought
i have not pushed it to the length of getting into a box to think but that is the logical outcome of my convictions
have you turned the case over in your mind
yes i have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day
what do you make of it
it is very bewildering
it has certainly a character of its own
there are points of distinction about it
that change in the footprints for example
what do you make of that
mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of the alley
he only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest
why should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley
what then
he was running watson running desperately running for his life running until he burst his heart and fell dead upon his face
running from what
there lies our problem
there are indications that the man was crazed with fear before ever he began to run
how can you say that
i am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the moor
if that were so and it seems most probable only a man who had lost his wits would have run from the house instead of towards it
if the gipsy's evidence may be taken as true he ran with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely to be
then again whom was he waiting for that night and why was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in his own house
you think that he was waiting for someone
the man was elderly and infirm
we can understand his taking an evening stroll but the ground was damp and the night inclement
is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes as dr
mortimer with more practical sense than i should have given him credit for deduced from the cigar ash
but he went out every evening
i think it unlikely that he waited at the moor gate every evening
on the contrary the evidence is that he avoided the moor
that night he waited there
it was the night before he made his departure for london
the thing takes shape watson
it becomes coherent
might i ask you to hand me my violin and we will postpone all further thought upon this business until we have had the advantage of meeting dr
mortimer and sir henry baskerville in the morning
our breakfast table was cleared early and holmes waited in his dressing gown for the promised interview
our clients were punctual to their appointment for the clock had just struck ten when dr
mortimer was shown up followed by the young baronet
the latter was a small alert dark eyed man about thirty years of age very sturdily built with thick black eyebrows and a strong pugnacious face
he wore a ruddy tinted tweed suit and had the weather beaten appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air and yet there was something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the gentleman
this is sir henry baskerville said dr
mortimer
why yes said he and the strange thing is mr
sherlock holmes that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this morning i should have come on my own account
i understand that you think out little puzzles and i've had one this morning which wants more thinking out than i am able to give it
pray take a seat sir henry
do i understand you to say that you have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in london
nothing of much importance mr
holmes
only a joke as like as not
it was this letter if you can call it a letter which reached me this morning
he laid an envelope upon the table and we all bent over it
it was of common quality grayish in colour
the address sir henry baskerville northumberland hotel was printed in rough characters the post mark charing cross and the date of posting the preceding evening
who knew that you were going to the northumberland hotel
asked holmes glancing keenly across at our visitor
no one could have known
we only decided after i met dr
mortimer
but dr
mortimer was no doubt already stopping there
no i had been staying with a friend said the doctor
there was no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel
hum
someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements
out of the envelope he took a half sheet of foolscap paper folded into four
this he opened and spread flat upon the table
across the middle of it a single sentence had been formed by the expedient of pasting printed words upon it
it ran as you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor
the word moor only was printed in ink
now said sir henry baskerville perhaps you will tell me mr
holmes what in thunder is the meaning of that and who it is that takes so much interest in my affairs
what do you make of it dr
mortimer
you must allow that there is nothing supernatural about this at any rate
no sir but it might very well come from someone who was convinced that the business is supernatural
what business
asked sir henry sharply
it seems to me that all you gentlemen know a great deal more than i do about my own affairs
you shall share our knowledge before you leave this room sir henry
i promise you that said sherlock holmes
we will confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this very interesting document which must have been put together and posted yesterday evening
have you yesterday's times watson
it is here in the corner
might i trouble you for it the inside page please with the leading articles
he glanced swiftly over it running his eyes up and down the columns
capital article this on free trade
permit me to give you an extract from it
'you may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff but it stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run keep away wealth from the country diminish the value of our imports and lower the general conditions of life in this island '
what do you think of that watson
cried holmes in high glee rubbing his hands together with satisfaction
don't you think that is an admirable sentiment
dr
mortimer looked at holmes with an air of professional interest and sir henry baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me
i don't know much about the tariff and things of that kind said he but it seems to me we've got a bit off the trail so far as that note is concerned
on the contrary i think we are particularly hot upon the trail sir henry
watson here knows more about my methods than you do but i fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of this sentence
no i confess that i see no connection
and yet my dear watson there is so very close a connection that the one is extracted out of the other
'you ' 'your ' 'your ' 'life ' 'reason ' 'value ' 'keep away ' 'from the '
don't you see now whence these words have been taken
by thunder you're right
well if that isn't smart
cried sir henry
if any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that 'keep away' and 'from the' are cut out in one piece
well now so it is
really mr
holmes this exceeds anything which i could have imagined said dr
mortimer gazing at my friend in amazement
i could understand anyone saying that the words were from a newspaper but that you should name which and add that it came from the leading article is really one of the most remarkable things which i have ever known
how did you do it
i presume doctor that you could tell the skull of a negro from that of an esquimau
most certainly
but how
because that is my special hobby
the differences are obvious
the supra orbital crest the facial angle the maxillary curve the but this is my special hobby and the differences are equally obvious
there is as much difference to my eyes between the leaded bourgeois type of a times article and the slovenly print of an evening half penny paper as there could be between your negro and your esquimau
the detection of types is one of the most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in crime though i confess that once when i was very young i confused the leeds mercury with the western morning news
but a times leader is entirely distinctive and these words could have been taken from nothing else
as it was done yesterday the strong probability was that we should find the words in yesterday's issue
so far as i can follow you then mr
holmes said sir henry baskerville someone cut out this message with a scissors nail scissors said holmes
you can see that it was a very short bladed scissors since the cutter had to take two snips over 'keep away '
that is so
someone then cut out the message with a pair of short bladed scissors pasted it with paste gum said holmes
with gum on to the paper
but i want to know why the word 'moor' should have been written
because he could not find it in print
the other words were all simple and might be found in any issue but 'moor' would be less common
why of course that would explain it
have you read anything else in this message mr
holmes
there are one or two indications and yet the utmost pains have been taken to remove all clues
the address you observe is printed in rough characters
but the times is a paper which is seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated
we may take it therefore that the letter was composed by an educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one and his effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing might be known or come to be known by you
again you will observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line but that some are much higher than others
'life ' for example is quite out of its proper place
that may point to carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter
on the whole i incline to the latter view since the matter was evidently important and it is unlikely that the composer of such a letter would be careless
if he were in a hurry it opens up the interesting question why he should be in a hurry since any letter posted up to early morning would reach sir henry before he would leave his hotel
did the composer fear an interruption and from whom
we are coming now rather into the region of guesswork said dr
mortimer
say rather into the region where we balance probabilities and choose the most likely
it is the scientific use of the imagination but we have always some material basis on which to start our speculation
now you would call it a guess no doubt but i am almost certain that this address has been written in a hotel
how in the world can you say that
if you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the ink have given the writer trouble
the pen has spluttered twice in a single word and has run dry three times in a short address showing that there was very little ink in the bottle
now a private pen or ink bottle is seldom allowed to be in such a state and the combination of the two must be quite rare
but you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen where it is rare to get anything else
yes i have very little hesitation in saying that could we examine the waste paper baskets of the hotels around charing cross until we found the remains of the mutilated times leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent this singular message
halloa
halloa
what's this
he was carefully examining the foolscap upon which the words were pasted holding it only an inch or two from his eyes
well
nothing said he throwing it down
it is a blank half sheet of paper without even a water mark upon it
i think we have drawn as much as we can from this curious letter and now sir henry has anything else of interest happened to you since you have been in london
why no mr
holmes
i think not
you have not observed anyone follow or watch you
i seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel said our visitor
why in thunder should anyone follow or watch me
we are coming to that
you have nothing else to report to us before we go into this matter
well it depends upon what you think worth reporting
i think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth reporting
sir henry smiled
i don't know much of british life yet for i have spent nearly all my time in the states and in canada
but i hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of life over here
you have lost one of your boots
my dear sir cried dr
mortimer it is only mislaid
you will find it when you return to the hotel
what is the use of troubling mr
holmes with trifles of this kind
well he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine
exactly said holmes however foolish the incident may seem
you have lost one of your boots you say
well mislaid it anyhow
i put them both outside my door last night and there was only one in the morning
i could get no sense out of the chap who cleans them
the worst of it is that i only bought the pair last night in the strand and i have never had them on
if you have never worn them why did you put them out to be cleaned
they were tan boots and had never been varnished
that was why i put them out
then i understand that on your arrival in london yesterday you went out at once and bought a pair of boots
i did a good deal of shopping
dr
mortimer here went round with me
you see if i am to be squire down there i must dress the part and it may be that i have got a little careless in my ways out west
among other things i bought these brown boots gave six dollars for them and had one stolen before ever i had them on my feet
it seems a singularly useless thing to steal said sherlock holmes
i confess that i share dr
mortimer's belief that it will not be long before the missing boot is found
and now gentlemen said the baronet with decision it seems to me that i have spoken quite enough about the little that i know
it is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full account of what we are all driving at
your request is a very reasonable one holmes answered
dr
mortimer i think you could not do better than to tell your story as you told it to us
thus encouraged our scientific friend drew his papers from his pocket and presented the whole case as he had done upon the morning before
sir henry baskerville listened with the deepest attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise
well i seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance said he when the long narrative was finished
of course i've heard of the hound ever since i was in the nursery
it's the pet story of the family though i never thought of taking it seriously before
but as to my uncle's death well it all seems boiling up in my head and i can't get it clear yet
you don't seem quite to have made up your mind whether it's a case for a policeman or a clergyman
precisely
and now there's this affair of the letter to me at the hotel
i suppose that fits into its place
it seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what goes on upon the moor said dr
mortimer
and also said holmes that someone is not ill disposed towards you since they warn you of danger
or it may be that they wish for their own purposes to scare me away
well of course that is possible also
i am very much indebted to you dr
mortimer for introducing me to a problem which presents several interesting alternatives
but the practical point which we now have to decide sir henry is whether it is or is not advisable for you to go to baskerville hall
why should i not go
there seems to be danger
do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger from human beings
well that is what we have to find out
whichever it is my answer is fixed
there is no devil in hell mr
holmes and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to the home of my own people and you may take that to be my final answer
his dark brows knitted and his face flushed to a dusky red as he spoke
it was evident that the fiery temper of the baskervilles was not extinct in this their last representative
meanwhile said he i have hardly had time to think over all that you have told me
it's a big thing for a man to have to understand and to decide at one sitting
i should like to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind
now look here mr
holmes it's half past eleven now and i am going back right away to my hotel
suppose you and your friend dr
watson come round and lunch with us at two
i'll be able to tell you more clearly then how this thing strikes me
is that convenient to you watson
perfectly
then you may expect us
shall i have a cab called
i'd prefer to walk for this affair has flurried me rather
i'll join you in a walk with pleasure said his companion
then we meet again at two o'clock
au revoir and good morning
we heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of the front door
in an instant holmes had changed from the languid dreamer to the man of action
your hat and boots watson quick
not a moment to lose
he rushed into his room in his dressing gown and was back again in a few seconds in a frock coat
we hurried together down the stairs and into the street
dr
mortimer and baskerville were still visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of oxford street
shall i run on and stop them
not for the world my dear watson
i am perfectly satisfied with your company if you will tolerate mine
our friends are wise for it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk
he quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which divided us by about half
then still keeping a hundred yards behind we followed into oxford street and so down regent street
once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window upon which holmes did the same
an instant afterwards he gave a little cry of satisfaction and following the direction of his eager eyes i saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward again
there's our man watson
come along
we'll have a good look at him if we can do no more
at that instant i was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab
instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up something was screamed to the driver and the cab flew madly off down regent street
holmes looked eagerly round for another but no empty one was in sight
then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic but the start was too great and already the cab was out of sight
there now
said holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white with vexation from the tide of vehicles
was ever such bad luck and such bad management too
watson watson if you are an honest man you will record this also and set it against my successes
who was the man
i have not an idea
a spy
well it was evident from what we have heard that baskerville has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in town
how else could it be known so quickly that it was the northumberland hotel which he had chosen
if they had followed him the first day i argued that they would follow him also the second
you may have observed that i twice strolled over to the window while dr
mortimer was reading his legend
yes i remember
i was looking out for loiterers in the street but i saw none
we are dealing with a clever man watson
this matter cuts very deep and though i have not finally made up my mind whether it is a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us i am conscious always of power and design
when our friends left i at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their invisible attendant
so wily was he that he had not trusted himself upon foot but he had availed himself of a cab so that he could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice
his method had the additional advantage that if they were to take a cab he was all ready to follow them
it has however one obvious disadvantage
it puts him in the power of the cabman
exactly
what a pity we did not get the number
my dear watson clumsy as i have been you surely do not seriously imagine that i neglected to get the number
no
is our man
but that is no use to us for the moment
i fail to see how you could have done more
on observing the cab i should have instantly turned and walked in the other direction
i should then at my leisure have hired a second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance or better still have driven to the northumberland hotel and waited there
when our unknown had followed baskerville home we should have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and seeing where he made for
as it is by an indiscreet eagerness which was taken advantage of with extraordinary quickness and energy by our opponent we have betrayed ourselves and lost our man
we had been sauntering slowly down regent street during this conversation and dr
mortimer with his companion had long vanished in front of us
there is no object in our following them said holmes
the shadow has departed and will not return
we must see what further cards we have in our hands and play them with decision
could you swear to that man's face within the cab
i could swear only to the beard
and so could i from which i gather that in all probability it was a false one
a clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use for a beard save to conceal his features
come in here watson
he turned into one of the district messenger offices where he was warmly greeted by the manager
ah wilson i see you have not forgotten the little case in which i had the good fortune to help you
no sir indeed i have not
you saved my good name and perhaps my life
my dear fellow you exaggerate
i have some recollection wilson that you had among your boys a lad named cartwright who showed some ability during the investigation
yes sir he is still with us
could you ring him up thank you
and i should be glad to have change of this five pound note
a lad of fourteen with a bright keen face had obeyed the summons of the manager
he stood now gazing with great reverence at the famous detective
let me have the hotel directory said holmes
thank you
now cartwright there are the names of twenty three hotels here all in the immediate neighbourhood of charing cross
do you see
yes sir
you will visit each of these in turn
yes sir
you will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one shilling
here are twenty three shillings
yes sir
you will tell him that you want to see the waste paper of yesterday
you will say that an important telegram has miscarried and that you are looking for it
you understand
yes sir
but what you are really looking for is the centre page of the times with some holes cut in it with scissors
here is a copy of the times
it is this page
you could easily recognize it could you not
yes sir
in each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter to whom also you will give a shilling
here are twenty three shillings
you will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of the twenty three that the waste of the day before has been burned or removed
in the three other cases you will be shown a heap of paper and you will look for this page of the times among it
the odds are enormously against your finding it
there are ten shillings over in case of emergencies
let me have a report by wire at baker street before evening
and now watson it only remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman no
and then we will drop into one of the bond street picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the hotel
sherlock holmes had in a very remarkable degree the power of detaching his mind at will
for two hours the strange business in which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten and he was entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern belgian masters
he would talk of nothing but art of which he had the crudest ideas from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at the northumberland hotel
sir henry baskerville is upstairs expecting you said the clerk
he asked me to show you up at once when you came
have you any objection to my looking at your register
said holmes
not in the least
the book showed that two names had been added after that of baskerville
one was theophilus johnson and family of newcastle the other mrs
oldmore and maid of high lodge alton
surely that must be the same johnson whom i used to know said holmes to the porter
a lawyer is he not gray headed and walks with a limp
no sir this is mr
johnson the coal owner a very active gentleman not older than yourself
surely you are mistaken about his trade
no sir
he has used this hotel for many years and he is very well known to us
ah that settles it
mrs
oldmore too i seem to remember the name
excuse my curiosity but often in calling upon one friend one finds another
she is an invalid lady sir
her husband was once mayor of gloucester
she always comes to us when she is in town
thank you i am afraid i cannot claim her acquaintance
we have established a most important fact by these questions watson he continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together
we know now that the people who are so interested in our friend have not settled down in his own hotel
that means that while they are as we have seen very anxious to watch him they are equally anxious that he should not see them
now this is a most suggestive fact
what does it suggest
it suggests halloa my dear fellow what on earth is the matter
as we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against sir henry baskerville himself
his face was flushed with anger and he held an old and dusty boot in one of his hands
so furious was he that he was hardly articulate and when he did speak it was in a much broader and more western dialect than any which we had heard from him in the morning
seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel he cried
they'll find they've started in to monkey with the wrong man unless they are careful
by thunder if that chap can't find my missing boot there will be trouble
i can take a joke with the best mr
holmes but they've got a bit over the mark this time
still looking for your boot
yes sir and mean to find it
but surely you said that it was a new brown boot
so it was sir
and now it's an old black one
what
you don't mean to say
that's just what i do mean to say
i only had three pairs in the world the new brown the old black and the patent leathers which i am wearing
last night they took one of my brown ones and today they have sneaked one of the black
well have you got it
speak out man and don't stand staring
an agitated german waiter had appeared upon the scene
no sir i have made inquiry all over the hotel but i can hear no word of it
well either that boot comes back before sundown or i'll see the manager and tell him that i go right straight out of this hotel
it shall be found sir i promise you that if you will have a little patience it will be found
mind it is for it's the last thing of mine that i'll lose in this den of thieves
well well mr
holmes you'll excuse my troubling you about such a trifle i think it's well worth troubling about
why you look very serious over it
how do you explain it
i just don't attempt to explain it
it seems the very maddest queerest thing that ever happened to me
the queerest perhaps said holmes thoughtfully
what do you make of it yourself
well i don't profess to understand it yet
this case of yours is very complex sir henry
when taken in conjunction with your uncle's death i am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of capital importance which i have handled there is one which cuts so deep
but we hold several threads in our hands and the odds are that one or other of them guides us to the truth
we may waste time in following the wrong one but sooner or later we must come upon the right
we had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the business which had brought us together
it was in the private sitting room to which we afterwards repaired that holmes asked baskerville what were his intentions
to go to baskerville hall
and when
at the end of the week
on the whole said holmes i think that your decision is a wise one
i have ample evidence that you are being dogged in london and amid the millions of this great city it is difficult to discover who these people are or what their object can be
if their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief and we should be powerless to prevent it
you did not know dr
mortimer that you were followed this morning from my house
dr
mortimer started violently
followed
by whom
that unfortunately is what i cannot tell you
have you among your neighbours or acquaintances on dartmoor any man with a black full beard
no or let me see why yes
barrymore sir charles's butler is a man with a full black beard
ha
where is barrymore
he is in charge of the hall
we had best ascertain if he is really there or if by any possibility he might be in london
how can you do that
give me a telegraph form
'is all ready for sir henry '
that will do
address to mr
barrymore baskerville hall
what is the nearest telegraph office
grimpen
very good we will send a second wire to the postmaster grimpen 'telegram to mr
barrymore to be delivered into his own hand
if absent please return wire to sir henry baskerville northumberland hotel '
that should let us know before evening whether barrymore is at his post in devonshire or not
that's so said baskerville
by the way dr
mortimer who is this barrymore anyhow
he is the son of the old caretaker who is dead
they have looked after the hall for four generations now
so far as i know he and his wife are as respectable a couple as any in the county
at the same time said baskerville it's clear enough that so long as there are none of the family at the hall these people have a mighty fine home and nothing to do
that is true
did barrymore profit at all by sir charles's will
asked holmes
he and his wife had five hundred pounds each
ha
did they know that they would receive this
yes sir charles was very fond of talking about the provisions of his will
that is very interesting
i hope said dr
mortimer that you do not look with suspicious eyes upon everyone who received a legacy from sir charles for i also had a thousand pounds left to me
indeed
and anyone else
there were many insignificant sums to individuals and a large number of public charities
the residue all went to sir henry
and how much was the residue
seven hundred and forty thousand pounds
holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise
i had no idea that so gigantic a sum was involved said he
sir charles had the reputation of being rich but we did not know how very rich he was until we came to examine his securities
the total value of the estate was close on to a million
dear me
it is a stake for which a man might well play a desperate game
and one more question dr
mortimer
supposing that anything happened to our young friend here you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis who would inherit the estate
since rodger baskerville sir charles's younger brother died unmarried the estate would descend to the desmonds who are distant cousins
james desmond is an elderly clergyman in westmoreland
thank you
these details are all of great interest
have you met mr
james desmond
yes he once came down to visit sir charles
he is a man of venerable appearance and of saintly life
i remember that he refused to accept any settlement from sir charles though he pressed it upon him
and this man of simple tastes would be the heir to sir charles's thousands
he would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed
he would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed otherwise by the present owner who can of course do what he likes with it
and have you made your will sir henry
no mr
holmes i have not
i've had no time for it was only yesterday that i learned how matters stood
but in any case i feel that the money should go with the title and estate
that was my poor uncle's idea
how is the owner going to restore the glories of the baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep up the property
house land and dollars must go together
quite so
well sir henry i am of one mind with you as to the advisability of your going down to devonshire without delay
there is only one provision which i must make
you certainly must not go alone
dr
mortimer returns with me
but dr
mortimer has his practice to attend to and his house is miles away from yours
with all the goodwill in the world he may be unable to help you
no sir henry you must take with you someone a trusty man who will be always by your side
is it possible that you could come yourself mr
holmes
if matters came to a crisis i should endeavour to be present in person but you can understand that with my extensive consulting practice and with the constant appeals which reach me from many quarters it is impossible for me to be absent from london for an indefinite time
at the present instant one of the most revered names in england is being besmirched by a blackmailer and only i can stop a disastrous scandal
you will see how impossible it is for me to go to dartmoor
whom would you recommend then
holmes laid his hand upon my arm
if my friend would undertake it there is no man who is better worth having at your side when you are in a tight place
no one can say so more confidently than i
the proposition took me completely by surprise but before i had time to answer baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it heartily
well now that is real kind of you dr
watson said he
you see how it is with me and you know just as much about the matter as i do
if you will come down to baskerville hall and see me through i'll never forget it
the promise of adventure had always a fascination for me and i was complimented by the words of holmes and by the eagerness with which the baronet hailed me as a companion
i will come with pleasure said i
i do not know how i could employ my time better
and you will report very carefully to me said holmes
when a crisis comes as it will do i will direct how you shall act
i suppose that by saturday all might be ready
would that suit dr
watson
perfectly
then on saturday unless you hear to the contrary we shall meet at the ten thirty train from paddington
we had risen to depart when baskerville gave a cry of triumph and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown boot from under a cabinet
my missing boot
he cried
may all our difficulties vanish as easily
said sherlock holmes
but it is a very singular thing dr
mortimer remarked
i searched this room carefully before lunch
and so did i said baskerville
every inch of it
there was certainly no boot in it then
in that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were lunching
the german was sent for but professed to know nothing of the matter nor could any inquiry clear it up
another item had been added to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small mysteries which had succeeded each other so rapidly
setting aside the whole grim story of sir charles's death we had a line of inexplicable incidents all within the limits of two days which included the receipt of the printed letter the black bearded spy in the hansom the loss of the new brown boot the loss of the old black boot and now the return of the new brown boot
holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to baker street and i knew from his drawn brows and keen face that his mind like my own was busy in endeavouring to frame some scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnected episodes could be fitted
all afternoon and late into the evening he sat lost in tobacco and thought
just before dinner two telegrams were handed in
the first ran have just heard that barrymore is at the hall
baskerville
the second visited twenty three hotels as directed but sorry to report unable to trace cut sheet of times
cartwright
there go two of my threads watson
there is nothing more stimulating than a case where everything goes against you
we must cast round for another scent
we have still the cabman who drove the spy
exactly
i have wired to get his name and address from the official registry
i should not be surprised if this were an answer to my question
the ring at the bell proved to be something even more satisfactory than an answer however for the door opened and a rough looking fellow entered who was evidently the man himself
i got a message from the head office that a gent at this address had been inquiring for no
said he
i've driven my cab this seven years and never a word of complaint
i came here straight from the yard to ask you to your face what you had against me
i have nothing in the world against you my good man said holmes
on the contrary i have half a sovereign for you if you will give me a clear answer to my questions
well i've had a good day and no mistake said the cabman with a grin
what was it you wanted to ask sir
first of all your name and address in case i want you again
john clayton turpey street the borough
my cab is out of shipley's yard near waterloo station
sherlock holmes made a note of it
now clayton tell me all about the fare who came and watched this house at ten o'clock this morning and afterwards followed the two gentlemen down regent street
the man looked surprised and a little embarrassed
why there's no good my telling you things for you seem to know as much as i do already said he
the truth is that the gentleman told me that he was a detective and that i was to say nothing about him to anyone
my good fellow this is a very serious business and you may find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide anything from me
you say that your fare told you that he was a detective
yes he did
when did he say this
when he left me
did he say anything more
he mentioned his name
holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me
oh he mentioned his name did he
that was imprudent
what was the name that he mentioned
his name said the cabman was mr
sherlock holmes
never have i seen my friend more completely taken aback than by the cabman's reply
for an instant he sat in silent amazement
then he burst into a hearty laugh
a touch watson an undeniable touch
said he
i feel a foil as quick and supple as my own
he got home upon me very prettily that time
so his name was sherlock holmes was it
yes sir that was the gentleman's name
excellent
tell me where you picked him up and all that occurred
he hailed me at half past nine in trafalgar square
he said that he was a detective and he offered me two guineas if i would do exactly what he wanted all day and ask no questions
i was glad enough to agree
first we drove down to the northumberland hotel and waited there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab from the rank
we followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near here
this very door said holmes
well i couldn't be sure of that but i dare say my fare knew all about it
we pulled up halfway down the street and waited an hour and a half
then the two gentlemen passed us walking and we followed down baker street and along i know said holmes
until we got three quarters down regent street
then my gentleman threw up the trap and he cried that i should drive right away to waterloo station as hard as i could go
i whipped up the mare and we were there under the ten minutes
then he paid up his two guineas like a good one and away he went into the station
only just as he was leaving he turned round and he said 'it might interest you to know that you have been driving mr
sherlock holmes '
that's how i come to know the name
i see
and you saw no more of him
not after he went into the station
and how would you describe mr
sherlock holmes
the cabman scratched his head
well he wasn't altogether such an easy gentleman to describe
i'd put him at forty years of age and he was of a middle height two or three inches shorter than you sir
he was dressed like a toff and he had a black beard cut square at the end and a pale face
i don't know as i could say more than that
colour of his eyes
no i can't say that
nothing more that you can remember
no sir nothing
well then here is your half sovereign
there's another one waiting for you if you can bring any more information
good night
good night sir and thank you
john clayton departed chuckling and holmes turned to me with a shrug of his shoulders and a rueful smile
snap goes our third thread and we end where we began said he
the cunning rascal
he knew our number knew that sir henry baskerville had consulted me spotted who i was in regent street conjectured that i had got the number of the cab and would lay my hands on the driver and so sent back this audacious message
i tell you watson this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of our steel
i've been checkmated in london
i can only wish you better luck in devonshire
but i'm not easy in my mind about it
about what
about sending you
it's an ugly business watson an ugly dangerous business and the more i see of it the less i like it
yes my dear fellow you may laugh but i give you my word that i shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in baker street once more
sir henry baskerville and dr
mortimer were ready upon the appointed day and we started as arranged for devonshire
mr
sherlock holmes drove with me to the station and gave me his last parting injunctions and advice
i will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions watson said he i wish you simply to report facts in the fullest possible manner to me and you can leave me to do the theorizing
what sort of facts
i asked
anything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon the case and especially the relations between young baskerville and his neighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the death of sir charles
i have made some inquiries myself in the last few days but the results have i fear been negative
one thing only appears to be certain and that is that mr
james desmond who is the next heir is an elderly gentleman of a very amiable disposition so that this persecution does not arise from him
i really think that we may eliminate him entirely from our calculations
there remain the people who will actually surround sir henry baskerville upon the moor
would it not be well in the first place to get rid of this barrymore couple
by no means
you could not make a greater mistake
if they are innocent it would be a cruel injustice and if they are guilty we should be giving up all chance of bringing it home to them
no no we will preserve them upon our list of suspects
then there is a groom at the hall if i remember right
there are two moorland farmers
there is our friend dr
mortimer whom i believe to be entirely honest and there is his wife of whom we know nothing
there is this naturalist stapleton and there is his sister who is said to be a young lady of attractions
there is mr
frankland of lafter hall who is also an unknown factor and there are one or two other neighbours
these are the folk who must be your very special study
i will do my best
you have arms i suppose
yes i thought it as well to take them
most certainly
keep your revolver near you night and day and never relax your precautions
our friends had already secured a first class carriage and were waiting for us upon the platform
no we have no news of any kind said dr
mortimer in answer to my friend's questions
i can swear to one thing and that is that we have not been shadowed during the last two days
we have never gone out without keeping a sharp watch and no one could have escaped our notice
you have always kept together i presume
except yesterday afternoon
i usually give up one day to pure amusement when i come to town so i spent it at the museum of the college of surgeons
and i went to look at the folk in the park said baskerville
but we had no trouble of any kind
it was imprudent all the same said holmes shaking his head and looking very grave
i beg sir henry that you will not go about alone
some great misfortune will befall you if you do
did you get your other boot
no sir it is gone forever
indeed
that is very interesting
well good bye he added as the train began to glide down the platform
bear in mind sir henry one of the phrases in that queer old legend which dr
mortimer has read to us and avoid the moor in those hours of darkness when the powers of evil are exalted
i looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind and saw the tall austere figure of holmes standing motionless and gazing after us
the journey was a swift and pleasant one and i spent it in making the more intimate acquaintance of my two companions and in playing with dr
mortimer's spaniel
in a very few hours the brown earth had become ruddy the brick had changed to granite and red cows grazed in well hedged fields where the lush grasses and more luxuriant vegetation spoke of a richer if a damper climate
young baskerville stared eagerly out of the window and cried aloud with delight as he recognized the familiar features of the devon scenery
i've been over a good part of the world since i left it dr
watson said he but i have never seen a place to compare with it
i never saw a devonshire man who did not swear by his county i remarked
it depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the county said dr
mortimer
a glance at our friend here reveals the rounded head of the celt which carries inside it the celtic enthusiasm and power of attachment
poor sir charles's head was of a very rare type half gaelic half ivernian in its characteristics
but you were very young when you last saw baskerville hall were you not
i was a boy in my teens at the time of my father's death and had never seen the hall for he lived in a little cottage on the south coast
thence i went straight to a friend in america
i tell you it is all as new to me as it is to dr
watson and i'm as keen as possible to see the moor
are you
then your wish is easily granted for there is your first sight of the moor said dr
mortimer pointing out of the carriage window
over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood there rose in the distance a gray melancholy hill with a strange jagged summit dim and vague in the distance like some fantastic landscape in a dream
baskerville sat for a long time his eyes fixed upon it and i read upon his eager face how much it meant to him this first sight of that strange spot where the men of his blood had held sway so long and left their mark so deep
there he sat with his tweed suit and his american accent in the corner of a prosaic railway carriage and yet as i looked at his dark and expressive face i felt more than ever how true a descendant he was of that long line of high blooded fiery and masterful men
there were pride valour and strength in his thick brows his sensitive nostrils and his large hazel eyes
if on that forbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should lie before us this was at least a comrade for whom one might venture to take a risk with the certainty that he would bravely share it
the train pulled up at a small wayside station and we all descended
outside beyond the low white fence a wagonette with a pair of cobs was waiting
our coming was evidently a great event for station master and porters clustered round us to carry out our luggage
it was a sweet simple country spot but i was surprised to observe that by the gate there stood two soldierly men in dark uniforms who leaned upon their short rifles and glanced keenly at us as we passed
the coachman a hard faced gnarled little fellow saluted sir henry baskerville and in a few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad white road
rolling pasture lands curved upward on either side of us and old gabled houses peeped out from amid the thick green foliage but behind the peaceful and sunlit countryside there rose ever dark against the evening sky the long gloomy curve of the moor broken by the jagged and sinister hills
the wagonette swung round into a side road and we curved upward through deep lanes worn by centuries of wheels high banks on either side heavy with dripping moss and fleshy hart's tongue ferns
bronzing bracken and mottled bramble gleamed in the light of the sinking sun
still steadily rising we passed over a narrow granite bridge and skirted a noisy stream which gushed swiftly down foaming and roaring amid the gray boulders
both road and stream wound up through a valley dense with scrub oak and fir
at every turn baskerville gave an exclamation of delight looking eagerly about him and asking countless questions
to his eyes all seemed beautiful but to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon the countryside which bore so clearly the mark of the waning year
yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and fluttered down upon us as we passed
the rattle of our wheels died away as we drove through drifts of rotting vegetation sad gifts as it seemed to me for nature to throw before the carriage of the returning heir of the baskervilles
halloa
cried dr
mortimer what is this
a steep curve of heath clad land an outlying spur of the moor lay in front of us
on the summit hard and clear like an equestrian statue upon its pedestal was a mounted soldier dark and stern his rifle poised ready over his forearm
he was watching the road along which we travelled
what is this perkins
asked dr
mortimer
our driver half turned in his seat
there's a convict escaped from princetown sir
he's been out three days now and the warders watch every road and every station but they've had no sight of him yet
the farmers about here don't like it sir and that's a fact
well i understand that they get five pounds if they can give information
yes sir but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing compared to the chance of having your throat cut
you see it isn't like any ordinary convict
this is a man that would stick at nothing
who is he then
it is selden the notting hill murderer
i remembered the case well for it was one in which holmes had taken an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the crime and the wanton brutality which had marked all the actions of the assassin
the commutation of his death sentence had been due to some doubts as to his complete sanity so atrocious was his conduct
our wagonette had topped a rise and in front of us rose the huge expanse of the moor mottled with gnarled and craggy cairns and tors
a cold wind swept down from it and set us shivering
somewhere there on that desolate plain was lurking this fiendish man hiding in a burrow like a wild beast his heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast him out
it needed but this to complete the grim suggestiveness of the barren waste the chilling wind and the darkling sky
even baskerville fell silent and pulled his overcoat more closely around him
we had left the fertile country behind and beneath us
we looked back on it now the slanting rays of a low sun turning the streams to threads of gold and glowing on the red earth new turned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands
the road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder over huge russet and olive slopes sprinkled with giant boulders
now and then we passed a moorland cottage walled and roofed with stone with no creeper to break its harsh outline
suddenly we looked down into a cuplike depression patched with stunted oaks and firs which had been twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm
two high narrow towers rose over the trees
the driver pointed with his whip
baskerville hall said he
its master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks and shining eyes
a few minutes later we had reached the lodge gates a maze of fantastic tracery in wrought iron with weather bitten pillars on either side blotched with lichens and surmounted by the boars' heads of the baskervilles
the lodge was a ruin of black granite and bared ribs of rafters but facing it was a new building half constructed the first fruit of sir charles's south african gold
through the gateway we passed into the avenue where the wheels were again hushed amid the leaves and the old trees shot their branches in a sombre tunnel over our heads
baskerville shuddered as he looked up the long dark drive to where the house glimmered like a ghost at the farther end
was it here
he asked in a low voice
no no the yew alley is on the other side
the young heir glanced round with a gloomy face
it's no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in such a place as this said he
it's enough to scare any man
i'll have a row of electric lamps up here inside of six months and you won't know it again with a thousand candle power swan and edison right here in front of the hall door
the avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf and the house lay before us
in the fading light i could see that the centre was a heavy block of building from which a porch projected
the whole front was draped in ivy with a patch clipped bare here and there where a window or a coat of arms broke through the dark veil
from this central block rose the twin towers ancient crenelated and pierced with many loopholes
to right and left of the turrets were more modern wings of black granite
a dull light shone through heavy mullioned windows and from the high chimneys which rose from the steep high angled roof there sprang a single black column of smoke
welcome sir henry
welcome to baskerville hall
a tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the door of the wagonette
the figure of a woman was silhouetted against the yellow light of the hall
she came out and helped the man to hand down our bags
you don't mind my driving straight home sir henry
said dr
mortimer
my wife is expecting me
surely you will stay and have some dinner
no i must go
i shall probably find some work awaiting me
i would stay to show you over the house but barrymore will be a better guide than i good bye and never hesitate night or day to send for me if i can be of service
the wheels died away down the drive while sir henry and i turned into the hall and the door clanged heavily behind us
it was a fine apartment in which we found ourselves large lofty and heavily raftered with huge baulks of age blackened oak
in the great old fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a log fire crackled and snapped
sir henry and i held out our hands to it for we were numb from our long drive
then we gazed round us at the high thin window of old stained glass the oak panelling the stags' heads the coats of arms upon the walls all dim and sombre in the subdued light of the central lamp
it's just as i imagined it said sir henry
is it not the very picture of an old family home
to think that this should be the same hall in which for five hundred years my people have lived
it strikes me solemn to think of it
i saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed about him
the light beat upon him where he stood but long shadows trailed down the walls and hung like a black canopy above him
barrymore had returned from taking our luggage to our rooms
he stood in front of us now with the subdued manner of a well trained servant
he was a remarkable looking man tall handsome with a square black beard and pale distinguished features
would you wish dinner to be served at once sir
is it ready
in a very few minutes sir
you will find hot water in your rooms
my wife and i will be happy sir henry to stay with you until you have made your fresh arrangements but you will understand that under the new conditions this house will require a considerable staff
what new conditions
i only meant sir that sir charles led a very retired life and we were able to look after his wants
you would naturally wish to have more company and so you will need changes in your household
do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave
only when it is quite convenient to you sir
but your family have been with us for several generations have they not
i should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an old family connection
i seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler's white face
i feel that also sir and so does my wife
but to tell the truth sir we were both very much attached to sir charles and his death gave us a shock and made these surroundings very painful to us
i fear that we shall never again be easy in our minds at baskerville hall
but what do you intend to do
i have no doubt sir that we shall succeed in establishing ourselves in some business
sir charles's generosity has given us the means to do so
and now sir perhaps i had best show you to your rooms
a square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall approached by a double stair
from this central point two long corridors extended the whole length of the building from which all the bedrooms opened
my own was in the same wing as baskerville's and almost next door to it
these rooms appeared to be much more modern than the central part of the house and the bright paper and numerous candles did something to remove the sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind
but the dining room which opened out of the hall was a place of shadow and gloom
it was a long chamber with a step separating the dais where the family sat from the lower portion reserved for their dependents
at one end a minstrel's gallery overlooked it
black beams shot across above our heads with a smoke darkened ceiling beyond them
with rows of flaring torches to light it up and the colour and rude hilarity of an old time banquet it might have softened but now when two black clothed gentlemen sat in the little circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp one's voice became hushed and one's spirit subdued
a dim line of ancestors in every variety of dress from the elizabethan knight to the buck of the regency stared down upon us and daunted us by their silent company
we talked little and i for one was glad when the meal was over and we were able to retire into the modern billiard room and smoke a cigarette
my word it isn't a very cheerful place said sir henry
i suppose one can tone down to it but i feel a bit out of the picture at present
i don't wonder that my uncle got a little jumpy if he lived all alone in such a house as this
however if it suits you we will retire early tonight and perhaps things may seem more cheerful in the morning
i drew aside my curtains before i went to bed and looked out from my window
it opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of the hall door
beyond two copses of trees moaned and swung in a rising wind
a half moon broke through the rifts of racing clouds
in its cold light i saw beyond the trees a broken fringe of rocks and the long low curve of the melancholy moor
i closed the curtain feeling that my last impression was in keeping with the rest
and yet it was not quite the last
i found myself weary and yet wakeful tossing restlessly from side to side seeking for the sleep which would not come
far away a chiming clock struck out the quarters of the hours but otherwise a deathly silence lay upon the old house
and then suddenly in the very dead of the night there came a sound to my ears clear resonant and unmistakable
it was the sob of a woman the muffled strangling gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow
i sat up in bed and listened intently
the noise could not have been far away and was certainly in the house
for half an hour i waited with every nerve on the alert but there came no other sound save the chiming clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall
the fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface from our minds the grim and gray impression which had been left upon both of us by our first experience of baskerville hall
as sir henry and i sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through the high mullioned windows throwing watery patches of colour from the coats of arms which covered them
the dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays and it was hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom into our souls upon the evening before
i guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to blame
said the baronet
we were tired with our journey and chilled by our drive so we took a gray view of the place
now we are fresh and well so it is all cheerful once more
and yet it was not entirely a question of imagination i answered
did you for example happen to hear someone a woman i think sobbing in the night
that is curious for i did when i was half asleep fancy that i heard something of the sort
i waited quite a time but there was no more of it so i concluded that it was all a dream
i heard it distinctly and i am sure that it was really the sob of a woman
we must ask about this right away
he rang the bell and asked barrymore whether he could account for our experience
it seemed to me that the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler still as he listened to his master's question
there are only two women in the house sir henry he answered
one is the scullery maid who sleeps in the other wing
the other is my wife and i can answer for it that the sound could not have come from her
and yet he lied as he said it for it chanced that after breakfast i met mrs
barrymore in the long corridor with the sun full upon her face
she was a large impassive heavy featured woman with a stern set expression of mouth
but her telltale eyes were red and glanced at me from between swollen lids
it was she then who wept in the night and if she did so her husband must know it
yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery in declaring that it was not so
why had he done this
and why did she weep so bitterly
already round this pale faced handsome black bearded man there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery and of gloom
it was he who had been the first to discover the body of sir charles and we had only his word for all the circumstances which led up to the old man's death
was it possible that it was barrymore after all whom we had seen in the cab in regent street
the beard might well have been the same
the cabman had described a somewhat shorter man but such an impression might easily have been erroneous
how could i settle the point forever
obviously the first thing to do was to see the grimpen postmaster and find whether the test telegram had really been placed in barrymore's own hands
be the answer what it might i should at least have something to report to sherlock holmes
sir henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast so that the time was propitious for my excursion
it was a pleasant walk of four miles along the edge of the moor leading me at last to a small gray hamlet in which two larger buildings which proved to be the inn and the house of dr
mortimer stood high above the rest
the postmaster who was also the village grocer had a clear recollection of the telegram
certainly sir said he i had the telegram delivered to mr
barrymore exactly as directed
who delivered it
my boy here
james you delivered that telegram to mr
barrymore at the hall last week did you not
yes father i delivered it
into his own hands
i asked
well he was up in the loft at the time so that i could not put it into his own hands but i gave it into mrs
barrymore's hands and she promised to deliver it at once
did you see mr
barrymore
no sir i tell you he was in the loft
if you didn't see him how do you know he was in the loft
well surely his own wife ought to know where he is said the postmaster testily
didn't he get the telegram
if there is any mistake it is for mr
barrymore himself to complain
it seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther but it was clear that in spite of holmes's ruse we had no proof that barrymore had not been in london all the time
suppose that it were so suppose that the same man had been the last who had seen sir charles alive and the first to dog the new heir when he returned to england
what then
was he the agent of others or had he some sinister design of his own
what interest could he have in persecuting the baskerville family
i thought of the strange warning clipped out of the leading article of the times
was that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon counteracting his schemes
the only conceivable motive was that which had been suggested by sir henry that if the family could be scared away a comfortable and permanent home would be secured for the barrymores
but surely such an explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an invisible net round the young baronet
holmes himself had said that no more complex case had come to him in all the long series of his sensational investigations
i prayed as i walked back along the gray lonely road that my friend might soon be freed from his preoccupations and able to come down to take this heavy burden of responsibility from my shoulders
suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running feet behind me and by a voice which called me by name
i turned expecting to see dr
mortimer but to my surprise it was a stranger who was pursuing me
he was a small slim clean shaven prim faced man flaxen haired and leanjawed between thirty and forty years of age dressed in a gray suit and wearing a straw hat
a tin box for botanical specimens hung over his shoulder and he carried a green butterfly net in one of his hands
you will i am sure excuse my presumption dr
watson said he as he came panting up to where i stood
here on the moor we are homely folk and do not wait for formal introductions
you may possibly have heard my name from our mutual friend mortimer
i am stapleton of merripit house
your net and box would have told me as much said i for i knew that mr
stapleton was a naturalist
but how did you know me
i have been calling on mortimer and he pointed you out to me from the window of his surgery as you passed
as our road lay the same way i thought that i would overtake you and introduce myself
i trust that sir henry is none the worse for his journey
he is very well thank you
we were all rather afraid that after the sad death of sir charles the new baronet might refuse to live here
it is asking much of a wealthy man to come down and bury himself in a place of this kind but i need not tell you that it means a very great deal to the countryside
sir henry has i suppose no superstitious fears in the matter
i do not think that it is likely
of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the family
i have heard it
it is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here
any number of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a creature upon the moor
he spoke with a smile but i seemed to read in his eyes that he took the matter more seriously
the story took a great hold upon the imagination of sir charles and i have no doubt that it led to his tragic end
but how
his nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog might have had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart
i fancy that he really did see something of the kind upon that last night in the yew alley
i feared that some disaster might occur for i was very fond of the old man and i knew that his heart was weak
how did you know that
my friend mortimer told me
you think then that some dog pursued sir charles and that he died of fright in consequence
have you any better explanation
i have not come to any conclusion
has mr
sherlock holmes
the words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at the placid face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no surprise was intended
it is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you dr
watson said he
the records of your detective have reached us here and you could not celebrate him without being known yourself
when mortimer told me your name he could not deny your identity
if you are here then it follows that mr
sherlock holmes is interesting himself in the matter and i am naturally curious to know what view he may take
i am afraid that i cannot answer that question
may i ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself
he cannot leave town at present
he has other cases which engage his attention
what a pity
he might throw some light on that which is so dark to us
but as to your own researches if there is any possible way in which i can be of service to you i trust that you will command me
if i had any indication of the nature of your suspicions or how you propose to investigate the case i might perhaps even now give you some aid or advice
i assure you that i am simply here upon a visit to my friend sir henry and that i need no help of any kind
excellent
said stapleton
you are perfectly right to be wary and discreet
i am justly reproved for what i feel was an unjustifiable intrusion and i promise you that i will not mention the matter again
we had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the road and wound away across the moor
a steep boulder sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry
the face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff with ferns and brambles growing in its niches
from over a distant rise there floated a gray plume of smoke
a moderate walk along this moor path brings us to merripit house said he
perhaps you will spare an hour that i may have the pleasure of introducing you to my sister
my first thought was that i should be by sir henry's side
but then i remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his study table was littered
it was certain that i could not help with those
and holmes had expressly said that i should study the neighbours upon the moor
i accepted stapleton's invitation and we turned together down the path
it is a wonderful place the moor said he looking round over the undulating downs long green rollers with crests of jagged granite foaming up into fantastic surges
you never tire of the moor
you cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains
it is so vast and so barren and so mysterious
you know it well then
i have only been here two years
the residents would call me a newcomer
we came shortly after sir charles settled
but my tastes led me to explore every part of the country round and i should think that there are few men who know it better than i do
is it hard to know
very hard
you see for example this great plain to the north here with the queer hills breaking out of it
do you observe anything remarkable about that
it would be a rare place for a gallop
you would naturally think so and the thought has cost several their lives before now
you notice those bright green spots scattered thickly over it
yes they seem more fertile than the rest
stapleton laughed
that is the great grimpen mire said he
a false step yonder means death to man or beast
only yesterday i saw one of the moor ponies wander into it
he never came out
i saw his head for quite a long time craning out of the bog hole but it sucked him down at last
even in dry seasons it is a danger to cross it but after these autumn rains it is an awful place
and yet i can find my way to the very heart of it and return alive
by george there is another of those miserable ponies
something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges
then a long agonized writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful cry echoed over the moor
it turned me cold with horror but my companion's nerves seemed to be stronger than mine
it's gone
said he
the mire has him
two in two days and many more perhaps for they get in the way of going there in the dry weather and never know the difference until the mire has them in its clutches
it's a bad place the great grimpen mire
and you say you can penetrate it
yes there are one or two paths which a very active man can take
i have found them out
but why should you wish to go into so horrible a place
well you see the hills beyond
they are really islands cut off on all sides by the impassable mire which has crawled round them in the course of years
that is where the rare plants and the butterflies are if you have the wit to reach them
i shall try my luck some day
he looked at me with a surprised face
for god's sake put such an idea out of your mind said he
your blood would be upon my head
i assure you that there would not be the least chance of your coming back alive
it is only by remembering certain complex landmarks that i am able to do it
halloa
i cried
what is that
a long low moan indescribably sad swept over the moor
it filled the whole air and yet it was impossible to say whence it came
from a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar and then sank back into a melancholy throbbing murmur once again
stapleton looked at me with a curious expression in his face
queer place the moor
said he
but what is it
the peasants say it is the hound of the baskervilles calling for its prey
i've heard it once or twice before but never quite so loud
i looked round with a chill of fear in my heart at the huge swelling plain mottled with the green patches of rushes
nothing stirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens which croaked loudly from a tor behind us
you are an educated man
you don't believe such nonsense as that
said i
what do you think is the cause of so strange a sound
bogs make queer noises sometimes
it's the mud settling or the water rising or something
no no that was a living voice
well perhaps it was
did you ever hear a bittern booming
no i never did
it's a very rare bird practically extinct in england now but all things are possible upon the moor
yes i should not be surprised to learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last of the bitterns
it's the weirdest strangest thing that ever i heard in my life
yes it's rather an uncanny place altogether
look at the hillside yonder
what do you make of those
the whole steep slope was covered with gray circular rings of stone a score of them at least
what are they
sheep pens
no they are the homes of our worthy ancestors
prehistoric man lived thickly on the moor and as no one in particular has lived there since we find all his little arrangements exactly as he left them
these are his wigwams with the roofs off
you can even see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go inside
but it is quite a town
when was it inhabited
neolithic man no date
what did he do
he grazed his cattle on these slopes and he learned to dig for tin when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe
look at the great trench in the opposite hill
that is his mark
yes you will find some very singular points about the moor dr
watson
oh excuse me an instant
it is surely cyclopides
a small fly or moth had fluttered across our path and in an instant stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it
to my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire and my acquaintance never paused for an instant bounding from tuft to tuft behind it his green net waving in the air
his gray clothes and jerky zigzag irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself
i was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous mire when i heard the sound of steps and turning round found a woman near me upon the path
she had come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of merripit house but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close
i could not doubt that this was the miss stapleton of whom i had been told since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor and i remembered that i had heard someone describe her as being a beauty
the woman who approached me was certainly that and of a most uncommon type
there could not have been a greater contrast between brother and sister for stapleton was neutral tinted with light hair and gray eyes while she was darker than any brunette whom i have seen in england slim elegant and tall
she had a proud finely cut face so regular that it might have seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the beautiful dark eager eyes
with her perfect figure and elegant dress she was indeed a strange apparition upon a lonely moorland path
her eyes were on her brother as i turned and then she quickened her pace towards me
i had raised my hat and was about to make some explanatory remark when her own words turned all my thoughts into a new channel
go back
she said
go straight back to london instantly
i could only stare at her in stupid surprise
her eyes blazed at me and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot
why should i go back
i asked
i cannot explain
she spoke in a low eager voice with a curious lisp in her utterance
but for god's sake do what i ask you
go back and never set foot upon the moor again
but i have only just come
man man
she cried
can you not tell when a warning is for your own good
go back to london
start tonight
get away from this place at all costs
hush my brother is coming
not a word of what i have said
would you mind getting that orchid for me among the mare's tails yonder
we are very rich in orchids on the moor though of course you are rather late to see the beauties of the place
stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing hard and flushed with his exertions
halloa beryl
said he and it seemed to me that the tone of his greeting was not altogether a cordial one
well jack you are very hot
yes i was chasing a cyclopides
he is very rare and seldom found in the late autumn
what a pity that i should have missed him
he spoke unconcernedly but his small light eyes glanced incessantly from the girl to me
you have introduced yourselves i can see
yes
i was telling sir henry that it was rather late for him to see the true beauties of the moor
why who do you think this is
i imagine that it must be sir henry baskerville
no no said i
only a humble commoner but his friend
my name is dr
watson
a flush of vexation passed over her expressive face
we have been talking at cross purposes said she
why you had not very much time for talk her brother remarked with the same questioning eyes
i talked as if dr
watson were a resident instead of being merely a visitor said she
it cannot much matter to him whether it is early or late for the orchids
but you will come on will you not and see merripit house
a short walk brought us to it a bleak moorland house once the farm of some grazier in the old prosperous days but now put into repair and turned into a modern dwelling
an orchard surrounded it but the trees as is usual upon the moor were stunted and nipped and the effect of the whole place was mean and melancholy
we were admitted by a strange wizened rusty coated old manservant who seemed in keeping with the house
inside however there were large rooms furnished with an elegance in which i seemed to recognize the taste of the lady
as i looked from their windows at the interminable granite flecked moor rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon i could not but marvel at what could have brought this highly educated man and this beautiful woman to live in such a place
queer spot to choose is it not
said he as if in answer to my thought
and yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy do we not beryl
quite happy said she but there was no ring of conviction in her words
i had a school said stapleton
it was in the north country
the work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting but the privilege of living with youth of helping to mould those young minds and of impressing them with one's own character and ideals was very dear to me
however the fates were against us
a serious epidemic broke out in the school and three of the boys died
it never recovered from the blow and much of my capital was irretrievably swallowed up
and yet if it were not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys i could rejoice over my own misfortune for with my strong tastes for botany and zoology i find an unlimited field of work here and my sister is as devoted to nature as i am
all this dr
watson has been brought upon your head by your expression as you surveyed the moor out of our window
it certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dull less for you perhaps than for your sister
no no i am never dull said she quickly
we have books we have our studies and we have interesting neighbours
dr
mortimer is a most learned man in his own line
poor sir charles was also an admirable companion
we knew him well and miss him more than i can tell
do you think that i should intrude if i were to call this afternoon and make the acquaintance of sir henry
i am sure that he would be delighted
then perhaps you would mention that i propose to do so
we may in our humble way do something to make things more easy for him until he becomes accustomed to his new surroundings
will you come upstairs dr
watson and inspect my collection of lepidoptera
i think it is the most complete one in the south west of england
by the time that you have looked through them lunch will be almost ready
but i was eager to get back to my charge
the melancholy of the moor the death of the unfortunate pony the weird sound which had been associated with the grim legend of the baskervilles all these things tinged my thoughts with sadness
then on the top of these more or less vague impressions there had come the definite and distinct warning of miss stapleton delivered with such intense earnestness that i could not doubt that some grave and deep reason lay behind it
i resisted all pressure to stay for lunch and i set off at once upon my return journey taking the grass grown path by which we had come
it seems however that there must have been some short cut for those who knew it for before i had reached the road i was astounded to see miss stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side of the track
her face was beautifully flushed with her exertions and she held her hand to her side
i have run all the way in order to cut you off dr
watson said she
i had not even time to put on my hat
i must not stop or my brother may miss me
i wanted to say to you how sorry i am about the stupid mistake i made in thinking that you were sir henry
please forget the words i said which have no application whatever to you
but i can't forget them miss stapleton said i
i am sir henry's friend and his welfare is a very close concern of mine
tell me why it was that you were so eager that sir henry should return to london
a woman's whim dr
watson
when you know me better you will understand that i cannot always give reasons for what i say or do
no no
i remember the thrill in your voice
i remember the look in your eyes
please please be frank with me miss stapleton for ever since i have been here i have been conscious of shadows all round me
life has become like that great grimpen mire with little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track
tell me then what it was that you meant and i will promise to convey your warning to sir henry
an expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her face but her eyes had hardened again when she answered me
you make too much of it dr
watson said she
my brother and i were very much shocked by the death of sir charles
we knew him very intimately for his favourite walk was over the moor to our house
he was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the family and when this tragedy came i naturally felt that there must be some grounds for the fears which he had expressed
i was distressed therefore when another member of the family came down to live here and i felt that he should be warned of the danger which he will run
that was all which i intended to convey
but what is the danger
you know the story of the hound
i do not believe in such nonsense
but i do
if you have any influence with sir henry take him away from a place which has always been fatal to his family
the world is wide
why should he wish to live at the place of danger
because it is the place of danger
that is sir henry's nature
i fear that unless you can give me some more definite information than this it would be impossible to get him to move
i cannot say anything definite for i do not know anything definite
i would ask you one more question miss stapleton
if you meant no more than this when you first spoke to me why should you not wish your brother to overhear what you said
there is nothing to which he or anyone else could object
my brother is very anxious to have the hall inhabited for he thinks it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor
he would be very angry if he knew that i have said anything which might induce sir henry to go away
but i have done my duty now and i will say no more
i must go back or he will miss me and suspect that i have seen you
good bye
she turned and had disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered boulders while i with my soul full of vague fears pursued my way to baskerville hall
from this point onward i will follow the course of events by transcribing my own letters to mr
sherlock holmes which lie before me on the table
one page is missing but otherwise they are exactly as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the moment more accurately than my memory clear as it is upon these tragic events can possibly do
baskerville hall october 13th
my dear holmes my previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to date as to all that has occurred in this most god forsaken corner of the world
the longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul its vastness and also its grim charm
when you are once out upon its bosom you have left all traces of modern england behind you but on the other hand you are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of the prehistoric people
on all sides of you as you walk are the houses of these forgotten folk with their graves and the huge monoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples
as you look at their gray stone huts against the scarred hillsides you leave your own age behind you and if you were to see a skin clad hairy man crawl out from the low door fitting a flint tipped arrow on to the string of his bow you would feel that his presence there was more natural than your own
the strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what must always have been most unfruitful soil
i am no antiquarian but i could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race who were forced to accept that which none other would occupy
all this however is foreign to the mission on which you sent me and will probably be very uninteresting to your severely practical mind
i can still remember your complete indifference as to whether the sun moved round the earth or the earth round the sun
let me therefore return to the facts concerning sir henry baskerville
if you have not had any report within the last few days it is because up to today there was nothing of importance to relate
then a very surprising circumstance occurred which i shall tell you in due course
but first of all i must keep you in touch with some of the other factors in the situation
one of these concerning which i have said little is the escaped convict upon the moor
there is strong reason now to believe that he has got right away which is a considerable relief to the lonely householders of this district
a fortnight has passed since his flight during which he has not been seen and nothing has been heard of him
it is surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon the moor during all that time
of course so far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all
any one of these stone huts would give him a hiding place
but there is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of the moor sheep
we think therefore that he has gone and the outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence
we are four able bodied men in this household so that we could take good care of ourselves but i confess that i have had uneasy moments when i have thought of the stapletons
they live miles from any help
there are one maid an old manservant the sister and the brother the latter not a very strong man
they would be helpless in the hands of a desperate fellow like this notting hill criminal if he could once effect an entrance
both sir henry and i were concerned at their situation and it was suggested that perkins the groom should go over to sleep there but stapleton would not hear of it
the fact is that our friend the baronet begins to display a considerable interest in our fair neighbour
it is not to be wondered at for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like him and she is a very fascinating and beautiful woman
there is something tropical and exotic about her which forms a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother
yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires
he has certainly a very marked influence over her for i have seen her continually glance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what she said
i trust that he is kind to her
there is a dry glitter in his eyes and a firm set of his thin lips which goes with a positive and possibly a harsh nature
you would find him an interesting study
he came over to call upon baskerville on that first day and the very next morning he took us both to show us the spot where the legend of the wicked hugo is supposed to have had its origin
it was an excursion of some miles across the moor to a place which is so dismal that it might have suggested the story
we found a short valley between rugged tors which led to an open grassy space flecked over with the white cotton grass
in the middle of it rose two great stones worn and sharpened at the upper end until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some monstrous beast
in every way it corresponded with the scene of the old tragedy
sir henry was much interested and asked stapleton more than once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the interference of the supernatural in the affairs of men
he spoke lightly but it was evident that he was very much in earnest
stapleton was guarded in his replies but it was easy to see that he said less than he might and that he would not express his whole opinion out of consideration for the feelings of the baronet
he told us of similar cases where families had suffered from some evil influence and he left us with the impression that he shared the popular view upon the matter
on our way back we stayed for lunch at merripit house and it was there that sir henry made the acquaintance of miss stapleton
from the first moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly attracted by her and i am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual
he referred to her again and again on our walk home and since then hardly a day has passed that we have not seen something of the brother and sister
they dine here tonight and there is some talk of our going to them next week
one would imagine that such a match would be very welcome to stapleton and yet i have more than once caught a look of the strongest disapprobation in his face when sir henry has been paying some attention to his sister
he is much attached to her no doubt and would lead a lonely life without her but it would seem the height of selfishness if he were to stand in the way of her making so brilliant a marriage
yet i am certain that he does not wish their intimacy to ripen into love and i have several times observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from being tete a tete
by the way your instructions to me never to allow sir henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a love affair were to be added to our other difficulties
my popularity would soon suffer if i were to carry out your orders to the letter
the other day thursday to be more exact dr
mortimer lunched with us
he has been excavating a barrow at long down and has got a prehistoric skull which fills him with great joy
never was there such a single minded enthusiast as he
the stapletons came in afterwards and the good doctor took us all to the yew alley at sir henry's request to show us exactly how everything occurred upon that fatal night
it is a long dismal walk the yew alley between two high walls of clipped hedge with a narrow band of grass upon either side
at the far end is an old tumble down summer house
halfway down is the moor gate where the old gentleman left his cigar ash
it is a white wooden gate with a latch
beyond it lies the wide moor
i remembered your theory of the affair and tried to picture all that had occurred
as the old man stood there he saw something coming across the moor something which terrified him so that he lost his wits and ran and ran until he died of sheer horror and exhaustion
there was the long gloomy tunnel down which he fled
and from what
a sheep dog of the moor
or a spectral hound black silent and monstrous
was there a human agency in the matter
did the pale watchful barrymore know more than he cared to say
it was all dim and vague but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind it
one other neighbour i have met since i wrote last
this is mr
frankland of lafter hall who lives some four miles to the south of us
he is an elderly man red faced white haired and choleric
his passion is for the british law and he has spent a large fortune in litigation
he fights for the mere pleasure of fighting and is equally ready to take up either side of a question so that it is no wonder that he has found it a costly amusement
sometimes he will shut up a right of way and defy the parish to make him open it
at others he will with his own hands tear down some other man's gate and declare that a path has existed there from time immemorial defying the owner to prosecute him for trespass
he is learned in old manorial and communal rights and he applies his knowledge sometimes in favour of the villagers of fernworthy and sometimes against them so that he is periodically either carried in triumph down the village street or else burned in effigy according to his latest exploit
he is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his hands at present which will probably swallow up the remainder of his fortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the future
apart from the law he seems a kindly good natured person and i only mention him because you were particular that i should send some description of the people who surround us
he is curiously employed at present for being an amateur astronomer he has an excellent telescope with which he lies upon the roof of his own house and sweeps the moor all day in the hope of catching a glimpse of the escaped convict
if he would confine his energies to this all would be well but there are rumours that he intends to prosecute dr
mortimer for opening a grave without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up the neolithic skull in the barrow on long down
he helps to keep our lives from being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where it is badly needed
and now having brought you up to date in the escaped convict the stapletons dr
mortimer and frankland of lafter hall let me end on that which is most important and tell you more about the barrymores and especially about the surprising development of last night
first of all about the test telegram which you sent from london in order to make sure that barrymore was really here
i have already explained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that the test was worthless and that we have no proof one way or the other
i told sir henry how the matter stood and he at once in his downright fashion had barrymore up and asked him whether he had received the telegram himself
barrymore said that he had
did the boy deliver it into your own hands
asked sir henry
barrymore looked surprised and considered for a little time
no said he i was in the box room at the time and my wife brought it up to me
did you answer it yourself
no i told my wife what to answer and she went down to write it
in the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord
i could not quite understand the object of your questions this morning sir henry said he
i trust that they do not mean that i have done anything to forfeit your confidence
sir henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by giving him a considerable part of his old wardrobe the london outfit having now all arrived
mrs
barrymore is of interest to me
she is a heavy solid person very limited intensely respectable and inclined to be puritanical
you could hardly conceive a less emotional subject
yet i have told you how on the first night here i heard her sobbing bitterly and since then i have more than once observed traces of tears upon her face
some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her heart
sometimes i wonder if she has a guilty memory which haunts her and sometimes i suspect barrymore of being a domestic tyrant
i have always felt that there was something singular and questionable in this man's character but the adventure of last night brings all my suspicions to a head
and yet it may seem a small matter in itself
you are aware that i am not a very sound sleeper and since i have been on guard in this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever
last night about two in the morning i was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room
i rose opened my door and peeped out
a long black shadow was trailing down the corridor
it was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his hand
he was in shirt and trousers with no covering to his feet
i could merely see the outline but his height told me that it was barrymore
he walked very slowly and circumspectly and there was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance
i have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which runs round the hall but that it is resumed upon the farther side
i waited until he had passed out of sight and then i followed him
when i came round the balcony he had reached the end of the farther corridor and i could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he had entered one of the rooms
now all these rooms are unfurnished and unoccupied so that his expedition became more mysterious than ever
the light shone steadily as if he were standing motionless
i crept down the passage as noiselessly as i could and peeped round the corner of the door
barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the glass
his profile was half turned towards me and his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor
for some minutes he stood watching intently
then he gave a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light
instantly i made my way back to my room and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing once more upon their return journey
long afterwards when i had fallen into a light sleep i heard a key turn somewhere in a lock but i could not tell whence the sound came
what it all means i cannot guess but there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of
i do not trouble you with my theories for you asked me to furnish you only with facts
i have had a long talk with sir henry this morning and we have made a plan of campaign founded upon my observations of last night
i will not speak about it just now but it should make my next report interesting reading
baskerville hall oct
15th
my dear holmes if i was compelled to leave you without much news during the early days of my mission you must acknowledge that i am making up for lost time and that events are now crowding thick and fast upon us
in my last report i ended upon my top note with barrymore at the window and now i have quite a budget already which will unless i am much mistaken considerably surprise you
things have taken a turn which i could not have anticipated
in some ways they have within the last forty eight hours become much clearer and in some ways they have become more complicated
but i will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself
before breakfast on the morning following my adventure i went down the corridor and examined the room in which barrymore had been on the night before
the western window through which he had stared so intently has i noticed one peculiarity above all other windows in the house it commands the nearest outlook on to the moor
there is an opening between two trees which enables one from this point of view to look right down upon it while from all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse which can be obtained
it follows therefore that barrymore since only this window would serve the purpose must have been looking out for something or somebody upon the moor
the night was very dark so that i can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone
it had struck me that it was possible that some love intrigue was on foot
that would have accounted for his stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness of his wife
the man is a striking looking fellow very well equipped to steal the heart of a country girl so that this theory seemed to have something to support it
that opening of the door which i had heard after i had returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep some clandestine appointment
so i reasoned with myself in the morning and i tell you the direction of my suspicions however much the result may have shown that they were unfounded
but whatever the true explanation of barrymore's movements might be i felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself until i could explain them was more than i could bear
i had an interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast and i told him all that i had seen
he was less surprised than i had expected
i knew that barrymore walked about nights and i had a mind to speak to him about it said he
two or three times i have heard his steps in the passage coming and going just about the hour you name
perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular window i suggested
perhaps he does
if so we should be able to shadow him and see what it is that he is after
i wonder what your friend holmes would do if he were here
i believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest said i
he would follow barrymore and see what he did
then we shall do it together
but surely he would hear us
the man is rather deaf and in any case we must take our chance of that
we'll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he passes
sir henry rubbed his hands with pleasure and it was evident that he hailed the adventure as a relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor
the baronet has been in communication with the architect who prepared the plans for sir charles and with a contractor from london so that we may expect great changes to begin here soon
there have been decorators and furnishers up from plymouth and it is evident that our friend has large ideas and means to spare no pains or expense to restore the grandeur of his family
when the house is renovated and refurnished all that he will need will be a wife to make it complete
between ourselves there are pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is willing for i have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour miss stapleton
and yet the course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as one would under the circumstances expect
today for example its surface was broken by a very unexpected ripple which has caused our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance
after the conversation which i have quoted about barrymore sir henry put on his hat and prepared to go out
as a matter of course i did the same
what are you coming watson
he asked looking at me in a curious way
that depends on whether you are going on the moor said i
yes i am
well you know what my instructions are
i am sorry to intrude but you heard how earnestly holmes insisted that i should not leave you and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor
sir henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile
my dear fellow said he holmes with all his wisdom did not foresee some things which have happened since i have been on the moor
you understand me
i am sure that you are the last man in the world who would wish to be a spoil sport
i must go out alone
it put me in a most awkward position
i was at a loss what to say or what to do and before i had made up my mind he picked up his cane and was gone
but when i came to think the matter over my conscience reproached me bitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of my sight
i imagined what my feelings would be if i had to return to you and to confess that some misfortune had occurred through my disregard for your instructions
i assure you my cheeks flushed at the very thought
it might not even now be too late to overtake him so i set off at once in the direction of merripit house
i hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing anything of sir henry until i came to the point where the moor path branches off
there fearing that perhaps i had come in the wrong direction after all i mounted a hill from which i could command a view the same hill which is cut into the dark quarry
thence i saw him at once
he was on the moor path about a quarter of a mile off and a lady was by his side who could only be miss stapleton
it was clear that there was already an understanding between them and that they had met by appointment
they were walking slowly along in deep conversation and i saw her making quick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest in what she was saying while he listened intently and once or twice shook his head in strong dissent
i stood among the rocks watching them very much puzzled as to what i should do next
to follow them and break into their intimate conversation seemed to be an outrage and yet my clear duty was never for an instant to let him out of my sight
to act the spy upon a friend was a hateful task
still i could see no better course than to observe him from the hill and to clear my conscience by confessing to him afterwards what i had done
it is true that if any sudden danger had threatened him i was too far away to be of use and yet i am sure that you will agree with me that the position was very difficult and that there was nothing more which i could do
our friend sir henry and the lady had halted on the path and were standing deeply absorbed in their conversation when i was suddenly aware that i was not the only witness of their interview
a wisp of green floating in the air caught my eye and another glance showed me that it was carried on a stick by a man who was moving among the broken ground
it was stapleton with his butterfly net
he was very much closer to the pair than i was and he appeared to be moving in their direction
at this instant sir henry suddenly drew miss stapleton to his side
his arm was round her but it seemed to me that she was straining away from him with her face averted
he stooped his head to hers and she raised one hand as if in protest
next moment i saw them spring apart and turn hurriedly round
stapleton was the cause of the interruption
he was running wildly towards them his absurd net dangling behind him
he gesticulated and almost danced with excitement in front of the lovers
what the scene meant i could not imagine but it seemed to me that stapleton was abusing sir henry who offered explanations which became more angry as the other refused to accept them
the lady stood by in haughty silence
finally stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in a peremptory way to his sister who after an irresolute glance at sir henry walked off by the side of her brother
the naturalist's angry gestures showed that the lady was included in his displeasure
the baronet stood for a minute looking after them and then he walked slowly back the way that he had come his head hanging the very picture of dejection
what all this meant i could not imagine but i was deeply ashamed to have witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend's knowledge
i ran down the hill therefore and met the baronet at the bottom
his face was flushed with anger and his brows were wrinkled like one who is at his wit's ends what to do
halloa watson
where have you dropped from
said he
you don't mean to say that you came after me in spite of all
i explained everything to him how i had found it impossible to remain behind how i had followed him and how i had witnessed all that had occurred
for an instant his eyes blazed at me but my frankness disarmed his anger and he broke at last into a rather rueful laugh
you would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe place for a man to be private said he but by thunder the whole countryside seems to have been out to see me do my wooing and a mighty poor wooing at that
where had you engaged a seat
i was on that hill
quite in the back row eh
but her brother was well up to the front
did you see him come out on us
yes i did
did he ever strike you as being crazy this brother of hers
i can't say that he ever did
i dare say not
i always thought him sane enough until today but you can take it from me that either he or i ought to be in a straitjacket
what's the matter with me anyhow
you've lived near me for some weeks watson
tell me straight now
is there anything that would prevent me from making a good husband to a woman that i loved
i should say not
he can't object to my worldly position so it must be myself that he has this down on
what has he against me
i never hurt man or woman in my life that i know of
and yet he would not so much as let me touch the tips of her fingers
did he say so
that and a deal more
i tell you watson i've only known her these few weeks but from the first i just felt that she was made for me and she too she was happy when she was with me and that i'll swear
there's a light in a woman's eyes that speaks louder than words
but he has never let us get together and it was only today for the first time that i saw a chance of having a few words with her alone
she was glad to meet me but when she did it was not love that she would talk about and she wouldn't have let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it
she kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger and that she would never be happy until i had left it
i told her that since i had seen her i was in no hurry to leave it and that if she really wanted me to go the only way to work it was for her to arrange to go with me
with that i offered in as many words to marry her but before she could answer down came this brother of hers running at us with a face on him like a madman
he was just white with rage and those light eyes of his were blazing with fury
what was i doing with the lady
how dared i offer her attentions which were distasteful to her
did i think that because i was a baronet i could do what i liked
if he had not been her brother i should have known better how to answer him
as it was i told him that my feelings towards his sister were such as i was not ashamed of and that i hoped that she might honour me by becoming my wife
that seemed to make the matter no better so then i lost my temper too and i answered him rather more hotly than i should perhaps considering that she was standing by
so it ended by his going off with her as you saw and here am i as badly puzzled a man as any in this county
just tell me what it all means watson and i'll owe you more than ever i can hope to pay
i tried one or two explanations but indeed i was completely puzzled myself
our friend's title his fortune his age his character and his appearance are all in his favour and i know nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which runs in his family
that his advances should be rejected so brusquely without any reference to the lady's own wishes and that the lady should accept the situation without protest is very amazing
however our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from stapleton himself that very afternoon
he had come to offer apologies for his rudeness of the morning and after a long private interview with sir henry in his study the upshot of their conversation was that the breach is quite healed and that we are to dine at merripit house next friday as a sign of it
i don't say now that he isn't a crazy man said sir henry i can't forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning but i must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he has done
did he give any explanation of his conduct
his sister is everything in his life he says
that is natural enough and i am glad that he should understand her value
they have always been together and according to his account he has been a very lonely man with only her as a companion so that the thought of losing her was really terrible to him
he had not understood he said that i was becoming attached to her but when he saw with his own eyes that it was really so and that she might be taken away from him it gave him such a shock that for a time he was not responsible for what he said or did
he was very sorry for all that had passed and he recognized how foolish and how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life
if she had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like myself than to anyone else
but in any case it was a blow to him and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself to meet it
he would withdraw all opposition upon his part if i would promise for three months to let the matter rest and to be content with cultivating the lady's friendship during that time without claiming her love
this i promised and so the matter rests
so there is one of our small mysteries cleared up
it is something to have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we are floundering
we know now why stapleton looked with disfavour upon his sister's suitor even when that suitor was so eligible a one as sir henry
and now i pass on to another thread which i have extricated out of the tangled skein the mystery of the sobs in the night of the tear stained face of mrs
barrymore of the secret journey of the butler to the western lattice window
congratulate me my dear holmes and tell me that i have not disappointed you as an agent that you do not regret the confidence which you showed in me when you sent me down
all these things have by one night's work been thoroughly cleared
i have said by one night's work but in truth it was by two nights' work for on the first we drew entirely blank
i sat up with sir henry in his rooms until nearly three o'clock in the morning but no sound of any sort did we hear except the chiming clock upon the stairs
it was a most melancholy vigil and ended by each of us falling asleep in our chairs
fortunately we were not discouraged and we determined to try again
the next night we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes without making the least sound
it was incredible how slowly the hours crawled by and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of patient interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into which he hopes the game may wander
one struck and two and we had almost for the second time given it up in despair when in an instant we both sat bolt upright in our chairs with all our weary senses keenly on the alert once more
we had heard the creak of a step in the passage
very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the distance
then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out in pursuit
already our man had gone round the gallery and the corridor was all in darkness
softly we stole along until we had come into the other wing
we were just in time to catch a glimpse of the tall black bearded figure his shoulders rounded as he tiptoed down the passage
then he passed through the same door as before and the light of the candle framed it in the darkness and shot one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor
we shuffled cautiously towards it trying every plank before we dared to put our whole weight upon it
we had taken the precaution of leaving our boots behind us but even so the old boards snapped and creaked beneath our tread
sometimes it seemed impossible that he should fail to hear our approach
however the man is fortunately rather deaf and he was entirely preoccupied in that which he was doing
when at last we reached the door and peeped through we found him crouching at the window candle in hand his white intent face pressed against the pane exactly as i had seen him two nights before
we had arranged no plan of campaign but the baronet is a man to whom the most direct way is always the most natural
he walked into the room and as he did so barrymore sprang up from the window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood livid and trembling before us
his dark eyes glaring out of the white mask of his face were full of horror and astonishment as he gazed from sir henry to me
what are you doing here barrymore
nothing sir
his agitation was so great that he could hardly speak and the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his candle
it was the window sir
i go round at night to see that they are fastened
on the second floor
yes sir all the windows
look here barrymore said sir henry sternly we have made up our minds to have the truth out of you so it will save you trouble to tell it sooner rather than later
come now
no lies
what were you doing at that window
the fellow looked at us in a helpless way and he wrung his hands together like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and misery
i was doing no harm sir
i was holding a candle to the window
and why were you holding a candle to the window
don't ask me sir henry don't ask me
i give you my word sir that it is not my secret and that i cannot tell it
if it concerned no one but myself i would not try to keep it from you
a sudden idea occurred to me and i took the candle from the trembling hand of the butler
he must have been holding it as a signal said i
let us see if there is any answer
i held it as he had done and stared out into the darkness of the night
vaguely i could discern the black bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor for the moon was behind the clouds
and then i gave a cry of exultation for a tiny pinpoint of yellow light had suddenly transfixed the dark veil and glowed steadily in the centre of the black square framed by the window
there it is
i cried
no no sir it is nothing nothing at all
the butler broke in i assure you sir move your light across the window watson
cried the baronet
see the other moves also
now you rascal do you deny that it is a signal
come speak up
who is your confederate out yonder and what is this conspiracy that is going on
the man's face became openly defiant
it is my business and not yours
i will not tell
then you leave my employment right away
very good sir
if i must i must
and you go in disgrace
by thunder you may well be ashamed of yourself
your family has lived with mine for over a hundred years under this roof and here i find you deep in some dark plot against me
no no sir no not against you
it was a woman's voice and mrs
barrymore paler and more horror struck than her husband was standing at the door
her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt might have been comic were it not for the intensity of feeling upon her face
we have to go eliza
this is the end of it
you can pack our things said the butler
oh john john have i brought you to this
it is my doing sir henry all mine
he has done nothing except for my sake and because i asked him
speak out then
what does it mean
my unhappy brother is starving on the moor
we cannot let him perish at our very gates
the light is a signal to him that food is ready for him and his light out yonder is to show the spot to which to bring it
then your brother is the escaped convict sir selden the criminal
that's the truth sir said barrymore
i said that it was not my secret and that i could not tell it to you
but now you have heard it and you will see that if there was a plot it was not against you
this then was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at night and the light at the window
sir henry and i both stared at the woman in amazement
was it possible that this stolidly respectable person was of the same blood as one of the most notorious criminals in the country
yes sir my name was selden and he is my younger brother
we humoured him too much when he was a lad and gave him his own way in everything until he came to think that the world was made for his pleasure and that he could do what he liked in it
then as he grew older he met wicked companions and the devil entered into him until he broke my mother's heart and dragged our name in the dirt
from crime to crime he sank lower and lower until it is only the mercy of god which has snatched him from the scaffold but to me sir he was always the little curly headed boy that i had nursed and played with as an elder sister would
that was why he broke prison sir
he knew that i was here and that we could not refuse to help him
when he dragged himself here one night weary and starving with the warders hard at his heels what could we do
we took him in and fed him and cared for him
then you returned sir and my brother thought he would be safer on the moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry was over so he lay in hiding there
but every second night we made sure if he was still there by putting a light in the window and if there was an answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him
every day we hoped that he was gone but as long as he was there we could not desert him
that is the whole truth as i am an honest christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in the matter it does not lie with my husband but with me for whose sake he has done all that he has
the woman's words came with an intense earnestness which carried conviction with them
is this true barrymore
yes sir henry
every word of it
well i cannot blame you for standing by your own wife
forget what i have said
go to your room you two and we shall talk further about this matter in the morning
when they were gone we looked out of the window again
sir henry had flung it open and the cold night wind beat in upon our faces
far away in the black distance there still glowed that one tiny point of yellow light
i wonder he dares said sir henry
it may be so placed as to be only visible from here
very likely
how far do you think it is
out by the cleft tor i think
not more than a mile or two off
hardly that
well it cannot be far if barrymore had to carry out the food to it
and he is waiting this villain beside that candle
by thunder watson i am going out to take that man
the same thought had crossed my own mind
it was not as if the barrymores had taken us into their confidence
their secret had been forced from them
the man was a danger to the community an unmitigated scoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse
we were only doing our duty in taking this chance of putting him back where he could do no harm
with his brutal and violent nature others would have to pay the price if we held our hands
any night for example our neighbours the stapletons might be attacked by him and it may have been the thought of this which made sir henry so keen upon the adventure
i will come said i
then get your revolver and put on your boots
the sooner we start the better as the fellow may put out his light and be off
in five minutes we were outside the door starting upon our expedition
we hurried through the dark shrubbery amid the dull moaning of the autumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves
the night air was heavy with the smell of damp and decay
now and again the moon peeped out for an instant but clouds were driving over the face of the sky and just as we came out on the moor a thin rain began to fall
the light still burned steadily in front
are you armed
i asked
i have a hunting crop
we must close in on him rapidly for he is said to be a desperate fellow
we shall take him by surprise and have him at our mercy before he can resist
i say watson said the baronet what would holmes say to this
how about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil is exalted
as if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast gloom of the moor that strange cry which i had already heard upon the borders of the great grimpen mire
it came with the wind through the silence of the night a long deep mutter then a rising howl and then the sad moan in which it died away
again and again it sounded the whole air throbbing with it strident wild and menacing
the baronet caught my sleeve and his face glimmered white through the darkness
my god what's that watson
i don't know
it's a sound they have on the moor
i heard it once before
it died away and an absolute silence closed in upon us
we stood straining our ears but nothing came
watson said the baronet it was the cry of a hound
my blood ran cold in my veins for there was a break in his voice which told of the sudden horror which had seized him
what do they call this sound
he asked
who
the folk on the countryside
oh they are ignorant people
why should you mind what they call it
tell me watson
what do they say of it
i hesitated but could not escape the question
they say it is the cry of the hound of the baskervilles
he groaned and was silent for a few moments
a hound it was he said at last but it seemed to come from miles away over yonder i think
it was hard to say whence it came
it rose and fell with the wind
isn't that the direction of the great grimpen mire
yes it is
well it was up there
come now watson didn't you think yourself that it was the cry of a hound
i am not a child
you need not fear to speak the truth
stapleton was with me when i heard it last
he said that it might be the calling of a strange bird
no no it was a hound
my god can there be some truth in all these stories
is it possible that i am really in danger from so dark a cause
you don't believe it do you watson
no no
and yet it was one thing to laugh about it in london and it is another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear such a cry as that
and my uncle
there was the footprint of the hound beside him as he lay
it all fits together
i don't think that i am a coward watson but that sound seemed to freeze my very blood
feel my hand
it was as cold as a block of marble
you'll be all right tomorrow
i don't think i'll get that cry out of my head
what do you advise that we do now
shall we turn back
no by thunder we have come out to get our man and we will do it
we after the convict and a hell hound as likely as not after us
come on
we'll see it through if all the fiends of the pit were loose upon the moor
we stumbled slowly along in the darkness with the black loom of the craggy hills around us and the yellow speck of light burning steadily in front
there is nothing so deceptive as the distance of a light upon a pitch dark night and sometimes the glimmer seemed to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes it might have been within a few yards of us
but at last we could see whence it came and then we knew that we were indeed very close
a guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks which flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also to prevent it from being visible save in the direction of baskerville hall
a boulder of granite concealed our approach and crouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light
it was strange to see this single candle burning there in the middle of the moor with no sign of life near it just the one straight yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it
what shall we do now
whispered sir henry
wait here
he must be near his light
let us see if we can get a glimpse of him
the words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him
over the rocks in the crevice of which the candle burned there was thrust out an evil yellow face a terrible animal face all seamed and scored with vile passions
foul with mire with a bristling beard and hung with matted hair it might well have belonged to one of those old savages who dwelt in the burrows on the hillsides
the light beneath him was reflected in his small cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and left through the darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard the steps of the hunters
something had evidently aroused his suspicions
it may have been that barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to give or the fellow may have had some other reason for thinking that all was not well but i could read his fears upon his wicked face
any instant he might dash out the light and vanish in the darkness
i sprang forward therefore and sir henry did the same
at the same moment the convict screamed out a curse at us and hurled a rock which splintered up against the boulder which had sheltered us
i caught one glimpse of his short squat strongly built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run
at the same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds
we rushed over the brow of the hill and there was our man running with great speed down the other side springing over the stones in his way with the activity of a mountain goat
a lucky long shot of my revolver might have crippled him but i had brought it only to defend myself if attacked and not to shoot an unarmed man who was running away
we were both swift runners and in fairly good training but we soon found that we had no chance of overtaking him
we saw him for a long time in the moonlight until he was only a small speck moving swiftly among the boulders upon the side of a distant hill
we ran and ran until we were completely blown but the space between us grew ever wider
finally we stopped and sat panting on two rocks while we watched him disappearing in the distance
and it was at this moment that there occurred a most strange and unexpected thing
we had risen from our rocks and were turning to go home having abandoned the hopeless chase
the moon was low upon the right and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood up against the lower curve of its silver disc
there outlined as black as an ebony statue on that shining background i saw the figure of a man upon the tor
do not think that it was a delusion holmes
i assure you that i have never in my life seen anything more clearly
as far as i could judge the figure was that of a tall thin man
he stood with his legs a little separated his arms folded his head bowed as if he were brooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which lay before him
he might have been the very spirit of that terrible place
it was not the convict
this man was far from the place where the latter had disappeared
besides he was a much taller man
with a cry of surprise i pointed him out to the baronet but in the instant during which i had turned to grasp his arm the man was gone
there was the sharp pinnacle of granite still cutting the lower edge of the moon but its peak bore no trace of that silent and motionless figure
i wished to go in that direction and to search the tor but it was some distance away
the baronet's nerves were still quivering from that cry which recalled the dark story of his family and he was not in the mood for fresh adventures
he had not seen this lonely man upon the tor and could not feel the thrill which his strange presence and his commanding attitude had given to me
a warder no doubt said he
the moor has been thick with them since this fellow escaped
well perhaps his explanation may be the right one but i should like to have some further proof of it
today we mean to communicate to the princetown people where they should look for their missing man but it is hard lines that we have not actually had the triumph of bringing him back as our own prisoner
such are the adventures of last night and you must acknowledge my dear holmes that i have done you very well in the matter of a report
much of what i tell you is no doubt quite irrelevant but still i feel that it is best that i should let you have all the facts and leave you to select for yourself those which will be of most service to you in helping you to your conclusions
we are certainly making some progress
so far as the barrymores go we have found the motive of their actions and that has cleared up the situation very much
but the moor with its mysteries and its strange inhabitants remains as inscrutable as ever
perhaps in my next i may be able to throw some light upon this also
best of all would it be if you could come down to us
in any case you will hear from me again in the course of the next few days
so far i have been able to quote from the reports which i have forwarded during these early days to sherlock holmes
now however i have arrived at a point in my narrative where i am compelled to abandon this method and to trust once more to my recollections aided by the diary which i kept at the time
a few extracts from the latter will carry me on to those scenes which are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory
i proceed then from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the convict and our other strange experiences upon the moor
october 16th
a dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain
the house is banked in with rolling clouds which rise now and then to show the dreary curves of the moor with thin silver veins upon the sides of the hills and the distant boulders gleaming where the light strikes upon their wet faces
it is melancholy outside and in
the baronet is in a black reaction after the excitements of the night
i am conscious myself of a weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger ever present danger which is the more terrible because i am unable to define it
and have i not cause for such a feeling
consider the long sequence of incidents which have all pointed to some sinister influence which is at work around us
there is the death of the last occupant of the hall fulfilling so exactly the conditions of the family legend and there are the repeated reports from peasants of the appearance of a strange creature upon the moor
twice i have with my own ears heard the sound which resembled the distant baying of a hound
it is incredible impossible that it should really be outside the ordinary laws of nature
a spectral hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the air with its howling is surely not to be thought of
stapleton may fall in with such a superstition and mortimer also but if i have one quality upon earth it is common sense and nothing will persuade me to believe in such a thing
to do so would be to descend to the level of these poor peasants who are not content with a mere fiend dog but must needs describe him with hell fire shooting from his mouth and eyes
holmes would not listen to such fancies and i am his agent
but facts are facts and i have twice heard this crying upon the moor
suppose that there were really some huge hound loose upon it that would go far to explain everything
but where could such a hound lie concealed where did it get its food where did it come from how was it that no one saw it by day
it must be confessed that the natural explanation offers almost as many difficulties as the other
and always apart from the hound there is the fact of the human agency in london the man in the cab and the letter which warned sir henry against the moor
this at least was real but it might have been the work of a protecting friend as easily as of an enemy
where is that friend or enemy now
has he remained in london or has he followed us down here
could he could he be the stranger whom i saw upon the tor
it is true that i have had only the one glance at him and yet there are some things to which i am ready to swear
he is no one whom i have seen down here and i have now met all the neighbours
the figure was far taller than that of stapleton far thinner than that of frankland
barrymore it might possibly have been but we had left him behind us and i am certain that he could not have followed us
a stranger then is still dogging us just as a stranger dogged us in london
we have never shaken him off
if i could lay my hands upon that man then at last we might find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties
to this one purpose i must now devote all my energies
my first impulse was to tell sir henry all my plans
my second and wisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as possible to anyone
he is silent and distrait
his nerves have been strangely shaken by that sound upon the moor
i will say nothing to add to his anxieties but i will take my own steps to attain my own end
we had a small scene this morning after breakfast
barrymore asked leave to speak with sir henry and they were closeted in his study some little time
sitting in the billiard room i more than once heard the sound of voices raised and i had a pretty good idea what the point was which was under discussion
after a time the baronet opened his door and called for me
barrymore considers that he has a grievance he said
he thinks that it was unfair on our part to hunt his brother in law down when he of his own free will had told us the secret
the butler was standing very pale but very collected before us
i may have spoken too warmly sir said he and if i have i am sure that i beg your pardon
at the same time i was very much surprised when i heard you two gentlemen come back this morning and learned that you had been chasing selden
the poor fellow has enough to fight against without my putting more upon his track
if you had told us of your own free will it would have been a different thing said the baronet you only told us or rather your wife only told us when it was forced from you and you could not help yourself
i didn't think you would have taken advantage of it sir henry indeed i didn't
the man is a public danger
there are lonely houses scattered over the moor and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing
you only want to get a glimpse of his face to see that
look at mr
stapleton's house for example with no one but himself to defend it
there's no safety for anyone until he is under lock and key
he'll break into no house sir
i give you my solemn word upon that
but he will never trouble anyone in this country again
i assure you sir henry that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to south america
for god's sake sir i beg of you not to let the police know that he is still on the moor
they have given up the chase there and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for him
you can't tell on him without getting my wife and me into trouble
i beg you sir to say nothing to the police
what do you say watson
i shrugged my shoulders
if he were safely out of the country it would relieve the tax payer of a burden
but how about the chance of his holding someone up before he goes
he would not do anything so mad sir
we have provided him with all that he can want
to commit a crime would be to show where he was hiding
that is true said sir henry
well barrymore god bless you sir and thank you from my heart
it would have killed my poor wife had he been taken again
i guess we are aiding and abetting a felony watson
but after what we have heard i don't feel as if i could give the man up so there is an end of it
all right barrymore you can go
with a few broken words of gratitude the man turned but he hesitated and then came back
you've been so kind to us sir that i should like to do the best i can for you in return
i know something sir henry and perhaps i should have said it before but it was long after the inquest that i found it out
i've never breathed a word about it yet to mortal man
it's about poor sir charles's death
the baronet and i were both upon our feet
do you know how he died
no sir i don't know that
what then
i know why he was at the gate at that hour
it was to meet a woman
to meet a woman
he
yes sir
and the woman's name
i can't give you the name sir but i can give you the initials
her initials were l
l
how do you know this barrymore
well sir henry your uncle had a letter that morning
he had usually a great many letters for he was a public man and well known for his kind heart so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him
but that morning as it chanced there was only this one letter so i took the more notice of it
it was from coombe tracey and it was addressed in a woman's hand
well
well sir i thought no more of the matter and never would have done had it not been for my wife
only a few weeks ago she was cleaning out sir charles's study it had never been touched since his death and she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back of the grate
the greater part of it was charred to pieces but one little slip the end of a page hung together and the writing could still be read though it was gray on a black ground
it seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the letter and it said 'please please as you are a gentleman burn this letter and be at the gate by ten o clock
beneath it were signed the initials l
l
have you got that slip
no sir it crumbled all to bits after we moved it
had sir charles received any other letters in the same writing
well sir i took no particular notice of his letters
i should not have noticed this one only it happened to come alone
and you have no idea who l l
is
no sir
no more than you have
but i expect if we could lay our hands upon that lady we should know more about sir charles's death
i cannot understand barrymore how you came to conceal this important information
well sir it was immediately after that our own trouble came to us
and then again sir we were both of us very fond of sir charles as we well might be considering all that he has done for us
to rake this up couldn't help our poor master and it's well to go carefully when there's a lady in the case
even the best of us you thought it might injure his reputation
well sir i thought no good could come of it
but now you have been kind to us and i feel as if it would be treating you unfairly not to tell you all that i know about the matter
very good barrymore you can go
when the butler had left us sir henry turned to me
well watson what do you think of this new light
it seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before
so i think
but if we can only trace l l it should clear up the whole business
we have gained that much
we know that there is someone who has the facts if we can only find her
what do you think we should do
let holmes know all about it at once
it will give him the clue for which he has been seeking
i am much mistaken if it does not bring him down
i went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning's conversation for holmes
it was evident to me that he had been very busy of late for the notes which i had from baker street were few and short with no comments upon the information which i had supplied and hardly any reference to my mission
no doubt his blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties
and yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his interest
i wish that he were here
october 17th
all day today the rain poured down rustling on the ivy and dripping from the eaves
i thought of the convict out upon the bleak cold shelterless moor
poor devil
whatever his crimes he has suffered something to atone for them
and then i thought of that other one the face in the cab the figure against the moon
was he also out in that deluged the unseen watcher the man of darkness
in the evening i put on my waterproof and i walked far upon the sodden moor full of dark imaginings the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears
god help those who wander into the great mire now for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass
i found the black tor upon which i had seen the solitary watcher and from its craggy summit i looked out myself across the melancholy downs
rain squalls drifted across their russet face and the heavy slate coloured clouds hung low over the landscape trailing in gray wreaths down the sides of the fantastic hills
in the distant hollow on the left half hidden by the mist the two thin towers of baskerville hall rose above the trees
they were the only signs of human life which i could see save only those prehistoric huts which lay thickly upon the slopes of the hills
nowhere was there any trace of that lonely man whom i had seen on the same spot two nights before
as i walked back i was overtaken by dr
mortimer driving in his dog cart over a rough moorland track which led from the outlying farmhouse of foulmire
he has been very attentive to us and hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the hall to see how we were getting on
he insisted upon my climbing into his dog cart and he gave me a lift homeward
i found him much troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel
it had wandered on to the moor and had never come back
i gave him such consolation as i might but i thought of the pony on the grimpen mire and i do not fancy that he will see his little dog again
by the way mortimer said i as we jolted along the rough road i suppose there are few people living within driving distance of this whom you do not know
hardly any i think
can you then tell me the name of any woman whose initials are l
l
he thought for a few minutes
no said he
there are a few gipsies and labouring folk for whom i can't answer but among the farmers or gentry there is no one whose initials are those
wait a bit though he added after a pause
there is laura lyons her initials are l
l but she lives in coombe tracey
who is she
i asked
she is frankland's daughter
what
old frankland the crank
exactly
she married an artist named lyons who came sketching on the moor
he proved to be a blackguard and deserted her
the fault from what i hear may not have been entirely on one side
her father refused to have anything to do with her because she had married without his consent and perhaps for one or two other reasons as well
so between the old sinner and the young one the girl has had a pretty bad time
how does she live
i fancy old frankland allows her a pittance but it cannot be more for his own affairs are considerably involved
whatever she may have deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the bad
her story got about and several of the people here did something to enable her to earn an honest living
stapleton did for one and sir charles for another
i gave a trifle myself
it was to set her up in a typewriting business
he wanted to know the object of my inquiries but i managed to satisfy his curiosity without telling him too much for there is no reason why we should take anyone into our confidence
tomorrow morning i shall find my way to coombe tracey and if i can see this mrs
laura lyons of equivocal reputation a long step will have been made towards clearing one incident in this chain of mysteries
i am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent for when mortimer pressed his questions to an inconvenient extent i asked him casually to what type frankland's skull belonged and so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive
i have not lived for years with sherlock holmes for nothing
i have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and melancholy day
this was my conversation with barrymore just now which gives me one more strong card which i can play in due time
mortimer had stayed to dinner and he and the baronet played ecarte afterwards
the butler brought me my coffee into the library and i took the chance to ask him a few questions
well said i has this precious relation of yours departed or is he still lurking out yonder
i don't know sir
i hope to heaven that he has gone for he has brought nothing but trouble here
i've not heard of him since i left out food for him last and that was three days ago
did you see him then
no sir but the food was gone when next i went that way
then he was certainly there
so you would think sir unless it was the other man who took it
i sat with my coffee cup halfway to my lips and stared at barrymore
you know that there is another man then
yes sir there is another man upon the moor
have you seen him
no sir
how do you know of him then
selden told me of him sir a week ago or more
he's in hiding too but he's not a convict as far as i can make out
i don't like it dr
watson i tell you straight sir that i don't like it
he spoke with a sudden passion of earnestness
now listen to me barrymore
i have no interest in this matter but that of your master
i have come here with no object except to help him
tell me frankly what it is that you don't like
barrymore hesitated for a moment as if he regretted his outburst or found it difficult to express his own feelings in words
it's all these goings on sir he cried at last waving his hand towards the rain lashed window which faced the moor
there's foul play somewhere and there's black villainy brewing to that i'll swear
very glad i should be sir to see sir henry on his way back to london again
but what is it that alarms you
look at sir charles's death
that was bad enough for all that the coroner said
look at the noises on the moor at night
there's not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it
look at this stranger hiding out yonder and watching and waiting
what's he waiting for
what does it mean
it means no good to anyone of the name of baskerville and very glad i shall be to be quit of it all on the day that sir henry's new servants are ready to take over the hall
but about this stranger said i
can you tell me anything about him
what did selden say
did he find out where he hid or what he was doing
he saw him once or twice but he is a deep one and gives nothing away
at first he thought that he was the police but soon he found that he had some lay of his own
a kind of gentleman he was as far as he could see but what he was doing he could not make out
and where did he say that he lived
among the old houses on the hillside the stone huts where the old folk used to live
but how about his food
selden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and brings all he needs
i dare say he goes to coombe tracey for what he wants
very good barrymore
we may talk further of this some other time
when the butler had gone i walked over to the black window and i looked through a blurred pane at the driving clouds and at the tossing outline of the wind swept trees
it is a wild night indoors and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor
what passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in such a place at such a time
and what deep and earnest purpose can he have which calls for such a trial
there in that hut upon the moor seems to lie the very centre of that problem which has vexed me so sorely
i swear that another day shall not have passed before i have done all that man can do to reach the heart of the mystery
the extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter has brought my narrative up to the eighteenth of october a time when these strange events began to move swiftly towards their terrible conclusion
the incidents of the next few days are indelibly graven upon my recollection and i can tell them without reference to the notes made at the time
i start them from the day which succeeded that upon which i had established two facts of great importance the one that mrs
laura lyons of coombe tracey had written to sir charles baskerville and made an appointment with him at the very place and hour that he met his death the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be found among the stone huts upon the hillside
with these two facts in my possession i felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be deficient if i could not throw some further light upon these dark places
i had no opportunity to tell the baronet what i had learned about mrs
lyons upon the evening before for dr
mortimer remained with him at cards until it was very late
at breakfast however i informed him about my discovery and asked him whether he would care to accompany me to coombe tracey
at first he was very eager to come but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if i went alone the results might be better
the more formal we made the visit the less information we might obtain
i left sir henry behind therefore not without some prickings of conscience and drove off upon my new quest
when i reached coombe tracey i told perkins to put up the horses and i made inquiries for the lady whom i had come to interrogate
i had no difficulty in finding her rooms which were central and well appointed
a maid showed me in without ceremony and as i entered the sitting room a lady who was sitting before a remington typewriter sprang up with a pleasant smile of welcome
her face fell however when she saw that i was a stranger and she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit
the first impression left by mrs
lyons was one of extreme beauty
her eyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour and her cheeks though considerably freckled were flushed with the exquisite bloom of the brunette the dainty pink which lurks at the heart of the sulphur rose
admiration was i repeat the first impression
but the second was criticism
there was something subtly wrong with the face some coarseness of expression some hardness perhaps of eye some looseness of lip which marred its perfect beauty
but these of course are afterthoughts
at the moment i was simply conscious that i was in the presence of a very handsome woman and that she was asking me the reasons for my visit
i had not quite understood until that instant how delicate my mission was
i have the pleasure said i of knowing your father
it was a clumsy introduction and the lady made me feel it
there is nothing in common between my father and me she said
i owe him nothing and his friends are not mine
if it were not for the late sir charles baskerville and some other kind hearts i might have starved for all that my father cared
it was about the late sir charles baskerville that i have come here to see you
the freckles started out on the lady's face
what can i tell you about him
she asked and her fingers played nervously over the stops of her typewriter
you knew him did you not
i have already said that i owe a great deal to his kindness
if i am able to support myself it is largely due to the interest which he took in my unhappy situation
did you correspond with him
the lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes
what is the object of these questions
she asked sharply
the object is to avoid a public scandal
it is better that i should ask them here than that the matter should pass outside our control
she was silent and her face was still very pale
at last she looked up with something reckless and defiant in her manner
well i'll answer she said
what are your questions
did you correspond with sir charles
i certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his delicacy and his generosity
have you the dates of those letters
no
have you ever met him
yes once or twice when he came into coombe tracey
he was a very retiring man and he preferred to do good by stealth
but if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom how did he know enough about your affairs to be able to help you as you say that he has done
she met my difficulty with the utmost readiness
there were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united to help me
one was mr
stapleton a neighbour and intimate friend of sir charles's
he was exceedingly kind and it was through him that sir charles learned about my affairs
i knew already that sir charles baskerville had made stapleton his almoner upon several occasions so the lady's statement bore the impress of truth upon it
did you ever write to sir charles asking him to meet you
i continued
mrs
lyons flushed with anger again
really sir this is a very extraordinary question
i am sorry madam but i must repeat it
then i answer certainly not
not on the very day of sir charles's death
the flush had faded in an instant and a deathly face was before me
her dry lips could not speak the no which i saw rather than heard
surely your memory deceives you said i
i could even quote a passage of your letter
it ran 'please please as you are a gentleman burn this letter and be at the gate by ten o'clock '
i thought that she had fainted but she recovered herself by a supreme effort
is there no such thing as a gentleman
she gasped
you do sir charles an injustice
he did burn the letter
but sometimes a letter may be legible even when burned
you acknowledge now that you wrote it
yes i did write it she cried pouring out her soul in a torrent of words
i did write it
why should i deny it
i have no reason to be ashamed of it
i wished him to help me
i believed that if i had an interview i could gain his help so i asked him to meet me
but why at such an hour
because i had only just learned that he was going to london next day and might be away for months
there were reasons why i could not get there earlier
but why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the house
do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor's house
well what happened when you did get there
i never went
mrs
lyons
no i swear it to you on all i hold sacred
i never went
something intervened to prevent my going
what was that
that is a private matter
i cannot tell it
you acknowledge then that you made an appointment with sir charles at the very hour and place at which he met his death but you deny that you kept the appointment
that is the truth
again and again i cross questioned her but i could never get past that point
mrs
lyons said i as i rose from this long and inconclusive interview you are taking a very great responsibility and putting yourself in a very false position by not making an absolutely clean breast of all that you know
if i have to call in the aid of the police you will find how seriously you are compromised
if your position is innocent why did you in the first instance deny having written to sir charles upon that date
because i feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from it and that i might find myself involved in a scandal
and why were you so pressing that sir charles should destroy your letter
if you have read the letter you will know
i did not say that i had read all the letter
you quoted some of it
i quoted the postscript
the letter had as i said been burned and it was not all legible
i ask you once again why it was that you were so pressing that sir charles should destroy this letter which he received on the day of his death
the matter is a very private one
the more reason why you should avoid a public investigation
i will tell you then
if you have heard anything of my unhappy history you will know that i made a rash marriage and had reason to regret it
i have heard so much
my life has been one incessant persecution from a husband whom i abhor
the law is upon his side and every day i am faced by the possibility that he may force me to live with him
at the time that i wrote this letter to sir charles i had learned that there was a prospect of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met
it meant everything to me peace of mind happiness self respect everything
i knew sir charles's generosity and i thought that if he heard the story from my own lips he would help me
then how is it that you did not go
because i received help in the interval from another source
why then did you not write to sir charles and explain this
so i should have done had i not seen his death in the paper next morning
the woman's story hung coherently together and all my questions were unable to shake it
i could only check it by finding if she had indeed instituted divorce proceedings against her husband at or about the time of the tragedy
it was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not been to baskerville hall if she really had been for a trap would be necessary to take her there and could not have returned to coombe tracey until the early hours of the morning
such an excursion could not be kept secret
the probability was therefore that she was telling the truth or at least a part of the truth
i came away baffled and disheartened
once again i had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across every path by which i tried to get at the object of my mission
and yet the more i thought of the lady's face and of her manner the more i felt that something was being held back from me
why should she turn so pale
why should she fight against every admission until it was forced from her
why should she have been so reticent at the time of the tragedy
surely the explanation of all this could not be as innocent as she would have me believe
for the moment i could proceed no farther in that direction but must turn back to that other clue which was to be sought for among the stone huts upon the moor
and that was a most vague direction
i realized it as i drove back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people
barrymore's only indication had been that the stranger lived in one of these abandoned huts and many hundreds of them are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the moor
but i had my own experience for a guide since it had shown me the man himself standing upon the summit of the black tor
that then should be the centre of my search
from there i should explore every hut upon the moor until i lighted upon the right one
if this man were inside it i should find out from his own lips at the point of my revolver if necessary who he was and why he had dogged us so long
he might slip away from us in the crowd of regent street but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor
on the other hand if i should find the hut and its tenant should not be within it i must remain there however long the vigil until he returned
holmes had missed him in london
it would indeed be a triumph for me if i could run him to earth where my master had failed
luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry but now at last it came to my aid
and the messenger of good fortune was none other than mr
frankland who was standing gray whiskered and red faced outside the gate of his garden which opened on to the highroad along which i travelled
good day dr
watson cried he with unwonted good humour you must really give your horses a rest and come in to have a glass of wine and to congratulate me
my feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after what i had heard of his treatment of his daughter but i was anxious to send perkins and the wagonette home and the opportunity was a good one
i alighted and sent a message to sir henry that i should walk over in time for dinner
then i followed frankland into his dining room
it is a great day for me sir one of the red letter days of my life he cried with many chuckles
i have brought off a double event
i mean to teach them in these parts that law is law and that there is a man here who does not fear to invoke it
i have established a right of way through the centre of old middleton's park slap across it sir within a hundred yards of his own front door
what do you think of that
we'll teach these magnates that they cannot ride roughshod over the rights of the commoners confound them
and i've closed the wood where the fernworthy folk used to picnic
these infernal people seem to think that there are no rights of property and that they can swarm where they like with their papers and their bottles
both cases decided dr
watson and both in my favour
i haven't had such a day since i had sir john morland for trespass because he shot in his own warren
how on earth did you do that
look it up in the books sir
it will repay reading frankland v morland court of queen's bench
it cost me pounds but i got my verdict
did it do you any good
none sir none
i am proud to say that i had no interest in the matter
i act entirely from a sense of public duty
i have no doubt for example that the fernworthy people will burn me in effigy tonight
i told the police last time they did it that they should stop these disgraceful exhibitions
the county constabulary is in a scandalous state sir and it has not afforded me the protection to which i am entitled
the case of frankland v regina will bring the matter before the attention of the public
i told them that they would have occasion to regret their treatment of me and already my words have come true
how so
i asked
the old man put on a very knowing expression
because i could tell them what they are dying to know but nothing would induce me to help the rascals in any way
i had been casting round for some excuse by which i could get away from his gossip but now i began to wish to hear more of it
i had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong sign of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences
some poaching case no doubt
said i with an indifferent manner
ha ha my boy a very much more important matter than that
what about the convict on the moor
i stared
you don't mean that you know where he is
said i
i may not know exactly where he is but i am quite sure that i could help the police to lay their hands on him
has it never struck you that the way to catch that man was to find out where he got his food and so trace it to him
he certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth
no doubt said i but how do you know that he is anywhere upon the moor
i know it because i have seen with my own eyes the messenger who takes him his food
my heart sank for barrymore
it was a serious thing to be in the power of this spiteful old busybody
but his next remark took a weight from my mind
you'll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a child
i see him every day through my telescope upon the roof
he passes along the same path at the same hour and to whom should he be going except to the convict
here was luck indeed
and yet i suppressed all appearance of interest
a child
barrymore had said that our unknown was supplied by a boy
it was on his track and not upon the convict's that frankland had stumbled
if i could get his knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt
but incredulity and indifference were evidently my strongest cards
i should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of one of the moorland shepherds taking out his father's dinner
the least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old autocrat
his eyes looked malignantly at me and his gray whiskers bristled like those of an angry cat
indeed sir
said he pointing out over the wide stretching moor
do you see that black tor over yonder
well do you see the low hill beyond with the thornbush upon it
it is the stoniest part of the whole moor
is that a place where a shepherd would be likely to take his station
your suggestion sir is a most absurd one
i meekly answered that i had spoken without knowing all the facts
my submission pleased him and led him to further confidences
you may be sure sir that i have very good grounds before i come to an opinion
i have seen the boy again and again with his bundle
every day and sometimes twice a day i have been able but wait a moment dr
watson
do my eyes deceive me or is there at the present moment something moving upon that hillside
it was several miles off but i could distinctly see a small dark dot against the dull green and gray
come sir come
cried frankland rushing upstairs
you will see with your own eyes and judge for yourself
the telescope a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod stood upon the flat leads of the house
frankland clapped his eye to it and gave a cry of satisfaction
quick dr
watson quick before he passes over the hill
there he was sure enough a small urchin with a little bundle upon his shoulder toiling slowly up the hill
when he reached the crest i saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue sky
he looked round him with a furtive and stealthy air as one who dreads pursuit
then he vanished over the hill
well
am i right
certainly there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand
and what the errand is even a county constable could guess
but not one word shall they have from me and i bind you to secrecy also dr
watson
not a word
you understand
just as you wish
they have treated me shamefully shamefully
when the facts come out in frankland v regina i venture to think that a thrill of indignation will run through the country
nothing would induce me to help the police in any way
for all they cared it might have been me instead of my effigy which these rascals burned at the stake
surely you are not going
you will help me to empty the decanter in honour of this great occasion
but i resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading him from his announced intention of walking home with me
i kept the road as long as his eye was on me and then i struck off across the moor and made for the stony hill over which the boy had disappeared
everything was working in my favour and i swore that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that i should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way
the sun was already sinking when i reached the summit of the hill and the long slopes beneath me were all golden green on one side and gray shadow on the other
a haze lay low upon the farthest sky line out of which jutted the fantastic shapes of belliver and vixen tor
over the wide expanse there was no sound and no movement
one great gray bird a gull or curlew soared aloft in the blue heaven
he and i seemed to be the only living things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath it
the barren scene the sense of loneliness and the mystery and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart
the boy was nowhere to be seen
but down beneath me in a cleft of the hills there was a circle of the old stone huts and in the middle of them there was one which retained sufficient roof to act as a screen against the weather
my heart leaped within me as i saw it
this must be the burrow where the stranger lurked
at last my foot was on the threshold of his hiding place his secret was within my grasp
as i approached the hut walking as warily as stapleton would do when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly i satisfied myself that the place had indeed been used as a habitation
a vague pathway among the boulders led to the dilapidated opening which served as a door
all was silent within
the unknown might be lurking there or he might be prowling on the moor
my nerves tingled with the sense of adventure
throwing aside my cigarette i closed my hand upon the butt of my revolver and walking swiftly up to the door i looked in
the place was empty
but there were ample signs that i had not come upon a false scent
this was certainly where the man lived
some blankets rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which neolithic man had once slumbered
the ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate
beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket half full of water
a litter of empty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time and i saw as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light a pannikin and a half full bottle of spirits standing in the corner
in the middle of the hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table and upon this stood a small cloth bundle the same no doubt which i had seen through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy
it contained a loaf of bread a tinned tongue and two tins of preserved peaches
as i set it down again after having examined it my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it
i raised it and this was what i read roughly scrawled in pencil dr
watson has gone to coombe tracey
for a minute i stood there with the paper in my hands thinking out the meaning of this curt message
it was i then and not sir henry who was being dogged by this secret man
he had not followed me himself but he had set an agent the boy perhaps upon my track and this was his report
possibly i had taken no step since i had been upon the moor which had not been observed and reported
always there was this feeling of an unseen force a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and delicacy holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme moment that one realized that one was indeed entangled in its meshes
if there was one report there might be others so i looked round the hut in search of them
there was no trace however of anything of the kind nor could i discover any sign which might indicate the character or intentions of the man who lived in this singular place save that he must be of spartan habits and cared little for the comforts of life
when i thought of the heavy rains and looked at the gaping roof i understood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that inhospitable abode
was he our malignant enemy or was he by chance our guardian angel
i swore that i would not leave the hut until i knew
outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with scarlet and gold
its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches by the distant pools which lay amid the great grimpen mire
there were the two towers of baskerville hall and there a distant blur of smoke which marked the village of grimpen
between the two behind the hill was the house of the stapletons
all was sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light and yet as i looked at them my soul shared none of the peace of nature but quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that interview which every instant was bringing nearer
with tingling nerves but a fixed purpose i sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant
and then at last i heard him
far away came the sharp clink of a boot striking upon a stone
then another and yet another coming nearer and nearer
i shrank back into the darkest corner and cocked the pistol in my pocket determined not to discover myself until i had an opportunity of seeing something of the stranger
there was a long pause which showed that he had stopped
then once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the opening of the hut
it is a lovely evening my dear watson said a well known voice
i really think that you will be more comfortable outside than in
for a moment or two i sat breathless hardly able to believe my ears
then my senses and my voice came back to me while a crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul
that cold incisive ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world
holmes
i cried holmes
come out said he and please be careful with the revolver
i stooped under the rude lintel and there he sat upon a stone outside his gray eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon my astonished features
he was thin and worn but clear and alert his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind
in his tweed suit and cloth cap he looked like any other tourist upon the moor and he had contrived with that catlike love of personal cleanliness which was one of his characteristics that his chin should be as smooth and his linen as perfect as if he were in baker street
i never was more glad to see anyone in my life said i as i wrung him by the hand
or more astonished eh
well i must confess to it
the surprise was not all on one side i assure you
i had no idea that you had found my occasional retreat still less that you were inside it until i was within twenty paces of the door
my footprint i presume
no watson i fear that i could not undertake to recognize your footprint amid all the footprints of the world
if you seriously desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist for when i see the stub of a cigarette marked bradley oxford street i know that my friend watson is in the neighbourhood
you will see it there beside the path
you threw it down no doubt at that supreme moment when you charged into the empty hut
exactly
i thought as much and knowing your admirable tenacity i was convinced that you were sitting in ambush a weapon within reach waiting for the tenant to return
so you actually thought that i was the criminal
i did not know who you were but i was determined to find out
excellent watson
and how did you localize me
you saw me perhaps on the night of the convict hunt when i was so imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me
yes i saw you then
and have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one
no your boy had been observed and that gave me a guide where to look
the old gentleman with the telescope no doubt
i could not make it out when first i saw the light flashing upon the lens
he rose and peeped into the hut
ha i see that cartwright has brought up some supplies
what's this paper
so you have been to coombe tracey have you
yes
to see mrs
laura lyons
exactly
well done
our researches have evidently been running on parallel lines and when we unite our results i expect we shall have a fairly full knowledge of the case
well i am glad from my heart that you are here for indeed the responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my nerves
but how in the name of wonder did you come here and what have you been doing
i thought that you were in baker street working out that case of blackmailing
that was what i wished you to think
then you use me and yet do not trust me
i cried with some bitterness
i think that i have deserved better at your hands holmes
my dear fellow you have been invaluable to me in this as in many other cases and i beg that you will forgive me if i have seemed to play a trick upon you
in truth it was partly for your own sake that i did it and it was my appreciation of the danger which you ran which led me to come down and examine the matter for myself
had i been with sir henry and you it is confident that my point of view would have been the same as yours and my presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on their guard
as it is i have been able to get about as i could not possibly have done had i been living in the hall and i remain an unknown factor in the business ready to throw in all my weight at a critical moment
but why keep me in the dark
for you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have led to my discovery
you would have wished to tell me something or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other and so an unnecessary risk would be run
i brought cartwright down with me you remember the little chap at the express office and he has seen after my simple wants a loaf of bread and a clean collar
what does man want more
he has given me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of feet and both have been invaluable
then my reports have all been wasted
my voice trembled as i recalled the pains and the pride with which i had composed them
holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket
here are your reports my dear fellow and very well thumbed i assure you
i made excellent arrangements and they are only delayed one day upon their way
i must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult case
i was still rather raw over the deception which had been practised upon me but the warmth of holmes's praise drove my anger from my mind
i felt also in my heart that he was right in what he said and that it was really best for our purpose that i should not have known that he was upon the moor
that's better said he seeing the shadow rise from my face
and now tell me the result of your visit to mrs
laura lyons it was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone for i am already aware that she is the one person in coombe tracey who might be of service to us in the matter
in fact if you had not gone today it is exceedingly probable that i should have gone tomorrow
the sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor
the air had turned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth
there sitting together in the twilight i told holmes of my conversation with the lady
so interested was he that i had to repeat some of it twice before he was satisfied
this is most important said he when i had concluded
it fills up a gap which i had been unable to bridge in this most complex affair
you are aware perhaps that a close intimacy exists between this lady and the man stapleton
i did not know of a close intimacy
there can be no doubt about the matter
they meet they write there is a complete understanding between them
now this puts a very powerful weapon into our hands
if i could only use it to detach his wife his wife
i am giving you some information now in return for all that you have given me
the lady who has passed here as miss stapleton is in reality his wife
good heavens holmes
are you sure of what you say
how could he have permitted sir henry to fall in love with her
sir henry's falling in love could do no harm to anyone except sir henry
he took particular care that sir henry did not make love to her as you have yourself observed
i repeat that the lady is his wife and not his sister
but why this elaborate deception
because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to him in the character of a free woman
all my unspoken instincts my vague suspicions suddenly took shape and centred upon the naturalist
in that impassive colourless man with his straw hat and his butterfly net i seemed to see something terrible a creature of infinite patience and craft with a smiling face and a murderous heart
it is he then who is our enemy it is he who dogged us in london
so i read the riddle
and the warning it must have come from her
exactly
the shape of some monstrous villainy half seen half guessed loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long
but are you sure of this holmes
how do you know that the woman is his wife
because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you and i dare say he has many a time regretted it since
he was once a schoolmaster in the north of england
now there is no one more easy to trace than a schoolmaster
there are scholastic agencies by which one may identify any man who has been in the profession
a little investigation showed me that a school had come to grief under atrocious circumstances and that the man who had owned it the name was different had disappeared with his wife
the descriptions agreed
when i learned that the missing man was devoted to entomology the identification was complete
the darkness was rising but much was still hidden by the shadows
if this woman is in truth his wife where does mrs
laura lyons come in
i asked
that is one of the points upon which your own researches have shed a light
your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very much
i did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her husband
in that case regarding stapleton as an unmarried man she counted no doubt upon becoming his wife
and when she is undeceived
why then we may find the lady of service
it must be our first duty to see her both of us tomorrow
don't you think watson that you are away from your charge rather long
your place should be at baskerville hall
the last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had settled upon the moor
a few faint stars were gleaming in a violet sky
one last question holmes i said as i rose
surely there is no need of secrecy between you and me
what is the meaning of it all
what is he after
holmes's voice sank as he answered it is murder watson refined cold blooded deliberate murder
do not ask me for particulars
my nets are closing upon him even as his are upon sir henry and with your help he is already almost at my mercy
there is but one danger which can threaten us
it is that he should strike before we are ready to do so
another day two at the most and i have my case complete but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watched her ailing child
your mission today has justified itself and yet i could almost wish that you had not left his side
hark
a terrible scream a prolonged yell of horror and anguish burst out of the silence of the moor
that frightful cry turned the blood to ice in my veins
oh my god
i gasped
what is it
what does it mean
holmes had sprung to his feet and i saw his dark athletic outline at the door of the hut his shoulders stooping his head thrust forward his face peering into the darkness
hush
he whispered
hush
the cry had been loud on account of its vehemence but it had pealed out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain
now it burst upon our ears nearer louder more urgent than before
where is it
holmes whispered and i knew from the thrill of his voice that he the man of iron was shaken to the soul
where is it watson
there i think
i pointed into the darkness
no there
again the agonized cry swept through the silent night louder and much nearer than ever
and a new sound mingled with it a deep muttered rumble musical and yet menacing rising and falling like the low constant murmur of the sea
the hound
cried holmes
come watson come
great heavens if we are too late
he had started running swiftly over the moor and i had followed at his heels
but now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately in front of us there came one last despairing yell and then a dull heavy thud
we halted and listened
not another sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night
i saw holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted
he stamped his feet upon the ground
he has beaten us watson
we are too late
no no surely not
fool that i was to hold my hand
and you watson see what comes of abandoning your charge
but by heaven if the worst has happened we'll avenge him
blindly we ran through the gloom blundering against boulders forcing our way through gorse bushes panting up hills and rushing down slopes heading always in the direction whence those dreadful sounds had come
at every rise holmes looked eagerly round him but the shadows were thick upon the moor and nothing moved upon its dreary face
can you see anything
nothing
but hark what is that
a low moan had fallen upon our ears
there it was again upon our left
on that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which overlooked a stone strewn slope
on its jagged face was spread eagled some dark irregular object
as we ran towards it the vague outline hardened into a definite shape
it was a prostrate man face downward upon the ground the head doubled under him at a horrible angle the shoulders rounded and the body hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault
so grotesque was the attitude that i could not for the instant realize that that moan had been the passing of his soul
not a whisper not a rustle rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped
holmes laid his hand upon him and held it up again with an exclamation of horror
the gleam of the match which he struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly pool which widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim
and it shone upon something else which turned our hearts sick and faint within us the body of sir henry baskerville
there was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar ruddy tweed suit the very one which he had worn on the first morning that we had seen him in baker street
we caught the one clear glimpse of it and then the match flickered and went out even as the hope had gone out of our souls
holmes groaned and his face glimmered white through the darkness
the brute
the brute
i cried with clenched hands
oh holmes i shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate
i am more to blame than you watson
in order to have my case well rounded and complete i have thrown away the life of my client
it is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my career
but how could i know how could i know that he would risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my warnings
that we should have heard his screams my god those screams and yet have been unable to save him
where is this brute of a hound which drove him to his death
it may be lurking among these rocks at this instant
and stapleton where is he
he shall answer for this deed
he shall
i will see to that
uncle and nephew have been murdered the one frightened to death by the very sight of a beast which he thought to be supernatural the other driven to his end in his wild flight to escape from it
but now we have to prove the connection between the man and the beast
save from what we heard we cannot even swear to the existence of the latter since sir henry has evidently died from the fall
but by heavens cunning as he is the fellow shall be in my power before another day is past
we stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had brought all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end
then as the moon rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which our poor friend had fallen and from the summit we gazed out over the shadowy moor half silver and half gloom
far away miles off in the direction of grimpen a single steady yellow light was shining
it could only come from the lonely abode of the stapletons
with a bitter curse i shook my fist at it as i gazed
why should we not seize him at once
our case is not complete
the fellow is wary and cunning to the last degree
it is not what we know but what we can prove
if we make one false move the villain may escape us yet
what can we do
there will be plenty for us to do tomorrow
tonight we can only perform the last offices to our poor friend
together we made our way down the precipitous slope and approached the body black and clear against the silvered stones
the agony of those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain and blurred my eyes with tears
we must send for help holmes
we cannot carry him all the way to the hall
good heavens are you mad
he had uttered a cry and bent over the body
now he was dancing and laughing and wringing my hand
could this be my stern self contained friend
these were hidden fires indeed
a beard
a beard
the man has a beard
a beard
it is not the baronet it is why it is my neighbour the convict
with feverish haste we had turned the body over and that dripping beard was pointing up to the cold clear moon
there could be no doubt about the beetling forehead the sunken animal eyes
it was indeed the same face which had glared upon me in the light of the candle from over the rock the face of selden the criminal
then in an instant it was all clear to me
i remembered how the baronet had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to barrymore
barrymore had passed it on in order to help selden in his escape
boots shirt cap it was all sir henry's
the tragedy was still black enough but this man had at least deserved death by the laws of his country
i told holmes how the matter stood my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy
then the clothes have been the poor devil's death said he
it is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article of sir henry's the boot which was abstracted in the hotel in all probability and so ran this man down
there is one very singular thing however how came selden in the darkness to know that the hound was on his trail
he heard him
to hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture by screaming wildly for help
by his cries he must have run a long way after he knew the animal was on his track
how did he know
a greater mystery to me is why this hound presuming that all our conjectures are correct i presume nothing
well then why this hound should be loose tonight
i suppose that it does not always run loose upon the moor
stapleton would not let it go unless he had reason to think that sir henry would be there
my difficulty is the more formidable of the two for i think that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours while mine may remain forever a mystery
the question now is what shall we do with this poor wretch's body
we cannot leave it here to the foxes and the ravens
i suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can communicate with the police
exactly
i have no doubt that you and i could carry it so far
halloa watson what's this
it's the man himself by all that's wonderful and audacious
not a word to show your suspicions not a word or my plans crumble to the ground
a figure was approaching us over the moor and i saw the dull red glow of a cigar
the moon shone upon him and i could distinguish the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist
he stopped when he saw us and then came on again
why dr
watson that's not you is it
you are the last man that i should have expected to see out on the moor at this time of night
but dear me what's this
somebody hurt
not don't tell me that it is our friend sir henry
he hurried past me and stooped over the dead man
i heard a sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fell from his fingers
who who's this
he stammered
it is selden the man who escaped from princetown
stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us but by a supreme effort he had overcome his amazement and his disappointment
he looked sharply from holmes to me
dear me
what a very shocking affair
how did he die
he appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks
my friend and i were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry
i heard a cry also
that was what brought me out
i was uneasy about sir henry
why about sir henry in particular
i could not help asking
because i had suggested that he should come over
when he did not come i was surprised and i naturally became alarmed for his safety when i heard cries upon the moor
by the way his eyes darted again from my face to holmes's did you hear anything else besides a cry
no said holmes did you
no
what do you mean then
oh you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom hound and so on
it is said to be heard at night upon the moor
i was wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound tonight
we heard nothing of the kind said i
and what is your theory of this poor fellow's death
i have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off his head
he has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and eventually fallen over here and broken his neck
that seems the most reasonable theory said stapleton and he gave a sigh which i took to indicate his relief
what do you think about it mr
sherlock holmes
my friend bowed his compliments
you are quick at identification said he
we have been expecting you in these parts since dr
watson came down
you are in time to see a tragedy
yes indeed
i have no doubt that my friend's explanation will cover the facts
i will take an unpleasant remembrance back to london with me tomorrow
oh you return tomorrow
that is my intention
i hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which have puzzled us
holmes shrugged his shoulders
one cannot always have the success for which one hopes
an investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours
it has not been a satisfactory case
my friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner
stapleton still looked hard at him
then he turned to me
i would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house but it would give my sister such a fright that i do not feel justified in doing it
i think that if we put something over his face he will be safe until morning
and so it was arranged
resisting stapleton's offer of hospitality holmes and i set off to baskerville hall leaving the naturalist to return alone
looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the broad moor and behind him that one black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly to his end
we're at close grips at last said holmes as we walked together across the moor
what a nerve the fellow has
how he pulled himself together in the face of what must have been a paralyzing shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his plot
i told you in london watson and i tell you now again that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel
i am sorry that he has seen you
and so was i at first
but there was no getting out of it
what effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows you are here
it may cause him to be more cautious or it may drive him to desperate measures at once
like most clever criminals he may be too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has completely deceived us
why should we not arrest him at once
my dear watson you were born to be a man of action
your instinct is always to do something energetic
but supposing for argument's sake that we had him arrested tonight what on earth the better off should we be for that
we could prove nothing against him
there's the devilish cunning of it
if he were acting through a human agent we could get some evidence but if we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master
surely we have a case
not a shadow of one only surmise and conjecture
we should be laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such evidence
there is sir charles's death
found dead without a mark upon him
you and i know that he died of sheer fright and we know also what frightened him but how are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it
what signs are there of a hound
where are the marks of its fangs
of course we know that a hound does not bite a dead body and that sir charles was dead before ever the brute overtook him
but we have to prove all this and we are not in a position to do it
well then tonight
we are not much better off tonight
again there was no direct connection between the hound and the man's death
we never saw the hound
we heard it but we could not prove that it was running upon this man's trail
there is a complete absence of motive
no my dear fellow we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that we have no case at present and that it is worth our while to run any risk in order to establish one
and how do you propose to do so
i have great hopes of what mrs
laura lyons may do for us when the position of affairs is made clear to her
and i have my own plan as well
sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof but i hope before the day is past to have the upper hand at last
i could draw nothing further from him and he walked lost in thought as far as the baskerville gates
are you coming up
yes i see no reason for further concealment
but one last word watson
say nothing of the hound to sir henry
let him think that selden's death was as stapleton would have us believe
he will have a better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo tomorrow when he is engaged if i remember your report aright to dine with these people
and so am i
then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone
that will be easily arranged
and now if we are too late for dinner i think that we are both ready for our suppers
sir henry was more pleased than surprised to see sherlock holmes for he had for some days been expecting that recent events would bring him down from london
he did raise his eyebrows however when he found that my friend had neither any luggage nor any explanations for its absence
between us we soon supplied his wants and then over a belated supper we explained to the baronet as much of our experience as it seemed desirable that he should know
but first i had the unpleasant duty of breaking the news to barrymore and his wife
to him it may have been an unmitigated relief but she wept bitterly in her apron
to all the world he was the man of violence half animal and half demon but to her he always remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood the child who had clung to her hand
evil indeed is the man who has not one woman to mourn him
i've been moping in the house all day since watson went off in the morning said the baronet
i guess i should have some credit for i have kept my promise
if i hadn't sworn not to go about alone i might have had a more lively evening for i had a message from stapleton asking me over there
i have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening said holmes drily
by the way i don't suppose you appreciate that we have been mourning over you as having broken your neck
sir henry opened his eyes
how was that
this poor wretch was dressed in your clothes
i fear your servant who gave them to him may get into trouble with the police
that is unlikely
there was no mark on any of them as far as i know
that's lucky for him in fact it's lucky for all of you since you are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter
i am not sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not to arrest the whole household
watson's reports are most incriminating documents
but how about the case
asked the baronet
have you made anything out of the tangle
i don't know that watson and i are much the wiser since we came down
i think that i shall be in a position to make the situation rather more clear to you before long
it has been an exceedingly difficult and most complicated business
there are several points upon which we still want light but it is coming all the same
we've had one experience as watson has no doubt told you
we heard the hound on the moor so i can swear that it is not all empty superstition
i had something to do with dogs when i was out west and i know one when i hear one
if you can muzzle that one and put him on a chain i'll be ready to swear you are the greatest detective of all time
i think i will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will give me your help
whatever you tell me to do i will do
very good and i will ask you also to do it blindly without always asking the reason
just as you like
if you will do this i think the chances are that our little problem will soon be solved
i have no doubt he stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the air
the lamp beat upon his face and so intent was it and so still that it might have been that of a clear cut classical statue a personification of alertness and expectation
what is it
we both cried
i could see as he looked down that he was repressing some internal emotion
his features were still composed but his eyes shone with amused exultation
excuse the admiration of a connoisseur said he as he waved his hand towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite wall
watson won't allow that i know anything of art but that is mere jealousy because our views upon the subject differ
now these are a really very fine series of portraits
well i'm glad to hear you say so said sir henry glancing with some surprise at my friend
i don't pretend to know much about these things and i'd be a better judge of a horse or a steer than of a picture
i didn't know that you found time for such things
i know what is good when i see it and i see it now
that's a kneller i'll swear that lady in the blue silk over yonder and the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a reynolds
they are all family portraits i presume
every one
do you know the names
barrymore has been coaching me in them and i think i can say my lessons fairly well
who is the gentleman with the telescope
that is rear admiral baskerville who served under rodney in the west indies
the man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is sir william baskerville who was chairman of committees of the house of commons under pitt
and this cavalier opposite to me the one with the black velvet and the lace
ah you have a right to know about him
that is the cause of all the mischief the wicked hugo who started the hound of the baskervilles
we're not likely to forget him
i gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait
dear me
said holmes he seems a quiet meek mannered man enough but i dare say that there was a lurking devil in his eyes
i had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person
there's no doubt about the authenticity for the name and the date are on the back of the canvas
holmes said little more but the picture of the old roysterer seemed to have a fascination for him and his eyes were continually fixed upon it during supper
it was not until later when sir henry had gone to his room that i was able to follow the trend of his thoughts
he led me back into the banqueting hall his bedroom candle in his hand and he held it up against the time stained portrait on the wall
do you see anything there
i looked at the broad plumed hat the curling love locks the white lace collar and the straight severe face which was framed between them
it was not a brutal countenance but it was prim hard and stern with a firm set thin lipped mouth and a coldly intolerant eye
is it like anyone you know
there is something of sir henry about the jaw
just a suggestion perhaps
but wait an instant
he stood upon a chair and holding up the light in his left hand he curved his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets
good heavens
i cried in amazement
the face of stapleton had sprung out of the canvas
ha you see it now
my eyes have been trained to examine faces and not their trimmings
it is the first quality of a criminal investigator that he should see through a disguise
but this is marvellous
it might be his portrait
yes it is an interesting instance of a throwback which appears to be both physical and spiritual
a study of family portraits is enough to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation
the fellow is a baskerville that is evident
with designs upon the succession
exactly
this chance of the picture has supplied us with one of our most obvious missing links
we have him watson we have him and i dare swear that before tomorrow night he will be fluttering in our net as helpless as one of his own butterflies
a pin a cork and a card and we add him to the baker street collection
he burst into one of his rare fits of laughter as he turned away from the picture
i have not heard him laugh often and it has always boded ill to somebody
i was up betimes in the morning but holmes was afoot earlier still for i saw him as i dressed coming up the drive
yes we should have a full day today he remarked and he rubbed his hands with the joy of action
the nets are all in place and the drag is about to begin
we'll know before the day is out whether we have caught our big leanjawed pike or whether he has got through the meshes
have you been on the moor already
i have sent a report from grimpen to princetown as to the death of selden
i think i can promise that none of you will be troubled in the matter
and i have also communicated with my faithful cartwright who would certainly have pined away at the door of my hut as a dog does at his master's grave if i had not set his mind at rest about my safety
what is the next move
to see sir henry
ah here he is
good morning holmes said the baronet
you look like a general who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff
that is the exact situation
watson was asking for orders
and so do i
very good
you are engaged as i understand to dine with our friends the stapletons tonight
i hope that you will come also
they are very hospitable people and i am sure that they would be very glad to see you
i fear that watson and i must go to london
to london
yes i think that we should be more useful there at the present juncture
the baronet's face perceptibly lengthened
i hoped that you were going to see me through this business
the hall and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is alone
my dear fellow you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what i tell you
you can tell your friends that we should have been happy to have come with you but that urgent business required us to be in town
we hope very soon to return to devonshire
will you remember to give them that message
if you insist upon it
there is no alternative i assure you
i saw by the baronet's clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by what he regarded as our desertion
when do you desire to go
he asked coldly
immediately after breakfast
we will drive in to coombe tracey but watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come back to you
watson you will send a note to stapleton to tell him that you regret that you cannot come
i have a good mind to go to london with you said the baronet
why should i stay here alone
because it is your post of duty
because you gave me your word that you would do as you were told and i tell you to stay
all right then i'll stay
one more direction
i wish you to drive to merripit house
send back your trap however and let them know that you intend to walk home
to walk across the moor
yes
but that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me not to do
this time you may do it with safety
if i had not every confidence in your nerve and courage i would not suggest it but it is essential that you should do it
then i will do it
and as you value your life do not go across the moor in any direction save along the straight path which leads from merripit house to the grimpen road and is your natural way home
i will do just what you say
very good
i should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as possible so as to reach london in the afternoon
i was much astounded by this programme though i remembered that holmes had said to stapleton on the night before that his visit would terminate next day
it had not crossed my mind however that he would wish me to go with him nor could i understand how we could both be absent at a moment which he himself declared to be critical
there was nothing for it however but implicit obedience so we bade good bye to our rueful friend and a couple of hours afterwards we were at the station of coombe tracey and had dispatched the trap upon its return journey
a small boy was waiting upon the platform
any orders sir
you will take this train to town cartwright
the moment you arrive you will send a wire to sir henry baskerville in my name to say that if he finds the pocketbook which i have dropped he is to send it by registered post to baker street
yes sir
and ask at the station office if there is a message for me
the boy returned with a telegram which holmes handed to me
it ran wire received
coming down with unsigned warrant
arrive five forty
lestrade
that is in answer to mine of this morning
he is the best of the professionals i think and we may need his assistance
now watson i think that we cannot employ our time better than by calling upon your acquaintance mrs
laura lyons
his plan of campaign was beginning to be evident
he would use the baronet in order to convince the stapletons that we were really gone while we should actually return at the instant when we were likely to be needed
that telegram from london if mentioned by sir henry to the stapletons must remove the last suspicions from their minds
already i seemed to see our nets drawing closer around that leanjawed pike
mrs
laura lyons was in her office and sherlock holmes opened his interview with a frankness and directness which considerably amazed her
i am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of the late sir charles baskerville said he
my friend here dr
watson has informed me of what you have communicated and also of what you have withheld in connection with that matter
what have i withheld
she asked defiantly
you have confessed that you asked sir charles to be at the gate at ten o'clock
we know that that was the place and hour of his death
you have withheld what the connection is between these events
there is no connection
in that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one
but i think that we shall succeed in establishing a connection after all
i wish to be perfectly frank with you mrs
lyons
we regard this case as one of murder and the evidence may implicate not only your friend mr
stapleton but his wife as well
the lady sprang from her chair
his wife
she cried
the fact is no longer a secret
the person who has passed for his sister is really his wife
mrs
lyons had resumed her seat
her hands were grasping the arms of her chair and i saw that the pink nails had turned white with the pressure of her grip
his wife
she said again
his wife
he is not a married man
sherlock holmes shrugged his shoulders
prove it to me
prove it to me
and if you can do so
the fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words
i have come prepared to do so said holmes drawing several papers from his pocket
here is a photograph of the couple taken in york four years ago
it is indorsed 'mr
and mrs
vandeleur ' but you will have no difficulty in recognizing him and her also if you know her by sight
here are three written descriptions by trustworthy witnesses of mr
and mrs
vandeleur who at that time kept st
oliver's private school
read them and see if you can doubt the identity of these people
she glanced at them and then looked up at us with the set rigid face of a desperate woman
mr
holmes she said this man had offered me marriage on condition that i could get a divorce from my husband
he has lied to me the villain in every conceivable way
not one word of truth has he ever told me
and why why
i imagined that all was for my own sake
but now i see that i was never anything but a tool in his hands
why should i preserve faith with him who never kept any with me
why should i try to shield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts
ask me what you like and there is nothing which i shall hold back
one thing i swear to you and that is that when i wrote the letter i never dreamed of any harm to the old gentleman who had been my kindest friend
i entirely believe you madam said sherlock holmes
the recital of these events must be very painful to you and perhaps it will make it easier if i tell you what occurred and you can check me if i make any material mistake
the sending of this letter was suggested to you by stapleton
he dictated it
i presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive help from sir charles for the legal expenses connected with your divorce
exactly
and then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from keeping the appointment
he told me that it would hurt his self respect that any other man should find the money for such an object and that though he was a poor man himself he would devote his last penny to removing the obstacles which divided us
he appears to be a very consistent character
and then you heard nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper
no
and he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with sir charles
he did
he said that the death was a very mysterious one and that i should certainly be suspected if the facts came out
he frightened me into remaining silent
quite so
but you had your suspicions
she hesitated and looked down
i knew him she said
but if he had kept faith with me i should always have done so with him
i think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape said sherlock holmes
you have had him in your power and he knew it and yet you are alive
you have been walking for some months very near to the edge of a precipice
we must wish you good morning now mrs
lyons and it is probable that you will very shortly hear from us again
our case becomes rounded off and difficulty after difficulty thins away in front of us said holmes as we stood waiting for the arrival of the express from town
i shall soon be in the position of being able to put into a single connected narrative one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times
students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in godno in little russia in the year ' and of course there are the anderson murders in north carolina but this case possesses some features which are entirely its own
even now we have no clear case against this very wily man
but i shall be very much surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this night
the london express came roaring into the station and a small wiry bulldog of a man had sprung from a first class carriage
we all three shook hands and i saw at once from the reverential way in which lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a good deal since the days when they had first worked together
i could well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasoner used then to excite in the practical man
anything good
he asked
the biggest thing for years said holmes
we have two hours before we need think of starting
i think we might employ it in getting some dinner and then lestrade we will take the london fog out of your throat by giving you a breath of the pure night air of dartmoor
never been there
ah well i don't suppose you will forget your first visit
one of sherlock holmes's defects if indeed one may call it a defect was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment
partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature which loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him
partly also from his professional caution which urged him never to take any chances
the result however was very trying for those who were acting as his agents and assistants
i had often suffered under it but never more so than during that long drive in the darkness
the great ordeal was in front of us at last we were about to make our final effort and yet holmes had said nothing and i could only surmise what his course of action would be
my nerves thrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon our faces and the dark void spaces on either side of the narrow road told me that we were back upon the moor once again
every stride of the horses and every turn of the wheels was taking us nearer to our supreme adventure
our conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of the hired wagonette so that we were forced to talk of trivial matters when our nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation
it was a relief to me after that unnatural restraint when we at last passed frankland's house and knew that we were drawing near to the hall and to the scene of action
we did not drive up to the door but got down near the gate of the avenue
the wagonette was paid off and ordered to return to coombe tracey forthwith while we started to walk to merripit house
are you armed lestrade
the little detective smiled
as long as i have my trousers i have a hip pocket and as long as i have my hip pocket i have something in it
good
my friend and i are also ready for emergencies
you're mighty close about this affair mr
holmes
what's the game now
a waiting game
my word it does not seem a very cheerful place said the detective with a shiver glancing round him at the gloomy slopes of the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lay over the grimpen mire
i see the lights of a house ahead of us
that is merripit house and the end of our journey
i must request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper
we moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the house but holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards from it
this will do said he
these rocks upon the right make an admirable screen
we are to wait here
yes we shall make our little ambush here
get into this hollow lestrade
you have been inside the house have you not watson
can you tell the position of the rooms
what are those latticed windows at this end
i think they are the kitchen windows
and the one beyond which shines so brightly
that is certainly the dining room
the blinds are up
you know the lie of the land best
creep forward quietly and see what they are doing but for heaven's sake don't let them know that they are watched
i tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which surrounded the stunted orchard
creeping in its shadow i reached a point whence i could look straight through the uncurtained window
there were only two men in the room sir henry and stapleton
they sat with their profiles towards me on either side of the round table
both of them were smoking cigars and coffee and wine were in front of them
stapleton was talking with animation but the baronet looked pale and distrait
perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill omened moor was weighing heavily upon his mind
as i watched them stapleton rose and left the room while sir henry filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair puffing at his cigar
i heard the creak of a door and the crisp sound of boots upon gravel
the steps passed along the path on the other side of the wall under which i crouched
looking over i saw the naturalist pause at the door of an out house in the corner of the orchard
a key turned in a lock and as he passed in there was a curious scuffling noise from within
he was only a minute or so inside and then i heard the key turn once more and he passed me and reentered the house
i saw him rejoin his guest and i crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to tell them what i had seen
you say watson that the lady is not there
holmes asked when i had finished my report
no
where can she be then since there is no light in any other room except the kitchen
i cannot think where she is
i have said that over the great grimpen mire there hung a dense white fog
it was drifting slowly in our direction and banked itself up like a wall on that side of us low but thick and well defined
the moon shone on it and it looked like a great shimmering ice field with the heads of the distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface
holmes's face was turned towards it and he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift
it's moving towards us watson
is that serious
very serious indeed the one thing upon earth which could have disarranged my plans
he can't be very long now
it is already ten o'clock
our success and even his life may depend upon his coming out before the fog is over the path
the night was clear and fine above us
the stars shone cold and bright while a half moon bathed the whole scene in a soft uncertain light
before us lay the dark bulk of the house its serrated roof and bristling chimneys hard outlined against the silver spangled sky
broad bars of golden light from the lower windows stretched across the orchard and the moor
one of them was suddenly shut off
the servants had left the kitchen
there only remained the lamp in the dining room where the two men the murderous host and the unconscious guest still chatted over their cigars
every minute that white woolly plain which covered one half of the moor was drifting closer and closer to the house
already the first thin wisps of it were curling across the golden square of the lighted window
the farther wall of the orchard was already invisible and the trees were standing out of a swirl of white vapour
as we watched it the fog wreaths came crawling round both corners of the house and rolled slowly into one dense bank on which the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange ship upon a shadowy sea
holmes struck his hand passionately upon the rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his impatience
if he isn't out in a quarter of an hour the path will be covered
in half an hour we won't be able to see our hands in front of us
shall we move farther back upon higher ground
yes i think it would be as well
so as the fog bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we were half a mile from the house and still that dense white sea with the moon silvering its upper edge swept slowly and inexorably on
we are going too far said holmes
we dare not take the chance of his being overtaken before he can reach us
at all costs we must hold our ground where we are
he dropped on his knees and clapped his ear to the ground
thank god i think that i hear him coming
a sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor
crouching among the stones we stared intently at the silver tipped bank in front of us
the steps grew louder and through the fog as through a curtain there stepped the man whom we were awaiting
he looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear starlit night
then he came swiftly along the path passed close to where we lay and went on up the long slope behind us
as he walked he glanced continually over either shoulder like a man who is ill at ease
hist
cried holmes and i heard the sharp click of a cocking pistol
look out
it's coming
there was a thin crisp continuous patter from somewhere in the heart of that crawling bank
the cloud was within fifty yards of where we lay and we glared at it all three uncertain what horror was about to break from the heart of it
i was at holmes's elbow and i glanced for an instant at his face
it was pale and exultant his eyes shining brightly in the moonlight
but suddenly they started forward in a rigid fixed stare and his lips parted in amazement
at the same instant lestrade gave a yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground
i sprang to my feet my inert hand grasping my pistol my mind paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from the shadows of the fog
a hound it was an enormous coal black hound but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen
fire burst from its open mouth its eyes glowed with a smouldering glare its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined in flickering flame
never in the delirious dream of a disordered brain could anything more savage more appalling more hellish be conceived than that dark form and savage face which broke upon us out of the wall of fog
with long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the track following hard upon the footsteps of our friend
so paralyzed were we by the apparition that we allowed him to pass before we had recovered our nerve
then holmes and i both fired together and the creature gave a hideous howl which showed that one at least had hit him
he did not pause however but bounded onward
far away on the path we saw sir henry looking back his face white in the moonlight his hands raised in horror glaring helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunting him down
but that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the winds
if he was vulnerable he was mortal and if we could wound him we could kill him
never have i seen a man run as holmes ran that night
i am reckoned fleet of foot but he outpaced me as much as i outpaced the little professional
in front of us as we flew up the track we heard scream after scream from sir henry and the deep roar of the hound
i was in time to see the beast spring upon its victim hurl him to the ground and worry at his throat
but the next instant holmes had emptied five barrels of his revolver into the creature's flank
with a last howl of agony and a vicious snap in the air it rolled upon its back four feet pawing furiously and then fell limp upon its side
i stooped panting and pressed my pistol to the dreadful shimmering head but it was useless to press the trigger
the giant hound was dead
sir henry lay insensible where he had fallen
we tore away his collar and holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw that there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in time
already our friend's eyelids shivered and he made a feeble effort to move
lestrade thrust his brandy flask between the baronet's teeth and two frightened eyes were looking up at us
my god
he whispered
what was it
what in heaven's name was it
it's dead whatever it is said holmes
we've laid the family ghost once and forever
in mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was lying stretched before us
it was not a pure bloodhound and it was not a pure mastiff but it appeared to be a combination of the two gaunt savage and as large as a small lioness
even now in the stillness of death the huge jaws seemed to be dripping with a bluish flame and the small deep set cruel eyes were ringed with fire
i placed my hand upon the glowing muzzle and as i held them up my own fingers smouldered and gleamed in the darkness
phosphorus i said
a cunning preparation of it said holmes sniffing at the dead animal
there is no smell which might have interfered with his power of scent
we owe you a deep apology sir henry for having exposed you to this fright
i was prepared for a hound but not for such a creature as this
and the fog gave us little time to receive him
you have saved my life
having first endangered it
are you strong enough to stand
give me another mouthful of that brandy and i shall be ready for anything
so
now if you will help me up
what do you propose to do
to leave you here
you are not fit for further adventures tonight
if you will wait one or other of us will go back with you to the hall
he tried to stagger to his feet but he was still ghastly pale and trembling in every limb
we helped him to a rock where he sat shivering with his face buried in his hands
we must leave you now said holmes
the rest of our work must be done and every moment is of importance
we have our case and now we only want our man
it's a thousand to one against our finding him at the house he continued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path
those shots must have told him that the game was up
we were some distance off and this fog may have deadened them
he followed the hound to call him off of that you may be certain
no no he's gone by this time
but we'll search the house and make sure
the front door was open so we rushed in and hurried from room to room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant who met us in the passage
there was no light save in the dining room but holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house unexplored
no sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing
on the upper floor however one of the bedroom doors was locked
there's someone in here cried lestrade
i can hear a movement
open this door
a faint moaning and rustling came from within
holmes struck the door just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew open
pistol in hand we all three rushed into the room
but there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant villain whom we expected to see
instead we were faced by an object so strange and so unexpected that we stood for a moment staring at it in amazement
the room had been fashioned into a small museum and the walls were lined by a number of glass topped cases full of that collection of butterflies and moths the formation of which had been the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man
in the centre of this room there was an upright beam which had been placed at some period as a support for the old worm eaten baulk of timber which spanned the roof
to this post a figure was tied so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been used to secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it was that of a man or a woman
one towel passed round the throat and was secured at the back of the pillar
another covered the lower part of the face and over it two dark eyes eyes full of grief and shame and a dreadful questioning stared back at us
in a minute we had torn off the gag unswathed the bonds and mrs
stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us
as her beautiful head fell upon her chest i saw the clear red weal of a whiplash across her neck
the brute
cried holmes
here lestrade your brandy bottle
put her in the chair
she has fainted from ill usage and exhaustion
she opened her eyes again
is he safe
she asked
has he escaped
he cannot escape us madam
no no i did not mean my husband
sir henry
is he safe
yes
and the hound
it is dead
she gave a long sigh of satisfaction
thank god
thank god
oh this villain
see how he has treated me
she shot her arms out from her sleeves and we saw with horror that they were all mottled with bruises
but this is nothing nothing
it is my mind and soul that he has tortured and defiled
i could endure it all ill usage solitude a life of deception everything as long as i could still cling to the hope that i had his love but now i know that in this also i have been his dupe and his tool
she broke into passionate sobbing as she spoke
you bear him no good will madam said holmes
tell us then where we shall find him
if you have ever aided him in evil help us now and so atone
there is but one place where he can have fled she answered
there is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire
it was there that he kept his hound and there also he had made preparations so that he might have a refuge
that is where he would fly
the fog bank lay like white wool against the window
holmes held the lamp towards it
see said he
no one could find his way into the grimpen mire tonight
she laughed and clapped her hands
her eyes and teeth gleamed with fierce merriment
he may find his way in but never out she cried
how can he see the guiding wands tonight
we planted them together he and i to mark the pathway through the mire
oh if i could only have plucked them out today
then indeed you would have had him at your mercy
it was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had lifted
meanwhile we left lestrade in possession of the house while holmes and i went back with the baronet to baskerville hall
the story of the stapletons could no longer be withheld from him but he took the blow bravely when he learned the truth about the woman whom he had loved
but the shock of the night's adventures had shattered his nerves and before morning he lay delirious in a high fever under the care of dr
mortimer
the two of them were destined to travel together round the world before sir henry had become once more the hale hearty man that he had been before he became master of that ill omened estate
and now i come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular narrative in which i have tried to make the reader share those dark fears and vague surmises which clouded our lives so long and ended in so tragic a manner
on the morning after the death of the hound the fog had lifted and we were guided by mrs
stapleton to the point where they had found a pathway through the bog
it helped us to realize the horror of this woman's life when we saw the eagerness and joy with which she laid us on her husband's track
we left her standing upon the thin peninsula of firm peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog
from the end of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the path zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those green scummed pits and foul quagmires which barred the way to the stranger
rank reeds and lush slimy water plants sent an odour of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour onto our faces while a false step plunged us more than once thigh deep into the dark quivering mire which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet
its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we walked and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths so grim and purposeful was the clutch in which it held us
once only we saw a trace that someone had passed that perilous way before us
from amid a tuft of cotton grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing was projecting
holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from the path to seize it and had we not been there to drag him out he could never have set his foot upon firm land again
he held an old black boot in the air
meyers toronto was printed on the leather inside
it is worth a mud bath said he
it is our friend sir henry's missing boot
thrown there by stapleton in his flight
exactly
he retained it in his hand after using it to set the hound upon the track
he fled when he knew the game was up still clutching it
and he hurled it away at this point of his flight
we know at least that he came so far in safety
but more than that we were never destined to know though there was much which we might surmise
there was no chance of finding footsteps in the mire for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon them but as we at last reached firmer ground beyond the morass we all looked eagerly for them
but no slightest sign of them ever met our eyes
if the earth told a true story then stapleton never reached that island of refuge towards which he struggled through the fog upon that last night
somewhere in the heart of the great grimpen mire down in the foul slime of the huge morass which had sucked him in this cold and cruel hearted man is forever buried
many traces we found of him in the bog girt island where he had hid his savage ally
a huge driving wheel and a shaft half filled with rubbish showed the position of an abandoned mine
beside it were the crumbling remains of the cottages of the miners driven away no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp
in one of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined
a skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the debris
a dog
said holmes
by jove a curly haired spaniel
poor mortimer will never see his pet again
well i do not know that this place contains any secret which we have not already fathomed
he could hide his hound but he could not hush its voice and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear
on an emergency he could keep the hound in the out house at merripit but it was always a risk and it was only on the supreme day which he regarded as the end of all his efforts that he dared do it
this paste in the tin is no doubt the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed
it was suggested of course by the story of the family hell hound and by the desire to frighten old sir charles to death
no wonder the poor devil of a convict ran and screamed even as our friend did and as we ourselves might have done when he saw such a creature bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track
it was a cunning device for apart from the chance of driving your victim to his death what peasant would venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight of it as many have done upon the moor
i said it in london watson and i say it again now that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more dangerous man than he who is lying yonder he swept his long arm towards the huge mottled expanse of green splotched bog which stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the moor
it was the end of november and holmes and i sat upon a raw and foggy night on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting room in baker street
since the tragic upshot of our visit to devonshire he had been engaged in two affairs of the utmost importance in the first of which he had exposed the atrocious conduct of colonel upwood in connection with the famous card scandal of the nonpareil club while in the second he had defended the unfortunate mme
montpensier from the charge of murder which hung over her in connection with the death of her step daughter mlle
carere the young lady who as it will be remembered was found six months later alive and married in new york
my friend was in excellent spirits over the success which had attended a succession of difficult and important cases so that i was able to induce him to discuss the details of the baskerville mystery
i had waited patiently for the opportunity for i was aware that he would never permit cases to overlap and that his clear and logical mind would not be drawn from its present work to dwell upon memories of the past
sir henry and dr
mortimer were however in london on their way to that long voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his shattered nerves
they had called upon us that very afternoon so that it was natural that the subject should come up for discussion
the whole course of events said holmes from the point of view of the man who called himself stapleton was simple and direct although to us who had no means in the beginning of knowing the motives of his actions and could only learn part of the facts it all appeared exceedingly complex
i have had the advantage of two conversations with mrs
stapleton and the case has now been so entirely cleared up that i am not aware that there is anything which has remained a secret to us
you will find a few notes upon the matter under the heading b in my indexed list of cases
perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of events from memory
certainly though i cannot guarantee that i carry all the facts in my mind
intense mental concentration has a curious way of blotting out what has passed
the barrister who has his case at his fingers' ends and is able to argue with an expert upon his own subject finds that a week or two of the courts will drive it all out of his head once more
so each of my cases displaces the last and mlle
carere has blurred my recollection of baskerville hall
tomorrow some other little problem may be submitted to my notice which will in turn dispossess the fair french lady and the infamous upwood
so far as the case of the hound goes however i will give you the course of events as nearly as i can and you will suggest anything which i may have forgotten
my inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait did not lie and that this fellow was indeed a baskerville
he was a son of that rodger baskerville the younger brother of sir charles who fled with a sinister reputation to south america where he was said to have died unmarried
he did as a matter of fact marry and had one child this fellow whose real name is the same as his father's
he married beryl garcia one of the beauties of costa rica and having purloined a considerable sum of public money he changed his name to vandeleur and fled to england where he established a school in the east of yorkshire
his reason for attempting this special line of business was that he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage home and that he had used this man's ability to make the undertaking a success
fraser the tutor died however and the school which had begun well sank from disrepute into infamy
the vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name to stapleton and he brought the remains of his fortune his schemes for the future and his taste for entomology to the south of england
i learned at the british museum that he was a recognized authority upon the subject and that the name of vandeleur has been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had in his yorkshire days been the first to describe
we now come to that portion of his life which has proved to be of such intense interest to us
the fellow had evidently made inquiry and found that only two lives intervened between him and a valuable estate
when he went to devonshire his plans were i believe exceedingly hazy but that he meant mischief from the first is evident from the way in which he took his wife with him in the character of his sister
the idea of using her as a decoy was clearly already in his mind though he may not have been certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged
he meant in the end to have the estate and he was ready to use any tool or run any risk for that end
his first act was to establish himself as near to his ancestral home as he could and his second was to cultivate a friendship with sir charles baskerville and with the neighbours
the baronet himself told him about the family hound and so prepared the way for his own death
stapleton as i will continue to call him knew that the old man's heart was weak and that a shock would kill him
so much he had learned from dr
mortimer
he had heard also that sir charles was superstitious and had taken this grim legend very seriously
his ingenious mind instantly suggested a way by which the baronet could be done to death and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the guilt to the real murderer
having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with considerable finesse
an ordinary schemer would have been content to work with a savage hound
the use of artificial means to make the creature diabolical was a flash of genius upon his part
the dog he bought in london from ross and mangles the dealers in fulham road
it was the strongest and most savage in their possession
he brought it down by the north devon line and walked a great distance over the moor so as to get it home without exciting any remarks
he had already on his insect hunts learned to penetrate the grimpen mire and so had found a safe hiding place for the creature
here he kennelled it and waited his chance
but it was some time coming
the old gentleman could not be decoyed outside of his grounds at night
several times stapleton lurked about with his hound but without avail
it was during these fruitless quests that he or rather his ally was seen by peasants and that the legend of the demon dog received a new confirmation
he had hoped that his wife might lure sir charles to his ruin but here she proved unexpectedly independent
she would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in a sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy
threats and even i am sorry to say blows refused to move her
she would have nothing to do with it and for a time stapleton was at a deadlock
he found a way out of his difficulties through the chance that sir charles who had conceived a friendship for him made him the minister of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman mrs
laura lyons
by representing himself as a single man he acquired complete influence over her and he gave her to understand that in the event of her obtaining a divorce from her husband he would marry her
his plans were suddenly brought to a head by his knowledge that sir charles was about to leave the hall on the advice of dr
mortimer with whose opinion he himself pretended to coincide
he must act at once or his victim might get beyond his power
he therefore put pressure upon mrs
lyons to write this letter imploring the old man to give her an interview on the evening before his departure for london
he then by a specious argument prevented her from going and so had the chance for which he had waited
driving back in the evening from coombe tracey he was in time to get his hound to treat it with his infernal paint and to bring the beast round to the gate at which he had reason to expect that he would find the old gentleman waiting
the dog incited by its master sprang over the wicket gate and pursued the unfortunate baronet who fled screaming down the yew alley
in that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have been a dreadful sight to see that huge black creature with its flaming jaws and blazing eyes bounding after its victim
he fell dead at the end of the alley from heart disease and terror
the hound had kept upon the grassy border while the baronet had run down the path so that no track but the man's was visible
on seeing him lying still the creature had probably approached to sniff at him but finding him dead had turned away again
it was then that it left the print which was actually observed by dr
mortimer
the hound was called off and hurried away to its lair in the grimpen mire and a mystery was left which puzzled the authorities alarmed the countryside and finally brought the case within the scope of our observation
so much for the death of sir charles baskerville
you perceive the devilish cunning of it for really it would be almost impossible to make a case against the real murderer
his only accomplice was one who could never give him away and the grotesque inconceivable nature of the device only served to make it more effective
both of the women concerned in the case mrs
stapleton and mrs
laura lyons were left with a strong suspicion against stapleton
mrs
stapleton knew that he had designs upon the old man and also of the existence of the hound
mrs
lyons knew neither of these things but had been impressed by the death occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was only known to him
however both of them were under his influence and he had nothing to fear from them
the first half of his task was successfully accomplished but the more difficult still remained
it is possible that stapleton did not know of the existence of an heir in canada
in any case he would very soon learn it from his friend dr
mortimer and he was told by the latter all details about the arrival of henry baskerville
stapleton's first idea was that this young stranger from canada might possibly be done to death in london without coming down to devonshire at all
he distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in laying a trap for the old man and he dared not leave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her
it was for this reason that he took her to london with him
they lodged i find at the mexborough private hotel in craven street which was actually one of those called upon by my agent in search of evidence
here he kept his wife imprisoned in her room while he disguised in a beard followed dr
mortimer to baker street and afterwards to the station and to the northumberland hotel
his wife had some inkling of his plans but she had such a fear of her husband a fear founded upon brutal ill treatment that she dare not write to warn the man whom she knew to be in danger
if the letter should fall into stapleton's hands her own life would not be safe
eventually as we know she adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would form the message and addressing the letter in a disguised hand
it reached the baronet and gave him the first warning of his danger
it was very essential for stapleton to get some article of sir henry's attire so that in case he was driven to use the dog he might always have the means of setting him upon his track
with characteristic promptness and audacity he set about this at once and we cannot doubt that the boots or chamber maid of the hotel was well bribed to help him in his design
by chance however the first boot which was procured for him was a new one and therefore useless for his purpose
he then had it returned and obtained another a most instructive incident since it proved conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an old boot and this indifference to a new one
the more outre and grotesque an incident is the more carefully it deserves to be examined and the very point which appears to complicate a case is when duly considered and scientifically handled the one which is most likely to elucidate it
then we had the visit from our friends next morning shadowed always by stapleton in the cab
from his knowledge of our rooms and of my appearance as well as from his general conduct i am inclined to think that stapleton's career of crime has been by no means limited to this single baskerville affair
it is suggestive that during the last three years there have been four considerable burglaries in the west country for none of which was any criminal ever arrested
the last of these at folkestone court in may was remarkable for the cold blooded pistolling of the page who surprised the masked and solitary burglar
i cannot doubt that stapleton recruited his waning resources in this fashion and that for years he has been a desperate and dangerous man
we had an example of his readiness of resource that morning when he got away from us so successfully and also of his audacity in sending back my own name to me through the cabman
from that moment he understood that i had taken over the case in london and that therefore there was no chance for him there
he returned to dartmoor and awaited the arrival of the baronet
one moment
said i
you have no doubt described the sequence of events correctly but there is one point which you have left unexplained
what became of the hound when its master was in london
i have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubtedly of importance
there can be no question that stapleton had a confidant though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in his power by sharing all his plans with him
there was an old manservant at merripit house whose name was anthony
his connection with the stapletons can be traced for several years as far back as the school mastering days so that he must have been aware that his master and mistress were really husband and wife
this man has disappeared and has escaped from the country
it is suggestive that anthony is not a common name in england while antonio is so in all spanish or spanish american countries
the man like mrs
stapleton herself spoke good english but with a curious lisping accent
i have myself seen this old man cross the grimpen mire by the path which stapleton had marked out
it is very probable therefore that in the absence of his master it was he who cared for the hound though he may never have known the purpose for which the beast was used
the stapletons then went down to devonshire whither they were soon followed by sir henry and you
one word now as to how i stood myself at that time
it may possibly recur to your memory that when i examined the paper upon which the printed words were fastened i made a close inspection for the water mark
in doing so i held it within a few inches of my eyes and was conscious of a faint smell of the scent known as white jessamine
there are seventy five perfumes which it is very necessary that a criminal expert should be able to distinguish from each other and cases have more than once within my own experience depended upon their prompt recognition
the scent suggested the presence of a lady and already my thoughts began to turn towards the stapletons
thus i had made certain of the hound and had guessed at the criminal before ever we went to the west country
it was my game to watch stapleton
it was evident however that i could not do this if i were with you since he would be keenly on his guard
i deceived everybody therefore yourself included and i came down secretly when i was supposed to be in london
my hardships were not so great as you imagined though such trifling details must never interfere with the investigation of a case
i stayed for the most part at coombe tracey and only used the hut upon the moor when it was necessary to be near the scene of action
cartwright had come down with me and in his disguise as a country boy he was of great assistance to me
i was dependent upon him for food and clean linen
when i was watching stapleton cartwright was frequently watching you so that i was able to keep my hand upon all the strings
i have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly being forwarded instantly from baker street to coombe tracey
they were of great service to me and especially that one incidentally truthful piece of biography of stapleton's
i was able to establish the identity of the man and the woman and knew at last exactly how i stood
the case had been considerably complicated through the incident of the escaped convict and the relations between him and the barrymores
this also you cleared up in a very effective way though i had already come to the same conclusions from my own observations
by the time that you discovered me upon the moor i had a complete knowledge of the whole business but i had not a case which could go to a jury
even stapleton's attempt upon sir henry that night which ended in the death of the unfortunate convict did not help us much in proving murder against our man
there seemed to be no alternative but to catch him red handed and to do so we had to use sir henry alone and apparently unprotected as a bait
we did so and at the cost of a severe shock to our client we succeeded in completing our case and driving stapleton to his destruction
that sir henry should have been exposed to this is i must confess a reproach to my management of the case but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing spectacle which the beast presented nor could we predict the fog which enabled him to burst upon us at such short notice
we succeeded in our object at a cost which both the specialist and dr
mortimer assure me will be a temporary one
a long journey may enable our friend to recover not only from his shattered nerves but also from his wounded feelings
his love for the lady was deep and sincere and to him the saddest part of all this black business was that he should have been deceived by her
it only remains to indicate the part which she had played throughout
there can be no doubt that stapleton exercised an influence over her which may have been love or may have been fear or very possibly both since they are by no means incompatible emotions
it was at least absolutely effective
at his command she consented to pass as his sister though he found the limits of his power over her when he endeavoured to make her the direct accessory to murder
she was ready to warn sir henry so far as she could without implicating her husband and again and again she tried to do so
stapleton himself seems to have been capable of jealousy and when he saw the baronet paying court to the lady even though it was part of his own plan still he could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst which revealed the fiery soul which his self contained manner so cleverly concealed
by encouraging the intimacy he made it certain that sir henry would frequently come to merripit house and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he desired
on the day of the crisis however his wife turned suddenly against him
she had learned something of the death of the convict and she knew that the hound was being kept in the outhouse on the evening that sir henry was coming to dinner
she taxed her husband with his intended crime and a furious scene followed in which he showed her for the first time that she had a rival in his love
her fidelity turned in an instant to bitter hatred and he saw that she would betray him
he tied her up therefore that she might have no chance of warning sir henry and he hoped no doubt that when the whole countryside put down the baronet's death to the curse of his family as they certainly would do he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished fact and to keep silent upon what she knew
in this i fancy that in any case he made a miscalculation and that if we had not been there his doom would none the less have been sealed
a woman of spanish blood does not condone such an injury so lightly
and now my dear watson without referring to my notes i cannot give you a more detailed account of this curious case
i do not know that anything essential has been left unexplained
he could not hope to frighten sir henry to death as he had done the old uncle with his bogie hound
the beast was savage and half starved
if its appearance did not frighten its victim to death at least it would paralyze the resistance which might be offered
no doubt
there only remains one difficulty
if stapleton came into the succession how could he explain the fact that he the heir had been living unannounced under another name so close to the property
how could he claim it without causing suspicion and inquiry
it is a formidable difficulty and i fear that you ask too much when you expect me to solve it
the past and the present are within the field of my inquiry but what a man may do in the future is a hard question to answer
mrs
stapleton has heard her husband discuss the problem on several occasions
there were three possible courses
he might claim the property from south america establish his identity before the british authorities there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to england at all or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short time that he need be in london or again he might furnish an accomplice with the proofs and papers putting him in as heir and retaining a claim upon some proportion of his income
we cannot doubt from what we know of him that he would have found some way out of the difficulty
and now my dear watson we have had some weeks of severe work and for one evening i think we may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels
i have a box for 'les huguenots '
have you heard the de reszkes
might i trouble you then to be ready in half an hour and we can stop at marcini's for a little dinner on the way
we were seated at breakfast one morning my wife and i when the maid brought in a telegram
it was from sherlock holmes and ran in this way have you a couple of days to spare
have just been wired for from the west of england in connection with boscombe valley tragedy
shall be glad if you will come with me
air and scenery perfect
leave paddington by the
what do you say dear
said my wife looking across at me
will you go
i really don't know what to say
i have a fairly long list at present
oh anstruther would do your work for you
you have been looking a little pale lately
i think that the change would do you good and you are always so interested in mr
sherlock holmes' cases
i should be ungrateful if i were not seeing what i gained through one of them i answered
but if i am to go i must pack at once for i have only half an hour
my experience of camp life in afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller
my wants were few and simple so that in less than the time stated i was in a cab with my valise rattling away to paddington station
sherlock holmes was pacing up and down the platform his tall gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling cloak and close fitting cloth cap
it is really very good of you to come watson said he
it makes a considerable difference to me having someone with me on whom i can thoroughly rely
local aid is always either worthless or else biassed
if you will keep the two corner seats i shall get the tickets
we had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which holmes had brought with him
among these he rummaged and read with intervals of note taking and of meditation until we were past reading
then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack
have you heard anything of the case
he asked
not a word
i have not seen a paper for some days
the london press has not had very full accounts
i have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars
it seems from what i gather to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult
that sounds a little paradoxical
but it is profoundly true
singularity is almost invariably a clue
the more featureless and commonplace a crime is the more difficult it is to bring it home
in this case however they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man
it is a murder then
well it is conjectured to be so
i shall take nothing for granted until i have the opportunity of looking personally into it
i will explain the state of things to you as far as i have been able to understand it in a very few words
boscombe valley is a country district not very far from ross in herefordshire
the largest landed proprietor in that part is a mr
john turner who made his money in australia and returned some years ago to the old country
one of the farms which he held that of hatherley was let to mr
charles mccarthy who was also an ex australian
the men had known each other in the colonies so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible
turner was apparently the richer man so mccarthy became his tenant but still remained it seems upon terms of perfect equality as they were frequently together
mccarthy had one son a lad of eighteen and turner had an only daughter of the same age but neither of them had wives living
they appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring english families and to have led retired lives though both the mccarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race meetings of the neighbourhood
mccarthy kept two servants a man and a girl
turner had a considerable household some half dozen at the least
that is as much as i have been able to gather about the families
now for the facts
on june 3rd that is on monday last mccarthy left his house at hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the boscombe pool which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the boscombe valley
he had been out with his serving man in the morning at ross and he had told the man that he must hurry as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three
from that appointment he never came back alive
from hatherley farm house to the boscombe pool is a quarter of a mile and two people saw him as he passed over this ground
one was an old woman whose name is not mentioned and the other was william crowder a game keeper in the employ of mr
turner
both these witnesses depose that mr
mccarthy was walking alone
the game keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing mr
mccarthy pass he had seen his son mr
james mccarthy going the same way with a gun under his arm
to the best of his belief the father was actually in sight at the time and the son was following him
he thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred
the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder the game keeper lost sight of them
the boscombe pool is thickly wooded round with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge
a girl of fourteen patience moran who is the daughter of the lodge keeper of the boscombe valley estate was in one of the woods picking flowers
she states that while she was there she saw at the border of the wood and close by the lake mr
mccarthy and his son and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel
she heard mr
mccarthy the elder using very strong language to his son and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father
she was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two mccarthys quarrelling near boscombe pool and that she was afraid that they were going to fight
she had hardly said the words when young mr
mccarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood and to ask for the help of the lodge keeper
he was much excited without either his gun or his hat and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood
on following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool
the head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon
the injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt end of his son's gun which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body
under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned at the inquest on tuesday he was on wednesday brought before the magistrates at ross who have referred the case to the next assizes
those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police court
i could hardly imagine a more damning case i remarked
if ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here
circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing answered holmes thoughtfully
it may seem to point very straight to one thing but if you shift your own point of view a little you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different
it must be confessed however that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit
there are several people in the neighbourhood however and among them miss turner the daughter of the neighbouring landowner who believe in his innocence and who have retained lestrade whom you may recollect in connection with the study in scarlet to work out the case in his interest
lestrade being rather puzzled has referred the case to me and hence it is that two middle aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home
i am afraid said i that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case
there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact he answered laughing
besides we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to mr
lestrade
you know me too well to think that i am boasting when i say that i shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing or even of understanding
to take the first example to hand i very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right hand side and yet i question whether mr
lestrade would have noted even so self evident a thing as that
how on earth my dear fellow i know you well
i know the military neatness which characterises you
you shave every morning and in this season you shave by the sunlight but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other
i could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result
i only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference
therein lies my metier and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us
there are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest and which are worth considering
what are they
it appears that his arrest did not take place at once but after the return to hatherley farm
on the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it and that it was no more than his deserts
this observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner's jury
it was a confession i ejaculated
no for it was followed by a protestation of innocence
coming on the top of such a damning series of events it was at least a most suspicious remark
on the contrary said holmes it is the brightest rift which i can at present see in the clouds
however innocent he might be he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him
had he appeared surprised at his own arrest or feigned indignation at it i should have looked upon it as highly suspicious because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man
his frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man or else as a man of considerable self restraint and firmness
as to his remark about his deserts it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him and even according to the little girl whose evidence is so important to raise his hand as if to strike him
the self reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one
i shook my head
many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence i remarked
so they have
and many men have been wrongfully hanged
what is the young man's own account of the matter
it is i am afraid not very encouraging to his supporters though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive
you will find it here and may read it for yourself
he picked out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire paper and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred
i settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully
it ran in this way mr
james mccarthy the only son of the deceased was then called and gave evidence as follows 'i had been away from home for three days at bristol and had only just returned upon the morning of last monday the 3rd
my father was absent from home at the time of my arrival and i was informed by the maid that he had driven over to ross with john cobb the groom
shortly after my return i heard the wheels of his trap in the yard and looking out of my window i saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard though i was not aware in which direction he was going
i then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the boscombe pool with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side
on my way i saw william crowder the game keeper as he had stated in his evidence but he is mistaken in thinking that i was following my father
i had no idea that he was in front of me
when about a hundred yards from the pool i heard a cry of cooee
which was a usual signal between my father and myself
i then hurried forward and found him standing by the pool
he appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what i was doing there
a conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows for my father was a man of a very violent temper
seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable i left him and returned towards hatherley farm
i had not gone more than yards however when i heard a hideous outcry behind me which caused me to run back again
i found my father expiring upon the ground with his head terribly injured
i dropped my gun and held him in my arms but he almost instantly expired
i knelt beside him for some minutes and then made my way to mr
turner's lodge keeper his house being the nearest to ask for assistance
i saw no one near my father when i returned and i have no idea how he came by his injuries
he was not a popular man being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners but he had as far as i know no active enemies
i know nothing further of the matter '
the coroner did your father make any statement to you before he died
witness he mumbled a few words but i could only catch some allusion to a rat
the coroner what did you understand by that
witness it conveyed no meaning to me
i thought that he was delirious
the coroner what was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel
witness i should prefer not to answer
the coroner i am afraid that i must press it
witness it is really impossible for me to tell you
i can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed
the coroner that is for the court to decide
i need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise
witness i must still refuse
the coroner i understand that the cry of 'cooee' was a common signal between you and your father
witness it was
the coroner how was it then that he uttered it before he saw you and before he even knew that you had returned from bristol
witness with considerable confusion i do not know
a juryman did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured
witness nothing definite
the coroner what do you mean
witness i was so disturbed and excited as i rushed out into the open that i could think of nothing except of my father
yet i have a vague impression that as i ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me
it seemed to me to be something grey in colour a coat of some sort or a plaid perhaps
when i rose from my father i looked round for it but it was gone
'do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help '
'yes it was gone '
'you cannot say what it was '
'no i had a feeling something was there '
'how far from the body '
'a dozen yards or so '
'and how far from the edge of the wood '
'about the same '
'then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it '
'yes but with my back towards it '
this concluded the examination of the witness
i see said i as i glanced down the column that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy
he calls attention and with reason to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father and his singular account of his father's dying words
they are all as he remarks very much against the son
holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat
both you and the coroner have been at some pains said he to single out the very strongest points in the young man's favour
don't you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little
too little if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury too much if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outre as a dying reference to a rat and the incident of the vanishing cloth
no sir i shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us
and now here is my pocket petrarch and not another word shall i say of this case until we are on the scene of action
we lunch at swindon and i see that we shall be there in twenty minutes
it was nearly four o'clock when we at last after passing through the beautiful stroud valley and over the broad gleaming severn found ourselves at the pretty little country town of ross
a lean ferret like man furtive and sly looking was waiting for us upon the platform
in spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings i had no difficulty in recognising lestrade of scotland yard
with him we drove to the hereford arms where a room had already been engaged for us
i have ordered a carriage said lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea
i knew your energetic nature and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime
it was very nice and complimentary of you holmes answered
it is entirely a question of barometric pressure
lestrade looked startled
i do not quite follow he said
how is the glass
twenty nine i see
no wind and not a cloud in the sky
i have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination
i do not think that it is probable that i shall use the carriage to night
lestrade laughed indulgently
you have no doubt already formed your conclusions from the newspapers he said
the case is as plain as a pikestaff and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes
still of course one can't refuse a lady and such a very positive one too
she has heard of you and would have your opinion though i repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which i had not already done
why bless my soul
here is her carriage at the door
he had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that i have ever seen in my life
her violet eyes shining her lips parted a pink flush upon her cheeks all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern
oh mr
sherlock holmes
she cried glancing from one to the other of us and finally with a woman's quick intuition fastening upon my companion i am so glad that you have come
i have driven down to tell you so
i know that james didn't do it
i know it and i want you to start upon your work knowing it too
never let yourself doubt upon that point
we have known each other since we were little children and i know his faults as no one else does but he is too tender hearted to hurt a fly
such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him
i hope we may clear him miss turner said sherlock holmes
you may rely upon my doing all that i can
but you have read the evidence
you have formed some conclusion
do you not see some loophole some flaw
do you not yourself think that he is innocent
i think that it is very probable
there now
she cried throwing back her head and looking defiantly at lestrade
you hear
he gives me hopes
lestrade shrugged his shoulders
i am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions he said
but he is right
oh
i know that he is right
james never did it
and about his quarrel with his father i am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because i was concerned in it
in what way
asked holmes
it is no time for me to hide anything
james and his father had many disagreements about me
mr
mccarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us
james and i have always loved each other as brother and sister but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet and and well he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet
so there were quarrels and this i am sure was one of them
and your father
asked holmes
was he in favour of such a union
no he was averse to it also
no one but mr
mccarthy was in favour of it
a quick blush passed over her fresh young face as holmes shot one of his keen questioning glances at her
thank you for this information said he
may i see your father if i call to morrow
i am afraid the doctor won't allow it
the doctor
yes have you not heard
poor father has never been strong for years back but this has broken him down completely
he has taken to his bed and dr
willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered
mr
mccarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in victoria
ha
in victoria
that is important
yes at the mines
quite so at the gold mines where as i understand mr
turner made his money
yes certainly
thank you miss turner
you have been of material assistance to me
you will tell me if you have any news to morrow
no doubt you will go to the prison to see james
oh if you do mr
holmes do tell him that i know him to be innocent
i will miss turner
i must go home now for dad is very ill and he misses me so if i leave him
good bye and god help you in your undertaking
she hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street
i am ashamed of you holmes said lestrade with dignity after a few minutes' silence
why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint
i am not over tender of heart but i call it cruel
i think that i see my way to clearing james mccarthy said holmes
have you an order to see him in prison
yes but only for you and me
then i shall reconsider my resolution about going out
we have still time to take a train to hereford and see him to night
ample
then let us do so
watson i fear that you will find it very slow but i shall only be away a couple of hours
i walked down to the station with them and then wandered through the streets of the little town finally returning to the hotel where i lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow backed novel
the puny plot of the story was so thin however when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping and i found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact that i at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day
supposing that this unhappy young man's story were absolutely true then what hellish thing what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father and the moment when drawn back by his screams he rushed into the glade
it was something terrible and deadly
what could it be
might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts
i rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper which contained a verbatim account of the inquest
in the surgeon's deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon
i marked the spot upon my own head
clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind
that was to some extent in favour of the accused as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father
still it did not go for very much for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell
still it might be worth while to call holmes' attention to it
then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat
what could that mean
it could not be delirium
a man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious
no it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate
but what could it indicate
i cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation
and then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young mccarthy
if that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress presumably his overcoat in his flight and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off
what a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was
i did not wonder at lestrade's opinion and yet i had so much faith in sherlock holmes' insight that i could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young mccarthy's innocence
it was late before sherlock holmes returned
he came back alone for lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town
the glass still keeps very high he remarked as he sat down
it is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground
on the other hand a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that and i did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey
i have seen young mccarthy
and what did you learn from him
nothing
could he throw no light
none at all
i was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her but i am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else
he is not a very quick witted youth though comely to look at and i should think sound at heart
i cannot admire his taste i remarked if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this miss turner
ah thereby hangs a rather painful tale
this fellow is madly insanely in love with her but some two years ago when he was only a lad and before he really knew her for she had been away five years at a boarding school what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in bristol and marry her at a registry office
no one knows a word of the matter but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do but what he knows to be absolutely impossible
it was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father at their last interview was goading him on to propose to miss turner
on the other hand he had no means of supporting himself and his father who was by all accounts a very hard man would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth
it was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in bristol and his father did not know where he was
mark that point
it is of importance
good has come out of evil however for the barmaid finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the bermuda dockyard so that there is really no tie between them
i think that that bit of news has consoled young mccarthy for all that he has suffered
but if he is innocent who has done it
ah
who
i would call your attention very particularly to two points
one is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool and that the someone could not have been his son for his son was away and he did not know when he would return
the second is that the murdered man was heard to cry 'cooee '
before he knew that his son had returned
those are the crucial points upon which the case depends
and now let us talk about george meredith if you please and we shall leave all minor matters until to morrow
there was no rain as holmes had foretold and the morning broke bright and cloudless
at nine o'clock lestrade called for us with the carriage and we set off for hatherley farm and the boscombe pool
there is serious news this morning lestrade observed
it is said that mr
turner of the hall is so ill that his life is despaired of
an elderly man i presume
said holmes
about sixty but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad and he has been in failing health for some time
this business has had a very bad effect upon him
he was an old friend of mccarthy's and i may add a great benefactor to him for i have learned that he gave him hatherley farm rent free
indeed
that is interesting said holmes
oh yes
in a hundred other ways he has helped him
everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him
really
does it not strike you as a little singular that this mccarthy who appears to have had little of his own and to have been under such obligations to turner should still talk of marrying his son to turner's daughter who is presumably heiress to the estate and that in such a very cocksure manner as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow
it is the more strange since we know that turner himself was averse to the idea
the daughter told us as much
do you not deduce something from that
we have got to the deductions and the inferences said lestrade winking at me
i find it hard enough to tackle facts holmes without flying away after theories and fancies
you are right said holmes demurely you do find it very hard to tackle the facts
anyhow i have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of replied lestrade with some warmth
and that is that mccarthy senior met his death from mccarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine
well moonshine is a brighter thing than fog said holmes laughing
but i am very much mistaken if this is not hatherley farm upon the left
yes that is it
it was a widespread comfortable looking building two storied slate roofed with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls
the drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys however gave it a stricken look as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it
we called at the door when the maid at holmes' request showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death and also a pair of the son's though not the pair which he had then had
having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points holmes desired to be led to the court yard from which we all followed the winding track which led to boscombe pool
sherlock holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this
men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of baker street would have failed to recognise him
his face flushed and darkened
his brows were drawn into two hard black lines while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter
his face was bent downward his shoulders bowed his lips compressed and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long sinewy neck
his nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears or at the most only provoked a quick impatient snarl in reply
swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows and so by way of the woods to the boscombe pool
it was damp marshy ground as is all that district and there were marks of many feet both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side
sometimes holmes would hurry on sometimes stop dead and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow
lestrade and i walked behind him the detective indifferent and contemptuous while i watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end
the boscombe pool which is a little reed girt sheet of water some fifty yards across is situated at the boundary between the hatherley farm and the private park of the wealthy mr
turner
above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner's dwelling
on the hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake
lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found and indeed so moist was the ground that i could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man
to holmes as i could see by his eager face and peering eyes very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass
he ran round like a dog who is picking up a scent and then turned upon my companion
what did you go into the pool for
he asked
i fished about with a rake
i thought there might be some weapon or other trace
but how on earth oh tut tut
i have no time
that left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place
a mole could trace it and there it vanishes among the reeds
oh how simple it would all have been had i been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it
here is where the party with the lodge keeper came and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body
but here are three separate tracks of the same feet
he drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view talking all the time rather to himself than to us
these are young mccarthy's feet
twice he was walking and once he ran swiftly so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible
that bears out his story
he ran when he saw his father on the ground
then here are the father's feet as he paced up and down
what is this then
it is the butt end of the gun as the son stood listening
and this
ha ha
what have we here
tiptoes
tiptoes
square too quite unusual boots
they come they go they come again of course that was for the cloak
now where did they come from
he ran up and down sometimes losing sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech the largest tree in the neighbourhood
holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction
for a long time he remained there turning over the leaves and dried sticks gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach
a jagged stone was lying among the moss and this also he carefully examined and retained
then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad where all traces were lost
it has been a case of considerable interest he remarked returning to his natural manner
i fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge
i think that i will go in and have a word with moran and perhaps write a little note
having done that we may drive back to our luncheon
you may walk to the cab and i shall be with you presently
it was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into ross holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood
this may interest you lestrade he remarked holding it out
the murder was done with it
i see no marks
there are none
how do you know then
the grass was growing under it
it had only lain there a few days
there was no sign of a place whence it had been taken
it corresponds with the injuries
there is no sign of any other weapon
and the murderer
is a tall man left handed limps with the right leg wears thick soled shooting boots and a grey cloak smokes indian cigars uses a cigar holder and carries a blunt pen knife in his pocket
there are several other indications but these may be enough to aid us in our search
lestrade laughed
i am afraid that i am still a sceptic he said
theories are all very well but we have to deal with a hard headed british jury
nous verrons answered holmes calmly
you work your own method and i shall work mine
i shall be busy this afternoon and shall probably return to london by the evening train
and leave your case unfinished
no finished
but the mystery
it is solved
who was the criminal then
the gentleman i describe
but who is he
surely it would not be difficult to find out
this is not such a populous neighbourhood
lestrade shrugged his shoulders
i am a practical man he said and i really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left handed gentleman with a game leg
i should become the laughing stock of scotland yard
all right said holmes quietly
i have given you the chance
here are your lodgings
good bye
i shall drop you a line before i leave
having left lestrade at his rooms we drove to our hotel where we found lunch upon the table
holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face as one who finds himself in a perplexing position
look here watson he said when the cloth was cleared just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little
i don't know quite what to do and i should value your advice
light a cigar and let me expound
pray do so
well now in considering this case there are two points about young mccarthy's narrative which struck us both instantly although they impressed me in his favour and you against him
one was the fact that his father should according to his account cry 'cooee '
before seeing him
the other was his singular dying reference to a rat
he mumbled several words you understand but that was all that caught the son's ear
now from this double point our research must commence and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true
what of this 'cooee '
then
well obviously it could not have been meant for the son
the son as far as he knew was in bristol
it was mere chance that he was within earshot
the 'cooee '
was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with
but 'cooee' is a distinctly australian cry and one which is used between australians
there is a strong presumption that the person whom mccarthy expected to meet him at boscombe pool was someone who had been in australia
what of the rat then
sherlock holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table
this is a map of the colony of victoria he said
i wired to bristol for it last night
he put his hand over part of the map
what do you read
arat i read
and now
he raised his hand
ballarat
quite so
that was the word the man uttered and of which his son only caught the last two syllables
he was trying to utter the name of his murderer
so and so of ballarat
it is wonderful
i exclaimed
it is obvious
and now you see i had narrowed the field down considerably
the possession of a grey garment was a third point which granting the son's statement to be correct was a certainty
we have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an australian from ballarat with a grey cloak
certainly
and one who was at home in the district for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate where strangers could hardly wander
quite so
then comes our expedition of to day
by an examination of the ground i gained the trifling details which i gave to that imbecile lestrade as to the personality of the criminal
but how did you gain them
you know my method
it is founded upon the observation of trifles
his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride
his boots too might be told from their traces
yes they were peculiar boots
but his lameness
the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left
he put less weight upon it
why
because he limped he was lame
but his left handedness
you were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest
the blow was struck from immediately behind and yet was upon the left side
now how can that be unless it were by a left handed man
he had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son
he had even smoked there
i found the ash of a cigar which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an indian cigar
i have as you know devoted some attention to this and written a little monograph on the ashes of different varieties of pipe cigar and cigarette tobacco
having found the ash i then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it
it was an indian cigar of the variety which are rolled in rotterdam
and the cigar holder
i could see that the end had not been in his mouth
therefore he used a holder
the tip had been cut off not bitten off but the cut was not a clean one so i deduced a blunt pen knife
holmes i said you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him
i see the direction in which all this points
the culprit is mr
john turner cried the hotel waiter opening the door of our sitting room and ushering in a visitor
the man who entered was a strange and impressive figure
his slow limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude and yet his hard deep lined craggy features and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character
his tangled beard grizzled hair and outstanding drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance but his face was of an ashen white while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue
it was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease
pray sit down on the sofa said holmes gently
you had my note
yes the lodge keeper brought it up
you said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal
i thought people would talk if i went to the hall
and why did you wish to see me
he looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes as though his question was already answered
yes said holmes answering the look rather than the words
it is so
i know all about mccarthy
the old man sank his face in his hands
god help me
he cried
but i would not have let the young man come to harm
i give you my word that i would have spoken out if it went against him at the assizes
i am glad to hear you say so said holmes gravely
i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl
it would break her heart it will break her heart when she hears that i am arrested
it may not come to that said holmes
what
i am no official agent
i understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here and i am acting in her interests
young mccarthy must be got off however
i am a dying man said old turner
i have had diabetes for years
my doctor says it is a question whether i shall live a month
yet i would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol
holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him
just tell us the truth he said
i shall jot down the facts
you will sign it and watson here can witness it
then i could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young mccarthy
i promise you that i shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed
it's as well said the old man it's a question whether i shall live to the assizes so it matters little to me but i should wish to spare alice the shock
and now i will make the thing clear to you it has been a long time in the acting but will not take me long to tell
you didn't know this dead man mccarthy
he was a devil incarnate
i tell you that
god keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he
his grip has been upon me these twenty years and he has blasted my life
i'll tell you first how i came to be in his power
it was in the early ' 's at the diggings
i was a young chap then hot blooded and reckless ready to turn my hand at anything i got among bad companions took to drink had no luck with my claim took to the bush and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber
there were six of us and we had a wild free life of it sticking up a station from time to time or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings
black jack of ballarat was the name i went under and our party is still remembered in the colony as the ballarat gang
one day a gold convoy came down from ballarat to melbourne and we lay in wait for it and attacked it
there were six troopers and six of us so it was a close thing but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley
three of our boys were killed however before we got the swag
i put my pistol to the head of the wagon driver who was this very man mccarthy
i wish to the lord that i had shot him then but i spared him though i saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face as though to remember every feature
we got away with the gold became wealthy men and made our way over to england without being suspected
there i parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life
i bought this estate which chanced to be in the market and i set myself to do a little good with my money to make up for the way in which i had earned it
i married too and though my wife died young she left me my dear little alice
even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done
in a word i turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past
all was going well when mccarthy laid his grip upon me
i had gone up to town about an investment and i met him in regent street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot
'here we are jack ' says he touching me on the arm 'we'll be as good as a family to you
there's two of us me and my son and you can have the keeping of us
if you don't it's a fine law abiding country is england and there's always a policeman within hail '
well down they came to the west country there was no shaking them off and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since
there was no rest for me no peace no forgetfulness turn where i would there was his cunning grinning face at my elbow
it grew worse as alice grew up for he soon saw i was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police
whatever he wanted he must have and whatever it was i gave him without question land money houses until at last he asked a thing which i could not give
he asked for alice
his son you see had grown up and so had my girl and as i was known to be in weak health it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property
but there i was firm
i would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine not that i had any dislike to the lad but his blood was in him and that was enough
i stood firm
mccarthy threatened
i braved him to do his worst
we were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over
when i went down there i found him talking with his son so i smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone
but as i listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost
he was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets
it drove me mad to think that i and all that i held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this
could i not snap the bond
i was already a dying and a desperate man
though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb i knew that my own fate was sealed
but my memory and my girl
both could be saved if i could but silence that foul tongue
i did it mr
holmes
i would do it again
deeply as i have sinned i have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it
but that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than i could suffer
i struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast
his cry brought back his son but i had gained the cover of the wood though i was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which i had dropped in my flight
that is the true story gentlemen of all that occurred
well it is not for me to judge you said holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out
i pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation
i pray not sir
and what do you intend to do
in view of your health nothing
you are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the assizes
i will keep your confession and if mccarthy is condemned i shall be forced to use it
if not it shall never be seen by mortal eye and your secret whether you be alive or dead shall be safe with us
farewell then said the old man solemnly
your own deathbeds when they come will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine
tottering and shaking in all his giant frame he stumbled slowly from the room
god help us
said holmes after a long silence
why does fate play such tricks with poor helpless worms
i never hear of such a case as this that i do not think of baxter's words and say 'there but for the grace of god goes sherlock holmes '
james mccarthy was acquitted at the assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by holmes and submitted to the defending counsel
old turner lived for seven months after our interview but he is now dead and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past
when i glance over my notes and records of the sherlock holmes cases between the years ' and ' i am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave
some however have already gained publicity through the papers and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate
some too have baffled his analytical skill and would be as narratives beginnings without an ending while others have been but partially cleared up and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him
there is however one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that i am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been and probably never will be entirely cleared up
the year ' furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest of which i retain the records
among my headings under this one twelve months i find an account of the adventure of the paradol chamber of the amateur mendicant society who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse of the facts connected with the loss of the british barque sophy anderson of the singular adventures of the grice patersons in the island of uffa and finally of the camberwell poisoning case
in the latter as may be remembered sherlock holmes was able by winding up the dead man's watch to prove that it had been wound up two hours before and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case
all these i may sketch out at some future date but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which i have now taken up my pen to describe
it was in the latter days of september and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence
all day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows so that even here in the heart of great hand made london we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation like untamed beasts in a cage
as evening drew in the storm grew higher and louder and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney
sherlock holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross indexing his records of crime while i at the other was deep in one of clark russell's fine sea stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves
my wife was on a visit to her mother's and for a few days i was a dweller once more in my old quarters at baker street
why said i glancing up at my companion that was surely the bell
who could come to night
some friend of yours perhaps
except yourself i have none he answered
i do not encourage visitors
a client then
if so it is a serious case
nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour
but i take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady's
sherlock holmes was wrong in his conjecture however for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door
he stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit
come in
said he
the man who entered was young some two and twenty at the outside well groomed and trimly clad with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing
the streaming umbrella which he held in his hand and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come
he looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp and i could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety
i owe you an apology he said raising his golden pince nez to his eyes
i trust that i am not intruding
i fear that i have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber
give me your coat and umbrella said holmes
they may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently
you have come up from the south west i see
yes from horsham
that clay and chalk mixture which i see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive
i have come for advice
that is easily got
and help
that is not always so easy
i have heard of you mr
holmes
i heard from major prendergast how you saved him in the tankerville club scandal
ah of course
he was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards
he said that you could solve anything
he said too much
that you are never beaten
i have been beaten four times three times by men and once by a woman
but what is that compared with the number of your successes
it is true that i have been generally successful
then you may be so with me
i beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case
it is no ordinary one
none of those which come to me are
i am the last court of appeal
and yet i question sir whether in all your experience you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family
you fill me with interest said holmes
pray give us the essential facts from the commencement and i can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important
the young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze
my name said he is john openshaw but my own affairs have as far as i can understand little to do with this awful business
it is a hereditary matter so in order to give you an idea of the facts i must go back to the commencement of the affair
you must know that my grandfather had two sons my uncle elias and my father joseph
my father had a small factory at coventry which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling
he was a patentee of the openshaw unbreakable tire and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence
my uncle elias emigrated to america when he was a young man and became a planter in florida where he was reported to have done very well
at the time of the war he fought in jackson's army and afterwards under hood where he rose to be a colonel
when lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation where he remained for three or four years
about or he came back to europe and took a small estate in sussex near horsham
he had made a very considerable fortune in the states and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes and his dislike of the republican policy in extending the franchise to them
he was a singular man fierce and quick tempered very foul mouthed when he was angry and of a most retiring disposition
during all the years that he lived at horsham i doubt if ever he set foot in the town
he had a garden and two or three fields round his house and there he would take his exercise though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room
he drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily but he would see no society and did not want any friends not even his own brother
he didn't mind me in fact he took a fancy to me for at the time when he saw me first i was a youngster of twelve or so
this would be in the year after he had been eight or nine years in england
he begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way
when he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople so that by the time that i was sixteen i was quite master of the house
i kept all the keys and could go where i liked and do what i liked so long as i did not disturb him in his privacy
there was one singular exception however for he had a single room a lumber room up among the attics which was invariably locked and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter
with a boy's curiosity i have peeped through the keyhole but i was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room
one day it was in march a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel's plate
it was not a common thing for him to receive letters for his bills were all paid in ready money and he had no friends of any sort
'from india '
said he as he took it up 'pondicherry postmark
what can this be '
opening it hurriedly out there jumped five little dried orange pips which pattered down upon his plate
i began to laugh at this but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face
his lip had fallen his eyes were protruding his skin the colour of putty and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand 'k
k
k '
he shrieked and then 'my god my god my sins have overtaken me '
'what is it uncle '
i cried
'death ' said he and rising from the table he retired to his room leaving me palpitating with horror
i took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap just above the gum the letter k three times repeated
there was nothing else save the five dried pips
what could be the reason of his overpowering terror
i left the breakfast table and as i ascended the stair i met him coming down with an old rusty key which must have belonged to the attic in one hand and a small brass box like a cashbox in the other
'they may do what they like but i'll checkmate them still ' said he with an oath
'tell mary that i shall want a fire in my room to day and send down to fordham the horsham lawyer '
i did as he ordered and when the lawyer arrived i was asked to step up to the room
the fire was burning brightly and in the grate there was a mass of black fluffy ashes as of burned paper while the brass box stood open and empty beside it
as i glanced at the box i noticed with a start that upon the lid was printed the treble k which i had read in the morning upon the envelope
'i wish you john ' said my uncle 'to witness my will
i leave my estate with all its advantages and all its disadvantages to my brother your father whence it will no doubt descend to you
if you can enjoy it in peace well and good
if you find you cannot take my advice my boy and leave it to your deadliest enemy
i am sorry to give you such a two edged thing but i can't say what turn things are going to take
kindly sign the paper where mr
fordham shows you '
i signed the paper as directed and the lawyer took it away with him
the singular incident made as you may think the deepest impression upon me and i pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it
yet i could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives
i could see a change in my uncle however
he drank more than ever and he was less inclined for any sort of society
most of his time he would spend in his room with the door locked upon the inside but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand screaming out that he was afraid of no man and that he was not to be cooped up like a sheep in a pen by man or devil
when these hot fits were over however he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul
at such times i have seen his face even on a cold day glisten with moisture as though it were new raised from a basin
well to come to an end of the matter mr
holmes and not to abuse your patience there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back
we found him when we went to search for him face downward in a little green scummed pool which lay at the foot of the garden
there was no sign of any violence and the water was but two feet deep so that the jury having regard to his known eccentricity brought in a verdict of 'suicide '
but i who knew how he winced from the very thought of death had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it
the matter passed however and my father entered into possession of the estate and of some pounds which lay to his credit at the bank
one moment holmes interposed your statement is i foresee one of the most remarkable to which i have ever listened
let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter and the date of his supposed suicide
the letter arrived on march
his death was seven weeks later upon the night of may 2nd
thank you
pray proceed
when my father took over the horsham property he at my request made a careful examination of the attic which had been always locked up
we found the brass box there although its contents had been destroyed
on the inside of the cover was a paper label with the initials of k k k repeated upon it and 'letters memoranda receipts and a register' written beneath
these we presume indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by colonel openshaw
for the rest there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note books bearing upon my uncle's life in america
some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier
others were of a date during the reconstruction of the southern states and were mostly concerned with politics for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet bag politicians who had been sent down from the north
well it was the beginning of ' when my father came to live at horsham and all went as well as possible with us until the january of '
on the fourth day after the new year i heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast table
there he was sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one
he had always laughed at what he called my cock and bull story about the colonel but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself
'why what on earth does this mean john '
he stammered
my heart had turned to lead
'it is k k k ' said i
he looked inside the envelope
'so it is ' he cried
'here are the very letters
but what is this written above them '
'put the papers on the sundial ' i read peeping over his shoulder
'what papers
what sundial '
he asked
'the sundial in the garden
there is no other ' said i 'but the papers must be those that are destroyed '
'pooh '
said he gripping hard at his courage
'we are in a civilised land here and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind
where does the thing come from '
'from dundee ' i answered glancing at the postmark
'some preposterous practical joke ' said he
'what have i to do with sundials and papers
i shall take no notice of such nonsense '
'i should certainly speak to the police ' i said
'and be laughed at for my pains
nothing of the sort '
'then let me do so '
'no i forbid you
i won't have a fuss made about such nonsense '
it was in vain to argue with him for he was a very obstinate man
i went about however with a heart which was full of forebodings
on the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his major freebody who is in command of one of the forts upon portsdown hill
i was glad that he should go for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home
in that however i was in error
upon the second day of his absence i received a telegram from the major imploring me to come at once
my father had fallen over one of the deep chalk pits which abound in the neighbourhood and was lying senseless with a shattered skull
i hurried to him but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness
he had as it appears been returning from fareham in the twilight and as the country was unknown to him and the chalk pit unfenced the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of 'death from accidental causes '
carefully as i examined every fact connected with his death i was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder
there were no signs of violence no footmarks no robbery no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads
and yet i need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease and that i was well nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him
in this sinister way i came into my inheritance
you will ask me why i did not dispose of it
i answer because i was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle's life and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another
it was in january ' that my poor father met his end and two years and eight months have elapsed since then
during that time i have lived happily at horsham and i had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family and that it had ended with the last generation
i had begun to take comfort too soon however yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father
the young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips
this is the envelope he continued
the postmark is london eastern division
within are the very words which were upon my father's last message 'k
k
k
' and then 'put the papers on the sundial '
what have you done
asked holmes
nothing
nothing
to tell the truth he sank his face into his thin white hands i have felt helpless
i have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it
i seem to be in the grasp of some resistless inexorable evil which no foresight and no precautions can guard against
tut
tut
cried sherlock holmes
you must act man or you are lost
nothing but energy can save you
this is no time for despair
i have seen the police
ah
but they listened to my story with a smile
i am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents as the jury stated and were not to be connected with the warnings
holmes shook his clenched hands in the air
incredible imbecility
he cried
they have however allowed me a policeman who may remain in the house with me
has he come with you to night
no
his orders were to stay in the house
again holmes raved in the air
why did you come to me he cried and above all why did you not come at once
i did not know
it was only to day that i spoke to major prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you
it is really two days since you had the letter
we should have acted before this
you have no further evidence i suppose than that which you have placed before us no suggestive detail which might help us
there is one thing said john openshaw
he rummaged in his coat pocket and drawing out a piece of discoloured blue tinted paper he laid it out upon the table
i have some remembrance said he that on the day when my uncle burned the papers i observed that the small unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour
i found this single sheet upon the floor of his room and i am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has perhaps fluttered out from among the others and in that way has escaped destruction
beyond the mention of pips i do not see that it helps us much
i think myself that it is a page from some private diary
the writing is undoubtedly my uncle's
holmes moved the lamp and we both bent over the sheet of paper which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book
it was headed march and beneath were the following enigmatical notices 4th
hudson came
same old platform
7th
set the pips on mccauley paramore and john swain of st
augustine
9th
mccauley cleared
10th
john swain cleared
12th
visited paramore
all well
thank you
said holmes folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor
and now you must on no account lose another instant
we cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me
you must get home instantly and act
what shall i do
there is but one thing to do
it must be done at once
you must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described
you must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle and that this is the only one which remains
you must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them
having done this you must at once put the box out upon the sundial as directed
do you understand
entirely
do not think of revenge or anything of the sort at present
i think that we may gain that by means of the law but we have our web to weave while theirs is already woven
the first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you
the second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties
i thank you said the young man rising and pulling on his overcoat
you have given me fresh life and hope
i shall certainly do as you advise
do not lose an instant
and above all take care of yourself in the meanwhile for i do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger
how do you go back
by train from waterloo
it is not yet nine
the streets will be crowded so i trust that you may be in safety
and yet you cannot guard yourself too closely
i am armed
that is well
to morrow i shall set to work upon your case
i shall see you at horsham then
no your secret lies in london
it is there that i shall seek it
then i shall call upon you in a day or in two days with news as to the box and the papers
i shall take your advice in every particular
he shook hands with us and took his leave
outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows
this strange wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements blown in upon us like a sheet of sea weed in a gale and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more
sherlock holmes sat for some time in silence with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire
then he lit his pipe and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling
i think watson he remarked at last that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this
save perhaps the sign of four
well yes
save perhaps that
and yet this john openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the sholtos
but have you i asked formed any definite conception as to what these perils are
there can be no question as to their nature he answered
then what are they
who is this k k k and why does he pursue this unhappy family
sherlock holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair with his finger tips together
the ideal reasoner he remarked would when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it
as cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones both before and after
we have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to
problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses
to carry the art however to its highest pitch it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge and this in itself implies as you will readily see a possession of all knowledge which even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias is a somewhat rare accomplishment
it is not so impossible however that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work and this i have endeavoured in my case to do
if i remember rightly you on one occasion in the early days of our friendship defined my limits in a very precise fashion
yes i answered laughing
it was a singular document
philosophy astronomy and politics were marked at zero i remember
botany variable geology profound as regards the mud stains from any region within fifty miles of town chemistry eccentric anatomy unsystematic sensational literature and crime records unique violin player boxer swordsman lawyer and self poisoner by cocaine and tobacco
those i think were the main points of my analysis
holmes grinned at the last item
well he said i say now as i said then that a man should keep his little brain attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use and the rest he can put away in the lumber room of his library where he can get it if he wants it
now for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to night we need certainly to muster all our resources
kindly hand me down the letter k of the 'american encyclopaedia' which stands upon the shelf beside you
thank you
now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it
in the first place we may start with a strong presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving america
men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for the lonely life of an english provincial town
his extreme love of solitude in england suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from america
as to what it was he feared we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors
did you remark the postmarks of those letters
the first was from pondicherry the second from dundee and the third from london
from east london
what do you deduce from that
they are all seaports
that the writer was on board of a ship
excellent
we have already a clue
there can be no doubt that the probability the strong probability is that the writer was on board of a ship
and now let us consider another point
in the case of pondicherry seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment in dundee it was only some three or four days
does that suggest anything
a greater distance to travel
but the letter had also a greater distance to come
then i do not see the point
there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing ship
it looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission
you see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from dundee
if they had come from pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter
but as a matter of fact seven weeks elapsed
i think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer
it is possible
more than that
it is probable
and now you see the deadly urgency of this new case and why i urged young openshaw to caution
the blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance
but this one comes from london and therefore we cannot count upon delay
good god
i cried
what can it mean this relentless persecution
the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing ship
i think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them
a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner's jury
there must have been several in it and they must have been men of resource and determination
their papers they mean to have be the holder of them who it may
in this way you see k k k ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society
but of what society
have you never said sherlock holmes bending forward and sinking his voice have you never heard of the ku klux klan
i never have
holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee
here it is said he presently 'ku klux klan
a name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle
this terrible secret society was formed by some ex confederate soldiers in the southern states after the civil war and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country notably in tennessee louisiana the carolinas georgia and florida
its power was used for political purposes principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views
its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape a sprig of oak leaves in some parts melon seeds or orange pips in others
on receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways or might fly from the country
if he braved the matter out death would unfailingly come upon him and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner
so perfect was the organisation of the society and so systematic its methods that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators
for some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the united states government and of the better classes of the community in the south
eventually in the year the movement rather suddenly collapsed although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date '
you will observe said holmes laying down the volume that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of openshaw from america with their papers
it may well have been cause and effect
it is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track
you can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the south and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered
then the page we have seen is such as we might expect
it ran if i remember right 'sent the pips to a b and c' that is sent the society's warning to them
then there are successive entries that a and b cleared or left the country and finally that c was visited with i fear a sinister result for c well i think doctor that we may let some light into this dark place and i believe that the only chance young openshaw has in the meantime is to do what i have told him
there is nothing more to be said or to be done to night so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men
it had cleared in the morning and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city
sherlock holmes was already at breakfast when i came down
you will excuse me for not waiting for you said he i have i foresee a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young openshaw's
what steps will you take
i asked
it will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries
i may have to go down to horsham after all
you will not go there first
no i shall commence with the city
just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee
as i waited i lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it
it rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart
holmes i cried you are too late
ah
said he laying down his cup i feared as much
how was it done
he spoke calmly but i could see that he was deeply moved
my eye caught the name of openshaw and the heading 'tragedy near waterloo bridge '
here is the account between nine and ten last night police constable cook of the h division on duty near waterloo bridge heard a cry for help and a splash in the water
the night however was extremely dark and stormy so that in spite of the help of several passers by it was quite impossible to effect a rescue
the alarm however was given and by the aid of the water police the body was eventually recovered
it proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket was john openshaw and whose residence is near horsham
it is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from waterloo station and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing places for river steamboats
the body exhibited no traces of violence and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing stages
we sat in silence for some minutes holmes more depressed and shaken than i had ever seen him
that hurts my pride watson he said at last
it is a petty feeling no doubt but it hurts my pride
it becomes a personal matter with me now and if god sends me health i shall set my hand upon this gang
that he should come to me for help and that i should send him away to his death
he sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands
they must be cunning devils he exclaimed at last
how could they have decoyed him down there
the embankment is not on the direct line to the station
the bridge no doubt was too crowded even on such a night for their purpose
well watson we shall see who will win in the long run
i am going out now
to the police
no i shall be my own police
when i have spun the web they may take the flies but not before
all day i was engaged in my professional work and it was late in the evening before i returned to baker street
sherlock holmes had not come back yet
it was nearly ten o'clock before he entered looking pale and worn
he walked up to the sideboard and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously washing it down with a long draught of water
you are hungry i remarked
starving
it had escaped my memory
i have had nothing since breakfast
nothing
not a bite
i had no time to think of it
and how have you succeeded
well
you have a clue
i have them in the hollow of my hand
young openshaw shall not long remain unavenged
why watson let us put their own devilish trade mark upon them
it is well thought of
what do you mean
he took an orange from the cupboard and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table
of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope
on the inside of the flap he wrote s h for j
o
then he sealed it and addressed it to captain james calhoun barque 'lone star ' savannah georgia
that will await him when he enters port said he chuckling
it may give him a sleepless night
he will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as openshaw did before him
and who is this captain calhoun
the leader of the gang
i shall have the others but he first
how did you trace it then
he took a large sheet of paper from his pocket all covered with dates and names
i have spent the whole day said he over lloyd's registers and files of the old papers following the future career of every vessel which touched at pondicherry in january and february in '
there were thirty six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months
of these one the 'lone star ' instantly attracted my attention since although it was reported as having cleared from london the name is that which is given to one of the states of the union
texas i think
i was not and am not sure which but i knew that the ship must have an american origin
what then
i searched the dundee records and when i found that the barque 'lone star' was there in january ' my suspicion became a certainty
i then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of london
yes
the 'lone star' had arrived here last week
i went down to the albert dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning homeward bound to savannah
i wired to gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago and as the wind is easterly i have no doubt that she is now past the goodwins and not very far from the isle of wight
what will you do then
oh i have my hand upon him
he and the two mates are as i learn the only native born americans in the ship
the others are finns and germans
i know also that they were all three away from the ship last night
i had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo
by the time that their sailing ship reaches savannah the mail boat will have carried this letter and the cable will have informed the police of savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder
there is ever a flaw however in the best laid of human plans and the murderers of john openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another as cunning and as resolute as themselves was upon their track
very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year
we waited long for news of the lone star of savannah but none ever reached us
we did at last hear that somewhere far out in the atlantic a shattered stern post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave with the letters l
s
carved upon it and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the lone star
on glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which i have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend sherlock holmes i find many tragic some comic a large number merely strange but none commonplace for working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual and even the fantastic
of all these varied cases however i cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well known surrey family of the roylotts of stoke moran
the events in question occurred in the early days of my association with holmes when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in baker street
it is possible that i might have placed them upon record before but a promise of secrecy was made at the time from which i have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given
it is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light for i have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of dr
grimesby roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth
it was early in april in the year ' that i woke one morning to find sherlock holmes standing fully dressed by the side of my bed
he was a late riser as a rule and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter past seven i blinked up at him in some surprise and perhaps just a little resentment for i was myself regular in my habits
very sorry to knock you up watson said he but it's the common lot this morning
mrs
hudson has been knocked up she retorted upon me and i on you
what is it then a fire
no a client
it seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement who insists upon seeing me
she is waiting now in the sitting room
now when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning and knock sleepy people up out of their beds i presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate
should it prove to be an interesting case you would i am sure wish to follow it from the outset
i thought at any rate that i should call you and give you the chance
my dear fellow i would not miss it for anything
i had no keener pleasure than in following holmes in his professional investigations and in admiring the rapid deductions as swift as intuitions and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him
i rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting room
a lady dressed in black and heavily veiled who had been sitting in the window rose as we entered
good morning madam said holmes cheerily
my name is sherlock holmes
this is my intimate friend and associate dr
watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself
ha
i am glad to see that mrs
hudson has had the good sense to light the fire
pray draw up to it and i shall order you a cup of hot coffee for i observe that you are shivering
it is not cold which makes me shiver said the woman in a low voice changing her seat as requested
what then
it is fear mr
holmes
it is terror
she raised her veil as she spoke and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation her face all drawn and grey with restless frightened eyes like those of some hunted animal
her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty but her hair was shot with premature grey and her expression was weary and haggard
sherlock holmes ran her over with one of his quick all comprehensive glances
you must not fear said he soothingly bending forward and patting her forearm
we shall soon set matters right i have no doubt
you have come in by train this morning i see
you know me then
no but i observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove
you must have started early and yet you had a good drive in a dog cart along heavy roads before you reached the station
the lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion
there is no mystery my dear madam said he smiling
the left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places
the marks are perfectly fresh
there is no vehicle save a dog cart which throws up mud in that way and then only when you sit on the left hand side of the driver
whatever your reasons may be you are perfectly correct said she
i started from home before six reached leatherhead at twenty past and came in by the first train to waterloo
sir i can stand this strain no longer i shall go mad if it continues
i have no one to turn to none save only one who cares for me and he poor fellow can be of little aid
i have heard of you mr
holmes i have heard of you from mrs
farintosh whom you helped in the hour of her sore need
it was from her that i had your address
oh sir do you not think that you could help me too and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me
at present it is out of my power to reward you for your services but in a month or six weeks i shall be married with the control of my own income and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful
holmes turned to his desk and unlocking it drew out a small case book which he consulted
farintosh said he
ah yes i recall the case it was concerned with an opal tiara
i think it was before your time watson
i can only say madam that i shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as i did to that of your friend
as to reward my profession is its own reward but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses i may be put to at the time which suits you best
and now i beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter
alas
replied our visitor the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points which might seem trivial to another that even he to whom of all others i have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that i tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman
he does not say so but i can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes
but i have heard mr
holmes that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart
you may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me
i am all attention madam
my name is helen stoner and i am living with my stepfather who is the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in england the roylotts of stoke moran on the western border of surrey
holmes nodded his head
the name is familiar to me said he
the family was at one time among the richest in england and the estates extended over the borders into berkshire in the north and hampshire in the west
in the last century however four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the regency
nothing was left save a few acres of ground and the two hundred year old house which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage
the last squire dragged out his existence there living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper but his only son my stepfather seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions obtained an advance from a relative which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to calcutta where by his professional skill and his force of character he established a large practice
in a fit of anger however caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence
as it was he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to england a morose and disappointed man
when dr
roylott was in india he married my mother mrs
stoner the young widow of major general stoner of the bengal artillery
my sister julia and i were twins and we were only two years old at the time of my mother's re marriage
she had a considerable sum of money not less than pounds a year and this she bequeathed to dr
roylott entirely while we resided with him with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage
shortly after our return to england my mother died she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near crewe
dr
roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in london and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at stoke moran
the money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness
but a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time
instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours who had at first been overjoyed to see a roylott of stoke moran back in the old family seat he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path
violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family and in my stepfather's case it had i believe been intensified by his long residence in the tropics
a series of disgraceful brawls took place two of which ended in the police court until at last he became the terror of the village and the folks would fly at his approach for he is a man of immense strength and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger
last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream and it was only by paying over all the money which i could gather together that i was able to avert another public exposure
he had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble covered land which represent the family estate and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end
he has a passion also for indian animals which are sent over to him by a correspondent and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master
you can imagine from what i say that my poor sister julia and i had no great pleasure in our lives
no servant would stay with us and for a long time we did all the work of the house
she was but thirty at the time of her death and yet her hair had already begun to whiten even as mine has
your sister is dead then
she died just two years ago and it is of her death that i wish to speak to you
you can understand that living the life which i have described we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position
we had however an aunt my mother's maiden sister miss honoria westphail who lives near harrow and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's house
julia went there at christmas two years ago and met there a half pay major of marines to whom she became engaged
my stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion
sherlock holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor
pray be precise as to details said he
it is easy for me to be so for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory
the manor house is as i have already said very old and only one wing is now inhabited
the bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor the sitting rooms being in the central block of the buildings
of these bedrooms the first is dr
roylott's the second my sister's and the third my own
there is no communication between them but they all open out into the same corridor
do i make myself plain
perfectly so
the windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn
that fatal night dr
roylott had gone to his room early though we knew that he had not retired to rest for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke
she left her room therefore and came into mine where she sat for some time chatting about her approaching wedding
at eleven o'clock she rose to leave me but she paused at the door and looked back
'tell me helen ' said she 'have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night '
'never ' said i
'i suppose that you could not possibly whistle yourself in your sleep '
'certainly not
but why '
'because during the last few nights i have always about three in the morning heard a low clear whistle
i am a light sleeper and it has awakened me
i cannot tell where it came from perhaps from the next room perhaps from the lawn
i thought that i would just ask you whether you had heard it '
'no i have not
it must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation '
'very likely
and yet if it were on the lawn i wonder that you did not hear it also '
'ah but i sleep more heavily than you '
'well it is of no great consequence at any rate '
she smiled back at me closed my door and a few moments later i heard her key turn in the lock
indeed said holmes
was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night
always
and why
i think that i mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon
we had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked
quite so
pray proceed with your statement
i could not sleep that night
a vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me
my sister and i you will recollect were twins and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied
it was a wild night
the wind was howling outside and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows
suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman
i knew that it was my sister's voice
i sprang from my bed wrapped a shawl round me and rushed into the corridor
as i opened my door i seemed to hear a low whistle such as my sister described and a few moments later a clanging sound as if a mass of metal had fallen
as i ran down the passage my sister's door was unlocked and revolved slowly upon its hinges
i stared at it horror stricken not knowing what was about to issue from it
by the light of the corridor lamp i saw my sister appear at the opening her face blanched with terror her hands groping for help her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard
i ran to her and threw my arms round her but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground
she writhed as one who is in terrible pain and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed
at first i thought that she had not recognised me but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget 'oh my god
helen
it was the band
the speckled band '
there was something else which she would fain have said and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor's room but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words
i rushed out calling loudly for my stepfather and i met him hastening from his room in his dressing gown
when he reached my sister's side she was unconscious and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village all efforts were in vain for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness
such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister
one moment said holmes are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound
could you swear to it
that was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry
it is my strong impression that i heard it and yet among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house i may possibly have been deceived
was your sister dressed
no she was in her night dress
in her right hand was found the charred stump of a match and in her left a match box
showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place
that is important
and what conclusions did the coroner come to
he investigated the case with great care for dr
roylott's conduct had long been notorious in the county but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death
my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side and the windows were blocked by old fashioned shutters with broad iron bars which were secured every night
the walls were carefully sounded and were shown to be quite solid all round and the flooring was also thoroughly examined with the same result
the chimney is wide but is barred up by four large staples
it is certain therefore that my sister was quite alone when she met her end
besides there were no marks of any violence upon her
how about poison
the doctors examined her for it but without success
what do you think that this unfortunate lady died of then
it is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock though what it was that frightened her i cannot imagine
were there gipsies in the plantation at the time
yes there are nearly always some there
ah and what did you gather from this allusion to a band a speckled band
sometimes i have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation
i do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used
holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied
these are very deep waters said he pray go on with your narrative
two years have passed since then and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever
a month ago however a dear friend whom i have known for many years has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage
his name is armitage percy armitage the second son of mr
armitage of crane water near reading
my stepfather has offered no opposition to the match and we are to be married in the course of the spring
two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building and my bedroom wall has been pierced so that i have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept
imagine then my thrill of terror when last night as i lay awake thinking over her terrible fate i suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death
i sprang up and lit the lamp but nothing was to be seen in the room
i was too shaken to go to bed again however so i dressed and as soon as it was daylight i slipped down got a dog cart at the crown inn which is opposite and drove to leatherhead from whence i have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice
you have done wisely said my friend
but have you told me all
yes all
miss roylott you have not
you are screening your stepfather
why what do you mean
for answer holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee
five little livid spots the marks of four fingers and a thumb were printed upon the white wrist
you have been cruelly used said holmes
the lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist
he is a hard man she said and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength
there was a long silence during which holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire
this is a very deep business he said at last
there are a thousand details which i should desire to know before i decide upon our course of action
yet we have not a moment to lose
if we were to come to stoke moran to day would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather
as it happens he spoke of coming into town to day upon some most important business
it is probable that he will be away all day and that there would be nothing to disturb you
we have a housekeeper now but she is old and foolish and i could easily get her out of the way
excellent
you are not averse to this trip watson
by no means
then we shall both come
what are you going to do yourself
i have one or two things which i would wish to do now that i am in town
but i shall return by the twelve o'clock train so as to be there in time for your coming
and you may expect us early in the afternoon
i have myself some small business matters to attend to
will you not wait and breakfast
no i must go
my heart is lightened already since i have confided my trouble to you
i shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon
she dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room
and what do you think of it all watson
asked sherlock holmes leaning back in his chair
it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business
dark enough and sinister enough
yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound and that the door window and chimney are impassable then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end
what becomes then of these nocturnal whistles and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman
i cannot think
when you combine the ideas of whistles at night the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage the dying allusion to a band and finally the fact that miss helen stoner heard a metallic clang which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place i think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines
but what then did the gipsies do
i cannot imagine
i see many objections to any such theory
and so do i it is precisely for that reason that we are going to stoke moran this day
i want to see whether the objections are fatal or if they may be explained away
but what in the name of the devil
the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture
his costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural having a black top hat a long frock coat and a pair of high gaiters with a hunting crop swinging in his hand
so tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side
a large face seared with a thousand wrinkles burned yellow with the sun and marked with every evil passion was turned from one to the other of us while his deep set bile shot eyes and his high thin fleshless nose gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey
which of you is holmes
asked this apparition
my name sir but you have the advantage of me said my companion quietly
i am dr
grimesby roylott of stoke moran
indeed doctor said holmes blandly
pray take a seat
i will do nothing of the kind
my stepdaughter has been here
i have traced her
what has she been saying to you
it is a little cold for the time of the year said holmes
what has she been saying to you
screamed the old man furiously
but i have heard that the crocuses promise well continued my companion imperturbably
ha
you put me off do you
said our new visitor taking a step forward and shaking his hunting crop
i know you you scoundrel
i have heard of you before
you are holmes the meddler
my friend smiled
holmes the busybody
his smile broadened
holmes the scotland yard jack in office
holmes chuckled heartily
your conversation is most entertaining said he
when you go out close the door for there is a decided draught
i will go when i have said my say
don't you dare to meddle with my affairs
i know that miss stoner has been here
i traced her
i am a dangerous man to fall foul of
see here
he stepped swiftly forward seized the poker and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands
see that you keep yourself out of my grip he snarled and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room
he seems a very amiable person said holmes laughing
i am not quite so bulky but if he had remained i might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own
as he spoke he picked up the steel poker and with a sudden effort straightened it out again
fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force
this incident gives zest to our investigation however and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her
and now watson we shall order breakfast and afterwards i shall walk down to doctors' commons where i hope to get some data which may help us in this matter
it was nearly one o'clock when sherlock holmes returned from his excursion
he held in his hand a sheet of blue paper scrawled over with notes and figures
i have seen the will of the deceased wife said he
to determine its exact meaning i have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned
the total income which at the time of the wife's death was little short of pounds is now through the fall in agricultural prices not more than pounds
each daughter can claim an income of pounds in case of marriage
it is evident therefore that if both girls had married this beauty would have had a mere pittance while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent
my morning's work has not been wasted since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort
and now watson this is too serious for dawdling especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs so if you are ready we shall call a cab and drive to waterloo
i should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket
an eley's no
is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots
that and a tooth brush are i think all that we need
at waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for leatherhead where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes
it was a perfect day with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens
the trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth
to me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged
my companion sat in the front of the trap his arms folded his hat pulled down over his eyes and his chin sunk upon his breast buried in the deepest thought
suddenly however he started tapped me on the shoulder and pointed over the meadows
look there
said he
a heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope thickening into a grove at the highest point
from amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof tree of a very old mansion
stoke moran
said he
yes sir that be the house of dr
grimesby roylott remarked the driver
there is some building going on there said holmes that is where we are going
there's the village said the driver pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left but if you want to get to the house you'll find it shorter to get over this stile and so by the foot path over the fields
there it is where the lady is walking
and the lady i fancy is miss stoner observed holmes shading his eyes
yes i think we had better do as you suggest
we got off paid our fare and the trap rattled back on its way to leatherhead
i thought it as well said holmes as we climbed the stile that this fellow should think we had come here as architects or on some definite business
it may stop his gossip
good afternoon miss stoner
you see that we have been as good as our word
our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy
i have been waiting so eagerly for you she cried shaking hands with us warmly
all has turned out splendidly
dr
roylott has gone to town and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening
we have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance said holmes and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred
miss stoner turned white to the lips as she listened
good heavens
she cried he has followed me then
so it appears
he is so cunning that i never know when i am safe from him
what will he say when he returns
he must guard himself for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track
you must lock yourself up from him to night
if he is violent we shall take you away to your aunt's at harrow
now we must make the best use of our time so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine
the building was of grey lichen blotched stone with a high central portion and two curving wings like the claws of a crab thrown out on each side
in one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards while the roof was partly caved in a picture of ruin
the central portion was in little better repair but the right hand block was comparatively modern and the blinds in the windows with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys showed that this was where the family resided
some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall and the stone work had been broken into but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit
holmes walked slowly up and down the ill trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows
this i take it belongs to the room in which you used to sleep the centre one to your sister's and the one next to the main building to dr
roylott's chamber
exactly so
but i am now sleeping in the middle one
pending the alterations as i understand
by the way there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall
there were none
i believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room
ah
that is suggestive
now on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open
there are windows in it of course
yes but very small ones
too narrow for anyone to pass through
as you both locked your doors at night your rooms were unapproachable from that side
now would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters
miss stoner did so and holmes after a careful examination through the open window endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open but without success
there was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar
then with his lens he tested the hinges but they were of solid iron built firmly into the massive masonry
hum
said he scratching his chin in some perplexity my theory certainly presents some difficulties
no one could pass these shutters if they were bolted
well we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter
a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened
holmes refused to examine the third chamber so we passed at once to the second that in which miss stoner was now sleeping and in which her sister had met with her fate
it was a homely little room with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace after the fashion of old country houses
a brown chest of drawers stood in one corner a narrow white counterpaned bed in another and a dressing table on the left hand side of the window
these articles with two small wicker work chairs made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre
the boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown worm eaten oak so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house
holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down taking in every detail of the apartment
where does that bell communicate with
he asked at last pointing to a thick bell rope which hung down beside the bed the tassel actually lying upon the pillow
it goes to the housekeeper's room
it looks newer than the other things
yes it was only put there a couple of years ago
your sister asked for it i suppose
no i never heard of her using it
we used always to get what we wanted for ourselves
indeed it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell pull there
you will excuse me for a few minutes while i satisfy myself as to this floor
he threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward examining minutely the cracks between the boards
then he did the same with the wood work with which the chamber was panelled
finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall
finally he took the bell rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug
why it's a dummy said he
won't it ring
no it is not even attached to a wire
this is very interesting
you can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is
how very absurd
i never noticed that before
very strange
muttered holmes pulling at the rope
there are one or two very singular points about this room
for example what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room when with the same trouble he might have communicated with the outside air
that is also quite modern said the lady
done about the same time as the bell rope
remarked holmes
yes there were several little changes carried out about that time
they seem to have been of a most interesting character dummy bell ropes and ventilators which do not ventilate
with your permission miss stoner we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment
dr
grimesby roylott's chamber was larger than that of his step daughter but was as plainly furnished
a camp bed a small wooden shelf full of books mostly of a technical character an armchair beside the bed a plain wooden chair against the wall a round table and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye
holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest
what's in here
he asked tapping the safe
my stepfather's business papers
oh
you have seen inside then
only once some years ago
i remember that it was full of papers
there isn't a cat in it for example
no
what a strange idea
well look at this
he took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it
no we don't keep a cat
but there is a cheetah and a baboon
ah yes of course
well a cheetah is just a big cat and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants i daresay
there is one point which i should wish to determine
he squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention
thank you
that is quite settled said he rising and putting his lens in his pocket
hullo
here is something interesting
the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed
the lash however was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord
what do you make of that watson
it's a common enough lash
but i don't know why it should be tied
that is not quite so common is it
ah me
it's a wicked world and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all
i think that i have seen enough now miss stoner and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn
i had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation
we had walked several times up and down the lawn neither miss stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie
it is very essential miss stoner said he that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect
i shall most certainly do so
the matter is too serious for any hesitation
your life may depend upon your compliance
i assure you that i am in your hands
in the first place both my friend and i must spend the night in your room
both miss stoner and i gazed at him in astonishment
yes it must be so
let me explain
i believe that that is the village inn over there
yes that is the crown
very good
your windows would be visible from there
certainly
you must confine yourself to your room on pretence of a headache when your stepfather comes back
then when you hear him retire for the night you must open the shutters of your window undo the hasp put your lamp there as a signal to us and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy
i have no doubt that in spite of the repairs you could manage there for one night
oh yes easily
the rest you will leave in our hands
but what will you do
we shall spend the night in your room and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you
i believe mr
holmes that you have already made up your mind said miss stoner laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve
perhaps i have
then for pity's sake tell me what was the cause of my sister's death
i should prefer to have clearer proofs before i speak
you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct and if she died from some sudden fright
no i do not think so
i think that there was probably some more tangible cause
and now miss stoner we must leave you for if dr
roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain
good bye and be brave for if you will do what i have told you you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you
sherlock holmes and i had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting room at the crown inn
they were on the upper floor and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate and of the inhabited wing of stoke moran manor house
at dusk we saw dr
grimesby roylott drive past his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him
the boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him
the trap drove on and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting rooms
do you know watson said holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness i have really some scruples as to taking you to night
there is a distinct element of danger
can i be of assistance
your presence might be invaluable
then i shall certainly come
it is very kind of you
you speak of danger
you have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me
no but i fancy that i may have deduced a little more
i imagine that you saw all that i did
i saw nothing remarkable save the bell rope and what purpose that could answer i confess is more than i can imagine
you saw the ventilator too
yes but i do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms
it was so small that a rat could hardly pass through
i knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to stoke moran
my dear holmes
oh yes i did
you remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell dr
roylott's cigar
now of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms
it could only be a small one or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry
i deduced a ventilator
but what harm can there be in that
well there is at least a curious coincidence of dates
a ventilator is made a cord is hung and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies
does not that strike you
i cannot as yet see any connection
did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed
no
it was clamped to the floor
did you ever see a bed fastened like that before
i cannot say that i have
the lady could not move her bed
it must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope or so we may call it since it was clearly never meant for a bell pull
holmes i cried i seem to see dimly what you are hinting at
we are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime
subtle enough and horrible enough
when a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals
he has nerve and he has knowledge
palmer and pritchard were among the heads of their profession
this man strikes even deeper but i think watson that we shall be able to strike deeper still
but we shall have horrors enough before the night is over for goodness' sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful
about nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished and all was dark in the direction of the manor house
two hours passed slowly away and then suddenly just at the stroke of eleven a single bright light shone out right in front of us
that is our signal said holmes springing to his feet it comes from the middle window
as we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance and that it was possible that we might spend the night there
a moment later we were out on the dark road a chill wind blowing in our faces and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand
there was little difficulty in entering the grounds for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall
making our way among the trees we reached the lawn crossed it and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness
my god
i whispered did you see it
holmes was for the moment as startled as i his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation
then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear
it is a nice household he murmured
that is the baboon
i had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected
there was a cheetah too perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment
i confess that i felt easier in my mind when after following holmes' example and slipping off my shoes i found myself inside the bedroom
my companion noiselessly closed the shutters moved the lamp onto the table and cast his eyes round the room
all was as we had seen it in the daytime
then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that i could do to distinguish the words the least sound would be fatal to our plans
i nodded to show that i had heard
we must sit without light
he would see it through the ventilator
i nodded again
do not go asleep your very life may depend upon it
have your pistol ready in case we should need it
i will sit on the side of the bed and you in that chair
i took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table
holmes had brought up a long thin cane and this he placed upon the bed beside him
by it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle
then he turned down the lamp and we were left in darkness
how shall i ever forget that dreadful vigil
i could not hear a sound not even the drawing of a breath and yet i knew that my companion sat open eyed within a few feet of me in the same state of nervous tension in which i was myself
the shutters cut off the least ray of light and we waited in absolute darkness
from outside came the occasional cry of a night bird and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty
far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock which boomed out every quarter of an hour
how long they seemed those quarters
twelve struck and one and two and three and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall
suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator which vanished immediately but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal
someone in the next room had lit a dark lantern
i heard a gentle sound of movement and then all was silent once more though the smell grew stronger
for half an hour i sat with straining ears
then suddenly another sound became audible a very gentle soothing sound like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle
the instant that we heard it holmes sprang from the bed struck a match and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell pull
you see it watson
he yelled
you see it
but i saw nothing
at the moment when holmes struck the light i heard a low clear whistle but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely
i could however see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing
he had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened
it swelled up louder and louder a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek
they say that away down in the village and even in the distant parsonage that cry raised the sleepers from their beds
it struck cold to our hearts and i stood gazing at holmes and he at me until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose
what can it mean
i gasped
it means that it is all over holmes answered
and perhaps after all it is for the best
take your pistol and we will enter dr
roylott's room
with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor
twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within
then he turned the handle and entered i at his heels with the cocked pistol in my hand
it was a singular sight which met our eyes
on the table stood a dark lantern with the shutter half open throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe the door of which was ajar
beside this table on the wooden chair sat dr
grimesby roylott clad in a long grey dressing gown his bare ankles protruding beneath and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers
across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day
his chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling
round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band with brownish speckles which seemed to be bound tightly round his head
as we entered he made neither sound nor motion
the band
the speckled band
whispered holmes
i took a step forward
in an instant his strange headgear began to move and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent
it is a swamp adder
cried holmes the deadliest snake in india
he has died within ten seconds of being bitten
violence does in truth recoil upon the violent and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another
let us thrust this creature back into its den and we can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened
as he spoke he drew the dog whip swiftly from the dead man's lap and throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it from its horrid perch and carrying it at arm's length threw it into the iron safe which he closed upon it
such are the true facts of the death of dr
grimesby roylott of stoke moran
it is not necessary that i should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at harrow of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet
the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back next day
i had said he come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows my dear watson how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data
the presence of the gipsies and the use of the word 'band ' which was used by the poor girl no doubt to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent
i can only claim the merit that i instantly reconsidered my position when however it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door
my attention was speedily drawn as i have already remarked to you to this ventilator and to the bell rope which hung down to the bed
the discovery that this was a dummy and that the bed was clamped to the floor instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed
the idea of a snake instantly occurred to me and when i coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from india i felt that i was probably on the right track
the idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an eastern training
the rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also from his point of view be an advantage
it would be a sharp eyed coroner indeed who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work
then i thought of the whistle
of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim
he had trained it probably by the use of the milk which we saw to return to him when summoned
he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed
it might or might not bite the occupant perhaps she might escape every night for a week but sooner or later she must fall a victim
i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his room
an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator
the sight of the safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained
the metallic clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant
having once made up my mind you know the steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof
i heard the creature hiss as i have no doubt that you did also and i instantly lit the light and attacked it
with the result of driving it through the ventilator
and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side
some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper so that it flew upon the first person it saw
in this way i am no doubt indirectly responsible for dr
grimesby roylott's death and i cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience
in choosing a few typical cases which illustrate the remarkable mental qualities of my friend sherlock holmes i have endeavoured as far as possible to select those which presented the minimum of sensationalism while offering a fair field for his talents
it is however unfortunately impossible entirely to separate the sensational from the criminal and a chronicler is left in the dilemma that he must either sacrifice details which are essential to his statement and so give a false impression of the problem or he must use matter which chance and not choice has provided him with
with this short preface i shall turn to my notes of what proved to be a strange though a peculiarly terrible chain of events
it was a blazing hot day in august
baker street was like an oven and the glare of the sunlight upon the yellow brickwork of the house across the road was painful to the eye
it was hard to believe that these were the same walls which loomed so gloomily through the fogs of winter
our blinds were half drawn and holmes lay curled upon the sofa reading and re reading a letter which he had received by the morning post
for myself my term of service in india had trained me to stand heat better than cold and a thermometer at ninety was no hardship
but the morning paper was uninteresting
parliament had risen
everybody was out of town and i yearned for the glades of the new forest or the shingle of southsea
a depleted bank account had caused me to postpone my holiday and as to my companion neither the country nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him
he loved to lie in the very centre of five millions of people with his filaments stretching out and running through them responsive to every little rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime
appreciation of nature found no place among his many gifts and his only change was when he turned his mind from the evil doer of the town to track down his brother of the country
finding that holmes was too absorbed for conversation i had tossed aside the barren paper and leaning back in my chair i fell into a brown study
suddenly my companion's voice broke in upon my thoughts you are right watson said he
it does seem a most preposterous way of settling a dispute most preposterous i exclaimed and then suddenly realizing how he had echoed the inmost thought of my soul i sat up in my chair and stared at him in blank amazement
what is this holmes i cried
this is beyond anything which i could have imagined he laughed heartily at my perplexity
you remember he said that some little time ago when i read you the passage in one of poe's sketches in which a close reasoner follows the unspoken thoughts of his companion you were inclined to treat the matter as a mere _tour de force_ of the author
on my remarking that i was constantly in the habit of doing the same thing you expressed incredulity oh no perhaps not with your tongue my dear watson but certainly with your eyebrows
so when i saw you throw down your paper and enter upon a train of thought i was very happy to have the opportunity of reading it off and eventually of breaking into it as a proof that i had been in rapport with you but i was still far from satisfied
in the example which you read to me said i the reasoner drew his conclusions from the actions of the man whom he observed
if i remember right he stumbled over a heap of stones looked up at the stars and so on
but i have been seated quietly in my chair and what clues can i have given you you do yourself an injustice
the features are given to man as the means by which he shall express his emotions and yours are faithful servants do you mean to say that you read my train of thoughts from my features your features and especially your eyes
perhaps you cannot yourself recall how your reverie commenced no i cannot then i will tell you
after throwing down your paper which was the action which drew my attention to you you sat for half a minute with a vacant expression
then your eyes fixed themselves upon your newly framed picture of general gordon and i saw by the alteration in your face that a train of thought had been started
but it did not lead very far
your eyes flashed across to the unframed portrait of henry ward beecher which stands upon the top of your books
then you glanced up at the wall and of course your meaning was obvious
you were thinking that if the portrait were framed it would just cover that bare space and correspond with gordon's picture over there you have followed me wonderfully i exclaimed
so far i could hardly have gone astray
but now your thoughts went back to beecher and you looked hard across as if you were studying the character in his features
then your eyes ceased to pucker but you continued to look across and your face was thoughtful
you were recalling the incidents of beecher's career
i was well aware that you could not do this without thinking of the mission which he undertook on behalf of the north at the time of the civil war for i remember your expressing your passionate indignation at the way in which he was received by the more turbulent of our people
you felt so strongly about it that i knew you could not think of beecher without thinking of that also
when a moment later i saw your eyes wander away from the picture i suspected that your mind had now turned to the civil war and when i observed that your lips set your eyes sparkled and your hands clenched i was positive that you were indeed thinking of the gallantry which was shown by both sides in that desperate struggle
but then again your face grew sadder you shook your head
you were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and useless waste of life
your hand stole towards your own old wound and a smile quivered on your lips which showed me that the ridiculous side of this method of settling international questions had forced itself upon your mind
at this point i agreed with you that it was preposterous and was glad to find that all my deductions had been correct absolutely said i
and now that you have explained it i confess that i am as amazed as before it was very superficial my dear watson i assure you
i should not have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some incredulity the other day
but i have in my hands here a little problem which may prove to be more difficult of solution than my small essay in thought reading
have you observed in the paper a short paragraph referring to the remarkable contents of a packet sent through the post to miss cushing of cross street croydon no i saw nothing ah
then you must have overlooked it
just toss it over to me
here it is under the financial column
perhaps you would be good enough to read it aloud i picked up the paper which he had thrown back to me and read the paragraph indicated
it was headed a gruesome packet miss susan cushing living at cross street croydon has been made the victim of what must be regarded as a peculiarly revolting practical joke unless some more sinister meaning should prove to be attached to the incident
at two o'clock yesterday afternoon a small packet wrapped in brown paper was handed in by the postman
a cardboard box was inside which was filled with coarse salt
on emptying this miss cushing was horrified to find two human ears apparently quite freshly severed
the box had been sent by parcel post from belfast upon the morning before
there is no indication as to the sender and the matter is the more mysterious as miss cushing who is a maiden lady of fifty has led a most retired life and has so few acquaintances or correspondents that it is a rare event for her to receive anything through the post
some years ago however when she resided at penge she let apartments in her house to three young medical students whom she was obliged to get rid of on account of their noisy and irregular habits
the police are of opinion that this outrage may have been perpetrated upon miss cushing by these youths who owed her a grudge and who hoped to frighten her by sending her these relics of the dissecting rooms
some probability is lent to the theory by the fact that one of these students came from the north of ireland and to the best of miss cushing's belief from belfast
in the meantime the matter is being actively investigated mr
lestrade one of the very smartest of our detective officers being in charge of the case so much for the _daily chronicle_ said holmes as i finished reading
now for our friend lestrade
i had a note from him this morning in which he says 'i think that this case is very much in your line
we have every hope of clearing the matter up but we find a little difficulty in getting anything to work upon
we have of course wired to the belfast post office but a large number of parcels were handed in upon that day and they have no means of identifying this particular one or of remembering the sender
the box is a half pound box of honeydew tobacco and does not help us in any way
the medical student theory still appears to me to be the most feasible but if you should have a few hours to spare i should be very happy to see you out here
i shall be either at the house or in the police station all day ' what say you watson
can you rise superior to the heat and run down to croydon with me on the off chance of a case for your annals i was longing for something to do you shall have it then
ring for our boots and tell them to order a cab
i'll be back in a moment when i have changed my dressing gown and filled my cigar case a shower of rain fell while we were in the train and the heat was far less oppressive in croydon than in town
holmes had sent on a wire so that lestrade as wiry as dapper and as ferret like as ever was waiting for us at the station
a walk of five minutes took us to cross street where miss cushing resided
it was a very long street of two story brick houses neat and prim with whitened stone steps and little groups of aproned women gossiping at the doors
halfway down lestrade stopped and tapped at a door which was opened by a small servant girl
miss cushing was sitting in the front room into which we were ushered
she was a placid faced woman with large gentle eyes and grizzled hair curving down over her temples on each side
a worked antimacassar lay upon her lap and a basket of coloured silks stood upon a stool beside her
they are in the outhouse those dreadful things said she as lestrade entered
i wish that you would take them away altogether so i shall miss cushing
i only kept them here until my friend mr
holmes should have seen them in your presence why in my presence sir in case he wished to ask any questions what is the use of asking me questions when i tell you i know nothing whatever about it quite so madam said holmes in his soothing way
i have no doubt that you have been annoyed more than enough already over this business indeed i have sir
i am a quiet woman and live a retired life
it is something new for me to see my name in the papers and to find the police in my house
i won't have those things in here mr
lestrade
if you wish to see them you must go to the outhouse it was a small shed in the narrow garden which ran behind the house
lestrade went in and brought out a yellow cardboard box with a piece of brown paper and some string
there was a bench at the end of the path and we all sat down while holmes examined one by one the articles which lestrade had handed to him
the string is exceedingly interesting he remarked holding it up to the light and sniffing at it
what do you make of this string lestrade it has been tarred precisely
it is a piece of tarred twine
you have also no doubt remarked that miss cushing has cut the cord with a scissors as can be seen by the double fray on each side
this is of importance i cannot see the importance said lestrade
the importance lies in the fact that the knot is left intact and that this knot is of a peculiar character it is very neatly tied
i had already made a note to that effect said lestrade complacently
so much for the string then said holmes smiling now for the box wrapper
brown paper with a distinct smell of coffee
what did you not observe it
i think there can be no doubt of it
address printed in rather straggling characters 'miss s cushing cross street croydon ' done with a broad pointed pen probably a j and with very inferior ink
the word 'croydon' has been originally spelled with an 'i ' which has been changed to 'y ' the parcel was directed then by a man the printing is distinctly masculine of limited education and unacquainted with the town of croydon
so far so good
the box is a yellow half pound honeydew box with nothing distinctive save two thumb marks at the left bottom corner
it is filled with rough salt of the quality used for preserving hides and other of the coarser commercial purposes
and embedded in it are these very singular enclosures he took out the two ears as he spoke and laying a board across his knee he examined them minutely while lestrade and i bending forward on each side of him glanced alternately at these dreadful relics and at the thoughtful eager face of our companion
finally he returned them to the box once more and sat for a while in deep meditation
you have observed of course said he at last that the ears are not a pair yes i have noticed that
but if this were the practical joke of some students from the dissecting rooms it would be as easy for them to send two odd ears as a pair precisely
but this is not a practical joke you are sure of it the presumption is strongly against it
bodies in the dissecting rooms are injected with preservative fluid
these ears bear no signs of this
they are fresh too
they have been cut off with a blunt instrument which would hardly happen if a student had done it
again carbolic or rectified spirits would be the preservatives which would suggest themselves to the medical mind certainly not rough salt
i repeat that there is no practical joke here but that we are investigating a serious crime a vague thrill ran through me as i listened to my companion's words and saw the stern gravity which had hardened his features
this brutal preliminary seemed to shadow forth some strange and inexplicable horror in the background
lestrade however shook his head like a man who is only half convinced
there are objections to the joke theory no doubt said he but there are much stronger reasons against the other
we know that this woman has led a most quiet and respectable life at penge and here for the last twenty years
she has hardly been away from her home for a day during that time
why on earth then should any criminal send her the proofs of his guilt especially as unless she is a most consummate actress she understands quite as little of the matter as we do that is the problem which we have to solve holmes answered and for my part i shall set about it by presuming that my reasoning is correct and that a double murder has been committed
one of these ears is a woman's small finely formed and pierced for an earring
the other is a man's sun burned discoloured and also pierced for an earring
these two people are presumably dead or we should have heard their story before now
to day is friday
the packet was posted on thursday morning
the tragedy then occurred on wednesday or tuesday or earlier
if the two people were murdered who but their murderer would have sent this sign of his work to miss cushing
we may take it that the sender of the packet is the man whom we want
but he must have some strong reason for sending miss cushing this packet
what reason then
it must have been to tell her that the deed was done
or to pain her perhaps
but in that case she knows who it is
does she know
i doubt it
if she knew why should she call the police in
she might have buried the ears and no one would have been the wiser
that is what she would have done if she had wished to shield the criminal
but if she does not wish to shield him she would give his name
there is a tangle here which needs straightening out he had been talking in a high quick voice staring blankly up over the garden fence but now he sprang briskly to his feet and walked towards the house
i have a few questions to ask miss cushing said he
in that case i may leave you here said lestrade for i have another small business on hand
i think that i have nothing further to learn from miss cushing
you will find me at the police station we shall look in on our way to the train answered holmes
a moment later he and i were back in the front room where the impassive lady was still quietly working away at her antimacassar
she put it down on her lap as we entered and looked at us with her frank searching blue eyes
i am convinced sir she said that this matter is a mistake and that the parcel was never meant for me at all
i have said this several times to the gentleman from scotland yard but he simply laughs at me
i have not an enemy in the world as far as i know so why should anyone play me such a trick i am coming to be of the same opinion miss cushing said holmes taking a seat beside her
i think that it is more than probable he paused and i was surprised on glancing round to see that he was staring with singular intentness at the lady's profile
surprise and satisfaction were both for an instant to be read upon his eager face though when she glanced round to find out the cause of his silence he had become as demure as ever
i stared hard myself at her flat grizzled hair her trim cap her little gilt earrings her placid features but i could see nothing which could account for my companion's evident excitement
there were one or two questions oh i am weary of questions cried miss cushing impatiently
you have two sisters i believe how could you know that i observed the very instant that i entered the room that you have a portrait group of three ladies upon the mantelpiece one of whom is undoubtedly yourself while the others are so exceedingly like you that there could be no doubt of the relationship yes you are quite right
those are my sisters sarah and mary and here at my elbow is another portrait taken at liverpool of your younger sister in the company of a man who appears to be a steward by his uniform
i observe that she was unmarried at the time you are very quick at observing that is my trade well you are quite right
but she was married to mr
browner a few days afterwards
he was on the south american line when that was taken but he was so fond of her that he couldn't abide to leave her for so long and he got into the liverpool and london boats ah the _conqueror_ perhaps no the _may day_ when last i heard
jim came down here to see me once
that was before he broke the pledge but afterwards he would always take drink when he was ashore and a little drink would send him stark staring mad
ah
it was a bad day that ever he took a glass in his hand again
first he dropped me then he quarrelled with sarah and now that mary has stopped writing we don't know how things are going with them it was evident that miss cushing had come upon a subject on which she felt very deeply
like most people who lead a lonely life she was shy at first but ended by becoming extremely communicative
she told us many details about her brother in law the steward and then wandering off on the subject of her former lodgers the medical students she gave us a long account of their delinquencies with their names and those of their hospitals
holmes listened attentively to everything throwing in a question from time to time
about your second sister sarah said he
i wonder since you are both maiden ladies that you do not keep house together ah
you don't know sarah's temper or you would wonder no more
i tried it when i came to croydon and we kept on until about two months ago when we had to part
i don't want to say a word against my own sister but she was always meddlesome and hard to please was sarah you say that she quarrelled with your liverpool relations yes and they were the best of friends at one time
why she went up there to live in order to be near them
and now she has no word hard enough for jim browner
the last six months that she was here she would speak of nothing but his drinking and his ways
he had caught her meddling i suspect and given her a bit of his mind and that was the start of it thank you miss cushing said holmes rising and bowing
your sister sarah lives i think you said at new street wallington
good bye and i am very sorry that you should have been troubled over a case with which as you say you have nothing whatever to do there was a cab passing as we came out and holmes hailed it
how far to wallington he asked
only about a mile sir very good
jump in watson
we must strike while the iron is hot
simple as the case is there have been one or two very instructive details in connection with it
just pull up at a telegraph office as you pass cabby holmes sent off a short wire and for the rest of the drive lay back in the cab with his hat tilted over his nose to keep the sun from his face
our driver pulled up at a house which was not unlike the one which we had just quitted
my companion ordered him to wait and had his hand upon the knocker when the door opened and a grave young gentleman in black with a very shiny hat appeared on the step
is miss cushing at home asked holmes
miss sarah cushing is extremely ill said he
she has been suffering since yesterday from brain symptoms of great severity
as her medical adviser i cannot possibly take the responsibility of allowing anyone to see her
i should recommend you to call again in ten days he drew on his gloves closed the door and marched off down the street
well if we can't we can't said holmes cheerfully
perhaps she could not or would not have told you much i did not wish her to tell me anything
i only wanted to look at her
however i think that i have got all that i want
drive us to some decent hotel cabby where we may have some lunch and afterwards we shall drop down upon friend lestrade at the police station we had a pleasant little meal together during which holmes would talk about nothing but violins narrating with great exultation how he had purchased his own stradivarius which was worth at least five hundred guineas at a jew broker's in tottenham court road for fifty five shillings
this led him to paganini and we sat for an hour over a bottle of claret while he told me anecdote after anecdote of that extraordinary man
the afternoon was far advanced and the hot glare had softened into a mellow glow before we found ourselves at the police station
lestrade was waiting for us at the door
a telegram for you mr
holmes said he
ha
it is the answer he tore it open glanced his eyes over it and crumpled it into his pocket
that's all right said he
have you found out anything i have found out everything what lestrade stared at him in amazement
you are joking i was never more serious in my life
a shocking crime has been committed and i think i have now laid bare every detail of it and the criminal holmes scribbled a few words upon the back of one of his visiting cards and threw it over to lestrade
that is the name he said
you cannot effect an arrest until to morrow night at the earliest
i should prefer that you do not mention my name at all in connection with the case as i choose to be only associated with those crimes which present some difficulty in their solution
come on watson we strode off together to the station leaving lestrade still staring with a delighted face at the card which holmes had thrown him
the case said sherlock holmes as we chatted over our cigars that night in our rooms at baker street is one where as in the investigations which you have chronicled under the names of 'a study in scarlet' and of 'the sign of four ' we have been compelled to reason backward from effects to causes
i have written to lestrade asking him to supply us with the details which are now wanting and which he will only get after he has secured his man
that he may be safely trusted to do for although he is absolutely devoid of reason he is as tenacious as a bulldog when he once understands what he has to do and indeed it is just this tenacity which has brought him to the top at scotland yard your case is not complete then i asked
it is fairly complete in essentials
we know who the author of the revolting business is although one of the victims still escapes us
of course you have formed your own conclusions i presume that this jim browner the steward of a liverpool boat is the man whom you suspect oh
it is more than a suspicion and yet i cannot see anything save very vague indications on the contrary to my mind nothing could be more clear
let me run over the principal steps
we approached the case you remember with an absolutely blank mind which is always an advantage
we had formed no theories
we were simply there to observe and to draw inferences from our observations
what did we see first
a very placid and respectable lady who seemed quite innocent of any secret and a portrait which showed me that she had two younger sisters
it instantly flashed across my mind that the box might have been meant for one of these
i set the idea aside as one which could be disproved or confirmed at our leisure
then we went to the garden as you remember and we saw the very singular contents of the little yellow box
the string was of the quality which is used by sailmakers aboard ship and at once a whiff of the sea was perceptible in our investigation
when i observed that the knot was one which is popular with sailors that the parcel had been posted at a port and that the male ear was pierced for an earring which is so much more common among sailors than landsmen i was quite certain that all the actors in the tragedy were to be found among our seafaring classes
when i came to examine the address of the packet i observed that it was to miss s cushing
now the oldest sister would of course be miss cushing and although her initial was 's' it might belong to one of the others as well
in that case we should have to commence our investigation from a fresh basis altogether
i therefore went into the house with the intention of clearing up this point
i was about to assure miss cushing that i was convinced that a mistake had been made when you may remember that i came suddenly to a stop
the fact was that i had just seen something which filled me with surprise and at the same time narrowed the field of our inquiry immensely
as a medical man you are aware watson that there is no part of the body which varies so much as the human ear
each ear is as a rule quite distinctive and differs from all other ones
in last year's _anthropological journal_ you will find two short monographs from my pen upon the subject
i had therefore examined the ears in the box with the eyes of an expert and had carefully noted their anatomical peculiarities
imagine my surprise then when on looking at miss cushing i perceived that her ear corresponded exactly with the female ear which i had just inspected
the matter was entirely beyond coincidence
there was the same shortening of the pinna the same broad curve of the upper lobe the same convolution of the inner cartilage
in all essentials it was the same ear
of course i at once saw the enormous importance of the observation
it was evident that the victim was a blood relation and probably a very close one
i began to talk to her about her family and you remember that she at once gave us some exceedingly valuable details
in the first place her sister's name was sarah and her address had until recently been the same so that it was quite obvious how the mistake had occurred and for whom the packet was meant
then we heard of this steward married to the third sister and learned that he had at one time been so intimate with miss sarah that she had actually gone up to liverpool to be near the browners but a quarrel had afterwards divided them
this quarrel had put a stop to all communications for some months so that if browner had occasion to address a packet to miss sarah he would undoubtedly have done so to her old address
and now the matter had begun to straighten itself out wonderfully
we had learned of the existence of this steward an impulsive man of strong passions you remember that he threw up what must have been a very superior berth in order to be nearer to his wife subject too to occasional fits of hard drinking
we had reason to believe that his wife had been murdered and that a man presumably a seafaring man had been murdered at the same time
jealousy of course at once suggests itself as the motive for the crime
and why should these proofs of the deed be sent to miss sarah cushing
probably because during her residence in liverpool she had some hand in bringing about the events which led to the tragedy
you will observe that this line of boats calls at belfast dublin and waterford so that presuming that browner had committed the deed and had embarked at once upon his steamer the _may day_ belfast would be the first place at which he could post his terrible packet
a second solution was at this stage obviously possible and although i thought it exceedingly unlikely i was determined to elucidate it before going further
an unsuccessful lover might have killed mr
and mrs
browner and the male ear might have belonged to the husband
there were many grave objections to this theory but it was conceivable
i therefore sent off a telegram to my friend algar of the liverpool force and asked him to find out if mrs
browner were at home and if browner had departed in the _may day_
then we went on to wallington to visit miss sarah
i was curious in the first place to see how far the family ear had been reproduced in her
then of course she might give us very important information but i was not sanguine that she would
she must have heard of the business the day before since all croydon was ringing with it and she alone could have understood for whom the packet was meant
if she had been willing to help justice she would probably have communicated with the police already
however it was clearly our duty to see her so we went
we found that the news of the arrival of the packet for her illness dated from that time had such an effect upon her as to bring on brain fever
it was clearer than ever that she understood its full significance but equally clear that we should have to wait some time for any assistance from her
however we were really independent of her help
our answers were waiting for us at the police station where i had directed algar to send them
nothing could be more conclusive
mrs
browner's house had been closed for more than three days and the neighbours were of opinion that she had gone south to see her relatives
it had been ascertained at the shipping offices that browner had left aboard of the _may day_ and i calculate that she is due in the thames to morrow night
when he arrives he will be met by the obtuse but resolute lestrade and i have no doubt that we shall have all our details filled in sherlock holmes was not disappointed in his expectations
two days later he received a bulky envelope which contained a short note from the detective and a typewritten document which covered several pages of foolscap
lestrade has got him all right said holmes glancing up at me
perhaps it would interest you to hear what he says
my dear mr
holmes in accordance with the scheme which we had formed in order to test our theories the 'we' is rather fine watson is it not i went down to the albert dock yesterday at p m and boarded the s s
_may day_ belonging to the liverpool dublin and london steam packet company
on inquiry i found that there was a steward on board of the name of james browner and that he had acted during the voyage in such an extraordinary manner that the captain had been compelled to relieve him of his duties
on descending to his berth i found him seated upon a chest with his head sunk upon his hands rocking himself to and fro
he is a big powerful chap clean shaven and very swarthy something like aldridge who helped us in the bogus laundry affair
he jumped up when he heard my business and i had my whistle to my lips to call a couple of river police who were round the corner but he seemed to have no heart in him and he held out his hands quietly enough for the darbies
we brought him along to the cells and his box as well for we thought there might be something incriminating but bar a big sharp knife such as most sailors have we got nothing for our trouble
however we find that we shall want no more evidence for on being brought before the inspector at the station he asked leave to make a statement which was of course taken down just as he made it by our shorthand man
we had three copies typewritten one of which i enclose
the affair proves as i always thought it would to be an extremely simple one but i am obliged to you for assisting me in my investigation
with kind regards yours very truly g
lestrade hum
the investigation really was a very simple one remarked holmes but i don't think it struck him in that light when he first called us in
however let us see what jim browner has to say for himself
this is his statement as made before inspector montgomery at the shadwell police station and it has the advantage of being verbatim have i anything to say
yes i have a deal to say
i have to make a clean breast of it all
you can hang me or you can leave me alone
i don't care a plug which you do
i tell you i've not shut an eye in sleep since i did it and i don't believe i ever will again until i get past all waking
sometimes it's his face but most generally it's hers
i'm never without one or the other before me
he looks frowning and black like but she has a kind o' surprise upon her face
ay the white lamb she might well be surprised when she read death on a face that had seldom looked anything but love upon her before
but it was sarah's fault and may the curse of a broken man put a blight on her and set the blood rotting in her veins
it's not that i want to clear myself
i know that i went back to drink like the beast that i was
but she would have forgiven me she would have stuck as close to me as a rope to a block if that woman had never darkened our door
for sarah cushing loved me that's the root of the business she loved me until all her love turned to poisonous hate when she knew that i thought more of my wife's footmark in the mud than i did of her whole body and soul
there were three sisters altogether
the old one was just a good woman the second was a devil and the third was an angel
sarah was thirty three and mary was twenty nine when i married
we were just as happy as the day was long when we set up house together and in all liverpool there was no better woman than my mary
and then we asked sarah up for a week and the week grew into a month and one thing led to another until she was just one of ourselves
i was blue ribbon at that time and we were putting a little money by and all was as bright as a new dollar
my god whoever would have thought that it could have come to this
whoever would have dreamed it
i used to be home for the week ends very often and sometimes if the ship were held back for cargo i would have a whole week at a time and in this way i saw a deal of my sister in law sarah
she was a fine tall woman black and quick and fierce with a proud way of carrying her head and a glint from her eye like a spark from a flint
but when little mary was there i had never a thought of her and that i swear as i hope for god's mercy
it had seemed to me sometimes that she liked to be alone with me or to coax me out for a walk with her but i had never thought anything of that
but one evening my eyes were opened
i had come up from the ship and found my wife out but sarah at home
'where's mary ' i asked
'oh she has gone to pay some accounts ' i was impatient and paced up and down the room
'can't you be happy for five minutes without mary jim ' says she
'it's a bad compliment to me that you can't be contented with my society for so short a time ' 'that's all right my lass ' said i putting out my hand towards her in a kindly way but she had it in both hers in an instant and they burned as if they were in a fever
i looked into her eyes and i read it all there
there was no need for her to speak nor for me either
i frowned and drew my hand away
then she stood by my side in silence for a bit and then put up her hand and patted me on the shoulder
'steady old jim ' said she and with a kind o' mocking laugh she ran out of the room
well from that time sarah hated me with her whole heart and soul and she is a woman who can hate too
i was a fool to let her go on biding with us a besotted fool but i never said a word to mary for i knew it would grieve her
things went on much as before but after a time i began to find that there was a bit of a change in mary herself
she had always been so trusting and so innocent but now she became queer and suspicious wanting to know where i had been and what i had been doing and whom my letters were from and what i had in my pockets and a thousand such follies
day by day she grew queerer and more irritable and we had ceaseless rows about nothing
i was fairly puzzled by it all
sarah avoided me now but she and mary were just inseparable
i can see now how she was plotting and scheming and poisoning my wife's mind against me but i was such a blind beetle that i could not understand it at the time
then i broke my blue ribbon and began to drink again but i think i should not have done it if mary had been the same as ever
she had some reason to be disgusted with me now and the gap between us began to be wider and wider
and then this alec fairbairn chipped in and things became a thousand times blacker
it was to see sarah that he came to my house first but soon it was to see us for he was a man with winning ways and he made friends wherever he went
he was a dashing swaggering chap smart and curled who had seen half the world and could talk of what he had seen
he was good company i won't deny it and he had wonderful polite ways with him for a sailor man so that i think there must have been a time when he knew more of the poop than the forecastle
for a month he was in and out of my house and never once did it cross my mind that harm might come of his soft tricky ways
and then at last something made me suspect and from that day my peace was gone forever
it was only a little thing too
i had come into the parlour unexpected and as i walked in at the door i saw a light of welcome on my wife's face
but as she saw who it was it faded again and she turned away with a look of disappointment
that was enough for me
there was no one but alec fairbairn whose step she could have mistaken for mine
if i could have seen him then i should have killed him for i have always been like a madman when my temper gets loose
mary saw the devil's light in my eyes and she ran forward with her hands on my sleeve
'don't jim don't ' says she
'where's sarah ' i asked
'in the kitchen ' says she
'sarah ' says i as i went in 'this man fairbairn is never to darken my door again ' 'why not ' says she
'because i order it ' 'oh ' says she 'if my friends are not good enough for this house then i am not good enough for it either ' 'you can do what you like ' says i 'but if fairbairn shows his face here again i'll send you one of his ears for a keepsake ' she was frightened by my face i think for she never answered a word and the same evening she left my house
well i don't know now whether it was pure devilry on the part of this woman or whether she thought that she could turn me against my wife by encouraging her to misbehave
anyway she took a house just two streets off and let lodgings to sailors
fairbairn used to stay there and mary would go round to have tea with her sister and him
how often she went i don't know but i followed her one day and as i broke in at the door fairbairn got away over the back garden wall like the cowardly skunk that he was
i swore to my wife that i would kill her if i found her in his company again and i led her back with me sobbing and trembling and as white as a piece of paper
there was no trace of love between us any longer
i could see that she hated me and feared me and when the thought of it drove me to drink then she despised me as well
well sarah found that she could not make a living in liverpool so she went back as i understand to live with her sister in croydon and things jogged on much the same as ever at home
and then came this last week and all the misery and ruin
it was in this way
we had gone on the _may day_ for a round voyage of seven days but a hogshead got loose and started one of our plates so that we had to put back into port for twelve hours
i left the ship and came home thinking what a surprise it would be for my wife and hoping that maybe she would be glad to see me so soon
the thought was in my head as i turned into my own street and at that moment a cab passed me and there she was sitting by the side of fairbairn the two chatting and laughing with never a thought for me as i stood watching them from the footpath
i tell you and i give you my word for it that from that moment i was not my own master and it is all like a dim dream when i look back on it
i had been drinking hard of late and the two things together fairly turned my brain
there's something throbbing in my head now like a docker's hammer but that morning i seemed to have all niagara whizzing and buzzing in my ears
well i took to my heels and i ran after the cab
i had a heavy oak stick in my hand and i tell you i saw red from the first but as i ran i got cunning too and hung back a little to see them without being seen
they pulled up soon at the railway station
there was a good crowd round the booking office so i got quite close to them without being seen
they took tickets for new brighton
so did i but i got in three carriages behind them
when we reached it they walked along the parade and i was never more than a hundred yards from them
at last i saw them hire a boat and start for a row for it was a very hot day and they thought no doubt that it would be cooler on the water
it was just as if they had been given into my hands
there was a bit of a haze and you could not see more than a few hundred yards
i hired a boat for myself and i pulled after them
i could see the blur of their craft but they were going nearly as fast as i and they must have been a long mile from the shore before i caught them up
the haze was like a curtain all round us and there were we three in the middle of it
my god shall i ever forget their faces when they saw who was in the boat that was closing in upon them
she screamed out
he swore like a madman and jabbed at me with an oar for he must have seen death in my eyes
i got past it and got one in with my stick that crushed his head like an egg
i would have spared her perhaps for all my madness but she threw her arms round him crying out to him and calling him 'alec ' i struck again and she lay stretched beside him
i was like a wild beast then that had tasted blood
if sarah had been there by the lord she should have joined them
i pulled out my knife and well there
i've said enough
it gave me a kind of savage joy when i thought how sarah would feel when she had such signs as these of what her meddling had brought about
then i tied the bodies into the boat stove a plank and stood by until they had sunk
i knew very well that the owner would think that they had lost their bearings in the haze and had drifted off out to sea
i cleaned myself up got back to land and joined my ship without a soul having a suspicion of what had passed
that night i made up the packet for sarah cushing and next day i sent it from belfast
there you have the whole truth of it
you can hang me or do what you like with me but you cannot punish me as i have been punished already
i cannot shut my eyes but i see those two faces staring at me staring at me as they stared when my boat broke through the haze
i killed them quick but they are killing me slow and if i have another night of it i shall be either mad or dead before morning
you won't put me alone into a cell sir
for pity's sake don't and may you be treated in your day of agony as you treat me now ' what is the meaning of it watson said holmes solemnly as he laid down the paper
what object is served by this circle of misery and violence and fear
it must tend to some end or else our universe is ruled by chance which is unthinkable
but what end
there is the great standing perennial problem to which human reason is as far from an answer as ever an anomaly which often struck me in the character of my friend sherlock holmes was that although in his methods of thought he was the neatest and most methodical of mankind and although also he affected a certain quiet primness of dress he was none the less in his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever drove a fellow lodger to distraction
not that i am in the least conventional in that respect myself
the rough and tumble work in afghanistan coming on the top of a natural bohemianism of disposition has made me rather more lax than befits a medical man
but with me there is a limit and when i find a man who keeps his cigars in the coal scuttle his tobacco in the toe end of a persian slipper and his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack knife into the very centre of his wooden mantelpiece then i begin to give myself virtuous airs
i have always held too that pistol practice should be distinctly an open air pastime and when holmes in one of his queer humours would sit in an armchair with his hair trigger and a hundred boxer cartridges and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with a patriotic v r done in bullet pocks i felt strongly that neither the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room was improved by it
our chambers were always full of chemicals and of criminal relics which had a way of wandering into unlikely positions and of turning up in the butter dish or in even less desirable places
but his papers were my great crux
he had a horror of destroying documents especially those which were connected with his past cases and yet it was only once in every year or two that he would muster energy to docket and arrange them for as i have mentioned somewhere in these incoherent memoirs the outbursts of passionate energy when he performed the remarkable feats with which his name is associated were followed by reactions of lethargy during which he would lie about with his violin and his books hardly moving save from the sofa to the table
thus month after month his papers accumulated until every corner of the room was stacked with bundles of manuscript which were on no account to be burned and which could not be put away save by their owner
one winter's night as we sat together by the fire i ventured to suggest to him that as he had finished pasting extracts into his common place book he might employ the next two hours in making our room a little more habitable
he could not deny the justice of my request so with a rather rueful face he went off to his bedroom from which he returned presently pulling a large tin box behind him
this he placed in the middle of the floor and squatting down upon a stool in front of it he threw back the lid
i could see that it was already a third full of bundles of paper tied up with red tape into separate packages
there are cases enough here watson said he looking at me with mischievous eyes
i think that if you knew all that i had in this box you would ask me to pull some out instead of putting others in these are the records of your early work then i asked
i have often wished that i had notes of those cases yes my boy these were all done prematurely before my biographer had come to glorify me he lifted bundle after bundle in a tender caressing sort of way
they are not all successes watson said he
but there are some pretty little problems among them
here's the record of the tarleton murders and the case of vamberry the wine merchant and the adventure of the old russian woman and the singular affair of the aluminium crutch as well as a full account of ricoletti of the club foot and his abominable wife
and here ah now this really is something a little _recherche_ he dived his arm down to the bottom of the chest and brought up a small wooden box with a sliding lid such as children's toys are kept in
from within he produced a crumpled piece of paper an old fashioned brass key a peg of wood with a ball of string attached to it and three rusty old disks of metal
well my boy what do you make of this lot he asked smiling at my expression
it is a curious collection very curious and the story that hangs round it will strike you as being more curious still these relics have a history then so much so that they _are_ history what do you mean by that sherlock holmes picked them up one by one and laid them along the edge of the table
then he reseated himself in his chair and looked them over with a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes
these said he are all that i have left to remind me of the adventure of the musgrave ritual i had heard him mention the case more than once though i had never been able to gather the details
i should be so glad said i if you would give me an account of it and leave the litter as it is he cried mischievously
your tidiness won't bear much strain after all watson
but i should be glad that you should add this case to your annals for there are points in it which make it quite unique in the criminal records of this or i believe of any other country
a collection of my trifling achievements would certainly be incomplete which contained no account of this very singular business
you may remember how the affair of the _gloria scott_ and my conversation with the unhappy man whose fate i told you of first turned my attention in the direction of the profession which has become my life's work
you see me now when my name has become known far and wide and when i am generally recognised both by the public and by the official force as being a final court of appeal in doubtful cases
even when you knew me first at the time of the affair which you have commemorated in 'a study in scarlet ' i had already established a considerable though not a very lucrative connection
you can hardly realize then how difficult i found it at first and how long i had to wait before i succeeded in making any headway
when i first came up to london i had rooms in montague street just round the corner from the british museum and there i waited filling in my too abundant leisure time by studying all those branches of science which might make me more efficient
now and again cases came in my way principally through the introduction of old fellow students for during my last years at the university there was a good deal of talk there about myself and my methods
the third of these cases was that of the musgrave ritual and it is to the interest which was aroused by that singular chain of events and the large issues which proved to be at stake that i trace my first stride towards the position which i now hold
reginald musgrave had been in the same college as myself and i had some slight acquaintance with him
he was not generally popular among the undergraduates though it always seemed to me that what was set down as pride was really an attempt to cover extreme natural diffidence
in appearance he was a man of exceedingly aristocratic type thin high nosed and large eyed with languid and yet courtly manners
he was indeed a scion of one of the very oldest families in the kingdom though his branch was a cadet one which had separated from the northern musgraves some time in the sixteenth century and had established itself in western sussex where the manor house of hurlstone is perhaps the oldest inhabited building in the county
something of his birthplace seemed to cling to the man and i never looked at his pale keen face or the poise of his head without associating him with grey archways and mullioned windows and all the venerable wreckage of a feudal keep
once or twice we drifted into talk and i can remember that more than once he expressed a keen interest in my methods of observation and inference
for four years i had seen nothing of him until one morning he walked into my room in montague street
he had changed little was dressed like a young man of fashion he was always a bit of a dandy and preserved the same quiet suave manner which had formerly distinguished him
'how has all gone with you musgrave ' i asked after we had cordially shaken hands
'you probably heard of my poor father's death ' said he 'he was carried off about two years ago
since then i have of course had the hurlstone estates to manage and as i am member for my district as well my life has been a busy one
but i understand holmes that you are turning to practical ends those powers with which you used to amaze us ' 'yes ' said i 'i have taken to living by my wits ' 'i am delighted to hear it for your advice at present would be exceedingly valuable to me
we have had some very strange doings at hurlstone and the police have been able to throw no light upon the matter
it is really the most extraordinary and inexplicable business ' you can imagine with what eagerness i listened to him watson for the very chance for which i had been panting during all those months of inaction seemed to have come within my reach
in my inmost heart i believed that i could succeed where others failed and now i had the opportunity to test myself
'pray let me have the details ' i cried
reginald musgrave sat down opposite to me and lit the cigarette which i had pushed towards him
'you must know ' said he 'that though i am a bachelor i have to keep up a considerable staff of servants at hurlstone for it is a rambling old place and takes a good deal of looking after
i preserve too and in the pheasant months i usually have a house party so that it would not do to be short handed
altogether there are eight maids the cook the butler two footmen and a boy
the garden and the stables of course have a separate staff
'of these servants the one who had been longest in our service was brunton the butler
he was a young schoolmaster out of place when he was first taken up by my father but he was a man of great energy and character and he soon became quite invaluable in the household
he was a well grown handsome man with a splendid forehead and though he has been with us for twenty years he cannot be more than forty now
with his personal advantages and his extraordinary gifts for he can speak several languages and play nearly every musical instrument it is wonderful that he should have been satisfied so long in such a position but i suppose that he was comfortable and lacked energy to make any change
the butler of hurlstone is always a thing that is remembered by all who visit us
'but this paragon has one fault
he is a bit of a don juan and you can imagine that for a man like him it is not a very difficult part to play in a quiet country district
when he was married it was all right but since he has been a widower we have had no end of trouble with him
a few months ago we were in hopes that he was about to settle down again for he became engaged to rachel howells our second housemaid but he has thrown her over since then and taken up with janet tregellis the daughter of the head gamekeeper
rachel who is a very good girl but of an excitable welsh temperament had a sharp touch of brain fever and goes about the house now or did until yesterday like a black eyed shadow of her former self
that was our first drama at hurlstone but a second one came to drive it from our minds and it was prefaced by the disgrace and dismissal of butler brunton
'this was how it came about
i have said that the man was intelligent and this very intelligence has caused his ruin for it seems to have led to an insatiable curiosity about things which did not in the least concern him
i had no idea of the lengths to which this would carry him until the merest accident opened my eyes to it
'i have said that the house is a rambling one
one day last week on thursday night to be more exact i found that i could not sleep having foolishly taken a cup of strong _cafe noir_ after my dinner
after struggling against it until two in the morning i felt that it was quite hopeless so i rose and lit the candle with the intention of continuing a novel which i was reading
the book however had been left in the billiard room so i pulled on my dressing gown and started off to get it
'in order to reach the billiard room i had to descend a flight of stairs and then to cross the head of a passage which led to the library and the gun room
you can imagine my surprise when as i looked down this corridor i saw a glimmer of light coming from the open door of the library
i had myself extinguished the lamp and closed the door before coming to bed
naturally my first thought was of burglars
the corridors at hurlstone have their walls largely decorated with trophies of old weapons
from one of these i picked a battle axe and then leaving my candle behind me i crept on tiptoe down the passage and peeped in at the open door
'brunton the butler was in the library
he was sitting fully dressed in an easy chair with a slip of paper which looked like a map upon his knee and his forehead sunk forward upon his hand in deep thought
i stood dumb with astonishment watching him from the darkness
a small taper on the edge of the table shed a feeble light which sufficed to show me that he was fully dressed
suddenly as i looked he rose from his chair and walking over to a bureau at the side he unlocked it and drew out one of the drawers
from this he took a paper and returning to his seat he flattened it out beside the taper on the edge of the table and began to study it with minute attention
my indignation at this calm examination of our family documents overcame me so far that i took a step forward and brunton looking up saw me standing in the doorway
he sprang to his feet his face turned livid with fear and he thrust into his breast the chart like paper which he had been originally studying
' so said i
this is how you repay the trust which we have reposed in you
you will leave my service to morrow 'he bowed with the look of a man who is utterly crushed and slunk past me without a word
the taper was still on the table and by its light i glanced to see what the paper was which brunton had taken from the bureau
to my surprise it was nothing of any importance at all but simply a copy of the questions and answers in the singular old observance called the musgrave ritual
it is a sort of ceremony peculiar to our family which each musgrave for centuries past has gone through on his coming of age a thing of private interest and perhaps of some little importance to the archaeologist like our own blazonings and charges but of no practical use whatever ' 'we had better come back to the paper afterwards ' said i
'if you think it really necessary ' he answered with some hesitation
'to continue my statement however i relocked the bureau using the key which brunton had left and i had turned to go when i was surprised to find that the butler had returned and was standing before me
' mr
musgrave sir he cried in a voice which was hoarse with emotion i can't bear disgrace sir
i've always been proud above my station in life and disgrace would kill me
my blood will be on your head sir it will indeed if you drive me to despair
if you cannot keep me after what has passed then for god's sake let me give you notice and leave in a month as if of my own free will
i could stand that mr
musgrave but not to be cast out before all the folk that i know so well ' you don't deserve much consideration brunton i answered
your conduct has been most infamous
however as you have been a long time in the family i have no wish to bring public disgrace upon you
a month however is too long
take yourself away in a week and give what reason you like for going ' only a week sir he cried in a despairing voice
a fortnight say at least a fortnight ' a week i repeated and you may consider yourself to have been very leniently dealt with 'he crept away his face sunk upon his breast like a broken man while i put out the light and returned to my room
'for two days after this brunton was most assiduous in his attention to his duties
i made no allusion to what had passed and waited with some curiosity to see how he would cover his disgrace
on the third morning however he did not appear as was his custom after breakfast to receive my instructions for the day
as i left the dining room i happened to meet rachel howells the maid
i have told you that she had only recently recovered from an illness and was looking so wretchedly pale and wan that i remonstrated with her for being at work
' you should be in bed i said
come back to your duties when you are stronger 'she looked at me with so strange an expression that i began to suspect that her brain was affected
' i am strong enough mr
musgrave said she
' we will see what the doctor says i answered
you must stop work now and when you go downstairs just say that i wish to see brunton ' the butler is gone said she
' gone
gone where ' he is gone
no one has seen him
he is not in his room
oh yes he is gone he is gone she fell back against the wall with shriek after shriek of laughter while i horrified at this sudden hysterical attack rushed to the bell to summon help
the girl was taken to her room still screaming and sobbing while i made inquiries about brunton
there was no doubt about it that he had disappeared
his bed had not been slept in he had been seen by no one since he had retired to his room the night before and yet it was difficult to see how he could have left the house as both windows and doors were found to be fastened in the morning
his clothes his watch and even his money were in his room but the black suit which he usually wore was missing
his slippers too were gone but his boots were left behind
where then could butler brunton have gone in the night and what could have become of him now
'of course we searched the house from cellar to garret but there was no trace of him
it is as i have said a labyrinth of an old house especially the original wing which is now practically uninhabited but we ransacked every room and cellar without discovering the least sign of the missing man
it was incredible to me that he could have gone away leaving all his property behind him and yet where could he be
i called in the local police but without success
rain had fallen on the night before and we examined the lawn and the paths all round the house but in vain
matters were in this state when a new development quite drew our attention away from the original mystery
'for two days rachel howells had been so ill sometimes delirious sometimes hysterical that a nurse had been employed to sit up with her at night
on the third night after brunton's disappearance the nurse finding her patient sleeping nicely had dropped into a nap in the armchair when she woke in the early morning to find the bed empty the window open and no signs of the invalid
i was instantly aroused and with the two footmen started off at once in search of the missing girl
it was not difficult to tell the direction which she had taken for starting from under her window we could follow her footmarks easily across the lawn to the edge of the mere where they vanished close to the gravel path which leads out of the grounds
the lake there is eight feet deep and you can imagine our feelings when we saw that the trail of the poor demented girl came to an end at the edge of it
'of course we had the drags at once and set to work to recover the remains but no trace of the body could we find
on the other hand we brought to the surface an object of a most unexpected kind
it was a linen bag which contained within it a mass of old rusted and discoloured metal and several dull coloured pieces of pebble or glass
this strange find was all that we could get from the mere and although we made every possible search and inquiry yesterday we know nothing of the fate either of rachel howells or of richard brunton
the county police are at their wits' end and i have come up to you as a last resource ' you can imagine watson with what eagerness i listened to this extraordinary sequence of events and endeavoured to piece them together and to devise some common thread upon which they might all hang
the butler was gone
the maid was gone
the maid had loved the butler but had afterwards had cause to hate him
she was of welsh blood fiery and passionate
she had been terribly excited immediately after his disappearance
she had flung into the lake a bag containing some curious contents
these were all factors which had to be taken into consideration and yet none of them got quite to the heart of the matter
what was the starting point of this chain of events
there lay the end of this tangled line
'i must see that paper musgrave ' said i 'which this butler of yours thought it worth his while to consult even at the risk of the loss of his place ' 'it is rather an absurd business this ritual of ours ' he answered
'but it has at least the saving grace of antiquity to excuse it
i have a copy of the questions and answers here if you care to run your eye over them ' he handed me the very paper which i have here watson and this is the strange catechism to which each musgrave had to submit when he came to man's estate
i will read you the questions and answers as they stand
'whose was it ' 'his who is gone ' 'who shall have it ' 'he who will come ' 'where was the sun ' 'over the oak ' 'where was the shadow ' 'under the elm ' how was it stepped ' 'north by ten and by ten east by five and by five south by two and by two west by one and by one and so under ' 'what shall we give for it ' 'all that is ours ' 'why should we give it ' 'for the sake of the trust ' 'the original has no date but is in the spelling of the middle of the seventeenth century ' remarked musgrave
'i am afraid however that it can be of little help to you in solving this mystery ' 'at least ' said i 'it gives us another mystery and one which is even more interesting than the first
it may be that the solution of the one may prove to be the solution of the other
you will excuse me musgrave if i say that your butler appears to me to have been a very clever man and to have had a clearer insight than ten generations of his masters ' 'i hardly follow you ' said musgrave
'the paper seems to me to be of no practical importance ' 'but to me it seems immensely practical and i fancy that brunton took the same view
he had probably seen it before that night on which you caught him ' 'it is very possible
we took no pains to hide it ' 'he simply wished i should imagine to refresh his memory upon that last occasion
he had as i understand some sort of map or chart which he was comparing with the manuscript and which he thrust into his pocket when you appeared ' 'that is true
but what could he have to do with this old family custom of ours and what does this rigmarole mean ' 'i don't think that we should have much difficulty in determining that ' said i 'with your permission we will take the first train down to sussex and go a little more deeply into the matter upon the spot ' the same afternoon saw us both at hurlstone
possibly you have seen pictures and read descriptions of the famous old building so i will confine my account of it to saying that it is built in the shape of an l the long arm being the more modern portion and the shorter the ancient nucleus from which the other had developed
over the low heavily lintelled door in the centre of this old part is chiseled the date but experts are agreed that the beams and stonework are really much older than this
the enormously thick walls and tiny windows of this part had in the last century driven the family into building the new wing and the old one was used now as a storehouse and a cellar when it was used at all
a splendid park with fine old timber surrounds the house and the lake to which my client had referred lay close to the avenue about two hundred yards from the building
i was already firmly convinced watson that there were not three separate mysteries here but one only and that if i could read the musgrave ritual aright i should hold in my hand the clue which would lead me to the truth concerning both the butler brunton and the maid howells
to that then i turned all my energies
why should this servant be so anxious to master this old formula
evidently because he saw something in it which had escaped all those generations of country squires and from which he expected some personal advantage
what was it then and how had it affected his fate
it was perfectly obvious to me on reading the ritual that the measurements must refer to some spot to which the rest of the document alluded and that if we could find that spot we should be in a fair way towards finding what the secret was which the old musgraves had thought it necessary to embalm in so curious a fashion
there were two guides given us to start with an oak and an elm
as to the oak there could be no question at all
right in front of the house upon the left hand side of the drive there stood a patriarch among oaks one of the most magnificent trees that i have ever seen
'that was there when your ritual was drawn up ' said i as we drove past it
'it was there at the norman conquest in all probability ' he answered
'it has a girth of twenty three feet ' 'have you any old elms ' i asked
'there used to be a very old one over yonder but it was struck by lightning ten years ago and we cut down the stump ' 'you can see where it used to be ' 'oh yes ' 'there are no other elms ' 'no old ones but plenty of beeches ' 'i should like to see where it grew ' we had driven up in a dog cart and my client led me away at once without our entering the house to the scar on the lawn where the elm had stood
it was nearly midway between the oak and the house
my investigation seemed to be progressing
'i suppose it is impossible to find out how high the elm was ' i asked
'i can give you it at once
it was sixty four feet ' 'how do you come to know it ' i asked in surprise
'when my old tutor used to give me an exercise in trigonometry it always took the shape of measuring heights
when i was a lad i worked out every tree and building in the estate ' this was an unexpected piece of luck
my data were coming more quickly than i could have reasonably hoped
'tell me ' i asked 'did your butler ever ask you such a question ' reginald musgrave looked at me in astonishment
'now that you call it to my mind ' he answered 'brunton _did_ ask me about the height of the tree some months ago in connection with some little argument with the groom ' this was excellent news watson for it showed me that i was on the right road
i looked up at the sun
it was low in the heavens and i calculated that in less than an hour it would lie just above the topmost branches of the old oak
one condition mentioned in the ritual would then be fulfilled
and the shadow of the elm must mean the farther end of the shadow otherwise the trunk would have been chosen as the guide
i had then to find where the far end of the shadow would fall when the sun was just clear of the oak that must have been difficult holmes when the elm was no longer there well at least i knew that if brunton could do it i could also
besides there was no real difficulty
i went with musgrave to his study and whittled myself this peg to which i tied this long string with a knot at each yard
then i took two lengths of a fishing rod which came to just six feet and i went back with my client to where the elm had been
the sun was just grazing the top of the oak
i fastened the rod on end marked out the direction of the shadow and measured it
it was nine feet in length
of course the calculation now was a simple one
if a rod of six feet threw a shadow of nine a tree of sixty four feet would throw one of ninety six and the line of the one would of course be the line of the other
i measured out the distance which brought me almost to the wall of the house and i thrust a peg into the spot
you can imagine my exultation watson when within two inches of my peg i saw a conical depression in the ground
i knew that it was the mark made by brunton in his measurements and that i was still upon his trail
from this starting point i proceeded to step having first taken the cardinal points by my pocket compass
ten steps with each foot took me along parallel with the wall of the house and again i marked my spot with a peg
then i carefully paced off five to the east and two to the south
it brought me to the very threshold of the old door
two steps to the west meant now that i was to go two paces down the stone flagged passage and this was the place indicated by the ritual
never have i felt such a cold chill of disappointment watson
for a moment it seemed to me that there must be some radical mistake in my calculations
the setting sun shone full upon the passage floor and i could see that the old foot worn grey stones with which it was paved were firmly cemented together and had certainly not been moved for many a long year
brunton had not been at work here
i tapped upon the floor but it sounded the same all over and there was no sign of any crack or crevice
but fortunately musgrave who had begun to appreciate the meaning of my proceedings and who was now as excited as myself took out his manuscript to check my calculation
'and under ' he cried
'you have omitted the and under ' i had thought that it meant that we were to dig but now of course i saw at once that i was wrong
'there is a cellar under this then ' i cried
'yes and as old as the house
down here through this door ' we went down a winding stone stair and my companion striking a match lit a large lantern which stood on a barrel in the corner
in an instant it was obvious that we had at last come upon the true place and that we had not been the only people to visit the spot recently
it had been used for the storage of wood but the billets which had evidently been littered over the floor were now piled at the sides so as to leave a clear space in the middle
in this space lay a large and heavy flagstone with a rusted iron ring in the centre to which a thick shepherd's check muffler was attached
'by jove ' cried my client
'that's brunton's muffler
i have seen it on him and could swear to it
what has the villain been doing here ' at my suggestion a couple of the county police were summoned to be present and i then endeavoured to raise the stone by pulling on the cravat
i could only move it slightly and it was with the aid of one of the constables that i succeeded at last in carrying it to one side
a black hole yawned beneath into which we all peered while musgrave kneeling at the side pushed down the lantern
a small chamber about seven feet deep and four feet square lay open to us
at one side of this was a squat brass bound wooden box the lid of which was hinged upwards with this curious old fashioned key projecting from the lock
it was furred outside by a thick layer of dust and damp and worms had eaten through the wood so that a crop of livid fungi was growing on the inside of it
several discs of metal old coins apparently such as i hold here were scattered over the bottom of the box but it contained nothing else
at the moment however we had no thought for the old chest for our eyes were riveted upon that which crouched beside it
it was the figure of a man clad in a suit of black who squatted down upon his hams with his forehead sunk upon the edge of the box and his two arms thrown out on each side of it
the attitude had drawn all the stagnant blood to the face and no man could have recognised that distorted liver coloured countenance but his height his dress and his hair were all sufficient to show my client when we had drawn the body up that it was indeed his missing butler
he had been dead some days but there was no wound or bruise upon his person to show how he had met his dreadful end
when his body had been carried from the cellar we found ourselves still confronted with a problem which was almost as formidable as that with which we had started
i confess that so far watson i had been disappointed in my investigation
i had reckoned upon solving the matter when once i had found the place referred to in the ritual but now i was there and was apparently as far as ever from knowing what it was which the family had concealed with such elaborate precautions
it is true that i had thrown a light upon the fate of brunton but now i had to ascertain how that fate had come upon him and what part had been played in the matter by the woman who had disappeared
i sat down upon a keg in the corner and thought the whole matter carefully over
you know my methods in such cases watson
i put myself in the man's place and having first gauged his intelligence i try to imagine how i should myself have proceeded under the same circumstances
in this case the matter was simplified by brunton's intelligence being quite first rate so that it was unnecessary to make any allowance for the personal equation as the astronomers have dubbed it
he knew that something valuable was concealed
he had spotted the place
he found that the stone which covered it was just too heavy for a man to move unaided
what would he do next
he could not get help from outside even if he had some one whom he could trust without the unbarring of doors and considerable risk of detection
it was better if he could to have his helpmate inside the house
but whom could he ask
this girl had been devoted to him
a man always finds it hard to realize that he may have finally lost a woman's love however badly he may have treated her
he would try by a few attentions to make his peace with the girl howells and then would engage her as his accomplice
together they would come at night to the cellar and their united force would suffice to raise the stone
so far i could follow their actions as if i had actually seen them
but for two of them and one a woman it must have been heavy work the raising of that stone
a burly sussex policeman and i had found it no light job
what would they do to assist them
probably what i should have done myself
i rose and examined carefully the different billets of wood which were scattered round the floor
almost at once i came upon what i expected
one piece about three feet in length had a very marked indentation at one end while several were flattened at the sides as if they had been compressed by some considerable weight
evidently as they had dragged the stone up they had thrust the chunks of wood into the chink until at last when the opening was large enough to crawl through they would hold it open by a billet placed lengthwise which might very well become indented at the lower end since the whole weight of the stone would press it down on to the edge of this other slab
so far i was still on safe ground
and now how was i to proceed to reconstruct this midnight drama
clearly only one could fit into the hole and that one was brunton
the girl must have waited above
brunton then unlocked the box handed up the contents presumably since they were not to be found and then and then what happened
what smouldering fire of vengeance had suddenly sprung into flame in this passionate celtic woman's soul when she saw the man who had wronged her wronged her perhaps far more than we suspected in her power
was it a chance that the wood had slipped and that the stone had shut brunton into what had become his sepulchre
had she only been guilty of silence as to his fate
or had some sudden blow from her hand dashed the support away and sent the slab crashing down into its place
be that as it might i seemed to see that woman's figure still clutching at her treasure trove and flying wildly up the winding stair with her ears ringing perhaps with the muffled screams from behind her and with the drumming of frenzied hands against the slab of stone which was choking her faithless lover's life out
here was the secret of her blanched face her shaken nerves her peals of hysterical laughter on the next morning
but what had been in the box
what had she done with that
of course it must have been the old metal and pebbles which my client had dragged from the mere
she had thrown them in there at the first opportunity to remove the last trace of her crime
for twenty minutes i had sat motionless thinking the matter out
musgrave still stood with a very pale face swinging his lantern and peering down into the hole
'these are coins of charles the first ' said he holding out the few which had been in the box 'you see we were right in fixing our date for the ritual ' 'we may find something else of charles the first ' i cried as the probable meaning of the first two questions of the ritual broke suddenly upon me
'let me see the contents of the bag which you fished from the mere ' we ascended to his study and he laid the _debris_ before me
i could understand his regarding it as of small importance when i looked at it for the metal was almost black and the stones lustreless and dull
i rubbed one of them on my sleeve however and it glowed afterwards like a spark in the dark hollow of my hand
the metal work was in the form of a double ring but it had been bent and twisted out of its original shape
'you must bear in mind ' said i 'that the royal party made head in england even after the death of the king and that when they at last fled they probably left many of their most precious possessions buried behind them with the intention of returning for them in more peaceful times ' 'my ancestor sir ralph musgrave was a prominent cavalier and the right hand man of charles the second in his wanderings ' said my friend
'ah indeed ' i answered
'well now i think that really should give us the last link that we wanted
i must congratulate you on coming into the possession though in rather a tragic manner of a relic which is of great intrinsic value but of even greater importance as an historical curiosity ' 'what is it then ' he gasped in astonishment
'it is nothing less than the ancient crown of the kings of england ' 'the crown ' 'precisely
consider what the ritual says how does it run
whose was it his who is gone that was after the execution of charles
then who shall have it he who will come that was charles the second whose advent was already foreseen
there can i think be no doubt that this battered and shapeless diadem once encircled the brows of the royal stuarts ' 'and how came it in the pond ' 'ah that is a question that will take some time to answer ' and with that i sketched out to him the whole long chain of surmise and of proof which i had constructed
the twilight had closed in and the moon was shining brightly in the sky before my narrative was finished
'and how was it then that charles did not get his crown when he returned ' asked musgrave pushing back the relic into its linen bag
'ah there you lay your finger upon the one point which we shall probably never be able to clear up
it is likely that the musgrave who held the secret died in the interval and by some oversight left this guide to his descendant without explaining the meaning of it
from that day to this it has been handed down from father to son until at last it came within reach of a man who tore its secret out of it and lost his life in the venture ' and that's the story of the musgrave ritual watson
they have the crown down at hurlstone though they had some legal bother and a considerable sum to pay before they were allowed to retain it
i am sure that if you mentioned my name they would be happy to show it to you
of the woman nothing was ever heard and the probability is that she got away out of england and carried herself and the memory of her crime to some land beyond the seas it was some time before the health of my friend mr
sherlock holmes recovered from the strain caused by his immense exertions in the spring of '
the whole question of the netherland sumatra company and of the colossal schemes of baron maupertuis are too recent in the minds of the public and are too intimately concerned with politics and finance to be fitting subjects for this series of sketches
they led however in an indirect fashion to a singular and complex problem which gave my friend an opportunity of demonstrating the value of a fresh weapon among the many with which he waged his life long battle against crime
on referring to my notes i see that it was upon the 14th of april that i received a telegram from lyons which informed me that holmes was lying ill in the hotel dulong
within twenty four hours i was in his sick room and was relieved to find that there was nothing formidable in his symptoms
even his iron constitution however had broken down under the strain of an investigation which had extended over two months during which period he had never worked less than fifteen hours a day and had more than once as he assured me kept to his task for five days at a stretch
even the triumphant issue of his labours could not save him from reaction after so terrible an exertion and at a time when europe was ringing with his name and when his room was literally ankle deep with congratulatory telegrams i found him a prey to the blackest depression
even the knowledge that he had succeeded where the police of three countries had failed and that he had outmanoeuvred at every point the most accomplished swindler in europe was insufficient to rouse him from his nervous prostration
three days later we were back in baker street together but it was evident that my friend would be much the better for a change and the thought of a week of spring time in the country was full of attractions to me also
my old friend colonel hayter who had come under my professional care in afghanistan had now taken a house near reigate in surrey and had frequently asked me to come down to him upon a visit
on the last occasion he had remarked that if my friend would only come with me he would be glad to extend his hospitality to him also
a little diplomacy was needed but when holmes understood that the establishment was a bachelor one and that he would be allowed the fullest freedom he fell in with my plans and a week after our return from lyons we were under the colonel's roof
hayter was a fine old soldier who had seen much of the world and he soon found as i had expected that holmes and he had much in common
on the evening of our arrival we were sitting in the colonel's gun room after dinner holmes stretched upon the sofa while hayter and i looked over his little armoury of fire arms
by the way said he suddenly i think i'll take one of these pistols upstairs with me in case we have an alarm an alarm said i
yes we've had a scare in this part lately
old acton who is one of our county magnates had his house broken into last monday
no great damage done but the fellows are still at large no clue asked holmes cocking his eye at the colonel
none as yet
but the affair is a petty one one of our little country crimes which must seem too small for your attention mr
holmes after this great international affair holmes waved away the compliment though his smile showed that it had pleased him
was there any feature of interest i fancy not
the thieves ransacked the library and got very little for their pains
the whole place was turned upside down drawers burst open and presses ransacked with the result that an odd volume of pope's 'homer ' two plated candlesticks an ivory letter weight a small oak barometer and a ball of twine are all that have vanished what an extraordinary assortment i exclaimed
oh the fellows evidently grabbed hold of everything they could get holmes grunted from the sofa
the county police ought to make something of that said he why it is surely obvious that but i held up a warning finger
you are here for a rest my dear fellow
for heaven's sake don't get started on a new problem when your nerves are all in shreds holmes shrugged his shoulders with a glance of comic resignation towards the colonel and the talk drifted away into less dangerous channels
it was destined however that all my professional caution should be wasted for next morning the problem obtruded itself upon us in such a way that it was impossible to ignore it and our country visit took a turn which neither of us could have anticipated
we were at breakfast when the colonel's butler rushed in with all his propriety shaken out of him
have you heard the news sir he gasped
at the cunningham's sir burglary cried the colonel with his coffee cup in mid air
murder the colonel whistled
by jove said he
who's killed then
the j p
or his son neither sir
it was william the coachman
shot through the heart sir and never spoke again who shot him then the burglar sir
he was off like a shot and got clean away
he'd just broke in at the pantry window when william came on him and met his end in saving his master's property what time it was last night sir somewhere about twelve ah then we'll step over afterwards said the colonel coolly settling down to his breakfast again
it's a baddish business he added when the butler had gone he's our leading man about here is old cunningham and a very decent fellow too
he'll be cut up over this for the man has been in his service for years and was a good servant
it's evidently the same villains who broke into acton's and stole that very singular collection said holmes thoughtfully
precisely hum
it may prove the simplest matter in the world but all the same at first glance this is just a little curious is it not
a gang of burglars acting in the country might be expected to vary the scene of their operations and not to crack two cribs in the same district within a few days
when you spoke last night of taking precautions i remember that it passed through my mind that this was probably the last parish in england to which the thief or thieves would be likely to turn their attention which shows that i have still much to learn i fancy it's some local practitioner said the colonel
in that case of course acton's and cunningham's are just the places he would go for since they are far the largest about here and richest well they ought to be but they've had a lawsuit for some years which has sucked the blood out of both of them i fancy
old acton has some claim on half cunningham's estate and the lawyers have been at it with both hands if it's a local villain there should not be much difficulty in running him down said holmes with a yawn
all right watson i don't intend to meddle inspector forrester sir said the butler throwing open the door
the official a smart keen faced young fellow stepped into the room
good morning colonel said he i hope i don't intrude but we hear that mr
holmes of baker street is here the colonel waved his hand towards my friend and the inspector bowed
we thought that perhaps you would care to step across mr
holmes the fates are against you watson said he laughing
we were chatting about the matter when you came in inspector
perhaps you can let us have a few details as he leaned back in his chair in the familiar attitude i knew that the case was hopeless
we had no clue in the acton affair
but here we have plenty to go on and there's no doubt it is the same party in each case
the man was seen ah yes sir
but he was off like a deer after the shot that killed poor william kirwan was fired
mr
cunningham saw him from the bedroom window and mr
alec cunningham saw him from the back passage
it was quarter to twelve when the alarm broke out
mr
cunningham had just got into bed and mr
alec was smoking a pipe in his dressing gown
they both heard william the coachman calling for help and mr
alec ran down to see what was the matter
the back door was open and as he came to the foot of the stairs he saw two men wrestling together outside
one of them fired a shot the other dropped and the murderer rushed across the garden and over the hedge
mr
cunningham looking out of his bedroom saw the fellow as he gained the road but lost sight of him at once
mr
alec stopped to see if he could help the dying man and so the villain got clean away
beyond the fact that he was a middle sized man and dressed in some dark stuff we have no personal clue but we are making energetic inquiries and if he is a stranger we shall soon find him out what was this william doing there
did he say anything before he died not a word
he lives at the lodge with his mother and as he was a very faithful fellow we imagine that he walked up to the house with the intention of seeing that all was right there
of course this acton business has put every one on their guard
the robber must have just burst open the door the lock has been forced when william came upon him did william say anything to his mother before going out she is very old and deaf and we can get no information from her
the shock has made her half witted but i understand that she was never very bright
there is one very important circumstance however
look at this he took a small piece of torn paper from a note book and spread it out upon his knee
this was found between the finger and thumb of the dead man
it appears to be a fragment torn from a larger sheet
you will observe that the hour mentioned upon it is the very time at which the poor fellow met his fate
you see that his murderer might have torn the rest of the sheet from him or he might have taken this fragment from the murderer
it reads almost as though it were an appointment holmes took up the scrap of paper a facsimile of which is here reproduced
scrap of paper presuming that it is an appointment continued the inspector it is of course a conceivable theory that this william kirwan though he had the reputation of being an honest man may have been in league with the thief
he may have met him there may even have helped him to break in the door and then they may have fallen out between themselves this writing is of extraordinary interest said holmes who had been examining it with intense concentration
these are much deeper waters than i had thought he sank his head upon his hands while the inspector smiled at the effect which his case had had upon the famous london specialist
your last remark said holmes presently as to the possibility of there being an understanding between the burglar and the servant and this being a note of appointment from one to the other is an ingenious and not entirely impossible supposition
but this writing opens up he sank his head into his hands again and remained for some minutes in the deepest thought
when he raised his face again i was surprised to see that his cheek was tinged with colour and his eyes as bright as before his illness
he sprang to his feet with all his old energy
i'll tell you what said he i should like to have a quiet little glance into the details of this case
there is something in it which fascinates me extremely
if you will permit me colonel i will leave my friend watson and you and i will step round with the inspector to test the truth of one or two little fancies of mine
i will be with you again in half an hour an hour and half had elapsed before the inspector returned alone
mr
holmes is walking up and down in the field outside said he
he wants us all four to go up to the house together to mr
cunningham's yes sir what for the inspector shrugged his shoulders
i don't quite know sir
between ourselves i think mr
holmes had not quite got over his illness yet
he's been behaving very queerly and he is very much excited i don't think you need alarm yourself said i
i have usually found that there was method in his madness some folks might say there was madness in his method muttered the inspector
but he's all on fire to start colonel so we had best go out if you are ready we found holmes pacing up and down in the field his chin sunk upon his breast and his hands thrust into his trousers pockets
the matter grows in interest said he
watson your country trip has been a distinct success
i have had a charming morning you have been up to the scene of the crime i understand said the colonel
yes the inspector and i have made quite a little reconnaissance together any success well we have seen some very interesting things
i'll tell you what we did as we walk
first of all we saw the body of this unfortunate man
he certainly died from a revolver wound as reported had you doubted it then oh it is as well to test everything
our inspection was not wasted
we then had an interview with mr
cunningham and his son who were able to point out the exact spot where the murderer had broken through the garden hedge in his flight
that was of great interest naturally then we had a look at this poor fellow's mother
we could get no information from her however as she is very old and feeble and what is the result of your investigations the conviction that the crime is a very peculiar one
perhaps our visit now may do something to make it less obscure
i think that we are both agreed inspector that the fragment of paper in the dead man's hand bearing as it does the very hour of his death written upon it is of extreme importance it should give a clue mr
holmes it _does_ give a clue
whoever wrote that note was the man who brought william kirwan out of his bed at that hour
but where is the rest of that sheet of paper i examined the ground carefully in the hope of finding it said the inspector
it was torn out of the dead man's hand
why was some one so anxious to get possession of it
because it incriminated him
and what would he do with it
thrust it into his pocket most likely never noticing that a corner of it had been left in the grip of the corpse
if we could get the rest of that sheet it is obvious that we should have gone a long way towards solving the mystery yes but how can we get at the criminal's pocket before we catch the criminal well well it was worth thinking over
then there is another obvious point
the note was sent to william
the man who wrote it could not have taken it otherwise of course he might have delivered his own message by word of mouth
who brought the note then
or did it come through the post i have made inquiries said the inspector
william received a letter by the afternoon post yesterday
the envelope was destroyed by him excellent cried holmes clapping the inspector on the back
you've seen the postman
it is a pleasure to work with you
well here is the lodge and if you will come up colonel i will show you the scene of the crime we passed the pretty cottage where the murdered man had lived and walked up an oak lined avenue to the fine old queen anne house which bears the date of malplaquet upon the lintel of the door
holmes and the inspector led us round it until we came to the side gate which is separated by a stretch of garden from the hedge which lines the road
a constable was standing at the kitchen door
throw the door open officer said holmes
now it was on those stairs that young mr
cunningham stood and saw the two men struggling just where we are
old mr
cunningham was at that window the second on the left and he saw the fellow get away just to the left of that bush
then mr
alec ran out and knelt beside the wounded man
the ground is very hard you see and there are no marks to guide us as he spoke two men came down the garden path from round the angle of the house
the one was an elderly man with a strong deep lined heavy eyed face the other a dashing young fellow whose bright smiling expression and showy dress were in strange contrast with the business which had brought us there
still at it then said he to holmes
i thought you londoners were never at fault
you don't seem to be so very quick after all ah you must give us a little time said holmes good humoredly
you'll want it said young alec cunningham
why i don't see that we have any clue at all there's only one answered the inspector
we thought that if we could only find good heavens mr
holmes
what is the matter my poor friend's face had suddenly assumed the most dreadful expression
his eyes rolled upwards his features writhed in agony and with a suppressed groan he dropped on his face upon the ground
horrified at the suddenness and severity of the attack we carried him into the kitchen where he lay back in a large chair and breathed heavily for some minutes
finally with a shamefaced apology for his weakness he rose once more
watson would tell you that i have only just recovered from a severe illness he explained
i am liable to these sudden nervous attacks shall i send you home in my trap asked old cunningham
well since i am here there is one point on which i should like to feel sure
we can very easily verify it what was it well it seems to me that it is just possible that the arrival of this poor fellow william was not before but after the entrance of the burglar into the house
you appear to take it for granted that although the door was forced the robber never got in i fancy that is quite obvious said mr
cunningham gravely
why my son alec had not yet gone to bed and he would certainly have heard any one moving about where was he sitting i was smoking in my dressing room which window is that the last on the left next my father's both of your lamps were lit of course undoubtedly there are some very singular points here said holmes smiling
is it not extraordinary that a burglar and a burglar who had had some previous experience should deliberately break into a house at a time when he could see from the lights that two of the family were still afoot he must have been a cool hand well of course if the case were not an odd one we should not have been driven to ask you for an explanation said young mr
alec
but as to your ideas that the man had robbed the house before william tackled him i think it a most absurd notion
wouldn't we have found the place disarranged and missed the things which he had taken it depends on what the things were said holmes
you must remember that we are dealing with a burglar who is a very peculiar fellow and who appears to work on lines of his own
look for example at the queer lot of things which he took from acton's what was it a ball of string a letter weight and i don't know what other odds and ends well we are quite in your hands mr
holmes said old cunningham
anything which you or the inspector may suggest will most certainly be done in the first place said holmes i should like you to offer a reward coming from yourself for the officials may take a little time before they would agree upon the sum and these things cannot be done too promptly
i have jotted down the form here if you would not mind signing it
fifty pounds was quite enough i thought i would willingly give five hundred said the j p taking the slip of paper and the pencil which holmes handed to him
this is not quite correct however he added glancing over the document
i wrote it rather hurriedly you see you begin 'whereas at about a quarter to one on tuesday morning an attempt was made ' and so on
it was at a quarter to twelve as a matter of fact i was pained at the mistake for i knew how keenly holmes would feel any slip of the kind
it was his specialty to be accurate as to fact but his recent illness had shaken him and this one little incident was enough to show me that he was still far from being himself
he was obviously embarrassed for an instant while the inspector raised his eyebrows and alec cunningham burst into a laugh
the old gentleman corrected the mistake however and handed the paper back to holmes
get it printed as soon as possible he said i think your idea is an excellent one holmes put the slip of paper carefully away into his pocket book
and now said he it really would be a good thing that we should all go over the house together and make certain that this rather erratic burglar did not after all carry anything away with him before entering holmes made an examination of the door which had been forced
it was evident that a chisel or strong knife had been thrust in and the lock forced back with it
we could see the marks in the wood where it had been pushed in
you don't use bars then he asked
we have never found it necessary you don't keep a dog yes but he is chained on the other side of the house when do the servants go to bed about ten i understand that william was usually in bed also at that hour yes it is singular that on this particular night he should have been up
now i should be very glad if you would have the kindness to show us over the house mr
cunningham a stone flagged passage with the kitchens branching away from it led by a wooden staircase directly to the first floor of the house
it came out upon the landing opposite to a second more ornamental stair which came up from the front hall
out of this landing opened the drawing room and several bedrooms including those of mr
cunningham and his son
holmes walked slowly taking keen note of the architecture of the house
i could tell from his expression that he was on a hot scent and yet i could not in the least imagine in what direction his inferences were leading him
my good sir said mr
cunningham with some impatience this is surely very unnecessary
that is my room at the end of the stairs and my son's is the one beyond it
i leave it to your judgment whether it was possible for the thief to have come up here without disturbing us you must try round and get on a fresh scent i fancy said the son with a rather malicious smile
still i must ask you to humour me a little further
i should like for example to see how far the windows of the bedrooms command the front
this i understand is your son's room he pushed open the door and that i presume is the dressing room in which he sat smoking when the alarm was given
where does the window of that look out to he stepped across the bedroom pushed open the door and glanced round the other chamber
i hope that you are satisfied now said mr
cunningham tartly
thank you i think i have seen all that i wished then if it is really necessary we can go into my room if it is not too much trouble the j p
shrugged his shoulders and led the way into his own chamber which was a plainly furnished and commonplace room
as we moved across it in the direction of the window holmes fell back until he and i were the last of the group
near the foot of the bed stood a dish of oranges and a carafe of water
as we passed it holmes to my unutterable astonishment leaned over in front of me and deliberately knocked the whole thing over
the glass smashed into a thousand pieces and the fruit rolled about into every corner of the room
you've done it now watson said he coolly
a pretty mess you've made of the carpet i stooped in some confusion and began to pick up the fruit understanding for some reason my companion desired me to take the blame upon myself
the others did the same and set the table on its legs again
halloa cried the inspector where's he got to holmes had disappeared
wait here an instant said young alec cunningham
the fellow is off his head in my opinion
come with me father and see where he has got to they rushed out of the room leaving the inspector the colonel and me staring at each other
'pon my word i am inclined to agree with master alec said the official
it may be the effect of this illness but it seems to me that his words were cut short by a sudden scream of help
help
murder with a thrill i recognised the voice of that of my friend
i rushed madly from the room on to the landing
the cries which had sunk down into a hoarse inarticulate shouting came from the room which we had first visited
i dashed in and on into the dressing room beyond
the two cunninghams were bending over the prostrate figure of sherlock holmes the younger clutching his throat with both hands while the elder seemed to be twisting one of his wrists
in an instant the three of us had torn them away from him and holmes staggered to his feet very pale and evidently greatly exhausted
arrest these men inspector he gasped
on what charge that of murdering their coachman william kirwan the inspector stared about him in bewilderment
oh come now mr
holmes said he at last i'm sure you don't really mean to tut man look at their faces cried holmes curtly
never certainly have i seen a plainer confession of guilt upon human countenances
the older man seemed numbed and dazed with a heavy sullen expression upon his strongly marked face
the son on the other hand had dropped all that jaunty dashing style which had characterized him and the ferocity of a dangerous wild beast gleamed in his dark eyes and distorted his handsome features
the inspector said nothing but stepping to the door he blew his whistle
two of his constables came at the call
i have no alternative mr
cunningham said he
i trust that this may all prove to be an absurd mistake but you can see that ah would you
drop it he struck out with his hand and a revolver which the younger man was in the act of cocking clattered down upon the floor
keep that said holmes quietly putting his foot upon it you will find it useful at the trial
but this is what we really wanted he held up a little crumpled piece of paper
the remainder of the sheet cried the inspector
precisely and where was it where i was sure it must be
i'll make the whole matter clear to you presently
i think colonel that you and watson might return now and i will be with you again in an hour at the furthest
the inspector and i must have a word with the prisoners but you will certainly see me back at luncheon time sherlock holmes was as good as his word for about one o'clock he rejoined us in the colonel's smoking room
he was accompanied by a little elderly gentleman who was introduced to me as the mr
acton whose house had been the scene of the original burglary
i wished mr
acton to be present while i demonstrated this small matter to you said holmes for it is natural that he should take a keen interest in the details
i am afraid my dear colonel that you must regret the hour that you took in such a stormy petrel as i am on the contrary answered the colonel warmly i consider it the greatest privilege to have been permitted to study your methods of working
i confess that they quite surpass my expectations and that i am utterly unable to account for your result
i have not yet seen the vestige of a clue i am afraid that my explanation may disillusionize you but it has always been my habit to hide none of my methods either from my friend watson or from any one who might take an intelligent interest in them
but first as i am rather shaken by the knocking about which i had in the dressing room i think that i shall help myself to a dash of your brandy colonel
my strength has been rather tried of late i trust that you had no more of those nervous attacks sherlock holmes laughed heartily
we will come to that in its turn said he
i will lay an account of the case before you in its due order showing you the various points which guided me in my decision
pray interrupt me if there is any inference which is not perfectly clear to you
it is of the highest importance in the art of detection to be able to recognise out of a number of facts which are incidental and which vital
otherwise your energy and attention must be dissipated instead of being concentrated
now in this case there was not the slightest doubt in my mind from the first that the key of the whole matter must be looked for in the scrap of paper in the dead man's hand
before going into this i would draw your attention to the fact that if alec cunningham's narrative was correct and if the assailant after shooting william kirwan had _instantly_ fled then it obviously could not be he who tore the paper from the dead man's hand
but if it was not he it must have been alec cunningham himself for by the time that the old man had descended several servants were upon the scene
the point is a simple one but the inspector had overlooked it because he had started with the supposition that these county magnates had had nothing to do with the matter
now i make a point of never having any prejudices and of following docilely wherever fact may lead me and so in the very first stage of the investigation i found myself looking a little askance at the part which had been played by mr
alec cunningham
and now i made a very careful examination of the corner of paper which the inspector had submitted to us
it was at once clear to me that it formed part of a very remarkable document
here it is
do you not now observe something very suggestive about it it has a very irregular look said the colonel
my dear sir cried holmes there cannot be the least doubt in the world that it has been written by two persons doing alternate words
when i draw your attention to the strong t's of 'at' and 'to' and ask you to compare them with the weak ones of 'quarter' and 'twelve ' you will instantly recognise the fact
a very brief analysis of these four words would enable you to say with the utmost confidence that the 'learn' and the 'maybe' are written in the stronger hand and the 'what' in the weaker by jove it's as clear as day cried the colonel
why on earth should two men write a letter in such a fashion obviously the business was a bad one and one of the men who distrusted the other was determined that whatever was done each should have an equal hand in it
now of the two men it is clear that the one who wrote the 'at' and 'to' was the ringleader how do you get at that we might deduce it from the mere character of the one hand as compared with the other
but we have more assured reasons than that for supposing it
if you examine this scrap with attention you will come to the conclusion that the man with the stronger hand wrote all his words first leaving blanks for the other to fill up
these blanks were not always sufficient and you can see that the second man had a squeeze to fit his 'quarter' in between the 'at' and the 'to ' showing that the latter were already written
the man who wrote all his words first is undoubtedly the man who planned the affair excellent cried mr
acton
but very superficial said holmes
we come now however to a point which is of importance
you may not be aware that the deduction of a man's age from his writing is one which has been brought to considerable accuracy by experts
in normal cases one can place a man in his true decade with tolerable confidence
i say normal cases because ill health and physical weakness reproduce the signs of old age even when the invalid is a youth
in this case looking at the bold strong hand of the one and the rather broken backed appearance of the other which still retains its legibility although the t's have begun to lose their crossing we can say that the one was a young man and the other was advanced in years without being positively decrepit excellent cried mr
acton again
there is a further point however which is subtler and of greater interest
there is something in common between these hands
they belong to men who are blood relatives
it may be most obvious to you in the greek e's but to me there are many small points which indicate the same thing
i have no doubt at all that a family mannerism can be traced in these two specimens of writing
i am only of course giving you the leading results now of my examination of the paper
there were twenty three other deductions which would be of more interest to experts than to you
they all tend to deepen the impression upon my mind that the cunninghams father and son had written this letter
having got so far my next step was of course to examine into the details of the crime and to see how far they would help us
i went up to the house with the inspector and saw all that was to be seen
the wound upon the dead man was as i was able to determine with absolute confidence fired from a revolver at the distance of something over four yards
there was no powder blackening on the clothes
evidently therefore alec cunningham had lied when he said that the two men were struggling when the shot was fired
again both father and son agreed as to the place where the man escaped into the road
at that point however as it happens there is a broadish ditch moist at the bottom
as there were no indications of bootmarks about this ditch i was absolutely sure not only that the cunninghams had again lied but that there had never been any unknown man upon the scene at all
and now i have to consider the motive of this singular crime
to get at this i endeavoured first of all to solve the reason of the original burglary at mr
acton's
i understood from something which the colonel told us that a lawsuit had been going on between you mr
acton and the cunninghams
of course it instantly occurred to me that they had broken into your library with the intention of getting at some document which might be of importance in the case precisely so said mr
acton
there can be no possible doubt as to their intentions
i have the clearest claim upon half of their present estate and if they could have found a single paper which fortunately was in the strong box of my solicitors they would undoubtedly have crippled our case there you are said holmes smiling
it was a dangerous reckless attempt in which i seem to trace the influence of young alec
having found nothing they tried to divert suspicion by making it appear to be an ordinary burglary to which end they carried off whatever they could lay their hands upon
that is all clear enough but there was much that was still obscure
what i wanted above all was to get the missing part of that note
i was certain that alec had torn it out of the dead man's hand and almost certain that he must have thrust it into the pocket of his dressing gown
where else could he have put it
the only question was whether it was still there
it was worth an effort to find out and for that object we all went up to the house
the cunninghams joined us as you doubtless remember outside the kitchen door
it was of course of the very first importance that they should not be reminded of the existence of this paper otherwise they would naturally destroy it without delay
the inspector was about to tell them the importance which we attached to it when by the luckiest chance in the world i tumbled down in a sort of fit and so changed the conversation
good heavens cried the colonel laughing do you mean to say all our sympathy was wasted and your fit an imposture speaking professionally it was admirably done cried i looking in amazement at this man who was forever confounding me with some new phase of his astuteness
it is an art which is often useful said he
when i recovered i managed by a device which had perhaps some little merit of ingenuity to get old cunningham to write the word 'twelve ' so that i might compare it with the 'twelve' upon the paper oh what an ass i have been i exclaimed
i could see that you were commiserating me over my weakness said holmes laughing
i was sorry to cause you the sympathetic pain which i know that you felt
we then went upstairs together and having entered the room and seen the dressing gown hanging up behind the door i contrived by upsetting a table to engage their attention for the moment and slipped back to examine the pockets
i had hardly got the paper however which was as i had expected in one of them when the two cunninghams were on me and would i verily believe have murdered me then and there but for your prompt and friendly aid
as it is i feel that young man's grip on my throat now and the father has twisted my wrist round in the effort to get the paper out of my hand
they saw that i must know all about it you see and the sudden change from absolute security to complete despair made them perfectly desperate
i had a little talk with old cunningham afterwards as to the motive of the crime
he was tractable enough though his son was a perfect demon ready to blow out his own or anybody else's brains if he could have got to his revolver
when cunningham saw that the case against him was so strong he lost all heart and made a clean breast of everything
it seems that william had secretly followed his two masters on the night when they made their raid upon mr
acton's and having thus got them into his power proceeded under threats of exposure to levy blackmail upon them
mr
alec however was a dangerous man to play games of that sort with
it was a stroke of positive genius on his part to see in the burglary scare which was convulsing the country side an opportunity of plausibly getting rid of the man whom he feared
william was decoyed up and shot and had they only got the whole of the note and paid a little more attention to detail in the accessories it is very possible that suspicion might never have been aroused and the note i asked
sherlock holmes placed the subjoined paper before us
piece of paper if you will only come round at quarter to twelve to the east gate you will learn what will very much surprise you and maybe be of the greatest service to you and also to annie morrison
but say nothing to anyone upon the matter it is very much the sort of thing that i expected said he
of course we do not yet know what the relations may have been between alec cunningham william kirwan and annie morrison
the results shows that the trap was skillfully baited
i am sure that you cannot fail to be delighted with the traces of heredity shown in the p's and in the tails of the g's
the absence of the i dots in the old man's writing is also most characteristic
watson i think our quiet rest in the country has been a distinct success and i shall certainly return much invigorated to baker street to morrow holmes had been seated for some hours in silence with his long thin back curved over a chemical vessel in which he was brewing a particularly malodorous product
his head was sunk upon his breast and he looked from my point of view like a strange lank bird with dull grey plumage and a black top knot
so watson said he suddenly you do not propose to invest in south african securities
i gave a start of astonishment
accustomed as i was to holmes's curious faculties this sudden intrusion into my most intimate thoughts was utterly inexplicable
how on earth do you know that
i asked
he wheeled round upon his stool with a steaming test tube in his hand and a gleam of amusement in his deep set eyes
now watson confess yourself utterly taken aback said he
i am
i ought to make you sign a paper to that effect
why
because in five minutes you will say that it is all so absurdly simple
i am sure that i shall say nothing of the kind
you see my dear watson he propped his test tube in the rack and began to lecture with the air of a professor addressing his class it is not really difficult to construct a series of inferences each dependent upon its predecessor and each simple in itself
if after doing so one simply knocks out all the central inferences and presents one's audience with the starting point and the conclusion one may produce a startling though possibly a meretricious effect
now it was not really difficult by an inspection of the groove between your left forefinger and thumb to feel sure that you did not propose to invest your small capital in the goldfields
i see no connection
very likely not but i can quickly show you a close connection
here are the missing links of the very simple chain
you had chalk between your left finger and thumb when you returned from the club last night

you put chalk there when you play billiards to steady the cue

you never play billiards except with thurston

you told me four weeks ago that thurston had an option on some south african property which would expire in a month and which he desired you to share with him

your cheque book is locked in my drawer and you have not asked for the key

you do not propose to invest your money in this manner
how absurdly simple
i cried
quite so
said he a little nettled
every problem becomes very childish when once it is explained to you
here is an unexplained one
see what you can make of that friend watson
he tossed a sheet of paper upon the table and turned once more to his chemical analysis
i looked with amazement at the absurd hieroglyphics upon the paper
why holmes it is a child's drawing i cried
oh that's your idea
what else should it be
that is what mr
hilton cubitt of riding thorpe manor norfolk is very anxious to know
this little conundrum came by the first post and he was to follow by the next train
there's a ring at the bell watson
i should not be very much surprised if this were he
a heavy step was heard upon the stairs and an instant later there entered a tall ruddy clean shaven gentleman whose clear eyes and florid cheeks told of a life led far from the fogs of baker street
he seemed to bring a whiff of his strong fresh bracing east coast air with him as he entered
having shaken hands with each of us he was about to sit down when his eye rested upon the paper with the curious markings which i had just examined and left upon the table
well mr
holmes what do you make of these
he cried
they told me that you were fond of queer mysteries and i don't think you can find a queerer one than that
i sent the paper on ahead so that you might have time to study it before i came
it is certainly rather a curious production said holmes
at first sight it would appear to be some childish prank
it consists of a number of absurd little figures dancing across the paper upon which they are drawn
why should you attribute any importance to so grotesque an object
i never should mr
holmes
but my wife does
it is frightening her to death
she says nothing but i can see terror in her eyes
that's why i want to sift the matter to the bottom
holmes held up the paper so that the sunlight shone full upon it
it was a page torn from a note book
the markings were done in pencil and ran in this way graphic holmes examined it for some time and then folding it carefully up he placed it in his pocket book
this promises to be a most interesting and unusual case said he
you gave me a few particulars in your letter mr
hilton cubitt but i should be very much obliged if you would kindly go over it all again for the benefit of my friend dr
watson
i'm not much of a story teller said our visitor nervously clasping and unclasping his great strong hands
you'll just ask me anything that i don't make clear
i'll begin at the time of my marriage last year but i want to say first of all that though i'm not a rich man my people have been at ridling thorpe for a matter of five centuries and there is no better known family in the county of norfolk
last year i came up to london for the jubilee and i stopped at a boarding house in russell square because parker the vicar of our parish was staying in it
there was an american young lady there patrick was the name elsie patrick
in some way we became friends until before my month was up i was as much in love as a man could be
we were quietly married at a registry office and we returned to norfolk a wedded couple
you'll think it very mad mr
holmes that a man of a good old family should marry a wife in this fashion knowing nothing of her past or of her people but if you saw her and knew her it would help you to understand
she was very straight about it was elsie
i can't say that she did not give me every chance of getting out of it if i wished to do so
'i have had some very disagreeable associations in my life ' said she 'i wish to forget all about them
i would rather never allude to the past for it is very painful to me
if you take me hilton you will take a woman who has nothing that she need be personally ashamed of but you will have to be content with my word for it and to allow me to be silent as to all that passed up to the time when i became yours
if these conditions are too hard then go back to norfolk and leave me to the lonely life in which you found me '
it was only the day before our wedding that she said those very words to me
i told her that i was content to take her on her own terms and i have been as good as my word
well we have been married now for a year and very happy we have been
but about a month ago at the end of june i saw for the first time signs of trouble
one day my wife received a letter from america
i saw the american stamp
she turned deadly white read the letter and threw it into the fire
she made no allusion to it afterwards and i made none for a promise is a promise but she has never known an easy hour from that moment
there is always a look of fear upon her face a look as if she were waiting and expecting
she would do better to trust me
she would find that i was her best friend
but until she speaks i can say nothing
mind you she is a truthful woman mr
holmes and whatever trouble there may have been in her past life it has been no fault of hers
i am only a simple norfolk squire but there is not a man in england who ranks his family honour more highly than i do
she knows it well and she knew it well before she married me
she would never bring any stain upon it of that i am sure
well now i come to the queer part of my story
about a week ago it was the tuesday of last week i found on one of the window sills a number of absurd little dancing figures like these upon the paper
they were scrawled with chalk
i thought that it was the stable boy who had drawn them but the lad swore he knew nothing about it
anyhow they had come there during the night
i had them washed out and i only mentioned the matter to my wife afterwards
to my surprise she took it very seriously and begged me if any more came to let her see them
none did come for a week and then yesterday morning i found this paper lying on the sun dial in the garden
i showed it to elsie and down she dropped in a dead faint
since then she has looked like a woman in a dream half dazed and with terror always lurking in her eyes
it was then that i wrote and sent the paper to you mr
holmes
it was not a thing that i could take to the police for they would have laughed at me but you will tell me what to do
i am not a rich man but if there is any danger threatening my little woman i would spend my last copper to shield her
he was a fine creature this man of the old english soil simple straight and gentle with his great earnest blue eyes and broad comely face
his love for his wife and his trust in her shone in his features
holmes had listened to his story with the utmost attention and now he sat for some time in silent thought
don't you think mr
cubitt said he at last that your best plan would be to make a direct appeal to your wife and to ask her to share her secret with you
hilton cubitt shook his massive head
a promise is a promise mr
holmes
if elsie wished to tell me she would
if not it is not for me to force her confidence
but i am justified in taking my own line and i will
then i will help you with all my heart
in the first place have you heard of any strangers being seen in your neighbourhood
no
i presume that it is a very quiet place
any fresh face would cause comment
in the immediate neighbourhood yes
but we have several small watering places not very far away
and the farmers take in lodgers
these hieroglyphics have evidently a meaning
if it is a purely arbitrary one it may be impossible for us to solve it
if on the other hand it is systematic i have no doubt that we shall get to the bottom of it
but this particular sample is so short that i can do nothing and the facts which you have brought me are so indefinite that we have no basis for an investigation
i would suggest that you return to norfolk that you keep a keen look out and that you take an exact copy of any fresh dancing men which may appear
it is a thousand pities that we have not a reproduction of those which were done in chalk upon the window sill
make a discreet inquiry also as to any strangers in the neighbourhood
when you have collected some fresh evidence come to me again
that is the best advice which i can give you mr
hilton cubitt
if there are any pressing fresh developments i shall be always ready to run down and see you in your norfolk home
the interview left sherlock holmes very thoughtful and several times in the next few days i saw him take his slip of paper from his note book and look long and earnestly at the curious figures inscribed upon it
he made no allusion to the affair however until one afternoon a fortnight or so later
i was going out when he called me back
you had better stay here watson
why
because i had a wire from hilton cubitt this morning you remember hilton cubitt of the dancing men
he was to reach liverpool street at one twenty
he may be here at any moment
i gather from his wire that there have been some new incidents of importance
we had not long to wait for our norfolk squire came straight from the station as fast as a hansom could bring him
he was looking worried and depressed with tired eyes and a lined forehead
it's getting on my nerves this business mr
holmes said he as he sank like a wearied man into an arm chair
it's bad enough to feel that you are surrounded by unseen unknown folk who have some kind of design upon you but when in addition to that you know that it is just killing your wife by inches then it becomes as much as flesh and blood can endure
she's wearing away under it just wearing away before my eyes
has she said anything yet
no mr
holmes she has not
and yet there have been times when the poor girl has wanted to speak and yet could not quite bring herself to take the plunge
i have tried to help her but i dare say i did it clumsily and scared her off from it
she has spoken about my old family and our reputation in the county and our pride in our unsullied honour and i always felt it was leading to the point but somehow it turned off before we got there
but you have found out something for yourself
a good deal mr
holmes
i have several fresh dancing men pictures for you to examine and what is more important i have seen the fellow
what the man who draws them
yes i saw him at his work
but i will tell you everything in order
when i got back after my visit to you the very first thing i saw next morning was a fresh crop of dancing men
they had been drawn in chalk upon the black wooden door of the tool house which stands beside the lawn in full view of the front windows
i took an exact copy and here it is
he unfolded a paper and laid it upon the table
here is a copy of the hieroglyphics graphic excellent
said holmes
excellent
pray continue
when i had taken the copy i rubbed out the marks but two mornings later a fresh inscription had appeared
i have a copy of it here graphic holmes rubbed his hands and chuckled with delight
our material is rapidly accumulating said he
three days later a message was left scrawled upon paper and placed under a pebble upon the sun dial
here it is
the characters are as you see exactly the same as the last one
after that i determined to lie in wait so i got out my revolver and i sat up in my study which overlooks the lawn and garden
about two in the morning i was seated by the window all being dark save for the moonlight outside when i heard steps behind me and there was my wife in her dressing gown
she implored me to come to bed
i told her frankly that i wished to see who it was who played such absurd tricks upon us
she answered that it was some senseless practical joke and that i should not take any notice of it
'if it really annoys you hilton we might go and travel you and i and so avoid this nuisance '
'what be driven out of our own house by a practical joker '
said i
'why we should have the whole county laughing at us '
'well come to bed ' said she 'and we can discuss it in the morning '
suddenly as she spoke i saw her white face grow whiter yet in the moonlight and her hand tightened upon my shoulder
something was moving in the shadow of the tool house
i saw a dark creeping figure which crawled round the corner and squatted in front of the door
seizing my pistol i was rushing out when my wife threw her arms round me and held me with convulsive strength
i tried to throw her off but she clung to me most desperately
at last i got clear but by the time i had opened the door and reached the house the creature was gone
he had left a trace of his presence however for there on the door was the very same arrangement of dancing men which had already twice appeared and which i have copied on that paper
there was no other sign of the fellow anywhere though i ran all over the grounds
and yet the amazing thing is that he must have been there all the time for when i examined the door again in the morning he had scrawled some more of his pictures under the line which i had already seen
have you that fresh drawing
yes it is very short but i made a copy of it and here it is
again he produced a paper
the new dance was in this form graphic tell me said holmes and i could see by his eyes that he was much excited was this a mere addition to the first or did it appear to be entirely separate
it was on a different panel of the door
excellent
this is far the most important of all for our purpose
it fills me with hopes
now mr
hilton cubitt please continue your most interesting statement
i have nothing more to say mr
holmes except that i was angry with my wife that night for having held me back when i might have caught the skulking rascal
she said that she feared that i might come to harm
for an instant it had crossed my mind that perhaps what she really feared was that he might come to harm for i could not doubt that she knew who this man was and what he meant by these strange signals
but there is a tone in my wife's voice mr
holmes and a look in her eyes which forbid doubt and i am sure that it was indeed my own safety that was in her mind
there's the whole case and now i want your advice as to what i ought to do
my own inclination is to put half a dozen of my farm lads in the shrubbery and when this fellow comes again to give him such a hiding that he will leave us in peace for the future
i fear it is too deep a case for such simple remedies said holmes
how long can you stay in london
i must go back to day
i would not leave my wife alone all night for anything
she is very nervous and begged me to come back
i dare say you are right
but if you could have stopped i might possibly have been able to return with you in a day or two
meanwhile you will leave me these papers and i think that it is very likely that i shall be able to pay you a visit shortly and to throw some light upon your case
sherlock holmes preserved his calm professional manner until our visitor had left us although it was easy for me who knew him so well to see that he was profoundly excited
the moment that hilton cubitt's broad back had disappeared through the door my comrade rushed to the table laid out all the slips of paper containing dancing men in front of him and threw himself into an intricate and elaborate calculation
for two hours i watched him as he covered sheet after sheet of paper with figures and letters so completely absorbed in his task that he had evidently forgotten my presence
sometimes he was making progress and whistled and sang at his work sometimes he was puzzled and would sit for long spells with a furrowed brow and a vacant eye
finally he sprang from his chair with a cry of satisfaction and walked up and down the room rubbing his hands together
then he wrote a long telegram upon a cable form
if my answer to this is as i hope you will have a very pretty case to add to your collection watson said he
i expect that we shall be able to go down to norfolk to morrow and to take our friend some very definite news as to the secret of his annoyance
i confess that i was filled with curiosity but i was aware that holmes liked to make his disclosures at his own time and in his own way so i waited until it should suit him to take me into his confidence
but there was a delay in that answering telegram and two days of impatience followed during which holmes pricked up his ears at every ring of the bell
on the evening of the second there came a letter from hilton cubitt
all was quiet with him save that a long inscription had appeared that morning upon the pedestal of the sun dial
he inclosed a copy of it which is here reproduced graphic holmes bent over this grotesque frieze for some minutes and then suddenly sprang to his feet with an exclamation of surprise and dismay
his face was haggard with anxiety
we have let this affair go far enough said he
is there a train to north walsham to night
i turned up the time table
the last had just gone
then we shall breakfast early and take the very first in the morning said holmes
our presence is most urgently needed
ah
here is our expected cablegram
one moment mrs
hudson there may be an answer
no that is quite as i expected
this message makes it even more essential that we should not lose an hour in letting hilton cubitt know how matters stand for it is a singular and a dangerous web in which our simple norfolk squire is entangled
so indeed it proved and as i come to the dark conclusion of a story which had seemed to me to be only childish and bizarre i experience once again the dismay and horror with which i was filled
would that i had some brighter ending to communicate to my readers but these are the chronicles of fact and i must follow to their dark crisis the strange chain of events which for some days made ridling thorpe manor a household word through the length and breadth of england
we had hardly alighted at north walsham and mentioned the name of our destination when the station master hurried towards us
i suppose that you are the detectives from london
said he
a look of annoyance passed over holmes's face
what makes you think such a thing
because inspector martin from norwich has just passed through
but maybe you are the surgeons
she's not dead or wasn't by last accounts
you may be in time to save her yet though it be for the gallows
holmes's brow was dark with anxiety
we are going to ridling thorpe manor said he but we have heard nothing of what has passed there
it's a terrible business said the station master
they are shot both mr
hilton cubitt and his wife
she shot him and then herself so the servants say
he's dead and her life is despaired of
dear dear one of the oldest families in the county of norfolk and one of the most honoured
without a word holmes hurried to a carriage and during the long seven miles' drive he never opened his mouth
seldom have i seen him so utterly despondent
he had been uneasy during all our journey from town and i had observed that he had turned over the morning papers with anxious attention but now this sudden realization of his worst fears left him in a blank melancholy
he leaned back in his seat lost in gloomy speculation
yet there was much around to interest us for we were passing through as singular a country side as any in england where a few scattered cottages represented the population of to day while on every hand enormous square towered churches bristled up from the flat green landscape and told of the glory and prosperity of old east anglia
at last the violet rim of the german ocean appeared over the green edge of the norfolk coast and the driver pointed with his whip to two old brick and timber gables which projected from a grove of trees
that's ridling thorpe manor said he
as we drove up to the porticoed front door i observed in front of it beside the tennis lawn the black tool house and the pedestalled sun dial with which we had such strange associations
a dapper little man with a quick alert manner and a waxed moustache had just descended from a high dog cart
he introduced himself as inspector martin of the norfolk constabulary and he was considerably astonished when he heard the name of my companion
why mr
holmes the crime was only committed at three this morning
how could you hear of it in london and get to the spot as soon as i
i anticipated it
i came in the hope of preventing it
then you must have important evidence of which we are ignorant for they were said to be a most united couple
i have only the evidence of the dancing men said holmes
i will explain the matter to you later
meanwhile since it is too late to prevent this tragedy i am very anxious that i should use the knowledge which i possess in order to ensure that justice be done
will you associate me in your investigation or will you prefer that i should act independently
i should be proud to feel that we were acting together mr
holmes said the inspector earnestly
in that case i should be glad to hear the evidence and to examine the premises without an instant of unnecessary delay
inspector martin had the good sense to allow my friend to do things in his own fashion and contented himself with carefully noting the results
the local surgeon an old white haired man had just come down from mrs
hilton cubitt's room and he reported that her injuries were serious but not necessarily fatal
the bullet had passed through the front of her brain and it would probably be some time before she could regain consciousness
on the question of whether she had been shot or had shot herself he would not venture to express any decided opinion
certainly the bullet had been discharged at very close quarters
there was only the one pistol found in the room two barrels of which had been emptied
mr
hilton cubitt had been shot through the heart
it was equally conceivable that he had shot her and then himself or that she had been the criminal for the revolver lay upon the floor midway between them
has he been moved
asked holmes
we have moved nothing except the lady
we could not leave her lying wounded upon the floor
how long have you been here doctor
since four o'clock
anyone else
yes the constable here
and you have touched nothing
nothing
you have acted with great discretion
who sent for you
the housemaid saunders
was it she who gave the alarm
she and mrs
king the cook
where are they now
in the kitchen i believe
then i think we had better hear their story at once
the old hall oak panelled and high windowed had been turned into a court of investigation
holmes sat in a great old fashioned chair his inexorable eyes gleaming out of his haggard face
i could read in them a set purpose to devote his life to this quest until the client whom he had failed to save should at last be avenged
the trim inspector martin the old grey headed country doctor myself and a stolid village policeman made up the rest of that strange company
the two women told their story clearly enough
they had been aroused from their sleep by the sound of an explosion which had been followed a minute later by a second one
they slept in adjoining rooms and mrs
king had rushed in to saunders
together they had descended the stairs
the door of the study was open and a candle was burning upon the table
their master lay upon his face in the centre of the room
he was quite dead
near the window his wife was crouching her head leaning against the wall
she was horribly wounded and the side of her face was red with blood
she breathed heavily but was incapable of saying anything
the passage as well as the room was full of smoke and the smell of powder
the window was certainly shut and fastened upon the inside
both women were positive upon the point
they had at once sent for the doctor and for the constable
then with the aid of the groom and the stable boy they had conveyed their injured mistress to her room
both she and her husband had occupied the bed
she was clad in her dress he in his dressing gown over his night clothes
nothing had been moved in the study
so far as they knew there had never been any quarrel between husband and wife
they had always looked upon them as a very united couple
these were the main points of the servants' evidence
in answer to inspector martin they were clear that every door was fastened upon the inside and that no one could have escaped from the house
in answer to holmes they both remembered that they were conscious of the smell of powder from the moment that they ran out of their rooms upon the top floor
i commend that fact very carefully to your attention said holmes to his professional colleague
and now i think that we are in a position to undertake a thorough examination of the room
the study proved to be a small chamber lined on three sides with books and with a writing table facing an ordinary window which looked out upon the garden
our first attention was given to the body of the unfortunate squire whose huge frame lay stretched across the room
his disordered dress showed that he had been hastily aroused from sleep
the bullet had been fired at him from the front and had remained in his body after penetrating the heart
his death had certainly been instantaneous and painless
there was no powder marking either upon his dressing gown or on his hands
according to the country surgeon the lady had stains upon her face but none upon her hand
the absence of the latter means nothing though its presence may mean everything said holmes
unless the powder from a badly fitting cartridge happens to spurt backwards one may fire many shots without leaving a sign
i would suggest that mr
cubitt's body may now be removed
i suppose doctor you have not recovered the bullet which wounded the lady
a serious operation will be necessary before that can be done
but there are still four cartridges in the revolver
two have been fired and two wounds inflicted so that each bullet can be accounted for
so it would seem said holmes
perhaps you can account also for the bullet which has so obviously struck the edge of the window
he had turned suddenly and his long thin finger was pointing to a hole which had been drilled right through the lower window sash about an inch above the bottom
by george
cried the inspector
how ever did you see that
because i looked for it
wonderful
said the country doctor
you are certainly right sir
then a third shot has been fired and therefore a third person must have been present
but who could that have been and how could he have got away
that is the problem which we are now about to solve said sherlock holmes
you remember inspector martin when the servants said that on leaving their room they were at once conscious of a smell of powder i remarked that the point was an extremely important one
yes sir but i confess i did not quite follow you
it suggested that at the time of the firing the window as well as the door of the room had been open
otherwise the fumes of powder could not have been blown so rapidly through the house
a draught in the room was necessary for that
both door and window were only open for a very short time however
how do you prove that
because the candle has not guttered
capital
cried the inspector
capital
feeling sure that the window had been open at the time of the tragedy i conceived that there might have been a third person in the affair who stood outside this opening and fired through it
any shot directed at this person might hit the sash
i looked and there sure enough was the bullet mark
but how came the window to be shut and fastened
the woman's first instinct would be to shut and fasten the window
but halloa
what is this
it was a lady's hand bag which stood upon the study table a trim little hand bag of crocodile skin and silver
holmes opened it and turned the contents out
there were twenty fifty pound notes of the bank of england held together by an india rubber band nothing else
this must be preserved for it will figure in the trial said holmes as he handed the bag with its contents to the inspector
it is now necessary that we should try to throw some light upon this third bullet which has clearly from the splintering of the wood been fired from inside the room
i should like to see mrs
king the cook again
you said mrs
king that you were awakened by a loud explosion
when you said that did you mean that it seemed to you to be louder than the second one
well sir it wakened me from my sleep and so it is hard to judge
but it did seem very loud
you don't think that it might have been two shots fired almost at the same instant
i am sure i couldn't say sir
i believe that it was undoubtedly so
i rather think inspector martin that we have now exhausted all that this room can teach us
if you will kindly step round with me we shall see what fresh evidence the garden has to offer
a flower bed extended up to the study window and we all broke into an exclamation as we approached it
the flowers were trampled down and the soft soil was imprinted all over with footmarks
large masculine feet they were with peculiarly long sharp toes
holmes hunted about among the grass and leaves like a retriever after a wounded bird
then with a cry of satisfaction he bent forward and picked up a little brazen cylinder
i thought so said he the revolver had an ejector and here is the third cartridge
i really think inspector martin that our case is almost complete
the country inspector's face had shown his intense amazement at the rapid and masterful progress of holmes's investigation
at first he had shown some disposition to assert his own position but now he was overcome with admiration and ready to follow without question wherever holmes led
whom do you suspect
he asked
i'll go into that later
there are several points in this problem which i have not been able to explain to you yet
now that i have got so far i had best proceed on my own lines and then clear the whole matter up once and for all
just as you wish mr
holmes so long as we get our man
i have no desire to make mysteries but it is impossible at the moment of action to enter into long and complex explanations
i have the threads of this affair all in my hand
even if this lady should never recover consciousness we can still reconstruct the events of last night and ensure that justice be done
first of all i wish to know whether there is any inn in this neighbourhood known as 'elrige's'
the servants were cross questioned but none of them had heard of such a place
the stable boy threw a light upon the matter by remembering that a farmer of that name lived some miles off in the direction of east ruston
is it a lonely farm
very lonely sir
perhaps they have not heard yet of all that happened here during the night
maybe not sir
holmes thought for a little and then a curious smile played over his face
saddle a horse my lad said he
i shall wish you to take a note to elrige's farm
he took from his pocket the various slips of the dancing men
with these in front of him he worked for some time at the study table
finally he handed a note to the boy with directions to put it into the hands of the person to whom it was addressed and especially to answer no questions of any sort which might be put to him
i saw the outside of the note addressed in straggling irregular characters very unlike holmes's usual precise hand
it was consigned to mr
abe slaney elrige's farm east ruston norfolk
i think inspector holmes remarked that you would do well to telegraph for an escort as if my calculations prove to be correct you may have a particularly dangerous prisoner to convey to the county gaol
the boy who takes this note could no doubt forward your telegram
if there is an afternoon train to town watson i think we should do well to take it as i have a chemical analysis of some interest to finish and this investigation draws rapidly to a close
when the youth had been dispatched with the note sherlock holmes gave his instructions to the servants
if any visitor were to call asking for mrs
hilton cubitt no information should be given as to her condition but he was to be shown at once into the drawing room
he impressed these points upon them with the utmost earnestness
finally he led the way into the drawing room with the remark that the business was now out of our hands and that we must while away the time as best we might until we could see what was in store for us
the doctor had departed to his patients and only the inspector and myself remained
i think that i can help you to pass an hour in an interesting and profitable manner said holmes drawing his chair up to the table and spreading out in front of him the various papers upon which were recorded the antics of the dancing men
as to you friend watson i owe you every atonement for having allowed your natural curiosity to remain so long unsatisfied
to you inspector the whole incident may appeal as a remarkable professional study
i must tell you first of all the interesting circumstances connected with the previous consultations which mr
hilton cubitt has had with me in baker street
he then shortly recapitulated the facts which have already been recorded
i have here in front of me these singular productions at which one might smile had they not proved themselves to be the fore runners of so terrible a tragedy
i am fairly familiar with all forms of secret writings and am myself the author of a trifling monograph upon the subject in which i analyze one hundred and sixty separate ciphers but i confess that this is entirely new to me
the object of those who invented the system has apparently been to conceal that these characters convey a message and to give the idea that they are the mere random sketches of children
having once recognised however that the symbols stood for letters and having applied the rules which guide us in all forms of secret writings the solution was easy enough
the first message submitted to me was so short that it was impossible for me to do more than to say with some confidence that the symbol xxx stood for e as you are aware e is the most common letter in the english alphabet and it predominates to so marked an extent that even in a short sentence one would expect to find it most often
out of fifteen symbols in the first message four were the same so it was reasonable to set this down as e it is true that in some cases the figure was bearing a flag and in some cases not but it was probable from the way in which the flags were distributed that they were used to break the sentence up into words
i accepted this as a hypothesis and noted that e was represented by xxx
but now came the real difficulty of the inquiry
the order of the english letters after e is by no means well marked and any preponderance which may be shown in an average of a printed sheet may be reversed in a single short sentence
speaking roughly t a o i n s h r d and l are the numerical order in which letters occur but t a o and i are very nearly abreast of each other and it would be an endless task to try each combination until a meaning was arrived at
i therefore waited for fresh material
in my second interview with mr
hilton cubitt he was able to give me two other short sentences and one message which appeared since there was no flag to be a single word
here are the symbols
now in the single word i have already got the two e's coming second and fourth in a word of five letters
it might be 'sever ' or 'lever ' or 'never '
there can be no question that the latter as a reply to an appeal is far the most probable and the circumstances pointed to its being a reply written by the lady
accepting it as correct we are now able to say that the symbols xxx stand respectively for n v and r
even now i was in considerable difficulty but a happy thought put me in possession of several other letters
it occurred to me that if these appeals came as i expected from someone who had been intimate with the lady in her early life a combination which contained two e's with three letters between might very well stand for the name 'elsie '
on examination i found that such a combination formed the termination of the message which was three times repeated
it was certainly some appeal to 'elsie '
in this way i had got my l s and i but what appeal could it be
there were only four letters in the word which preceded 'elsie ' and it ended in e surely the word must be 'come '
i tried all other four letters ending in e but could find none to fit the case
so now i was in possession of c o and m and i was in a position to attack the first message once more dividing it into words and putting dots for each symbol which was still unknown
so treated it worked out in this fashion m ere e sl ne
now the first letter can only be a which is a most useful discovery since it occurs no fewer than three times in this short sentence and the h is also apparent in the second word
now it becomes am here a e slane
or filling in the obvious vacancies in the name am here abe slaney
i had so many letters now that i could proceed with considerable confidence to the second message which worked out in this fashion a elri es
here i could only make sense by putting t and g for the missing letters and supposing that the name was that of some house or inn at which the writer was staying
inspector martin and i had listened with the utmost interest to the full and clear account of how my friend had produced results which had led to so complete a command over our difficulties
what did you do then sir
asked the inspector
i had every reason to suppose that this abe slaney was an american since abe is an american contraction and since a letter from america had been the starting point of all the trouble
i had also every cause to think that there was some criminal secret in the matter
the lady's allusions to her past and her refusal to take her husband into her confidence both pointed in that direction
i therefore cabled to my friend wilson hargreave of the new york police bureau who has more than once made use of my knowledge of london crime
i asked him whether the name of abe slaney was known to him
here is his reply 'the most dangerous crook in chicago '
on the very evening upon which i had his answer hilton cubitt sent me the last message from slaney
working with known letters it took this form elsie re are to meet thy go
the addition of a p and a d completed a message which showed me that the rascal was proceeding from persuasion to threats and my knowledge of the crooks of chicago prepared me to find that he might very rapidly put his words into action
i at once came to norfolk with my friend and colleague dr
watson but unhappily only in time to find that the worst had already occurred
it is a privilege to be associated with you in the handling of a case said the inspector warmly
you will excuse me however if i speak frankly to you
you are only answerable to yourself but i have to answer to my superiors
if this abe slaney living at elrige's is indeed the murderer and if he has made his escape while i am seated here i should certainly get into serious trouble
you need not be uneasy
he will not try to escape
how do you know
to fly would be a confession of guilt
then let us go to arrest him
i expect him here every instant
but why should he come
because i have written and asked him
but this is incredible mr
holmes
why should he come because you have asked him
would not such a request rather rouse his suspicions and cause him to fly
i think i have known how to frame the letter said sherlock holmes
in fact if i am not very much mistaken here is the gentleman himself coming up the drive
a man was striding up the path which led to the door
he was a tall handsome swarthy fellow clad in a suit of grey flannel with a panama hat a bristling black beard and a great aggressive hooked nose and flourishing a cane as he walked
he swaggered up the path as if the place belonged to him and we heard his loud confident peal at the bell
i think gentlemen said holmes quietly that we had best take up our position behind the door
every precaution is necessary when dealing with such a fellow
you will need your handcuffs inspector
you can leave the talking to me
we waited in silence for a minute one of those minutes which one can never forget
then the door opened and the man stepped in
in an instant holmes clapped a pistol to his head and martin slipped the handcuffs over his wrists
it was all done so swiftly and deftly that the fellow was helpless before he knew that he was attacked
he glared from one to the other of us with a pair of blazing black eyes
then he burst into a bitter laugh
well gentlemen you have the drop on me this time
i seem to have knocked up against something hard
but i came here in answer to a letter from mrs
hilton cubitt
don't tell me that she is in this
don't tell me that she helped to set a trap for me
mrs
hilton cubitt was seriously injured and is at death's door
the man gave a hoarse cry of grief which rang through the house
you're crazy
he cried fiercely
it was he that was hurt not she
who would have hurt little elsie
i may have threatened her god forgive me but i would not have touched a hair of her pretty head
take it back you
say that she is not hurt
she was found badly wounded by the side of her dead husband
he sank with a deep groan on to the settee and buried his face in his manacled hands
for five minutes he was silent
then he raised his face once more and spoke with the cold composure of despair
i have nothing to hide from you gentlemen said he
if i shot the man he had his shot at me and there's no murder in that
but if you think i could have hurt that woman then you don't know either me or her
i tell you there was never a man in this world loved a woman more than i loved her
i had a right to her
she was pledged to me years ago
who was this englishman that he should come between us
i tell you that i had the first right to her and that i was only claiming my own
she broke away from your influence when she found the man that you are said holmes sternly
she fled from america to avoid you and she married an honourable gentleman in england
you dogged her and followed her and made her life a misery to her in order to induce her to abandon the husband whom she loved and respected in order to fly with you whom she feared and hated
you have ended by bringing about the death of a noble man and driving his wife to suicide
that is your record in this business mr
abe slaney and you will answer for it to the law
if elsie dies i care nothing what becomes of me said the american
he opened one of his hands and looked at a note crumpled up in his palm
see here mister he cried with a gleam of suspicion in his eyes you're not trying to scare me over this are you
if the lady is hurt as bad as you say who was it that wrote this note
he tossed it forwards on to the table
i wrote it to bring you here
you wrote it
there was no one on earth outside the joint who knew the secret of the dancing men
how came you to write it
what one man can invent another can discover said holmes
there is a cab coming to convey you to norwich mr
slaney
but meanwhile you have time to make some small reparation for the injury you have wrought
are you aware that mrs
hilton cubitt has herself lain under grave suspicion of the murder of her husband and that it was only my presence here and the knowledge which i happened to possess which has saved her from the accusation
the least that you owe her is to make it clear to the whole world that she was in no way directly or indirectly responsible for his tragic end
i ask nothing better said the american
i guess the very best case i can make for myself is the absolute naked truth
it is my duty to warn you that it will be used against you cried the inspector with the magnificent fair play of the british criminal law
slaney shrugged his shoulders
i'll chance that said he
first of all i want you gentlemen to understand that i have known this lady since she was a child
there were seven of us in a gang in chicago and elsie's father was the boss of the joint
he was a clever man was old patrick
it was he who invented that writing which would pass as a child's scrawl unless you just happened to have the key to it
well elsie learned some of our ways but she couldn't stand the business and she had a bit of honest money of her own so she gave us all the slip and got away to london
she had been engaged to me and she would have married me i believe if i had taken over another profession but she would have nothing to do with anything on the cross
it was only after her marriage to this englishman that i was able to find out where she was
i wrote to her but got no answer
after that i came over and as letters were no use i put my messages where she could read them
well i have been here a month now
i lived in that farm where i had a room down below and could get in and out every night and no one the wiser
i tried all i could to coax elsie away
i knew that she read the messages for once she wrote an answer under one of them
then my temper got the better of me and i began to threaten her
she sent me a letter then imploring me to go away and saying that it would break her heart if any scandal should come upon her husband
she said that she would come down when her husband was asleep at three in the morning and speak with me through the end window if i would go away afterwards and leave her in peace
she came down and brought money with her trying to bribe me to go
this made me mad and i caught her arm and tried to pull her through the window
at that moment in rushed the husband with his revolver in his hand
elsie had sunk down upon the floor and we were face to face
i was heeled also and i held up my gun to scare him off and let me get away
he fired and missed me
i pulled off almost at the same instant and down he dropped
i made away across the garden and as i went i heard the window shut behind me
that's god's truth gentlemen every word of it and i heard no more about it until that lad came riding up with a note which made me walk in here like a jay and give myself into your hands
a cab had driven up whilst the american had been talking
two uniformed policemen sat inside
inspector martin rose and touched his prisoner on the shoulder
it is time for us to go
can i see her first
no she is not conscious
mr
sherlock holmes i only hope that if ever again i have an important case i shall have the good fortune to have you by my side
we stood at the window and watched the cab drive away
as i turned back my eye caught the pellet of paper which the prisoner had tossed upon the table
it was the note with which holmes had decoyed him
see if you can read it watson said he with a smile
it contained no word but this little line of dancing men graphic if you use the code which i have explained said holmes you will find that it simply means 'come here at once '
i was convinced that it was an invitation which he would not refuse since he could never imagine that it could come from anyone but the lady
and so my dear watson we have ended by turning the dancing men to good when they have so often been the agents of evil and i think that i have fulfilled my promise of giving you something unusual for your note book
three forty is our train and i fancy we should be back in baker street for dinner
only one word of epilogue
the american abe slaney was condemned to death at the winter assizes at norwich but his penalty was changed to penal servitude in consideration of mitigating circumstances and the certainty that hilton cubitt had fired the first shot
of mrs
hilton cubitt i only know that i have heard she recovered entirely and that she still remains a widow devoting her whole life to the care of the poor and to the administration of her husband's estate
i had intended the adventure of the abbey grange to be the last of those exploits of my friend mr
sherlock holmes which i should ever communicate to the public
this resolution of mine was not due to any lack of material since i have notes of many hundreds of cases to which i have never alluded nor was it caused by any waning interest on the part of my readers in the singular personality and unique methods of this remarkable man
the real reason lay in the reluctance which mr
holmes has shown to the continued publication of his experiences
so long as he was in actual professional practice the records of his successes were of some practical value to him but since he has definitely retired from london and betaken himself to study and bee farming on the sussex downs notoriety has become hateful to him and he has peremptorily requested that his wishes in this matter should be strictly observed
it was only upon my representing to him that i had given a promise that the adventure of the second stain should be published when the times were ripe and pointing out to him that it is only appropriate that this long series of episodes should culminate in the most important international case which he has ever been called upon to handle that i at last succeeded in obtaining his consent that a carefully guarded account of the incident should at last be laid before the public
if in telling the story i seem to be somewhat vague in certain details the public will readily understand that there is an excellent reason for my reticence
it was then in a year and even in a decade that shall be nameless that upon one tuesday morning in autumn we found two visitors of european fame within the walls of our humble room in baker street
the one austere high nosed eagle eyed and dominant was none other than the illustrious lord bellinger twice premier of britain
the other dark clear cut and elegant hardly yet of middle age and endowed with every beauty of body and of mind was the right honourable trelawney hope secretary for european affairs and the most rising statesman in the country
they sat side by side upon our paper littered settee and it was easy to see from their worn and anxious faces that it was business of the most pressing importance which had brought them
the premier's thin blue veined hands were clasped tightly over the ivory head of his umbrella and his gaunt ascetic face looked gloomily from holmes to me
the european secretary pulled nervously at his moustache and fidgeted with the seals of his watch chain
when i discovered my loss mr
holmes which was at eight o'clock this morning i at once informed the prime minister
it was at his suggestion that we have both come to you
have you informed the police
no sir said the prime minister with the quick decisive manner for which he was famous
we have not done so nor is it possible that we should do so
to inform the police must in the long run mean to inform the public
this is what we particularly desire to avoid
and why sir
because the document in question is of such immense importance that its publication might very easily i might almost say probably lead to european complications of the utmost moment
it is not too much to say that peace or war may hang upon the issue
unless its recovery can be attended with the utmost secrecy then it may as well not be recovered at all for all that is aimed at by those who have taken it is that its contents should be generally known
i understand
now mr
trelawney hope i should be much obliged if you would tell me exactly the circumstances under which this document disappeared
that can be done in a very few words mr
holmes
the letter for it was a letter from a foreign potentate was received six days ago
it was of such importance that i have never left it in my safe but i have taken it across each evening to my house in whitehall terrace and kept it in my bedroom in a locked despatch box
it was there last night
of that i am certain
i actually opened the box while i was dressing for dinner and saw the document inside
this morning it was gone
the despatch box had stood beside the glass upon my dressing table all night
i am a light sleeper and so is my wife
we are both prepared to swear that no one could have entered the room during the night
and yet i repeat that the paper is gone
what time did you dine
half past seven
how long was it before you went to bed
my wife had gone to the theatre
i waited up for her
it was half past eleven before we went to our room
then for four hours the despatch box had lain unguarded
no one is ever permitted to enter that room save the housemaid in the morning and my valet or my wife's maid during the rest of the day
they are both trusty servants who have been with us for some time
besides neither of them could possibly have known that there was anything more valuable than the ordinary departmental papers in my despatch box
who did know of the existence of that letter
no one in the house
surely your wife knew
no sir i had said nothing to my wife until i missed the paper this morning
the premier nodded approvingly
i have long known sir how high is your sense of public duty said he
i am convinced that in the case of a secret of this importance it would rise superior to the most intimate domestic ties
the european secretary bowed
you do me no more than justice sir
until this morning i have never breathed one word to my wife upon this matter
could she have guessed
no mr
holmes she could not have guessed nor could anyone have guessed
have you lost any documents before
no sir
who is there in england who did know of the existence of this letter
each member of the cabinet was informed of it yesterday but the pledge of secrecy which attends every cabinet meeting was increased by the solemn warning which was given by the prime minister
good heavens to think that within a few hours i should myself have lost it
his handsome face was distorted with a spasm of despair and his hands tore at his hair
for a moment we caught a glimpse of the natural man impulsive ardent keenly sensitive
the next the aristocratic mask was replaced and the gentle voice had returned
besides the members of the cabinet there are two or possibly three departmental officials who know of the letter
no one else in england mr
holmes i assure you
but abroad
i believe that no one abroad has seen it save the man who wrote it
i am well convinced that his ministers that the usual official channels have not been employed
holmes considered for some little time
now sir i must ask you more particularly what this document is and why its disappearance should have such momentous consequences
the two statesmen exchanged a quick glance and the premier's shaggy eyebrows gathered in a frown
mr
holmes the envelope is a long thin one of pale blue colour
there is a seal of red wax stamped with a crouching lion
it is addressed in large bold handwriting to i fear sir said holmes that interesting and indeed essential as these details are my inquiries must go more to the root of things
what was the letter
that is a state secret of the utmost importance and i fear that i cannot tell you nor do i see that it is necessary
if by the aid of the powers which you are said to possess you can find such an envelope as i describe with its enclosure you will have deserved well of your country and earned any reward which it lies in our power to bestow
sherlock holmes rose with a smile
you are two of the most busy men in the country said he and in my own small way i have also a good many calls upon me
i regret exceedingly that i cannot help you in this matter and any continuation of this interview would be a waste of time
the premier sprang to his feet with that quick fierce gleam of his deep set eyes before which a cabinet has cowered
i am not accustomed sir he began but mastered his anger and resumed his seat
for a minute or more we all sat in silence
then the old statesman shrugged his shoulders
we must accept your terms mr
holmes
no doubt you are right and it is unreasonable for us to expect you to act unless we give you our entire confidence
i agree with you sir said the younger statesman
then i will tell you relying entirely upon your honour and that of your colleague dr
watson
i may appeal to your patriotism also for i could not imagine a greater misfortune for the country than that this affair should come out
you may safely trust us
the letter then is from a certain foreign potentate who has been ruffled by some recent colonial developments of this country
it has been written hurriedly and upon his own responsibility entirely
inquiries have shown that his ministers know nothing of the matter
at the same time it is couched in so unfortunate a manner and certain phrases in it are of so provocative a character that its publication would undoubtedly lead to a most dangerous state of feeling in this country
there would be such a ferment sir that i do not hesitate to say that within a week of the publication of that letter this country would be involved in a great war
holmes wrote a name upon a slip of paper and handed it to the premier
exactly
it was he
and it is this letter this letter which may well mean the expenditure of a thousand millions and the lives of a hundred thousand men which has become lost in this unaccountable fashion
have you informed the sender
yes sir a cipher telegram has been despatched
perhaps he desires the publication of the letter
no sir we have strong reason to believe that he already understands that he has acted in an indiscreet and hot headed manner
it would be a greater blow to him and to his country than to us if this letter were to come out
if this is so whose interest is it that the letter should come out
why should anyone desire to steal it or to publish it
there mr
holmes you take me into regions of high international politics
but if you consider the european situation you will have no difficulty in perceiving the motive
the whole of europe is an armed camp
there is a double league which makes a fair balance of military power
great britain holds the scales
if britain were driven into war with one confederacy it would assure the supremacy of the other confederacy whether they joined in the war or not
do you follow
very clearly
it is then the interest of the enemies of this potentate to secure and publish this letter so as to make a breach between his country and ours
yes sir
and to whom would this document be sent if it fell into the hands of an enemy
to any of the great chancelleries of europe
it is probably speeding on its way thither at the present instant as fast as steam can take it
mr
trelawney hope dropped his head on his chest and groaned aloud
the premier placed his hand kindly upon his shoulder
it is your misfortune my dear fellow
no one can blame you
there is no precaution which you have neglected
now mr
holmes you are in full possession of the facts
what course do you recommend
holmes shook his head mournfully
you think sir that unless this document is recovered there will be war
i think it is very probable
then sir prepare for war
that is a hard saying mr
holmes
consider the facts sir
it is inconceivable that it was taken after eleven thirty at night since i understand that mr
hope and his wife were both in the room from that hour until the loss was found out
it was taken then yesterday evening between seven thirty and eleven thirty probably near the earlier hour since whoever took it evidently knew that it was there and would naturally secure it as early as possible
now sir if a document of this importance were taken at that hour where can it be now
no one has any reason to retain it
it has been passed rapidly on to those who need it
what chance have we now to overtake or even to trace it
it is beyond our reach
the prime minister rose from the settee
what you say is perfectly logical mr
holmes
i feel that the matter is indeed out of our hands
let us presume for argument's sake that the document was taken by the maid or by the valet they are both old and tried servants
i understand you to say that your room is on the second floor that there is no entrance from without and that from within no one could go up unobserved
it must then be somebody in the house who has taken it
to whom would the thief take it
to one of several international spies and secret agents whose names are tolerably familiar to me
there are three who may be said to be the heads of their profession
i will begin my research by going round and finding if each of them is at his post
if one is missing especially if he has disappeared since last night we will have some indication as to where the document has gone
why should he be missing
asked the european secretary
he would take the letter to an embassy in london as likely as not
i fancy not
these agents work independently and their relations with the embassies are often strained
the prime minister nodded his acquiescence
i believe you are right mr
holmes
he would take so valuable a prize to head quarters with his own hands
i think that your course of action is an excellent one
meanwhile hope we cannot neglect all our other duties on account of this one misfortune
should there be any fresh developments during the day we shall communicate with you and you will no doubt let us know the results of your own inquiries
the two statesmen bowed and walked gravely from the room
when our illustrious visitors had departed holmes lit his pipe in silence and sat for some time lost in the deepest thought
i had opened the morning paper and was immersed in a sensational crime which had occurred in london the night before when my friend gave an exclamation sprang to his feet and laid his pipe down upon the mantelpiece
yes said he there is no better way of approaching it
the situation is desperate but not hopeless
even now if we could be sure which of them has taken it it is just possible that it has not yet passed out of his hands
after all it is a question of money with these fellows and i have the british treasury behind me
if it's on the market i'll buy it if it means another penny on the income tax
it is conceivable that the fellow might hold it back to see what bids come from this side before he tries his luck on the other
there are only those three capable of playing so bold a game there are oberstein la rothiere and eduardo lucas
i will see each of them
i glanced at my morning paper
is that eduardo lucas of godolphin street
yes
you will not see him
why not
he was murdered in his house last night
my friend has so often astonished me in the course of our adventures that it was with a sense of exultation that i realized how completely i had astonished him
he stared in amazement and then snatched the paper from my hands
this was the paragraph which i had been engaged in reading when he rose from his chair murder in westminster
a crime of mysterious character was committed last night at godolphin street one of the old fashioned and secluded rows of eighteenth century houses which lie between the river and the abbey almost in the shadow of the great tower of the houses of parliament
this small but select mansion has been inhabited for some years by mr
eduardo lucas well known in society circles both on account of his charming personality and because he has the well deserved reputation of being one of the best amateur tenors in the country
mr
lucas is an unmarried man thirty four years of age and his establishment consists of mrs
pringle an elderly housekeeper and of mitton his valet
the former retires early and sleeps at the top of the house
the valet was out for the evening visiting a friend at hammersmith
from ten o'clock onwards mr
lucas had the house to himself
what occurred during that time has not yet transpired but at a quarter to twelve police constable barrett passing along godolphin street observed that the door of no
was ajar
he knocked but received no answer
perceiving a light in the front room he advanced into the passage and again knocked but without reply
he then pushed open the door and entered
the room was in a state of wild disorder the furniture being all swept to one side and one chair lying on its back in the centre
beside this chair and still grasping one of its legs lay the unfortunate tenant of the house
he had been stabbed to the heart and must have died instantly
the knife with which the crime had been committed was a curved indian dagger plucked down from a trophy of oriental arms which adorned one of the walls
robbery does not appear to have been the motive of the crime for there had been no attempt to remove the valuable contents of the room
mr
eduardo lucas was so well known and popular that his violent and mysterious fate will arouse painful interest and intense sympathy in a wide spread circle of friends
well watson what do you make of this
asked holmes after a long pause
it is an amazing coincidence
a coincidence
here is one of the three men whom we had named as possible actors in this drama and he meets a violent death during the very hours when we know that that drama was being enacted
the odds are enormous against its being coincidence
no figures could express them
no my dear watson the two events are connected must be connected
it is for us to find the connection
but now the official police must know all
not at all
they know all they see at godolphin street
they know and shall know nothing of whitehall terrace
only we know of both events and can trace the relation between them
there is one obvious point which would in any case have turned my suspicions against lucas
godolphin street westminster is only a few minutes' walk from whitehall terrace
the other secret agents whom i have named live in the extreme west end
it was easier therefore for lucas than for the others to establish a connection or receive a message from the european secretary's household a small thing and yet where events are compressed into a few hours it may prove essential
halloa
what have we here
mrs
hudson had appeared with a lady's card upon her salver
holmes glanced at it raised his eyebrows and handed it over to me
ask lady hilda trelawney hope if she will be kind enough to step up said he
a moment later our modest apartment already so distinguished that morning was further honoured by the entrance of the most lovely woman in london
i had often heard of the beauty of the youngest daughter of the duke of belminster but no description of it and no contemplation of colourless photographs had prepared me for the subtle delicate charm and the beautiful colouring of that exquisite head
and yet as we saw it that autumn morning it was not its beauty which would be the first thing to impress the observer
the cheek was lovely but it was paled with emotion the eyes were bright but it was the brightness of fever the sensitive mouth was tight and drawn in an effort after self command
terror not beauty was what sprang first to the eye as our fair visitor stood framed for an instant in the open door
has my husband been here mr
holmes
yes madam he has been here
mr
holmes i implore you not to tell him that i came here
holmes bowed coldly and motioned the lady to a chair
your ladyship places me in a very delicate position
i beg that you will sit down and tell me what you desire but i fear that i cannot make any unconditional promise
she swept across the room and seated herself with her back to the window
it was a queenly presence tall graceful and intensely womanly
mr
holmes she said and her white gloved hands clasped and unclasped as she spoke i will speak frankly to you in the hope that it may induce you to speak frankly in return
there is complete confidence between my husband and me on all matters save one
that one is politics
on this his lips are sealed
he tells me nothing
now i am aware that there was a most deplorable occurrence in our house last night
i know that a paper has disappeared
but because the matter is political my husband refuses to take me into his complete confidence
now it is essential essential i say that i should thoroughly understand it
you are the only other person save only these politicians who knows the true facts
i beg you then mr
holmes to tell me exactly what has happened and what it will lead to
tell me all mr
holmes
let no regard for your client's interests keep you silent for i assure you that his interests if he would only see it would be best served by taking me into his complete confidence
what was this paper which was stolen
madam what you ask me is really impossible
she groaned and sank her face in her hands
you must see that this is so madam
if your husband thinks fit to keep you in the dark over this matter is it for me who has only learned the true facts under the pledge of professional secrecy to tell what he has withheld
it is not fair to ask it
it is him whom you must ask
i have asked him
i come to you as a last resource
but without your telling me anything definite mr
holmes you may do a great service if you would enlighten me on one point
what is it madam
is my husband's political career likely to suffer through this incident
well madam unless it is set right it may certainly have a very unfortunate effect
ah
she drew in her breath sharply as one whose doubts are resolved
one more question mr
holmes
from an expression which my husband dropped in the first shock of this disaster i understood that terrible public consequences might arise from the loss of this document
if he said so i certainly cannot deny it
of what nature are they
nay madam there again you ask me more than i can possibly answer
then i will take up no more of your time
i cannot blame you mr
holmes for having refused to speak more freely and you on your side will not i am sure think the worse of me because i desire even against his will to share my husband's anxieties
once more i beg that you will say nothing of my visit
she looked back at us from the door and i had a last impression of that beautiful haunted face the startled eyes and the drawn mouth
then she was gone
now watson the fair sex is your department said holmes with a smile when the dwindling frou frou of skirts had ended in the slam of the front door
what was the fair lady's game
what did she really want
surely her own statement is clear and her anxiety very natural
hum
think of her appearance watson her manner her suppressed excitement her restlessness her tenacity in asking questions
remember that she comes of a caste who do not lightly show emotion
she was certainly much moved
remember also the curious earnestness with which she assured us that it was best for her husband that she should know all
what did she mean by that
and you must have observed watson how she manoeuvred to have the light at her back
she did not wish us to read her expression
yes she chose the one chair in the room
and yet the motives of women are so inscrutable
you remember the woman at margate whom i suspected for the same reason
no powder on her nose that proved to be the correct solution
how can you build on such a quicksand
their most trivial action may mean volumes or their most extraordinary conduct may depend upon a hairpin or a curling tongs
good morning watson
you are off
yes i will wile away the morning at godolphin street with our friends of the regular establishment
with eduardo lucas lies the solution of our problem though i must admit that i have not an inkling as to what form it may take
it is a capital mistake to theorize in advance of the facts
do you stay on guard my good watson and receive any fresh visitors
i'll join you at lunch if i am able
all that day and the next and the next holmes was in a mood which his friends would call taciturn and others morose
he ran out and ran in smoked incessantly played snatches on his violin sank into reveries devoured sandwiches at irregular hours and hardly answered the casual questions which i put to him
it was evident to me that things were not going well with him or his quest
he would say nothing of the case and it was from the papers that i learned the particulars of the inquest and the arrest with the subsequent release of john mitton the valet of the deceased
the coroner's jury brought in the obvious wilful murder but the parties remained as unknown as ever
no motive was suggested
the room was full of articles of value but none had been taken
the dead man's papers had not been tampered with
they were carefully examined and showed that he was a keen student of international politics an indefatigable gossip a remarkable linguist and an untiring letter writer
he had been on intimate terms with the leading politicians of several countries
but nothing sensational was discovered among the documents which filled his drawers
as to his relations with women they appeared to have been promiscuous but superficial
he had many acquaintances among them but few friends and no one whom he loved
his habits were regular his conduct inoffensive
his death was an absolute mystery and likely to remain so
as to the arrest of john mitton the valet it was a counsel of despair as an alternative to absolute inaction
but no case could be sustained against him
he had visited friends in hammersmith that night
the alibi was complete
it is true that he started home at an hour which should have brought him to westminster before the time when the crime was discovered but his own explanation that he had walked part of the way seemed probable enough in view of the fineness of the night
he had actually arrived at twelve o'clock and appeared to be overwhelmed by the unexpected tragedy
he had always been on good terms with his master
several of the dead man's possessions notably a small case of razors had been found in the valet's boxes but he explained that they had been presents from the deceased and the housekeeper was able to corroborate the story
mitton had been in lucas's employment for three years
it was noticeable that lucas did not take mitton on the continent with him
sometimes he visited paris for three months on end but mitton was left in charge of the godolphin street house
as to the housekeeper she had heard nothing on the night of the crime
if her master had a visitor he had himself admitted him
so for three mornings the mystery remained so far as i could follow it in the papers
if holmes knew more he kept his own counsel but as he told me that inspector lestrade had taken him into his confidence in the case i knew that he was in close touch with every development
upon the fourth day there appeared a long telegram from paris which seemed to solve the whole question
a discovery has just been made by the parisian police said the daily telegraph which raises the veil which hung round the tragic fate of mr
eduardo lucas who met his death by violence last monday night at godolphin street westminster
our readers will remember that the deceased gentleman was found stabbed in his room and that some suspicion attached to his valet but that the case broke down on an alibi
yesterday a lady who has been known as mme
henri fournaye occupying a small villa in the rue austerlitz was reported to the authorities by her servants as being insane
an examination showed that she had indeed developed mania of a dangerous and permanent form
on inquiry the police have discovered that mme
henri fournaye only returned from a journey to london on tuesday last and there is evidence to connect her with the crime at westminster
a comparison of photographs has proved conclusively that m henri fournaye and eduardo lucas were really one and the same person and that the deceased had for some reason lived a double life in london and paris
mme
fournaye who is of creole origin is of an extremely excitable nature and has suffered in the past from attacks of jealousy which have amounted to frenzy
it is conjectured that it was in one of these that she committed the terrible crime which has caused such a sensation in london
her movements upon the monday night have not yet been traced but it is undoubted that a woman answering to her description attracted much attention at charing cross station on tuesday morning by the wildness of her appearance and the violence of her gestures
it is probable therefore that the crime was either committed when insane or that its immediate effect was to drive the unhappy woman out of her mind
at present she is unable to give any coherent account of the past and the doctors hold out no hopes of the re establishment of her reason
there is evidence that a woman who might have been mme
fournaye was seen for some hours on monday night watching the house in godolphin street
what do you think of that holmes
i had read the account aloud to him while he finished his breakfast
my dear watson said he as he rose from the table and paced up and down the room you are most long suffering but if i have told you nothing in the last three days it is because there is nothing to tell
even now this report from paris does not help us much
surely it is final as regards the man's death
the man's death is a mere incident a trivial episode in comparison with our real task which is to trace this document and save a european catastrophe
only one important thing has happened in the last three days and that is that nothing has happened
i get reports almost hourly from the government and it is certain that nowhere in europe is there any sign of trouble
now if this letter were loose no it can't be loose but if it isn't loose where can it be
who has it
why is it held back
that's the question that beats in my brain like a hammer
was it indeed a coincidence that lucas should meet his death on the night when the letter disappeared
did the letter ever reach him
if so why is it not among his papers
did this mad wife of his carry it off with her
if so is it in her house in paris
how could i search for it without the french police having their suspicions aroused
it is a case my dear watson where the law is as dangerous to us as the criminals are
every man's hand is against us and yet the interests at stake are colossal
should i bring it to a successful conclusion it will certainly represent the crowning glory of my career
ah here is my latest from the front
he glanced hurriedly at the note which had been handed in
halloa
lestrade seems to have observed something of interest
put on your hat watson and we will stroll down together to westminster
it was my first visit to the scene of the crime a high dingy narrow chested house prim formal and solid like the century which gave it birth
lestrade's bulldog features gazed out at us from the front window and he greeted us warmly when a big constable had opened the door and let us in
the room into which we were shown was that in which the crime had been committed but no trace of it now remained save an ugly irregular stain upon the carpet
this carpet was a small square drugget in the centre of the room surrounded by a broad expanse of beautiful old fashioned wood flooring in square blocks highly polished
over the fireplace was a magnificent trophy of weapons one of which had been used on that tragic night
in the window was a sumptuous writing desk and every detail of the apartment the pictures the rugs and the hangings all pointed to a taste which was luxurious to the verge of effeminacy
seen the paris news
asked lestrade
holmes nodded
our french friends seem to have touched the spot this time
no doubt it's just as they say
she knocked at the door surprise visit i guess for he kept his life in water tight compartments
he let her in couldn't keep her in the street
she told him how she had traced him reproached him one thing led to another and then with that dagger so handy the end soon came
it wasn't all done in an instant though for these chairs were all swept over yonder and he had one in his hand as if he had tried to hold her off with it
we've got it all clear as if we had seen it
holmes raised his eyebrows
and yet you have sent for me
ah yes that's another matter a mere trifle but the sort of thing you take an interest in queer you know and what you might call freakish
it has nothing to do with the main fact can't have on the face of it
what is it then
well you know after a crime of this sort we are very careful to keep things in their position
nothing has been moved
officer in charge here day and night
this morning as the man was buried and the investigation over so far as this room is concerned we thought we could tidy up a bit
this carpet
you see it is not fastened down only just laid there
we had occasion to raise it
we found yes
you found holmes's face grew tense with anxiety
well i'm sure you would never guess in a hundred years what we did find
you see that stain on the carpet
well a great deal must have soaked through must it not
undoubtedly it must
well you will be surprised to hear that there is no stain on the white woodwork to correspond
no stain
but there must yes so you would say
but the fact remains that there isn't
he took the corner of the carpet in his hand and turning it over he showed that it was indeed as he said
but the underside is as stained as the upper
it must have left a mark
lestrade chuckled with delight at having puzzled the famous expert
now i'll show you the explanation
there is a second stain but it does not correspond with the other
see for yourself
as he spoke he turned over another portion of the carpet and there sure enough was a great crimson spill upon the square white facing of the old fashioned floor
what do you make of that mr
holmes
why it is simple enough
the two stains did correspond but the carpet has been turned round
as it was square and unfastened it was easily done
the official police don't need you mr
holmes to tell them that the carpet must have been turned round
that's clear enough for the stains lie above each other if you lay it over this way
but what i want to know is who shifted the carpet and why
i could see from holmes's rigid face that he was vibrating with inward excitement
look here lestrade said he has that constable in the passage been in charge of the place all the time
yes he has
well take my advice
examine him carefully
don't do it before us
we'll wait here
you take him into the back room
you'll be more likely to get a confession out of him alone
ask him how he dared to admit people and leave them alone in this room
don't ask him if he has done it
take it for granted
tell him you know someone has been here
press him
tell him that a full confession is his only chance of forgiveness
do exactly what i tell you
by george if he knows i'll have it out of him
cried lestrade
he darted into the hall and a few moments later his bullying voice sounded from the back room
now watson now
cried holmes with frenzied eagerness
all the demoniacal force of the man masked behind that listless manner burst out in a paroxysm of energy
he tore the drugget from the floor and in an instant was down on his hands and knees clawing at each of the squares of wood beneath it
one turned sideways as he dug his nails into the edge of it
it hinged back like the lid of a box
a small black cavity opened beneath it
holmes plunged his eager hand into it and drew it out with a bitter snarl of anger and disappointment
it was empty
quick watson quick
get it back again
the wooden lid was replaced and the drugget had only just been drawn straight when lestrade's voice was heard in the passage
he found holmes leaning languidly against the mantelpiece resigned and patient endeavouring to conceal his irrepressible yawns
sorry to keep you waiting mr
holmes
i can see that you are bored to death with the whole affair
well he has confessed all right
come in here macpherson
let these gentlemen hear of your most inexcusable conduct
the big constable very hot and penitent sidled into the room
i meant no harm sir i'm sure
the young woman came to the door last evening mistook the house she did
and then we got talking
it's lonesome when you're on duty here all day
well what happened then
she wanted to see where the crime was done had read about it in the papers she said
she was a very respectable well spoken young woman sir and i saw no harm in letting her have a peep
when she saw that mark on the carpet down she dropped on the floor and lay as if she were dead
i ran to the back and got some water but i could not bring her to
then i went round the corner to the ivy plant for some brandy and by the time i had brought it back the young woman had recovered and was off ashamed of herself i dare say and dared not face me
how about moving that drugget
well sir it was a bit rumpled certainly when i came back
you see she fell on it and it lies on a polished floor with nothing to keep it in place
i straightened it out afterwards
it's a lesson to you that you can't deceive me constable macpherson said lestrade with dignity
no doubt you thought that your breach of duty could never be discovered and yet a mere glance at that drugget was enough to convince me that someone had been admitted to the room
it's lucky for you my man that nothing is missing or you would find yourself in queer street
i'm sorry to have called you down over such a petty business mr
holmes but i thought the point of the second stain not corresponding with the first would interest you
certainly it was most interesting
has this woman only been here once constable
yes sir only once
who was she
don't know the name sir
was answering an advertisement about type writing and came to the wrong number very pleasant genteel young woman sir
tall
handsome
yes sir she was a well grown young woman
i suppose you might say she was handsome
perhaps some would say she was very handsome
'oh officer do let me have a peep '
says she
she had pretty coaxing ways as you might say and i thought there was no harm in letting her just put her head through the door
how was she dressed
quiet sir a long mantle down to her feet
what time was it
it was just growing dusk at the time
they were lighting the lamps as i came back with the brandy
very good said holmes
come watson i think that we have more important work elsewhere
as we left the house lestrade remained in the front room while the repentant constable opened the door to let us out
holmes turned on the step and held up something in his hand
the constable stared intently
good lord sir
he cried with amazement on his face
holmes put his finger on his lips replaced his hand in his breast pocket and burst out laughing as we turned down the street
excellent
said he
come friend watson the curtain rings up for the last act
you will be relieved to hear that there will be no war that the right honourable trelawney hope will suffer no set back in his brilliant career that the indiscreet sovereign will receive no punishment for his indiscretion that the prime minister will have no european complication to deal with and that with a little tact and management upon our part nobody will be a penny the worse for what might have been a very ugly incident
my mind filled with admiration for this extraordinary man
you have solved it
i cried
hardly that watson
there are some points which are as dark as ever
but we have so much that it will be our own fault if we cannot get the rest
we will go straight to whitehall terrace and bring the matter to a head
when we arrived at the residence of the european secretary it was for lady hilda trelawney hope that sherlock holmes inquired
we were shown into the morning room
mr
holmes
said the lady and her face was pink with her indignation this is surely most unfair and ungenerous upon your part
i desired as i have explained to keep my visit to you a secret lest my husband should think that i was intruding into his affairs
and yet you compromise me by coming here and so showing that there are business relations between us
unfortunately madam i had no possible alternative
i have been commissioned to recover this immensely important paper
i must therefore ask you madam to be kind enough to place it in my hands
the lady sprang to her feet with the colour all dashed in an instant from her beautiful face
her eyes glazed she tottered i thought that she would faint
then with a grand effort she rallied from the shock and a supreme astonishment and indignation chased every other expression from her features
you you insult me mr
holmes
come come madam it is useless
give up the letter
she darted to the bell
the butler shall show you out
do not ring lady hilda
if you do then all my earnest efforts to avoid a scandal will be frustrated
give up the letter and all will be set right
if you will work with me i can arrange everything
if you work against me i must expose you
she stood grandly defiant a queenly figure her eyes fixed upon his as if she would read his very soul
her hand was on the bell but she had forborne to ring it
you are trying to frighten me
it is not a very manly thing mr
holmes to come here and browbeat a woman
you say that you know something
what is it that you know
pray sit down madam
you will hurt yourself there if you fall
i will not speak until you sit down
thank you
i give you five minutes mr
holmes
one is enough lady hilda
i know of your visit to eduardo lucas of your giving him this document of your ingenious return to the room last night and of the manner in which you took the letter from the hiding place under the carpet
she stared at him with an ashen face and gulped twice before she could speak
you are mad mr
holmes you are mad
she cried at last
he drew a small piece of cardboard from his pocket
it was the face of a woman cut out of a portrait
i have carried this because i thought it might be useful said he
the policeman has recognised it
she gave a gasp and her head dropped back in the chair
come lady hilda
you have the letter
the matter may still be adjusted
i have no desire to bring trouble to you
my duty ends when i have returned the lost letter to your husband
take my advice and be frank with me it is your only chance
her courage was admirable
even now she would not own defeat
i tell you again mr
holmes that you are under some absurd illusion
holmes rose from his chair
i am sorry for you lady hilda
i have done my best for you i can see that it is all in vain
he rang the bell
the butler entered
is mr
trelawney hope at home
he will be home sir at a quarter to one
holmes glanced at his watch
still a quarter of an hour said he
very good i shall wait
the butler had hardly closed the door behind him when lady hilda was down on her knees at holmes's feet her hands out stretched her beautiful face upturned and wet with her tears
oh spare me mr
holmes
spare me
she pleaded in a frenzy of supplication
for heaven's sake don't tell him
i love him so
i would not bring one shadow on his life and this i know would break his noble heart
holmes raised the lady
i am thankful madam that you have come to your senses even at this last moment
there is not an instant to lose
where is the letter
she darted across to a writing desk unlocked it and drew out a long blue envelope
here it is mr
holmes
would to heaven i had never seen it
how can we return it
holmes muttered
quick quick we must think of some way
where is the despatch box
still in his bedroom
what a stroke of luck
quick madam bring it here
a moment later she had appeared with a red flat box in her hand
how did you open it before
you have a duplicate key
yes of course you have
open it
from out of her bosom lady hilda had drawn a small key
the box flew open
it was stuffed with papers
holmes thrust the blue envelope deep down into the heart of them between the leaves of some other document
the box was shut locked and returned to the bedroom
now we are ready for him said holmes we have still ten minutes
i am going far to screen you lady hilda
in return you will spend the time in telling me frankly the real meaning of this extraordinary affair
mr
holmes i will tell you everything cried the lady
oh mr
holmes i would cut off my right hand before i gave him a moment of sorrow
there is no woman in all london who loves her husband as i do and yet if he knew how i have acted how i have been compelled to act he would never forgive me
for his own honour stands so high that he could not forget or pardon a lapse in another
help me mr
holmes
my happiness his happiness our very lives are at stake
quick madam the time grows short
it was a letter of mine mr
holmes an indiscreet letter written before my marriage a foolish letter a letter of an impulsive loving girl
i meant no harm and yet he would have thought it criminal
had he read that letter his confidence would have been for ever destroyed
it is years since i wrote it
i had thought that the whole matter was forgotten
then at last i heard from this man lucas that it had passed into his hands and that he would lay it before my husband
i implored his mercy
he said that he would return my letter if i would bring him a certain document which he described in my husband's despatch box
he had some spy in the office who had told him of its existence
he assured me that no harm could come to my husband
put yourself in my position mr
holmes
what was i to do
take your husband into your confidence
i could not mr
holmes i could not
on the one side seemed certain ruin on the other terrible as it seemed to take my husband's paper still in a matter of politics i could not understand the consequences while in a matter of love and trust they were only too clear to me
i did it mr
holmes
i took an impression of his key this man lucas furnished a duplicate
i opened his despatch box took the paper and conveyed it to godolphin street
what happened there madam
i tapped at the door as agreed
lucas opened it
i followed him into his room leaving the hall door ajar behind me for i feared to be alone with the man
i remember that there was a woman outside as i entered
our business was soon done
he had my letter on his desk i handed him the document
he gave me the letter
at this instant there was a sound at the door
there were steps in the passage
lucas quickly turned back the drugget thrust the document into some hiding place there and covered it over
what happened after that is like some fearful dream
i have a vision of a dark frantic face of a woman's voice which screamed in french 'my waiting is not in vain
at last at last i have found you with her '
there was a savage struggle
i saw him with a chair in his hand a knife gleamed in hers
i rushed from the horrible scene ran from the house and only next morning in the paper did i learn the dreadful result
that night i was happy for i had my letter and i had not seen yet what the future would bring
it was the next morning that i realized that i had only exchanged one trouble for another
my husband's anguish at the loss of his paper went to my heart
i could hardly prevent myself from there and then kneeling down at his feet and telling him what i had done
but that again would mean a confession of the past
i came to you that morning in order to understand the full enormity of my offence
from the instant that i grasped it my whole mind was turned to the one thought of getting back my husband's paper
it must still be where lucas had placed it for it was concealed before this dreadful woman entered the room
if it had not been for her coming i should not have known where his hiding place was
how was i to get into the room
for two days i watched the place but the door was never left open
last night i made a last attempt
what i did and how i succeeded you have already learned
i brought the paper back with me and thought of destroying it since i could see no way of returning it without confessing my guilt to my husband
heavens i hear his step upon the stair
the european secretary burst excitedly into the room
any news mr
holmes any news
he cried
i have some hopes
ah thank heaven
his face became radiant
the prime minister is lunching with me
may he share your hopes
he has nerves of steel and yet i know that he has hardly slept since this terrible event
jacobs will you ask the prime minister to come up
as to you dear i fear that this is a matter of politics
we will join you in a few minutes in the dining room
the prime minister's manner was subdued but i could see by the gleam of his eyes and the twitchings of his bony hands that he shared the excitement of his young colleague
i understand that you have something to report mr
holmes
purely negative as yet my friend answered
i have inquired at every point where it might be and i am sure that there is no danger to be apprehended
but that is not enough mr
holmes
we cannot live for ever on such a volcano
we must have something definite
i am in hopes of getting it
that is why i am here
the more i think of the matter the more convinced i am that the letter has never left this house
mr
holmes
if it had it would certainly have been public by now
but why should anyone take it in order to keep it in his house
i am not convinced that anyone did take it
then how could it leave the despatch box
i am not convinced that it ever did leave the despatch box
mr
holmes this joking is very ill timed
you have my assurance that it left the box
have you examined the box since tuesday morning
no it was not necessary
you may conceivably have overlooked it
impossible i say
but i am not convinced of it i have known such things to happen
i presume there are other papers there
well it may have got mixed with them
it was on the top
someone may have shaken the box and displaced it
no no i had everything out
surely it is easily decided hope said the premier
let us have the despatch box brought in
the secretary rang the bell
jacobs bring down my despatch box
this is a farcical waste of time but still if nothing else will satisfy you it shall be done
thank you jacobs put it here
i have always had the key on my watch chain
here are the papers you see
letter from lord merrow report from sir charles hardy memorandum from belgrade note on the russo german grain taxes letter from madrid note from lord flowers good heavens
what is this
lord bellinger
lord bellinger
the premier snatched the blue envelope from his hand
yes it is it and the letter is intact
hope i congratulate you
thank you
thank you
what a weight from my heart
but this is inconceivable impossible
mr
holmes you are a wizard a sorcerer
how did you know it was there
because i knew it was nowhere else
i cannot believe my eyes
he ran wildly to the door
where is my wife
i must tell her that all is well
hilda
hilda
we heard his voice on the stairs
the premier looked at holmes with twinkling eyes
come sir said he
there is more in this than meets the eye
how came the letter back in the box
holmes turned away smiling from the keen scrutiny of those wonderful eyes
we also have our diplomatic secrets said he and picking up his hat he turned to the door
