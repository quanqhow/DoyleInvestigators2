{"The Circular Staircase": "This is the story of how a middle-aged spinster lost her mind, deserted\r\nher domestic gods in the city, took a furnished house for the summer\r\nout of town, and found herself involved in one of those mysterious\r\ncrimes that keep our newspapers and detective agencies happy and\r\nprosperous.  For twenty years I had been perfectly comfortable; for\r\ntwenty years I had had the window-boxes filled in the spring, the\r\ncarpets lifted, the awnings put up and the furniture covered with brown\r\nlinen; for as many summers I had said good-by to my friends, and, after\r\nwatching their perspiring hegira, had settled down to a delicious quiet\r\nin town, where the mail comes three times a day, and the water supply\r\ndoes not depend on a tank on the roof.\r\n\r\nAnd then--the madness seized me.  When I look back over the months I\r\nspent at Sunnyside, I wonder that I survived at all.  As it is, I show\r\nthe wear and tear of my harrowing experiences.  I have turned very\r\ngray--Liddy reminded me of it, only yesterday, by saying that a little\r\nbluing in the rinse-water would make my hair silvery, instead of a\r\nyellowish white.  I hate to be reminded of unpleasant things and I\r\nsnapped her off.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said sharply, \"I'm not going to use bluing at my time of life,\r\nor starch, either.\"\r\n\r\nLiddy's nerves are gone, she says, since that awful summer, but she has\r\nenough left, goodness knows!  And when she begins to go around with a\r\nlump in her throat, all I have to do is to threaten to return to\r\nSunnyside, and she is frightened into a semblance of\r\ncheerfulness,--from which you may judge that the summer there was\r\nanything but a success.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper accounts have been so garbled and incomplete--one of them\r\nmentioned me but once, and then only as the tenant at the time the\r\nthing happened--that I feel it my due to tell what I know.  Mr.\r\nJamieson, the detective, said himself he could never have done without\r\nme, although he gave me little enough credit, in print.\r\n\r\nI shall have to go back several years--thirteen, to be exact--to start\r\nmy story.  At that time my brother died, leaving me his two children.\r\nHalsey was eleven then, and Gertrude was seven.  All the\r\nresponsibilities of maternity were thrust upon me suddenly; to perfect\r\nthe profession of motherhood requires precisely as many years as the\r\nchild has lived, like the man who started to carry the calf and ended\r\nby walking along with the bull on his shoulders.  However, I did the\r\nbest I could.  When Gertrude got past the hair-ribbon age, and Halsey\r\nasked for a scarf-pin and put on long trousers--and a wonderful help\r\nthat was to the darning.--I sent them away to good schools.  After\r\nthat, my responsibility was chiefly postal, with three months every\r\nsummer in which to replenish their wardrobes, look over their lists of\r\nacquaintances, and generally to take my foster-motherhood out of its\r\nnine months' retirement in camphor.\r\n\r\nI missed the summers with them when, somewhat later, at boarding-school\r\nand college, the children spent much of their vacations with friends.\r\nGradually I found that my name signed to a check was even more welcome\r\nthan when signed to a letter, though I wrote them at stated intervals.\r\nBut when Halsey had finished his electrical course and Gertrude her\r\nboarding-school, and both came home to stay, things were suddenly\r\nchanged.  The winter Gertrude came out was nothing but a succession of\r\nsitting up late at night to bring her home from things, taking her to\r\nthe dressmakers between naps the next day, and discouraging ineligible\r\nyouths with either more money than brains, or more brains than money.\r\nAlso, I acquired a great many things: to say lingerie for\r\nunder-garments, \"frocks\" and \"gowns\" instead of dresses, and that\r\nbeardless sophomores are not college boys, but college men.  Halsey\r\nrequired less personal supervision, and as they both got their mother's\r\nfortune that winter, my responsibility became purely moral.  Halsey\r\nbought a car, of course, and I learned how to tie over my bonnet a gray\r\nbaize veil, and, after a time, never to stop to look at the dogs one\r\nhas run down.  People are apt to be so unpleasant about their dogs.\r\n\r\nThe additions to my education made me a properly equipped maiden aunt,\r\nand by spring I was quite tractable.  So when Halsey suggested camping\r\nin the Adirondacks and Gertrude wanted Bar Harbor, we compromised on a\r\ngood country house with links near, within motor distance of town and\r\ntelephone distance of the doctor.  That was how we went to Sunnyside.\r\n\r\nWe went out to inspect the property, and it seemed to deserve its name.\r\nIts cheerful appearance gave no indication whatever of anything out of\r\nthe ordinary.  Only one thing seemed unusual to me: the housekeeper,\r\nwho had been left in charge, had moved from the house to the gardener's\r\nlodge, a few days before.  As the lodge was far enough away from the\r\nhouse, it seemed to me that either fire or thieves could complete their\r\nwork of destruction undisturbed.  The property was an extensive one:\r\nthe house on the top of a hill, which sloped away in great stretches of\r\ngreen lawn and clipped hedges, to the road; and across the valley,\r\nperhaps a couple of miles away, was the Greenwood Club House.  Gertrude\r\nand Halsey were infatuated.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's everything you want,\" Halsey said \"View, air, good water and\r\ngood roads.  As for the house, it's big enough for a hospital, if it\r\nhas a Queen Anne front and a Mary Anne back,\" which was ridiculous: it\r\nwas pure Elizabethan.\r\n\r\nOf course we took the place; it was not my idea of comfort, being much\r\ntoo large and sufficiently isolated to make the servant question\r\nserious.  But I give myself credit for this: whatever has happened\r\nsince, I never blamed Halsey and Gertrude for taking me there.  And\r\nanother thing: if the series of catastrophes there did nothing else, it\r\ntaught me one thing--that somehow, somewhere, from perhaps a\r\nhalf-civilized ancestor who wore a sheepskin garment and trailed his\r\nfood or his prey, I have in me the instinct of the chase.  Were I a man\r\nI should be a trapper of criminals, trailing them as relentlessly as no\r\ndoubt my sheepskin ancestor did his wild boar.  But being an unmarried\r\nwoman, with the handicap of my sex, my first acquaintance with crime\r\nwill probably be my last.  Indeed, it came near enough to being my last\r\nacquaintance with anything.\r\n\r\nThe property was owned by Paul Armstrong, the president of the Traders'\r\nBank, who at the time we took the house was in the west with his wife\r\nand daughter, and a Doctor Walker, the Armstrong family physician.\r\nHalsey knew Louise Armstrong,--had been rather attentive to her the\r\nwinter before, but as Halsey was always attentive to somebody, I had\r\nnot thought of it seriously, although she was a charming girl.  I knew\r\nof Mr. Armstrong only through his connection with the bank, where the\r\nchildren's money was largely invested, and through an ugly story about\r\nthe son, Arnold Armstrong, who was reported to have forged his father's\r\nname, for a considerable amount, to some bank paper.  However, the\r\nstory had had no interest for me.\r\n\r\nI cleared Halsey and Gertrude away to a house party, and moved out to\r\nSunnyside the first of May.  The roads were bad, but the trees were in\r\nleaf, and there were still tulips in the borders around the house.  The\r\narbutus was fragrant in the woods under the dead leaves, and on the way\r\nfrom the station, a short mile, while the car stuck in the mud, I found\r\na bank showered with tiny forget-me-nots.  The birds--don't ask me what\r\nkind; they all look alike to me, unless they have a hall mark of some\r\nbright color--the birds were chirping in the hedges, and everything\r\nbreathed of peace.  Liddy, who was born and bred on a brick pavement,\r\ngot a little bit down-spirited when the crickets began to chirp, or\r\nscrape their legs together, or whatever it is they do, at twilight.\r\n\r\nThe first night passed quietly enough.  I have always been grateful for\r\nthat one night's peace; it shows what the country might be, under\r\nfavorable circumstances.  Never after that night did I put my head on\r\nmy pillow with any assurance how long it would be there; or on my\r\nshoulders, for that matter.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Liddy and Mrs. Ralston, my own housekeeper,\r\nhad a difference of opinion, and Mrs. Ralston left on the eleven train.\r\nJust after luncheon, Burke, the butler, was taken unexpectedly with a\r\npain in his right side, much worse when I was within hearing distance,\r\nand by afternoon he was started cityward.  That night the cook's sister\r\nhad a baby--the cook, seeing indecision in my face, made it twins on\r\nsecond thought--and, to be short, by noon the next day the household\r\nstaff was down to Liddy and myself.  And this in a house with\r\ntwenty-two rooms and five baths!\r\n\r\nLiddy wanted to go back to the city at once, but the milk-boy said that\r\nThomas Johnson, the Armstrongs' colored butler, was working as a waiter\r\nat the Greenwood Club, and might come back. I have the usual scruples\r\nabout coercing people's servants away, but few of us have any\r\nconscience regarding institutions or corporations--witness the way we\r\nbeat railroads and street-car companies when we can--so I called up the\r\nclub, and about eight o'clock Thomas Johnson came to see me.  Poor\r\nThomas!\r\n\r\nWell, it ended by my engaging Thomas on the spot, at outrageous wages,\r\nand with permission to sleep in the gardener's lodge, empty since the\r\nhouse was rented.  The old man--he was white-haired and a little\r\nstooped, but with an immense idea of his personal dignity--gave me his\r\nreasons hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\"I ain't sayin' nothin', Mis' Innes,\" he said, with his hand on the\r\ndoor-knob, \"but there's been goin's-on here this las' few months as\r\nain't natchal.  'Tain't one thing an' 'tain't another--it's jest a door\r\nsquealin' here, an' a winder closin' there, but when doors an' winders\r\ngets to cuttin' up capers and there's nobody nigh 'em, it's time Thomas\r\nJohnson sleeps somewhar's else.\"\r\n\r\nLiddy, who seemed to be never more than ten feet away from me that\r\nnight, and was afraid of her shadow in that great barn of a place,\r\nscreamed a little, and turned a yellow-green.  But I am not easily\r\nalarmed.\r\n\r\nIt was entirely in vain; I represented to Thomas that we were alone,\r\nand that he would have to stay in the house that night. He was politely\r\nfirm, but he would come over early the next morning, and if I gave him\r\na key, he would come in time to get some sort of breakfast.  I stood on\r\nthe huge veranda and watched him shuffle along down the shadowy drive,\r\nwith mingled feelings--irritation at his cowardice and thankfulness at\r\ngetting him at all.  I am not ashamed to say that I double-locked the\r\nhall door when I went in.\r\n\r\n\"You can lock up the rest of the house and go to bed, Liddy,\" I said\r\nseverely.  \"You give me the creeps standing there.  A woman of your age\r\nought to have better sense.\"  It usually braces Liddy to mention her\r\nage: she owns to forty--which is absurd.  Her mother cooked for my\r\ngrandfather, and Liddy must be at least as old as I.  But that night\r\nshe refused to brace.\r\n\r\n\"You're not going to ask me to lock up, Miss Rachel!\" she quavered.\r\n\"Why, there's a dozen French windows in the drawing-room and the\r\nbilliard-room wing, and every one opens on a porch. And Mary Anne said\r\nthat last night there was a man standing by the stable when she locked\r\nthe kitchen door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mary Anne was a fool,\" I said sternly.  \"If there had been a man\r\nthere, she would have had him in the kitchen and been feeding him what\r\nwas left from dinner, inside of an hour, from force of habit.  Now\r\ndon't be ridiculous.  Lock up the house and go to bed.  I am going to\r\nread.\"\r\n\r\nBut Liddy set her lips tight and stood still.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to bed,\" she said.  \"I am going to pack up, and\r\nto-morrow I am going to leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll do nothing of the sort,\" I snapped.  Liddy and I often desire\r\nto part company, but never at the same time.  \"If you are afraid, I\r\nwill go with you, but for goodness' sake don't try to hide behind me.\"\r\n\r\nThe house was a typical summer residence on an extensive scale.\r\nWherever possible, on the first floor, the architect had done away with\r\npartitions, using arches and columns instead.  The effect was cool and\r\nspacious, but scarcely cozy.  As Liddy and I went from one window to\r\nanother, our voices echoed back at us uncomfortably.  There was plenty\r\nof light--the electric plant down in the village supplied us--but there\r\nwere long vistas of polished floor, and mirrors which reflected us from\r\nunexpected corners, until I felt some of Liddy's foolishness\r\ncommunicate itself to me.\r\n\r\nThe house was very long, a rectangle in general form, with the main\r\nentrance in the center of the long side.  The brick-paved entry opened\r\ninto a short hall to the right of which, separated only by a row of\r\npillars, was a huge living-room.  Beyond that was the drawing-room, and\r\nin the end, the billiard-room.  Off the billiard-room, in the extreme\r\nright wing, was a den, or card-room, with a small hall opening on the\r\neast veranda, and from there went up a narrow circular staircase.\r\nHalsey had pointed it out with delight.\r\n\r\n\"Just look, Aunt Rachel,\" he said with a flourish.  \"The architect that\r\nput up this joint was wise to a few things. Arnold Armstrong and his\r\nfriends could sit here and play cards all night and stumble up to bed\r\nin the early morning, without having the family send in a police call.\"\r\n\r\nLiddy and I got as far as the card-room and turned on all the lights.\r\nI tried the small entry door there, which opened on the veranda, and\r\nexamined the windows.  Everything was secure, and Liddy, a little less\r\nnervous now, had just pointed out to me the disgracefully dusty\r\ncondition of the hard-wood floor, when suddenly the lights went out.\r\nWe waited a moment; I think Liddy was stunned with fright, or she would\r\nhave screamed.  And then I clutched her by the arm and pointed to one\r\nof the windows opening on the porch.  The sudden change threw the\r\nwindow into relief, an oblong of grayish light, and showed us a figure\r\nstanding close, peering in.  As I looked it darted across the veranda\r\nand out of sight in the darkness.\r\n\nLiddy's knees seemed to give away under her.  Without a sound she sank\r\ndown, leaving me staring at the window in petrified amazement.  Liddy\r\nbegan to moan under her breath, and in my excitement I reached down and\r\nshook her.\r\n\r\n\"Stop it,\" I whispered.  \"It's only a woman--maybe a maid of the\r\nArmstrongs'.  Get up and help me find the door.\"  She groaned again.\r\n\"Very well,\" I said, \"then I'll have to leave you here. I'm going.\"\r\n\r\nShe moved at that, and, holding to my sleeve, we felt our way, with\r\nnumerous collisions, to the billiard-room, and from there to the\r\ndrawing-room.  The lights came on then, and, with the long French\r\nwindows unshuttered, I had a creepy feeling that each one sheltered a\r\npeering face.  In fact, in the light of what happened afterward, I am\r\npretty certain we were under surveillance during the entire ghostly\r\nevening.  We hurried over the rest of the locking-up and got upstairs\r\nas quickly as we could.  I left the lights all on, and our footsteps\r\nechoed cavernously.  Liddy had a stiff neck the next morning, from\r\nlooking back over her shoulder, and she refused to go to bed.\r\n\r\n\"Let me stay in your dressing-room, Miss Rachel,\" she begged. \"If you\r\ndon't, I'll sit in the hall outside the door.  I'm not going to be\r\nmurdered with my eyes shut.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you're going to be murdered,\" I retorted, \"it won't make any\r\ndifference whether they are shut or open.  But you may stay in the\r\ndressing-room, if you will lie on the couch: when you sleep in a chair\r\nyou snore.\"\r\n\r\nShe was too far gone to be indignant, but after a while she came to the\r\ndoor and looked in to where I was composing myself for sleep with\r\nDrummond's Spiritual Life.\r\n\r\n\"That wasn't a woman, Miss Rachel,\" she said, with her shoes in her\r\nhand.  \"It was a man in a long coat.\"\r\n\r\n\"What woman was a man?\"  I discouraged her without looking up, and she\r\nwent back to the couch.\r\n\r\nIt was eleven o'clock when I finally prepared for bed.  In spite of my\r\nassumption of indifference, I locked the door into the hall, and\r\nfinding the transom did not catch, I put a chair cautiously before the\r\ndoor--it was not necessary to rouse Liddy--and climbing up put on the\r\nledge of the transom a small dressing-mirror, so that any movement of\r\nthe frame would send it crashing down.  Then, secure in my precautions,\r\nI went to bed.\r\n\r\nI did not go to sleep at once.  Liddy disturbed me just as I was\r\ngrowing drowsy, by coming in and peering under the bed.  She was afraid\r\nto speak, however, because of her previous snubbing, and went back,\r\nstopping in the doorway to sigh dismally.\r\n\r\nSomewhere down-stairs a clock with a chime sang away the\r\nhours--eleven-thirty, forty-five, twelve.  And then the lights went out\r\nto stay.  The Casanova Electric Company shuts up shop and goes home to\r\nbed at midnight: when one has a party, I believe it is customary to fee\r\nthe company, which will drink hot coffee and keep awake a couple of\r\nhours longer.  But the lights were gone for good that night.  Liddy had\r\ngone to sleep, as I knew she would.  She was a very unreliable person:\r\nalways awake and ready to talk when she wasn't wanted and dozing off to\r\nsleep when she was.  I called her once or twice, the only result being\r\nan explosive snore that threatened her very windpipe--then I got up and\r\nlighted a bedroom candle.\r\n\r\nMy bedroom and dressing room were above the big living-room on the\r\nfirst floor.  On the second floor a long corridor ran the length of the\r\nhouse, with rooms opening from both sides.  In the wings were small\r\ncorridors crossing the main one--the plan was simplicity itself.  And\r\njust as I got back into bed, I heard a sound from the east wing,\r\napparently, that made me stop, frozen, with one bedroom slipper half\r\noff, and listen.  It was a rattling metallic sound, and it reverberated\r\nalong the empty halls like the crash of doom.  It was for all the world\r\nas if something heavy, perhaps a piece of steel, had rolled clattering\r\nand jangling down the hard-wood stairs leading to the card-room.\r\n\r\nIn the silence that followed Liddy stirred and snored again.  I was\r\nexasperated: first she kept me awake by silly alarms, then when she was\r\nneeded she slept like Joe Jefferson, or Rip,--they are always the same\r\nto me.  I went in and aroused her, and I give her credit for being wide\r\nawake the minute I spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Get up,\" I said, \"if you don't want to be murdered in your bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?  How?\" she yelled vociferously, and jumped up.\r\n\r\n\"There's somebody in the house,\" I said.  \"Get up.  We'll have to get\r\nto the telephone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not out in the hall!\" she gasped; \"Oh, Miss Rachel, not out in the\r\nhall!\" trying to hold me back.  But I am a large woman and Liddy is\r\nsmall.  We got to the door, somehow, and Liddy held a brass andiron,\r\nwhich it was all she could do to lift, let alone brain anybody with.  I\r\nlistened, and, hearing nothing, opened the door a little and peered\r\ninto the hall.  It was a black void, full of terrible suggestion, and\r\nmy candle only emphasized the gloom.  Liddy squealed and drew me back\r\nagain, and as the door slammed, the mirror I had put on the transom\r\ncame down and hit her on the head.  That completed our demoralization.\r\nIt was some time before I could persuade her she had not been attacked\r\nfrom behind by a burglar, and when she found the mirror smashed on the\r\nfloor she wasn't much better.\r\n\r\n\"There's going to be a death!\" she wailed.  \"Oh, Miss Rachel, there's\r\ngoing to be a death!\"\r\n\r\n\"There will be,\" I said grimly, \"if you don't keep quiet, Liddy Allen.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so we sat there until morning, wondering if the candle would last\r\nuntil dawn, and arranging what trains we could take back to town.  If\r\nwe had only stuck to that decision and gone back before it was too late!\r\n\r\nThe sun came finally, and from my window I watched the trees along the\r\ndrive take shadowy form, gradually lose their ghostlike appearance,\r\nbecome gray and then green.  The Greenwood Club showed itself a dab of\r\nwhite against the hill across the valley, and an early robin or two\r\nhopped around in the dew.  Not until the milk-boy and the sun came,\r\nabout the same time, did I dare to open the door into the hall and look\r\naround.  Everything was as we had left it.  Trunks were heaped here and\r\nthere, ready for the trunk-room, and through an end window of stained\r\nglass came a streak of red and yellow daylight that was eminently\r\ncheerful. The milk-boy was pounding somewhere below, and the day had\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nThomas Johnson came ambling up the drive about half-past six, and we\r\ncould hear him clattering around on the lower floor, opening shutters.\r\nI had to take Liddy to her room up-stairs, however,--she was quite sure\r\nshe would find something uncanny. In fact, when she did not, having now\r\nthe courage of daylight, she was actually disappointed.\r\n\r\nWell, we did not go back to town that day.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of a small picture fallen from the wall of the\r\ndrawing-room was quite sufficient to satisfy Liddy that the alarm had\r\nbeen a false one, but I was anything but convinced.  Allowing for my\r\nnerves and the fact that small noises magnify themselves at night,\r\nthere was still no possibility that the picture had made the series of\r\nsounds I heard.  To prove it, however, I dropped it again.  It fell\r\nwith a single muffled crash of its wooden frame, and incidentally\r\nruined itself beyond repair.  I justified myself by reflecting that if\r\nthe Armstrongs chose to leave pictures in unsafe positions, and to rent\r\na house with a family ghost, the destruction of property was their\r\nresponsibility, not mine.\r\n\r\nI warned Liddy not to mention what had happened to anybody, and\r\ntelephoned to town for servants.  Then after a breakfast which did more\r\ncredit to Thomas' heart than his head, I went on a short tour of\r\ninvestigation.  The sounds had come from the east wing, and not without\r\nsome qualms I began there.  At first I found nothing.  Since then I\r\nhave developed my powers of observation, but at that time I was a\r\nnovice.  The small card-room seemed undisturbed.  I looked for\r\nfootprints, which is, I believe, the conventional thing to do, although\r\nmy experience has been that as clues both footprints and thumb-marks\r\nare more useful in fiction than in fact.  But the stairs in that wing\r\noffered something.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the flight had been placed a tall wicker hamper, packed,\r\nwith linen that had come from town.  It stood at the edge of the top\r\nstep, almost barring passage, and on the step below it was a long fresh\r\nscratch.  For three steps the scratch was repeated, gradually\r\ndiminishing, as if some object had fallen, striking each one.  Then for\r\nfour steps nothing.  On the fifth step below was a round dent in the\r\nhard wood.  That was all, and it seemed little enough, except that I\r\nwas positive the marks had not been there the day before.\r\n\r\nIt bore out my theory of the sound, which had been for all the world\r\nlike the bumping of a metallic object down a flight of steps.  The four\r\nsteps had been skipped.  I reasoned that an iron bar, for instance,\r\nwould do something of the sort,--strike two or three steps, end down,\r\nthen turn over, jumping a few stairs, and landing with a thud.\r\n\r\nIron bars, however, do not fall down-stairs in the middle of the night\r\nalone.  Coupled with the figure on the veranda the agency by which it\r\nclimbed might be assumed.  But--and here was the thing that puzzled me\r\nmost--the doors were all fastened that morning, the windows unmolested,\r\nand the particular door from the card-room to the veranda had a\r\ncombination lock of which I held the key, and which had not been\r\ntampered with.\r\n\r\nI fixed on an attempt at burglary, as the most natural explanation--an\r\nattempt frustrated by the falling of the object, whatever it was, that\r\nhad roused me.  Two things I could not understand: how the intruder had\r\nescaped with everything locked, and why he had left the small silver,\r\nwhich, in the absence of a butler, had remained down-stairs over night.\r\n\r\nUnder pretext of learning more about the place, Thomas Johnson led me\r\nthrough the house and the cellars, without result. Everything was in\r\ngood order and repair; money had been spent lavishly on construction\r\nand plumbing.  The house was full of conveniences, and I had no reason\r\nto repent my bargain, save the fact that, in the nature of things,\r\nnight must come again. And other nights must follow--and we were a long\r\nway from a police-station.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon a hack came up from Casanova, with a fresh relay of\r\nservants.  The driver took them with a flourish to the servants'\r\nentrance, and drove around to the front of the house, where I was\r\nawaiting him.\r\n\r\n\"Two dollars,\" he said in reply to my question.  \"I don't charge full\r\nrates, because, bringin' 'em up all summer as I do, it pays to make a\r\nspecial price.  When they got off the train, I sez, sez I, 'There's\r\nanother bunch for Sunnyside, cook, parlor maid and all.'  Yes'm--six\r\nsummers, and a new lot never less than once a month.  They won't stand\r\nfor the country and the lonesomeness, I reckon.\"\r\n\r\nBut with the presence of the \"bunch\" of servants my courage revived,\r\nand late in the afternoon came a message from Gertrude that she and\r\nHalsey would arrive that night at about eleven o'clock, coming in the\r\ncar from Richfield.  Things were looking up; and when Beulah, my cat, a\r\nmost intelligent animal, found some early catnip on a bank near the\r\nhouse and rolled in it in a feline ecstasy, I decided that getting back\r\nto nature was the thing to do.\r\n\r\nWhile I was dressing for dinner, Liddy rapped at the door.  She was\r\nhardly herself yet, but privately I think she was worrying about the\r\nbroken mirror and its augury, more than anything else. When she came in\r\nshe was holding something in her hand, and she laid it on the\r\ndressing-table carefully.\r\n\r\n\"I found it in the linen hamper,\" she said.  \"It must be Mr. Halsey's,\r\nbut it seems queer how it got there.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the half of a link cuff-button of unique design, and I looked at\r\nit carefully.\r\n\r\n\"Where was it?  In the bottom of the hamper?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"On the very top,\" she replied.  \"It's a mercy it didn't fall out on\r\nthe way.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Liddy had gone I examined the fragment attentively.  I had never\r\nseen it before, and I was certain it was not Halsey's.  It was of\r\nItalian workmanship, and consisted of a mother-of-pearl foundation,\r\nencrusted with tiny seed-pearls, strung on horsehair to hold them.  In\r\nthe center was a small ruby.  The trinket was odd enough, but not\r\nintrinsically of great value.  Its interest for me lay in this:  Liddy\r\nhad found it lying in the top of the hamper which had blocked the\r\neast-wing stairs.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon the Armstrongs' housekeeper, a youngish good-looking\r\nwoman, applied for Mrs. Ralston's place, and I was glad enough to take\r\nher.  She looked as though she might be equal to a dozen of Liddy, with\r\nher snapping black eyes and heavy jaw.  Her name was Anne Watson, and I\r\ndined that evening for the first time in three days.\r\n\nI had dinner served in the breakfast-room.  Somehow the huge\r\ndining-room depressed me, and Thomas, cheerful enough all day, allowed\r\nhis spirits to go down with the sun.  He had a habit of watching the\r\ncorners of the room, left shadowy by the candles on the table, and\r\naltogether it was not a festive meal.\r\n\r\nDinner over I went into the living-room.  I had three hours before the\r\nchildren could possibly arrive, and I got out my knitting.  I had\r\nbrought along two dozen pairs of slipper soles in assorted sizes--I\r\nalways send knitted slippers to the Old Ladies' Home at Christmas--and\r\nnow I sorted over the wools with a grim determination not to think\r\nabout the night before.  But my mind was not on my work: at the end of\r\na half-hour I found I had put a row of blue scallops on Eliza\r\nKlinefelter's lavender slippers, and I put them away.\r\n\r\nI got out the cuff-link and went with it to the pantry.  Thomas was\r\nwiping silver and the air was heavy with tobacco smoke.  I sniffed and\r\nlooked around, but there was no pipe to be seen.\r\n\r\n\"Thomas,\" I said, \"you have been smoking.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, ma'm.\"  He was injured innocence itself.  \"It's on my coat, ma'm.\r\nOver at the club the gentlemen--\"\r\n\r\nBut Thomas did not finish.  The pantry was suddenly filled with the\r\nodor of singeing cloth.  Thomas gave a clutch at his coat, whirled to\r\nthe sink, filled a tumbler with water and poured it into his right\r\npocket with the celerity of practice.\r\n\r\n\"Thomas,\" I said, when he was sheepishly mopping the floor, \"smoking is\r\na filthy and injurious habit.  If you must smoke, you must; but don't\r\nstick a lighted pipe in your pocket again.  Your skin's your own: you\r\ncan blister it if you like.  But this house is not mine, and I don't\r\nwant a conflagration.  Did you ever see this cuff-link before?\"\r\n\r\nNo, he never had, he said, but he looked at it oddly.\r\n\r\n\"I picked it up in the hall,\" I added indifferently.  The old man's\r\neyes were shrewd under his bushy eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\"There's strange goin's-on here, Mis' Innes,\" he said, shaking his\r\nhead.  \"Somethin's goin' to happen, sure.  You ain't took notice that\r\nthe big clock in the hall is stopped, I reckon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" I said.  \"Clocks have to stop, don't they, if they're not\r\nwound?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's wound up, all right, and it stopped at three o'clock last night,\"\r\nhe answered solemnly.  \"More'n that, that there clock ain't stopped for\r\nfifteen years, not since Mr. Armstrong's first wife died.  And that\r\nain't all,--no MA'M.  Last three nights I slep' in this place, after\r\nthe electrics went out I had a token. My oil lamp was full of oil, but\r\nit kep' goin' out, do what I would.  Minute I shet my eyes, out that\r\nlamp'd go.  There ain't no surer token of death.  The Bible sez, LET\r\nYER LIGHT SHINE! When a hand you can't see puts yer light out, it means\r\ndeath, sure.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man's voice was full of conviction.  In spite of myself I had a\r\nchilly sensation in the small of my back, and I left him mumbling over\r\nhis dishes.  Later on I heard a crash from the pantry, and Liddy\r\nreported that Beulah, who is coal black, had darted in front of Thomas\r\njust as he picked up a tray of dishes; that the bad omen had been too\r\nmuch for him, and he had dropped the tray.\r\n\r\nThe chug of the automobile as it climbed the hill was the most welcome\r\nsound I had heard for a long time, and with Gertrude and Halsey\r\nactually before me, my troubles seemed over for good. Gertrude stood\r\nsmiling in the hall, with her hat quite over one ear, and her hair in\r\nevery direction under her pink veil. Gertrude is a very pretty girl, no\r\nmatter how her hat is, and I was not surprised when Halsey presented a\r\ngood-looking young man, who bowed at me and looked at Trude--that is\r\nthe ridiculous nickname Gertrude brought from school.\r\n\r\n\"I have brought a guest, Aunt Ray,\" Halsey said.  \"I want you to adopt\r\nhim into your affections and your Saturday-to-Monday list. Let me\r\npresent John Bailey, only you must call him Jack.  In twelve hours\r\nhe'll be calling you 'Aunt': I know him.\"\r\n\r\nWe shook hands, and I got a chance to look at Mr. Bailey; he was a tall\r\nfellow, perhaps thirty, and he wore a small mustache.  I remember\r\nwondering why: he seemed to have a good mouth and when he smiled his\r\nteeth were above the average.  One never knows why certain men cling to\r\na messy upper lip that must get into things, any more than one\r\nunderstands some women building up their hair on wire atrocities.\r\nOtherwise, he was very good to look at, stalwart and tanned, with the\r\ndirect gaze that I like. I am particular about Mr. Bailey, because he\r\nwas a prominent figure in what happened later.\r\n\r\nGertrude was tired with the trip and went up to bed very soon.  I made\r\nup my mind to tell them nothing; until the next day, and then to make\r\nas light of our excitement as possible.  After all, what had I to tell?\r\nAn inquisitive face peering in at a window; a crash in the night; a\r\nscratch or two on the stairs, and half a cuff-button!  As for Thomas\r\nand his forebodings, it was always my belief that a negro is one part\r\nthief, one part pigment, and the rest superstition.\r\n\r\nIt was Saturday night.  The two men went to the billiard-room, and I\r\ncould hear them talking as I went up-stairs.  It seemed that Halsey had\r\nstopped at the Greenwood Club for gasolene and found Jack Bailey there,\r\nwith the Sunday golf crowd.  Mr. Bailey had not been hard to\r\npersuade--probably Gertrude knew why--and they had carried him off\r\ntriumphantly.  I roused Liddy to get them something to eat--Thomas was\r\nbeyond reach in the lodge--and paid no attention to her evident terror\r\nof the kitchen regions.  Then I went to bed.  The men were still in the\r\nbilliard-room when I finally dozed off, and the last thing I remember\r\nwas the howl of a dog in front of the house.  It wailed a crescendo of\r\nwoe that trailed off hopefully, only to break out afresh from a new\r\npoint of the compass.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock in the morning I was roused by a revolver shot. The\r\nsound seemed to come from just outside my door.  For a moment I could\r\nnot move.  Then--I heard Gertrude stirring in her room, and the next\r\nmoment she had thrown open the connecting door.\r\n\r\n\"O Aunt Ray!  Aunt Ray!\" she cried hysterically.  \"Some one has been\r\nkilled, killed!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thieves,\" I said shortly.  \"Thank goodness, there are some men in the\r\nhouse to-night.\"  I was getting into my slippers and a bath-robe, and\r\nGertrude with shaking hands was lighting a lamp. Then we opened the\r\ndoor into the hall, where, crowded on the upper landing of the stairs,\r\nthe maids, white-faced and trembling, were peering down, headed by\r\nLiddy.  I was greeted by a series of low screams and questions, and I\r\ntried to quiet them.\r\n\r\nGertrude had dropped on a chair and sat there limp and shivering.\r\n\r\nI went at once across the hall to Halsey's room and knocked; then I\r\npushed the door open.  It was empty; the bed had not been occupied!\r\n\r\n\"He must be in Mr. Bailey's room,\" I said excitedly, and followed by\r\nLiddy, we went there.  Like Halsey's, it had not been occupied!\r\nGertrude was on her feet now, but she leaned against the door for\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\"They have been killed!\" she gasped.  Then she caught me by the arm and\r\ndragged me toward the stairs.  \"They may only be hurt, and we must find\r\nthem,\" she said, her eyes dilated with excitement.\r\n\r\nI don't remember how we got down the stairs: I do remember expecting\r\nevery moment to be killed.  The cook was at the telephone up-stairs,\r\ncalling the Greenwood Club, and Liddy was behind me, afraid to come and\r\nnot daring to stay behind.  We found the living-room and the\r\ndrawing-room undisturbed.  Somehow I felt that whatever we found would\r\nbe in the card-room or on the staircase, and nothing but the fear that\r\nHalsey was in danger drove me on; with every step my knees seemed to\r\ngive way under me.  Gertrude was ahead and in the card-room she\r\nstopped, holding her candle high.  Then she pointed silently to the\r\ndoorway into the hall beyond.  Huddled there on the floor, face down,\r\nwith his arms extended, was a man.\r\n\r\nGertrude ran forward with a gasping sob.  \"Jack,\" she cried, \"oh, Jack!\"\r\n\r\nLiddy had run, screaming, and the two of us were there alone.  It was\r\nGertrude who turned him over, finally, until we could see his white\r\nface, and then she drew a deep breath and dropped limply to her knees.\r\nIt was the body of a man, a gentleman, in a dinner coat and white\r\nwaistcoat, stained now with blood--the body of a man I had never seen\r\nbefore.\r\n\nGertrude gazed at the face in a kind of fascination.  Then she put out\r\nher hands blindly, and I thought she was going to faint.\r\n\r\n\"He has killed him!\"  she muttered almost inarticulately; and at that,\r\nbecause my nerves were going, I gave her a good shake.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" I said frantically.  There was a depth of grief and\r\nconviction in her tone that was worse than anything she could have\r\nsaid.  The shake braced her, anyhow, and she seemed to pull herself\r\ntogether.  But not another word would she say: she stood gazing down at\r\nthat gruesome figure on the floor, while Liddy, ashamed of her flight\r\nand afraid to come back alone, drove before her three terrified\r\nwomen-servants into the drawing-room, which was as near as any of them\r\nwould venture.\r\n\r\nOnce in the drawing-room, Gertrude collapsed and went from one fainting\r\nspell into another.  I had all I could do to keep Liddy from drowning\r\nher with cold water, and the maids huddled in a corner, as much use as\r\nso many sheep.  In a short time, although it seemed hours, a car came\r\nrushing up, and Anne Watson, who had waited to dress, opened the door.\r\nThree men from the Greenwood Club, in all kinds of costumes, hurried\r\nin.  I recognized a Mr. Jarvis, but the others were strangers.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong?\" the Jarvis man asked--and we made a strange picture, no\r\ndoubt.  \"Nobody hurt, is there?\"  He was looking at Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\"Worse than that, Mr. Jarvis,\" I said.  \"I think it is murder.\"\r\n\r\nAt the word there was a commotion.  The cook began to cry, and Mrs.\r\nWatson knocked over a chair.  The men were visibly impressed.\r\n\r\n\"Not any member of the family?\" Mr. Jarvis asked, when he had got his\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said; and motioning Liddy to look after Gertrude, I led the way\r\nwith a lamp to the card-room door.  One of the men gave an exclamation,\r\nand they all hurried across the room.  Mr. Jarvis took the lamp from\r\nme--I remember that--and then, feeling myself getting dizzy and\r\nlight-headed, I closed my eyes.  When I opened them their brief\r\nexamination was over, and Mr. Jarvis was trying to put me in a chair.\r\n\r\n\"You must get up-stairs,\" he said firmly, \"you and Miss Gertrude, too.\r\nThis has been a terrible shock.  In his own home, too.\"\r\n\r\nI stared at him without comprehension.  \"Who is it?\" I asked with\r\ndifficulty.  There was a band drawn tight around my throat.\r\n\r\n\"It is Arnold Armstrong,\" he said, looking at me oddly, \"and he has\r\nbeen murdered in his father's house.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a minute I gathered myself together and Mr. Jarvis helped me into\r\nthe living-room.  Liddy had got Gertrude up-stairs, and the two strange\r\nmen from the club stayed with the body.  The reaction from the shock\r\nand strain was tremendous: I was collapsed--and then Mr. Jarvis asked\r\nme a question that brought back my wandering faculties.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Halsey?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Halsey!\"  Suddenly Gertrude's stricken face rose before me the empty\r\nrooms up-stairs.  Where was Halsey?\r\n\r\n\"He was here, wasn't he?\" Mr. Jarvis persisted.  \"He stopped at the\r\nclub on his way over.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--don't know where he is,\" I said feebly.\r\n\r\nOne of the men from the club came in, asked for the telephone, and I\r\ncould hear him excitedly talking, saying something about coroners and\r\ndetectives.  Mr. Jarvis leaned over to me.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you trust me, Miss Innes?\" he said.  \"If I can do anything I\r\nwill.  But tell me the whole thing.\"\r\n\r\nI did, finally, from the beginning, and when I told of Jack Bailey's\r\nbeing in the house that night, he gave a long whistle.\r\n\r\n\"I wish they were both here,\" he said when I finished.  \"Whatever mad\r\nprank took them away, it would look better if they were here.\r\nEspecially--\"\r\n\r\n\"Especially what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Especially since Jack Bailey and Arnold Armstrong were notoriously bad\r\nfriends.  It was Bailey who got Arnold into trouble last\r\nspring--something about the bank.  And then, too--\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" I said.  \"If there is anything more, I ought to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing more,\" he said evasively.  \"There's just one thing we\r\nmay bank on, Miss Innes.  Any court in the country will acquit a man\r\nwho kills an intruder in his house, at night.  If Halsey--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you don't think Halsey did it!\" I exclaimed.  There was a queer\r\nfeeling of physical nausea coming over me.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, not at all,\" he said with forced cheerfulness.  \"Come, Miss\r\nInnes, you're a ghost of yourself and I am going to help you up-stairs\r\nand call your maid.  This has been too much for you.\"\r\n\r\nLiddy helped me back to bed, and under the impression that I was in\r\ndanger of freezing to death, put a hot-water bottle over my heart and\r\nanother at my feet.  Then she left me.  It was early dawn now, and from\r\nvoices under my window I surmised that Mr. Jarvis and his companions\r\nwere searching the grounds.  As for me, I lay in bed, with every\r\nfaculty awake.  Where had Halsey gone? How had he gone, and when?\r\nBefore the murder, no doubt, but who would believe that?  If either he\r\nor Jack Bailey had heard an intruder in the house and shot him--as they\r\nmight have been justified in doing--why had they run away?  The whole\r\nthing was unheard of, outrageous, and--impossible to ignore.\r\n\r\nAbout six o'clock Gertrude came in.  She was fully dressed, and I sat\r\nup nervously.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Aunty!\" she said.  \"What a shocking night you have had!\" She came\r\nover and sat down on the bed, and I saw she looked very tired and worn.\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything new?\" I asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.  The car is gone, but Warner\"--he is the chauffeur--\"Warner\r\nis at the lodge and knows nothing about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I said, \"if I ever get my hands on Halsey Innes, I shall not\r\nlet go until I have told him a few things.  When we get this cleared\r\nup, I am going back to the city to be quiet.  One more night like the\r\nlast two will end me.  The peace of the country--fiddle sticks!\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon I told Gertrude of the noises the night before, and the\r\nfigure on the veranda in the east wing.  As an afterthought I brought\r\nout the pearl cuff-link.\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt now,\" I said, \"that it was Arnold Armstrong the night\r\nbefore last, too.  He had a key, no doubt, but why he should steal into\r\nhis father's house I can not imagine.  He could have come with my\r\npermission, easily enough.  Anyhow, whoever it was that night, left\r\nthis little souvenir.\"\r\n\r\nGertrude took one look at the cuff-link, and went as white as the\r\npearls in it; she clutched at the foot of the bed, and stood staring.\r\nAs for me, I was quite as astonished as she was.\r\n\r\n\"Where did--you--find it?\" she asked finally, with a desperate effort\r\nat calm.  And while I told her she stood looking out of the window with\r\na look I could not fathom on her face.  It was a relief when Mrs.\r\nWatson tapped at the door and brought me some tea and toast.  The cook\r\nwas in bed, completely demoralized, she reported, and Liddy, brave with\r\nthe daylight, was looking for footprints around the house.  Mrs. Watson\r\nherself was a wreck; she was blue-white around the lips, and she had\r\none hand tied up.\r\n\r\nShe said she had fallen down-stairs in her excitement.  It was natural,\r\nof course, that the thing would shock her, having been the Armstrongs'\r\nhousekeeper for several years, and knowing Mr. Arnold well.\r\n\r\nGertrude had slipped out during my talk with Mrs. Watson, and I dressed\r\nand went down-stairs.  The billiard and card-rooms were locked until\r\nthe coroner and the detectives got there, and the men from the club had\r\ngone back for more conventional clothing.\r\n\r\nI could hear Thomas in the pantry, alternately wailing for Mr. Arnold,\r\nas he called him, and citing the tokens that had precursed the murder.\r\nThe house seemed to choke me, and, slipping a shawl around me, I went\r\nout on the drive.  At the corner by the east wing I met Liddy.  Her\r\nskirts were draggled with dew to her knees, and her hair was still in\r\ncrimps.\r\n\r\n\"Go right in and change your clothes,\" I said sharply.  \"You're a\r\nsight, and at your age!\"\r\n\r\nShe had a golf-stick in her hand, and she said she had found it on the\r\nlawn.  There was nothing unusual about it, but it occurred to me that a\r\ngolf-stick with a metal end might have been the object that had\r\nscratched the stairs near the card-room.  I took it from her, and sent\r\nher up for dry garments.  Her daylight courage and self-importance, and\r\nher shuddering delight in the mystery, irritated me beyond words.\r\nAfter I left her I made a circuit of the building.  Nothing seemed to\r\nbe disturbed: the house looked as calm and peaceful in the morning sun\r\nas it had the day I had been coerced into taking it.  There was nothing\r\nto show that inside had been mystery and violence and sudden death.\r\n\r\nIn one of the tulip beds back of the house an early blackbird was\r\npecking viciously at something that glittered in the light. I picked my\r\nway gingerly over through the dew and stooped down: almost buried in\r\nthe soft ground was a revolver!  I scraped the earth off it with the\r\ntip of my shoe, and, picking it up, slipped it into my pocket.  Not\r\nuntil I had got into my bedroom and double-locked the door did I\r\nventure to take it out and examine it.  One look was all I needed.  It\r\nwas Halsey's revolver.  I had unpacked it the day before and put it on\r\nhis shaving-stand, and there could be no mistake.  His name was on a\r\nsmall silver plate on the handle.\r\n\r\nI seemed to see a network closing around my boy, innocent as I knew he\r\nwas.  The revolver--I am afraid of them, but anxiety gave me courage to\r\nlook through the barrel--the revolver had still two bullets in it.  I\r\ncould only breathe a prayer of thankfulness that I had found the\r\nrevolver before any sharp-eyed detective had come around.\r\n\r\nI decided to keep what clues I had, the cuff-link, the golf-stick and\r\nthe revolver, in a secure place until I could see some reason for\r\ndisplaying them.  The cuff-link had been dropped into a little filigree\r\nbox on my toilet table.  I opened the box and felt around for it.  The\r\nbox was empty--the cuff-link had disappeared!\r\n\nAt ten o'clock the Casanova hack brought up three men.  They introduced\r\nthemselves as the coroner of the county and two detectives from the\r\ncity.  The coroner led the way at once to the locked wing, and with the\r\naid of one of the detectives examined the rooms and the body.  The\r\nother detective, after a short scrutiny of the dead man, busied himself\r\nwith the outside of the house.  It was only after they had got a fair\r\nidea of things as they were that they sent for me.\r\n\r\nI received them in the living-room, and I had made up my mind exactly\r\nwhat to tell.  I had taken the house for the summer, I said, while the\r\nArmstrongs were in California.  In spite of a rumor among the servants\r\nabout strange noises--I cited Thomas--nothing had occurred the first\r\ntwo nights.  On the third night I believed that some one had been in\r\nthe house: I had heard a crashing sound, but being alone with one maid\r\nhad not investigated.  The house had been locked in the morning and\r\napparently undisturbed.\r\n\r\nThen, as clearly as I could, I related how, the night before, a shot\r\nhad roused us; that my niece and I had investigated and found a body;\r\nthat I did not know who the murdered man was until Mr. Jarvis from the\r\nclub informed me, and that I knew of no reason why Mr. Arnold Armstrong\r\nshould steal into his father's house at night.  I should have been glad\r\nto allow him entree there at any time.\r\n\r\n\"Have you reason to believe, Miss Innes,\" the coroner asked, \"that any\r\nmember of your household, imagining Mr. Armstrong was a burglar, shot\r\nhim in self-defense?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no reason for thinking so,\" I said quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Your theory is that Mr. Armstrong was followed here by some enemy, and\r\nshot as he entered the house?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I have a theory,\" I said.  \"The thing that has puzzled\r\nme is why Mr. Armstrong should enter his father's house two nights in\r\nsuccession, stealing in like a thief, when he needed only to ask\r\nentrance to be admitted.\"\r\n\r\nThe coroner was a very silent man: he took some notes after this, but\r\nhe seemed anxious to make the next train back to town.  He set the\r\ninquest for the following Saturday, gave Mr. Jamieson, the younger of\r\nthe two detectives, and the more intelligent looking, a few\r\ninstructions, and, after gravely shaking hands with me and regretting\r\nthe unfortunate affair, took his departure, accompanied by the other\r\ndetective.\r\n\r\nI was just beginning to breathe freely when Mr. Jamieson, who had been\r\nstanding by the window, came over to me.\r\n\r\n\"The family consists of yourself alone, Miss Innes?\"\r\n\r\n\"My niece is here,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"There is no one but yourself and your niece?\"\r\n\r\n\"My nephew.\"  I had to moisten my lips.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, a nephew.  I should like to see him, if he is here.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is not here just now,\" I said as quietly as I could.  \"I expect\r\nhim--at any time.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was here yesterday evening, I believe?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't he have a guest with him?  Another man?\"\r\n\r\n\"He brought a friend with him to stay over Sunday, Mr. Bailey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. John Bailey, the cashier of the Traders' Bank I believe.\" And I\r\nknew that some one at the Greenwood Club had told.  \"When did they\r\nleave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very early--I don't know at just what time.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson turned suddenly and looked at me.\r\n\r\n\"Please try to be more explicit,\" he said.  \"You say your nephew and\r\nMr. Bailey were in the house last night, and yet you and your niece,\r\nwith some women-servants, found the body.  Where was your nephew?\"\r\n\r\nI was entirely desperate by that time.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" I cried, \"but be sure of this: Halsey knows nothing of\r\nthis thing, and no amount of circumstantial evidence can make an\r\ninnocent man guilty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit down,\" he said, pushing forward a chair.  \"There are some things I\r\nhave to tell you, and, in return, please tell me all you know.  Believe\r\nme, things always come out.  In the first place, Mr. Armstrong was shot\r\nfrom above.  The bullet was fired at close range, entered below the\r\nshoulder and came out, after passing through the heart, well down the\r\nback.  In other words, I believe the murderer stood on the stairs and\r\nfired down.  In the second place, I found on the edge of the\r\nbilliard-table a charred cigar which had burned itself partly out, and\r\na cigarette which had consumed itself to the cork tip.  Neither one had\r\nbeen more than lighted, then put down and forgotten.  Have you any idea\r\nwhat it was that made your nephew and Mr. Bailey leave their cigars and\r\ntheir game, take out the automobile without calling the chauffeur, and\r\nall this at--let me see certainly before three o'clock in the morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" I said; \"but depend on it, Mr. Jamieson, Halsey will be\r\nback himself to explain everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"I sincerely hope so,\" he said.  \"Miss Innes, has it occurred to you\r\nthat Mr. Bailey might know something of this?\"\r\n\r\nGertrude had come down-stairs and just as he spoke she came in. I saw\r\nher stop suddenly, as if she had been struck.\r\n\r\n\"He does not,\" she said in a tone that was not her own.  \"Mr. Bailey\r\nand my brother know nothing of this.  The murder was committed at\r\nthree.  They left the house at a quarter before three.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that?\" Mr. Jamieson asked oddly.  \"Do you KNOW at what\r\ntime they left?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" Gertrude answered firmly.  \"At a quarter before three my\r\nbrother and Mr. Bailey left the house, by the main entrance.\r\nI--was--there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gertrude,\" I said excitedly, \"you are dreaming!  Why, at a quarter to\r\nthree--\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" she said.  \"At half-past two the downstairs telephone rang.\r\nI had not gone to sleep, and I heard it.  Then I heard Halsey answer\r\nit, and in a few minutes he came up-stairs and knocked at my door.\r\nWe--we talked for a minute, then I put on my dressing-gown and\r\nslippers, and went down-stairs with him.  Mr. Bailey was in the\r\nbilliard-room.  We--we all talked together for perhaps ten minutes.\r\nThen it was decided that--that they should both go away--\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you be more explicit?\" Mr. Jamieson asked.  \"WHY did they go\r\naway?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am only telling you what happened, not why it happened,\" she said\r\nevenly.  \"Halsey went for the car, and instead of bringing it to the\r\nhouse and rousing people, he went by the lower road from the stable.\r\nMr. Bailey was to meet him at the foot of the lawn.  Mr. Bailey left--\"\r\n\r\n\"Which way?\" Mr. Jamieson asked sharply.\r\n\r\n\"By the main entrance.  He left--it was a quarter to three.  I know\r\nexactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"The clock in the hall is stopped, Miss Innes,\" said Jamieson. Nothing\r\nseemed to escape him.\r\n\r\n\"He looked at his watch,\" she replied, and I could see Mr. Jamieson's\r\nsnap, as if he had made a discovery.  As for myself, during the whole\r\nrecital I had been plunged into the deepest amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Will you pardon me for a personal question?\"  The detective was a\r\nyoungish man, and I thought he was somewhat embarrassed.  \"What are\r\nyour--your relations with Mr. Bailey?\"\r\n\r\nGertrude hesitated.  Then she came over and put her hand lovingly in\r\nmine.\r\n\r\n\"I am engaged to marry him,\" she said simply.\r\n\r\nI had grown so accustomed to surprises that I could only gasp again,\r\nand as for Gertrude, the hand that lay in mine was burning with fever.\r\n\r\n\"And--after that,\" Mr. Jamieson went on, \"you went directly to bed?\"\r\n\r\nGertrude hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said finally.  \"I--I am not nervous, and after I had\r\nextinguished the light, I remembered something I had left in the\r\nbilliard-room, and I felt my way back there through the darkness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you tell me what it was you had forgotten?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can not tell you,\" she said slowly.  \"I--I did not leave the\r\nbilliard-room at once--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"  The detective's tone was imperative.  \"This is very important,\r\nMiss Innes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was crying,\" Gertrude said in a low tone.  \"When the French clock in\r\nthe drawing-room struck three, I got up, and then--I heard a step on\r\nthe east porch, just outside the card-room.  Some one with a key was\r\nworking with the latch, and I thought, of course, of Halsey.  When we\r\ntook the house he called that his entrance, and he had carried a key\r\nfor it ever since.  The door opened and I was about to ask what he had\r\nforgotten, when there was a flash and a report.  Some heavy body\r\ndropped, and, half crazed with terror and shock, I ran through the\r\ndrawing-room and got up-stairs--I scarcely remember how.\"\r\n\r\nShe dropped into a chair, and I thought Mr. Jamieson must have\r\nfinished.  But he was not through.\r\n\r\n\"You certainly clear your brother and Mr. Bailey admirably,\" he said.\r\n\"The testimony is invaluable, especially in view of the fact that your\r\nbrother and Mr. Armstrong had, I believe, quarreled rather seriously\r\nsome time ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" I broke in.  \"Things are bad enough, Mr. Jamieson, without\r\ninventing bad feeling where it doesn't exist.  Gertrude, I don't think\r\nHalsey knew the--the murdered man, did he?\"\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Jamieson was sure of his ground.\r\n\r\n\"The quarrel, I believe,\" he persisted, \"was about Mr. Armstrong's\r\nconduct to you, Miss Gertrude.  He had been paying you unwelcome\r\nattentions.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I had never seen the man!\r\n\r\nWhen she nodded a \"yes\" I saw the tremendous possibilities involved.\r\nIf this detective could prove that Gertrude feared and disliked the\r\nmurdered man, and that Mr. Armstrong had been annoying and possibly\r\npursuing her with hateful attentions, all that, added to Gertrude's\r\nconfession of her presence in the billiard-room at the time of the\r\ncrime, looked strange, to say the least.  The prominence of the family\r\nassured a strenuous effort to find the murderer, and if we had nothing\r\nworse to look forward to, we were sure of a distasteful publicity.\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson shut his note-book with a snap, and thanked us.\r\n\r\n\"I have an idea,\" he said, apropos of nothing at all, \"that at any rate\r\nthe ghost is laid here.  Whatever the rappings have been--and the\r\ncolored man says they began when the family went west three months\r\nago--they are likely to stop now.\"\r\n\r\nWhich shows how much he knew about it.  The ghost was not laid: with\r\nthe murder of Arnold Armstrong he, or it, only seemed to take on fresh\r\nvigor.\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson left then, and when Gertrude had gone up-stairs, as she\r\ndid at once, I sat and thought over what I had just heard. Her\r\nengagement, once so engrossing a matter, paled now beside the\r\nsignificance of her story.  If Halsey and Jack Bailey had left before\r\nthe crime, how came Halsey's revolver in the tulip bed? What was the\r\nmysterious cause of their sudden flight?  What had Gertrude left in the\r\nbilliard-room?  What was the significance of the cuff-link, and where\r\nwas it?\r\n\nWhen the detective left he enjoined absolute secrecy on everybody in\r\nthe household.  The Greenwood Club promised the same thing, and as\r\nthere are no Sunday afternoon papers, the murder was not publicly known\r\nuntil Monday.  The coroner himself notified the Armstrong family\r\nlawyer, and early in the afternoon he came out. I had not seen Mr.\r\nJamieson since morning, but I knew he had been interrogating the\r\nservants.  Gertrude was locked in her room with a headache, and I had\r\nluncheon alone.\r\n\r\nMr. Harton, the lawyer, was a little, thin man, and he looked as if he\r\ndid not relish his business that day.\r\n\r\n\"This is very unfortunate, Miss Innes,\" he said, after we had shaken\r\nhands.  \"Most unfortunate--and mysterious.  With the father and mother\r\nin the west, I find everything devolves on me; and, as you can\r\nunderstand, it is an unpleasant duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt,\" I said absently.  \"Mr. Harton, I am going to ask you some\r\nquestions, and I hope you will answer them.  I feel that I am entitled\r\nto some knowledge, because I and my family are just now in a most\r\nambiguous position.\"\r\n\r\nI don't know whether he understood me or not: he took of his glasses\r\nand wiped them.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be very happy,\" he said with old-fashioned courtesy.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you.  Mr. Harton, did Mr. Arnold Armstrong know that Sunnyside\r\nhad been rented?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think--yes, he did.  In fact, I myself told him about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he knew who the tenants were?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"He had not been living with the family for some years, I believe?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.  Unfortunately, there had been trouble between Arnold and his\r\nfather.  For two years he had lived in town.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it would be unlikely that he came here last night to get\r\npossession of anything belonging to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think it hardly possible,\" he admitted.\r\n\r\n\"To be perfectly frank, Miss Innes, I can not think of any reason\r\nwhatever for his coming here as he did.  He had been staying at the\r\nclub-house across the valley for the last week, Jarvis tells me, but\r\nthat only explains how he came here, not why.  It is a most unfortunate\r\nfamily.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head despondently, and I felt that this dried-up little\r\nman was the repository of much that he had not told me.  I gave up\r\ntrying to elicit any information from him, and we went together to view\r\nthe body before it was taken to the city.  It had been lifted on to the\r\nbilliard-table and a sheet thrown over it; otherwise nothing had been\r\ntouched.  A soft hat lay beside it, and the collar of the dinner-coat\r\nwas still turned up.  The handsome, dissipated face of Arnold\r\nArmstrong, purged of its ugly lines, was now only pathetic.  As we went\r\nin Mrs. Watson appeared at the card-room door.\r\n\r\n\"Come in, Mrs. Watson,\" the lawyer said.  But she shook her head and\r\nwithdrew: she was the only one in the house who seemed to regret the\r\ndead man, and even she seemed rather shocked than sorry.\r\n\r\nI went to the door at the foot of the circular staircase and opened it.\r\nIf I could only have seen Halsey coming at his usual hare-brained clip\r\nup the drive, if I could have heard the throb of the motor, I would\r\nhave felt that my troubles were over.\r\n\r\nBut there was nothing to be seen.  The countryside lay sunny and quiet\r\nin its peaceful Sunday afternoon calm, and far down the drive Mr.\r\nJamieson was walking slowly, stooping now and then, as if to examine\r\nthe road.  When I went back, Mr. Harton was furtively wiping his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"The prodigal has come home, Miss Innes,\" he said.  \"How often the sins\r\nof the fathers are visited on the children!\"  Which left me pondering.\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Harton left, he told me something of the Armstrong family.\r\nPaul Armstrong, the father, had been married twice. Arnold was a son by\r\nthe first marriage.  The second Mrs. Armstrong had been a widow, with a\r\nchild, a little girl.  This child, now perhaps twenty, was Louise\r\nArmstrong, having taken her stepfather's name, and was at present in\r\nCalifornia with the family.\r\n\r\n\"They will probably return at once,\" he concluded \"sad part of my\r\nerrand here to-day is to see if you will relinquish your lease here in\r\ntheir favor.\"\r\n\r\n\"We would better wait and see if they wish to come,\" I said. \"It seems\r\nunlikely, and my town house is being remodeled.\"  At that he let the\r\nmatter drop, but it came up unpleasantly enough, later.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock the body was taken away, and at seven-thirty, after an\r\nearly dinner, Mr. Harton went.  Gertrude had not come down, and there\r\nwas no news of Halsey.  Mr. Jamieson had taken a lodging in the\r\nvillage, and I had not seen him since mid-afternoon.  It was about nine\r\no'clock, I think, when the bell rang and he was ushered into the\r\nliving-room.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down,\" I said grimly.  \"Have you found a clue that will\r\nincriminate me, Mr. Jamieson?\"\r\n\r\nHe had the grace to look uncomfortable.  \"No,\" he said.  \"If you had\r\nkilled Mr. Armstrong, you would have left no clues.  You would have had\r\ntoo much intelligence.\"\r\n\r\nAfter that we got along better.  He was fishing in his pocket, and\r\nafter a minute he brought out two scraps of paper.  \"I have been to the\r\nclub-house,\" he said, \"and among Mr. Armstrong's effects, I found\r\nthese.  One is curious; the other is puzzling.\"\r\n\r\nThe first was a sheet of club note-paper, on which was written, over\r\nand over, the name \"Halsey B. Innes.\"  It was Halsey's flowing\r\nsignature to a dot, but it lacked Halsey's ease.  The ones toward the\r\nbottom of the sheet were much better than the top ones.  Mr. Jamieson\r\nsmiled at my face.\r\n\r\n\"His old tricks,\" he said.  \"That one is merely curious; this one, as I\r\nsaid before, is puzzling.\"\r\n\r\nThe second scrap, folded and refolded into a compass so tiny that the\r\nwriting had been partly obliterated, was part of a letter--the lower\r\nhalf of a sheet, not typed, but written in a cramped hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"----by altering the plans for----rooms, may be possible.  The best\r\nway, in my opinion, would be to----the plan for----in one of\r\nthe----rooms----chimney.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was all.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" I said, looking up.  \"There is nothing in that, is there? A man\r\nought to be able to change the plan of his house without becoming an\r\nobject of suspicion.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is little in the paper itself,\" he admitted; \"but why should\r\nArnold Armstrong carry that around, unless it meant something?  He\r\nnever built a house, you may be sure of that.  If it is this house, it\r\nmay mean anything, from a secret room--\"\r\n\r\n\"To an extra bath-room,\" I said scornfully.  \"Haven't you a\r\nthumb-print, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have,\" he said with a smile, \"and the print of a foot in a tulip\r\nbed, and a number of other things.  The oddest part is, Miss Innes,\r\nthat the thumb-mark is probably yours and the footprint certainly.\"\r\n\r\nHis audacity was the only thing that saved me: his amused smile put me\r\non my mettle, and I ripped out a perfectly good scallop before I\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n\"Why did I step into the tulip bed?\" I asked with interest.\r\n\r\n\"You picked up something,\" he said good-humoredly, \"which you are going\r\nto tell me about later.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I, indeed?\" I was politely curious.  \"With this remarkable insight\r\nof yours, I wish you would tell me where I shall find my\r\nfour-thousand-dollar motor car.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was just coming to that,\" he said.  \"You will find it about thirty\r\nmiles away, at Andrews Station, in a blacksmith shop, where it is being\r\nrepaired.\"\r\n\r\nI laid down my knitting then and looked at him.\r\n\r\n\"And Halsey?\" I managed to say.\r\n\r\n\"We are going to exchange information,\" he said \"I am going to tell you\r\nthat, when you tell me what you picked up in the tulip bed.\"\r\n\r\nWe looked steadily at each other: it was not an unfriendly stare; we\r\nwere only measuring weapons.  Then he smiled a little and got up.\r\n\r\n\"With your permission,\" he said, \"I am going to examine the card-room\r\nand the staircase again.  You might think over my offer in the\r\nmeantime.\"\r\n\r\nHe went on through the drawing-room, and I listened to his footsteps\r\ngrowing gradually fainter.  I dropped my pretense at knitting and,\r\nleaning back, I thought over the last forty-eight hours.  Here was I,\r\nRachel Innes, spinster, a granddaughter of old John Innes of\r\nRevolutionary days, a D. A. R., a Colonial Dame, mixed up with a vulgar\r\nand revolting crime, and even attempting to hoodwink the law!\r\nCertainly I had left the straight and narrow way.\r\n\r\nI was roused by hearing Mr. Jamieson coming rapidly back through the\r\ndrawing-room.  He stopped at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Innes,\" he said quickly, \"will you come with me and light the\r\neast corridor?  I have fastened somebody in the small room at the head\r\nof the card-room stairs.\"\r\n\r\nI jumped! up at once.\r\n\r\n\"You mean--the murderer?\" I gasped.\r\n\r\n\"Possibly,\" he said quietly, as we hurried together up the stairs.\r\n\"Some one was lurking on the staircase when I went back. I spoke;\r\ninstead of an answer, whoever it was turned and ran up. I followed--it\r\nwas dark--but as I turned the corner at the top a figure darted through\r\nthis door and closed it.  The bolt was on my side, and I pushed it\r\nforward.  It is a closet, I think.\"  We were in the upper hall now.\r\n\"If you will show me the electric switch, Miss Innes, you would better\r\nwait in your own room.\"\r\n\r\nTrembling as I was, I was determined to see that door opened.  I hardly\r\nknew what I feared, but so many terrible and inexplicable things had\r\nhappened that suspense was worse than certainty.\r\n\r\n\"I am perfectly cool,\" I said, \"and I am going to remain here.\"\r\n\r\nThe lights flashed up along that end of the corridor, throwing the\r\ndoors into relief.  At the intersection of the small hallway with the\r\nlarger, the circular staircase wound its way up, as if it had been an\r\nafterthought of the architect.  And just around the corner, in the\r\nsmall corridor, was the door Mr. Jamieson had indicated.  I was still\r\nunfamiliar with the house, and I did not remember the door.  My heart\r\nwas thumping wildly in my ears, but I nodded to him to go ahead.  I was\r\nperhaps eight or ten feet away--and then he threw the bolt back.\r\n\r\n\"Come out,\" he said quietly.  There was no response.  \"Come--out,\" he\r\nrepeated.  Then--I think he had a revolver, but I am not sure--he\r\nstepped aside and threw the door open.\r\n\r\nFrom where I stood I could not see beyond the door, but I saw Mr.\r\nJamieson's face change and heard him mutter something, then he bolted\r\ndown the stairs, three at a time.  When my knees had stopped shaking, I\r\nmoved forward, slowly, nervously, until I had a partial view of what\r\nwas beyond the door.  It seemed at first to be a closet, empty.  Then I\r\nwent close and examined it, to stop with a shudder.  Where the floor\r\nshould have been was black void and darkness, from which came the\r\nindescribable, damp smell of the cellars.\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson had locked somebody in the clothes chute.  As I leaned\r\nover I fancied I heard a groan--or was it the wind?\r\n\nI was panic-stricken.  As I ran along the corridor I was confident that\r\nthe mysterious intruder and probable murderer had been found, and that\r\nhe lay dead or dying at the foot of the chute.  I got down the\r\nstaircase somehow, and through the kitchen to the basement stairs.  Mr.\r\nJamieson had been before me, and the door stood open.  Liddy was\r\nstanding in the middle of the kitchen, holding a frying-pan by the\r\nhandle as a weapon.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go down there,\" she yelled, when she saw me moving toward the\r\nbasement stairs.  \"Don't you do it, Miss Rachel.  That Jamieson's down\r\nthere now.  There's only trouble comes of hunting ghosts; they lead you\r\ninto bottomless pits and things like that. Oh, Miss Rachel, don't--\" as\r\nI tried to get past her.\r\n\r\nShe was interrupted by Mr. Jamieson's reappearance.  He ran up the\r\nstairs two at a time, and his face was flushed and furious.\r\n\r\n\"The whole place is locked,\" he said angrily.  \"Where's the laundry key\r\nkept?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's kept in the door,\" Liddy snapped.  \"That whole end of the cellar\r\nis kept locked, so nobody can get at the clothes, and then the key's\r\nleft in the door? so that unless a thief was as blind as--as some\r\ndetectives, he could walk right in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Liddy,\" I said sharply, \"come down with us and turn on all the lights.\"\r\n\r\nShe offered her resignation, as usual, on the spot, but I took her by\r\nthe arm, and she came along finally.  She switched on all the lights\r\nand pointed to a door just ahead.\r\n\r\n\"That's the door,\" she said sulkily.  \"The key's in it.\"\r\n\r\nBut the key was not in it.  Mr. Jamieson shook it, but it was a heavy\r\ndoor, well locked.  And then he stooped and began punching around the\r\nkeyhole with the end of a lead-pencil.  When he stood up his face was\r\nexultant.\r\n\r\n\"It's locked on the inside,\" he said in a low tone.  \"There is somebody\r\nin there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord have mercy!\" gasped Liddy, and turned to run.\r\n\r\n\"Liddy,\" I called, \"go through the house at once and see who is\r\nmissing, or if any one is.  We'll have to clear this thing at once.\r\nMr. Jamieson, if you will watch here I will go to the lodge and find\r\nWarner.  Thomas would be of no use.  Together you may be able to force\r\nthe door.\"\r\n\r\n\"A good idea,\" he assented.  \"But--there are windows, of course, and\r\nthere is nothing to prevent whoever is in there from getting out that\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then lock the door at the top of the basement stairs,\" I suggested,\r\n\"and patrol the house from the outside.\"\r\n\r\nWe agreed to this, and I had a feeling that the mystery of Sunnyside\r\nwas about to be solved.  I ran down the steps and along the drive.\r\nJust at the corner I ran full tilt into somebody who seemed to be as\r\nmuch alarmed as I was.  It was not until I had recoiled a step or two\r\nthat I recognized Gertrude, and she me.\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious, Aunt Ray,\" she exclaimed, \"what is the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's somebody locked in the laundry,\" I panted.  \"That\r\nis--unless--you didn't see any one crossing the lawn or skulking around\r\nthe house, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we have mystery on the brain,\" Gertrude said wearily. \"No, I\r\nhaven't seen any one, except old Thomas, who looked for all the world\r\nas if he had been ransacking the pantry.  What have you locked in the\r\nlaundry?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't wait to explain,\" I replied.  \"I must get Warner from the\r\nlodge.  If you came out for air, you'd better put on your overshoes.\"\r\nAnd then I noticed that Gertrude was limping--not much, but\r\nsufficiently to make her progress very slow, and seemingly painful.\r\n\r\n\"You have hurt yourself,\" I said sharply.\r\n\r\n\"I fell over the carriage block,\" she explained.  \"I thought perhaps I\r\nmight see Halsey coming home.  He--he ought to be here.\"\r\n\r\nI hurried on down the drive.  The lodge was some distance from the\r\nhouse, in a grove of trees where the drive met the county road.  There\r\nwere two white stone pillars to mark the entrance, but the iron gates,\r\nonce closed and tended by the lodge-keeper, now stood permanently open.\r\nThe day of the motor-car had come; no one had time for closed gates and\r\nlodge-keepers.  The lodge at Sunnyside was merely a sort of\r\nsupplementary servants' quarters: it was as convenient in its\r\nappointments as the big house and infinitely more cozy.\r\n\r\nAs I went down the drive, my thoughts were busy.  Who would it be that\r\nMr. Jamieson had trapped in the cellar?  Would we find a body or some\r\none badly injured?  Scarcely either.  Whoever had fallen had been able\r\nto lock the laundry door on the inside.  If the fugitive had come from\r\noutside the house, how did he get in? If it was some member of the\r\nhousehold, who could it have been? And then--a feeling of horror almost\r\noverwhelmed me.  Gertrude! Gertrude and her injured ankle!  Gertrude\r\nfound limping slowly up the drive when I had thought she was in bed!\r\n\r\nI tried to put the thought away, but it would not go.  If Gertrude had\r\nbeen on the circular staircase that night, why had she fled from Mr.\r\nJamieson?  The idea, puzzling as it was, seemed borne out by this\r\ncircumstance.  Whoever had taken refuge at the head of the stairs could\r\nscarcely have been familiar with the house, or with the location of the\r\nchute.  The mystery seemed to deepen constantly.  What possible\r\nconnection could there be between Halsey and Gertrude, and the murder\r\nof Arnold Armstrong? And yet, every way I turned I seemed to find\r\nsomething that pointed to such a connection.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the drive the road described a long, sloping,\r\nhorseshoe-shaped curve around the lodge.  There were lights there,\r\nstreaming cheerfully out on to the trees, and from an upper room came\r\nwavering shadows, as if some one with a lamp was moving around.  I had\r\ncome almost silently in my evening slippers, and I had my second\r\ncollision of the evening on the road just above the house.  I ran full\r\ninto a man in a long coat, who was standing in the shadow beside the\r\ndrive, with his back to me, watching the lighted windows.\r\n\r\n\"What the hell!\" he ejaculated furiously, and turned around. When he\r\nsaw me, however, he did not wait for any retort on my part.  He faded\r\naway--this is not slang; he did--he absolutely disappeared in the dusk\r\nwithout my getting more than a glimpse of his face.  I had a vague\r\nimpression of unfamiliar features and of a sort of cap with a visor.\r\nThen he was gone.\r\n\r\nI went to the lodge and rapped.  It required two or three poundings to\r\nbring Thomas to the door, and he opened it only an inch or so.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Warner?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I--I think he's in bed, ma'm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get him up,\" I said, \"and for goodness' sake open the door, Thomas.\r\nI'll wait for Warner.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's kind o' close in here, ma'm,\" he said, obeying gingerly, and\r\ndisclosing a cool and comfortable looking interior.  \"Perhaps you'd\r\nkeer to set on the porch an' rest yo'self.\"\r\n\r\nIt was so evident that Thomas did not want me inside that I went in.\r\n\r\n\"Tell Warner he is needed in a hurry,\" I repeated, and turned into the\r\nlittle sitting-room.  I could hear Thomas going up the stairs, could\r\nhear him rouse Warner, and the steps of the chauffeur as he hurriedly\r\ndressed.  But my attention was busy with the room below.\r\n\r\nOn the center-table, open, was a sealskin traveling bag.  It was filled\r\nwith gold-topped bottles and brushes, and it breathed opulence, luxury,\r\nfemininity from every inch of surface.  How did it get there?  I was\r\nstill asking myself the question when Warner came running down the\r\nstairs and into the room.  He was completely but somewhat incongruously\r\ndressed, and his open, boyish face looked abashed.  He was a country\r\nboy, absolutely frank and reliable, of fair education and\r\nintelligence--one of the small army of American youths who turn a\r\nnatural aptitude for mechanics into the special field of the\r\nautomobile, and earn good salaries in a congenial occupation.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Miss Innes?\" he asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"There is some one locked in the laundry,\" I replied.  \"Mr. Jamieson\r\nwants you to help him break the lock.  Warner, whose bag is this?\"\r\n\r\nHe was in the doorway by this time, and he pretended not to hear.\r\n\r\n\"Warner,\" I called, \"come back here.  Whose bag is this?\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped then, but he did not turn around.\r\n\r\n\"It's--it belongs to Thomas,\" he said, and fled up the drive.\r\n\r\nTo Thomas!  A London bag with mirrors and cosmetic jars of which Thomas\r\ncould not even have guessed the use!  However, I put the bag in the\r\nback of my mind, which was fast becoming stored with anomalous and\r\napparently irreconcilable facts, and followed Warner to the house.\r\n\r\nLiddy had come back to the kitchen: the door to the basement stairs was\r\ndouble-barred, and had a table pushed against it; and beside her on the\r\ntable was most of the kitchen paraphernalia.\r\n\r\n\"Did you see if there was any one missing in the house?\" I asked,\r\nignoring the array of sauce-pans rolling-pins, and the poker of the\r\nrange.\r\n\r\n\"Rosie is missing,\" Liddy said with unction.  She had objected to\r\nRosie, the parlor maid, from the start.  \"Mrs. Watson went into her\r\nroom, and found she had gone without her hat.  People that trust\r\nthemselves a dozen miles from the city, in strange houses, with\r\nservants they don't know, needn't be surprised if they wake up some\r\nmorning and find their throats cut.\"\r\n\r\nAfter which carefully veiled sarcasm Liddy relapsed into gloom. Warner\r\ncame in then with a handful of small tools, and Mr. Jamieson went with\r\nhim to the basement.  Oddly enough, I was not alarmed.  With all my\r\nheart I wished for Halsey, but I was not frightened.  At the door he\r\nwas to force, Warner put down his tools and looked at it.  Then he\r\nturned the handle.  Without the slightest difficulty the door opened,\r\nrevealing the blackness of the drying-room beyond!\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson gave an exclamation of disgust.\r\n\r\n\"Gone!\" he said.  \"Confound such careless work!  I might have known.\"\r\n\r\nIt was true enough.  We got the lights on finally and looked all\r\nthrough the three rooms that constituted this wing of the basement.\r\nEverything was quiet and empty.  An explanation of how the fugitive had\r\nescaped injury was found in a heaped-up basket of clothes under the\r\nchute.  The basket had been overturned, but that was all.  Mr. Jamieson\r\nexamined the windows: one was unlocked, and offered an easy escape.\r\nThe window or the door? Which way had the fugitive escaped?  The door\r\nseemed most probable, and I hoped it had been so.  I could not have\r\nborne, just then, to think that it was my poor Gertrude we had been\r\nhounding through the darkness, and yet--I had met Gertrude not far from\r\nthat very window.\r\n\r\nI went up-stairs at last, tired and depressed.  Mrs. Watson and Liddy\r\nwere making tea in the kitchen.  In certain walks of life the tea-pot\r\nis the refuge in times of stress, trouble or sickness: they give tea to\r\nthe dying and they put it in the baby's nursing bottle.  Mrs. Watson\r\nwas fixing a tray to be sent in to me, and when I asked her about Rosie\r\nshe confirmed her absence.\r\n\r\n\"She's not here,\" she said; \"but I would not think much of that, Miss\r\nInnes.  Rosie is a pretty young girl, and perhaps she has a sweetheart.\r\nIt will be a good thing if she has.  The maids stay much better when\r\nthey have something like that to hold them here.\"\r\n\r\nGertrude had gone back to her room, and while I was drinking my cup of\r\nhot tea, Mr. Jamieson came in.\r\n\r\n\"We might take up the conversation where we left off an hour and a half\r\nago,\" he said.  \"But before we go on, I want to say this: The person\r\nwho escaped from the laundry was a woman with a foot of moderate size\r\nand well arched.  She wore nothing but a stocking on her right foot,\r\nand, in spite of the unlocked door, she escaped by the window.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again I thought of Gertrude's sprained ankle.  Was it the right or\r\nthe left?\r\n\n\"Miss Innes,\" the detective began, \"what is your opinion of the figure\r\nyou saw on the east veranda the night you and your maid were in the\r\nhouse alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a woman,\" I said positively.\r\n\r\n\"And yet your maid affirms with equal positiveness that it was a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" I broke in.  \"Liddy had her eyes shut--she always shuts\r\nthem when she's frightened.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you never thought then that the intruder who came later that night\r\nmight be a woman--the woman, in fact, whom you saw on the veranda?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had reasons for thinking it was a man,\" I said remembering the pearl\r\ncuff-link.\r\n\r\n\"Now we are getting down to business.  WHAT were your reasons for\r\nthinking that?\"\r\n\r\nI hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"If you have any reason for believing that your midnight guest was Mr.\r\nArmstrong, other than his visit here the next night, you ought to tell\r\nme, Miss Innes.  We can take nothing for granted. If, for instance, the\r\nintruder who dropped the bar and scratched the staircase--you see, I\r\nknow about that--if this visitor was a woman, why should not the same\r\nwoman have come back the following night, met Mr. Armstrong on the\r\ncircular staircase, and in alarm shot him?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a man,\" I reiterated.  And then, because I could think of no\r\nother reason for my statement, I told him about the pearl cuff-link.\r\nHe was intensely interested.\r\n\r\n\"Will you give me the link,\" he said, when I finished, \"or, at least,\r\nlet me see it?  I consider it a most important clue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't the description do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not as well as the original.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm very sorry,\" I said, as calmly as I could, \"I--the thing is\r\nlost.  It--it must have fallen out of a box on my dressing-table.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever he thought of my explanation, and I knew he doubted it, he\r\nmade no sign.  He asked me to describe the link accurately, and I did\r\nso, while he glanced at a list he took from his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"One set monogram cuff-links,\" he read, \"one set plain pearl links, one\r\nset cuff-links, woman's head set with diamonds and emeralds.  There is\r\nno mention of such a link as you describe, and yet, if your theory is\r\nright, Mr. Armstrong must have taken back in his cuffs one complete\r\ncuff-link, and a half, perhaps, of the other.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea was new to me.  If it had not been the murdered man who had\r\nentered the house that night, who had it been?\r\n\r\n\"There are a number of strange things connected with this case,\" the\r\ndetective went on.  \"Miss Gertrude Innes testified that she heard some\r\none fumbling with the lock, that the door opened, and that almost\r\nimmediately the shot was fired.  Now, Miss Innes, here is the strange\r\npart of that.  Mr. Armstrong had no key with him.  There was no key in\r\nthe lock, or on the floor.  In other words, the evidence points\r\nabsolutely to this:  Mr. Armstrong was admitted to the house from\r\nwithin.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible,\" I broke in.  \"Mr. Jamieson, do you know what your\r\nwords imply?  Do you know that you are practically accusing Gertrude\r\nInnes of admitting that man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite that,\" he said, with his friendly smile.  \"In fact, Miss\r\nInnes, I am quite certain she did not.  But as long as I learn only\r\nparts of the truth, from both you and her, what can I do?  I know you\r\npicked up something in the flower bed: you refuse to tell me what it\r\nwas.  I know Miss Gertrude went back to the billiard-room to get\r\nsomething, she refuses to say what.  You suspect what happened to the\r\ncuff-link, but you won't tell me. So far, all I am sure of is this:  I\r\ndo not believe Arnold Armstrong was the midnight visitor who so alarmed\r\nyou by dropping--shall we say, a golf-stick?  And I believe that when\r\nhe did come he was admitted by some one in the house.  Who knows--it\r\nmay have been--Liddy!\"\r\n\r\nI stirred my tea angrily.\r\n\r\n\"I have always heard,\" I said dryly, \"that undertakers' assistants are\r\njovial young men.  A man's sense of humor seems to be in inverse\r\nproportion to the gravity of his profession.\"\r\n\r\n\"A man's sense of humor is a barbarous and a cruel thing, Miss Innes,\"\r\nhe admitted.  \"It is to the feminine as the hug of a bear is to the\r\nscratch of--well;--anything with claws.  Is that you, Thomas?  Come in.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Johnson stood in the doorway.  He looked alarmed and\r\napprehensive, and suddenly I remembered the sealskin dressing-bag in\r\nthe lodge.  Thomas came just inside the door and stood with his head\r\ndrooping, his eyes, under their shaggy gray brows, fixed on Mr.\r\nJamieson.\r\n\r\n\"Thomas,\" said the detective, not unkindly, \"I sent for you to tell us\r\nwhat you told Sam Bohannon at the club, the day before Mr. Arnold was\r\nfound here, dead.  Let me see.  You came here Friday night to see Miss\r\nInnes, didn't you?  And came to work here Saturday morning?\"\r\n\r\nFor some unexplained reason Thomas looked relieved.\r\n\r\n\"Yas, sah,\" he said.  \"You see it were like this:  When Mistah\r\nArmstrong and the fam'ly went away, Mis' Watson an' me, we was lef' in\r\ncharge till the place was rented.  Mis' Watson, she've bin here a good\r\nwhile, an' she warn' skeery.  So she slep' in the house.  I'd bin\r\nhavin' tokens--I tol' Mis' Innes some of 'em--an' I slep' in the lodge.\r\nThen one day Mis' Watson, she came to me an' she sez, sez she, 'Thomas,\r\nyou'll hev to sleep up in the big house.  I'm too nervous to do it any\r\nmore.'  But I jes' reckon to myself that ef it's too skeery fer her,\r\nit's too skeery fer me.  We had it, then, sho' nuff, and it ended up\r\nwith Mis' Watson stayin' in the lodge nights an' me lookin' fer work at\r\nde club.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did Mrs. Watson say that anything had happened to alarm her?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sah.  She was jes' natchally skeered.  Well, that was all, far's I\r\nknow, until the night I come over to see Mis' Innes.  I come across the\r\nvalley, along the path from the club-house, and I goes home that way.\r\nDown in the creek bottom I almost run into a man.  He wuz standin' with\r\nhis back to me, an' he was workin' with one of these yere electric\r\nlight things that fit in yer pocket.  He was havin' trouble--one minute\r\nit'd flash out, an' the nex' it'd be gone.  I hed a view of 'is white\r\ndress shirt an' tie, as I passed.  I didn't see his face.  But I know\r\nit warn't Mr. Arnold.  It was a taller man than Mr. Arnold.  Beside\r\nthat, Mr. Arnold was playin' cards when I got to the club-house, same's\r\nhe'd been doin' all day.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the next morning you came back along the path,\" pursued Mr.\r\nJamieson relentlessly.\r\n\r\n\"The nex' mornin' I come back along the path an' down where I dun see\r\nthe man night befoh, I picked up this here.\"  The old man held out a\r\ntiny object and Mr. Jamieson took it.  Then he held it on his extended\r\npalm for me to see.  It was the other half of the pearl cuff-link!\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Jamieson was not quite through questioning him.\r\n\r\n\"And so you showed it to Sam, at the club, and asked him if he knew any\r\none who owned such a link, and Sam said--what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wal, Sam, he 'lowed he'd seen such a pair of cuff-buttons in a shirt\r\nbelongin' to Mr. Bailey--Mr. Jack Bailey, sah.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll keep this link, Thomas, for a while,\" the detective said. \"That's\r\nall I wanted to know.  Good night.\"\r\n\r\nAs Thomas shuffled out, Mr. Jamieson watched me sharply.\r\n\r\n\"You see, Miss Innes,\" he said, \"Mr. Bailey insists on mixing himself\r\nwith this thing.  If Mr. Bailey came here that Friday night expecting\r\nto meet Arnold Armstrong, and missed him--if, as I say, he had done\r\nthis, might he not, seeing him enter the following night, have struck\r\nhim down, as he had intended before?\"\r\n\r\n\"But the motive?\" I gasped.\r\n\r\n\"There could be motive proved, I think.  Arnold Armstrong and John\r\nBailey have been enemies since the latter, as cashier of the Traders'\r\nBank, brought Arnold almost into the clutches of the law.  Also, you\r\nforget that both men have been paying attention to Miss Gertrude.\r\nBailey's flight looks bad, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you think Halsey helped him to escape?\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly.  Why, what could it be but flight?  Miss Innes, let me\r\nreconstruct that evening, as I see it.  Bailey and Armstrong had\r\nquarreled at the club.  I learned this to-day.  Your nephew brought\r\nBailey over.  Prompted by jealous, insane fury, Armstrong followed,\r\ncoming across by the path.  He entered the billiard-room wing--perhaps\r\nrapping, and being admitted by your nephew. Just inside he was shot, by\r\nsome one on the circular staircase. The shot fired, your nephew and\r\nBailey left the house at once, going toward the automobile house.  They\r\nleft by the lower road, which prevented them being heard, and when you\r\nand Miss Gertrude got down-stairs everything was quiet.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--Gertrude's story,\" I stammered.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Gertrude only brought forward her explanation the following\r\nmorning.  I do not believe it, Miss Innes.  It is the story of a loving\r\nand ingenious woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"And--this thing to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"May upset my whole view of the case.  We must give the benefit of\r\nevery doubt, after all.  We may, for instance, come back to the figure\r\non the porch: if it was a woman you saw that night through the window,\r\nwe might start with other premises.  Or Mr. Innes' explanation may turn\r\nus in a new direction.  It is possible that he shot Arnold Armstrong as\r\na burglar and then fled, frightened at what he had done.  In any case,\r\nhowever, I feel confident that the body was here when he left.  Mr.\r\nArmstrong left the club ostensibly for a moonlight saunter, about half\r\nafter eleven o'clock.  It was three when the shot was fired.\"\r\n\r\nI leaned back bewildered.  It seemed to me that the evening had been\r\nfull of significant happenings, had I only held the key. Had Gertrude\r\nbeen the fugitive in the clothes chute?  Who was the man on the drive\r\nnear the lodge, and whose gold-mounted dressing-bag had I seen in the\r\nlodge sitting-room?\r\n\r\nIt was late when Mr. Jamieson finally got up to go.  I went with him to\r\nthe door, and together we stood looking out over the valley.  Below lay\r\nthe village of Casanova, with its Old World houses, its blossoming\r\ntrees and its peace.  Above on the hill across the valley were the\r\nlights of the Greenwood Club.  It was even possible to see the curving\r\nrow of parallel lights that marked the carriage road.  Rumors that I\r\nhad heard about the club came back--of drinking, of high play, and\r\nonce, a year ago, of a suicide under those very lights.\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson left, taking a short cut to the village, and I still stood\r\nthere.  It must have been after eleven, and the monotonous tick of the\r\nbig clock on the stairs behind me was the only sound.\r\n\r\nThen I was conscious that some one was running up the drive.  In a\r\nminute a woman darted into the area of light made by the open door, and\r\ncaught me by the arm.  It was Rosie--Rosie in a state of collapse from\r\nterror, and, not the least important, clutching one of my Coalport\r\nplates and a silver spoon.\r\n\r\nShe stood staring into the darkness behind, still holding the plate.  I\r\ngot her into the house and secured the plate; then I stood and looked\r\ndown at her where she crouched tremblingly against the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I asked, \"didn't your young man enjoy his meal?\"\r\n\r\nShe couldn't speak.  She looked at the spoon she still held--I wasn't\r\nso anxious about it: thank Heaven, it wouldn't chip--and then she\r\nstared at me.\r\n\r\n\"I appreciate your desire to have everything nice for him,\" I went on,\r\n\"but the next time, you might take the Limoges china It's more easily\r\nduplicated and less expensive.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't a young man--not here.\"  She had got her breath now, as I\r\nhad guessed she would.  \"I--I have been chased by a thief, Miss Innes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he chase you out of the house and back again?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nThen Rosie began to cry--not silently, but noisily, hysterically.\r\n\r\nI stopped her by giving her a good shake.\r\n\r\n\"What in the world is the matter with you?\" I snapped.  \"Has the day of\r\ngood common sense gone by!  Sit up and tell me the whole thing.\"  Rosie\r\nsat up then, and sniffled.\r\n\r\n\"I was coming up the drive--\" she began.\r\n\r\n\"You must start with when you went DOWN the drive, with my dishes and\r\nmy silver,\" I interrupted, but, seeing more signs of hysteria, I gave\r\nin.  \"Very well.  You were coming up the drive--\"\r\n\r\n\"I had a basket of--of silver and dishes on my arm and I was carrying\r\nthe plate, because--because I was afraid I'd break it. Part-way up the\r\nroad a man stepped out of the bushes, and held his arm like this,\r\nspread out, so I couldn't get past.  He said--he said--'Not so fast,\r\nyoung lady; I want you to let me see what's in that basket.'\"\r\n\r\nShe got up in her excitement and took hold of my arm.\r\n\r\n\"It was like this, Miss Innes,\" she said, \"and say you was the man.\r\nWhen he said that, I screamed and ducked under his arm like this.  He\r\ncaught at the basket and I dropped it.  I ran as fast as I could, and\r\nhe came after as far as the trees.  Then he stopped.  Oh, Miss Innes,\r\nit must have been the man that killed that Mr. Armstrong!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be foolish,\" I said.  \"Whoever killed Mr. Armstrong would put as\r\nmuch space between himself and this house as he could.  Go up to bed\r\nnow; and mind, if I hear of this story being repeated to the other\r\nmaids, I shall deduct from your wages for every broken dish I find in\r\nthe drive.\"\r\n\r\nI listened to Rosie as she went up-stairs, running past the shadowy\r\nplaces and slamming her door.  Then I sat down and looked at the\r\nCoalport plate and the silver spoon.  I had brought my own china and\r\nsilver, and, from all appearances, I would have little enough to take\r\nback.  But though I might jeer at Rosie as much as I wished, the fact\r\nremained that some one had been on the drive that night who had no\r\nbusiness there.  Although neither had Rosie, for that matter.\r\n\r\nI could fancy Liddy's face when she missed the extra pieces of\r\nchina--she had opposed Rosie from the start.  If Liddy once finds a\r\nprophecy fulfilled, especially an unpleasant one, she never allows me\r\nto forget it.  It seemed to me that it was absurd to leave that china\r\ndotted along the road for her to spy the next morning; so with a sudden\r\nresolution, I opened the door again and stepped out into the darkness.\r\nAs the door closed behind me I half regretted my impulse; then I shut\r\nmy teeth and went on.\r\n\r\nI have never been a nervous woman, as I said before.  Moreover, a\r\nminute or two in the darkness enabled me to see things fairly well.\r\nBeulah gave me rather a start by rubbing unexpectedly against my feet;\r\nthen we two, side by side, went down the drive.\r\n\r\nThere were no fragments of china, but where the grove began I picked up\r\na silver spoon.  So far Rosie's story was borne out:  I began to wonder\r\nif it were not indiscreet, to say the least, this midnight prowling in\r\na neighborhood with such a deservedly bad reputation.  Then I saw\r\nsomething gleaming, which proved to be the handle of a cup, and a step\r\nor two farther on I found a V-shaped bit of a plate.  But the most\r\nsurprising thing of all was to find the basket sitting comfortably\r\nbeside the road, with the rest of the broken crockery piled neatly\r\nwithin, and a handful of small silver, spoon, forks, and the like, on\r\ntop!  I could only stand and stare.  Then Rosie's story was true.  But\r\nwhere had Rosie carried her basket?  And why had the thief, if he were\r\na thief, picked up the broken china out of the road and left it, with\r\nhis booty?\r\n\r\nIt was with my nearest approach to a nervous collapse that I heard the\r\nfamiliar throbbing of an automobile engine.  As it came closer I\r\nrecognized the outline of the Dragon Fly, and knew that Halsey had come\r\nback.\r\n\r\nStrange enough it must have seemed to Halsey, too, to come across me in\r\nthe middle of the night, with the skirt of my gray silk gown over my\r\nshoulders to keep off the dew, holding a red and green basket under one\r\narm and a black cat under the other.  What with relief and joy, I began\r\nto cry, right there, and very nearly wiped my eyes on Beulah in the\r\nexcitement.\r\n\n\"Aunt Ray!\" Halsey said from the gloom behind the lamps.  \"What in the\r\nworld are you doing here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Taking a walk,\" I said, trying to be composed.  I don't think the\r\nanswer struck either of us as being ridiculous at the time. \"Oh,\r\nHalsey, where have you been?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me take you up to the house.\"  He was in the road, and had Beulah\r\nand the basket out of my arms in a moment.  I could see the car plainly\r\nnow, and Warner was at the wheel--Warner in an ulster and a pair of\r\nslippers, over Heaven knows what.  Jack Bailey was not there.  I got\r\nin, and we went slowly and painfully up to the house.\r\n\r\nWe did not talk.  What we had to say was too important to commence\r\nthere, and, besides, it took all kinds of coaxing from both men to get\r\nthe Dragon Fly up the last grade.  Only when we had closed the front\r\ndoor and stood facing each other in the hall, did Halsey say anything.\r\nHe slipped his strong young arm around my shoulders and turned me so I\r\nfaced the light.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Aunt Ray!\" he said gently.  And I nearly wept again.  \"I--I must\r\nsee Gertrude, too; we will have a three-cornered talk.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then Gertrude herself came down the stairs.  She had not been to\r\nbed, evidently: she still wore the white negligee she had worn earlier\r\nin the evening, and she limped somewhat.  During her slow progress down\r\nthe stairs I had time to notice one thing:  Mr. Jamieson had said the\r\nwoman who escaped from the cellar had worn no shoe on her right foot.\r\nGertrude's right ankle was the one she had sprained!\r\n\r\nThe meeting between brother and sister was tense, but without tears.\r\nHalsey kissed her tenderly, and I noticed evidences of strain and\r\nanxiety in both young faces.\r\n\r\n\"Is everything--right?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Right as can be,\" with forced cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nI lighted the living-room and we went in there.  Only a half-hour\r\nbefore I had sat with Mr. Jamieson in that very room, listening while\r\nhe overtly accused both Gertrude and Halsey of at least a knowledge of\r\nthe death of Arnold Armstrong.  Now Halsey was here to speak for\r\nhimself:  I should learn everything that had puzzled me.\r\n\r\n\"I saw it in the paper to-night for the first time,\" he was saying.\r\n\"It knocked me dumb.  When I think of this houseful of women, and a\r\nthing like that occurring!\"\r\n\r\nGertrude's face was still set and white.  \"That isn't all, Halsey,\" she\r\nsaid.  \"You and--and Jack left almost at the time it happened.  The\r\ndetective here thinks that you--that we--know something about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil he does!\" Halsey's eyes were fairly starting from his head.\r\n\"I beg your pardon, Aunt Ray, but--the fellow's a lunatic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me everything, won't you, Halsey?\" I begged.  \"Tell me where you\r\nwent that night, or rather morning, and why you went as you did.  This\r\nhas been a terrible forty-eight hours for all of us.\"\r\n\r\nHe stood staring at me, and I could see the horror of the situation\r\ndawning in his face.\r\n\r\n\"I can't tell you where I went, Aunt Ray,\" he said, after a moment.\r\n\"As to why, you will learn that soon enough.  But Gertrude knows that\r\nJack and I left the house before this thing--this horrible\r\nmurder--occurred.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Jamieson does not believe me,\" Gertrude said drearily. \"Halsey, if\r\nthe worst comes, if they should arrest you, you must--tell.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall tell nothing,\" he said with a new sternness in his voice.\r\n\"Aunt Ray, it was necessary for Jack and me to leave that night.  I can\r\nnot tell you why--just yet.  As to where we went, if I have to depend\r\non that as an alibi, I shall not tell.  The whole thing is an\r\nabsurdity, a trumped-up charge that can not possibly be serious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has Mr. Bailey gone back to the city,\" I demanded, \"or to the club?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither,\" defiantly; \"at the present moment I do not know where he is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Halsey,\" I asked gravely, leaning forward, \"have you the slightest\r\nsuspicion who killed Arnold Armstrong?  The police think he was\r\nadmitted from within, and that he was shot down from above, by someone\r\non the circular staircase.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing of it,\" he maintained; but I fancied I caught a sudden\r\nglance at Gertrude, a flash of something that died as it came.\r\n\r\nAs quietly, as calmly as I could, I went over the whole story, from the\r\nnight Liddy and I had been alone up to the strange experience of Rosie\r\nand her pursuer.  The basket still stood on the table, a mute witness\r\nto this last mystifying occurrence.\r\n\r\n\"There is something else,\" I said hesitatingly, at the last. \"Halsey, I\r\nhave never told this even to Gertrude, but the morning after the crime,\r\nI found, in a tulip bed, a revolver.  It--it was yours, Halsey.\"\r\n\r\nFor an appreciable moment Halsey stared at me.  Then he turned to\r\nGertrude.\r\n\r\n\"My revolver, Trude!\" he exclaimed.  \"Why, Jack took my revolver with\r\nhim, didn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, for Heaven's sake don't say that,\" I implored.  \"The detective\r\nthinks possibly Jack Bailey came back, and--and the thing happened\r\nthen.\"\r\n\r\n\"He didn't come back,\" Halsey said sternly.  \"Gertrude, when you\r\nbrought down a revolver that night for Jack to take with him, what one\r\ndid you bring?  Mine?\"\r\n\r\nGertrude was defiant now.\r\n\r\n\"No.  Yours was loaded, and I was afraid of what Jack might do.  I gave\r\nhim one I have had for a year or two.  It was empty.\"\r\n\r\nHalsey threw up both hands despairingly.\r\n\r\n\"If that isn't like a girl!\" he said.  \"Why didn't you do what I asked\r\nyou to, Gertrude?  You send Bailey off with an empty gun, and throw\r\nmine in a tulip bed, of all places on earth!  Mine was a thirty-eight\r\ncaliber.  The inquest will show, of course, that the bullet that killed\r\nArmstrong was a thirty-eight.  Then where shall I be?\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget,\" I broke in, \"that I have the revolver, and that no one\r\nknows about it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Gertrude had risen angrily.\r\n\r\n\"I can not stand it; it is always with me,\" she cried.  \"Halsey, I did\r\nnot throw your revolver into the tulip bed. I--think--you--did\r\nit--yourself!\"\r\n\r\nThey stared at each other across the big library table, with young eyes\r\nall at once hard, suspicious.  And then Gertrude held out both hands to\r\nhim appealingly.\r\n\r\n\"We must not,\" she said brokenly.  \"Just now, with so much at stake,\r\nit--is shameful.  I know you are as ignorant as I am. Make me believe\r\nit, Halsey.\"\r\n\r\nHalsey soothed her as best he could, and the breach seemed healed.  But\r\nlong after I went to bed he sat down-stairs in the living-room alone,\r\nand I knew he was going over the case as he had learned it.  Some\r\nthings were clear to him that were dark to me.  He knew, and Gertrude,\r\ntoo, why Jack Bailey and he had gone away that night, as they did.  He\r\nknew where they had been for the last forty-eight hours, and why Jack\r\nBailey had not returned with him.  It seemed to me that without fuller\r\nconfidence from both the children--they are always children to me--I\r\nshould never be able to learn anything.\r\n\r\nAs I was finally getting ready for bed, Halsey came up-stairs and\r\nknocked at my door.  When I had got into a negligee--I used to say\r\nwrapper before Gertrude came back from school--I let him in. He stood\r\nin the doorway a moment, and then he went into agonies of silent mirth.\r\nI sat down on the side of the bed and waited in severe silence for him\r\nto stop, but he only seemed to grow worse.\r\n\r\nWhen he had recovered he took me by the elbow and pulled me in front of\r\nthe mirror.\r\n\r\n\"'How to be beautiful,'\" he quoted.  \"'Advice to maids and matrons,' by\r\nBeatrice Fairfax!\"  And then I saw myself.  I had neglected to remove\r\nmy wrinkle eradicators, and I presume my appearance was odd.  I believe\r\nthat it is a woman's duty to care for her looks, but it is much like\r\ntelling a necessary falsehood--one must not be found out.  By the time\r\nI got them off Halsey was serious again, and I listened to his story.\r\n\r\n\"Aunt Ray,\" he began, extinguishing his cigarette on the back of my\r\nivory hair-brush, \"I would give a lot to tell you the whole thing.\r\nBut--I can't, for a day or so, anyhow.  But one thing I might have told\r\nyou a long time ago.  If you had known it, you would not have suspected\r\nme for a moment of--of having anything to do with the attack on Arnold\r\nArmstrong.  Goodness knows what I might do to a fellow like that, if\r\nthere was enough provocation, and I had a gun in my hand--under\r\nordinary circumstances.  But--I care a great deal about Louise\r\nArmstrong, Aunt Ray.  I hope to marry her some day.  Is it likely I\r\nwould kill her brother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her stepbrother,\" I corrected.  \"No, of course, it isn't likely, or\r\npossible.  Why didn't you tell me, Halsey?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there were two reasons,\" he said slowly.\r\n\r\n\"One was that you had a girl already picked out for me--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" I broke in, and felt myself growing red.  I had, indeed,\r\none of the--but no matter.\r\n\r\n\"And the second reason,\" he pursued, \"was that the Armstrongs would\r\nhave none of me.\"\r\n\r\nI sat bolt upright at that and gasped.\r\n\r\n\"The Armstrongs!\" I repeated.  \"With old Peter Armstrong driving a\r\nstage across the mountains while your grandfather was war governor--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, of course, the war governor's dead, and out of the matrimonial\r\nmarket,\" Halsey interrupted.  \"And the present Innes admits himself he\r\nisn't good enough for--for Louise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" I said despairingly, \"and, of course, you are taken at your\r\nown valuation.  The Inneses are not always so self-depreciatory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not always, no,\" he said, looking at me with his boyish smile.\r\n\"Fortunately, Louise doesn't agree with her family.  She's willing to\r\ntake me, war governor or no, provided her mother consents.  She isn't\r\noverly-fond of her stepfather, but she adores her mother.  And now,\r\ncan't you see where this thing puts me?  Down and out, with all of\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the whole thing is absurd,\" I argued.  \"And besides, Gertrude's\r\nsworn statement that you left before Arnold Armstrong came would clear\r\nyou at once.\"\r\n\r\nHalsey got up and began to pace the room, and the air of cheerfulness\r\ndropped like a mask.\r\n\r\n\"She can't swear it,\" he said finally.  \"Gertrude's story was true as\r\nfar as it went, but she didn't tell everything.  Arnold Armstrong came\r\nhere at two-thirty--came into the billiard-room and left in five\r\nminutes.  He came to bring--something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Halsey,\" I cried, \"you MUST tell me the whole truth.  Every time I see\r\na way for you to escape you block it yourself with this wall of\r\nmystery.  What did he bring?\"\r\n\r\n\"A telegram--for Bailey,\" he said.  \"It came by special messenger from\r\ntown, and was--most important.  Bailey had started for here, and the\r\nmessenger had gone back to the city.  The steward gave it to Arnold,\r\nwho had been drinking all day and couldn't sleep, and was going for a\r\nstroll in the direction of Sunnyside.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he brought it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was in the telegram?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can tell you--as soon as certain things are made public.  It is only\r\na matter of days now,\" gloomily.\r\n\r\n\"And Gertrude's story of a telephone message?\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor Trude!\" he half whispered.  \"Poor loyal little girl! Aunt Ray,\r\nthere was no such message.  No doubt your detective already knows that\r\nand discredits all Gertrude told him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when she went back, it was to get--the telegram?\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably,\" Halsey said slowly.  \"When you get to thinking about it,\r\nAunt Ray, it looks bad for all three of us, doesn't it?  And yet--I\r\nwill take my oath none of us even inadvertently killed that poor devil.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at the closed door into Gertrude's dressing-room, and lowered\r\nmy voice.\r\n\r\n\"The same horrible thought keeps recurring to me,\" I whispered.\r\n\"Halsey, Gertrude probably had your revolver: she must have examined\r\nit, anyhow, that night.  After you--and Jack had gone, what if that\r\nruffian came back, and she--and she--\"\r\n\r\nI couldn't finish.  Halsey stood looking at me with shut lips.\r\n\r\n\"She might have heard him fumbling at the door he had no key, the\r\npolice say--and thinking it was you, or Jack, she admitted him.  When\r\nshe saw her mistake she ran up the stairs, a step or two, and turning,\r\nlike an animal at bay, she fired.\"\r\n\r\nHalsey had his hand over my lips before I finished, and in that\r\nposition we stared each at the other, our stricken glances crossing.\r\n\r\n\"The revolver--my revolver--thrown into the tulip bed!\" he muttered to\r\nhimself.  \"Thrown perhaps from an upper window: you say it was buried\r\ndeep.  Her prostration ever since, her--Aunt Ray, you don't think it\r\nwas Gertrude who fell down the clothes chute?\"\r\n\r\nI could only nod my head in a hopeless affirmative.\r\n\nThe morning after Halsey's return was Tuesday.  Arnold Armstrong had\r\nbeen found dead at the foot of the circular staircase at three o'clock\r\non Sunday morning.  The funeral services were to be held on Tuesday,\r\nand the interment of the body was to be deferred until the Armstrongs\r\narrived from California.  No one, I think, was very sorry that Arnold\r\nArmstrong was dead, but the manner of his death aroused some sympathy\r\nand an enormous amount of curiosity.  Mrs. Ogden Fitzhugh, a cousin,\r\ntook charge of the arrangements, and everything, I believe, was as\r\nquiet as possible.  I gave Thomas Johnson and Mrs. Watson permission to\r\ngo into town to pay their last respects to the dead man, but for some\r\nreason they did not care to go.\r\n\r\nHalsey spent part of the day with Mr. Jamieson, but he said nothing of\r\nwhat happened.  He looked grave and anxious, and he had a long\r\nconversation with Gertrude late in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nTuesday evening found us quiet, with the quiet that precedes an\r\nexplosion.  Gertrude and Halsey were both gloomy and distraught, and as\r\nLiddy had already discovered that some of the china was broken--it is\r\nimpossible to have any secrets from an old servant--I was not in a\r\npleasant humor myself.  Warner brought up the afternoon mail and the\r\nevening papers at seven--I was curious to know what the papers said of\r\nthe murder.  We had turned away at least a dozen reporters.  But I read\r\nover the head-line that ran half-way across the top of the Gazette\r\ntwice before I comprehended it.  Halsey had opened the Chronicle and\r\nwas staring at it fixedly.\r\n\r\n\"The Traders' Bank closes its doors!\" was what I read, and then I put\r\ndown the paper and looked across the table.\r\n\r\n\"Did you know of this?\" I asked Halsey.\r\n\r\n\"I expected it.  But not so soon,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"And you?\" to Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\"Jack--told us--something,\" Gertrude said faintly.  \"Oh, Halsey, what\r\ncan he do now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jack!\" I said scornfully.  \"Your Jack's flight is easy enough to\r\nexplain now.  And you helped him, both of you, to get away!  You get\r\nthat from your mother; it isn't an Innes trait. Do you know that every\r\ndollar you have, both of you, is in that bank?\"\r\n\r\nGertrude tried to speak, but Halsey stopped her.\r\n\r\n\"That isn't all, Gertrude,\" he said quietly; \"Jack is--under arrest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Under arrest!\" Gertrude screamed, and tore the paper out of his hand.\r\nShe glanced at the heading, then she crumpled the newspaper into a ball\r\nand flung it to the floor.  While Halsey, looking stricken and white,\r\nwas trying to smooth it out and read it, Gertrude had dropped her head\r\non the table and was sobbing stormily.\r\n\r\nI have the clipping somewhere, but just now I can remember only the\r\nessentials.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon before, Monday, while the Traders' Bank was in the\r\nrush of closing hour, between two and three, Mr. Jacob Trautman,\r\nPresident of the Pearl Brewing Company, came into the bank to lift a\r\nloan.  As security for the loan he had deposited some three hundred\r\nInternational Steamship Company 5's, in total value three hundred\r\nthousand dollars.  Mr. Trautman went to the loan clerk and, after\r\ncertain formalities had been gone through, the loan clerk went to the\r\nvault.  Mr. Trautman, who was a large and genial German, waited for a\r\ntime, whistling under his breath.  The loan clerk did not come back.\r\nAfter an interval, Mr. Trautman saw the loan clerk emerge from the\r\nvault and go to the assistant cashier: the two went hurriedly to the\r\nvault.  A lapse of another ten minutes, and the assistant cashier came\r\nout and approached Mr. Trautman.  He was noticeably white and\r\ntrembling.  Mr. Trautman was told that through an oversight the bonds\r\nhad been misplaced, and was asked to return the following morning, when\r\neverything would be made all right.\r\n\r\nMr. Trautman, however, was a shrewd business man, and he did not like\r\nthe appearance of things.  He left the bank apparently satisfied, and\r\nwithin thirty minutes he had called up three different members of the\r\nTraders' Board of Directors.  At three-thirty there was a hastily\r\nconvened board meeting, with some stormy scenes, and late in the\r\nafternoon a national bank examiner was in possession of the books.  The\r\nbank had not opened for business on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nAt twelve-thirty o'clock the Saturday before, as soon as the business\r\nof the day was closed, Mr. John Bailey, the cashier of the defunct\r\nbank, had taken his hat and departed.  During the afternoon he had\r\ncalled up Mr. Aronson, a member of the board, and said he was ill, and\r\nmight not be at the bank for a day or two.  As Bailey was highly\r\nthought of, Mr. Aronson merely expressed a regret.  From that time\r\nuntil Monday night, when Mr. Bailey had surrendered to the police,\r\nlittle was known of his movements.  Some time after one on Saturday he\r\nhad entered the Western Union office at Cherry and White Streets and\r\nhad sent two telegrams.  He was at the Greenwood Country Club on\r\nSaturday night, and appeared unlike himself.  It was reported that he\r\nwould be released under enormous bond, some time that day, Tuesday.\r\n\r\nThe article closed by saying that while the officers of the bank\r\nrefused to talk until the examiner had finished his work, it was known\r\nthat securities aggregating a million and a quarter were missing.  Then\r\nthere was a diatribe on the possibility of such an occurrence; on the\r\nfolly of a one-man bank, and of a Board of Directors that met only to\r\nlunch together and to listen to a brief report from the cashier, and on\r\nthe poor policy of a government that arranges a three or four-day\r\nexamination twice a year.  The mystery, it insinuated, had not been\r\ncleared by the arrest of the cashier.  Before now minor officials had\r\nbeen used to cloak the misdeeds of men higher up.  Inseparable as the\r\nwords \"speculation\" and \"peculation\" have grown to be, John Bailey was\r\nnot known to be in the stock market.  His only words, after his\r\nsurrender, had been \"Send for Mr. Armstrong at once.\" The telegraph\r\nmessage which had finally reached the President of the Traders' Bank,\r\nin an interior town in California, had been responded to by a telegram\r\nfrom Doctor Walker, the young physician who was traveling with the\r\nArmstrong family, saying that Paul Armstrong was very ill and unable to\r\ntravel.\r\n\r\nThat was how things stood that Tuesday evening.  The Traders' Bank had\r\nsuspended payment, and John Bailey was under arrest, charged with\r\nwrecking it; Paul Armstrong lay very ill in California, and his only\r\nson had been murdered two days before. I sat dazed and bewildered.  The\r\nchildren's money was gone: that was bad enough, though I had plenty, if\r\nthey would let me share. But Gertrude's grief was beyond any power of\r\nmine to comfort; the man she had chosen stood accused of a colossal\r\nembezzlement--and even worse.  For in the instant that I sat there I\r\nseemed to see the coils closing around John Bailey as the murderer of\r\nArnold Armstrong.\r\n\r\nGertrude lifted her head at last and stared across the table at Halsey.\r\n\r\n\"Why did he do it?\" she wailed.  \"Couldn't you stop him, Halsey? It was\r\nsuicidal to go back!\"\r\n\r\nHalsey was looking steadily through the windows of the breakfast-room,\r\nbut it was evident he saw nothing.\r\n\r\n\"It was the only thing he could do, Trude,\" he said at last. \"Aunt Ray,\r\nwhen I found Jack at the Greenwood Club last Saturday night, he was\r\nfrantic.  I can not talk until Jack tells me I may, but--he is\r\nabsolutely innocent of all this, believe me.  I thought, Trude and I\r\nthought, we were helping him, but it was the wrong way.  He came back.\r\nIsn't that the act of an innocent man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why did he leave at all?\" I asked, unconvinced.  \"What innocent\r\nman would run away from here at three o'clock in the morning?  Doesn't\r\nit look rather as though he thought it impossible to escape?\"\r\n\r\nGertrude rose angrily.  \"You are not even just!\" she flamed. \"You don't\r\nknow anything about it, and you condemn him!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that we have all lost a great deal of money,\" I said.  \"I shall\r\nbelieve Mr. Bailey innocent the moment he is shown to be. You profess\r\nto know the truth, but you can not tell me!  What am I to think?\"\r\n\r\nHalsey leaned over and patted my hand.\r\n\r\n\"You must take us on faith,\" he said.  \"Jack Bailey hasn't a penny that\r\ndoesn't belong to him; the guilty man will be known in a day or so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall believe that when it is proved,\" I said grimly.  \"In the\r\nmeantime, I take no one on faith.  The Inneses never do.\"\r\n\r\nGertrude, who had been standing aloof at a window, turned suddenly.\r\n\"But when the bonds are offered for sale, Halsey, won't the thief be\r\ndetected at once?\"\r\n\r\nHalsey turned with a superior smile.\r\n\r\n\"It wouldn't be done that way,\" he said.  \"They would be taken out of\r\nthe vault by some one who had access to it, and used as collateral for\r\na loan in another bank.  It would be possible to realize eighty per\r\ncent. of their face value.\"\r\n\r\n\"In cash?\"\r\n\r\n\"In cash.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the man who did it--he would be known?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  I tell you both, as sure as I stand here, I believe that Paul\r\nArmstrong looted his own bank.  I believe he has a million at least, as\r\nthe result, and that he will never come back.  I'm worse than a pauper\r\nnow.  I can't ask Louise to share nothing a year with me and when I\r\nthink of this disgrace for her, I'm crazy.\"\r\n\r\nThe most ordinary events of life seemed pregnant with possibilities\r\nthat day, and when Halsey was called to the telephone, I ceased all\r\npretense at eating.  When he came back from the telephone his face\r\nshowed that something had occurred. He waited, however, until Thomas\r\nleft the dining-room: then he told us.\r\n\r\n\"Paul Armstrong is dead,\" he announced gravely.  \"He died this morning\r\nin California.  Whatever he did, he is beyond the law now.\"\r\n\r\nGertrude turned pale.\r\n\r\n\"And the only man who could have cleared Jack can never do it!\" she\r\nsaid despairingly.\r\n\r\n\"Also,\" I replied coldly, \"Mr. Armstrong is for ever beyond the power\r\nof defending himself.  When your Jack comes to me, with some two\r\nhundred thousand dollars in his hands, which is about what you have\r\nlost, I shall believe him innocent.\"\r\n\r\nHalsey threw his cigarette away and turned on me.\r\n\r\n\"There you go!\" he exclaimed.  \"If he was the thief, he could return\r\nthe money, of course.  If he is innocent, he probably hasn't a tenth of\r\nthat amount in the world.  In his hands! That's like a woman.\"\r\n\r\nGertrude, who had been pale and despairing during the early part of the\r\nconversation, had flushed an indignant red.  She got up and drew\r\nherself to her slender height, looking down at me with the scorn of the\r\nyoung and positive.\r\n\r\n\"You are the only mother I ever had,\" she said tensely.  \"I have given\r\nyou all I would have given my mother, had she lived--my love, my trust.\r\nAnd now, when I need you most, you fail me.  I tell you, John Bailey is\r\na good man, an honest man.  If you say he is not, you--you--\"\r\n\r\n\"Gertrude,\" Halsey broke in sharply.  She dropped beside the table and,\r\nburying her face in her arms broke into a storm of tears.\r\n\r\n\"I love him--love him,\" she sobbed, in a surrender that was totally\r\nunlike her.  \"Oh, I never thought it would be like this. I can't bear\r\nit. I can't.\"\r\n\r\nHalsey and I stood helpless before the storm.  I would have tried to\r\ncomfort her, but she had put me away, and there was something aloof in\r\nher grief, something new and strange.  At last, when her sorrow had\r\nsubsided to the dry shaking sobs of a tired child, without raising her\r\nhead she put out one groping hand.\r\n\r\n\"Aunt Ray!\" she whispered.  In a moment I was on my knees beside her,\r\nher arm around my neck, her cheek against my hair.\r\n\r\n\"Where am I in this?\" Halsey said suddenly and tried to put his arms\r\naround us both.  It was a welcome distraction, and Gertrude was soon\r\nherself again.  The little storm had cleared the air. Nevertheless, my\r\nopinion remained unchanged.  There was much to be cleared up before I\r\nwould consent to any renewal of my acquaintance with John Bailey.  And\r\nHalsey and Gertrude knew it, knowing me.\r\n\nIt was about half-past eight when we left the dining-room and still\r\nengrossed with one subject, the failure of the bank and its attendant\r\nevils Halsey and I went out into the grounds for a stroll Gertrude\r\nfollowed us shortly.  \"The light was thickening,\" to appropriate\r\nShakespeare's description of twilight, and once again the tree-toads\r\nand the crickets were making night throb with their tiny life.  It was\r\nalmost oppressively lonely, in spite of its beauty, and I felt a\r\nsickening pang of homesickness for my city at night--for the clatter of\r\nhorses' feet on cemented paving, for the lights, the voices, the sound\r\nof children playing.  The country after dark oppresses me.  The stars,\r\nquite eclipsed in the city by the electric lights, here become\r\ninsistent, assertive.  Whether I want to or not, I find myself looking\r\nfor the few I know by name, and feeling ridiculously new and small by\r\ncontrast--always an unpleasant sensation.\r\n\r\nAfter Gertrude joined us, we avoided any further mention of the murder.\r\nTo Halsey, as to me, there was ever present, I am sure, the thought of\r\nour conversation of the night before.  As we strolled back and forth\r\nalong the drive, Mr. Jamieson emerged from the shadow of the trees.\r\n\r\n\"Good evening,\" he said, managing to include Gertrude in his bow.\r\n\r\nGertrude had never been even ordinarily courteous to him, and she\r\nnodded coldly.  Halsey, however, was more cordial, although we were all\r\nconstrained enough.  He and Gertrude went on together, leaving the\r\ndetective to walk with me.  As soon as they were out of earshot, he\r\nturned to me.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, Miss Innes,\" he said, \"the deeper I go into this thing,\r\nthe more strange it seems to me.  I am very sorry for Miss Gertrude.\r\nIt looks as if Bailey, whom she has tried so hard to save, is worse\r\nthan a rascal; and after her plucky fight for him, it seems hard.\"\r\n\r\nI looked through the dusk to where Gertrude's light dinner dress\r\ngleamed among the trees.  She HAD made a plucky fight, poor child.\r\nWhatever she might have been driven to do, I could find nothing but a\r\ndeep sympathy for her.  If she had only come to me with the whole truth\r\nthen!\r\n\r\n\"Miss Innes,\" Mr. Jamieson was saying, \"in the last three days, have\r\nyou seen a--any suspicious figures around the grounds? Any--woman?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I replied.  \"I have a houseful of maids that will bear watching,\r\none and all.  But there has been no strange woman near the house or\r\nLiddy would have seen her, you may be sure.  She has a telescopic eye.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson looked thoughtful.\r\n\r\n\"It may not amount to anything,\" he said slowly.  \"It is difficult to\r\nget any perspective on things around here, because every one down in\r\nthe village is sure he saw the murderer, either before or since the\r\ncrime.  And half of them will stretch a point or two as to facts, to be\r\nobliging.  But the man who drives the hack down there tells a story\r\nthat may possibly prove to be important.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard it, I think.  Was it the one the parlor maid brought up\r\nyesterday, about a ghost wringing its hands on the roof?  Or perhaps\r\nit's the one the milk-boy heard: a tramp washing a dirty shirt,\r\npresumably bloody, in the creek below the bridge?\"\r\n\r\nI could see the gleam of Mr. Jamieson's teeth, as he smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Neither,\" he said.  \"But Matthew Geist, which is our friend's name,\r\nclaims that on Saturday night, at nine-thirty, a veiled lady--\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew it would be a veiled lady,\" I broke in.\r\n\r\n\"A veiled lady,\" he persisted, \"who was apparently young and beautiful,\r\nengaged his hack and asked to be driven to Sunnyside. Near the gate,\r\nhowever, she made him stop, in spite of his remonstrances, saying she\r\npreferred to walk to the house.  She paid him, and he left her there.\r\nNow, Miss Innes, you had no such visitor, I believe?\"\r\n\r\n\"None,\" I said decidedly.\r\n\r\n\"Geist thought it might be a maid, as you had got a supply that day.\r\nBut he said her getting out near the gate puzzled him. Anyhow, we have\r\nnow one veiled lady, who, with the ghostly intruder of Friday night,\r\nmakes two assets that I hardly know what to do with.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is mystifying,\" I admitted, \"although I can think of one possible\r\nexplanation.  The path from the Greenwood Club to the village enters\r\nthe road near the lodge gate.  A woman who wished to reach the Country\r\nClub, unperceived, might choose such a method.  There are plenty of\r\nwomen there.\"\r\n\r\nI think this gave him something to ponder, for in a short time he said\r\ngood night and left.  But I myself was far from satisfied. I was\r\ndetermined, however, on one thing.  If my suspicions--for I had\r\nsuspicions--were true, I would make my own investigations, and Mr.\r\nJamieson should learn only what was good for him to know.\r\n\r\nWe went back to the house, and Gertrude, who was more like herself\r\nsince her talk with Halsey, sat down at the mahogany desk in the\r\nliving-room to write a letter.  Halsey prowled up and down the entire\r\neast wing, now in the card-room, now in the billiard-room, and now and\r\nthen blowing his clouds of tobacco smoke among the pink and gold\r\nhangings of the drawing-room.  After a little I joined him in the\r\nbilliard-room, and together we went over the details of the discovery\r\nof the body.\r\n\r\nThe card-room was quite dark.  Where we sat, in the billiard-room, only\r\none of the side brackets was lighted, and we spoke in subdued tones, as\r\nthe hour and the subject seemed to demand. When I spoke of the figure\r\nLiddy and I had seen on the porch through the card-room window Friday\r\nnight, Halsey sauntered into the darkened room, and together we stood\r\nthere, much as Liddy and I had done that other night.\r\n\r\nThe window was the same grayish rectangle in the blackness as before.\r\nA few feet away in the hall was the spot where the body of Arnold\r\nArmstrong had been found.  I was a bit nervous, and I put my hand on\r\nHalsey's sleeve.  Suddenly, from the top of the staircase above us came\r\nthe sound of a cautious footstep.  At first I was not sure, but\r\nHalsey's attitude told me he had heard and was listening.  The step,\r\nslow, measured, infinitely cautious, was nearer now.  Halsey tried to\r\nloosen my fingers, but I was in a paralysis of fright.\r\n\r\nThe swish of a body against the curving rail, as if for guidance, was\r\nplain enough, and now whoever it was had reached the foot of the\r\nstaircase and had caught a glimpse of our rigid silhouettes against the\r\nbilliard-room doorway.  Halsey threw me off then and strode forward.\r\n\r\n\"Who is it?\" he called imperiously, and took a half dozen rapid strides\r\ntoward the foot of the staircase.  Then I heard him mutter something;\r\nthere was the crash of a falling body, the slam of the outer door, and,\r\nfor an instant, quiet.  I screamed, I think.  Then I remember turning\r\non the lights and finding Halsey, white with fury, trying to untangle\r\nhimself from something warm and fleecy.  He had cut his forehead a\r\nlittle on the lowest step of the stairs, and he was rather a ghastly\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nHe flung the white object at me, and, jerking open the outer door,\r\nraced into the darkness.\r\n\r\nGertrude had come on hearing the noise, and now we stood, staring at\r\neach other over--of all things on earth--a white silk and wool blanket,\r\nexquisitely fine!  It was the most unghostly thing in the world, with\r\nits lavender border and its faint scent. Gertrude was the first to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n\"Somebody--had it?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  Halsey tried to stop whoever it was and fell.  Gertrude, that\r\nblanket is not mine.  I have never seen before.\"\r\n\r\nShe held it up and looked at it: then she went to the door on to the\r\nveranda and threw it open.  Perhaps a hundred feet from the house were\r\ntwo figures, that moved slowly toward us as we looked.\r\n\r\nWhen they came within range of the light, I recognized Halsey, and with\r\nhim Mrs. Watson, the housekeeper.\r\n\nThe most commonplace incident takes on a new appearance if the\r\nattendant circumstances are unusual.  There was no reason on earth why\r\nMrs. Watson should not have carried a blanket down the east wing\r\nstaircase, if she so desired.  But to take a blanket down at eleven\r\no'clock at night, with every precaution as to noise, and, when\r\ndiscovered, to fling it at Halsey and bolt--Halsey's word, and a good\r\none--into the grounds,--this made the incident more than significant.\r\n\r\nThey moved slowly across the lawn and up the steps.  Halsey was talking\r\nquietly, and Mrs. Watson was looking down and listening. She was a\r\nwoman of a certain amount of dignity, most efficient, so far as I could\r\nsee, although Liddy would have found fault if she dared.  But just now\r\nMrs. Watson's face was an enigma.  She was defiant, I think, under her\r\nmask of submission, and she still showed the effect of nervous shock.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Watson,\" I said severely, \"will you be so good as to explain this\r\nrather unusual occurrence?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think it so unusual, Miss Innes.\"  Her voice was deep and very\r\nclear: just now it was somewhat tremulous.  \"I was taking a blanket\r\ndown to Thomas, who is--not well to-night, and I used this staircase,\r\nas being nearer the path to the lodge. When--Mr. Innes called and then\r\nrushed at me, I--I was alarmed, and flung the blanket at him.\"\r\n\r\nHalsey was examining the cut on his forehead in a small mirror on the\r\nwall.  It was not much of an injury, but it had bled freely, and his\r\nappearance was rather terrifying.\r\n\r\n\"Thomas ill?\" he said, over his shoulder.  \"Why, _I_ thought I saw\r\nThomas out there as you made that cyclonic break out of the door and\r\nover the porch.\"\r\n\r\nI could see that under pretense of examining his injury he was watching\r\nher through the mirror.\r\n\r\n\"Is this one of the servants' blankets, Mrs. Watson?\" I asked, holding\r\nup its luxurious folds to the light.\r\n\r\n\"Everything else is locked away,\" she replied.  Which was true enough,\r\nno doubt.  I had rented the house without bed furnishings.\r\n\r\n\"If Thomas is ill,\" Halsey said, \"some member of the family ought to go\r\ndown to see him.  You needn't bother, Mrs. Watson.  I will take the\r\nblanket.\"\r\n\r\nShe drew herself up quickly, as if in protest, but she found nothing to\r\nsay.  She stood smoothing the folds of her dead black dress, her face\r\nas white as chalk above it.  Then she seemed to make up her mind.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Mr. Innes,\" she said.  \"Perhaps you would better go. I have\r\ndone all I could.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then she turned and went up the circular staircase, moving slowly\r\nand with a certain dignity.  Below, the three of us stared at one\r\nanother across the intervening white blanket.\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word,\" Halsey broke out, \"this place is a walking nightmare.\r\nI have the feeling that we three outsiders who have paid our money for\r\nthe privilege of staying in this spook-factory, are living on the very\r\ntop of things.  We're on the lid, so to speak.  Now and then we get a\r\nsight of the things inside, but we are not a part of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose,\" Gertrude asked doubtfully, \"that she really meant\r\nthat blanket for Thomas?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thomas was standing beside that magnolia tree,\" Halsey replied, \"when\r\nI ran after Mrs. Watson.  It's down to this, Aunt Ray. Rosie's basket\r\nand Mrs. Watson's blanket can only mean one thing: there is somebody\r\nhiding or being hidden in the lodge.  It wouldn't surprise me if we\r\nhold the key to the whole situation now.  Anyhow, I'm going to the\r\nlodge to investigate.\"\r\n\r\nGertrude wanted to go, too, but she looked so shaken that I insisted\r\nshe should not.  I sent for Liddy to help her to bed, and then Halsey\r\nand I started for the lodge.  The grass was heavy with dew, and,\r\nman-like, Halsey chose the shortest way across the lawn.  Half-way,\r\nhowever, he stopped.\r\n\r\n\"We'd better go by the drive,\" he said.  \"This isn't a lawn; it's a\r\nfield.  Where's the gardener these days?\"\r\n\r\n\"There isn't any,\" I said meekly.  \"We have been thankful enough, so\r\nfar, to have our meals prepared and served and the beds aired. The\r\ngardener who belongs here is working at the club.\"\r\n\r\n\"Remind me to-morrow to send out a man from town,\" he said.  \"I know\r\nthe very fellow.\"\r\n\r\nI record this scrap of conversation, just as I have tried to put down\r\nanything and everything that had a bearing on what followed, because\r\nthe gardener Halsey sent the next day played an important part in the\r\nevents of the next few weeks--events that culminated, as you know, by\r\nstirring the country profoundly.  At that time, however, I was busy\r\ntrying to keep my skirts dry, and paid little or no attention to what\r\nseemed then a most trivial remark.\r\n\r\nAlong the drive I showed Halsey where I had found Rosie's basket with\r\nthe bits of broken china piled inside.  He was rather skeptical.\r\n\r\n\"Warner probably,\" he said when I had finished.  \"Began it as a joke on\r\nRosie, and ended by picking up the broken china out of the road,\r\nknowing it would play hob with the tires of the car.\" Which shows how\r\nnear one can come to the truth, and yet miss it altogether.\r\n\r\nAt the lodge everything was quiet.  There was a light in the\r\nsitting-room down-stairs, and a faint gleam, as if from a shaded lamp,\r\nin one of the upper rooms.  Halsey stopped and examined the lodge with\r\ncalculating eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, Aunt Ray,\" he said dubiously; \"this is hardly a woman's\r\naffair.  If there's a scrap of any kind, you hike for the timber.\"\r\nWhich was Halsey's solicitous care for me, put into vernacular.\r\n\r\n\"I shall stay right here,\" I said, and crossing the small veranda, now\r\nshaded and fragrant with honeysuckle, I hammered the knocker on the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThomas opened the door himself--Thomas, fully dressed and in his\r\ncustomary health.  I had the blanket over my arm.\r\n\r\n\"I brought the blanket, Thomas,\" I said; \"I am sorry you are so ill.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man stood staring at me and then at the blanket.  His confusion\r\nunder other circumstances would have been ludicrous.\r\n\r\n\"What!  Not ill?\" Halsey said from the step.  \"Thomas, I'm afraid\r\nyou've been malingering.\"\r\n\r\nThomas seemed to have been debating something with himself.  Now he\r\nstepped out on the porch and closed the door gently behind him.\r\n\r\n\"I reckon you bettah come in, Mis' Innes,\" he said, speaking\r\ncautiously.  \"It's got so I dunno what to do, and it's boun' to come\r\nout some time er ruther.\"\r\n\r\nHe threw the door open then, and I stepped inside, Halsey close behind.\r\nIn the sitting-room the old negro turned with quiet dignity to Halsey.\r\n\r\n\"You bettah sit down, sah,\" he said.  \"It's a place for a woman, sah.\"\r\n\r\nThings were not turning out the way Halsey expected.  He sat down on\r\nthe center-table, with his hands thrust in his pockets, and watched me\r\nas I followed Thomas up the narrow stairs.  At the top a woman was\r\nstanding, and a second glance showed me it was Rosie.\r\n\r\nShe shrank back a little, but I said nothing.  And then Thomas motioned\r\nto a partly open door, and I went in.\r\n\r\nThe lodge boasted three bedrooms up-stairs, all comfortably furnished.\r\nIn this one, the largest and airiest, a night lamp was burning, and by\r\nits light I could make out a plain white metal bed.  A girl was asleep\r\nthere--or in a half stupor, for she muttered something now and then.\r\nRosie had taken her courage in her hands, and coming in had turned up\r\nthe light.  It was only then that I knew.  Fever-flushed, ill as she\r\nwas, I recognized Louise Armstrong.\r\n\r\nI stood gazing down at her in a stupor of amazement.  Louise here,\r\nhiding at the lodge, ill and alone!  Rosie came up to the bed and\r\nsmoothed the white counterpane.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid she is worse to-night,\" she ventured at last. I put my\r\nhand on the sick girl's forehead.  It was burning with fever, and I\r\nturned to where Thomas lingered in the hallway.\r\n\r\n\"Will you tell me what you mean, Thomas Johnson, by not telling me this\r\nbefore?\" I demanded indignantly.\r\n\r\nThomas quailed.\r\n\r\n\"Mis' Louise wouldn' let me,\" he said earnestly.  \"I wanted to. She\r\nought to 'a' had a doctor the night she came, but she wouldn' hear to\r\nit.  Is she--is she very bad, Mis' Innes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bad enough,\" I said coldly.  \"Send Mr. Innes up.\"\r\n\r\nHalsey came up the stairs slowly, looking rather interested and\r\ninclined to be amused.  For a moment he could not see anything\r\ndistinctly in the darkened room; he stopped, glanced at Rosie and at\r\nme, and then his eyes fell on the restless head on the pillow.\r\n\r\nI think he felt who it was before he really saw her; he crossed the\r\nroom in a couple of strides and bent over the bed.\r\n\r\n\"Louise!\" he said softly; but she did not reply, and her eyes showed no\r\nrecognition.  Halsey was young, and illness was new to him.  He\r\nstraightened himself slowly, still watching her, and caught my arm.\r\n\r\n\"She's dying, Aunt Ray!\" he said huskily.  \"Dying!  Why, she doesn't\r\nknow me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Fudge!\" I snapped, being apt to grow irritable when my sympathies are\r\naroused.  \"She's doing nothing of the sort,--and don't pinch my arm.\r\nIf you want something to do, go and choke Thomas.\"\r\n\r\nBut at that moment Louise roused from her stupor to cough, and at the\r\nend of the paroxysm, as Rosie laid her back, exhausted, she knew us.\r\nThat was all Halsey wanted; to him consciousness was recovery.  He\r\ndropped on his knees beside the bed, and tried to tell her she was all\r\nright, and we would bring her around in a hurry, and how beautiful she\r\nlooked--only to break down utterly and have to stop.  And at that I\r\ncame to my senses, and put him out.\r\n\r\n\"This instant!\" I ordered, as he hesitated.  \"And send Rosie here.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not go far.  He sat on the top step of the stairs, only leaving\r\nto telephone for a doctor, and getting in everybody's way in his\r\neagerness to fetch and carry.  I got him away finally, by sending him\r\nto fix up the car as a sort of ambulance, in case the doctor would\r\nallow the sick girl to be moved.  He sent Gertrude down to the lodge\r\nloaded with all manner of impossible things, including an armful of\r\nTurkish towels and a box of mustard plasters, and as the two girls had\r\nknown each other somewhat before, Louise brightened perceptibly when\r\nshe saw her.\r\n\r\nWhen the doctor from Englewood--the Casanova doctor, Doctor Walker,\r\nbeing away--had started for Sunnyside, and I had got Thomas to stop\r\ntrying to explain what he did not understand himself, I had a long talk\r\nwith the old man, and this is what I learned.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday evening before, about ten o'clock, he had been reading in\r\nthe sitting-room down-stairs, when some one rapped at the door.  The\r\nold man was alone, Warner not having arrived, and at first he was\r\nuncertain about opening the door.  He did so finally, and was amazed at\r\nbeing confronted by Louise Armstrong. Thomas was an old family servant,\r\nhaving been with the present Mrs. Armstrong since she was a child, and\r\nhe was overwhelmed at seeing Louise.  He saw that she was excited and\r\ntired, and he drew her into the sitting-room and made her sit down.\r\nAfter a while he went to the house and brought Mrs. Watson, and they\r\ntalked until late.  The old man said Louise was in trouble, and seemed\r\nfrightened.  Mrs. Watson made some tea and took it to the lodge, but\r\nLouise made them both promise to keep her presence a secret.  She had\r\nnot known that Sunnyside was rented, and whatever her trouble was, this\r\ncomplicated things.  She seemed puzzled.  Her stepfather and her mother\r\nwere still in California--that was all she would say about them.  Why\r\nshe had run away no one could imagine.  Mr. Arnold Armstrong was at the\r\nGreenwood Club, and at last Thomas, not knowing what else to do, went\r\nover there along the path.  It was almost midnight. Part-way over he\r\nmet Armstrong himself and brought him to the lodge. Mrs. Watson had\r\ngone to the house for some bed-linen, it having been arranged that\r\nunder the circumstances Louise would be better at the lodge until\r\nmorning.  Arnold Armstrong and Louise had a long conference, during\r\nwhich he was heard to storm and become very violent.  When he left it\r\nwas after two.  He had gone up to the house--Thomas did not know\r\nwhy--and at three o'clock he was shot at the foot of the circular\r\nstaircase.\r\n\r\nThe following morning Louise had been ill.  She had asked for Arnold,\r\nand was told he had left town.  Thomas had not the moral courage to\r\ntell her of the crime.  She refused a doctor, and shrank morbidly from\r\nhaving her presence known.  Mrs. Watson and Thomas had had their hands\r\nfull, and at last Rosie had been enlisted to help them.  She carried\r\nnecessary provisions--little enough--to the lodge, and helped to keep\r\nthe secret.\r\n\r\nThomas told me quite frankly that he had been anxious to keep Louise's\r\npresence hidden for this reason: they had all seen Arnold Armstrong\r\nthat night, and he, himself, for one, was known to have had no very\r\nfriendly feeling for the dead man.  As to the reason for Louise's\r\nflight from California, or why she had not gone to the Fitzhughs', or\r\nto some of her people in town, he had no more information than I had.\r\nWith the death of her stepfather and the prospect of the immediate\r\nreturn of the family, things had become more and more impossible.  I\r\ngathered that Thomas was as relieved as I at the turn events had taken.\r\nNo, she did not know of either of the deaths in the family.\r\n\r\nTaken all around, I had only substituted one mystery for another.\r\n\r\nIf I knew now why Rosie had taken the basket of dishes, I did not know\r\nwho had spoken to her and followed her along the drive.  If I knew that\r\nLouise was in the lodge, I did not know why she was there.  If I knew\r\nthat Arnold Armstrong had spent some time in the lodge the night before\r\nhe was murdered, I was no nearer the solution of the crime.  Who was\r\nthe midnight intruder who had so alarmed Liddy and myself?  Who had\r\nfallen down the clothes chute?  Was Gertrude's lover a villain or a\r\nvictim?  Time was to answer all these things.\r\n\nThe doctor from Englewood came very soon, and I went up to see the sick\r\ngirl with him.  Halsey had gone to supervise the fitting of the car\r\nwith blankets and pillows, and Gertrude was opening and airing Louise's\r\nown rooms at the house.  Her private sitting-room, bedroom and\r\ndressing-room were as they had been when we came.  They occupied the\r\nend of the east wing, beyond the circular staircase, and we had not\r\neven opened them.\r\n\r\nThe girl herself was too ill to notice what was being done. When, with\r\nthe help of the doctor, who was a fatherly man with a family of girls\r\nat home, we got her to the house and up the stairs into bed, she\r\ndropped into a feverish sleep, which lasted until morning.  Doctor\r\nStewart--that was the Englewood doctor--stayed almost all night, giving\r\nthe medicine himself, and watching her closely.  Afterward he told me\r\nthat she had had a narrow escape from pneumonia, and that the cerebral\r\nsymptoms had been rather alarming.  I said I was glad it wasn't an\r\n\"itis\" of some kind, anyhow, and he smiled solemnly.\r\n\r\nHe left after breakfast, saying that he thought the worst of the danger\r\nwas over, and that she must be kept very quiet.\r\n\r\n\"The shock of two deaths, I suppose, has done this,\" he remarked,\r\npicking up his case.  \"It has been very deplorable.\"\r\n\r\nI hastened to set him right.\r\n\r\n\"She does not know of either, Doctor,\" I said.  \"Please do not mention\r\nthem to her.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked as surprised as a medical man ever does.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know the family,\" he said, preparing to get into his top\r\nbuggy.  \"Young Walker, down in Casanova, has been attending them.  I\r\nunderstand he is going to marry this young lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been misinformed,\" I said stiffly.  \"Miss Armstrong is going\r\nto marry my nephew.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor smiled as he picked up the reins.\r\n\r\n\"Young ladies are changeable these days,\" he said.  \"We thought the\r\nwedding was to occur soon.  Well, I will stop in this afternoon to see\r\nhow my patient is getting along.\"\r\n\r\nHe drove away then, and I stood looking after him.  He was a doctor of\r\nthe old school, of the class of family practitioner that is fast dying\r\nout; a loyal and honorable gentleman who was at once physician and\r\nconfidential adviser to his patients.  When I was a girl we called in\r\nthe doctor alike when we had measles, or when mother's sister died in\r\nthe far West.  He cut out redundant tonsils and brought the babies with\r\nthe same air of inspiring self-confidence.  Nowadays it requires a\r\ndifferent specialist for each of these occurrences.  When the babies\r\ncried, old Doctor Wainwright gave them peppermint and dropped warm\r\nsweet oil in their ears with sublime faith that if it was not colic it\r\nwas earache.  When, at the end of a year, father met him driving in his\r\nhigh side-bar buggy with the white mare ambling along, and asked for a\r\nbill, the doctor used to go home, estimate what his services were worth\r\nfor that period, divide it in half--I don't think he kept any\r\nbooks--and send father a statement, in a cramped hand, on a sheet of\r\nruled white paper.  He was an honored guest at all the weddings,\r\nchristenings, and funerals--yes, funerals--for every one knew he had\r\ndone his best, and there was no gainsaying the ways of Providence.\r\n\r\nAh, well, Doctor Wainwright is gone, and I am an elderly woman with an\r\nincreasing tendency to live in the past.  The contrast between my old\r\ndoctor at home and the Casanova doctor, Frank Walker, always rouses me\r\nto wrath and digression.\r\n\r\nSome time about noon of that day, Wednesday, Mrs. Ogden Fitzhugh\r\ntelephoned me.  I have the barest acquaintance with her--she managed to\r\nbe put on the governing board of the Old Ladies' Home and ruins their\r\ndigestions by sending them ice-cream and cake on every holiday.  Beyond\r\nthat, and her reputation at bridge, which is insufferably bad--she is\r\nthe worst player at the bridge club--I know little of her.  It was she\r\nwho had taken charge of Arnold Armstrong's funeral, however, and I went\r\nat once to the telephone.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"this is Miss Innes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Innes,\" she said volubly, \"I have just received a very strange\r\ntelegram from my cousin, Mrs. Armstrong.  Her husband died yesterday,\r\nin California and--wait, I will read you the message.\"\r\n\r\nI knew what was coming, and I made up my mind at once.  If Louise\r\nArmstrong had a good and sufficient reason for leaving her people and\r\ncoming home, a reason, moreover, that kept her from going at once to\r\nMrs. Ogden Fitzhugh, and that brought her to the lodge at Sunnyside\r\ninstead, it was not my intention to betray her.  Louise herself must\r\nnotify her people.  I do not justify myself now, but remember, I was in\r\na peculiar position toward the Armstrong family.  I was connected most\r\nunpleasantly with a cold-blooded crime, and my niece and nephew were\r\npractically beggared, either directly or indirectly, through the head\r\nof the family.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fitzhugh had found the message.\r\n\r\n\"'Paul died yesterday.  Heart disease,'\" she read.  \"'Wire at once if\r\nLouise is with you.'  You see, Miss Innes, Louise must have started\r\neast, and Fanny is alarmed about her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Louise is not here,\" Mrs. Fitzhugh went on, \"and none of her\r\nfriends--the few who are still in town--has seen her.  I called you\r\nbecause Sunnyside was not rented when she went away, and Louise might\r\nhave, gone there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry, Mrs. Fitzhugh, but I can not help you,\" I said, and was\r\nimmediately filled with compunction.  Suppose Louise grew worse?  Who\r\nwas I to play Providence in this case?  The anxious mother certainly\r\nhad a right to know that her daughter was in good hands.  So I broke in\r\non Mrs. Fitzhugh's voluble excuses for disturbing me.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Fitzhugh,\" I said.  \"I was going to let you think I knew nothing\r\nabout Louise Armstrong, but I have changed my mind. Louise is here,\r\nwith me.\"  There was a clatter of ejaculations at the other end of the\r\nwire.  \"She is ill, and not able to be moved.  Moreover, she is unable\r\nto see any one.  I wish you would wire her mother that she is with me,\r\nand tell her not to worry. No, I do not know why she came east.\"\r\n\r\n\"But my dear Miss Innes!\" Mrs. Fitzhugh began.  I cut in ruthlessly.\r\n\r\n\"I will send for you as soon as she can see you,\" I said.  \"No, she is\r\nnot in a critical state now, but the doctor says she must have absolute\r\nquiet.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I had hung up the receiver, I sat down to think.  So Louise had\r\nfled from her people in California, and had come east alone! It was not\r\na new idea, but why had she done it?  It occurred to me that Doctor\r\nWalker might be concerned in it, might possibly have bothered her with\r\nunwelcome attentions; but it seemed to me that Louise was hardly a girl\r\nto take refuge in flight under such circumstances.  She had always been\r\nhigh-spirited, with the well-poised head and buoyant step of the\r\noutdoors girl. It must have been much more in keeping with Louise's\r\ncharacter, as I knew it, to resent vigorously any unwelcome attentions\r\nfrom Doctor Walker.  It was the suitor whom I should have expected to\r\nsee in headlong flight, not the lady in the case.\r\n\r\nThe puzzle was no clearer at the end of the half-hour.  I picked up the\r\nmorning papers, which were still full of the looting of the Traders'\r\nBank, the interest at fever height again, on account of Paul\r\nArmstrong's death.  The bank examiners were working on the books, and\r\nsaid nothing for publication: John Bailey had been released on bond.\r\nThe body of Paul Armstrong would arrive Sunday and would be buried from\r\nthe Armstrong town house.  There were rumors that the dead man's estate\r\nhad been a comparatively small one.  The last paragraph was the\r\nimportant one.\r\n\r\nWalter P. Broadhurst, of the Marine Bank, had produced two hundred\r\nAmerican Traction bonds, which had been placed as security with the\r\nMarine Bank for a loan of one hundred and sixty thousand dollars, made\r\nto Paul Armstrong, just before his California trip.  The bonds were a\r\npart of the missing traction bonds from the Traders' Bank!  While this\r\ninvolved the late president of the wrecked bank, to my mind it by no\r\nmeans cleared its cashier.\r\n\r\nThe gardener mentioned by Halsey came out about two o'clock in the\r\nafternoon, and walked up from the station.  I was favorably impressed\r\nby him.  His references were good--he had been employed by the Brays'\r\nuntil they went to Europe, and he looked young and vigorous.  He asked\r\nfor one assistant, and I was glad enough to get off so easily.  He was\r\na pleasant-faced young fellow, with black hair and blue eyes, and his\r\nname was Alexander Graham.  I have been particular about Alex, because,\r\nas I said before, he played an important part later.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon I had a new insight into the character of the dead\r\nbanker.  I had my first conversation with Louise.  She sent for me, and\r\nagainst my better judgment I went.  There were so many things she could\r\nnot be told, in her weakened condition, that I dreaded the interview.\r\nIt was much easier than I expected, however, because she asked no\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nGertrude had gone to bed, having been up almost all night, and Halsey\r\nwas absent on one of those mysterious absences of his that grew more\r\nand more frequent as time went on, until it culminated in the event of\r\nthe night of June the tenth.  Liddy was in attendance in the sick-room.\r\nThere being little or nothing to do, she seemed to spend her time\r\nsmoothing the wrinkles from the counterpane.  Louise lay under a field\r\nof virgin white, folded back at an angle of geometrical exactness, and\r\nnecessitating a readjustment every time the sick girl turned.\r\n\r\nLiddy heard my approach and came out to meet me.  She seemed to be in a\r\nperpetual state of goose-flesh, and she had got in the habit of looking\r\npast me when she talked, as if she saw things. It had the effect of\r\nmaking me look over my shoulder to see what she was staring at, and was\r\nintensely irritating.\r\n\r\n\"She's awake,\" Liddy said, looking uneasily down the circular\r\nstaircase, which was beside me.  \"She was talkin' in her sleep\r\nsomething awful--about dead men and coffins.\"\r\n\r\n\"Liddy,\" I said sternly, \"did you breathe a word about everything not\r\nbeing right here?\"\r\n\r\nLiddy's gaze had wandered to the door of the chute, now bolted securely.\r\n\r\n\"Not a word,\" she said, \"beyond asking her a question or two, which\r\nthere was no harm in.  She says there never was a ghost known here.\"\r\n\r\nI glared at her, speechless, and closing the door into Louise's\r\nboudoir, to Liddy's great disappointment, I went on to the bedroom\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\nWhatever Paul Armstrong had been, he had been lavish with his\r\nstepdaughter.  Gertrude's rooms at home were always beautiful\r\napartments, but the three rooms in the east wing at Sunnyside, set\r\napart for the daughter of the house, were much more splendid.\r\n\r\nFrom the walls to the rugs on the floor, from the furniture to the\r\nappointments of the bath, with its pool sunk in the floor instead of\r\nthe customary unlovely tub, everything was luxurious. In the bedroom\r\nLouise was watching for me.  It was easy to see that she was much\r\nimproved; the flush was going, and the peculiar gasping breathing of\r\nthe night before was now a comfortable and easy respiration.\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand and I took it between both of mine.\r\n\r\n\"What can I say to you, Miss Innes?\" she said slowly.  \"To have come\r\nlike this--\"\r\n\r\nI thought she was going to break down, but she did not.\r\n\r\n\"You are not to think of anything but of getting well,\" I said, patting\r\nher hand.  \"When you are better, I am going to scold you for not coming\r\nhere at once.  This is your home, my dear, and of all people in the\r\nworld, Halsey's old aunt ought to make you welcome.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled a little, sadly, I thought.\r\n\r\n\"I ought not to see Halsey,\" she said.  \"Miss Innes, there are a great\r\nmany things you will never understand, I am afraid.  I am an impostor\r\non your sympathy, because I--I stay here and let you lavish care on me,\r\nand all the time I know you are going to despise me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" I said briskly.  \"Why, what would Halsey do to me if I even\r\nventured such a thing?  He is so big and masterful that if I dared to\r\nbe anything but rapturous over you, he would throw me out of a window.\r\nIndeed, he would be quite capable of it.\"\r\n\r\nShe seemed scarcely to hear my facetious tone.  She had eloquent brown\r\neyes--the Inneses are fair, and are prone to a grayish-green optic that\r\nis better for use than appearance--and they seemed now to be clouded\r\nwith trouble.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Halsey!\" she said softly.  \"Miss Innes, I can not marry him, and\r\nI am afraid to tell him.  I am a coward--a coward!\"\r\n\r\nI sat beside the bed and stared at her.  She was too ill to argue with,\r\nand, besides, sick people take queer fancies.\r\n\r\n\"We will talk about that when you are stronger,\" I said gently.\r\n\r\n\"But there are some things I must tell you,\" she insisted.  \"You must\r\nwonder how I came here, and why I stayed hidden at the lodge.  Dear old\r\nThomas has been almost crazy, Miss Innes.  I did not know that\r\nSunnyside was rented.  I knew my mother wished to rent it, without\r\ntelling my--stepfather, but the news must have reached her after I\r\nleft.  When I started east, I had only one idea--to be alone with my\r\nthoughts for a time, to bury myself here.  Then, I--must have taken a\r\ncold on the train.\"\r\n\r\n\"You came east in clothing suitable for California,\" I said, \"and, like\r\nall young girls nowadays, I don't suppose you wear flannels.\"  But she\r\nwas not listening.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Innes,\" she said, \"has my stepbrother Arnold gone away?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked, startled.  But Louise was literal.\r\n\r\n\"He didn't come back that night,\" she said, \"and it was so important\r\nthat I should see him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe he has gone away,\" I replied uncertainly.  \"Isn't it\r\nsomething that we could attend to instead?\"\r\n\r\nBut she shook her head.  \"I must do it myself,\" she said dully. \"My\r\nmother must have rented Sunnyside without telling my stepfather,\r\nand--Miss Innes, did you ever hear of any one being wretchedly poor in\r\nthe midst of luxury?\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever long, and long, for money--money to use without question,\r\nmoney that no one would take you to task about?  My mother and I have\r\nbeen surrounded for years with every indulgence everything that would\r\nmake a display.  But we have never had any money, Miss Innes; that must\r\nhave been why mother rented this house.  My stepfather pays our bills.\r\nIt's the most maddening, humiliating existence in the world.  I would\r\nlove honest poverty better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" I said; \"when you and Halsey are married you can be as\r\nhonest as you like, and you will certainly be poor.\"\r\n\r\nHalsey came to the door at that moment and I could hear him coaxing\r\nLiddy for admission to the sick room.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I bring him in?\" I asked Louise, uncertain what to do. The girl\r\nseemed to shrink back among her pillows at the sound of his voice.  I\r\nwas vaguely irritated with her; there are few young fellows like\r\nHalsey--straightforward, honest, and willing to sacrifice everything\r\nfor the one woman.  I knew one once, more than thirty years ago, who\r\nwas like that: he died a long time ago.  And sometimes I take out his\r\npicture, with its cane and its queer silk hat, and look at it.  But of\r\nlate years it has grown too painful: he is always a boy--and I am an\r\nold woman.  I would not bring him back if I could.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was some such memory that made me call out sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Come in, Halsey.\"  And then I took my sewing and went into the boudoir\r\nbeyond, to play propriety.  I did not try to hear what they said, but\r\nevery word came through the open door with curious distinctness.\r\nHalsey had evidently gone over to the bed and I suppose he kissed her.\r\nThere was silence for a moment, as if words were superfluous things.\r\n\r\n\"I have been almost wild, sweetheart,\"--Halsey's voice.  \"Why didn't\r\nyou trust me, and send for me before?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was because I couldn't trust myself,\" she said in a low tone.\r\n\r\n\"I am too weak to struggle to-day; oh, Halsey, how I have wanted to see\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\nThere was something I did not hear, then Halsey again.\r\n\r\n\"We could go away,\" he was saying.  \"What does it matter about any one\r\nin the world but just the two of us?  To be always together, like this,\r\nhand in hand; Louise--don't tell me it isn't going to be.  I won't\r\nbelieve you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know; you don't know,\" Louise repeated dully. \"Halsey, I\r\ncare--you know that--but--not enough to marry you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not true, Louise,\" he said sternly.  \"You can not look at me\r\nwith your honest eyes and say that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can not marry you,\" she repeated miserably.  \"It's bad enough, isn't\r\nit?  Don't make it worse.  Some day, before long, you will be glad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it is because you have never loved me.\"  There were depths of\r\nhurt pride in his voice.  \"You saw how much I loved you, and you let me\r\nthink you cared--for a while.  No--that isn't like you, Louise.  There\r\nis something you haven't told me.  Is it--because there is some one\r\nelse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" almost inaudibly.\r\n\r\n\"Louise!  Oh, I don't believe it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" she said sadly.  \"Halsey, you must not try to see me\r\nagain.  As soon as I can, I am going away from here--where you are all\r\nso much kinder than I deserve.  And whatever you hear about me, try to\r\nthink as well of me as you can.  I am going to marry--another man.  How\r\nyou must hate me--hate me!\"\r\n\r\nI could hear Halsey cross the room to the window.  Then, after a pause,\r\nhe went back to her again.  I could hardly sit still; I wanted to go in\r\nand give her a good shaking.\r\n\r\n\"Then it's all over,\" he was saying with a long breath.  \"The plans we\r\nmade together, the hopes, the--all of it--over!  Well, I'll not be a\r\nbaby, and I'll give you up the minute you say 'I don't love you and I\r\ndo love--some one else'!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can not say that,\" she breathed, \"but, very soon, I shall marry--the\r\nother man.\"\r\n\r\nI could hear Halsey's low triumphant laugh.\r\n\r\n\"I defy him,\" he said.  \"Sweetheart, as long as you care for me, I am\r\nnot afraid.\"\r\n\r\nThe wind slammed the door between the two rooms just then, and I could\r\nhear nothing more, although I moved my chair quite close. After a\r\ndiscreet interval, I went into the other room, and found Louise alone.\r\nShe was staring with sad eyes at the cherub painted on the ceiling over\r\nthe bed, and because she looked tired I did not disturb her.\r\n\nWe had discovered Louise at the lodge Tuesday night.  It was Wednesday\r\nI had my interview with her.  Thursday and Friday were uneventful, save\r\nas they marked improvement in our patient. Gertrude spent almost all\r\nthe time with her, and the two had grown to be great friends.  But\r\ncertain things hung over me constantly; the coroner's inquest on the\r\ndeath of Arnold Armstrong, to be held Saturday, and the arrival of Mrs.\r\nArmstrong and young Doctor Walker, bringing the body of the dead\r\npresident of the Traders' Bank.  We had not told Louise of either death.\r\n\r\nThen, too, I was anxious about the children.  With their mother's\r\ninheritance swept away in the wreck of the bank, and with their love\r\naffairs in a disastrous condition, things could scarcely be worse.\r\nAdded to that, the cook and Liddy had a flare-up over the proper way to\r\nmake beef-tea for Louise, and, of course, the cook left.\r\n\r\nMrs. Watson had been glad enough, I think, to turn Louise over to our\r\ncare, and Thomas went upstairs night and morning to greet his young\r\nmistress from the doorway.  Poor Thomas!  He had the faculty--found\r\nstill in some old negroes, who cling to the traditions of slavery\r\ndays--of making his employer's interest his.  It was always \"we\" with\r\nThomas; I miss him sorely; pipe-smoking, obsequious, not over reliable,\r\nkindly old man!\r\n\r\nOn Thursday Mr. Harton, the Armstrongs' legal adviser, called up from\r\ntown.  He had been advised, he said, that Mrs. Armstrong was coming\r\neast with her husband's body and would arrive Monday.  He came with\r\nsome hesitation, he went on, to the fact that he had been further\r\ninstructed to ask me to relinquish my lease on Sunnyside, as it was\r\nMrs. Armstrong's desire to come directly there.\r\n\r\nI was aghast.\r\n\r\n\"Here!\" I said.  \"Surely you are mistaken, Mr. Harton.  I should think,\r\nafter--what happened here only a few days ago, she would never wish to\r\ncome back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" he replied, \"she is most anxious to come.  This is what\r\nshe says.  'Use every possible means to have Sunnyside vacated.  Must\r\ngo there at once.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Harton,\" I said testily, \"I am not going to do anything of the\r\nkind.  I and mine have suffered enough at the hands of this family.  I\r\nrented the house at an exorbitant figure and I have moved out here for\r\nthe summer.  My city home is dismantled and in the hands of decorators.\r\nI have been here one week, during which I have had not a single night\r\nof uninterrupted sleep, and I intend to stay until I have recuperated.\r\nMoreover, if Mr. Armstrong died insolvent, as I believe was the case,\r\nhis widow ought to be glad to be rid of so expensive a piece of\r\nproperty.\"\r\n\r\nThe lawyer cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n\"I am very sorry you have made this decision,\" he said.  \"Miss Innes,\r\nMrs. Fitzhugh tells me Louise Armstrong is with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has she been informed of this--double bereavement?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" I said.  \"She has been very ill; perhaps to-night she can be\r\ntold.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very sad; very sad,\" he said.  \"I have a telegram for her, Mrs.\r\nInnes.  Shall I send it out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Better open it and read it to me,\" I suggested.  \"If it is important,\r\nthat will save time.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause while Mr. Harton opened the telegram.  Then he read\r\nit slowly, judicially.\r\n\r\n\"'Watch for Nina Carrington.  Home Monday.  Signed F. L. W.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum!\" I said.  \"'Watch for Nina Carrington.  Home Monday.'  Very well,\r\nMr. Harton, I will tell her, but she is not in condition to watch for\r\nany one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Miss Innes, if you decide to--er--relinquish the lease, let me\r\nknow,\" the lawyer said.\r\n\r\n\"I shall not relinquish it,\" I replied, and I imagined his irritation\r\nfrom the way he hung up the receiver.\r\n\r\nI wrote the telegram down word for word, afraid to trust my memory, and\r\ndecided to ask Doctor Stewart how soon Louise might be told the truth.\r\nThe closing of the Traders' Bank I considered unnecessary for her to\r\nknow, but the death of her stepfather and stepbrother must be broken to\r\nher soon, or she might hear it in some unexpected and shocking manner.\r\n\r\nDoctor Stewart came about four o'clock, bringing his leather satchel\r\ninto the house with a great deal of care, and opening it at the foot of\r\nthe stairs to show me a dozen big yellow eggs nesting among the bottles.\r\n\r\n\"Real eggs,\" he said proudly.  \"None of your anemic store eggs, but the\r\nreal thing--some of them still warm.  Feel them!  Egg-nog for Miss\r\nLouise.\"\r\n\r\nHe was beaming with satisfaction, and before he left, he insisted on\r\ngoing back to the pantry and making an egg-nog with his own hands.\r\nSomehow, all the time he was doing it, I had a vision of Doctor\r\nWilloughby, my nerve specialist in the city, trying to make an egg-nog.\r\nI wondered if he ever prescribed anything so plebeian--and so\r\ndelicious.  And while Doctor Stewart whisked the eggs he talked.\r\n\r\n\"I said to Mrs. Stewart,\" he confided, a little red in the face from\r\nthe exertion, \"after I went home the other day, that you would think me\r\nan old gossip, for saying what I did about Walker and Miss Louise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of the sort,\" I protested.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is,\" he went on, evidently justifying him self, \"I got that\r\npiece of information just as we get a lot of things, through the\r\nkitchen end of the house.  Young Walker's chauffeur--Walker's more\r\nfashionable than I am, and he goes around the country in a Stanhope\r\ncar--well, his chauffeur comes to see our servant girl, and he told her\r\nthe whole thing.  I thought it was probable, because Walker spent a lot\r\nof time up here last summer, when the family was here, and besides,\r\nRiggs, that's Walker's man, had a very pat little story about the\r\ndoctor's building a house on this property, just at the foot of the\r\nhill.  The sugar, please.\"\r\n\r\nThe egg-nog was finished.  Drop by drop the liquor had cooked the egg,\r\nand now, with a final whisk, a last toss in the shaker, it was ready, a\r\nsymphony in gold and white.  The doctor sniffed it.\r\n\r\n\"Real eggs, real milk, and a touch of real Kentucky whisky,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHe insisted on carrying it up himself, but at the foot of the stairs he\r\npaused.\r\n\r\n\"Riggs said the plans were drawn for the house,\" he said, harking back\r\nto the old subject.  \"Drawn by Huston in town.  So I naturally believed\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the doctor came down, I was ready with a question.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" I asked, \"is there any one in the neighborhood named\r\nCarrington?  Nina Carrington?\"\r\n\r\n\"Carrington?\"  He wrinkled his forehead.  \"Carrington?  No, I don't\r\nremember any such family.  There used to be Covingtons down the creek.\"\r\n\r\n\"The name was Carrington,\" I said, and the subject lapsed.\r\n\r\nGertrude and Halsey went for a long walk that afternoon, and Louise\r\nslept.  Time hung heavy on my hands, and I did as I had fallen into a\r\nhabit of doing lately--I sat down and thought things over.  One result\r\nof my meditations was that I got up suddenly and went to the telephone.\r\nI had taken the most intense dislike to this Doctor Walker, whom I had\r\nnever seen, and who was being talked of in the countryside as the\r\nfiance of Louise Armstrong.\r\n\r\nI knew Sam Huston well.  There had been a time, when Sam was a good\r\ndeal younger than he is now, before he had married Anne Endicott, when\r\nI knew him even better.  So now I felt no hesitation in calling him\r\nover the telephone.  But when his office boy had given way to his\r\nconfidential clerk, and that functionary had condescended to connect\r\nhis employer's desk telephone, I was somewhat at a loss as to how to\r\nbegin.\r\n\r\n\"Why, how are you, Rachel?\" Sam said sonorously.  \"Going to build that\r\nhouse at Rock View?\"  It was a twenty-year-old joke of his.\r\n\r\n\"Sometime, perhaps,\" I said.  \"Just now I want to ask you a question\r\nabout something which is none of my business.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see you haven't changed an iota in a quarter of a century, Rachel.\"\r\nThis was intended to be another jest.  \"Ask ahead: everything but my\r\ndomestic affairs is at your service.\"\r\n\r\n\"Try to be serious,\" I said.  \"And tell me this: has your firm made any\r\nplans for a house recently, for a Doctor Walker, at Casanova?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where was it to be built?  I have a reason for asking.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was to be, I believe, on the Armstrong place.  Mr. Armstrong\r\nhimself consulted me, and the inference was--in fact, I am quite\r\ncertain--the house was to be occupied by Mr. Armstrong's daughter, who\r\nwas engaged to marry Doctor Walker.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the architect had inquired for the different members of my family,\r\nand had finally rung off, I was certain of one thing. Louise Armstrong\r\nwas in love with Halsey, and the man she was going to marry was Doctor\r\nWalker.  Moreover, this decision was not new; marriage had been\r\ncontemplated for some time. There must certainly be some\r\nexplanation--but what was it?\r\n\r\nThat day I repeated to Louise the telegram Mr. Warton had opened.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to understand, but an unhappier face I have never seen.  She\r\nlooked like a criminal whose reprieve is over, and the day of execution\r\napproaching.\r\n\nThe next day, Friday, Gertrude broke the news of her stepfather's death\r\nto Louise.  She did it as gently as she could, telling her first that\r\nhe was very ill, and finally that he was dead.  Louise received the\r\nnews in the most unexpected manner, and when Gertrude came out to tell\r\nme how she had stood it, I think she was almost shocked.\r\n\r\n\"She just lay and stared at me, Aunt Ray,\" she said.  \"Do you know, I\r\nbelieve she is glad, glad!  And she is too honest to pretend anything\r\nelse.  What sort of man was Mr. Paul Armstrong, anyhow?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a bully as well as a rascal, Gertrude,\" I said.  \"But I am\r\nconvinced of one thing; Louise will send for Halsey now, and they will\r\nmake it all up.\"\r\n\r\nFor Louise had steadily refused to see Halsey all that day, and the boy\r\nwas frantic.\r\n\r\nWe had a quiet hour, Halsey and I, that evening, and I told him several\r\nthings; about the request that we give up the lease to Sunnyside, about\r\nthe telegram to Louise, about the rumors of an approaching marriage\r\nbetween the girl and Doctor Walker, and, last of all, my own interview\r\nwith her the day before.\r\n\r\nHe sat back in a big chair, with his face in the shadow, and my heart\r\nfairly ached for him.  He was so big and so boyish!  When I had\r\nfinished he drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever Louise does,\" he said, \"nothing will convince me, Aunt Ray,\r\nthat she doesn't care for me.  And up to two months ago, when she and\r\nher mother went west, I was the happiest fellow on earth.  Then\r\nsomething made a difference: she wrote me that her people were opposed\r\nto the marriage; that her feeling for me was what it had always been,\r\nbut that something had happened which had changed her ideas as to the\r\nfuture.  I was not to write until she wrote me, and whatever occurred,\r\nI was to think the best I could of her.  It sounded like a puzzle.\r\nWhen I saw her yesterday, it was the same thing, only, perhaps, worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Halsey,\" I asked, \"have you any idea of the nature of the interview\r\nbetween Louise Armstrong and Arnold the night he was murdered?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was stormy.  Thomas says once or twice he almost broke into the\r\nroom, he was so alarmed for Louise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another thing, Halsey,\" I said, \"have you ever heard Louise mention a\r\nwoman named Carrington, Nina Carrington?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" he said positively.\r\n\r\nFor try as we would, our thoughts always came back to that fatal\r\nSaturday night, and the murder.  Every conversational path led to it,\r\nand we all felt that Jamieson was tightening the threads of evidence\r\naround John Bailey.  The detective's absence was hardly reassuring; he\r\nmust have had something to work on in town, or he would have returned.\r\n\r\nThe papers reported that the cashier of the Traders' Bank was ill in\r\nhis apartments at the Knickerbocker--a condition not surprising,\r\nconsidering everything.  The guilt of the defunct president was no\r\nlonger in doubt; the missing bonds had been advertised and some of them\r\ndiscovered.  In every instance they had been used as collateral for\r\nlarge loans, and the belief was current that not less than a million\r\nand a half dollars had been realized.  Every one connected with the\r\nbank had been placed under arrest, and released on heavy bond.\r\n\r\nWas he alone in his guilt, or was the cashier his accomplice? Where was\r\nthe money?  The estate of the dead man was comparatively small--a city\r\nhouse on a fashionable street, Sunnyside, a large estate largely\r\nmortgaged, an insurance of fifty thousand dollars, and some personal\r\nproperty--this was all.\r\n\r\nThe rest lost in speculation probably, the papers said.  There was one\r\nthing which looked uncomfortable for Jack Bailey: he and Paul Armstrong\r\ntogether had promoted a railroad company in New Mexico, and it was\r\nrumored that together they had sunk large sums of money there.  The\r\nbusiness alliance between the two men added to the belief that Bailey\r\nknew something of the looting.  His unexplained absence from the bank\r\non Monday lent color to the suspicion against him.  The strange thing\r\nseemed to be his surrendering himself on the point of departure.  To\r\nme, it seemed the shrewd calculation of a clever rascal.  I was not\r\nactively antagonistic to Gertrude's lover, but I meant to be convinced,\r\none way or the other.  I took no one on faith.\r\n\r\nThat night the Sunnyside ghost began to walk again.  Liddy had been\r\nsleeping in Louise's dressing-room on a couch, and the approach of dusk\r\nwas a signal for her to barricade the entire suite.  Situated as its\r\nwas, beyond the circular staircase, nothing but an extremity of\r\nexcitement would have made her pass it after dark.  I confess myself\r\nthat the place seemed to me to have a sinister appearance, but we kept\r\nthat wing well lighted, and until the lights went out at midnight it\r\nwas really cheerful, if one did not know its history.\r\n\r\nOn Friday night, then, I had gone to bed, resolved to go at once to\r\nsleep.  Thoughts that insisted on obtruding themselves I pushed\r\nresolutely to the back of my mind, and I systematically relaxed every\r\nmuscle.  I fell asleep soon, and was dreaming that Doctor Walker was\r\nbuilding his new house immediately in front of my windows: I could hear\r\nthe thump-thump of the hammers, and then I waked to a knowledge that\r\nsomebody was pounding on my door.\r\n\r\nI was up at once, and with the sound of my footstep on the floor the\r\nlow knocking ceased, to be followed immediately by sibilant whispering\r\nthrough the keyhole.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Rachel! Miss Rachel!\" somebody was saying, over and over.\r\n\r\n\"Is that you, Liddy?\" I asked, my hand on the knob.\r\n\r\n\"For the love of mercy, let me in!\" she said in a low tone.\r\n\r\nShe was leaning against the door, for when I opened it, she fell in.\r\nShe was greenish-white, and she had a red and black barred flannel\r\npetticoat over her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" she said, standing in the middle of the floor and holding on\r\nto me.  \"Oh, Miss Rachel, it's the ghost of that dead man hammering to\r\nget in!\"\r\n\r\nSure enough, there was a dull thud--thud--thud from some place near.\r\nIt was muffled: one rather felt than heard it, and it was impossible to\r\nlocate.  One moment it seemed to come, three taps and a pause, from the\r\nfloor under us: the next, thud--thud--thud--it came apparently from the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\n\"It's not a ghost,\" I said decidedly.  \"If it was a ghost it wouldn't\r\nrap: it would come through the keyhole.\"  Liddy looked at the keyhole.\r\n\"But it sounds very much as though some one is trying to break into the\r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\nLiddy was shivering violently.  I told her to get me my slippers and\r\nshe brought me a pair of kid gloves, so I found my things myself, and\r\nprepared to call Halsey.  As before, the night alarm had found the\r\nelectric lights gone: the hall, save for its night lamp, was in\r\ndarkness, as I went across to Halsey's room.  I hardly know what I\r\nfeared, but it was a relief to find him there, very sound asleep, and\r\nwith his door unlocked.\r\n\r\n\"Wake up, Halsey,\" I said, shaking him.\r\n\r\nHe stirred a little.  Liddy was half in and half out of the door,\r\nafraid as usual to be left alone, and not quite daring to enter. Her\r\nscruples seemed to fade, however, all at once.  She gave a suppressed\r\nyell, bolted into the room, and stood tightly clutching the foot-board\r\nof the bed.  Halsey was gradually waking.\r\n\r\n\"I've seen it,\" Liddy wailed.  \"A woman in white down the hall!\"\r\n\r\nI paid no attention.\r\n\r\n\"Halsey,\" I persevered, \"some one is breaking into the house. Get up,\r\nwon't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't our house,\" he said sleepily.  And then he roused to the\r\nexigency of the occasion.  \"All right, Aunt Ray,\" he said, still\r\nyawning.  \"If you'll let me get into something--\"\r\n\r\nIt was all I could do to get Liddy out of the room.  The demands of the\r\noccasion had no influence on her: she had seen the ghost, she\r\npersisted, and she wasn't going into the hall.  But I got her over to\r\nmy room at last, more dead than alive, and made her lie down on the bed.\r\n\r\nThe tappings, which seemed to have ceased for a while, had commenced\r\nagain, but they were fainter.  Halsey came over in a few minutes, and\r\nstood listening and trying to locate the sound.\r\n\r\n\"Give me my revolver, Aunt Ray,\" he said; and I got it--the one I had\r\nfound in the tulip bed--and gave it to him.  He saw Liddy there and\r\ndivined at once that Louise was alone.\r\n\r\n\"You let me attend to this fellow, whoever it is, Aunt Ray, and go to\r\nLouise, will you?  She may be awake and alarmed.\"\r\n\r\nSo in spite of her protests, I left Liddy alone and went back to the\r\neast wing.  Perhaps I went a little faster past the yawning blackness\r\nof the circular staircase; and I could hear Halsey creaking cautiously\r\ndown the main staircase.  The rapping, or pounding, had ceased, and the\r\nsilence was almost painful. And then suddenly, from apparently under my\r\nvery feet, there rose a woman's scream, a cry of terror that broke off\r\nas suddenly as it came.  I stood frozen and still.  Every drop of blood\r\nin my body seemed to leave the surface and gather around my heart.  In\r\nthe dead silence that followed it throbbed as if it would burst. More\r\ndead than alive, I stumbled into Louise's bedroom.  She was not there!\r\n\nI stood looking at the empty bed.  The coverings had been thrown back,\r\nand Louise's pink silk dressing-gown was gone from the foot, where it\r\nhad lain.  The night lamp burned dimly, revealing the emptiness of the\r\nplace.  I picked it up, but my hand shook so that I put it down again,\r\nand got somehow to the door.\r\n\r\nThere were voices in the hall and Gertrude came running toward me.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" she cried.  \"What was that sound?  Where is Louise?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is not in her room,\" I said stupidly.  \"I think--it was she--who\r\nscreamed.\"\r\n\r\nLiddy had joined us now, carrying a light.  We stood huddled together\r\nat the head of the circular staircase, looking down into its shadows.\r\nThere was nothing to be seen, and it was absolutely quiet down there.\r\nThen we heard Halsey running up the main staircase.  He came quickly\r\ndown the hall to where we were standing.\r\n\r\n\"There's no one trying to get in.  I thought I heard some one shriek.\r\nWho was it?\"\r\n\r\nOur stricken faces told him the truth.\r\n\r\n\"Some one screamed down there,\" I said.  \"And--and Louise is not in her\r\nroom.\"\r\n\r\nWith a jerk Halsey took the light from Liddy and ran down the circular\r\nstaircase.  I followed him, more slowly.  My nerves seemed to be in a\r\nstate of paralysis:  I could scarcely step.  At the foot of the stairs\r\nHalsey gave an exclamation and put down the light.\r\n\r\n\"Aunt Ray,\" he called sharply.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the staircase, huddled in a heap, her head on the lower\r\nstair, was Louise Armstrong.  She lay limp and white, her dressing-gown\r\ndragging loose from one sleeve of her night-dress, and the heavy braid\r\nof her dark hair stretching its length a couple of steps above her\r\nhead, as if she had slipped down.\r\n\r\nShe was not dead: Halsey put her down on the floor, and began to rub\r\nher cold hands, while Gertrude and Liddy ran for stimulants. As for me,\r\nI sat there at the foot of that ghostly staircase--sat, because my\r\nknees wouldn't hold me--and wondered where it would all end.  Louise\r\nwas still unconscious, but she was breathing better, and I suggested\r\nthat we get her back to bed before she came to.  There was something\r\ngrisly and horrible to me, seeing her there in almost the same attitude\r\nand in the same place where we had found her brother's body.  And to\r\nadd to the similarity, just then the hall clock, far off, struck\r\nfaintly three o'clock.\r\n\r\nIt was four before Louise was able to talk, and the first rays of dawn\r\nwere coming through her windows, which faced the east, before she could\r\ntell us coherently what had occurred.  I give it as she told it.  She\r\nlay propped in bed, and Halsey sat beside her, unrebuffed, and held her\r\nhand while she talked.\r\n\r\n\"I was not sleeping well,\" she began, \"partly, I think, because I had\r\nslept during the afternoon.  Liddy brought me some hot milk at ten\r\no'clock and I slept until twelve.  Then I wakened and--I got to\r\nthinking about things, and worrying, so I could not go to sleep.\r\n\r\n\"I was wondering why I had not heard from Arnold since the--since I saw\r\nhim that night at the lodge.  I was afraid he was ill, because--he was\r\nto have done something for me, and he had not come back.  It must have\r\nbeen three when I heard some one rapping.  I sat up and listened, to be\r\nquite sure, and the rapping kept up.  It was cautious, and I was about\r\nto call Liddy.\r\n\r\n\"Then suddenly I thought I knew what it was.  The east entrance and the\r\ncircular staircase were always used by Arnold when he was out late, and\r\nsometimes, when he forgot his key, he would rap and I would go down and\r\nlet him in.  I thought he had come back to see me--I didn't think about\r\nthe time, for his hours were always erratic.  But I was afraid I was\r\ntoo weak to get down the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"The knocking kept up, and just as I was about to call Liddy, she ran\r\nthrough the room and out into the hall.  I got up then, feeling weak\r\nand dizzy, and put on my dressing-gown.  If it was Arnold, I knew I\r\nmust see him.\r\n\r\n\"It was very dark everywhere, but, of course, I knew my way.  I felt\r\nalong for the stair-rail, and went down as quickly as I could.  The\r\nknocking had stopped, and I was afraid I was too late.  I got to the\r\nfoot of the staircase and over to the door on to the east veranda.  I\r\nhad never thought of anything but that it was Arnold, until I reached\r\nthe door.  It was unlocked and opened about an inch.  Everything was\r\nblack: it was perfectly dark outside.  I felt very queer and shaky.\r\nThen I thought perhaps Arnold had used his key; he did--strange things\r\nsometimes, and I turned around.  Just as I reached the foot of the\r\nstaircase I thought I heard some one coming.  My nerves were going\r\nanyhow, there in the dark, and I could scarcely stand.  I got up as far\r\nas the third or fourth step; then I felt that some one was coming\r\ntoward me on the staircase.  The next instant a hand met mine on the\r\nstair-rail.  Some one brushed past me, and I screamed.  Then I must\r\nhave fainted.\"\r\n\r\nThat was Louise's story.  There could be no doubt of its truth, and the\r\nthing that made it inexpressibly awful to me was that the poor girl had\r\ncrept down to answer the summons of a brother who would never need her\r\nkindly offices again.  Twice now, without apparent cause, some one had\r\nentered the house by means of the east entrance: had apparently gone\r\nhis way unhindered through the house, and gone out again as he had\r\nentered.  Had this unknown visitor been there a third time, the night\r\nArnold Armstrong was murdered?  Or a fourth, the time Mr. Jamieson had\r\nlocked some one in the clothes chute?\r\n\r\nSleep was impossible, I think, for any of us.  We dispersed finally to\r\nbathe and dress, leaving Louise little the worse for her experience.\r\nBut I determined that before the day was over she must know the true\r\nstate of affairs.  Another decision I made, and I put it into execution\r\nimmediately after breakfast.  I had one of the unused bedrooms in the\r\neast wing, back along the small corridor, prepared for occupancy, and\r\nfrom that time on, Alex, the gardener, slept there.  One man in that\r\nbarn of a house was an absurdity, with things happening all the time,\r\nand I must say that Alex was as unobjectionable as any one could\r\npossibly have been.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, also, Halsey and I made an exhaustive examination of\r\nthe circular staircase, the small entry at its foot, and the card-room\r\nopening from it.  There was no evidence of anything unusual the night\r\nbefore, and had we not ourselves heard the rapping noises, I should\r\nhave felt that Louise's imagination had run away with her.  The outer\r\ndoor was closed and locked, and the staircase curved above us, for all\r\nthe world like any other staircase.\r\n\r\nHalsey, who had never taken seriously my account of the night Liddy and\r\nI were there alone, was grave enough now.  He examined the paneling of\r\nthe wainscoting above and below the stairs, evidently looking for a\r\nsecret door, and suddenly there flashed into my mind the recollection\r\nof a scrap of paper that Mr. Jamieson had found among Arnold\r\nArmstrong's effects.  As nearly as possible I repeated its contents to\r\nhim, while Halsey took them down in a note-book.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you had told me that before,\" he said, as he put the memorandum\r\ncarefully away.  We found nothing at all in the house, and I expected\r\nlittle from any examination of the porch and grounds.  But as we opened\r\nthe outer door something fell into the entry with a clatter.  It was a\r\ncue from the billiard-room.\r\n\r\nHalsey picked it up with an exclamation.\r\n\r\n\"That's careless enough,\" he said.  \"Some of the servants have been\r\namusing themselves.\"\r\n\r\nI was far from convinced.  Not one of the servants would go into that\r\nwing at night unless driven by dire necessity.  And a billiard cue!  As\r\na weapon of either offense or defense it was an absurdity, unless one\r\naccepted Liddy's hypothesis of a ghost, and even then, as Halsey\r\npointed out, a billiard-playing ghost would be a very modern evolution\r\nof an ancient institution.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon we, Gertrude, Halsey and I, attended the coroner's\r\ninquest in town.  Doctor Stewart had been summoned also, it transpiring\r\nthat in that early Sunday morning, when Gertrude and I had gone to our\r\nrooms, he had been called to view the body.  We went, the four of us,\r\nin the machine, preferring the execrable roads to the matinee train,\r\nwith half of Casanova staring at us. And on the way we decided to say\r\nnothing of Louise and her interview with her stepbrother the night he\r\ndied.  The girl was in trouble enough as it was.\r\n\nIn giving the gist of what happened at the inquest, I have only one\r\nexcuse--to recall to the reader the events of the night of Arnold\r\nArmstrong's murder.  Many things had occurred which were not brought\r\nout at the inquest and some things were told there that were new to me.\r\nAltogether, it was a gloomy affair, and the six men in the corner, who\r\nconstituted the coroner's jury, were evidently the merest puppets in\r\nthe hands of that all-powerful gentleman, the coroner.\r\n\r\nGertrude and I sat well back, with our veils down.  There were a number\r\nof people I knew: Barbara Fitzhugh, in extravagant mourning--she always\r\nwent into black on the slightest provocation, because it was\r\nbecoming--and Mr. Jarvis, the man who had come over from the Greenwood\r\nClub the night of the murder.  Mr. Harton was there, too, looking\r\nimpatient as the inquest dragged, but alive to every particle of\r\nevidence. From a corner Mr. Jamieson was watching the proceedings\r\nintently.\r\n\r\nDoctor Stewart was called first.  His evidence was told briefly, and\r\namounted to this: on the Sunday morning previous, at a quarter before\r\nfive, he had been called to the telephone.  The message was from a Mr.\r\nJarvis, who asked him to come at once to Sunnyside, as there had been\r\nan accident there, and Mr. Arnold Armstrong had been shot.  He had\r\ndressed hastily, gathered up some instruments, and driven to Sunnyside.\r\n\r\nHe was met by Mr. Jarvis, who took him at once to the east wing. There,\r\njust as he had fallen, was the body of Arnold Armstrong. There was no\r\nneed of the instruments: the man was dead.  In answer to the coroner's\r\nquestion--no, the body had not been moved, save to turn it over.  It\r\nlay at the foot of the circular staircase.  Yes, he believed death had\r\nbeen instantaneous.  The body was still somewhat warm and rigor mortis\r\nhad not set in. It occurred late in cases of sudden death.  No, he\r\nbelieved the probability of suicide might be eliminated; the wounds\r\ncould have been self-inflicted, but with difficulty, and there had been\r\nno weapon found.\r\n\r\nThe doctor's examination was over, but he hesitated and cleared his\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Coroner,\" he said, \"at the risk of taking up valuable time, I\r\nwould like to speak of an incident that may or may not throw some light\r\non this matter.\"\r\n\r\nThe audience was alert at once.\r\n\r\n\"Kindly proceed, Doctor,\" the coroner said.\r\n\r\n\"My home is in Englewood, two miles from Casanova,\" the doctor began.\r\n\"In the absence of Doctor Walker, a number of Casanova people have been\r\nconsulting me.  A month ago--five weeks, to be exact--a woman whom I\r\nhad never seen came to my office.  She was in deep mourning and kept\r\nher veil down, and she brought for examination a child, a boy of six.\r\nThe little fellow was ill; it looked like typhoid, and the mother was\r\nfrantic.  She wanted a permit to admit the youngster to the Children's\r\nHospital in town here, where I am a member of the staff, and I gave her\r\none.  The incident would have escaped me, but for a curious thing.  Two\r\ndays before Mr. Armstrong was shot, I was sent for to go to the Country\r\nClub: some one had been struck with a golf-ball that had gone wild.  It\r\nwas late when I left--I was on foot, and about a mile from the club, on\r\nthe Claysburg road, I met two people.  They were disputing violently,\r\nand I had no difficulty in recognizing Mr. Armstrong.  The woman,\r\nbeyond doubt, was the one who had consulted me about the child.\"\r\n\r\nAt this hint of scandal, Mrs. Ogden Fitzhugh sat up very straight.\r\nJamieson was looking slightly skeptical, and the coroner made a note.\r\n\r\n\"The Children's Hospital, you say, Doctor?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  But the child, who was entered as Lucien Wallace, was taken away\r\nby his mother two weeks ago.  I have tried to trace them and failed.\"\r\n\r\nAll at once I remembered the telegram sent to Louise by some one signed\r\nF. L. W.--presumably Doctor Walker.  Could this veiled woman be the\r\nNina Carrington of the message?  But it was only idle speculation.  I\r\nhad no way of finding out, and the inquest was proceeding.\r\n\r\nThe report of the coroner's physician came next.  The post-mortem\r\nexamination showed that the bullet had entered the chest in the fourth\r\nleft intercostal space and had taken an oblique course downward and\r\nbackward, piercing both the heart and lungs. The left lung was\r\ncollapsed, and the exit point of the ball had been found in the muscles\r\nof the back to the left of the spinal column.  It was improbable that\r\nsuch a wound had been self-inflicted, and its oblique downward course\r\npointed to the fact that the shot had been fired from above.  In other\r\nwords, as the murdered man had been found dead at the foot of a\r\nstaircase, it was probable that the shot had been fired by some one\r\nhigher up on the stairs.  There were no marks of powder.  The bullet, a\r\nthirty-eight caliber, had been found in the dead man's clothing, and\r\nwas shown to the jury.\r\n\r\nMr. Jarvis was called next, but his testimony amounted to little.\r\n\r\nHe had been summoned by telephone to Sunnyside, had come over at once\r\nwith the steward and Mr. Winthrop, at present out of town. They had\r\nbeen admitted by the housekeeper, and had found the body lying at the\r\nfoot of the staircase.  He had made a search for a weapon, but there\r\nwas none around.  The outer entry door in the east wing had been\r\nunfastened and was open about an inch.\r\n\r\nI had been growing more and more nervous.  When the coroner called Mr.\r\nJohn Bailey, the room was filled with suppressed excitement.  Mr.\r\nJamieson went forward and spoke a few words to the coroner, who nodded.\r\nThen Halsey was called.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Innes,\" the coroner said, \"will you tell under what circumstances\r\nyou saw Mr. Arnold Armstrong the night he died?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw him first at the Country Club,\" Halsey said quietly.  He was\r\nrather pale, but very composed.  \"I stopped there with my automobile\r\nfor gasolene.  Mr. Armstrong had been playing cards. When I saw him\r\nthere, he was coming out of the card-room, talking to Mr. John Bailey.\"\r\n\r\n\"The nature of the discussion--was it amicable?\"\r\n\r\nHalsey hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"They were having a dispute,\" he said.  \"I asked Mr. Bailey to leave\r\nthe club with me and come to Sunnyside over Sunday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it a fact, Mr. Innes, that you took Mr. Bailey away from the\r\nclub-house because you were afraid there would be blows?\"\r\n\r\n\"The situation was unpleasant,\" Halsey said evasively.\r\n\r\n\"At that time had you any suspicion that the Traders' Bank had been\r\nwrecked?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"What occurred next?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bailey and I talked in the billiard-room until two-thirty.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Mr. Arnold Armstrong came there, while you were talking?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  He came about half-past two.  He rapped at the east door, and I\r\nadmitted him.\"\r\n\r\nThe silence in the room was intense.  Mr. Jamieson's eyes never left\r\nHalsey's face.\r\n\r\n\"Will you tell us the nature of his errand?\"\r\n\r\n\"He brought a telegram that had come to the club for Mr. Bailey.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was sober?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly, at that time.  Not earlier.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was not his apparent friendliness a change from his former attitude?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  I did not understand it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long did he stay?\"\r\n\r\n\"About five minutes.  Then he left, by the east entrance.\"\r\n\r\n\"What occurred then?\"\r\n\r\n\"We talked for a few minutes, discussing a plan Mr. Bailey had in mind.\r\nThen I went to the stables, where I kept my car, and got it out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leaving Mr. Bailey alone in the billiard-room?\"\r\n\r\nHalsey hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"My sister was there?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Ogden Fitzhugh had the courage to turn and eye Gertrude through\r\nher lorgnon.\r\n\r\n\"And then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I took the car along the lower road, not to disturb the household.\r\nMr. Bailey came down across the lawn, through the hedge, and got into\r\nthe car on the road.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you know nothing of Mr. Armstrong's movements after he left the\r\nhouse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.  I read of his death Monday evening for the first time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bailey did not see him on his way across the lawn?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not.  If he had seen him he would have spoken of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you.  That is all.  Miss Gertrude Innes.\"\r\n\r\nGertrude's replies were fully as concise as Halsey's.  Mrs. Fitzhugh\r\nsubjected her to a close inspection, commencing with her hat and ending\r\nwith her shoes.  I flatter myself she found nothing wrong with either\r\nher gown or her manner, but poor Gertrude's testimony was the reverse\r\nof comforting.  She had been summoned, she said, by her brother, after\r\nMr. Armstrong had gone.\r\n\r\nShe had waited in the billiard-room with Mr. Bailey, until the\r\nautomobile had been ready.  Then she had locked the door at the foot of\r\nthe staircase, and, taking a lamp, had accompanied Mr. Bailey to the\r\nmain entrance of the house, and had watched him cross the lawn.\r\nInstead of going at once to her room, she had gone back to the\r\nbilliard-room for something which had been left there.  The card-room\r\nand billiard-room were in darkness.  She had groped around, found the\r\narticle she was looking for, and was on the point of returning to her\r\nroom, when she had heard some one fumbling at the lock at the east\r\nouter door.  She had thought it was probably her brother, and had been\r\nabout to go to the door, when she heard it open.  Almost immediately\r\nthere was a shot, and she had run panic-stricken through the\r\ndrawing-room and had roused the house.\r\n\r\n\"You heard no other sound?\" the coroner asked.  \"There was no one with\r\nMr. Armstrong when he entered?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was perfectly dark.  There were no voices and I heard nothing.\r\nThere was just the opening of the door, the shot, and the sound of\r\nsomebody falling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, while you went through the drawing-room and up-stairs to alarm\r\nthe household, the criminal, whoever it was, could have escaped by the\r\neast door?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you.  That will do.\"\r\n\r\nI flatter myself that the coroner got little enough out of me.  I saw\r\nMr. Jamieson smiling to himself, and the coroner gave me up, after a\r\ntime.  I admitted I had found the body, said I had not known who it was\r\nuntil Mr. Jarvis told me, and ended by looking up at Barbara Fitzhugh\r\nand saying that in renting the house I had not expected to be involved\r\nin any family scandal.  At which she turned purple.\r\n\r\nThe verdict was that Arnold Armstrong had met his death at the hands of\r\na person or persons unknown, and we all prepared to leave.  Barbara\r\nFitzhugh flounced out without waiting to speak to me, but Mr. Harton\r\ncame up, as I knew he would.\r\n\r\n\"You have decided to give up the house, I hope, Miss Innes,\" he said.\r\n\"Mrs. Armstrong has wired me again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not going to give it up,\" I maintained, \"until I understand some\r\nthings that are puzzling me.  The day that the murderer is discovered,\r\nI will leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, judging by what I have heard, you will be back in the city very\r\nsoon,\" he said.  And I knew that he suspected the discredited cashier\r\nof the Traders' Bank.\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson came up to me as I was about to leave the coroner's office.\r\n\r\n\"How is your patient?\" he asked with his odd little smile.\r\n\r\n\"I have no patient,\" I replied, startled.\r\n\r\n\"I will put it in a different way, then.  How is Miss Armstrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"She--she is doing very well,\" I stammered.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" cheerfully.  \"And our ghost?  Is it laid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Jamieson,\" I said suddenly, \"I wish you would do one thing: I wish\r\nyou would come to Sunnyside and spend a few days there. The ghost is\r\nnot laid.  I want you to spend one night at least watching the circular\r\nstaircase.  The murder of Arnold Armstrong was a beginning, not an end.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked serious.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I can do it,\" he said.  \"I have been doing something else,\r\nbut--well, I will come out to-night.\"\r\n\r\nWe were very silent during the trip back to Sunnyside.  I watched\r\nGertrude closely and somewhat sadly.  To me there was one glaring flaw\r\nin her story, and it seemed to stand out for every one to see.  Arnold\r\nArmstrong had had no key, and yet she said she had locked the east\r\ndoor.  He must have been admitted from within the house; over and over\r\nI repeated it to myself.\r\n\r\nThat night, as gently as I could, I told Louise the story of her\r\nstepbrother's death.  She sat in her big, pillow-filled chair, and\r\nheard me through without interruption.  It was clear that she was\r\nshocked beyond words: if I had hoped to learn anything from her\r\nexpression, I had failed.  She was as much in the dark as we were.\r\n\nMy taking the detective out to Sunnyside raised an unexpected storm of\r\nprotest from Gertrude and Halsey.  I was not prepared for it, and I\r\nscarcely knew how to account for it.  To me Mr. Jamieson was far less\r\nformidable under my eyes where I knew what he was doing, than he was of\r\nin the city, twisting circumstances and motives to suit himself and\r\nlearning what he wished to know, about events at Sunnyside, in some\r\noccult way.  I was glad enough to have him there, when excitements\r\nbegan to come thick and fast.\r\n\r\nA new element was about to enter into affairs: Monday, or Tuesday at\r\nthe latest, would find Doctor Walker back in his green and white house\r\nin the village, and Louise's attitude to him in the immediate future\r\nwould signify Halsey's happiness or wretchedness, as it might turn out.\r\nThen, too, the return of her mother would mean, of course, that she\r\nwould have to leave us, and I had become greatly attached to her.\r\n\r\nFrom the day Mr. Jamieson came to Sunnyside there was a subtle change\r\nin Gertrude's manner to me.  It was elusive, difficult to analyze, but\r\nit was there.  She was no longer frank with me, although I think her\r\naffection never wavered.  At the time I laid the change to the fact\r\nthat I had forbidden all communication with John Bailey, and had\r\nrefused to acknowledge any engagement between the two.  Gertrude spent\r\nmuch of her time wandering through the grounds, or taking long\r\ncross-country walks.  Halsey played golf at the Country Club day after\r\nday, and after Louise left, as she did the following week, Mr. Jamieson\r\nand I were much together.  He played a fair game of cribbage, but he\r\ncheated at solitaire.\r\n\r\nThe night the detective arrived, Saturday, I had a talk with him.\r\n\r\nI told him of the experience Louise Armstrong had had the night before,\r\non the circular staircase, and about the man who had so frightened\r\nRosie on the drive.  I saw that he thought the information was\r\nimportant, and to my suggestion that we put an additional lock on the\r\neast wing door he opposed a strong negative.\r\n\r\n\"I think it probable,\" he said, \"that our visitor will be back again,\r\nand the thing to do is to leave things exactly as they are, to avoid\r\nrousing suspicion.  Then I can watch for at least a part of each night\r\nand probably Mr. Innes will help us out.  I would say as little to\r\nThomas as possible.  The old man knows more than he is willing to\r\nadmit.\"\r\n\r\nI suggested that Alex, the gardener, would probably be willing to help,\r\nand Mr. Jamieson undertook to make the arrangement.  For one night,\r\nhowever, Mr. Jamieson preferred to watch alone. Apparently nothing\r\noccurred.  The detective sat in absolute darkness on the lower step of\r\nthe stairs, dozing, he said afterwards, now and then.  Nothing could\r\npass him in either direction, and the door in the morning remained as\r\nsecurely fastened as it had been the night before.  And yet one of the\r\nmost inexplicable occurrences of the whole affair took place that very\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nLiddy came to my room on Sunday morning with a face as long as the\r\nmoral law.  She laid out my things as usual, but I missed her customary\r\ngarrulousness.  I was not regaled with the new cook's extravagance as\r\nto eggs, and she even forbore to mention \"that Jamieson,\" on whose\r\narrival she had looked with silent disfavor.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Liddy?\" I asked at last.  \"Didn't you sleep last\r\nnight?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, ma'm,\" she said stiffly.\r\n\r\n\"Did you have two cups of coffee at your dinner?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"No, ma'm,\" indignantly.\r\n\r\nI sat up and almost upset my hot water--I always take a cup of hot\r\nwater with a pinch of salt, before I get up.  It tones the stomach.\r\n\r\n\"Liddy Allen,\" I said, \"stop combing that switch and tell me what is\r\nwrong with you.\"\r\n\r\nLiddy heaved a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Girl and woman,\" she said, \"I've been with you twenty-five years, Miss\r\nRachel, through good temper and bad--\" the idea! and what I have taken\r\nfrom her in the way of sulks!--\"but I guess I can't stand it any\r\nlonger.  My trunk's packed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who packed it?\" I asked, expecting from her tone to be told she had\r\nwakened to find it done by some ghostly hand.\r\n\r\n\"I did; Miss Rachel, you won't believe me when I tell you this house is\r\nhaunted.  Who was it fell down the clothes chute? Who was it scared\r\nMiss Louise almost into her grave?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm doing my best to find out,\" I said.  \"What in the world are you\r\ndriving at?\"  She drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n\"There is a hole in the trunk-room wall, dug out since last night.\r\nIt's big enough to put your head in, and the plaster's all over the\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" I said.  \"Plaster is always falling.\"\r\n\r\nBut Liddy clenched that.\r\n\r\n\"Just ask Alex,\" she said.  \"When he put the new cook's trunk there\r\nlast night the wall was as smooth as this.  This morning it's dug out,\r\nand there's plaster on the cook's trunk.  Miss Rachel, you can get a\r\ndozen detectives and put one on every stair in the house, and you'll\r\nnever catch anything.  There's some things you can't handcuff.\"\r\n\r\nLiddy was right.  As soon as I could, I went up to the trunk-room,\r\nwhich was directly over my bedroom.  The plan of the upper story of the\r\nhouse was like that of the second floor, in the main.  One end,\r\nhowever, over the east wing, had been left only roughly finished, the\r\nintention having been to convert it into a ball-room at some future\r\ntime.  The maids' rooms, trunk-room, and various store-rooms, including\r\na large airy linen-room, opened from a long corridor, like that on the\r\nsecond floor.  And in the trunk-room, as Liddy had said, was a fresh\r\nbreak in the plaster.\r\n\r\nNot only in the plaster, but through the lathing, the aperture\r\nextended.  I reached into the opening, and three feet away, perhaps, I\r\ncould touch the bricks of the partition wall.  For some reason, the\r\narchitect, in building the house, had left a space there that struck\r\nme, even in the surprise of the discovery, as an excellent place for a\r\nconflagration to gain headway.\r\n\r\n\"You are sure the hole was not here yesterday?\" I asked Liddy, whose\r\nexpression was a mixture of satisfaction and alarm.  In answer she\r\npointed to the new cook's trunk--that necessary adjunct of the\r\nmigratory domestic.  The top was covered with fine white plaster, as\r\nwas the floor.  But there were no large pieces of mortar lying\r\naround--no bits of lathing.  When I mentioned this to Liddy she merely\r\nraised her eyebrows.  Being quite confident that the gap was of unholy\r\norigin, she did not concern herself with such trifles as a bit of\r\nmortar and lath.  No doubt they were even then heaped neatly on a\r\ngravestone in the Casanova churchyard!\r\n\r\nI brought Mr. Jamieson up to see the hole in the wall, directly after\r\nbreakfast.  His expression was very odd when he looked at it, and the\r\nfirst thing he did was to try to discover what object, if any, such a\r\nhole could have.  He got a piece of candle, and by enlarging the\r\naperture a little was able to examine what lay beyond.  The result was\r\nnil.  The trunk-room, although heated by steam heat, like the rest of\r\nthe house, boasted of a fireplace and mantel as well.  The opening had\r\nbeen made between the flue and the outer wall of the house.  There was\r\nrevealed, however, on inspection, only the brick of the chimney on one\r\nside and the outer wall of the house on the other; in depth the space\r\nextended only to the flooring.  The breach had been made about four\r\nfeet from the floor, and inside were all the missing bits of plaster.\r\nIt had been a methodical ghost.\r\n\r\nIt was very much of a disappointment.  I had expected a secret room, at\r\nthe very least, and I think even Mr. Jamieson had fancied he might at\r\nlast have a clue to the mystery.  There was evidently nothing more to\r\nbe discovered: Liddy reported that everything was serene among the\r\nservants, and that none of them had been disturbed by the noise.  The\r\nmaddening thing, however, was that the nightly visitor had evidently\r\nmore than one way of gaining access to the house, and we made\r\narrangements to redouble our vigilance as to windows and doors that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nHalsey was inclined to pooh-pooh the whole affair.  He said a break in\r\nthe plaster might have occurred months ago and gone unnoticed, and that\r\nthe dust had probably been stirred up the day before.  After all, we\r\nhad to let it go at that, but we put in an uncomfortable Sunday.\r\nGertrude went to church, and Halsey took a long walk in the morning.\r\nLouise was able to sit up, and she allowed Halsey and Liddy to assist\r\nher down-stairs late in the afternoon.  The east veranda was shady,\r\ngreen with vines and palms, cheerful with cushions and lounging chairs.\r\nWe put Louise in a steamer chair, and she sat there passively enough,\r\nher hands clasped in her lap.\r\n\r\nWe were very silent.  Halsey sat on the rail with a pipe, openly\r\nwatching Louise, as she looked broodingly across the valley to the\r\nhills.  There was something baffling in the girl's eyes; and gradually\r\nHalsey's boyish features lost their glow at seeing her about again, and\r\nsettled into grim lines.  He was like his father just then.\r\n\r\nWe sat until late afternoon, Halsey growing more and more moody.\r\nShortly before six, he got up and went into the house, and in a few\r\nminutes he came out and called me to the telephone.  It was Anna\r\nWhitcomb, in town, and she kept me for twenty minutes, telling me the\r\nchildren had had the measles, and how Madame Sweeny had botched her new\r\ngown.\r\n\r\nWhen I finished, Liddy was behind me, her mouth a thin line.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would try to look cheerful, Liddy,\" I groaned, \"your face\r\nwould sour milk.\"  But Liddy seldom replied to my gibes. She folded her\r\nlips a little tighter.\r\n\r\n\"He called her up,\" she said oracularly, \"he called her up, and asked\r\nher to keep you at the telephone, so he could talk to Miss Louise. A\r\nTHANKLESS CHILD IS SHARPER THAN A SERPENT'S TOOTH.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" I said bruskly.  \"I might have known enough to leave them.\r\nIt's a long time since you and I were in love, Liddy, and--we forget.\"\r\n\r\nLiddy sniffed.\r\n\r\n\"No man ever made a fool of me,\" she replied virtuously.\r\n\r\n\"Well, something did,\" I retorted.\r\n\n\"Mr. Jamieson,\" I said, when we found ourselves alone after dinner that\r\nnight, \"the inquest yesterday seemed to me the merest recapitulation of\r\nthings that were already known.  It developed nothing new beyond the\r\nstory of Doctor Stewart's, and that was volunteered.\"\r\n\r\n\"An inquest is only a necessary formality, Miss Innes,\" he replied.\r\n\"Unless a crime is committed in the open, the inquest does nothing\r\nbeyond getting evidence from witnesses while events are still in their\r\nminds.  The police step in later.  You and I both know how many\r\nimportant things never transpired.  For instance: the dead man had no\r\nkey, and yet Miss Gertrude testified to a fumbling at the lock, and\r\nthen the opening of the door.  The piece of evidence you mention,\r\nDoctor Stewart's story, is one of those things we have to take\r\ncautiously: the doctor has a patient who wears black and does not raise\r\nher veil. Why, it is the typical mysterious lady!  Then the good doctor\r\ncomes across Arnold Armstrong, who was a graceless scamp--de\r\nmortuis--what's the rest of it?--and he is quarreling with a lady in\r\nblack.  Behold, says the doctor, they are one and the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why was Mr. Bailey not present at the inquest?\"\r\n\r\nThe detective's expression was peculiar.\r\n\r\n\"Because his physician testified that he is ill, and unable to leave\r\nhis bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ill!\" I exclaimed.  \"Why, neither Halsey nor Gertrude has told me\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are more things than that, Miss Innes, that are puzzling. Bailey\r\ngives the impression that he knew nothing of the crash at the bank\r\nuntil he read it in the paper Monday night, and that he went back and\r\nsurrendered himself immediately.  I do not believe it.  Jonas, the\r\nwatchman at the Traders' Bank, tells a different story.  He says that\r\non the Thursday night before, about eight-thirty, Bailey went back to\r\nthe bank.  Jonas admitted him, and he says the cashier was in a state\r\nalmost of collapse.  Bailey worked until midnight, then he closed the\r\nvault and went away. The occurrence was so unusual that the watchman\r\npondered over it an the rest of the night.  What did Bailey do when he\r\nwent back to the Knickerbocker apartments that night?  He packed a\r\nsuit-case ready for instant departure.  But he held off too long; he\r\nwaited for something.  My personal opinion is that he waited to see\r\nMiss Gertrude before flying from the country. Then, when he had shot\r\ndown Arnold Armstrong that night, he had to choose between two evils.\r\nHe did the thing that would immediately turn public opinion in his\r\nfavor, and surrendered himself, as an innocent man.  The strongest\r\nthing against him is his preparation for flight, and his deciding to\r\ncome back after the murder of Arnold Armstrong.  He was shrewd enough\r\nto disarm suspicion as to the graver charge?\"\r\n\r\nThe evening dragged along slowly.  Mrs. Watson came to my bedroom\r\nbefore I went to bed and asked if I had any arnica.  She showed me a\r\nbadly swollen hand, with reddish streaks running toward the elbow; she\r\nsaid it was the hand she had hurt the night of the murder a week\r\nbefore, and that she had not slept well since.  It looked to me as if\r\nit might be serious, and I told her to let Doctor Stewart see it.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Mrs. Watson went up to town on the eleven train, and\r\nwas admitted to the Charity Hospital.  She was suffering from\r\nblood-poisoning.  I fully meant to go up and see her there, but other\r\nthings drove her entirely from my mind.  I telephoned to the hospital\r\nthat day, however, and ordered a private room for her, and whatever\r\ncomforts she might be allowed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Armstrong arrived Monday evening with her husband's body, and the\r\nservices were set for the next day.  The house on Chestnut Street, in\r\ntown, had been opened, and Tuesday morning Louise left us to go home.\r\nShe sent for me before she went, and I saw she had been crying.\r\n\r\n\"How can I thank you, Miss Innes?\" she said.  \"You have taken me on\r\nfaith, and--you have not asked me any questions.  Some time, perhaps, I\r\ncan tell you; and when that time comes, you will all despise\r\nme,--Halsey, too.\"\r\n\r\nI tried to tell her how glad I was to have had her but there was\r\nsomething else she wanted to say.  She said it finally, when she had\r\nbade a constrained good-by to Halsey and the car was waiting at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Innes,\" she said in a low tone, \"if they--if there is any attempt\r\nmade to--to have you give up the house, do it, if you possibly can.  I\r\nam afraid--to have you stay.\"\r\n\r\nThat was all.  Gertrude went into town with her and saw her safely\r\nhome.  She reported a decided coolness in the greeting between Louise\r\nand her mother, and that Doctor Walker was there, apparently in charge\r\nof the arrangements for the funeral.  Halsey disappeared shortly after\r\nLouise left and came home about nine that night, muddy and tired.  As\r\nfor Thomas, he went around dejected and sad, and I saw the detective\r\nwatching him closely at dinner.  Even now I wonder--what did Thomas\r\nknow?  What did he suspect?\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock the household had settled down for the night. Liddy, who\r\nwas taking Mrs. Watson's place, had finished examining the tea-towels\r\nand the corners of the shelves in the cooling-room, and had gone to\r\nbed.  Alex, the gardener, had gone heavily up the circular staircase to\r\nhis room, and Mr. Jamieson was examining the locks of the windows.\r\nHalsey dropped into a chair in the living-room, and stared moodily\r\nahead.  Once he roused.\r\n\r\n\"What sort of a looking chap is that Walker, Gertrude?\" he asked!\r\n\r\n\"Rather tall, very dark, smooth-shaven.  Not bad looking,\" Gertrude\r\nsaid, putting down the book she had been pretending to read.  Halsey\r\nkicked a taboret viciously.\r\n\r\n\"Lovely place this village must be in the winter,\" he said\r\nirrelevantly.  \"A girl would be buried alive here.\"\r\n\r\nIt was then some one rapped at the knocker on the heavy front door.\r\nHalsey got up leisurely and opened it, admitting Warner. He was out of\r\nbreath from running, and he looked half abashed.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to disturb you,\" he said.  \"But I didn't know what else to\r\ndo.  It's about Thomas.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about Thomas?\" I asked.  Mr. Jamieson had come into the hall and\r\nwe all stared at Warner.\r\n\r\n\"He's acting queer,\" Warner explained.  \"He's sitting down there on the\r\nedge of the porch, and he says he has seen a ghost.  The old man looks\r\nbad, too; he can scarcely speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's as full of superstition as an egg is of meat,\" I said. \"Halsey,\r\nbring some whisky and we will all go down.\"\r\n\r\nNo one moved to get the whisky, from which I judged there were three\r\npocket flasks ready for emergency.  Gertrude threw a shawl around my\r\nshoulders, and we all started down over the hill: I had made so many\r\nnocturnal excursions around the place that I knew my way perfectly.\r\nBut Thomas was not on the veranda, nor was he inside the house.  The\r\nmen exchanged significant glances, and Warner got a lantern.\r\n\r\n\"He can't have gone far,\" he said.  \"He was trembling so that he\r\ncouldn't stand, when I left.\"\r\n\r\nJamieson and Halsey together made the round of the lodge, occasionally\r\ncalling the old man by name.  But there was no response.  No Thomas\r\ncame, bowing and showing his white teeth through the darkness.  I began\r\nto be vaguely uneasy, for the first time.  Gertrude, who was never\r\nnervous in the dark, went alone down the drive to the gate, and stood\r\nthere, looking along the yellowish line of the road, while I waited on\r\nthe tiny veranda.\r\n\r\nWarner was puzzled.  He came around to the edge of the veranda and\r\nstood looking at it as if it ought to know and explain.\r\n\r\n\"He might have stumbled into the house,\" he said, \"but he could not\r\nhave climbed the stairs.  Anyhow, he's not inside or outside, that I\r\ncan see.\"  The other members of the party had come back now, and no one\r\nhad found any trace of the old man.  His pipe, still warm, rested on\r\nthe edge of the rail, and inside on the table his old gray hat showed\r\nthat its owner had not gone far.\r\n\r\nHe was not far, after all.  From the table my eyes traveled around the\r\nroom, and stopped at the door of a closet.  I hardly know what impulse\r\nmoved me, but I went in and turned the knob. It burst open with the\r\nimpetus of a weight behind it, and something fell partly forward in a\r\nheap on the floor.  It was Thomas--Thomas without a mark of injury on\r\nhim, and dead.\r\n\nWarner was on his knees in a moment, fumbling at the old man's collar\r\nto loosen it, but Halsey caught his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Let him alone?\" he said.  \"You can't help him; he is dead.\"\r\n\r\nWe stood there, each avoiding the other's eyes; we spoke low and\r\nreverently in the presence of death, and we tacitly avoided any mention\r\nof the suspicion that was in every mind.  When Mr. Jamieson had\r\nfinished his cursory examination, he got up and dusted the knees of his\r\ntrousers.\r\n\r\n\"There is no sign of injury,\" he said, and I know I, for one, drew a\r\nlong breath of relief.  \"From what Warner says and from his hiding in\r\nthe closet, I should say he was scared to death. Fright and a weak\r\nheart, together.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what could have done it?\" Gertrude asked.  \"He was all right this\r\nevening at dinner.  Warner, what did he say when you found him on the\r\nporch?\"\r\n\r\nWarner looked shaken: his honest, boyish face was colorless.\r\n\r\n\"Just what I told you, Miss Innes.  He'd been reading the paper\r\ndown-stairs; I had put up the car, and, feeling sleepy, I came down to\r\nthe lodge to go to bed.  As I went up-stairs, Thomas put down the paper\r\nand, taking his pipe, went out on the porch. Then I heard an\r\nexclamation from him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he say?\" demanded Jamieson.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't hear, but his voice was strange; it sounded startled.  I\r\nwaited for him to call out again, but he did not, so I went\r\ndown-stairs.  He was sitting on the porch step, looking straight ahead,\r\nas if he saw something among the trees across the road.  And he kept\r\nmumbling about having seen a ghost.  He looked queer, and I tried to\r\nget him inside, but he wouldn't move.  Then I thought I'd better go up\r\nto the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't he say anything else you could understand?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"He said something about the grave giving up its dead.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson was going through the old man's pockets, and Gertrude was\r\ncomposing his arms, folding them across his white shirt-bosom, always\r\nso spotless.\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson looked up at me.\r\n\r\n\"What was that you said to me, Miss Innes, about the murder at the\r\nhouse being a beginning and not an end?  By jove, I believe you were\r\nright!\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of his investigations the detective had come to the inner\r\npocket of the dead butler's black coat.  Here he found some things that\r\ninterested him.  One was a small flat key, with a red cord tied to it,\r\nand the other was a bit of white paper, on which was written something\r\nin Thomas' cramped hand.  Mr. Jamieson read it: then he gave it to me.\r\nIt was an address in fresh ink--\r\n\r\n            LUCIEN WALLACE, 14 Elm Street, Richfield.\r\n\r\nAs the card went around, I think both the detective and I watched for\r\nany possible effect it might have, but, beyond perplexity, there seemed\r\nto be none.\r\n\r\n\"Richfield!\" Gertrude exclaimed.  \"Why, Elm Street is the main street;\r\ndon't you remember, Halsey?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucien Wallace!\" Halsey said.  \"That is the child Stewart spoke of at\r\nthe inquest.\"\r\n\r\nWarner, with his mechanic's instinct, had reached for the key. What he\r\nsaid was not a surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Yale lock,\" he said.  \"Probably a key to the east entry.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no reason why Thomas, an old and trusted servant, should not\r\nhave had a key to that particular door, although the servants' entry\r\nwas in the west wing.  But I had not known of this key, and it opened\r\nup a new field of conjecture.  Just now, however, there were many\r\nthings to be attended to, and, leaving Warner with the body, we all\r\nwent back to the house.  Mr. Jamieson walked with me, while Halsey and\r\nGertrude followed.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I shall have to notify the Armstrongs,\" I said.  \"They will\r\nknow if Thomas had any people and how to reach them.  Of course, I\r\nexpect to defray the expenses of the funeral, but his relatives must be\r\nfound.  What do you think frightened him, Mr. Jamieson?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is hard to say,\" he replied slowly, \"but I think we may be certain\r\nit was fright, and that he was hiding from something.  I am sorry in\r\nmore than one way:  I have always believed that Thomas knew something,\r\nor suspected something, that he would not tell.  Do you know how much\r\nmoney there was in that worn-out wallet of his?  Nearly a hundred\r\ndollars!  Almost two months' wages--and yet those darkies seldom have a\r\npenny.  Well--what Thomas knew will be buried with him.\"\r\n\r\nHalsey suggested that the grounds be searched, but Mr. Jamieson vetoed\r\nthe suggestion.\r\n\r\n\"You would find nothing,\" he said.  \"A person clever enough to get into\r\nSunnyside and tear a hole in the wall, while I watched down-stairs, is\r\nnot to be found by going around the shrubbery with a lantern.\"\r\n\r\nWith the death of Thomas, I felt that a climax had come in affairs at\r\nSunnyside.  The night that followed was quiet enough. Halsey watched at\r\nthe foot of the staircase, and a complicated system of bolts on the\r\nother doors seemed to be effectual.\r\n\r\nOnce in the night I wakened and thought I heard the tapping again.  But\r\nall was quiet, and I had reached the stage where I refused to be\r\ndisturbed for minor occurrences.\r\n\r\nThe Armstrongs were notified of Thomas' death, and I had my first\r\ninterview with Doctor Walker as a result.  He came up early the next\r\nmorning, just as we finished breakfast, in a professional looking car\r\nwith a black hood.  I found him striding up and down the living-room,\r\nand, in spite of my preconceived dislike, I had to admit that the man\r\nwas presentable.  A big fellow he was, tall and dark, as Gertrude had\r\nsaid, smooth-shaven and erect, with prominent features and a square\r\njaw.  He was painfully spruce in his appearance, and his manner was\r\nalmost obtrusively polite.\r\n\r\n\"I must make a double excuse for this early visit, Miss Innes,\" he said\r\nas he sat down.  The chair was lower than he expected, and his dignity\r\nrequired collecting before he went on.  \"My professional duties are\r\nurgent and long neglected, and\"--a fall to the every-day\r\nmanner--\"something must be done about that body.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said, sitting on the edge of my chair.  \"I merely wished the\r\naddress of Thomas' people.  You might have telephoned, if you were\r\nbusy.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled.\r\n\r\n\"I wished to see you about something else,\" he said.  \"As for Thomas,\r\nit is Mrs. Armstrong's wish that you would allow her to attend to the\r\nexpense.  About his relatives, I have already notified his brother, in\r\nthe village.  It was heart disease, I think.  Thomas always had a bad\r\nheart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heart disease and fright,\" I said, still on the edge of my chair.  But\r\nthe doctor had no intention of leaving.\r\n\r\n\"I understand you have a ghost up here, and that you have the house\r\nfilled with detectives to exorcise it,\" he said.\r\n\r\nFor some reason I felt I was being \"pumped,\" as Halsey says. \"You have\r\nbeen misinformed,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"What, no ghost, no detectives!\" he said, still with his smile. \"What a\r\ndisappointment to the village!\"\r\n\r\nI resented his attempt at playfulness.  It had been anything but a joke\r\nto us.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor Walker,\" I said tartly, \"I fail to see any humor in the\r\nsituation.  Since I came here, one man has been shot, and another one\r\nhas died from shock.  There have been intruders in the house, and\r\nstrange noises.  If that is funny, there is something wrong with my\r\nsense of humor.\"\r\n\r\n\"You miss the point,\" he said, still good-naturedly.  \"The thing that\r\nis funny, to me, is that you insist on remaining here, under the\r\ncircumstances.  I should think nothing would keep you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken.  Everything that occurs only confirms my resolution\r\nto stay until the mystery is cleared.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a message for you, Miss Innes,\" he said, rising at last.  \"Mrs.\r\nArmstrong asked me to thank you for your kindness to Louise, whose\r\nwhim, occurring at the time it did, put her to great inconvenience.\r\nAlso--and this is a delicate matter--she asked me to appeal to your\r\nnatural sympathy for her, at this time, and to ask you if you will not\r\nreconsider your decision about the house.  Sunnyside is her home; she\r\nloves it dearly, and just now she wishes to retire here for quiet and\r\npeace.\"\r\n\r\n\"She must have had a change of heart,\" I said, ungraciously enough.\r\n\"Louise told me her mother despised the place.  Besides, this is no\r\nplace for quiet and peace just now.  Anyhow, doctor, while I don't care\r\nto force an issue, I shall certainly remain here, for a time at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"For how long?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"My lease is for six months.  I shall stay until some explanation is\r\nfound for certain things.  My own family is implicated now, and I shall\r\ndo everything to clear the mystery of Arnold Armstrong's murder.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor stood looking down, slapping his gloves thoughtfully against\r\nthe palm of a well-looked-after hand.\r\n\r\n\"You say there have been intruders in the house?\" he asked. \"You are\r\nsure of that, Miss Innes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certain.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what part?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the east wing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell me when these intrusions occurred, and what the purpose\r\nseemed to be?  Was it robbery?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said decidedly.  \"As to time, once on Friday night a week ago,\r\nagain the following night, when Arnold Armstrong was murdered, and\r\nagain last Friday night.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked serious.  He seemed to be debating some question in\r\nhis mind, and to reach a decision.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Innes,\" he said, \"I am in a peculiar position; I understand your\r\nattitude, of course; but--do you think you are wise?  Ever since you\r\nhave come here there have been hostile demonstrations against you and\r\nyour family.  I'm not a croaker, but--take a warning.  Leave before\r\nanything occurs that will cause you a lifelong regret.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am willing to take the responsibility,\" I said coldly.\r\n\r\nI think he gave me up then as a poor proposition.  He asked to be shown\r\nwhere Arnold Armstrong's body had been found, and I took him there.  He\r\nscrutinized the whole place carefully, examining the stairs and the\r\nlock.  When he had taken a formal farewell I was confident of one\r\nthing.  Doctor Walker would do anything he could to get me away from\r\nSunnyside.\r\n\nIt was Monday evening when we found the body of poor old Thomas. Monday\r\nnight had been uneventful; things were quiet at the house and the\r\npeculiar circumstances of the old man's death had been carefully kept\r\nfrom the servants.  Rosie took charge of the dining-room and pantry, in\r\nthe absence of a butler, and, except for the warning of the Casanova\r\ndoctor, everything breathed of peace.\r\n\r\nAffairs at the Traders' Bank were progressing slowly.  The failure had\r\nhit small stock-holders very hard, the minister of the little Methodist\r\nchapel in Casanova among them.  He had received as a legacy from an\r\nuncle a few shares of stock in the Traders' Bank, and now his joy was\r\nturned to bitterness: he had to sacrifice everything he had in the\r\nworld, and his feeling against Paul Armstrong, dead, as he was, must\r\nhave been bitter in the extreme.  He was asked to officiate at the\r\nsimple services when the dead banker's body was interred in Casanova\r\nchurchyard, but the good man providentially took cold, and a substitute\r\nwas called in.\r\n\r\nA few days after the services he called to see me, a kind-faced little\r\nman, in a very bad frock-coat and laundered tie.  I think he was\r\nuncertain as to my connection with the Armstrong family, and dubious\r\nwhether I considered Mr. Armstrong's taking away a matter for\r\ncondolence or congratulation.  He was not long in doubt.\r\n\r\nI liked the little man.  He had known Thomas well, and had promised to\r\nofficiate at the services in the rickety African Zion Church.  He told\r\nme more of himself than he knew, and before he left, I astonished\r\nhim--and myself, I admit--by promising a new carpet for his church.  He\r\nwas much affected, and I gathered that he had yearned over his ragged\r\nchapel as a mother over a half-clothed child.\r\n\r\n\"You are laying up treasure, Miss Innes,\" he said brokenly, \"where\r\nneither moth nor rust corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is certainly a safer place than Sunnyside,\" I admitted.  And the\r\nthought of the carpet permitted him to smile.  He stood just inside the\r\ndoorway, looking from the luxury of the house to the beauty of the view.\r\n\r\n\"The rich ought to be good,\" he said wistfully.  \"They have so much\r\nthat is beautiful, and beauty is ennobling.  And yet--while I ought to\r\nsay nothing but good of the dead--Mr. Armstrong saw nothing of this\r\nfair prospect.  To him these trees and lawns were not the work of God.\r\nThey were property, at so much an acre.  He loved money, Miss Innes.\r\nHe offered up everything to his golden calf.  Not power, not ambition,\r\nwas his fetish: it was money.\" Then he dropped his pulpit manner, and,\r\nturning to me with his engaging smile:  \"In spite of all this luxury,\"\r\nhe said, \"the country people here have a saying that Mr. Paul Armstrong\r\ncould sit on a dollar and see all around it.  Unlike the summer people,\r\nhe gave neither to the poor nor to the church.  He loved money for its\r\nown sake.\"\r\n\r\n\"And there are no pockets in shrouds!\" I said cynically.\r\n\r\nI sent him home in the car, with a bunch of hot-house roses for his\r\nwife, and he was quite overwhelmed.  As for me, I had a generous glow\r\nthat was cheap at the price of a church carpet.  I received less\r\ngratification--and less gratitude--when I presented the new silver\r\ncommunion set to St. Barnabas.\r\n\r\nI had a great many things to think about in those days.  I made out a\r\nlist of questions and possible answers, but I seemed only to be working\r\naround in a circle.  I always ended where I began. The list was\r\nsomething like this:\r\n\r\n\r\nWho had entered the house the night before the murder?\r\n\r\nThomas claimed it was Mr. Bailey, whom he had seen on the foot-path,\r\nand who owned the pearl cuff-link.\r\n\r\nWhy did Arnold Armstrong come back after he had left the house the\r\nnight he was killed?\r\n\r\nNo answer.  Was it on the mission Louise had mentioned?\r\n\r\nWho admitted him?\r\n\r\nGertrude said she had locked the east entry.  There was no key on the\r\ndead man or in the door.  He must have been admitted from within.\r\n\r\nWho had been locked in the clothes chute?\r\n\r\nSome one unfamiliar with the house, evidently.  Only two people missing\r\nfrom the household, Rosie and Gertrude.  Rosie had been at the lodge.\r\nTherefore--but was it Gertrude?  Might it not have been the mysterious\r\nintruder again?\r\n\r\nWho had accosted Rosie on the drive?\r\n\r\nAgain--perhaps the nightly visitor.  It seemed more likely some one who\r\nsuspected a secret at the lodge.  Was Louise under surveillance?\r\n\r\nWho had passed Louise on the circular staircase?\r\n\r\nCould it have been Thomas?  The key to the east entry made this a\r\npossibility.  But why was he there, if it were indeed he?\r\n\r\nWho had made the hole in the trunk-room wall?\r\n\r\nIt was not vandalism.  It had been done quietly, and with deliberate\r\npurpose.  If I had only known how to read the purpose of that gaping\r\naperture what I might have saved in anxiety and mental strain!\r\n\r\nWhy had Louise left her people and come home to hide at the lodge?\r\n\r\nThere was no answer, as yet, to this, or to the next questions.\r\n\r\nWhy did both she and Doctor Walker warn us away from the house?\r\n\r\nWho was Lucien Wallace?\r\n\r\nWhat did Thomas see in the shadows the night he died?\r\n\r\nWhat was the meaning of the subtle change in Gertrude?\r\n\r\nWas Jack Bailey an accomplice or a victim in the looting of the\r\nTraders' Bank?\r\n\r\nWhat all-powerful reason made Louise determine to marry Doctor Walker?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe examiners were still working on the books of the Traders' Bank, and\r\nit was probable that several weeks would elapse before everything was\r\ncleared up.  The firm of expert accountants who had examined the books\r\nsome two months before testified that every bond, every piece of\r\nvaluable paper, was there at that time.  It had been shortly after\r\ntheir examination that the president, who had been in bad health, had\r\ngone to California. Mr. Bailey was still ill at the Knickerbocker, and\r\nin this, as in other ways, Gertrude's conduct puzzled me.  She seemed\r\nindifferent, refused to discuss matters pertaining to the bank, and\r\nnever, to my knowledge, either wrote to him or went to see him.\r\n\r\nGradually I came to the conclusion that Gertrude, with the rest of the\r\nworld, believed her lover guilty, and--although I believed it myself,\r\nfor that matter--I was irritated by her indifference. Girls in my day\r\ndid not meekly accept the public's verdict as to the man they loved.\r\n\r\nBut presently something occurred that made me think that under\r\nGertrude's surface calm there was a seething flood of emotions.\r\n\r\nTuesday morning the detective made a careful search of the grounds, but\r\nhe found nothing.  In the afternoon he disappeared, and it was late\r\nthat night when he came home.  He said he would have to go back to the\r\ncity the following day, and arranged with Halsey and Alex to guard the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nLiddy came to me on Wednesday morning with her black silk apron held up\r\nlike a bag, and her eyes big with virtuous wrath.  It was the day of\r\nThomas' funeral in the village, and Alex and I were in the conservatory\r\ncutting flowers for the old man's casket.  Liddy is never so happy as\r\nwhen she is making herself wretched, and now her mouth drooped while\r\nher eyes were triumphant.\r\n\r\n\"I always said there were plenty of things going on here, right under\r\nour noses, that we couldn't see,\" she said, holding out her apron.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see with my nose,\" I remarked.  \"What have you got there?\"\r\n\r\nLiddy pushed aside a half-dozen geranium pots, and in the space thus\r\ncleared she dumped the contents of her apron--a handful of tiny bits of\r\npaper.  Alex had stepped back, but I saw him watching her curiously.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment, Liddy,\" I said.  \"You have been going through the\r\nlibrary paper-basket again!\"\r\n\r\nLiddy was arranging her bits of paper with the skill of long practice\r\nand paid no attention.\r\n\r\n\"Did it ever occur to you,\" I went on, putting my hand over the scraps,\r\n\"that when people tear up their correspondence, it is for the express\r\npurpose of keeping it from being read?\"\r\n\r\n\"If they wasn't ashamed of it they wouldn't take so much trouble, Miss\r\nRachel,\" Liddy said oracularly.  \"More than that, with things happening\r\nevery day, I consider it my duty.  If you don't read and act on this, I\r\nshall give it to that Jamieson, and I'll venture he'll not go back to\r\nthe city to-day.\"\r\n\r\nThat decided me.  If the scraps had anything to do with the mystery\r\nordinary conventions had no value.  So Liddy arranged the scraps, like\r\nworking out one of the puzzle-pictures children play with, and she did\r\nit with much the same eagerness.  When it was finished she stepped\r\naside while I read it.\r\n\r\n\"Wednesday night, nine o'clock.  Bridge,\" I real aloud.  Then, aware of\r\nAlex's stare, I turned on Liddy.\r\n\r\n\"Some one is to play bridge to-night at nine o'clock,\" I said. \"Is that\r\nyour business, or mine?\"\r\n\r\nLiddy was aggrieved.  She was about to reply when I scooped up the\r\npieces and left the conservatory.\r\n\r\n\"Now then,\" I said, when we got outside, \"will you tell me why you\r\nchoose to take Alex into your confidence?  He's no fool.  Do you\r\nsuppose he thinks any one in this house is going to play bridge\r\nto-night at nine o'clock, by appointment!  I suppose you have shown it\r\nin the kitchen, and instead of my being able to slip down to the bridge\r\nto-night quietly, and see who is there, the whole household will be\r\ngoing in a procession.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody knows it,\" Liddy said humbly.  \"I found it in the basket in\r\nMiss Gertrude's dressing-room.  Look at the back of the sheet.\"  I\r\nturned over some of the scraps, and, sure enough, it was a blank\r\ndeposit slip from the Traders' Bank.  So Gertrude was going to meet\r\nJack Bailey that night by the bridge!  And I had thought he was ill!\r\nIt hardly seemed like the action of an innocent man--this avoidance of\r\ndaylight, and of his fiancee's people.  I decided to make certain,\r\nhowever, by going to the bridge that night.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon Mr. Jamieson suggested that I go with him to Richfield,\r\nand I consented.\r\n\r\n\"I am inclined to place more faith in Doctor Stewart's story,\" he said,\r\n\"since I found that scrap in old Thomas' pocket.  It bears out the\r\nstatement that the woman with the child, and the woman who quarreled\r\nwith Armstrong, are the same.  It looks as if Thomas had stumbled on to\r\nsome affair which was more or less discreditable to the dead man, and,\r\nwith a certain loyalty to the family, had kept it to himself.  Then,\r\nyou see, your story about the woman at the card-room window begins to\r\nmean something.  It is the nearest approach to anything tangible that\r\nwe have had yet.\"\r\n\r\nWarner took us to Richfield in the car.  It was about twenty-five miles\r\nby railroad, but by taking a series of atrociously rough short cuts we\r\ngot there very quickly.  It was a pretty little town, on the river, and\r\nback on the hill I could see the Mortons' big country house, where\r\nHalsey and Gertrude had been staying until the night of the murder.\r\n\r\nElm Street was almost the only street, and number fourteen was easily\r\nfound.  It was a small white house, dilapidated without having gained\r\nanything picturesque, with a low window and a porch only a foot or so\r\nabove the bit of a lawn.  There was a baby-carriage in the path, and\r\nfrom a swing at the side came the sound of conflict.  Three small\r\nchildren were disputing vociferously, and a faded young woman with a\r\nkindly face was trying to hush the clamor.  When she saw us she untied\r\nher gingham apron and came around to the porch.\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon,\" I said.  Jamieson lifted his hat, without speaking.\r\n\"I came to inquire about a child named Lucien Wallace.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you have come,\" she said.  \"In spite of the other children,\r\nI think the little fellow is lonely.  We thought perhaps his mother\r\nwould be here to-day.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson stepped forward.\r\n\r\n\"You are Mrs. Tate?\" I wondered how the detective knew.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Tate, we want to make some inquiries.  Perhaps in the house--\"\r\n\r\n\"Come right in,\" she said hospitably.  And soon we were in the little\r\nshabby parlor, exactly like a thousand of its prototypes. Mrs. Tate sat\r\nuneasily, her hands folded in her lap.\r\n\r\n\"How long has Lucien been here?\" Mr. Jamieson asked.\r\n\r\n\"Since a week ago last Friday.  His mother paid one week's board in\r\nadvance; the other has not been paid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was he ill when he came?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, not what you'd call sick.  He was getting better of typhoid,\r\nshe said, and he's picking up fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you tell me his mother's name and address?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the trouble,\" the young woman said, knitting her brows. \"She\r\ngave her name as Mrs. Wallace, and said she had no address. She was\r\nlooking for a boarding-house in town.  She said she worked in a\r\ndepartment store, and couldn't take care of the child properly, and he\r\nneeded fresh air and milk.  I had three children of my own, and one\r\nmore didn't make much difference in the work, but--I wish she would pay\r\nthis week's board.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she say what store it was?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, but all the boy's clothes came from King's.  He has far too\r\nfine clothes for the country.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a chorus of shouts and shrill yells from the front door,\r\nfollowed by the loud stamping of children's feet and a throaty \"whoa,\r\nwhoa!\"  Into the room came a tandem team of two chubby youngsters, a\r\nboy and a girl, harnessed with a clothes-line, and driven by a laughing\r\nboy of about seven, in tan overalls and brass buttons.  The small\r\ndriver caught my attention at once: he was a beautiful child, and,\r\nalthough he showed traces of recent severe illness, his skin had now\r\nthe clear transparency of health.\r\n\r\n\"Whoa, Flinders,\" he shouted.  \"You're goin' to smash the trap.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson coaxed him over by holding out a lead-pencil, striped blue\r\nand yellow.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then,\" he said, when the boy had taken the lead-pencil and was\r\ntesting its usefulness on the detective's cuff, \"now then, I'll bet you\r\ndon't know what your name is!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" said the boy.  \"Lucien Wallace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great!  And what's your mother's name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother, of course.  What's your mother's name?\"  And he pointed to me!\r\nI am going to stop wearing black: it doubles a woman's age.\r\n\r\n\"And where did you live before you came here?\"  The detective was\r\npolite enough not to smile.\r\n\r\n\"Grossmutter,\" he said.  And I saw Mr. Jamieson's eyebrows go up.\r\n\r\n\"German,\" he commented.  \"Well, young man, you don't seem to know much\r\nabout yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've tried it all week,\" Mrs. Tate broke in.  \"The boy knows a word or\r\ntwo of German, but he doesn't know where he lived, or anything about\r\nhimself.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson wrote something on a card and gave it to her.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Tate,\" he said, \"I want you to do something.  Here is some money\r\nfor the telephone call.  The instant the boy's mother appears here,\r\ncall up that number and ask for the person whose name is there.  You\r\ncan run across to the drug-store on an errand and do it quietly.  Just\r\nsay, 'The lady has come.'\"\r\n\r\n\"'The lady has come,'\" repeated Mrs. Tate.  \"Very well, sir, and I hope\r\nit will be soon.  The milk-bill alone is almost double what it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much is the child's board?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Three dollars a week, including his washing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" I said.  \"Now, Mrs. Tate, I am going to pay last week's\r\nboard and a week in advance.  If the mother comes, she is to know\r\nnothing of this visit--absolutely not a word, and, in return for your\r\nsilence, you may use this money for--something for your own children.\"\r\n\r\nHer tired, faded face lighted up, and I saw her glance at the little\r\nTates' small feet.  Shoes, I divined--the feet of the genteel poor\r\nbeing almost as expensive as their stomachs.\r\n\r\nAs we went back Mr. Jamieson made only one remark:  I think he was\r\nlaboring under the weight of a great disappointment.\r\n\r\n\"Is King's a children's outfitting place?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not especially.  It is a general department store.\"\r\n\r\nHe was silent after that, but he went to the telephone as soon as we\r\ngot home, and called up King and Company, in the city.\r\n\r\nAfter a time he got the general manager, and they talked for some time.\r\nWhen Mr. Jamieson hung up the receiver he turned to me.\r\n\r\n\"The plot thickens,\" he said with his ready smile.  \"There are four\r\nwomen named Wallace at King's none of them married, and none over\r\ntwenty.  I think I shall go up to the city to-night. I want to go to\r\nthe Children's Hospital.  But before I go, Miss Innes, I wish you would\r\nbe more frank with me than you have been yet.  I want you to show me\r\nthe revolver you picked up in the tulip bed.\"\r\n\r\nSo he had known all along!\r\n\r\n\"It WAS a revolver, Mr. Jamieson,\" I admitted, cornered at last, \"but I\r\ncan not show it to you.  It is not in my possession.\"\r\n\nAt dinner Mr. Jamieson suggested sending a man out in his place for a\r\ncouple of days, but Halsey was certain there would be nothing more, and\r\nfelt that he and Alex could manage the situation.  The detective went\r\nback to town early in the evening, and by nine o'clock Halsey, who had\r\nbeen playing golf--as a man does anything to take his mind away from\r\ntrouble--was sleeping soundly on the big leather davenport in the\r\nliving-room.\r\n\r\nI sat and knitted, pretending not to notice when Gertrude got up and\r\nwandered out into the starlight.  As soon as I was satisfied that she\r\nhad gone, however, I went out cautiously.  I had no intention of\r\neavesdropping, but I wanted to be certain that it was Jack Bailey she\r\nwas meeting.  Too many things had occurred in which Gertrude was, or\r\nappeared to be, involved, to allow anything to be left in question.\r\n\r\nI went slowly across the lawn, skirted the hedge to a break not far\r\nfrom the lodge, and found myself on the open road.  Perhaps a hundred\r\nfeet to the left the path led across the valley to the Country Club,\r\nand only a little way off was the foot-bridge over Casanova Creek.  But\r\njust as I was about to turn down the path I heard steps coming toward\r\nme, and I shrank into the bushes.  It was Gertrude, going back quickly\r\ntoward the house.\r\n\r\nI was surprised.  I waited until she had had time to get almost to the\r\nhouse before I started.  And then I stepped back again into the\r\nshadows.  The reason why Gertrude had not kept her tryst was evident.\r\nLeaning on the parapet of the bridge in the moonlight, and smoking a\r\npipe, was Alex, the gardener.  I could have throttled Liddy for her\r\ncarelessness in reading the torn note where he could hear.  And I could\r\ncheerfully have choked Alex to death for his audacity.\r\n\r\nBut there was no help for it: I turned and followed Gertrude slowly\r\nback to the house.\r\n\r\nThe frequent invasions of the house had effectually prevented any\r\nrelaxation after dusk.  We had redoubled our vigilance as to bolts and\r\nwindow-locks but, as Mr. Jamieson had suggested, we allowed the door at\r\nthe east entry to remain as before, locked by the Yale lock only.  To\r\nprovide only one possible entrance for the invader, and to keep a\r\nconstant guard in the dark at the foot of the circular staircase,\r\nseemed to be the only method.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of the detective, Alex and Halsey arranged to change\r\noff, Halsey to be on duty from ten to two, and Alex from two until six.\r\nEach man was armed, and, as an additional precaution, the one off duty\r\nslept in a room near the head of the circular staircase and kept his\r\ndoor open, to be ready for emergency.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements were carefully kept from the servants, who were only\r\ncommencing to sleep at night, and who retired, one and all, with barred\r\ndoors and lamps that burned full until morning.\r\n\r\nThe house was quiet again Wednesday night.  It was almost a week since\r\nLouise had encountered some one on the stairs, and it was four days\r\nsince the discovery of the hole in the trunk-room wall.\r\n\r\nArnold Armstrong and his father rested side by side in the Casanova\r\nchurchyard, and at the Zion African Church, on the hill, a new mound\r\nmarked the last resting-place of poor Thomas.\r\n\r\n\r\nLouise was with her mother in town, and, beyond a polite note of thanks\r\nto me, we had heard nothing from her.  Doctor Walker had taken up his\r\npractice again, and we saw him now and then flying past along the road,\r\nalways at top speed.  The murder of Arnold Armstrong was still\r\nunavenged, and I remained firm in the position I had taken--to stay at\r\nSunnyside until the thing was at least partly cleared.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, for all its quiet, it was on Wednesday night that perhaps the\r\nboldest attempt was made to enter the house.  On Thursday afternoon the\r\nlaundress sent word she would like to speak to me, and I saw her in my\r\nprivate sitting-room, a small room beyond the dressing-room.\r\n\r\nMary Anne was embarrassed.  She had rolled down her sleeves and tied a\r\nwhite apron around her waist, and she stood making folds in it with\r\nfingers that were red and shiny from her soap-suds.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mary,\" I said encouragingly, \"what's the matter?  Don't dare to\r\ntell me the soap is out.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, ma'm, Miss Innes.\"  She had a nervous habit of looking first at my\r\none eye and then at the other, her own optics shifting ceaselessly,\r\nright eye, left eye, right eye, until I found myself doing the same\r\nthing.  \"No, ma'm.  I was askin' did you want the ladder left up the\r\nclothes chute?\"\r\n\r\n\"The what?\" I screeched, and was sorry the next minute.  Seeing her\r\nsuspicions were verified, Mary Anne had gone white, and stood with her\r\neyes shifting more wildly than ever.\r\n\r\n\"There's a ladder up the clothes chute, Miss Innes,\" she said. \"It's up\r\nthat tight I can't move it, and I didn't like to ask for help until I\r\nspoke to you.\"\r\n\r\nIt was useless to dissemble; Mary Anne knew now as well as I did that\r\nthe ladder had no business to be there.  I did the best I could,\r\nhowever.  I put her on the defensive at once.\r\n\r\n\"Then you didn't lock the laundry last night?\"\r\n\r\n\"I locked it tight, and put the key in the kitchen on its nail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then you forgot a window.\"\r\n\r\nMary Anne hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Yes'm,\" she said at last.  \"I thought I locked them all, but there was\r\none open this morning.\"\r\n\r\nI went out of the room and down the hall, followed by Mary Anne. The\r\ndoor into the clothes chute was securely bolted, and when I opened it I\r\nsaw the evidence of the woman's story.  A pruning-ladder had been\r\nbrought from where it had lain against the stable and now stood upright\r\nin the clothes shaft, its end resting against the wall between the\r\nfirst and second floors.\r\n\r\nI turned to Mary.\r\n\r\n\"This is due to your carelessness,\" I said.  \"If we had all been\r\nmurdered in our beds it would have been your fault.\"  She shivered.\r\n\"Now, not a word of this through the house, and send Alex to me.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect on Alex was to make him apoplectic with rage, and with it\r\nall I fancied there was an element of satisfaction.  As I look back, so\r\nmany things are plain to me that I wonder I could not see at the time.\r\nIt is all known now, and yet the whole thing was so remarkable that\r\nperhaps my stupidity was excusable.\r\n\r\nAlex leaned down the chute and examined the ladder carefully.\r\n\r\n\"It is caught,\" he said with a grim smile.  \"The fools, to have left a\r\nwarning like that!  The only trouble is, Miss Innes, they won't be apt\r\nto come back for a while.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't regard that in the light of a calamity,\" I replied.\r\n\r\nUntil late that evening Halsey and Alex worked at the chute. They\r\nforced down the ladder at last, and put a new bolt on the door.  As for\r\nmyself, I sat and wondered if I had a deadly enemy, intent on my\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nI was growing more and more nervous.  Liddy had given up all pretense\r\nat bravery, and slept regularly in my dressing-room on the couch, with\r\na prayer-book and a game knife from the kitchen under her pillow, thus\r\npreparing for both the natural and the supernatural.  That was the way\r\nthings stood that Thursday night, when I myself took a hand in the\r\nstruggle.\r\n\nAbout nine o'clock that night Liddy came into the living-room and\r\nreported that one of the housemaids declared she had seen two men slip\r\naround the corner of the stable.  Gertrude had been sitting staring in\r\nfront of her, jumping at every sound.  Now she turned on Liddy\r\npettishly.\r\n\r\n\"I declare, Liddy,\" she said, \"you are a bundle of nerves.  What if\r\nEliza did see some men around the stable?  It may have been Warner and\r\nAlex.\"\r\n\r\n\"Warner is in the kitchen, miss,\" Liddy said with dignity.  \"And if you\r\nhad come through what I have, you would be a bundle of nerves, too.\r\nMiss Rachel, I'd be thankful if you'd give me my month's wages\r\nto-morrow.  I'll be going to my sister's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" I said, to her evident amazement.  \"I will make out the\r\ncheck.  Warner can take you down to the noon train.\"\r\n\r\nLiddy's face was really funny.\r\n\r\n\"You'll have a nice time at your sister's,\" I went on.  \"Five children,\r\nhasn't she?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it,\" Liddy said, suddenly bursting into tears.  \"Send me away,\r\nafter all these years, and your new shawl only half done, and nobody\r\nknowin' how to fix the water for your bath.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's time I learned to prepare my own bath.\"  I was knitting\r\ncomplacently.  But Gertrude got up and put her arms around Liddy's\r\nshaking shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"You are two big babies,\" she said soothingly.  \"Neither one of you\r\ncould get along for an hour without the other.  So stop quarreling and\r\nbe good.  Liddy, go right up and lay out Aunty's night things.  She is\r\ngoing to bed early.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Liddy had gone I began to think about the men at the stable, and\r\nI grew more and more anxious.  Halsey was aimlessly knocking the\r\nbilliard-balls around in the billiard-room, and I called to him.\r\n\r\n\"Halsey,\" I said when he sauntered in, \"is there a policeman in\r\nCasanova?\"\r\n\r\n\"Constable,\" he said laconically.  \"Veteran of the war, one arm; in\r\noffice to conciliate the G. A. R. element.  Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I am uneasy to-night.\"  And I told him what Liddy had said.\r\n\"Is there any one you can think of who could be relied on to watch the\r\noutside of the house to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"We might get Sam Bohannon from the club,\" he said thoughtfully. \"It\r\nwouldn't be a bad scheme.  He's a smart darky, and with his mouth shut\r\nand his shirt-front covered, you couldn't see him a yard off in the\r\ndark.\"\r\n\r\nHalsey conferred with Alex, and the result, in an hour, was Sam. His\r\ninstructions were simple.  There had been numerous attempts to break\r\ninto the house; it was the intention, not to drive intruders away, but\r\nto capture them.  If Sam saw anything suspicious outside, he was to tap\r\nat the east entry, where Alex and Halsey were to alternate in keeping\r\nwatch through the night.\r\n\r\nIt was with a comfortable feeling of security that I went to bed that\r\nnight.  The door between Gertrude's rooms and mine had been opened,\r\nand, with the doors into the hall bolted, we were safe enough.\r\nAlthough Liddy persisted in her belief that doors would prove no\r\nobstacles to our disturbers.\r\n\r\nAs before, Halsey watched the east entry from ten until two. He had an\r\neye to comfort, and he kept vigil in a heavy oak chair, very large and\r\ndeep.  We went up-stairs rather early, and through the open door\r\nGertrude and I kept up a running fire of conversation.  Liddy was\r\nbrushing my hair, and Gertrude was doing her own, with a long free\r\nsweep of her strong round arms.\r\n\r\n\"Did you know Mrs. Armstrong and Louise are in the village?\" she called.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I replied, startled.  \"How did you hear it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I met the oldest Stewart girl to-day, the doctor's daughter, and she\r\ntold me they had not gone back to town after the funeral. They went\r\ndirectly to that little yellow house next to Doctor Walker's, and are\r\napparently settled there.  They took the house furnished for the\r\nsummer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's a bandbox,\" I said.  \"I can't imagine Fanny Armstrong in\r\nsuch a place.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's true, nevertheless.  Ella Stewart says Mrs. Armstrong has aged\r\nterribly, and looks as if she is hardly able to walk.\"\r\n\r\nI lay and thought over some of these things until midnight.  The\r\nelectric lights went out then, fading slowly until there was only a\r\nred-hot loop to be seen in the bulb, and then even that died away and\r\nwe were embarked on the darkness of another night.\r\n\r\nApparently only a few minutes elapsed, during which my eyes were\r\nbecoming accustomed to the darkness.  Then I noticed that the windows\r\nwere reflecting a faint pinkish light, Liddy noticed it at the same\r\ntime, and I heard her jump up.  At that moment Sam's deep voice boomed\r\nfrom somewhere just below.\r\n\r\n\"Fire!\" he yelled.  \"The stable's on fire!\"\r\n\r\nI could see him in the glare dancing up and down on the drive, and a\r\nmoment later Halsey joined him.  Alex was awake and running down the\r\nstairs, and in five minutes from the time the fire was discovered,\r\nthree of the maids were sitting on their trunks in the drive, although,\r\nexcepting a few sparks, there was no fire nearer than a hundred yards.\r\n\r\nGertrude seldom loses her presence of mind, and she ran to the\r\ntelephone.  But by the time the Casanova volunteer fire department came\r\ntoiling up the hill the stable was a furnace, with the Dragon Fly safe\r\nbut blistered, in the road.  Some gasolene exploded just as the\r\nvolunteer department got to work, which shook their nerves as well as\r\nthe burning building.  The stable, being on a hill, was a torch to\r\nattract the population from every direction.  Rumor had it that\r\nSunnyside was burning, and it was amazing how many people threw\r\nsomething over their night-clothes and flew to the conflagration.\r\n\r\nI take it Casanova has few fires, and Sunnyside was furnishing the\r\npeople, in one way and another, the greatest excitement they had had\r\nfor years.\r\n\r\nThe stable was off the west wing.  I hardly know how I came to think of\r\nthe circular staircase and the unguarded door at its foot.  Liddy was\r\nputting my clothes into sheets, preparatory to tossing them out the\r\nwindow, when I found her, and I could hardly persuade her to stop.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to come with me, Liddy,\" I said.  \"Bring a candle and a\r\ncouple of blankets.\"\r\n\r\nShe lagged behind considerably when she saw me making for the east\r\nwing, and at the top of the staircase she balked.\r\n\r\n\"I am not going down there,\" she said firmly.\r\n\r\n\"There is no one guarding the door down there,\" I explained. \"Who\r\nknows?--this may be a scheme to draw everybody away from this end of\r\nthe house, and let some one in here.\"\r\n\r\nThe instant I had said it I was convinced I had hit on the explanation,\r\nand that perhaps it was already too late.  It seemed to me as I\r\nlistened that I heard stealthy footsteps on the east porch, but there\r\nwas so much shouting outside that it was impossible to tell.  Liddy was\r\non the point of retreat.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" I said, \"then I shall go down alone.  Run back to Mr.\r\nHalsey's room and get his revolver.  Don't shoot down the stairs if you\r\nhear a noise: remember--I shall be down there.  And hurry.\"\r\n\r\nI put the candle on the floor at the top of the staircase and took off\r\nmy bedroom slippers.  Then I crept down the stairs, going very slowly,\r\nand listening with all my ears.  I was keyed to such a pitch that I\r\nfelt no fear: like the condemned who sleep and eat the night before\r\nexecution, I was no longer able to suffer apprehension.  I was past\r\nthat.  Just at the foot of the stairs I stubbed my toe against Halsey's\r\nbig chair, and had to stand on one foot in a soundless agony until the\r\npain subsided to a dull ache.  And then--I knew I was right.  Some one\r\nhad put a key into the lock, and was turning it.  For some reason it\r\nrefused to work, and the key was withdrawn.  There was a muttering of\r\nvoices outside: I had only a second.  Another trial, and the door would\r\nopen.  The candle above made a faint gleam down the well-like\r\nstaircase, and at that moment, with a second, no more, to spare, I\r\nthought of a plan.\r\n\r\nThe heavy oak chair almost filled the space between the newel post and\r\nthe door.  With a crash I had turned it on its side, wedging it against\r\nthe door, its legs against the stairs.  I could hear a faint scream\r\nfrom Liddy, at the crash, and then she came down the stairs on a run,\r\nwith the revolver held straight out in front of her.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God,\" she said, in a shaking voice.  \"I thought it was you.\"\r\n\r\nI pointed to the door, and she understood.\r\n\r\n\"Call out the windows at the other end of the house,\" I whispered.\r\n\"Run.  Tell them not to wait for anything.\"\r\n\r\nShe went up the stairs at that, two at a time.  Evidently she collided\r\nwith the candle, for it went out, and I was left in darkness.\r\n\r\nI was really astonishingly cool.  I remember stepping over the chair\r\nand gluing my ear to the door, and I shall never forget feeling it give\r\nan inch or two there in the darkness, under a steady pressure from\r\nwithout.  But the chair held, although I could hear an ominous cracking\r\nof one of the legs.  And then, without the slightest warning, the\r\ncard-room window broke with a crash.  I had my finger on the trigger of\r\nthe revolver, and as I jumped it went off, right through the door.\r\nSome one outside swore roundly, and for the first time I could hear\r\nwhat was said.\r\n\r\n\"Only a scratch. . . .  Men are at the other end of the house. . . .\r\nHave the whole rat's nest on us.\"  And a lot of profanity which I won't\r\nwrite down.  The voices were at the broken window now, and although I\r\nwas trembling violently, I was determined that I would hold them until\r\nhelp came.  I moved up the stairs until I could see into the card-room,\r\nor rather through it, to the window.  As I looked a small man put his\r\nleg over the sill and stepped into the room.  The curtain confused him\r\nfor a moment; then he turned, not toward me, but toward the\r\nbilliard-room door.  I fired again, and something that was glass or\r\nchina crashed to the ground.  Then I ran up the stairs and along the\r\ncorridor to the main staircase.  Gertrude was standing there, trying to\r\nlocate the shots, and I must have been a peculiar figure, with my hair\r\nin crimps, my dressing-gown flying, no slippers, and a revolver\r\nclutched in my hands I had no time to talk.  There was the sound of\r\nfootsteps in the lower hall, and some one bounded up the stairs.\r\n\r\nI had gone Berserk, I think.  I leaned over the stair-rail and fired\r\nagain.  Halsey, below, yelled at me.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing up there?\" he yelled.  \"You missed me by an inch.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then I collapsed and fainted.  When I came around Liddy was rubbing\r\nmy temples with eau de quinine, and the search was in full blast.\r\n\r\nWell, the man was gone.  The stable burned to the ground, while the\r\ncrowd cheered at every falling rafter, and the volunteer fire\r\ndepartment sprayed it with a garden hose.  And in the house Alex and\r\nHalsey searched every corner of the lower floor, finding no one.\r\n\r\nThe truth of my story was shown by the broken window and the overturned\r\nchair.  That the unknown had got up-stairs was almost impossible.  He\r\nhad not used the main staircase, there was no way to the upper floor in\r\nthe east wing, and Liddy had been at the window, in the west wing,\r\nwhere the servants' stair went up.  But we did not go to bed at all.\r\nSam Bohannon and Warner helped in the search, and not a closet escaped\r\nscrutiny.  Even the cellars were given a thorough overhauling, without\r\nresult.  The door in the east entry had a hole through it where my\r\nbullet had gone.\r\n\r\nThe hole slanted downward, and the bullet was embedded in the porch.\r\nSome reddish stains showed it had done execution.\r\n\r\n\"Somebody will walk lame,\" Halsey said, when he had marked the course\r\nof the bullet.  \"It's too low to have hit anything but a leg or foot.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that time on I watched every person I met for a limp, and to this\r\nday the man who halts in his walk is an object of suspicion to me.  But\r\nCasanova had no lame men: the nearest approach to it was an old fellow\r\nwho tended the safety gates at the railroad, and he, I learned on\r\ninquiry, had two artificial legs.  Our man had gone, and the large and\r\nexpensive stable at Sunnyside was a heap of smoking rafters and charred\r\nboards.  Warner swore the fire was incendiary, and in view of the\r\nattempt to enter the house, there seemed to be no doubt of it.\r\n\nIf Halsey had only taken me fully into his confidence, through the\r\nwhole affair, it would have been much simpler.  If he had been\r\naltogether frank about Jack Bailey, and if the day after the fire he\r\nhad told me what he suspected, there would have been no harrowing\r\nperiod for all of us, with the boy in danger.  But young people refuse\r\nto profit by the experience of their elders, and sometimes the elders\r\nare the ones to suffer.\r\n\r\nI was much used up the day after the fire, and Gertrude insisted on my\r\ngoing out.  The machine was temporarily out of commission, and the\r\ncarriage horses had been sent to a farm for the summer. Gertrude\r\nfinally got a trap from the Casanova liveryman, and we went out.  Just\r\nas we turned from the drive into the road we passed a woman.  She had\r\nput down a small valise, and stood inspecting the house and grounds\r\nminutely.  I should hardly have noticed her, had it not been for the\r\nfact that she had been horribly disfigured by smallpox.\r\n\r\n\"Ugh!\" Gertrude said, when we had passed, \"what a face!  I shall dream\r\nof it to-night.  Get up, Flinders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Flinders?\" I asked.  \"Is that the horse's name?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is.\"  She flicked the horse's stubby mane with the whip.  \"He\r\ndidn't look like a livery horse, and the liveryman said he had bought\r\nhim from the Armstrongs when they purchased a couple of motors and cut\r\ndown the stable.  Nice Flinders--good old boy!\"\r\n\r\nFlinders was certainly not a common name for a horse, and yet the\r\nyoungster at Richfield had named his prancing, curly-haired little\r\nhorse Flinders!  It set me to thinking.\r\n\r\nAt my request Halsey had already sent word of the fire to the agent\r\nfrom whom we had secured the house.  Also, he had called Mr. Jamieson\r\nby telephone, and somewhat guardedly had told him of the previous\r\nnight's events.  Mr. Jamieson promised to come out that night, and to\r\nbring another man with him.  I did not consider it necessary to notify\r\nMrs. Armstrong, in the village. No doubt she knew of the fire, and in\r\nview of my refusal to give up the house, an interview would probably\r\nhave been unpleasant enough.  But as we passed Doctor Walker's white\r\nand green house I thought of something.\r\n\r\n\"Stop here, Gertrude,\" I said.  \"I am going to get out.\"\r\n\r\n\"To see Louise?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, I want to ask this young Walker something.\"\r\n\r\nShe was curious, I knew, but I did not wait to explain.  I went up the\r\nwalk to the house, where a brass sign at the side announced the office,\r\nand went in.  The reception-room was empty, but from the\r\nconsulting-room beyond came the sound of two voices, not very amicable.\r\n\r\n\"It is an outrageous figure,\" some one was storming.  Then the doctor's\r\nquiet tone, evidently not arguing, merely stating something.  But I had\r\nnot time to listen to some person probably disputing his bill, so I\r\ncoughed.  The voices ceased at once: a door closed somewhere, and the\r\ndoctor entered from the hall of the house.  He looked sufficiently\r\nsurprised at seeing me.\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon, Doctor,\" I said formally.  \"I shall not keep you from\r\nyour patient.  I wish merely to ask you a question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't you sit down?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will not be necessary.  Doctor, has any one come to you, either\r\nearly this morning or to-day, to have you treat a bullet wound?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing so startling has happened to me,\" he said.  \"A bullet wound!\r\nThings must be lively at Sunnyside.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't say it was at Sunnyside.  But as it happens, it was. If any\r\nsuch case comes to you, will it be too much trouble for you to let me\r\nknow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be only too happy,\" he said.  \"I understand you have had a\r\nfire up there, too.  A fire and shooting in one night is rather lively\r\nfor a quiet place like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is as quiet as a boiler-shop,\" I replied, as I turned to go.\r\n\r\n\"And you are still going to stay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Until I am burned out,\" I responded.  And then on my way down the\r\nsteps, I turned around suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" I asked at a venture, \"have you ever heard of a child named\r\nLucien Wallace?\"\r\n\r\nClever as he was, his face changed and stiffened.  He was on his guard\r\nagain in a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Lucien Wallace?\" he repeated.  \"No, I think not.  There are plenty of\r\nWallaces around, but I don't know any Lucien.\"\r\n\r\nI was as certain as possible that he did.  People do not lie readily to\r\nme, and this man lied beyond a doubt.  But there was nothing to be\r\ngained now; his defenses were up, and I left, half irritated and wholly\r\nbaffled.\r\n\r\nOur reception was entirely different at Doctor Stewart's.  Taken into\r\nthe bosom of the family at once, Flinders tied outside and nibbling the\r\ngrass at the roadside, Gertrude and I drank some home-made elderberry\r\nwine and told briefly of the fire.  Of the more serious part of the\r\nnight's experience, of course, we said nothing.  But when at last we\r\nhad left the family on the porch and the good doctor was untying our\r\nsteed, I asked him the same question I had put to Doctor Walker.\r\n\r\n\"Shot!\" he said.  \"Bless my soul, no.  Why, what have you been doing up\r\nat the big house, Miss Innes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some one tried to enter the house during the fire, and was shot and\r\nslightly injured,\" I said hastily.  \"Please don't mention it; we wish\r\nto make as little of it as possible.\"\r\n\r\nThere was one other possibility, and we tried that.  At Casanova\r\nstation I saw the station master, and asked him if any trains left\r\nCasanova between one o'clock and daylight.  There was none until six\r\nA.M.  The next question required more diplomacy.\r\n\r\n\"Did you notice on the six-o'clock train any person--any man--who\r\nlimped a little?\" I asked.  \"Please try to remember: we are trying to\r\ntrace a man who was seen loitering around Sunnyside last night before\r\nthe fire.\"\r\n\r\nHe was all attention in a moment.\r\n\r\n\"I was up there myself at the fire,\" he said volubly.  \"I'm a member of\r\nthe volunteer company.  First big fire we've had since the summer house\r\nburned over to the club golf links.  My wife was sayin' the other day,\r\n'Dave, you might as well 'a' saved the money in that there helmet and\r\nshirt.'  And here last night they came in handy.  Rang that bell so\r\nhard I hadn't time scarcely to get 'em on.\"\r\n\r\n\"And--did you see a man who limped?\" Gertrude put in, as he stopped for\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n\"Not at the train, ma'm,\" he said.  \"No such person got on here to-day.\r\nBut I'll tell you where I did see a man that limped.  I didn't wait\r\ntill the fire company left; there's a fast freight goes through at four\r\nforty-five, and I had to get down to the station.  I seen there wasn't\r\nmuch more to do anyhow at the fire--we'd got the flames under\r\ncontrol\"--Gertrude looked at me and smiled--\"so I started down the\r\nhill.  There was folks here and there goin' home, and along by the path\r\nto the Country Club I seen two men.  One was a short fellow.  He was\r\nsitting on a big rock, his back to me, and he had something white in\r\nhis hand, as if he was tying up his foot.  After I'd gone on a piece I\r\nlooked back, and he was hobbling on and--excuse me, miss--he was\r\nswearing something sickening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did they go toward the club?\" Gertrude asked suddenly, leaning forward.\r\n\r\n\"No, miss.  I think they came into the village.  I didn't get a look at\r\ntheir faces, but I know every chick and child in the place, and\r\neverybody knows me.  When they didn't shout at me--in my uniform, you\r\nknow--I took it they were strangers.\"\r\n\r\nSo all we had for our afternoon's work was this: some one had been shot\r\nby the bullet that went through the door; he had not left the village,\r\nand he had not called in a physician.  Also, Doctor Walker knew who\r\nLucien Wallace was, and his very denial made me confident that, in that\r\none direction at least, we were on the right track.\r\n\r\nThe thought that the detective would be there that night was the most\r\ncheering thing of all, and I think even Gertrude was glad of it.\r\nDriving home that afternoon, I saw her in the clear sunlight for the\r\nfirst time in several days, and I was startled to see how ill she\r\nlooked.  She was thin and colorless, and all her bright animation was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n\"Gertrude,\" I said, \"I have been a very selfish old woman.  You are\r\ngoing to leave this miserable house to-night.  Annie Morton is going to\r\nScotland next week, and you shall go right with her.\"\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, she flushed painfully.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to go, Aunt Ray,\" she said.  \"Don't make me leave now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are losing your health and your good looks,\" I said decidedly.\r\n\"You should have a change.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shan't stir a foot.\"  She was equally decided.  Then, more lightly:\r\n\"Why, you and Liddy need me to arbitrate between you every day in the\r\nweek.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps I was growing suspicious of every one, but it seemed to me that\r\nGertrude's gaiety was forced and artificial.  I watched her covertly\r\nduring the rest of the drive, and I did not like the two spots of\r\ncrimson in her pale cheeks.  But I said nothing more about sending her\r\nto Scotland: I knew she would not go.\r\n\nThat day was destined to be an eventful one, for when I entered the\r\nhouse and found Eliza ensconced in the upper hall on a chair, with Mary\r\nAnne doing her best to stifle her with household ammonia, and Liddy\r\nrubbing her wrists--whatever good that is supposed to do--I knew that\r\nthe ghost had been walking again, and this time in daylight.\r\n\r\nEliza was in a frenzy of fear.  She clutched at my sleeve when I went\r\nclose to her, and refused to let go until she had told her story.\r\nComing just after the fire, the household was demoralized, and it was\r\nno surprise to me to find Alex and the under-gardener struggling\r\ndown-stairs with a heavy trunk between them.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't want to do it, Miss Innes,\" Alex said.  \"But she was so\r\nexcited, I was afraid she would do as she said--drag it down herself,\r\nand scratch the staircase.\"\r\n\r\nI was trying to get my bonnet off and to keep the maids quiet at the\r\nsame time.  \"Now, Eliza, when you have washed your face and stopped\r\nbawling,\" I said, \"come into my sitting-room and tell me what has\r\nhappened.\"\r\n\r\nLiddy put away my things without speaking.  The very set of her\r\nshoulders expressed disapproval.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I said, when the silence became uncomfortable, \"things seem to\r\nbe warming up.\"\r\n\r\nSilence from Liddy, and a long sigh.\r\n\r\n\"If Eliza goes, I don't know where to look for another cook.\" More\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"Rosie is probably a good cook.\"  Sniff.\r\n\r\n\"Liddy,\" I said at last, \"don't dare to deny that you are having the\r\ntime of your life.  You positively gloat in this excitement. You never\r\nlooked better.  It's my opinion all this running around, and getting\r\njolted out of a rut, has stirred up that torpid liver of yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not myself I'm thinking about,\" she said, goaded into speech.\r\n\"Maybe my liver was torpid, and maybe it wasn't; but I know this: I've\r\ngot some feelings left, and to see you standing at the foot of that\r\nstaircase shootin' through the door--I'll never be the same woman\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm glad of that--anything for a change,\" I said.  And in came\r\nEliza, flanked by Rosie and Mary Anne.\r\n\r\nHer story, broken with sobs and corrections from the other two, was\r\nthis:  At two o'clock (two-fifteen, Rosie insisted) she had gone\r\nup-stairs to get a picture from her room to show Mary Anne. (A picture\r\nof a LADY, Mary Anne interposed.)  She went up the servants' staircase\r\nand along the corridor to her room, which lay between the trunk-room\r\nand the unfinished ball-room.  She heard a sound as she went down the\r\ncorridor, like some one moving furniture, but she was not nervous.  She\r\nthought it might be men examining the house after the fire the night\r\nbefore, but she looked in the trunk-room and saw nobody.\r\n\r\nShe went into her room quietly.  The noise had ceased, and everything\r\nwas quiet.  Then she sat down on the side of her bed, and, feeling\r\nfaint--she was subject to spells--(\"I told you that when I came, didn't\r\nI, Rosie?\"  \"Yes'm, indeed she did!\")--she put her head down on her\r\npillow and--\r\n\r\n\"Took a nap.  All right!\" I said.  \"Go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I came to, Miss Innes, sure as I'm sittin' here, I thought I'd\r\ndie.  Somethin' hit me on the face, and I set up, sudden. And then I\r\nseen the plaster drop, droppin' from a little hole in the wall.  And\r\nthe first thing I knew, an iron bar that long\" (fully two yards by her\r\nmeasure) \"shot through that hole and tumbled on the bed.  If I'd been\r\nstill sleeping\"  (\"Fainting,\" corrected Rosie) \"I'd 'a' been hit on the\r\nhead and killed!\"\r\n\r\n\"I wisht you'd heard her scream,\" put in Mary Anne.  \"And her face as\r\nwhite as a pillow-slip when she tumbled down the stairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt there is some natural explanation for it, Eliza,\" I said.\r\n\"You may have dreamed it, in your 'fainting' attack.  But if it is\r\ntrue, the metal rod and the hole in the wall will show it.\"\r\n\r\nEliza looked a little bit sheepish.\r\n\r\n\"The hole's there all right, Miss Innes,\" she said.  \"But the bar was\r\ngone when Mary Anne and Rosie went up to pack my trunk.\"\r\n\r\n\"That wasn't all,\" Liddy's voice came funereally from a corner. \"Eliza\r\nsaid that from the hole in the wall a burning eye looked down at her!\"\r\n\r\n\"The wall must be at least six inches thick,\" I said with asperity.\r\n\"Unless the person who drilled the hole carried his eyes on the ends of\r\na stick, Eliza couldn't possibly have seen them.\"\r\n\r\nBut the fact remained, and a visit to Eliza's room proved it.  I might\r\njeer all I wished: some one had drilled a hole in the unfinished wall\r\nof the ball-room, passing between the bricks of the partition, and\r\nshooting through the unresisting plaster of Eliza's room with such\r\nforce as to send the rod flying on to her bed.  I had gone up-stairs\r\nalone, and I confess the thing puzzled me: in two or three places in\r\nthe wall small apertures had been made, none of them of any depth.  Not\r\nthe least mysterious thing was the disappearance of the iron implement\r\nthat had been used.\r\n\r\nI remembered a story I read once about an impish dwarf that lived in\r\nthe spaces between the double walls of an ancient castle.  I wondered\r\nvaguely if my original idea of a secret entrance to a hidden chamber\r\ncould be right, after all, and if we were housing some erratic guest,\r\nwho played pranks on us in the dark, and destroyed the walls that he\r\nmight listen, hidden safely away, to our amazed investigations.\r\n\r\nMary Anne and Eliza left that afternoon, but Rosie decided to stay.  It\r\nwas about five o'clock when the hack came from the station to get them,\r\nand, to my amazement, it had an occupant. Matthew Geist, the driver,\r\nasked for me, and explained his errand with pride.\r\n\r\n\"I've brought you a cook, Miss Innes,\" he said.  \"When the message came\r\nto come up for two girls and their trunks, I supposed there was\r\nsomething doing, and as this here woman had been looking for work in\r\nthe village, I thought I'd bring her along.\"\r\n\r\nAlready I had acquired the true suburbanite ability to take servants on\r\nfaith; I no longer demanded written and unimpeachable references.  I,\r\nRachel Innes, have learned not to mind if the cook sits down\r\ncomfortably in my sitting-room when she is taking the orders for the\r\nday, and I am grateful if the silver is not cleaned with scouring soap.\r\nAnd so that day I merely told Liddy to send the new applicant in.  When\r\nshe came, however, I could hardly restrain a gasp of surprise.  It was\r\nthe woman with the pitted face.\r\n\r\nShe stood somewhat awkwardly just inside the door, and she had an air\r\nof self-confidence that was inspiring.  Yes, she could cook; was not a\r\nfancy cook, but could make good soups and desserts if there was any one\r\nto take charge of the salads.  And so, in the end, I took her.  As\r\nHalsey said, when we told him, it didn't matter much about the cook's\r\nface, if it was clean.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of Halsey's restlessness.  On that day it seemed to be\r\nmore than ever a resistless impulse that kept him out until after\r\nluncheon.  I think he hoped constantly that he might meet Louise\r\ndriving over the hills in her runabout: possibly he did meet her\r\noccasionally, but from his continued gloom I felt sure the situation\r\nbetween them was unchanged.\r\n\r\nPart of the afternoon I believe he read--Gertrude and I were out, as I\r\nhave said, and at dinner we both noticed that something had occurred to\r\ndistract him.  He was disagreeable, which is unlike him, nervous,\r\nlooking at his watch every few minutes, and he ate almost nothing.  He\r\nasked twice during the meal on what train Mr. Jamieson and the other\r\ndetective were coming, and had long periods of abstraction during which\r\nhe dug his fork into my damask cloth and did not hear when he was\r\nspoken to.  He refused dessert, and left the table early, excusing\r\nhimself on the ground that he wanted to see Alex.\r\n\r\nAlex, however, was not to be found.  It was after eight when Halsey\r\nordered the car, and started down the hill at a pace that, even for\r\nhim, was unusually reckless.  Shortly after, Alex reported that he was\r\nready to go over the house, preparatory to closing it for the night.\r\nSam Bohannon came at a quarter before nine, and began his patrol of the\r\ngrounds, and with the arrival of the two detectives to look forward to,\r\nI was not especially apprehensive.\r\n\r\nAt half-past nine I heard the sound of a horse driven furiously up the\r\ndrive.  It came to a stop in front of the house, and immediately after\r\nthere were hurried steps on the veranda.  Our nerves were not what they\r\nshould have been, and Gertrude, always apprehensive lately, was at the\r\ndoor almost instantly.  A moment later Louise had burst into the room\r\nand stood there bareheaded and breathing hard!\r\n\r\n\"Where is Halsey?\" she demanded.  Above her plain black gown her eyes\r\nlooked big and somber, and the rapid drive had brought no color to her\r\nface.  I got up and drew forward a chair.\r\n\r\n\"He has not come back,\" I said quietly.  \"Sit down, child; you are not\r\nstrong enough for this kind of thing.\"\r\n\r\nI don't think she even heard me.\r\n\r\n\"He has not come back?\" she asked, looking from me to Gertrude. \"Do you\r\nknow where he went?  Where can I find him?\"\r\n\r\n\"For Heaven's sake, Louise,\" Gertrude burst out, \"tell us what is\r\nwrong.  Halsey is not here.  He has gone to the station for Mr.\r\nJamieson.  What has happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"To the station, Gertrude?  You are sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said.  \"Listen.  There is the whistle of the train now.\"\r\n\r\nShe relaxed a little at our matter-of-fact tone, and allowed herself to\r\nsink into a chair.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I was wrong,\" she said heavily.  \"He--will be here in a few\r\nmoments if--everything is right.\"\r\n\r\nWe sat there, the three of us, without attempt at conversation. Both\r\nGertrude and I recognized the futility of asking Louise any questions:\r\nher reticence was a part of a role she had assumed. Our ears were\r\nstrained for the first throb of the motor as it turned into the drive\r\nand commenced the climb to the house.  Ten minutes passed, fifteen,\r\ntwenty.  I saw Louise's hands grow rigid as they clutched the arms of\r\nher chair.  I watched Gertrude's bright color slowly ebbing away, and\r\naround my own heart I seemed to feel the grasp of a giant hand.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five minutes, and then a sound.  But it was not the chug of the\r\nmotor: it was the unmistakable rumble of the Casanova hack.  Gertrude\r\ndrew aside the curtain and peered into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"It's the hack, I am sure,\" she said, evidently relieved. \"Something\r\nhas gone wrong with the car, and no wonder--the way Halsey went down\r\nthe hill.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed a long time before the creaking vehicle came to a stop at the\r\ndoor.  Louise rose and stood watching, her hand to her throat.  And\r\nthen Gertrude opened the door, admitting Mr. Jamieson and a stocky,\r\nmiddle-aged man.  Halsey was not with them.  When the door had closed\r\nand Louise realized that Halsey had not come, her expression changed.\r\nFrom tense watchfulness to relief, and now again to absolute despair,\r\nher face was an open page.\r\n\r\n\"Halsey?\" I asked unceremoniously, ignoring the stranger.  \"Did he not\r\nmeet you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"  Mr. Jamieson looked slightly surprised.  \"I rather expected the\r\ncar, but we got up all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't see him at all?\" Louise demanded breathlessly.\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson knew her at once, although he had not seen her before.\r\nShe had kept to her rooms until the morning she left.\r\n\r\n\"No, Miss Armstrong,\" he said.  \"I saw nothing of him.  What is wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we shall have to find him,\" she asserted.  \"Every instant is\r\nprecious.  Mr. Jamieson, I have reason for believing that he is in\r\ndanger, but I don't know what it is.  Only--he must be found.\"\r\n\r\nThe stocky man had said nothing.  Now, however, he went quickly toward\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\"I'll catch the hack down the road and hold it,\" he said.  \"Is the\r\ngentleman down in the town?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Jamieson,\" Louise said impulsively, \"I can use the hack. Take my\r\nhorse and trap outside and drive like mad.  Try to find the Dragon\r\nFly--it ought to be easy to trace.  I can think of no other way.  Only,\r\ndon't lose a moment.\"\r\n\r\nThe new detective had gone, and a moment later Jamieson went rapidly\r\ndown the drive, the cob's feet striking fire at every step.  Louise\r\nstood looking after them.  When she turned around she faced Gertrude,\r\nwho stood indignant, almost tragic, in the hall.\r\n\r\n\"You KNOW what threatens Halsey, Louise,\" she said accusingly.  \"I\r\nbelieve you know this whole horrible thing, this mystery that we are\r\nstruggling with.  If anything happens to Halsey, I shall never forgive\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nLouise only raised her hands despairingly and dropped them again.\r\n\r\n\"He is as dear to me as he is to you,\" she said sadly.  \"I tried to\r\nwarn him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" I said, as briskly as I could.  \"We are making a lot of\r\ntrouble out of something perhaps very small.  Halsey was probably\r\nlate--he is always late.  Any moment we may hear the car coming up the\r\nroad.\"\r\n\r\nBut it did not come.  After a half-hour of suspense, Louise went out\r\nquietly, and did not come back.  I hardly knew she was gone until I\r\nheard the station hack moving off.  At eleven o'clock the telephone\r\nrang.  It was Mr. Jamieson.\r\n\r\n\"I have found the Dragon Fly, Miss Innes,\" he said.  \"It has collided\r\nwith a freight car on the siding above the station.  No, Mr. Innes was\r\nnot there, but we shall probably find him.  Send Warner for the car.\"\r\n\r\nBut they did not find him.  At four o'clock the next morning we were\r\nstill waiting for news, while Alex watched the house and Sam the\r\ngrounds.  At daylight I dropped into exhausted sleep. Halsey had not\r\ncome back, and there was no word from the detective.\r\n\nNothing that had gone before had been as bad as this.  The murder and\r\nThomas' sudden death we had been able to view in a detached sort of\r\nway.  But with Halsey's disappearance everything was altered.  Our\r\nlittle circle, intact until now, was broken.  We were no longer\r\nonlookers who saw a battle passing around them. We were the center of\r\naction.  Of course, there was no time then to voice such an idea.  My\r\nmind seemed able to hold only one thought: that Halsey had been foully\r\ndealt with, and that every minute lost might be fatal.\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson came back about eight o'clock the next morning: he was\r\ncovered with mud, and his hat was gone.  Altogether, we were a\r\nsad-looking trio that gathered around a breakfast that no one could\r\neat.  Over a cup of black coffee the detective told us what he had\r\nlearned of Halsey's movements the night before. Up to a certain point\r\nthe car had made it easy enough to follow him.  And I gathered that Mr.\r\nBurns, the other detective, had followed a similar car for miles at\r\ndawn, only to find it was a touring car on an endurance run.\r\n\r\n\"He left here about ten minutes after eight,\" Mr. Jamieson said. \"He\r\nwent alone, and at eight twenty he stopped at Doctor Walker's.  I went\r\nto the doctor's about midnight, but he had been called out on a case,\r\nand had not come back at four o'clock. From the doctor's it seems Mr.\r\nInnes walked across the lawn to the cottage Mrs. Armstrong and her\r\ndaughter have taken.  Mrs. Armstrong had retired, and he said perhaps a\r\ndozen words to Miss Louise.  She will not say what they were, but the\r\ngirl evidently suspects what has occurred.  That is, she suspects foul\r\nplay, but she doesn't know of what nature.  Then, apparently, he\r\nstarted directly for the station.  He was going very fast--the flagman\r\nat the Carol Street crossing says he saw the car pass.  He knew the\r\nsiren.  Along somewhere in the dark stretch between Carol Street and\r\nthe depot he evidently swerved suddenly--perhaps some one in the\r\nroad--and went full into the side of a freight.  We found it there last\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"He might have been thrown under the train by the force of the shock,\"\r\nI said tremulously.\r\n\r\nGertrude shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"We examined every inch of track.  There was--no sign.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely--he can't be--gone!\" I cried.  \"Aren't there traces in the\r\nmud--anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no mud--only dust.  There has been no rain.  And the footpath\r\nthere is of cinders.  Miss Innes, I am inclined to think that he has\r\nmet with bad treatment, in the light of what has gone before.  I do not\r\nthink he has been murdered.\"  I shrank from the word.  \"Burns is back\r\nin the country, on a clue we got from the night clerk at the\r\ndrug-store.  There will be two more men here by noon, and the city\r\noffice is on the lookout.\"\r\n\r\n\"The creek?\" Gertrude asked.\r\n\r\n\"The creek is shallow now.  If it were swollen with rain, it would be\r\ndifferent.  There is hardly any water in it.  Now, Miss Innes,\" he\r\nsaid, turning to me, \"I must ask you some questions. Had Mr. Halsey any\r\npossible reason for going away like this, without warning?\"\r\n\r\n\"None whatever.\"\r\n\r\n\"He went away once before,\" he persisted.  \"And you were as sure then.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did not leave the Dragon Fly jammed into the side of a freight car\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but he left it for repairs in a blacksmith shop, a long distance\r\nfrom here.  Do you know if he had any enemies?  Any one who might wish\r\nhim out of the way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not that I know of, unless--no, I can not think of any.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was he in the habit of carrying money?\"\r\n\r\n\"He never carried it far.  No, he never had more than enough for\r\ncurrent expenses.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson got up then and began to pace the room.  It was an\r\nunwonted concession to the occasion.\r\n\r\n\"Then I think we get at it by elimination.  The chances are against\r\nflight.  If he was hurt, we find no trace of him.  It looks almost like\r\nan abduction.  This young Doctor Walker--have you any idea why Mr.\r\nInnes should have gone there last night?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can not understand it,\" Gertrude said thoughtfully.  \"I don't think\r\nhe knew Doctor Walker at all, and--their relations could hardly have\r\nbeen cordial, under the circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nJamieson pricked up his ears, and little by little he drew from us the\r\nunfortunate story of Halsey's love affair, and the fact that Louise was\r\ngoing to marry Doctor Walker.\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson listened attentively.\r\n\r\n\"There are some interesting developments here,\" he said thoughtfully.\r\n\"The woman who claims to be the mother of Lucien Wallace has not come\r\nback.  Your nephew has apparently been spirited away.  There is an\r\norganized attempt being made to enter this house; in fact, it has been\r\nentered.  Witness the incident with the cook yesterday.  And I have a\r\nnew piece of information.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked carefully away from Gertrude.  \"Mr. John Bailey is not at his\r\nKnickerbocker apartments, and I don't know where he is. It's a hash,\r\nthat's what it is.  It's a Chinese puzzle.  They won't fit together,\r\nunless--unless Mr. Bailey and your nephew have again--\"\r\n\r\nAnd once again Gertrude surprised me.  \"They are not together,\" she\r\nsaid hotly.  \"I--know where Mr. Bailey is, and my brother is not with\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nThe detective turned and looked at her keenly.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Gertrude,\" he said, \"if you and Miss Louise would only tell me\r\neverything you know and surmise about this business, I should be able\r\nto do a great many things.  I believe I could find your brother, and I\r\nmight be able to--well, to do some other things.\"  But Gertrude's\r\nglance did not falter.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing that I know could help you to find Halsey,\" she said\r\nstubbornly.  \"I know absolutely as little of his disappearance as you\r\ndo, and I can only say this: I do not trust Doctor Walker.  I think he\r\nhated Halsey, and he would get rid of him if he could.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you are right.  In fact, I had some such theory myself. But\r\nDoctor Walker went out late last night to a serious case in\r\nSummitville, and is still there.  Burns traced him there.  We have made\r\nguarded inquiry at the Greenwood Club, and through the village.  There\r\nis absolutely nothing to go on but this.  On the embankment above the\r\nrailroad, at the point where we found the machine, is a small house.\r\nAn old woman and a daughter, who is very lame, live there.  They say\r\nthat they distinctly heard the shock when the Dragon Fly hit the car,\r\nand they went to the bottom of their garden and looked over.  The\r\nautomobile was there; they could see the lights, and they thought\r\nsomeone had been injured.  It was very dark, but they could make out\r\ntwo figures, standing together.  The women were curious, and, leaving\r\nthe fence, they went back and by a roundabout path down to the road.\r\nWhen they got there the car was still standing, the headlight broken\r\nand the bonnet crushed, but there was no one to be seen.\"\r\n\r\nThe detective went away immediately, and to Gertrude and me was left\r\nthe woman's part, to watch and wait.  By luncheon nothing had been\r\nfound, and I was frantic.  I went up-stairs to Halsey's room finally,\r\nfrom sheer inability to sit across from Gertrude any longer, and meet\r\nher terror-filled eyes.\r\n\r\nLiddy was in my dressing-room, suspiciously red-eyed, and trying to put\r\na right sleeve in a left armhole of a new waist for me.  I was too much\r\nshaken to scold.\r\n\r\n\"What name did that woman in the kitchen give?\" she demanded, viciously\r\nripping out the offending sleeve.\r\n\r\n\"Bliss.  Mattie Bliss,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Bliss.  M. B.  Well, that's not what she has on he suitcase.  It is\r\nmarked N. F. C.\"\r\n\r\nThe new cook and her initials troubled me not at all.  I put on my\r\nbonnet and sent for what the Casanova liveryman called a \"stylish\r\nturnout.\"  Having once made up my mind to a course of action, I am not\r\none to turn back.  Warner drove me; he was plainly disgusted, and he\r\nsteered the livery horse as he would the Dragon Fly, feeling uneasily\r\nwith his left foot for the clutch, and working his right elbow at an\r\nimaginary horn every time a dog got in the way.\r\n\r\nWarner had something on his mind, and after we had turned into the\r\nroad, he voiced it.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Innes,\" he said.  \"I overheard a part of a conversation yesterday\r\nthat I didn't understand.  It wasn't my business to understand it, for\r\nthat matter.  But I've been thinking all day that I'd better tell you.\r\nYesterday afternoon, while you and Miss Gertrude were out driving, I\r\nhad got the car in some sort of shape again after the fire, and I went\r\nto the library to call Mr. Innes to see it.  I went into the\r\nliving-room, where Miss Liddy said he was, and half-way across to the\r\nlibrary I heard him talking to some one.  He seemed to be walking up\r\nand down, and he was in a rage, I can tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he say?\"\r\n\r\n\"The first thing I heard was--excuse me, Miss Innes, but it's what he\r\nsaid, 'The damned rascal,' he said, 'I'll see him in'--well, in hell\r\nwas what he said, 'in hell first.'  Then somebody else spoke up; it was\r\na woman.  She said, 'I warned them, but they thought I would be\r\nafraid.'\"\r\n\r\n\"A woman!  Did you wait to see who it was?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't spying, Miss Innes,\" Warner said with dignity.  \"But the next\r\nthing caught my attention.  She said, 'I knew there was something wrong\r\nfrom the start.  A man isn't well one day, and dead the next, without\r\nsome reason.'  I thought she was speaking of Thomas.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you don't know who it was!\" I exclaimed.  \"Warner, you had the key\r\nto this whole occurrence in your hands, and did not use it!\"\r\n\r\nHowever, there was nothing to be done.  I resolved to make inquiry when\r\nI got home, and in the meantime, my present errand absorbed me.  This\r\nwas nothing less than to see Louise Armstrong, and to attempt to drag\r\nfrom her what she knew, or suspected, of Halsey's disappearance.  But\r\nhere, as in every direction I turned, I was baffled.\r\n\r\nA neat maid answered the bell, but she stood squarely in the doorway,\r\nand it was impossible to preserve one's dignity and pass her.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Armstrong is very ill, and unable to see any one,\" she said.  I\r\ndid not believe her.\r\n\r\n\"And Mrs. Armstrong--is she also ill?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is with Miss Louise and can not be disturbed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell her it is Miss Innes, and that it is a matter of the greatest\r\nimportance.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be of no use, Miss Innes.  My orders are positive.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment a heavy step sounded on the stairs.  Past the maid's\r\nwhite-strapped shoulder I could see a familiar thatch of gray hair, and\r\nin a moment I was face to face with Doctor Stewart.  He was very grave,\r\nand his customary geniality was tinged with restraint.\r\n\r\n\"You are the very woman I want to see,\" he said promptly.  \"Send away\r\nyour trap, and let me drive you home.  What is this about your nephew?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has disappeared, doctor.  Not only that, but there is every\r\nevidence that he has been either abducted, or--\" I could not finish.\r\nThe doctor helped me into his capacious buggy in silence.  Until we had\r\ngot a little distance he did not speak; then he turned and looked at me.\r\n\r\n\"Now tell me about it,\" he said.  He heard me through without speaking.\r\n\r\n\"And you think Louise knows something?\" he said when I had finished.\r\n\"I don't--in fact, I am sure of it.  The best evidence of it is this:\r\nshe asked me if he had been heard from, or if anything had been\r\nlearned.  She won't allow Walker in the room, and she made me promise\r\nto see you and tell you this: don't give up the search for him.  Find\r\nhim, and find him soon.  He is living.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I said, \"if she knows that, she knows more.  She is a very\r\ncruel and ungrateful girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is a very sick girl,\" he said gravely.  \"Neither you nor I can\r\njudge her until we know everything.  Both she and her mother are ghosts\r\nof their former selves.  Under all this, these two sudden deaths, this\r\nbank robbery, the invasions at Sunnyside and Halsey's disappearance,\r\nthere is some mystery that, mark my words, will come out some day.  And\r\nwhen it does, we shall find Louise Armstrong a victim.\"\r\n\r\nI had not noticed where we were going, but now I saw we were beside the\r\nrailroad, and from a knot of men standing beside the track I divined\r\nthat it was here the car had been found.  The siding, however, was\r\nempty.  Except a few bits of splintered wood on the ground, there was\r\nno sign of the accident.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the freight car that was rammed?\" the doctor asked a\r\nbystander.\r\n\r\n\"It was taken away at daylight, when the train was moved.\"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to be gained.  He pointed out the house on the\r\nembankment where the old lady and her daughter had heard the crash and\r\nseen two figures beside the car.  Then we drove slowly home.  I had the\r\ndoctor put me down at the gate, and I walked to the house--past the\r\nlodge where we had found Louise, and, later, poor Thomas; up the drive\r\nwhere I had seen a man watching the lodge and where, later, Rosie had\r\nbeen frightened; past the east entrance, where so short a time before\r\nthe most obstinate effort had been made to enter the house, and where,\r\nthat night two weeks ago, Liddy and I had seen the strange woman.  Not\r\nfar from the west wing lay the blackened ruins of the stables.  I felt\r\nlike a ruin myself, as I paused on the broad veranda before I entered\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nTwo private detectives had arrived in my absence, and it was a relief\r\nto turn over to them the responsibility of the house and grounds.  Mr.\r\nJamieson, they said, had arranged for more to assist in the search for\r\nthe missing man, and at that time the country was being scoured in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nThe household staff was again depleted that afternoon.  Liddy was\r\nwaiting to tell me that the new cook had gone, bag and baggage, without\r\nwaiting to be paid.  No one had admitted the visitor whom Warner had\r\nheard in the library, unless, possibly, the missing cook.  Again I was\r\nworking in a circle.\r\n\nThe four days, from Saturday to the following Tuesday, we lived, or\r\nexisted, in a state of the most dreadful suspense.  We ate only when\r\nLiddy brought in a tray, and then very little.  The papers, of course,\r\nhad got hold of the story, and we were besieged by newspaper men.  From\r\nall over the country false clues came pouring in and raised hopes that\r\ncrumbled again to nothing. Every morgue within a hundred miles, every\r\nhospital, had been visited, without result.\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson, personally, took charge of the organized search, and\r\nevery evening, no matter where he happened to be, he called us by long\r\ndistance telephone.  It was the same formula. \"Nothing to-day.  A new\r\nclue to work on.  Better luck to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nAnd heartsick we would put up the receiver and sit down again to our\r\nvigil.\r\n\r\nThe inaction was deadly.  Liddy cried all day, and, because she knew I\r\nobjected to tears, sniffled audibly around the corner.\r\n\r\n\"For Heaven's sake, smile!\" I snapped at her.  And her ghastly attempt\r\nat a grin, with her swollen nose and red eyes, made me hysterical.  I\r\nlaughed and cried together, and pretty soon, like the two old fools we\r\nwere, we were sitting together weeping into the same handkerchief.\r\n\r\nThings were happening, of course, all the time, but they made little or\r\nno impression.  The Charity Hospital called up Doctor Stewart and\r\nreported that Mrs. Watson was in a critical condition.  I understood\r\nalso that legal steps were being taken to terminate my lease at\r\nSunnyside.  Louise was out of danger, but very ill, and a trained nurse\r\nguarded her like a gorgon. There was a rumor in the village, brought up\r\nby Liddy from the butcher's, that a wedding had already taken place\r\nbetween Louise and Doctor Walkers and this roused me for the first time\r\nto action.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, then, I sent for the car, and prepared to go out.  As I\r\nwaited at the porte-cochere I saw the under-gardener, an inoffensive,\r\ngrayish-haired man, trimming borders near the house.\r\n\r\nThe day detective was watching him, sitting on the carriage block.\r\nWhen he saw me, he got up.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Innes,\" he said, taking of his hat, \"do you know where Alex, the\r\ngardener, is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, no.  Isn't he here?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"He has been gone since yesterday afternoon.  Have you employed him\r\nlong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only a couple of weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he efficient?  A capable man?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hardly know,\" I said vaguely.  \"The place looks all right, and I\r\nknow very little about such things.  I know much more about boxes of\r\nroses than bushes of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"This man,\" pointing to the assistant, \"says Alex isn't a gardener.\r\nThat he doesn't know anything about plants.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's very strange,\" I said, thinking hard.  \"Why, he came to me from\r\nthe Brays, who are in Europe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\"  The detective smiled.  \"Every man who cuts grass isn't a\r\ngardener, Miss Innes, and just now it is our policy to believe every\r\nperson around here a rascal until he proves to be the other thing.\"\r\n\r\nWarner came up with the car then, and the conversation stopped.  As he\r\nhelped me in, however, the detective said something further.\r\n\r\n\"Not a word or sign to Alex, if he comes back,\" he said cautiously.\r\n\r\nI went first to Doctor Walker's.  I was tired of beating about the\r\nbush, and I felt that the key to Halsey's disappearance was here at\r\nCasanova, in spite of Mr. Jamieson's theories.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was in.  He came at once to the door of his consulting-room,\r\nand there was no mask of cordiality in his manner.\r\n\r\n\"Please come in,\" he said curtly.\r\n\r\n\"I shall stay here, I think, doctor.\"  I did not like his face or his\r\nmanner; there was a subtle change in both.  He had thrown off the air of\r\nfriendliness, and I thought, too, that he looked anxious and haggard.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor Walker,\" I said, \"I have come to you to ask some questions.  I\r\nhope you will answer them.  As you know, my nephew has not yet been\r\nfound.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I understand,\" stiffly.\r\n\r\n\"I believe, if you would, you could help us, and that leads to one of\r\nmy questions.  Will you tell me what was the nature of the conversation\r\nyou held with him the night he was attacked and carried off?\"\r\n\r\n\"Attacked!  Carried off!\" he said, with pretended surprise. \"Really,\r\nMiss Innes, don't you think you exaggerate?  I understand it is not the\r\nfirst time Mr. Innes has--disappeared.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are quibbling, doctor.  This is a matter of life and death. Will\r\nyou answer my question?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.  He said his nerves were bad, and I gave him a prescription\r\nfor them.  I am violating professional ethics when I tell you even as\r\nmuch as that.\"\r\n\r\nI could not tell him he lied.  I think I looked it.  But I hazarded a\r\nrandom shot.\r\n\r\n\"I thought perhaps,\" I said, watching him narrowly, \"that it might be\r\nabout--Nina Carrington.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment I thought he was going to strike me.  He grew livid, and a\r\nsmall crooked blood-vessel in his temple swelled and throbbed\r\ncuriously.  Then he forced a short laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Who is Nina Carrington?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I am about to discover that,\" I replied, and he was quiet at once.  It\r\nwas not difficult to divine that he feared Nina Carrington a good deal\r\nmore than he did the devil.  Our leave-taking was brief; in fact, we\r\nmerely stared at each other over the waiting-room table, with its\r\nlitter of year-old magazines.  Then I turned and went out.\r\n\r\n\"To Richfield,\" I told Warner, and on the way I thought, and thought\r\nhard.\r\n\r\n\"Nina Carrington, Nina Carrington,\" the roar and rush of the wheels\r\nseemed to sing the words.  \"Nina Carrington, N. C.\"  And I then knew,\r\nknew as surely as if I had seen the whole thing. There had been an N.\r\nC. on the suit-case belonging to the woman with the pitted face.  How\r\nsimple it all seemed.  Mattie Bliss had been Nina Carrington.  It was\r\nshe Warner had heard in the library.  It was something she had told\r\nHalsey that had taken him frantically to Doctor Walker's office, and\r\nfrom there perhaps to his death.  If we could find the woman, we might\r\nfind what had become of Halsey.\r\n\r\nWe were almost at Richfield now, so I kept on.  My mind was not on my\r\nerrand there now.  It was back with Halsey on that memorable night.\r\nWhat was it he had said to Louise, that had sent her up to Sunnyside,\r\nhalf wild with fear for him?  I made up my mind, as the car drew up\r\nbefore the Tate cottage, that I would see Louise if I had to break into\r\nthe house at night.\r\n\r\nAlmost exactly the same scene as before greeted my eyes at the cottage.\r\nMrs. Tate, the baby-carriage in the path, the children at the\r\nswing--all were the same.\r\n\r\nShe came forward to meet me, and I noticed that some of the anxious\r\nlines had gone out of her face.  She looked young, almost pretty.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you have come back,\" she said.  \"I think I will have to be\r\nhonest and give you back your money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" I asked.  \"Has the mother come?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but some one came and paid the boy's board for a month.  She\r\ntalked to him for a long time, but when I asked him afterward he didn't\r\nknow her name.\"\r\n\r\n\"A young woman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very young.  About forty, I suppose.  She was small and\r\nfair-haired, just a little bit gray, and very sad.  She was in deep\r\nmourning, and, I think, when she came, she expected to go at once.  But\r\nthe child, Lucien, interested her.  She talked to him for a long time,\r\nand, indeed, she looked much happier when she left.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are sure this was not the real mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"O mercy, no!  Why, she didn't know which of the three was Lucien.  I\r\nthought perhaps she was a friend of yours, but, of course, I didn't\r\nask.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was not--pock-marked?\" I asked at a venture.  \"No, indeed. A skin\r\nlike a baby's.  But perhaps you will know the initials. She gave Lucien\r\na handkerchief and forgot it.  It was very fine, black-bordered, and it\r\nhad three hand-worked letters in the corner--F. B. A.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said with truth enough, \"she is not a friend of mine.\" F. B. A.\r\nwas Fanny Armstrong, without a chance of doubt!\r\n\r\nWith another warning to Mrs. Tate as to silence, we started back to\r\nSunnyside.  So Fanny Armstrong knew of Lucien Wallace, and was\r\nsufficiently interested to visit him and pay for his support. Who was\r\nthe child's mother and where was she?  Who was Nina Carrington?  Did\r\neither of them know where Halsey was or what had happened to him?\r\n\r\nOn the way home we passed the little cemetery where Thomas had been\r\nlaid to rest.  I wondered if Thomas could have helped us to find\r\nHalsey, had he lived.  Farther along was the more imposing\r\nburial-ground, where Arnold Armstrong and his father lay in the shadow\r\nof a tall granite shaft.  Of the three, I think Thomas was the only one\r\nsincerely mourned.\r\n\nThe bitterness toward the dead president of the Traders' Bank seemed to\r\ngrow with time.  Never popular, his memory was execrated by people who\r\nhad lost nothing, but who were filled with disgust by constantly\r\nhearing new stories of the man's grasping avarice.  The Traders' had\r\nbeen a favorite bank for small tradespeople, and in its savings\r\ndepartment it had solicited the smallest deposits.  People who had\r\nthought to be self-supporting to the last found themselves confronting\r\nthe poorhouse, their two or three hundred dollar savings wiped away.\r\nAll bank failures have this element, however, and the directors were\r\ntrying to promise twenty per cent. on deposits.\r\n\r\nBut, like everything else those days, the bank failure was almost\r\nforgotten by Gertrude and myself.  We did not mention Jack Bailey: I\r\nhad found nothing to change my impression of his guilt, and Gertrude\r\nknew how I felt.  As for the murder of the bank president's son, I was\r\nof two minds.  One day I thought Gertrude knew or at least suspected\r\nthat Jack had done it; the next I feared that it had been Gertrude\r\nherself, that night alone on the circular staircase.  And then the\r\nmother of Lucien Wallace would obtrude herself, and an almost equally\r\ngood case might be made against her.  There were times, of course, when\r\nI was disposed to throw all those suspicions aside, and fix definitely\r\non the unknown, whoever that might be.\r\n\r\nI had my greatest disappointment when it came to tracing Nina\r\nCarrington.  The woman had gone without leaving a trace.  Marked as she\r\nwas, it should have been easy to follow her, but she was not to be\r\nfound.  A description to one of the detectives, on my arrival at home,\r\nhad started the ball rolling.  But by night she had not been found.  I\r\ntold Gertrude, then, about the telegram to Louise when she had been ill\r\nbefore; about my visit to Doctor Walker, and my suspicions that Mattie\r\nBliss and Nina Carrington were the same.  She thought, as I did, that\r\nthere was little doubt of it.\r\n\r\nI said nothing to her, however, of the detective's suspicions about\r\nAlex.  Little things that I had not noticed at the time now came back\r\nto me.  I had an uncomfortable feeling that perhaps Alex was a spy, and\r\nthat by taking him into the house I had played into the enemy's hand.\r\nBut at eight o'clock that night Alex himself appeared, and with him a\r\nstrange and repulsive individual.  They made a queer pair, for Alex was\r\nalmost as disreputable as the tramp, and he had a badly swollen eye.\r\n\r\nGertrude had been sitting listlessly waiting for the evening message\r\nfrom Mr. Jamieson, but when the singular pair came in, as they did,\r\nwithout ceremony, she jumped up and stood staring. Winters, the\r\ndetective who watched the house at night, followed them, and kept his\r\neyes sharply on Alex's prisoner.  For that was the situation as it\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall lanky individual, ragged and dirty, and just now he\r\nlooked both terrified and embarrassed.  Alex was too much engrossed to\r\nbe either, and to this day I don't think I ever asked him why he went\r\noff without permission the day before.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Innes,\" Alex began abruptly, \"this man can tell us something very\r\nimportant about the disappearance of Mr. Innes.  I found him trying to\r\nsell this watch.\"\r\n\r\nHe took a watch from his pocket and put it on the table.  It was\r\nHalsey's watch.  I had given it to him on his twenty-first birthday: I\r\nwas dumb with apprehension.\r\n\r\n\"He says he had a pair of cuff-links also, but he sold them--\"\r\n\r\n\"Fer a dollar'n half,\" put in the disreputable individual hoarsely,\r\nwith an eye on the detective.\r\n\r\n\"He is not--dead?\" I implored.  The tramp cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n\"No'm,\" he said huskily.  \"He was used up pretty bad, but he weren't\r\ndead.  He was comin' to hisself when I\"--he stopped and looked at the\r\ndetective.  \"I didn't steal it, Mr. Winters,\" he whined.  \"I found it\r\nin the road, honest to God, I did.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Winters paid no attention to him.  He was watching Alex.\r\n\r\n\"I'd better tell what he told me,\" Alex broke in.  \"It will be quicker.\r\nWhen Jamieson--when Mr. Jamieson calls up we can start him right.  Mr.\r\nWinters, I found this man trying to sell that watch on Fifth Street.\r\nHe offered it to me for three dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you know the watch?\" Winters snapped at him.\r\n\r\n\"I had seen it before, many times.  I used it at night when I was\r\nwatching at the foot of the staircase.\"  The detective was satisfied.\r\n\"When he offered the watch to me, I knew it, and I pretended I was\r\ngoing to buy it.  We went into an alley and I got the watch.\"  The\r\ntramp shivered.  It was plain how Alex had secured the watch.  \"Then--I\r\ngot the story from this fellow.  He claims to have seen the whole\r\naffair.  He says he was in an empty car--in the car the automobile\r\nstruck.\"\r\n\r\nThe tramp broke in here, and told his story, with frequent\r\ninterpretations by Alex and Mr. Winters.  He used a strange medley, in\r\nwhich familiar words took unfamiliar meanings, but it was gradually\r\nmade clear to us.\r\n\r\nOn the night in question the tramp had been \"pounding his ear\"--this\r\nstuck to me as being graphic--in an empty box-car along the siding at\r\nCasanova.  The train was going west, and due to leave at dawn.  The\r\ntramp and the \"brakey\" were friendly, and things going well.  About ten\r\no'clock, perhaps earlier, a terrific crash against the side of the car\r\nroused him.  He tried to open the door, but could not move it.  He got\r\nout of the other side, and just as he did so, he heard some one groan.\r\n\r\nThe habits of a lifetime made him cautious.  He slipped on to the\r\nbumper of a car and peered through.  An automobile had struck the car,\r\nand stood there on two wheels.  The tail lights were burning, but the\r\nheadlights were out.  Two men were stooping over some one who lay on\r\nthe ground.  Then the taller of the two started on a dog-trot along the\r\ntrain looking for an empty.  He found one four cars away and ran back\r\nagain.  The two lifted the unconscious man into the empty box-car, and,\r\ngetting in themselves, stayed for three or four minutes.  When they\r\ncame out, after closing the sliding door, they cut up over the railroad\r\nembankment toward the town.  One, the short one, seemed to limp.\r\n\r\nThe tramp was wary.  He waited for ten minutes or so.  Some women came\r\ndown a path to the road and inspected the automobile.  When they had\r\ngone, he crawled into the box-car and closed the door again.  Then he\r\nlighted a match.  The figure of a man, unconscious, gagged, and with\r\nhis hands tied, lay far at the end.\r\n\r\nThe tramp lost no time; he went through his pockets, found a little\r\nmoney and the cuff-links, and took them.  Then he loosened the gag--it\r\nhad been cruelly tight--and went his way, again closing the door of the\r\nbox-car.  Outside on the road he found the watch.  He got on the fast\r\nfreight east, some time after, and rode into the city.  He had sold the\r\ncuff-links, but on offering the watch to Alex he had been \"copped.\"\r\n\r\nThe story, with its cold recital of villainy, was done.  I hardly knew\r\nif I were more anxious, or less.  That it was Halsey, there could be no\r\ndoubt.  How badly he was hurt, how far he had been carried, were the\r\nquestions that demanded immediate answer.  But it was the first real\r\ninformation we had had; my boy had not been murdered outright.  But\r\ninstead of vague terrors there was now the real fear that he might be\r\nlying in some strange hospital receiving the casual attention commonly\r\ngiven to the charity cases.  Even this, had we known it, would have\r\nbeen paradise to the terrible truth.  I wake yet and feel myself cold\r\nand trembling with the horror of Halsey's situation for three days\r\nafter his disappearance.\r\n\r\nMr. Winters and Alex disposed of the tramp with a warning.  It was\r\nevident he had told us all he knew.  We had occasion, within a day or\r\ntwo, to be doubly thankful that we had given him his freedom.  When Mr.\r\nJamieson telephoned that night we had news for him; he told me what I\r\nhad not realized before--that it would not be possible to find Halsey\r\nat once, even with this clue.  The cars by this time, three days, might\r\nbe scattered over the Union.\r\n\r\nBut he said to keep on hoping, that it was the best news we had had.\r\nAnd in the meantime, consumed with anxiety as we were, things were\r\nhappening at the house in rapid succession.\r\n\r\nWe had one peaceful day--then Liddy took sick in the night.  I went in\r\nwhen I heard her groaning, and found her with a hot-water bottle to her\r\nface, and her right cheek swollen until it was glassy.\r\n\r\n\"Toothache?\" I asked, not too gently.  \"You deserve it.  A woman of\r\nyour age, who would rather go around with an exposed nerve in her head\r\nthan have the tooth pulled!  It would be over in a moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"So would hanging,\" Liddy protested, from behind the hot-water bottle.\r\n\r\nI was hunting around for cotton and laudanum.\r\n\r\n\"You have a tooth just like it yourself, Miss Rachel,\" she whimpered.\r\n\"And I'm sure Doctor Boyle's been trying to take it out for years.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no laudanum, and Liddy made a terrible fuss when I proposed\r\ncarbolic acid, just because I had put too much on the cotton once and\r\nburned her mouth.  I'm sure it never did her any permanent harm;\r\nindeed, the doctor said afterward that living on liquid diet had been a\r\nsplendid rest for her stomach.  But she would have none of the acid,\r\nand she kept me awake groaning, so at last I got up and went to\r\nGertrude's door.  To my surprise, it was locked.\r\n\r\nI went around by the hall and into her bedroom that way.  The bed was\r\nturned down, and her dressing-gown and night-dress lay ready in the\r\nlittle room next, but Gertrude was not there.  She had not undressed.\r\n\r\nI don't know what terrible thoughts came to me in the minute I stood\r\nthere.  Through the door I could hear Liddy grumbling, with a squeal\r\nnow and then when the pain stabbed harder.  Then, automatically, I got\r\nthe laudanum and went back to her.\r\n\r\nIt was fully a half-hour before Liddy's groans subsided.  At intervals\r\nI went to the door into the hall and looked out, but I saw and heard\r\nnothing suspicious.  Finally, when Liddy had dropped into a doze, I\r\neven ventured as far as the head of the circular staircase, but there\r\nfloated up to me only the even breathing of Winters, the night\r\ndetective, sleeping just inside the entry.  And then, far off, I heard\r\nthe rapping noise that had lured Louise down the staircase that other\r\nnight, two weeks before.  It was over my head, and very faint--three or\r\nfour short muffled taps, a pause, and then again, stealthily repeated.\r\n\r\nThe sound of Mr. Winters' breathing was comforting; with the thought\r\nthat there was help within call, something kept me from waking him.  I\r\ndid not move for a moment; ridiculous things Liddy had said about a\r\nghost--I am not at all superstitious, except, perhaps, in the middle of\r\nthe night, with everything dark--things like that came back to me.\r\nAlmost beside me was the clothes chute.  I could feel it, but I could\r\nsee nothing.  As I stood, listening intently, I heard a sound near me.\r\nIt was vague, indefinite.  Then it ceased; there was an uneasy movement\r\nand a grunt from the foot of the circular staircase, and silence again.\r\n\r\nI stood perfectly still, hardly daring to breathe.\r\n\r\nThen I knew I had been right.  Some one was stealthily-passing the head\r\nof the staircase and coming toward me in the dark.  I leaned against\r\nthe wall for support--my knees were giving way. The steps were close\r\nnow, and suddenly I thought of Gertrude.  Of course it was Gertrude.  I\r\nput out one hand in front of me, but I touched nothing.  My voice\r\nalmost refused me, but I managed to gasp out, \"Gertrude!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" a man's voice exclaimed, just beside me.  And then I\r\ncollapsed.  I felt myself going, felt some one catch me, a horrible\r\nnausea--that was all I remembered.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to it was dawn.  I was lying on the bed in Louise's room,\r\nwith the cherub on the ceiling staring down at me, and there was a\r\nblanket from my own bed thrown over me.  I felt weak and dizzy, but I\r\nmanaged to get up and totter to the door.  At the foot of the circular\r\nstaircase Mr. Winters was still asleep. Hardly able to stand, I crept\r\nback to my room.  The door into Gertrude's room was no longer locked:\r\nshe was sleeping like a tired child.  And in my dressing-room Liddy\r\nhugged a cold hot-water bottle, and mumbled in her sleep.\r\n\r\n\"There's some things you can't hold with hand cuffs,\" she was muttering\r\nthickly.\r\n\nFor the first time in twenty years, I kept my bed that day. Liddy was\r\nalarmed to the point of hysteria, and sent for Doctor Stewart just\r\nafter breakfast.  Gertrude spent the morning with me, reading\r\nsomething--I forget what.  I was too busy with my thoughts to listen.\r\nI had said nothing to the two detectives. If Mr. Jamieson had been\r\nthere, I should have told him everything, but I could not go to these\r\nstrange men and tell them my niece had been missing in the middle of\r\nthe night; that she had not gone to bed at all; that while I was\r\nsearching for her through the house, I had met a stranger who, when I\r\nfainted, had carried me into a room and left me there, to get better or\r\nnot, as it might happen.\r\n\r\nThe whole situation was terrible: had the issues been less vital, it\r\nwould have been absurd.  Here we were, guarded day and night by private\r\ndetectives, with an extra man to watch the grounds, and yet we might as\r\nwell have lived in a Japanese paper house, for all the protection we\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nAnd there was something else: the man I had met in the darkness had\r\nbeen even more startled than I, and about his voice, when he muttered\r\nhis muffled exclamation, there was something vaguely familiar.  All\r\nthat morning, while Gertrude read aloud, and Liddy watched for the\r\ndoctor, I was puzzling over that voice, without result.\r\n\r\nAnd there were other things, too.  I wondered what Gertrude's absence\r\nfrom her room had to do with it all, or if it had any connection.  I\r\ntried to think that she had heard the rapping noises before I did and\r\ngone to investigate, but I'm afraid I was a moral coward that day.  I\r\ncould not ask her.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the diversion was good for me.  It took my mind from Halsey,\r\nand the story we had heard the night before.  The day, however, was a\r\nlong vigil, with every ring of the telephone full of possibilities.\r\nDoctor Walker came up, some time just after luncheon, and asked for me.\r\n\r\n\"Go down and see him,\" I instructed Gertrude.  \"Tell him I am out--for\r\nmercy's sake don't say I'm sick.  Find out what he wants, and from this\r\ntime on, instruct the servants that he is not to be admitted.  I loathe\r\nthat man.\"\r\n\r\nGertrude came back very soon, her face rather flushed.\r\n\r\n\"He came to ask us to get out,\" she said, picking up her book with a\r\njerk.  \"He says Louise Armstrong wants to come here, now that she is\r\nrecovering.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what did you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said we were very sorry we could not leave, but we would be\r\ndelighted to have Louise come up here with us.  He looked daggers at\r\nme.  And he wanted to know if we would recommend Eliza as a cook.  He\r\nhas brought a patient, a man, out from town, and is increasing his\r\nestablishment--that's the way he put it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish him joy of Eliza,\" I said tartly.  \"Did he ask for Halsey?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  I told him that we were on the track last night, and that it was\r\nonly a question of time.  He said he was glad, although he didn't\r\nappear to be, but he said not to be too sanguine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what I believe?\" I asked.  \"I believe, as firmly as I\r\nbelieve anything, that Doctor Walker knows something about Halsey, and\r\nthat he could put his finger on him, if he wanted to.\"\r\n\r\nThere were several things that day that bewildered me.  About three\r\no'clock Mr. Jamieson telephoned from the Casanova station and Warner\r\nwent down to meet him.  I got up and dressed hastily, and the detective\r\nwas shown up to my sitting-room.\r\n\r\n\"No news?\" I asked, as he entered.  He tried to look encouraging,\r\nwithout success.  I noticed that he looked tired and dusty, and,\r\nalthough he was ordinarily impeccable in his appearance, it was clear\r\nthat he was at least two days from a razor.\r\n\r\n\"It won't be long now, Miss Innes,\" he said.  \"I have come out here on\r\na peculiar errand, which I will tell you about later. First, I want to\r\nask some questions.  Did any one come out here yesterday to repair the\r\ntelephone, and examine the wires on the roof?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said promptly; \"but it was not the telephone.  He said the\r\nwiring might have caused the fire at the stable.  I went up with him\r\nmyself, but he only looked around.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Good for you!\" he applauded.  \"Don't allow any one in the house that\r\nyou don't trust, and don't trust anybody.  All are not electricians who\r\nwear rubber gloves.\"\r\n\r\nHe refused to explain further, but he got a slip of paper out of his\r\npocketbook and opened it carefully.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" he said.  \"You heard this before and scoffed.  In the light\r\nof recent developments I want you to read it again.  You are a clever\r\nwoman, Miss Innes.  Just as surely as I sit here, there is something in\r\nthis house that is wanted very anxiously by a number of people.  The\r\nlines are closing up, Miss Innes.\"\r\n\r\nThe paper was the one he had found among Arnold Armstrong's effects,\r\nand I read it again:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"----by altering the plans for----rooms, may be possible.  The best\r\nway, in my opinion, would be to----the plan for----in one of\r\nthe----rooms----chimney.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I think I understand,\" I said slowly.  \"Some one is searching for the\r\nsecret room, and the invaders--\"\r\n\r\n\"And the holes in the plaster--\"\r\n\r\n\"Have been in the progress of his--\"\r\n\r\n\"Or her--investigations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Her?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Innes,\" the detective said, getting up, \"I believe that somewhere\r\nin the walls of this house is hidden some of the money, at least, from\r\nthe Traders' Bank.  I believe, just as surely, that young Walker\r\nbrought home from California the knowledge of something of the sort\r\nand, failing in his effort to reinstall Mrs. Armstrong and her daughter\r\nhere, he, or a confederate, has tried to break into the house.  On two\r\noccasions I think he succeeded.\"\r\n\r\n\"On three, at least,\" I corrected.  And then I told him about the night\r\nbefore.  \"I have been thinking hard,\" I concluded, \"and I do not\r\nbelieve the man at the head of the circular staircase was Doctor\r\nWalker.  I don't think he could have got in, and the voice was not his.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson got up and paced the floor, his hands behind him.\r\n\r\n\"There is something else that puzzles me,\" he said, stepping before me.\r\n\"Who and what is the woman Nina Carrington?  If it was she who came\r\nhere as Mattie Bliss, what did she tell Halsey that sent him racing to\r\nDoctor Walker's, and then to Miss Armstrong?  If we could find that\r\nwoman we would have the whole thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Jamieson, did you ever think that Paul Armstrong might not have\r\ndied a natural death?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the thing we are going to try to find out,\" he replied.  And\r\nthen Gertrude came in, announcing a man below to see Mr. Jamieson.\r\n\r\n\"I want you present at this interview, Miss Innes,\" he said. \"May Riggs\r\ncome up?  He has left Doctor Walker and he has something he wants to\r\ntell us.\"\r\n\r\nRiggs came into the room diffidently, but Mr. Jamieson put him at his\r\nease.  He kept a careful eye on me, however, and slid into a chair by\r\nthe door when he was asked to sit down.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Riggs,\" began Mr. Jamieson kindly.  \"You are to say what you have\r\nto say before this lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"You promised you'd keep it quiet, Mr. Jamieson.\"  Riggs plainly did\r\nnot trust me.  There was nothing friendly in the glance he turned on me.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes.  You will be protected.  But, first of all, did you bring\r\nwhat you promised?\"\r\n\r\nRiggs produced a roll of papers from under his coat, and handed them\r\nover.  Mr. Jamieson examined them with lively satisfaction, and passed\r\nthem to me.  \"The blue-prints of Sunnyside,\" he said. \"What did I tell\r\nyou?  Now, Riggs, we are ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd never have come to you, Mr. Jamieson,\" he began, \"if it hadn't\r\nbeen for Miss Armstrong.  When Mr. Innes was spirited away, like, and\r\nMiss Louise got sick because of it, I thought things had gone far\r\nenough.  I'd done some things for the doctor before that wouldn't just\r\nbear looking into, but I turned a bit squeamish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you help with that?\" I asked, leaning forward.\r\n\r\n\"No, ma'm.  I didn't even know of it until the next day, when it came\r\nout in the Casanova Weekly Ledger.  But I know who did it, all right.\r\nI'd better start at the beginning.\r\n\r\n\"When Doctor Walker went away to California with the Armstrong family,\r\nthere was talk in the town that when he came back he would be married\r\nto Miss Armstrong, and we all expected it. First thing I knew, I got a\r\nletter from him, in the west.  He seemed to be excited, and he said\r\nMiss Armstrong had taken a sudden notion to go home and he sent me some\r\nmoney.  I was to watch for her, to see if she went to Sunnyside, and\r\nwherever she was, not to lose sight of her until he got home.  I traced\r\nher to the lodge, and I guess I scared you on the drive one night, Miss\r\nInnes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Rosie!\" I ejaculated.\r\n\r\nRiggs grinned sheepishly.\r\n\r\n\"I only wanted to make sure Miss Louise was there.  Rosie started to\r\nrun, and I tried to stop her and tell her some sort of a story to\r\naccount for my being there.  But she wouldn't wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the broken china--in the basket?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, broken china's death to rubber tires,\" he said.  \"I hadn't any\r\ncomplaint against you people here, and the Dragon Fly was a good car.\"\r\n\r\nSo Rosie's highwayman was explained.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I telegraphed the doctor where Miss Louise was and I kept an eye\r\non her.  Just a day or so before they came home with the body, I got\r\nanother letter, telling me to watch for a woman who had been pitted\r\nwith smallpox.  Her name was Carrington, and the doctor made things\r\npretty strong.  If I found any such woman loafing around, I was not to\r\nlose sight of her for a minute until the doctor got back.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I would have had my hands full, but the other woman didn't show\r\nup for a good while, and when she did the doctor was home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Riggs,\" I asked suddenly, \"did you get into this house a day or two\r\nafter I took it, at night?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not, Miss Innes.  I have never been in the house before. Well,\r\nthe Carrington woman didn't show up until the night Mr. Halsey\r\ndisappeared.  She came to the office late, and the doctor was out.  She\r\nwaited around, walking the floor and working herself into a passion.\r\nWhen the doctor didn't come back, she was in an awful way.  She wanted\r\nme to hunt him, and when he didn't appear, she called him names; said\r\nhe couldn't fool her. There was murder being done, and she would see\r\nhim swing for it.\r\n\r\n\"She struck me as being an ugly customer, and when she left, about\r\neleven o'clock, and went across to the Armstrong place, I was not far\r\nbehind her.  She walked all around the house first, looking up at the\r\nwindows.  Then she rang the bell, and the minute the door was opened\r\nshe was through it, and into the hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long did she stay?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the queer part of it,\" Riggs said eagerly.  \"She didn't come\r\nout that night at all.  I went to bed at daylight, and that was the\r\nlast I heard of her until the next day, when I saw her on a truck at\r\nthe station, covered with a sheet.  She'd been struck by the express\r\nand you would hardly have known her--dead, of course.  I think she\r\nstayed all night in the Armstrong house, and the agent said she was\r\ncrossing the track to take the up-train to town when the express struck\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another circle!\" I exclaimed.  \"Then we are just where we started.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so bad as that, Miss Innes,\" Riggs said eagerly.  \"Nina Carrington\r\ncame from the town in California where Mr. Armstrong died.  Why was the\r\ndoctor so afraid of her?  The Carrington woman knew something.  I lived\r\nwith Doctor Walker seven years, and I know him well.  There are few\r\nthings he is afraid of.  I think he killed Mr. Armstrong out in the\r\nwest somewhere, that's what I think.  What else he did I don't\r\nknow--but he dismissed me and pretty nearly throttled me--for telling\r\nMr. Jamieson here about Mr. Innes' having been at his office the night\r\nhe disappeared, and about my hearing them quarreling.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was it Warner overheard the woman say to Mr. Innes, in the\r\nlibrary?\" the detective asked me.\r\n\r\n\"She said 'I knew there was something wrong from the start.  A man\r\nisn't well one day and dead the next without some reason.'\"\r\n\r\nHow perfectly it all seemed to fit!\r\n\nIt was on Wednesday Riggs told us the story of his connection with some\r\nincidents that had been previously unexplained.  Halsey had been gone\r\nsince the Friday night before, and with the passage of each day I felt\r\nthat his chances were lessening.  I knew well enough that he might be\r\ncarried thousands of miles in the box-car, locked in, perhaps, without\r\nwater or food.  I had read of cases where bodies had been found locked\r\nin cars on isolated sidings in the west, and my spirits went down with\r\nevery hour.\r\n\r\nHis recovery was destined to be almost as sudden as his disappearance,\r\nand was due directly to the tramp Alex had brought to Sunnyside.  It\r\nseems the man was grateful for his release, and when he learned some\r\nthing of Halsey's whereabouts from another member of his\r\nfraternity--for it is a fraternity--he was prompt in letting us know.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday evening Mr. Jamieson, who had been down at the Armstrong\r\nhouse trying to see Louise--and failing--was met near the gate at\r\nSunnyside by an individual precisely as repulsive and unkempt as the\r\none Alex had captured.  The man knew the detective, and he gave him a\r\npiece of dirty paper, on which was scrawled the words--\"He's at City\r\nHospital, Johnsville.\"  The tramp who brought the paper pretended to\r\nknow nothing, except this: the paper had been passed along from a\r\n\"hobo\" in Johnsville, who seemed to know the information would be\r\nvaluable to us.\r\n\r\nAgain the long distance telephone came into requisition.  Mr. Jamieson\r\ncalled the hospital, while we crowded around him.  And when there was\r\nno longer any doubt that it was Halsey, and that he would probably\r\nrecover, we all laughed and cried together.  I am sure I kissed Liddy,\r\nand I have had terrible moments since when I seem to remember kissing\r\nMr. Jamieson, too, in the excitement.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, by eleven o'clock that night Gertrude was on her way to\r\nJohnsville, three hundred and eighty miles away, accompanied by Rosie.\r\nThe domestic force was now down to Mary Anne and Liddy, with the\r\nunder-gardener's wife coming every day to help out. Fortunately, Warner\r\nand the detectives were keeping bachelor hall in the lodge.  Out of\r\ndeference to Liddy they washed their dishes once a day, and they\r\nconcocted queer messes, according to their several abilities.  They had\r\none triumph that they ate regularly for breakfast, and that clung to\r\ntheir clothes and their hair the rest of the day.  It was bacon,\r\nhardtack and onions, fried together.  They were almost pathetically\r\ngrateful, however, I noticed, for an occasional broiled tenderloin.\r\n\r\nIt was not until Gertrude and Rosie had gone and Sunnyside had settled\r\ndown for the night, with Winters at the foot of the staircase, that Mr.\r\nJamieson broached a subject he had evidently planned before he came.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Innes,\" he said, stopping me as I was about to go to my room\r\nup-stairs, \"how are your nerves tonight?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have none,\" I said happily.  \"With Halsey found, my troubles have\r\ngone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean,\" he persisted, \"do you feel as though you could go through\r\nwith something rather unusual?\"\r\n\r\n\"The most unusual thing I can think of would be a peaceful night.  But\r\nif anything is going to occur, don't dare to let me miss it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something is going to occur,\" he said.  \"And you're the only woman I\r\ncan think of that I can take along.\"  He looked at his watch.  \"Don't\r\nask me any questions, Miss Innes.  Put on heavy shoes, and some old\r\ndark clothes, and make up your mind not to be surprised at anything.\"\r\n\r\nLiddy was sleeping the sleep of the just when I went up-stairs, and I\r\nhunted out my things cautiously.  The detective was waiting in the\r\nhall, and I was astonished to see Doctor Stewart with him.\r\n\r\nThey were talking confidentially together, but when I came down they\r\nceased.  There were a few preparations to be made: the locks to be gone\r\nover, Winters to be instructed as to renewed vigilance, and then, after\r\nextinguishing the hall light, we crept, in the darkness, through the\r\nfront door, and into the night.\r\n\r\nI asked no questions.  I felt that they were doing me honor in making\r\nme one of the party, and I would show them I could be as silent as\r\nthey.  We went across the fields, passing through the woods that\r\nreached almost to the ruins of the stable, going over stiles now and\r\nthen, and sometimes stepping over low fences. Once only somebody spoke,\r\nand then it was an emphatic bit of profanity from Doctor Stewart when\r\nhe ran into a wire fence.\r\n\r\nWe were joined at the end of five minutes by another man, who fell into\r\nstep with the doctor silently.  He carried something over his shoulder\r\nwhich I could not make out.  In this way we walked for perhaps twenty\r\nminutes.  I had lost all sense of direction: I merely stumbled along in\r\nsilence, allowing Mr. Jamieson to guide me this way or that as the path\r\ndemanded.  I hardly know what I expected.  Once, when through a\r\nmiscalculation I jumped a little short over a ditch and landed above my\r\nshoe-tops in the water and ooze, I remember wondering if this were\r\nreally I, and if I had ever tasted life until that summer.  I walked\r\nalong with the water sloshing in my boots, and I was actually cheerful.\r\nI remember whispering to Mr. Jamieson that I had never seen the stars\r\nso lovely, and that it was a mistake, when the Lord had made the night\r\nso beautiful, to sleep through it!\r\n\r\nThe doctor was puffing somewhat when we finally came to a halt. I\r\nconfess that just at that minute even Sunnyside seemed a cheerful spot.\r\nWe had paused at the edge of a level cleared place, bordered all around\r\nwith primly trimmed evergreen trees.  Between them I caught a glimpse\r\nof starlight shining down on rows of white headstones and an occasional\r\nmore imposing monument, or towering shaft.  In spite of myself, I drew\r\nmy breath in sharply.  We were on the edge of the Casanova churchyard.\r\n\r\nI saw now both the man who had joined the party and the implements he\r\ncarried.  It was Alex, armed with two long-handled spades.  After the\r\nfirst shock of surprise, I flatter myself I was both cool and quiet.\r\nWe went in single file between the rows of headstones, and although,\r\nwhen I found myself last, I had an instinctive desire to keep looking\r\nback over my shoulder, I found that, the first uneasiness past, a\r\ncemetery at night is much the same as any other country place, filled\r\nwith vague shadows and unexpected noises.  Once, indeed--but Mr.\r\nJamieson said it was an owl, and I tried to believe him.\r\n\r\nIn the shadow of the Armstrong granite shaft we stopped.  I think the\r\ndoctor wanted to send me back.\r\n\r\n\"It's no place for a woman,\" I heard him protesting angrily.  But the\r\ndetective said something about witnesses, and the doctor only came over\r\nand felt my pulse.\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow, I don't believe you're any worse off here than you would be in\r\nthat nightmare of a house,\" he said finally, and put his coat on the\r\nsteps of the shaft for me to sit on.\r\n\r\nThere is an air of finality about a grave: one watches the earth thrown\r\nin, with the feeling that this is the end.  Whatever has gone before,\r\nwhatever is to come in eternity, that particular temple of the soul has\r\nbeen given back to the elements from which it came.  Thus, there is a\r\nsense of desecration, of a reversal of the everlasting fitness of\r\nthings, in resurrecting a body from its mother clay.  And yet that\r\nnight, in the Casanova churchyard, I sat quietly by, and watched Alex\r\nand Mr. Jamieson steaming over their work, without a single qualm,\r\nexcept the fear of detection.\r\n\r\nThe doctor kept a keen lookout, but no one appeared.  Once in a while\r\nhe came over to me, and gave me a reassuring pat on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"I never expected to come to this,\" he said once.  \"There's one thing\r\nsure--I'll not be suspected of complicity.  A doctor is generally\r\nsupposed to be handier at burying folks than at digging them up.\"\r\n\r\nThe uncanny moment came when Alex and Jamieson tossed the spades on the\r\ngrass, and I confess I hid my face.  There was a period of stress, I\r\nthink, while the heavy coffin was being raised.  I felt that my\r\ncomposure was going, and, for fear I would shriek, I tried to think of\r\nsomething else--what time Gertrude would reach Halsey--anything but the\r\ngrisly reality that lay just beyond me on the grass.\r\n\r\nAnd then I heard a low exclamation from the detective and I felt the\r\npressure of the doctor's fingers on my arm.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Miss Innes,\" he said gently.  \"If you will come over--\"\r\n\r\nI held on to him frantically, and somehow I got there and looked down.\r\nThe lid of the casket had been raised and a silver plate on it proved\r\nwe had made no mistake.  But the face that showed in the light of the\r\nlantern was a face I had never seen before.  The man who lay before us\r\nwas not Paul Armstrong!\r\n\nWhat with the excitement of the discovery, the walk home under the\r\nstars in wet shoes and draggled skirts, and getting up-stairs and\r\nundressed without rousing Liddy, I was completely used up. What to do\r\nwith my boots was the greatest puzzle of all, there being no place in\r\nthe house safe from Liddy, until I decided to slip upstairs the next\r\nmorning and drop them into the hole the \"ghost\" had made in the\r\ntrunk-room wall.\r\n\r\nI went asleep as soon as I reached this decision, and in my dreams I\r\nlived over again the events of the night.  Again I saw the group around\r\nthe silent figure on the grass, and again, as had happened at the\r\ngrave, I heard Alex's voice, tense and triumphant:\r\n\r\n\"Then we've got them,\" he said.  Only, in my dreams, he said it over\r\nand over until he seemed to shriek it in my ears.\r\n\r\nI wakened early, in spite of my fatigue, and lay there thinking. Who\r\nwas Alex?  I no longer believed that he was a gardener.  Who was the\r\nman whose body we had resurrected?  And where was Paul Armstrong?\r\nProbably living safely in some extraditionless country on the fortune\r\nhe had stolen.  Did Louise and her mother know of the shameful and\r\nwicked deception?  What had Thomas known, and Mrs. Watson?  Who was\r\nNina Carrington?\r\n\r\nThis last question, it seemed to me, was answered.  In some way the\r\nwoman had learned of the substitution, and had tried to use her\r\nknowledge for blackmail.  Nina Carrington's own story died with her,\r\nbut, however it happened, it was clear that she had carried her\r\nknowledge to Halsey the afternoon Gertrude and I were looking for clues\r\nto the man I had shot on the east veranda. Halsey had been half crazed\r\nby what he heard; it was evident that Louise was marrying Doctor Walker\r\nto keep the shameful secret, for her mother's sake.  Halsey, always\r\nreckless, had gone at once to Doctor Walker and denounced him.  There\r\nhad been a scene, and he left on his way to the station to meet and\r\nnotify Mr. Jamieson of what he had learned.  The doctor was active\r\nmentally and physically.  Accompanied perhaps by Riggs, who had shown\r\nhimself not overscrupulous until he quarreled with his employer, he had\r\ngone across to the railroad embankment, and, by jumping in front of the\r\ncar, had caused Halsey to swerve.  The rest of the story we knew.\r\n\r\nThat was my reconstructed theory of that afternoon and evening: it was\r\nalmost correct--not quite.\r\n\r\nThere was a telegram that morning from Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Halsey conscious and improving.  Probably home in day or so.\r\n                                            GERTRUDE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Halsey found and improving in health, and with at last something\r\nto work on, I began that day, Thursday, with fresh courage.  As Mr.\r\nJamieson had said, the lines were closing up. That I was to be caught\r\nand almost finished in the closing was happily unknown to us all.\r\n\r\nIt was late when I got up.  I lay in my bed, looking around the four\r\nwalls of the room, and trying to imagine behind what one of them a\r\nsecret chamber might lie.  Certainly, in daylight, Sunnyside deserved\r\nits name: never was a house more cheery and open, less sinister in\r\ngeneral appearance.  There was not a corner apparently that was not\r\nopen and above-board, and yet, somewhere behind its handsomely papered\r\nwalls I believed firmly that there lay a hidden room, with all the\r\npossibilities it would involve.\r\n\r\nI made a mental note to have the house measured during the day, to\r\ndiscover any discrepancy between the outer and inner walls, and I tried\r\nto recall again the exact wording of the paper Jamieson had found.\r\n\r\nThe slip had said \"chimney.\"  It was the only clue, and a house as\r\nlarge as Sunnyside was full of them.  There was an open fireplace in my\r\ndressing-room, but none in the bedroom, and as I lay there, looking\r\naround, I thought of something that made me sit up suddenly.  The\r\ntrunk-room, just over my head, had an open fireplace and a brick\r\nchimney, and yet, there was nothing of the kind in my room.  I got out\r\nof bed and examined the opposite wall closely.  There was apparently no\r\nflue, and I knew there was none in the hall just beneath.  The house\r\nwas heated by steam, as I have said before.  In the living-room was a\r\nhuge open fireplace, but it was on the other side.\r\n\r\nWhy did the trunk-room have both a radiator and an open fireplace?\r\nArchitects were not usually erratic!  It was not fifteen minutes before\r\nI was up-stairs, armed with a tape-measure in lieu of a foot-rule,\r\neager to justify Mr. Jamieson's opinion of my intelligence, and firmly\r\nresolved not to tell him of my suspicion until I had more than theory\r\nto go on.  The hole in the trunk-room wall still yawned there, between\r\nthe chimney and the outer wall.  I examined it again, with no new\r\nresult. The space between the brick wall and the plaster and lath one,\r\nhowever, had a new significance.  The hole showed only one side of the\r\nchimney, and I determined to investigate what lay in the space on the\r\nother side of the mantel.\r\n\r\nI worked feverishly.  Liddy had gone to the village to market, it being\r\nher firm belief that the store people sent short measure unless she\r\nwatched the scales, and that, since the failure of the Traders' Bank,\r\nwe must watch the corners; and I knew that what I wanted to do must be\r\ndone before she came back.  I had no tools, but after rummaging around\r\nI found a pair of garden scissors and a hatchet, and thus armed, I set\r\nto work.  The plaster came out easily: the lathing was more obstinate.\r\nIt gave under the blows, only to spring back into place again, and the\r\nnecessity for caution made it doubly hard.\r\n\r\nI had a blister on my palm when at last the hatchet went through and\r\nfell with what sounded like the report of a gun to my overstrained\r\nnerves.  I sat on a trunk, waiting to hear Liddy fly up the stairs,\r\nwith the household behind her, like the tail of a comet.  But nothing\r\nhappened, and with a growing feeling of uncanniness I set to work\r\nenlarging the opening.\r\n\r\nThe result was absolutely nil.  When I could hold a lighted candle in\r\nthe opening, I saw precisely what I had seen on the other side of the\r\nchimney--a space between the true wall and the false one, possibly\r\nseven feet long and about three feet wide. It was in no sense of the\r\nword a secret chamber, and it was evident it had not been disturbed\r\nsince the house was built.  It was a supreme disappointment.\r\n\r\nIt had been Mr. Jamieson's idea that the hidden room, if there was one,\r\nwould be found somewhere near the circular staircase. In fact, I knew\r\nthat he had once investigated the entire length of the clothes chute,\r\nhanging to a rope, with this in view.  I was reluctantly about to\r\nconcede that he had been right, when my eyes fell on the mantel and\r\nfireplace.  The latter had evidently never been used: it was closed\r\nwith a metal fire front, and only when the front refused to move, and\r\ninvestigation showed that it was not intended to be moved, did my\r\nspirits revive.\r\n\r\nI hurried into the next room.  Yes, sure enough, there was a similar\r\nmantel and fireplace there, similarly closed.  In both rooms the\r\nchimney flue extended well out from the wall.  I measured with the\r\ntape-line, my hands trembling so that I could scarcely hold it.  They\r\nextended two feet and a half into each room, which, with the three feet\r\nof space between the two partitions, made eight feet to be accounted\r\nfor.  Eight feet in one direction and almost seven in the other--what a\r\nchimney it was!\r\n\r\nBut I had only located the hidden room.  I was not in it, and no amount\r\nof pressing on the carving of the wooden mantels, no search of the\r\nfloors for loose boards, none of the customary methods availed at all.\r\nThat there was a means of entrance, and probably a simple one, I could\r\nbe certain.  But what?  What would I find if I did get in?  Was the\r\ndetective right, and were the bonds and money from the Traders' Bank\r\nthere?  Or was our whole theory wrong?  Would not Paul Armstrong have\r\ntaken his booty with him?  If he had not, and if Doctor Walker was in\r\nthe secret, he would have known how to enter the chimney room.\r\nThen--who had dug the other hole in the false partition?\r\n\nLiddy discovered the fresh break in the trunk-room wall while we were\r\nat luncheon, and ran shrieking down the stairs.  She maintained that,\r\nas she entered, unseen hands had been digging at the plaster; that they\r\nhad stopped when she went in, and she had felt a gust of cold damp air.\r\nIn support of her story she carried in my wet and muddy boots, that I\r\nhad unluckily forgotten to hide, and held them out to the detective and\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n\"What did I tell you?\" she said dramatically.  \"Look at 'em. They're\r\nyours, Miss Rachel--and covered with mud and soaked to the tops.  I\r\ntell you, you can scoff all you like; something has been wearing your\r\nshoes.  As sure as you sit there, there's the smell of the graveyard on\r\nthem.  How do we know they weren't tramping through the Casanova\r\nchurchyard last night, and sitting on the graves!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jamieson almost choked to death.  \"I wouldn't be at all surprised\r\nif they were doing that very thing, Liddy,\" he said, when he got his\r\nbreath.  \"They certainly look like it.\"\r\n\r\nI think the detective had a plan, on which he was working, and which\r\nwas meant to be a coup.  But things went so fast there was no time to\r\ncarry it into effect.  The first thing that occurred was a message from\r\nthe Charity Hospital that Mrs. Watson was dying, and had asked for me.\r\nI did not care much about going.  There is a sort of melancholy\r\npleasure to be had out of a funeral, with its pomp and ceremony, but I\r\nshrank from a death-bed. However, Liddy got out the black things and\r\nthe crape veil I keep for such occasions, and I went.  I left Mr.\r\nJamieson and the day detective going over every inch of the circular\r\nstaircase, pounding, probing and measuring.  I was inwardly elated to\r\nthink of the surprise I was going to give them that night; as it turned\r\nout, I DID surprise them almost into spasms.\r\n\r\nI drove from the train to the Charity Hospital, and was at once taken\r\nto a ward.  There, in a gray-walled room in a high iron bed, lay Mrs.\r\nWatson.  She was very weak, and she only opened her eyes and looked at\r\nme when I sat down beside her.  I was conscience-stricken.  We had been\r\nso engrossed that I had left this poor creature to die without even a\r\nword of sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe nurse gave her a stimulant, and in a little while she was able to\r\ntalk.  So broken and half-coherent, however, was her story that I shall\r\ntell it in my own way.  In an hour from the time I entered the Charity\r\nHospital, I had heard a sad and pitiful narrative, and had seen a woman\r\nslip into the unconsciousness that is only a step from death.\r\n\r\nBriefly, then, the housekeeper's story was this:\r\n\r\nShe was almost forty years old, and had been the sister-mother of a\r\nlarge family of children.  One by one they had died, and been buried\r\nbeside their parents in a little town in the Middle West. There was\r\nonly one sister left, the baby, Lucy.  On her the older girl had\r\nlavished all the love of an impulsive and emotional nature.  When Anne,\r\nthe elder, was thirty-two and Lucy was nineteen, a young man had come\r\nto the town.  He was going east, after spending the summer at a\r\ncelebrated ranch in Wyoming--one of those places where wealthy men send\r\nworthless and dissipated sons, for a season of temperance, fresh air\r\nand hunting.  The sisters, of course, knew nothing of this, and the\r\nyoung man's ardor rather carried them away.  In a word, seven years\r\nbefore, Lucy Haswell had married a young man whose name was given as\r\nAubrey Wallace.\r\n\r\nAnne Haswell had married a carpenter in her native town, and was a\r\nwidow.  For three months everything went fairly well.  Aubrey took his\r\nbride to Chicago, where they lived at a hotel.  Perhaps the very\r\nunsophistication that had charmed him in Valley Mill jarred on him in\r\nthe city.  He had been far from a model husband, even for the three\r\nmonths, and when he disappeared Anne was almost thankful.  It was\r\ndifferent with the young wife, however. She drooped and fretted, and on\r\nthe birth of her baby boy, she had died.  Anne took the child, and\r\nnamed him Lucien.\r\n\r\nAnne had had no children of her own, and on Lucien she had lavished all\r\nher aborted maternal instinct.  On one thing she was determined,\r\nhowever: that was that Aubrey Wallace should educate his boy.  It was a\r\npart of her devotion to the child that she should be ambitious for him:\r\nhe must have every opportunity.  And so she came east.  She drifted\r\naround, doing plain sewing and keeping a home somewhere always for the\r\nboy.  Finally, however, she realized that her only training had been\r\ndomestic, and she put the boy in an Episcopalian home, and secured the\r\nposition of housekeeper to the Armstrongs.  There she found Lucien's\r\nfather, this time under his own name.  It was Arnold Armstrong.\r\n\r\nI gathered that there was no particular enmity at that time in Anne's\r\nmind.  She told him of the boy, and threatened exposure if he did not\r\nprovide for him.  Indeed, for a time, he did so.  Then he realized that\r\nLucien was the ruling passion in this lonely woman's life.  He found\r\nout where the child was hidden, and threatened to take him away.  Anne\r\nwas frantic.  The positions became reversed.  Where Arnold had given\r\nmoney for Lucien's support, as the years went on he forced money from\r\nAnne Watson instead until she was always penniless.  The lower Arnold\r\nsank in the scale, the heavier his demands became.  With the rupture\r\nbetween him and his family, things were worse.  Anne took the child\r\nfrom the home and hid him in a farmhouse near Casanova, on the\r\nClaysburg road.  There she went sometimes to see the boy, and there he\r\nhad taken fever.  The people were Germans, and he called the farmer's\r\nwife Grossmutter.  He had grown into a beautiful boy, and he was all\r\nAnne had to live for.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Armstrongs left for California, and Arnold's persecutions began\r\nanew.  He was furious over the child's disappearance and she was afraid\r\nhe would do her some hurt.  She left the big house and went down to the\r\nlodge.  When I had rented Sunnyside, however, she had thought the\r\npersecutions would stop.  She had applied for the position of\r\nhousekeeper, and secured it.\r\n\r\nThat had been on Saturday.  That night Louise arrived unexpectedly.\r\nThomas sent for Mrs. Watson and then went for Arnold Armstrong at the\r\nGreenwood Club.  Anne had been fond of Louise--she reminded her of\r\nLucy.  She did not know what the trouble was, but Louise had been in a\r\nstate of terrible excitement.  Mrs. Watson tried to hide from Arnold,\r\nbut he was ugly.  He left the lodge and went up to the house about\r\ntwo-thirty, was admitted at the east entrance and came out again very\r\nsoon.  Something had occurred, she didn't know what; but very soon Mr.\r\nInnes and another gentleman left, using the car.\r\n\r\nThomas and she had got Louise quiet, and a little before three, Mrs.\r\nWatson started up to the house.  Thomas had a key to the east entry,\r\nand gave it to her.\r\n\r\nOn the way across the lawn she was confronted by Arnold, who for some\r\nreason was determined to get into the house.  He had a golf-stick in\r\nhis hand, that he had picked up somewhere, and on her refusal he had\r\nstruck her with it.  One hand had been badly cut, and it was that,\r\npoisoning having set in, which was killing her.  She broke away in a\r\nfrenzy of rage and fear, and got into the house while Gertrude and Jack\r\nBailey were at the front door. She went up-stairs, hardly knowing what\r\nshe was doing. Gertrude's door was open, and Halsey's revolver lay\r\nthere on the bed.  She picked it up and turning, ran part way down the\r\ncircular staircase.  She could hear Arnold fumbling at the lock\r\noutside.  She slipped down quietly and opened the door: he was inside\r\nbefore she had got back to the stairs.  It was quite dark, but she\r\ncould see his white shirt-bosom.  From the fourth step she fired.  As\r\nhe fell, somebody in the billiard-room screamed and ran.  When the\r\nalarm was raised, she had had no time to get up-stairs: she hid in the\r\nwest wing until every one was down on the lower floor.  Then she\r\nslipped upstairs, and threw the revolver out of an upper window, going\r\ndown again in time to admit the men from the Greenwood Club.\r\n\r\nIf Thomas had suspected, he had never told.  When she found the hand\r\nArnold had injured was growing worse, she gave the address of Lucien at\r\nRichfield to the old man, and almost a hundred dollars.  The money was\r\nfor Lucien's board until she recovered.  She had sent for me to ask me\r\nif I would try to interest the Armstrongs in the child.  When she found\r\nherself growing worse, she had written to Mrs. Armstrong, telling her\r\nnothing but that Arnold's legitimate child was at Richfield, and\r\nimploring her to recognize him.  She was dying: the boy was an\r\nArmstrong, and entitled to his father's share of the estate.  The\r\npapers were in her trunk at Sunnyside, with letters from the dead man\r\nthat would prove what she said.  She was going; she would not be judged\r\nby earthly laws; and somewhere else perhaps Lucy would plead for her.\r\nIt was she who had crept down the circular staircase, drawn by a\r\nmagnet, that night Mr. Jamieson had heard some one there.  Pursued, she\r\nhad fled madly, anywhere--through the first door she came to.  She had\r\nfallen down the clothes chute, and been saved by the basket beneath.  I\r\ncould have cried with relief; then it had not been Gertrude, after all!\r\n\r\nThat was the story.  Sad and tragic though it was, the very telling of\r\nit seemed to relieve the dying woman.  She did not know that Thomas was\r\ndead, and I did not tell her.  I promised to look after little Lucien,\r\nand sat with her until the intervals of consciousness grew shorter and\r\nfinally ceased altogether.  She died that night.\r\n\nAs I drove rapidly up to the house from Casanova Station in the hack, I\r\nsaw the detective Burns loitering across the street from the Walker\r\nplace.  So Jamieson was putting the screws on--lightly now, but ready\r\nto give them a twist or two, I felt certain, very soon.\r\n\r\nThe house was quiet.  Two steps of the circular staircase had been\r\npried off, without result, and beyond a second message from Gertrude,\r\nthat Halsey insisted on coming home and they would arrive that night,\r\nthere was nothing new.  Mr. Jamieson, having failed to locate the\r\nsecret room, had gone to the village.  I learned afterwards that he\r\ncalled at Doctor Walker's, under pretense of an attack of acute\r\nindigestion, and before he left, had inquired about the evening trains\r\nto the city.  He said he had wasted a lot of time on the case, and a\r\ngood bit of the mystery was in my imagination!  The doctor was under\r\nthe impression that the house was guarded day and night.  Well, give a\r\nplace a reputation like that, and you don't need a guard at all,--thus\r\nJamieson.  And sure enough, late in the afternoon, the two private\r\ndetectives, accompanied by Mr. Jamieson, walked down the main street of\r\nCasanova and took a city-bound train.\r\n\r\nThat they got off at the next station and walked back again to\r\nSunnyside at dusk, was not known at the time.  Personally, I knew\r\nnothing of either move; I had other things to absorb me at that time.\r\n\r\nLiddy brought me some tea while I rested after my trip, and on the tray\r\nwas a small book from the Casanova library.  It was called The Unseen\r\nWorld and had a cheerful cover on which a half-dozen sheeted figures\r\nlinked hands around a headstone.\r\n\r\nAt this point in my story, Halsey always says:  \"Trust a woman to add\r\ntwo and two together, and make six.\"  To which I retort that if two and\r\ntwo plus X make six, then to discover the unknown quantity is the\r\nsimplest thing in the world.  That a houseful of detectives missed it\r\nentirely was because they were busy trying to prove that two and two\r\nmake four.\r\n\r\nThe depression due to my visit to the hospital left me at the prospect\r\nof seeing Halsey again that night.  It was about five o'clock when\r\nLiddy left me for a nap before dinner, having put me into a gray silk\r\ndressing-gown and a pair of slippers.  I listened to her retreating\r\nfootsteps, and as soon as she was safely below stairs, I went up to the\r\ntrunk-room.  The place had not been disturbed, and I proceeded at once\r\nto try to discover the entrance to the hidden room.  The openings on\r\neither side, as I have said, showed nothing but perhaps three feet of\r\nbrick wall.\r\n\r\nThere was no sign of an entrance--no levers, no hinges, to give a hint.\r\nEither the mantel or the roof, I decided, and after a half-hour at the\r\nmantel, productive of absolutely no result, I decided to try the roof.\r\n\r\nI am not fond of a height.  The few occasions on which I have climbed a\r\nstep-ladder have always left me dizzy and weak in the knees.  The top\r\nof the Washington monument is as impossible to me as the elevation of\r\nthe presidential chair.  And yet--I climbed out on to the Sunnyside\r\nroof without a second's hesitation.  Like a dog on a scent, like my\r\nbearskin progenitor, with his spear and his wild boar, to me now there\r\nwas the lust of the chase, the frenzy of pursuit, the dust of battle.\r\nI got quite a little of the latter on me as I climbed from the\r\nunfinished ball-room out through a window to the roof of the east wing\r\nof the building, which was only two stories in height.\r\n\r\nOnce out there, access to the top of the main building was rendered\r\neasy--at least it looked easy--by a small vertical iron ladder,\r\nfastened to the wall outside of the ball-room, and perhaps twelve feet\r\nhigh.  The twelve feet looked short from below, but they were difficult\r\nto climb.  I gathered my silk gown around me, and succeeded finally in\r\nmaking the top of the ladder.\r\n\r\nOnce there, however, I was completely out of breath.  I sat down, my\r\nfeet on the top rung, and put my hair pins in more securely, while the\r\nwind bellowed my dressing-gown out like a sail.  I had torn a great\r\nstrip of the silk loose, and now I ruthlessly finished the destruction\r\nof my gown by jerking it free and tying it around my head.\r\n\r\nFrom far below the smallest sounds came up with peculiar distinctness.\r\nI could hear the paper boy whistling down the drive, and I heard\r\nsomething else.  I heard the thud of a stone, and a spit, followed by a\r\nlong and startled meiou from Beulah. I forgot my fear of a height, and\r\nadvanced boldly almost to the edge of the roof.\r\n\r\nIt was half-past six by that time, and growing dusk.\r\n\r\n\"You boy, down there!\" I called.\r\n\r\nThe paper boy turned and looked around.  Then, seeing nobody, he raised\r\nhis eyes.  It was a moment before he located me: when he did, he stood\r\nfor one moment as if paralyzed, then he gave a horrible yell, and\r\ndropping his papers, bolted across the lawn to the road without\r\nstopping to look around.  Once he fell, and his impetus was so great\r\nthat he turned an involuntary somersault. He was up and off again\r\nwithout any perceptible pause, and he leaped the hedge--which I am sure\r\nunder ordinary stress would have been a feat for a man.\r\n\r\nI am glad in this way to settle the Gray Lady story, which is still a\r\nchoice morsel in Casanova.  I believe the moral deduced by the village\r\nwas that it is always unlucky to throw a stone at a black cat.\r\n\r\nWith Johnny Sweeny a cloud of dust down the road, and the dinner-hour\r\napproaching, I hurried on with my investigations.  Luckily, the roof\r\nwas flat, and I was able to go over every inch of it. But the result\r\nwas disappointing; no trap-door revealed itself, no glass window;\r\nnothing but a couple of pipes two inches across, and standing perhaps\r\neighteen inches high and three feet apart, with a cap to prevent rain\r\nfrom entering and raised to permit the passage of air.  I picked up a\r\npebble from the roof and dropped it down, listening with my ear at one\r\nof the pipes. I could hear it strike on something with a sharp,\r\nmetallic sound, but it was impossible for me to tell how far it had\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nI gave up finally and went down the ladder again, getting in through\r\nthe ball-room window without being observed.  I went back at once to\r\nthe trunk-room, and, sitting down on a box, I gave my mind, as\r\nconsistently as I could, to the problem before me.  If the pipes in the\r\nroof were ventilators to the secret room, and there was no trap-door\r\nabove, the entrance was probably in one of the two rooms between which\r\nit lay--unless, indeed, the room had been built, and the opening then\r\nclosed with a brick and mortar wall.\r\n\r\nThe mantel fascinated me.  Made of wood and carved, the more I looked\r\nthe more I wondered that I had not noticed before the absurdity of such\r\na mantel in such a place.  It was covered with scrolls and panels, and\r\nfinally, by the merest accident, I pushed one of the panels to the\r\nside.  It moved easily, revealing a small brass knob.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to detail the fluctuations of hope and despair, and\r\nnot a little fear of what lay beyond, with which I twisted and turned\r\nthe knob.  It moved, but nothing seemed to happen, and then I\r\ndiscovered the trouble.  I pushed the knob vigorously to one side, and\r\nthe whole mantel swung loose from the wall almost a foot, revealing a\r\ncavernous space beyond.\r\n\r\nI took a long breath, closed the door from the trunk-room into the\r\nhall--thank Heaven, I did not lock it--and pulling the mantel-door wide\r\nopen, I stepped into the chimney-room.  I had time to get a hazy view\r\nof a small portable safe, a common wooden table and a chair--then the\r\nmantel door swung to, and clicked behind me.  I stood quite still for a\r\nmoment, in the darkness, unable to comprehend what had happened.  Then\r\nI turned and beat furiously at the door with my fists.  It was closed\r\nand locked again, and my fingers in the darkness slid over a smooth\r\nwooden surface without a sign of a knob.\r\n\r\nI was furiously angry--at myself, at the mantel door, at everything.  I\r\ndid not fear suffocation; before the thought had come to me I had\r\nalready seen a gleam of light from the two small ventilating pipes in\r\nthe roof.  They supplied air, but nothing else.  The room itself was\r\nshrouded in blackness.\r\n\r\nI sat down in the stiff-backed chair and tried to remember how many\r\ndays one could live without food and water.  When that grew monotonous\r\nand rather painful, I got up and, according to the time-honored rule\r\nfor people shut in unknown and ink-black prisons, I felt my way\r\naround--it was small enough, goodness knows.  I felt nothing but a\r\nsplintery surface of boards, and in endeavoring to get back to the\r\nchair, something struck me full in the face, and fell with the noise of\r\na thousand explosions to the ground.  When I had gathered up my nerves\r\nagain, I found it had been the bulb of a swinging electric light, and\r\nthat had it not been for the accident, I might have starved to death in\r\nan illuminated sepulcher.\r\n\r\nI must have dozed off.  I am sure I did not faint.  I was never more\r\ncomposed in my life.  I remember planning, if I were not discovered,\r\nwho would have my things.  I knew Liddy would want my heliotrope\r\npoplin, and she's a fright in lavender.  Once or twice I heard mice in\r\nthe partitions, and so I sat on the table, with my feet on the chair.\r\nI imagined I could hear the search going on through the house, and once\r\nsome one came into the trunk-room; I could distinctly hear footsteps.\r\n\r\n\"In the chimney!  In the chimney!\" I called with all my might, and was\r\nrewarded by a piercing shriek from Liddy and the slam of the trunk-room\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nI felt easier after that, although the room was oppressively hot and\r\nenervating.  I had no doubt the search for me would now come in the\r\nright direction, and after a little, I dropped into a doze.  How long I\r\nslept I do not know.\r\n\r\nIt must have been several hours, for I had been tired from a busy day,\r\nand I wakened stiff from my awkward position.  I could not remember\r\nwhere I was for a few minutes, and my head felt heavy and congested.\r\nGradually I roused to my surroundings, and to the fact that in spite of\r\nthe ventilators, the air was bad and growing worse.  I was breathing\r\nlong, gasping respirations, and my face was damp and clammy.  I must\r\nhave been there a long time, and the searchers were probably hunting\r\noutside the house, dredging the creek, or beating the woodland.  I knew\r\nthat another hour or two would find me unconscious, and with my\r\ninability to cry out would go my only chance of rescue.  It was the\r\ncombination of bad air and heat, probably, for some inadequate\r\nventilation was coming through the pipes.  I tried to retain my\r\nconsciousness by walking the length of the room and back, over and\r\nover, but I had not the strength to keep it up, so I sat down on the\r\ntable again, my back against the wall.\r\n\r\nThe house was very still.  Once my straining ears seemed to catch a\r\nfootfall beneath me, possibly in my own room.  I groped for the chair\r\nfrom the table, and pounded with it frantically on the floor.  But\r\nnothing happened: I realized bitterly that if the sound was heard at\r\nall, no doubt it was classed with the other rappings that had so\r\nalarmed us recently.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to judge the flight of time.  I measured five minutes\r\nby counting my pulse, allowing seventy-two beats to the minute.  But it\r\ntook eternities, and toward the last I found it hard to count; my head\r\nwas confused.\r\n\r\nAnd then--I heard sounds from below me, in the house.  There was a\r\npeculiar throbbing, vibrating noise that I felt rather than heard, much\r\nlike the pulsing beat of fire engines in the city. For one awful moment\r\nI thought the house was on fire, and every drop of blood in my body\r\ngathered around my heart; then I knew.  It was the engine of the\r\nautomobile, and Halsey had come back.  Hope sprang up afresh.  Halsey's\r\nclear head and Gertrude's intuition might do what Liddy's hysteria and\r\nthree detectives had failed in.\r\n\r\nAfter a time I thought I had been right.  There was certainly something\r\ngoing on down below; doors were slamming, people were hurrying through\r\nthe halls, and certain high notes of excited voices penetrated to me\r\nshrilly.  I hoped they were coming closer, but after a time the sounds\r\ndied away below, and I was left to the silence and heat, to the weight\r\nof the darkness, to the oppression of walls that seemed to close in on\r\nme and stifle me.\r\n\r\nThe first warning I had was a stealthy fumbling at the lock of the\r\nmantel-door.  With my mouth open to scream, I stopped. Perhaps the\r\nsituation had rendered me acute, perhaps it was instinctive.  Whatever\r\nit was, I sat without moving, and some one outside, in absolute\r\nstillness, ran his fingers over the carving of the mantel and--found\r\nthe panel.\r\n\r\nNow the sounds below redoubled: from the clatter and jarring I knew\r\nthat several people were running up the stairs, and as the sounds\r\napproached, I could even hear what they said.\r\n\r\n\"Watch the end staircases!\" Jamieson was shouting.  \"Damnation--there's\r\nno light here!\"  And then a second later.  \"All together now.\r\nOne--two--three--\"\r\n\r\nThe door into the trunk-room had been locked from the inside.  At the\r\nsecond that it gave, opening against the wall with a crash and\r\nevidently tumbling somebody into the room, the stealthy fingers beyond\r\nthe mantel-door gave the knob the proper impetus, and--the door swung\r\nopen, and closed again.  Only--and Liddy always screams and puts her\r\nfingers in her ears at this point--only now I was not alone in the\r\nchimney room.  There was some one else in the darkness, some one who\r\nbreathed hard, and who was so close I could have touched him with my\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nI was in a paralysis of terror.  Outside there were excited voices and\r\nincredulous oaths.  The trunks were being jerked around in a frantic\r\nsearch, the windows were thrown open, only to show a sheer drop of\r\nforty feet.  And the man in the room with me leaned against the\r\nmantel-door and listened.  His pursuers were plainly baffled: I heard\r\nhim draw a long breath, and turn to grope his way through the\r\nblackness.  Then--he touched my hand, cold, clammy, death-like.\r\n\r\nA hand in an empty room!  He drew in his breath, the sharp intaking of\r\nhorror that fills lungs suddenly collapsed.  Beyond jerking his hand\r\naway instantly, he made no movement.  I think absolute terror had him\r\nby the throat.  Then he stepped back, without turning, retreating foot\r\nby foot from The Dread in the corner, and I do not think he breathed.\r\n\r\nThen, with the relief of space between us, I screamed, ear-splittingly,\r\nmadly, and they heard me outside.\r\n\r\n\"In the chimney!\" I shrieked.  \"Behind the mantel!  The mantel!\"\r\n\r\nWith an oath the figure hurled itself across the room at me, and I\r\nscreamed again.  In his blind fury he had missed me; I heard him strike\r\nthe wall.  That one time I eluded him; I was across the room, and I had\r\ngot the chair.  He stood for a second, listening, then--he made another\r\nrush, and I struck out with my weapon.  I think it stunned him, for I\r\nhad a second's respite when I could hear him breathing, and some one\r\nshouted outside:\r\n\r\n\"We--Can't--get--in.  How--does--it--open?\"\r\n\r\nBut the man in the room had changed his tactics.  I knew he was\r\ncreeping on me, inch by inch, and I could not tell from where. And\r\nthen--he caught me.  He held his hand over my mouth, and I bit him.  I\r\nwas helpless, strangling,--and some one was trying to break in the\r\nmantel from outside.  It began to yield somewhere, for a thin wedge of\r\nyellowish light was reflected on the opposite wall.  When he saw that,\r\nmy assailant dropped me with a curse; then--the opposite wall swung\r\nopen noiselessly, closed again without a sound, and I was alone.  The\r\nintruder was gone.\r\n\r\n\"In the next room!\" I called wildly.  \"The next room!\"  But the sound\r\nof blows on the mantel drowned my voice.  By the time I had made them\r\nunderstand, a couple of minutes had elapsed.  The pursuit was taken up\r\nthen, by all except Alex, who was determined to liberate me.  When I\r\nstepped out into the trunk-room, a free woman again, I could hear the\r\nchase far below.\r\n\r\nI must say, for all Alex's anxiety to set me free, he paid little\r\nenough attention to my plight.  He jumped through the opening into the\r\nsecret room, and picked up the portable safe.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to put this in Mr. Halsey's room, Miss Innes,\" he said,\r\n\"and I shall send one of the detectives to guard it.\"\r\n\r\nI hardly heard him.  I wanted to laugh and cry in the same breath--to\r\ncrawl into bed and have a cup of tea, and scold Liddy, and do any of\r\nthe thousand natural things that I had never expected to do again.  And\r\nthe air!  The touch of the cool night air on my face!\r\n\r\nAs Alex and I reached the second floor, Mr. Jamieson met us.  He was\r\ngrave and quiet, and he nodded comprehendingly when he saw the safe.\r\n\r\n\"Will you come with me for a moment, Miss Innes?\" he asked soberly, and\r\non my assenting, he led the way to the east wing. There were lights\r\nmoving around below, and some of the maids were standing gaping down.\r\nThey screamed when they saw me, and drew back to let me pass.  There\r\nwas a sort of hush over the scene; Alex, behind me, muttered something\r\nI could not hear, and brushed past me without ceremony.  Then I\r\nrealized that a man was lying doubled up at the foot of the staircase,\r\nand that Alex was stooping over him.\r\n\r\nAs I came slowly down, Winters stepped back, and Alex straightened\r\nhimself, looking at me across the body with impenetrable eyes.  In his\r\nhand he held a shaggy gray wig, and before me on the floor lay the man\r\nwhose headstone stood in Casanova churchyard--Paul Armstrong.\r\n\r\nWinters told the story in a dozen words.  In his headlong flight down\r\nthe circular staircase, with Winters just behind, Paul Armstrong had\r\npitched forward violently, struck his head against the door to the east\r\nveranda, and probably broken his neck.  He had died as Winters reached\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAs the detective finished, I saw Halsey, pale and shaken, in the\r\ncard-room doorway, and for the first time that night I lost my\r\nself-control.  I put my arms around my boy, and for a moment he had to\r\nsupport me.  A second later, over Halsey's shoulder, I saw something\r\nthat turned my emotion into other channels, for, behind him, in the\r\nshadowy card-room, were Gertrude and Alex, the gardener, and--there is\r\nno use mincing matters--he was kissing her!\r\n\r\nI was unable to speak.  Twice I opened my mouth: then I turned Halsey\r\naround and pointed.  They were quite unconscious of us; her head was on\r\nhis shoulder, his face against her hair.  As it happened, it was Mr.\r\nJamieson who broke up the tableau.\r\n\r\nHe stepped over to Alex and touched him on the arm.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" he said quietly, \"how long are you and I to play OUR little\r\ncomedy, Mr. Bailey?\"\r\n\nOf Doctor Walker's sensational escape that night to South America, of\r\nthe recovery of over a million dollars in cash and securities in the\r\nsafe from the chimney room--the papers have kept the public well\r\ninformed.  Of my share in discovering the secret chamber they have been\r\nsingularly silent.  The inner history has never been told.  Mr.\r\nJamieson got all kinds of credit, and some of it he deserved, but if\r\nJack Bailey, as Alex, had not traced Halsey and insisted on the\r\ndisinterring of Paul Armstrong's casket, if he had not suspected the\r\ntruth from the start, where would the detective have been?\r\n\r\nWhen Halsey learned the truth, he insisted on going the next morning,\r\nweak as he was, to Louise, and by night she was at Sunnyside, under\r\nGertrude's particular care, while her mother had gone to Barbara\r\nFitzhugh's.\r\n\r\nWhat Halsey said to Mrs. Armstrong I never knew, but that he was\r\nconsiderate and chivalrous I feel confident.  It was Halsey's way\r\nalways with women.\r\n\r\nHe and Louise had no conversation together until that night. Gertrude\r\nand Alex--I mean Jack--had gone for a walk, although it was nine\r\no'clock, and anybody but a pair of young geese would have known that\r\ndew was falling, and that it is next to impossible to get rid of a\r\nsummer cold.\r\n\r\nAt half after nine, growing weary of my own company, I went downstairs\r\nto find the young people.  At the door of the living-room I paused.\r\nGertrude and Jack had returned and were there, sitting together on a\r\ndivan, with only one lamp lighted.  They did not see or hear me, and I\r\nbeat a hasty retreat to the library.  But here again I was driven back.\r\nLouise was sitting in a deep chair, looking the happiest I had ever\r\nseen her, with Halsey on the arm of the chair, holding her close.\r\n\r\nIt was no place for an elderly spinster.  I retired to my upstairs\r\nsitting-room and got out Eliza Klinefelter's lavender slippers.  Ah,\r\nwell, the foster motherhood would soon have to be put away in camphor\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe next day, by degrees, I got the whole story.\r\n\r\nPaul Armstrong had a besetting evil--the love of money.  Common enough,\r\nbut he loved money, not for what it would buy, but for its own sake.\r\nAn examination of the books showed no irregularities in the past year\r\nsince John had been cashier, but before that, in the time of Anderson,\r\nthe old cashier, who had died, much strange juggling had been done with\r\nthe records.  The railroad in New Mexico had apparently drained the\r\nbanker's private fortune, and he determined to retrieve it by one\r\nstroke. This was nothing less than the looting of the bank's\r\nsecurities, turning them into money, and making his escape.\r\n\r\nBut the law has long arms.  Paul Armstrong evidently studied the\r\nsituation carefully.  Just as the only good Indian is a dead Indian, so\r\nthe only safe defaulter is a dead defaulter.  He decided to die, to all\r\nappearances, and when the hue and cry subsided, he would be able to\r\nenjoy his money almost anywhere he wished.\r\n\r\nThe first necessity was an accomplice.  The connivance of Doctor Walker\r\nwas suggested by his love for Louise.  The man was unscrupulous, and\r\nwith the girl as a bait, Paul Armstrong soon had him fast.  The plan\r\nwas apparently the acme of simplicity: a small town in the west, an\r\nattack of heart disease, a body from a medical college dissecting-room\r\nshipped in a trunk to Doctor Walker by a colleague in San Francisco,\r\nand palmed off for the supposed dead banker.  What was simpler?\r\n\r\nThe woman, Nina Carrington, was the cog that slipped.  What she only\r\nsuspected, what she really knew, we never learned.  She was a\r\nchambermaid in the hotel at C--, and it was evidently her intention to\r\nblackmail Doctor Walker.  His position at that time was uncomfortable:\r\nto pay the woman to keep quiet would be confession.  He denied the\r\nwhole thing, and she went to Halsey.\r\n\r\nIt was this that had taken Halsey to the doctor the night he\r\ndisappeared.  He accused the doctor of the deception, and, crossing the\r\nlawn, had said something cruel to Louise.  Then, furious at her\r\napparent connivance, he had started for the station.  Doctor Walker and\r\nPaul Armstrong--the latter still lame where I had shot him--hurried\r\nacross to the embankment, certain only of one thing.  Halsey must not\r\ntell the detective what he suspected until the money had been removed\r\nfrom the chimney-room. They stepped into the road in front of the car\r\nto stop it, and fate played into their hands.  The car struck the\r\ntrain, and they had only to dispose of the unconscious figure in the\r\nroad.  This they did as I have told.  For three days Halsey lay in the\r\nbox car, tied hand and foot, suffering tortures of thirst, delirious at\r\ntimes, and discovered by a tramp at Johnsville only in time to save his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nTo go back to Paul Armstrong.  At the last moment his plans had been\r\nfrustrated.  Sunnyside, with its hoard in the chimney-room, had been\r\nrented without his knowledge!  Attempts to dislodge me having failed,\r\nhe was driven to breaking into his own house.  The ladder in the chute,\r\nthe burning of the stable and the entrance through the card-room\r\nwindow--all were in the course of a desperate attempt to get into the\r\nchimney-room.\r\n\r\nLouise and her mother had, from the first, been the great\r\nstumbling-blocks.  The plan had been to send Louise away until it was\r\ntoo late for her to interfere, but she came back to the hotel at C--\r\njust at the wrong time.  There was a terrible scene.  The girl was told\r\nthat something of the kind was necessary, that the bank was about to\r\nclose and her stepfather would either avoid arrest and disgrace in this\r\nway, or kill himself.  Fanny Armstrong was a weakling, but Louise was\r\nmore difficult to manage.  She had no love for her stepfather, but her\r\ndevotion to her mother was entire, self-sacrificing.  Forced into\r\nacquiescence by her mother's appeals, overwhelmed by the situation, the\r\ngirl consented and fled.\r\n\r\nFrom somewhere in Colorado she sent an anonymous telegram to Jack\r\nBailey at the Traders' Bank.  Trapped as she was, she did not want to\r\nsee an innocent man arrested.  The telegram, received on Thursday, had\r\nsent the cashier to the bank that night in a frenzy.\r\n\r\nLouise arrived at Sunnyside and found the house rented.  Not knowing\r\nwhat to do, she sent for Arnold at the Greenwood Club, and told him a\r\nlittle, not all.  She told him that there was something wrong, and that\r\nthe bank was about to close.  That his father was responsible.  Of the\r\nconspiracy she said nothing.  To her surprise, Arnold already knew,\r\nthrough Bailey that night, that things were not right.  Moreover, he\r\nsuspected what Louise did not, that the money was hidden at Sunnyside.\r\nHe had a scrap of paper that indicated a concealed room somewhere.\r\n\r\nHis inherited cupidity was aroused.  Eager to get Halsey and Jack\r\nBailey out of the house, he went up to the east entry, and in the\r\nbilliard-room gave the cashier what he had refused earlier in the\r\nevening--the address of Paul Armstrong in California and a telegram\r\nwhich had been forwarded to the club for Bailey, from Doctor Walker.\r\nIt was in response to one Bailey had sent, and it said that Paul\r\nArmstrong was very ill.\r\n\r\nBailey was almost desperate.  He decided to go west and find Paul\r\nArmstrong, and to force him to disgorge.  But the catastrophe at the\r\nbank occurred sooner than he had expected.  On the moment of starting\r\nwest, at Andrews Station, where Mr. Jamieson had located the car, he\r\nread that the bank had closed, and, going back, surrendered himself.\r\n\r\nJohn Bailey had known Paul Armstrong intimately.  He did not believe\r\nthat the money was gone; in fact, it was hardly possible in the\r\ninterval since the securities had been taken.  Where was it?  And from\r\nsome chance remark let fall some months earlier by Arnold Armstrong at\r\na dinner, Bailey felt sure there was a hidden room at Sunnyside.  He\r\ntried to see the architect of the building, but, like the contractor,\r\nif he knew of the such a room he refused any information.  It was\r\nHalsey's idea that John Bailey come to the house as a gardener, and\r\npursue his investigations as he could.  His smooth upper lip had been\r\nsufficient disguise, with his change of clothes, and a hair-cut by a\r\ncountry barber.\r\n\r\nSo it was Alex, Jack Bailey, who had been our ghost.  Not only had he\r\nalarmed--Louise and himself, he admitted--on the circular staircase,\r\nbut he had dug the hole in the trunk-room wall, and later sent Eliza\r\ninto hysteria.  The note Liddy had found in Gertrude's scrap-basket was\r\nfrom him, and it was he who had startled me into unconsciousness by the\r\nclothes chute, and, with Gertrude's help, had carried me to Louise's\r\nroom.  Gertrude, I learned, had watched all night beside me, in an\r\nextremity of anxiety about me.\r\n\r\nThat old Thomas had seen his master, and thought he had seen the\r\nSunnyside ghost, there could be no doubt.  Of that story of Thomas',\r\nabout seeing Jack Bailey in the footpath between the club and\r\nSunnyside, the night Liddy and I heard the noise on the circular\r\nstaircase--that, too, was right.  On the night before Arnold Armstrong\r\nwas murdered, Jack Bailey had made his first attempt to search for the\r\nsecret room. He secured Arnold's keys from his room at the club and got\r\ninto the house, armed with a golf-stick for sounding the walls.  He ran\r\nagainst the hamper at the head of the stairs, caught his cuff-link in\r\nit, and dropped the golf-stick with a crash.  He was glad enough to get\r\naway without an alarm being raised, and he took the \"owl\" train to town.\r\n\r\nThe oddest thing to me was that Mr. Jamieson had known for some time\r\nthat Alex was Jack Bailey.  But the face of the pseudo-gardener was\r\nvery queer indeed, when that night, in the card-room, the detective\r\nturned to him and said:\r\n\r\n\"How long are you and I going to play our little comedy, MR. BAILEY?\"\r\n\r\nWell, it is all over now.  Paul Armstrong rests in Casanova churchyard,\r\nand this time there is no mistake.  I went to the funeral, because I\r\nwanted to be sure he was really buried, and I looked at the step of the\r\nshaft where I had sat that night, and wondered if it was all real.\r\nSunnyside is for sale--no, I shall not buy it.  Little Lucien Armstrong\r\nis living with his step-grandmother, and she is recovering gradually\r\nfrom troubles that had extended over the entire period of her second\r\nmarriage. Anne Watson lies not far from the man she killed, and who as\r\nsurely caused her death.  Thomas, the fourth victim of the conspiracy,\r\nis buried on the hill.  With Nina Carrington, five lives were\r\nsacrificed in the course of this grim conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThere will be two weddings before long, and Liddy has asked for my\r\nheliotrope poplin to wear to the church.  I knew she would. She has\r\nwanted it for three years, and she was quite ugly the time I spilled\r\ncoffee on it.  We are very quiet, just the two of us.  Liddy still\r\nclings to her ghost theory, and points to my wet and muddy boots in the\r\ntrunk-room as proof.  I am gray, I admit, but I haven't felt as well in\r\na dozen years.  Sometimes, when I am bored, I ring for Liddy, and we\r\ntalk things over.  When Warner married Rosie, Liddy sniffed and said\r\nwhat I took for faithfulness in Rosie had been nothing but mawkishness.\r\nI have not yet outlived Liddy's contempt because I gave them silver\r\nknives and forks as a wedding gift.\r\n\r\nSo we sit and talk, and sometimes Liddy threatens to leave, and often I\r\ndischarge her, but we stay together somehow.  I am talking of renting a\r\nhouse next year, and Liddy says to be sure there is no ghost.  To be\r\nperfectly frank, I never really lived until that summer.  Time has\r\npassed since I began this story. My neighbors are packing up for\r\nanother summer.  Liddy is having the awnings put up, and the window\r\nboxes filled.  Liddy or no Liddy, I shall advertise to-morrow for a\r\nhouse in the country, and I don't care if it has a Circular Staircase.\r\n\n", "The Case of Jennie Brice": "We have just had another flood, bad enough, but only a foot or two of\r\nwater on the first floor. Yesterday we got the mud shoveled out of the\r\ncellar and found Peter, the spaniel that Mr. Ladley left when he \"went\r\naway\". The flood, and the fact that it was Mr. Ladley's dog whose body\r\nwas found half buried in the basement fruit closet, brought back to me\r\nthe strange events of the other flood five years ago, when the water\r\nreached more than half-way to the second story, and brought with\r\nit, to some, mystery and sudden death, and to me the worst case of\r\n\"shingles\" I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nMy name is Pitman--in this narrative. It is not really Pitman, but\r\nthat does well enough. I belong to an old Pittsburgh family. I was\r\nborn on Penn Avenue, when that was the best part of town, and I lived,\r\nuntil I was fifteen, very close to what is now the Pittsburgh Club. It\r\nwas a dwelling then; I have forgotten who lived there.\r\n\r\nI was a girl in seventy-seven, during the railroad riots, and I recall\r\nour driving in the family carriage over to one of the Allegheny hills,\r\nand seeing the yards burning, and a great noise of shooting from\r\nacross the river. It was the next year that I ran away from school to\r\nmarry Mr. Pitman, and I have not known my family since. We were never\r\nreconciled, although I came back to Pittsburgh after twenty years of\r\nwandering. Mr. Pitman was dead; the old city called me, and I came. I\r\nhad a hundred dollars or so, and I took a house in lower Allegheny,\r\nwhere, because they are partly inundated every spring, rents are\r\ncheap, and I kept boarders. My house was always orderly and clean,\r\nand although the neighborhood had a bad name, a good many theatrical\r\npeople stopped with me. Five minutes across the bridge, and they were\r\nin the theater district. Allegheny at that time, I believe, was\r\nstill an independent city. But since then it has allied itself with\r\nPittsburgh; it is now the North Side.\r\n\r\nI was glad to get back. I worked hard, but I made my rent and my\r\nliving, and a little over. Now and then on summer evenings I went to\r\none of the parks, and sitting on a bench, watched the children playing\r\naround, and looked at my sister's house, closed for the summer. It is\r\na very large house: her butler once had his wife boarding with me--a\r\nnice little woman.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to recall that, at that time, five years ago, I had\r\nnever seen my niece, Lida Harvey, and then to think that only the day\r\nbefore yesterday she came in her automobile as far as she dared, and\r\nthen sat there, waving to me, while the police patrol brought across\r\nin a skiff a basket of provisions she had sent me.\r\n\r\nI wonder what she would have thought had she known that the elderly\r\nwoman in a calico wrapper with an old overcoat over it, and a pair of\r\nrubber boots, was her full aunt!\r\n\r\nThe flood and the sight of Lida both brought back the case of Jennie\r\nBrice. For even then, Lida and Mr. Howell were interested in each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThis is April. The flood of 1907 was earlier, in March. It had been a\r\nlong hard winter, with ice gorges in all the upper valley. Then, in\r\nearly March, there came a thaw. The gorges broke up and began to come\r\ndown, filling the rivers with crushing grinding ice.\r\n\r\nThere are three rivers at Pittsburgh, the Allegheny and the\r\nMonongahela uniting there at the Point to form the Ohio. And all three\r\nwere covered with broken ice, logs, and all sorts of debris from the\r\nupper valleys.\r\n\r\nA warning was sent out from the weather bureau, and I got my carpets\r\nready to lift that morning. That was on the fourth of March, a Sunday.\r\nMr. Ladley and his wife, Jennie Brice, had the parlor bedroom and the\r\nroom behind it. Mrs. Ladley, or Miss Brice, as she preferred to be\r\nknown, had a small part at a local theater that kept a permanent\r\ncompany. Her husband was in that business, too, but he had nothing to\r\ndo. It was the wife who paid the bills, and a lot of quarreling they\r\ndid about it.\r\n\r\nI knocked at the door at ten o'clock, and Mr. Ladley opened it. He\r\nwas a short man, rather stout and getting bald, and he always had a\r\ncigarette. Even yet, the parlor carpet smells of them.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" he asked sharply, holding the door open about an\r\ninch.\r\n\r\n\"The water's coming up very fast, Mr. Ladley,\" I said. \"It's up to the\r\nswinging-shelf in the cellar now. I'd like to take up the carpet and\r\nmove the piano.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come back in an hour or so,\" he snapped, and tried to close the door.\r\nBut I had got my toe in the crack.\r\n\r\n\"I'll have to have the piano moved, Mr. Ladley,\" I said. \"You'd better\r\nput off what you are doing.\"\r\n\r\nI thought he was probably writing. He spent most of the day writing,\r\nusing the wash-stand as a desk, and it kept me busy with oxalic acid\r\ntaking ink-spots out of the splasher and the towels. He was writing a\r\nplay, and talked a lot about the Shuberts having promised to star him\r\nin it when it was finished.\r\n\r\n\"Hell!\" he said, and turning, spoke to somebody in the room.\r\n\r\n\"We can go into the back room,\" I heard him say, and he closed the\r\ndoor. When he opened it again, the room was empty. I called in Terry,\r\nthe Irishman who does odd jobs for me now and then, and we both got to\r\nwork at the tacks in the carpet, Terry working by the window, and I by\r\nthe door into the back parlor, which the Ladleys used as a bedroom.\r\n\r\nThat was how I happened to hear what I afterward told the police.\r\n\r\nSome one--a man, but not Mr. Ladley--was talking. Mrs. Ladley broke\r\nin: \"I won't do it!\" she said flatly. \"Why should I help him? He\r\ndoesn't help me. He loafs here all day, smoking and sleeping, and sits\r\nup all night, drinking and keeping me awake.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice went on again, as if in reply to this, and I heard a rattle\r\nof glasses, as if they were pouring drinks. They always had whisky,\r\neven when they were behind with their board.\r\n\r\n\"That's all very well,\" Mrs. Ladley said. I could always hear her, she\r\nhaving a theatrical sort of voice--one that carries. \"But what about\r\nthe prying she-devil that runs the house?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, for God's sake!\" broke in Mr. Ladley, and after that they spoke\r\nin whispers. Even with my ear against the panel, I could not catch a\r\nword.\r\n\r\nThe men came just then to move the piano, and by the time we had taken\r\nit and the furniture up-stairs, the water was over the kitchen floor,\r\nand creeping forward into the hall. I had never seen the river come up\r\nso fast. By noon the yard was full of floating ice, and at three that\r\nafternoon the police skiff was on the front street, and I was wading\r\naround in rubber boots, taking the pictures off the walls.\r\n\r\nI was too busy to see who the Ladleys' visitor was, and he had gone\r\nwhen I remembered him again. The Ladleys took the second-story front,\r\nwhich was empty, and Mr. Reynolds, who was in the silk department in a\r\nstore across the river, had the room just behind.\r\n\r\nI put up a coal stove in a back room next the bathroom, and managed to\r\ncook the dinner there. I was washing up the dishes when Mr. Reynolds\r\ncame in. As it was Sunday, he was in his slippers and had the colored\r\nsupplement of a morning paper in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with the Ladleys?\" he asked. \"I can't read for\r\ntheir quarreling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Booze, probably,\" I said. \"When you've lived in the flood district as\r\nlong as I have, Mr. Reynolds, you'll know that the rising of the river\r\nis a signal for every man in the vicinity to stop work and get full.\r\nThe fuller the river, the fuller the male population.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then this flood will likely make 'em drink themselves to death!\" he\r\nsaid. \"It's a lulu.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the neighborhood's annual debauch. The women are busy keeping\r\nthe babies from getting drowned in the cellars, or they'd get full,\r\ntoo. I hope, since it's come this far, it will come farther, so the\r\nlandlord will have to paper the parlor.\"\r\n\r\nThat was at three o'clock. At four Mr. Ladley went down the stairs,\r\nand I heard him getting into a skiff in the lower hall. There were\r\nboats going back and forth all the time, carrying crowds of curious\r\npeople, and taking the flood sufferers to the corner grocery, where\r\nthey were lowering groceries in a basket on a rope from an upper\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nI had been making tea when I heard Mr. Ladley go out. I fixed a tray\r\nwith a cup of it and some crackers, and took it to their door. I had\r\nnever liked Mrs. Ladley, but it was chilly in the house with the gas\r\nshut off and the lower floor full of ice-water. And it is hard enough\r\nto keep boarders in the flood district.\r\n\r\nShe did not answer to my knock, so I opened the door and went in.\r\nShe was at the window, looking after him, and the brown valise, that\r\nfigured in the case later, was opened on the floor. Over the foot of\r\nthe bed was the black and white dress, with the red collar.\r\n\r\nWhen I spoke to her, she turned around quickly. She was a tall woman,\r\nabout twenty-eight, with very white teeth and yellow hair, which she\r\nparted a little to one side and drew down over her ears. She had a\r\nsullen face and large well-shaped hands, with her nails long and very\r\npointed.\r\n\r\n\"The 'she-devil' has brought you some tea,\" I said. \"Where shall she\r\nput it?\"\r\n\r\n\"'She-devil'!\" she repeated, raising her eyebrows. \"It's a very\r\nthoughtful she-devil. Who called you that?\"\r\n\r\nBut, with the sight of the valise and the fear that they might be\r\nleaving, I thought it best not to quarrel. She had left the window,\r\nand going to her dressing-table, had picked up her nail-file.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" I said. \"I hope you are not going away. These floods\r\ndon't last, and they're a benefit. Plenty of the people around here\r\nrely on 'em every year to wash out their cellars.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not going away,\" she replied lazily. \"I'm taking that dress\r\nto Miss Hope at the theater. She is going to wear it in _Charlie's\r\nAunt_ next week. She hasn't half enough of a wardrobe to play leads in\r\nstock. Look at this thumb-nail, broken to the quick!\"\r\n\r\nIf I had only looked to see which thumb it was! But I was putting the\r\ntea-tray on the wash-stand, and moving Mr. Ladley's papers to find\r\nroom for it. Peter, the spaniel, begged for a lump of sugar, and I\r\ngave it to him.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Mr. Ladley?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Gone out to see the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope he'll be careful. There's a drowning or two every year in\r\nthese floods.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I hope he won't,\" she said calmly. \"Do you know what I was doing\r\nwhen you came in? I was looking after his boat, and hoping it had a\r\nhole in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't feel that way to-morrow, Mrs. Ladley,\" I protested,\r\nshocked. \"You're just nervous and put out. Most men have their ugly\r\ntimes. Many a time I wished Mr. Pitman was gone--until he went. Then\r\nI'd have given a good bit to have him back again.\"\r\n\r\nShe was standing in front of the dresser, fixing her hair over her\r\nears. She turned and looked at me over her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Probably Mr. Pitman was a man,\" she said. \"My husband is a fiend, a\r\ndevil.\"\r\n\r\nWell, a good many women have said that to me at different times. But\r\njust let me say such a thing to _them_, or repeat their own words\r\nto them the next day, and they would fly at me in a fury. So I said\r\nnothing, and put the cream into her tea.\r\n\r\nI never saw her again.\r\n\nThere is not much sleeping done in the flood district during a spring\r\nflood. The gas was shut off, and I gave Mr. Reynolds and the Ladleys\r\neach a lamp. I sat in the back room that I had made into a temporary\r\nkitchen, with a candle, and with a bedquilt around my shoulders. The\r\nwater rose fast in the lower hall, but by midnight, at the seventh\r\nstep, it stopped rising and stood still. I always have a skiff during\r\nthe flood season, and as the water rose, I tied it to one spindle of\r\nthe staircase after another.\r\n\r\nI made myself a cup of tea, and at one o'clock I stretched out on a\r\nsofa for a few hours' sleep. I think I had been sleeping only an hour\r\nor so, when some one touched me on the shoulder and I started up. It\r\nwas Mr. Reynolds, partly dressed.\r\n\r\n\"Some one has been in the house, Mrs. Pitman,\" he said. \"They went\r\naway just now in the boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it was Peter,\" I suggested. \"That dog is always wandering\r\naround at night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not unless Peter can row a boat,\" said Mr. Reynolds dryly.\r\n\r\nI got up, being already fully dressed, and taking the candle, we went\r\nto the staircase. I noticed that it was a minute or so after two\r\no'clock as we left the room. The boat was gone, not untied, but cut\r\nloose. The end of the rope was still fastened to the stair-rail. I sat\r\ndown on the stairs and looked at Mr. Reynolds.\r\n\r\n\"It's gone!\" I said. \"If the house catches fire, we'll have to drown.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's rather curious, when you consider it.\" We both spoke softly, not\r\nto disturb the Ladleys. \"I've been awake, and I heard no boat come\r\nin. And yet, if no one came in a boat, and came from the street, they\r\nwould have had to swim in.\"\r\n\r\nI felt queer and creepy. The street door was open, of course, and the\r\nlights going beyond. It gave me a strange feeling to sit there in\r\nthe darkness on the stairs, with the arch of the front door like the\r\nentrance to a cavern, and see now and then a chunk of ice slide into\r\nview, turn around in the eddy, and pass on. It was bitter cold, too,\r\nand the wind was rising.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go through the house,\" said Mr. Reynolds. \"There's likely\r\nnothing worse the matter than some drunken mill-hand on a vacation\r\nwhile the mills are under water. But I'd better look.\"\r\n\r\nHe left me, and I sat there alone in the darkness. I had a\r\npresentiment of something wrong, but I tried to think it was only\r\ndiscomfort and the cold. The water, driven in by the wind, swirled at\r\nmy feet. And something dark floated in and lodged on the step below. I\r\nreached down and touched it. It was a dead kitten. I had never known a\r\ndead cat to bring me anything but bad luck, and here was one washed in\r\nat my very feet.\r\n\r\nMr. Reynolds came back soon, and reported the house quiet and in\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\"But I found Peter shut up in one of the third-floor rooms,\" he said.\r\n\"Did you put him there?\"\r\n\r\nI had not, and said so; but as the dog went everywhere, and the door\r\nmight have blown shut, we did not attach much importance to that at\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nWell, the skiff was gone, and there was no use worrying about it until\r\nmorning. I went back to the sofa to keep warm, but I left my candle\r\nlighted and my door open. I did not sleep: the dead cat was on my\r\nmind, and, as if it were not bad enough to have it washed in at my\r\nfeet, about four in the morning Peter, prowling uneasily, discovered\r\nit and brought it in and put it on my couch, wet and stiff, poor\r\nlittle thing!\r\n\r\nI looked at the clock. It was a quarter after four, and except for\r\nthe occasional crunch of one ice-cake hitting another in the yard,\r\neverything was quiet. And then I heard the stealthy sound of oars in\r\nthe lower hall.\r\n\r\nI am not a brave woman. I lay there, hoping Mr. Reynolds would hear\r\nand open his door. But he was sleeping soundly. Peter snarled and ran\r\nout into the hall, and the next moment I heard Mr. Ladley speaking.\r\n\"Down, Peter,\" he said. \"Down. Go and lie down.\"\r\n\r\nI took my candle and went out into the hall. Mr. Ladley was stooping\r\nover the boat, trying to tie it to the staircase. The rope was short,\r\nhaving been cut, and he was having trouble. Perhaps it was the\r\ncandle-light, but he looked ghost-white and haggard.\r\n\r\n\"I borrowed your boat, Mrs. Pitman,\" he said, civilly enough. \"Mrs.\r\nLadley was not well, and I--I went to the drug store.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've been more than two hours going to the drug store,\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe muttered something about not finding any open at first, and went\r\ninto his room. He closed and locked the door behind him, and although\r\nPeter whined and scratched, he did not let him in.\r\n\r\nHe looked so agitated that I thought I had been harsh, and that\r\nperhaps she was really ill. I knocked at the door, and asked if I\r\ncould do anything. But he only called \"No\" curtly through the door,\r\nand asked me to take that infernal dog away.\r\n\r\nI went back to bed and tried to sleep, for the water had dropped an\r\ninch or so on the stairs, and I knew the danger was over. Peter came,\r\nshivering, at dawn, and got on to the sofa with me. I put an end of\r\nthe quilt over him, and he stopped shivering after a time and went to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nThe dog was company. I lay there, wide awake, thinking about Mr.\r\nPitman's death, and how I had come, by degrees, to be keeping a cheap\r\nboarding-house in the flood district, and to having to take impudence\r\nfrom everybody who chose to rent a room from me, and to being called\r\na she-devil. From that I got to thinking again about the Ladleys, and\r\nhow she had said he was a fiend, and to doubting about his having gone\r\nout for medicine for her. I dozed off again at daylight, and being\r\nworn out, I slept heavily.\r\n\r\nAt seven o'clock Mr. Reynolds came to the door, dressed for the store.\r\nHe was a tall man of about fifty, neat and orderly in his habits, and\r\nhe always remembered that I had seen better days, and treated me as a\r\nlady.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind about breakfast for me this morning, Mrs. Pitman,\" he\r\nsaid. \"I'll get a cup of coffee at the other end of the bridge. I'll\r\ntake the boat and send it back with Terry.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned and went along the hall and down to the boat. I heard him\r\npush off from the stairs with an oar and row out into the street.\r\nPeter followed him to the stairs.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter after seven Mr. Ladley came out and called to me: \"Just\r\nbring in a cup of coffee and some toast,\" he said. \"Enough for one.\"\r\n\r\nHe went back and slammed his door, and I made his coffee. I steeped a\r\ncup of tea for Mrs. Ladley at the same time. He opened the door just\r\nwide enough for the tray, and took it without so much as a \"thank\r\nyou.\" He had a cigarette in his mouth as usual, and I could see a fire\r\nin the grate and smell something like scorching cloth.\r\n\r\n\"I hope Mrs. Ladley is better,\" I said, getting my foot in the crack\r\nof the door, so he could not quite close it. It smelled to me as if he\r\nhad accidentally set fire to something with his cigarette, and I tried\r\nto see into the room.\r\n\r\n\"What about Mrs. Ladley?\" he snapped.\r\n\r\n\"You said she was ill last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes! Well, she wasn't very sick. She's better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I bring her some tea?\"\r\n\r\n\"Take your foot away!\" he ordered. \"No. She doesn't want tea. She's\r\nnot here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not here!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens!\" he snarled. \"Is her going away anything to make such\r\na fuss about? The Lord knows I'd be glad to get out of this infernal\r\npig-wallow myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you mean my house--\" I began.\r\n\r\nBut he had pulled himself together and was more polite when he\r\nanswered. \"I mean the neighborhood. Your house is all that could be\r\ndesired for the money. If we do not have linen sheets and double\r\ncream, we are paying muslin and milk prices.\"\r\n\r\nEither my nose was growing accustomed to the odor, or it was dying\r\naway: I took my foot away from the door. \"When did Mrs. Ladley leave?\"\r\nI asked.\r\n\r\n\"This morning, very early. I rowed her to Federal Street.\"\r\n\r\n\"You couldn't have had much sleep,\" I said dryly. For he looked\r\nhorrible. There were lines around his eyes, which were red, and his\r\nlips looked dry and cracked.\r\n\r\n\"She's not in the piece this week at the theater,\" he said, licking\r\nhis lips and looking past me, not at me. \"She'll be back by Saturday.\"\r\n\r\nI did not believe him. I do not think he imagined that I did. He shut\r\nthe door in my face, and it caught poor Peter by the nose. The dog ran\r\noff howling, but although Mr. Ladley had been as fond of the animal as\r\nit was in his nature to be fond of anything, he paid no attention.\r\nAs I started down the hall after him, I saw what Peter had been\r\ncarrying--a slipper of Mrs. Ladley's. It was soaked with water;\r\nevidently Peter had found it floating at the foot of the stairs.\r\n\r\nAlthough the idea of murder had not entered my head at that time, the\r\nslipper gave me a turn. I picked it up and looked at it--a black one\r\nwith a beaded toe, short in the vamp and high-heeled, the sort most\r\nactresses wear. Then I went back and knocked at the door of the front\r\nroom again.\r\n\r\n\"What the devil do you want now?\" he called from beyond the door.\r\n\r\n\"Here's a slipper of Mrs. Ladley's,\" I said. \"Peter found it floating\r\nin the lower hall.\"\r\n\r\nHe opened the door wide, and let me in. The room was in tolerable\r\norder, much better than when Mrs. Ladley was about. He looked at the\r\nslipper, but he did not touch it. \"I don't think that is hers,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"I've seen her wear it a hundred times.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, she'll never wear it again.\" And then, seeing me stare, he\r\nadded: \"It's ruined with the water. Throw it out. And, by the way, I'm\r\nsorry, but I set fire to one of the pillow-slips--dropped asleep, and\r\nmy cigarette did the rest. Just put it on the bill.\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the bed. One of the pillows had no slip, and the ticking\r\ncover had a scorch or two on it. I went over and looked at it.\r\n\r\n\"The pillow will have to be paid for, too, Mr. Ladley,\" I said. \"And\r\nthere's a sign nailed on the door that forbids smoking in bed. If you\r\nare going to set fire to things, I shall have to charge extra.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really!\" he jeered, looking at me with his cold fishy eyes. \"Is there\r\nany sign on the door saying that boarders are charged extra for seven\r\nfeet of filthy river in the bedrooms?\"\r\n\r\nI was never a match for him, and I make it a principle never to bandy\r\nwords with my boarders. I took the pillow and the slipper and went\r\nout. The telephone was ringing on the stair landing. It was the\r\ntheater, asking for Miss Brice.\r\n\r\n\"She has gone away,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean? Moved away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone for a few days' vacation,\" I replied. \"She isn't playing this\r\nweek, is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment,\" said the voice. There was a hum of conversation from\r\nthe other end, and then another man came to the telephone.\r\n\r\n\"Can you find out where Miss Brice has gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see.\"\r\n\r\nI went to Ladley's door and knocked. Mr. Ladley answered from just\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\n\"The theater is asking where Mrs. Ladley is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell them I don't know,\" he snarled, and shut the door. I took his\r\nmessage to the telephone.\r\n\r\nWhoever it was swore and hung up the receiver.\r\n\r\nAll the morning I was uneasy--I hardly knew why. Peter felt it as I\r\ndid. There was no sound from the Ladleys' room, and the house was\r\nquiet, except for the lapping water on the stairs and the police\r\npatrol going back and forth.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o'clock a boy in the neighborhood, paddling on a raft, fell\r\ninto the water and was drowned. I watched the police boat go past,\r\ncarrying his little cold body, and after that I was good for nothing.\r\nI went and sat with Peter on the stairs. The dog's conduct had been\r\nstrange all morning. He had sat just above the water, looking at it\r\nand whimpering. Perhaps he was expecting another kitten or--\r\n\r\nIt is hard to say how ideas first enter one's mind. But the notion\r\nthat Mr. Ladley had killed his wife and thrown her body into the water\r\ncame to me as I sat there. All at once I seemed to see it all:\r\nthe quarreling the day before, the night trip in the boat, the\r\nwater-soaked slipper, his haggard face that morning--even the way the\r\nspaniel sat and stared at the flood.\r\n\r\nTerry brought the boat back at half past eleven, towing it behind\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I said, from the stairs, \"I hope you've had a pleasant\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\"What doing?\" he asked, not looking at me.\r\n\r\n\"Rowing about the streets. You've had that boat for hours.\"\r\n\r\nHe tied it up without a word to me, but he spoke to the dog. \"Good\r\nmorning, Peter,\" he said. \"It's nice weather--for fishes, ain't it?\"\r\n\r\nHe picked out a bit of floating wood from the water, and showing it to\r\nthe dog, flung it into the parlor. Peter went after it with a splash.\r\nHe was pretty fat, and when he came back I heard him wheezing. But\r\nwhat he brought back was not the stick of wood. It was the knife I\r\nuse for cutting bread. It had been on a shelf in the room where I had\r\nslept the night before, and now Peter brought it out of the flood\r\nwhere its wooden handle had kept it afloat. The blade was broken off\r\nshort.\r\n\r\nIt is not unusual to find one's household goods floating around during\r\nflood-time. More than once I've lost a chair or two, and seen it after\r\nthe water had gone down, new scrubbed and painted, in Molly Maguire's\r\nkitchen next door. And perhaps now and then a bit of luck would come\r\nto me--a dog kennel or a chicken-house, or a kitchen table, or even,\r\nas happened once, a month-old baby in a wooden cradle, that lodged\r\nagainst my back fence, and had come forty miles, as it turned out,\r\nwith no worse mishap than a cold in its head.\r\n\r\nBut the knife was different. I had put it on the mantel over the stove\r\nI was using up-stairs the night before, and hadn't touched it since.\r\nAs I sat staring at it, Terry took it from Peter and handed it to me.\r\n\r\n\"Better give me a penny, Mrs. Pitman,\" he said in his impudent Irish\r\nway. \"I hate to give you a knife. It may cut our friendship.\"\r\n\r\nI reached over to hit him a clout on the head, but I did not. The\r\nsunlight was coming in through the window at the top of the stairs,\r\nand shining on the rope that was tied to the banister. The end of the\r\nrope was covered with stains, brown, with a glint of red in them.\r\n\r\nI got up shivering. \"You can get the meat at the butcher's, Terry,\" I\r\nsaid, \"and come back for me in a half-hour.\" Then I turned and went\r\nup-stairs, weak in the knees, to put on my hat and coat. I had made up\r\nmy mind that there had been murder done.\r\n\nI looked at my clock as I went down-stairs. It was just twelve-thirty.\r\nI thought of telephoning for Mr. Reynolds to meet me, but it was his\r\nlunch hour, and besides I was afraid to telephone from the house while\r\nMr. Ladley was in it.\r\n\r\nPeter had been whining again. When I came down the stairs he had\r\nstopped whimpering and was wagging his tail. A strange boat had put\r\ninto the hallway and was coming back.\r\n\r\n\"Now, old boy!\" somebody was saying from the boat. \"Steady, old chap!\r\nI've got something for you.\"\r\n\r\nA little man, elderly and alert, was standing up in the boat, poling\r\nit along with an oar. Peter gave vent to joyful yelps. The elderly\r\ngentleman brought his boat to a stop at the foot of the stairs, and\r\nreaching down into a tub at his feet, held up a large piece of raw\r\nliver. Peter almost went crazy, and I remembered suddenly that I had\r\nforgotten to feed the poor beast for more than a day.\r\n\r\n\"Would you like it?\" asked the gentleman. Peter sat up, as he had been\r\ntaught to do, and barked. The gentleman reached down again, got a\r\nwooden platter from a stack of them at his feet, and placing the\r\nliver on it, put it on the step. The whole thing was so neat and\r\nbusinesslike that I could only gaze.\r\n\r\n\"That's a well-trained dog, madam,\" said the elderly gentleman,\r\nbeaming at Peter over his glasses. \"You should not have neglected\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"The flood put him out of my mind,\" I explained, humbly enough, for I\r\nwas ashamed.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. Do you know how many starving dogs and cats I have found\r\nthis morning?\" He took a note-book out of his pocket and glanced at\r\nit. \"Forty-eight. Forty-eight, madam! And ninety-three cats! I have\r\nfound them marooned in trees, clinging to fences, floating on barrels,\r\nand I have found them in comfortable houses where there was no excuse\r\nfor their neglect. Well, I must be moving on. I have the report of a\r\ncat with a new litter in the loft of a stable near here.\"\r\n\r\nHe wiped his hands carefully on a fresh paper napkin, of which also\r\na heap rested on one of the seats of the boat, and picked up an oar,\r\nsmiling benevolently at Peter. Then, suddenly, he bent over and looked\r\nat the stained rope end, tied to the stair-rail.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I'm going to find out,\" I replied. I glanced up at the\r\nLadleys' door, but it was closed.\r\n\r\nThe little man dropped his oar, and fumbling in his pockets, pulled\r\nout a small magnifying-glass. He bent over, holding to the rail, and\r\ninspected the stains with the glass. I had taken a fancy to him at\r\nonce, and in spite of my excitement I had to smile a little.\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" he said, and looked up at me. \"That's blood. Why did you\r\n_cut_ the boat loose?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't,\" I said. \"If that is blood, I want to know how it got\r\nthere. That was a new rope last night.\" I glanced at the Ladleys' door\r\nagain, and he followed my eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" he said, raising his voice a little, \"if I come into your\r\nkitchen, if you will allow me to fry a little of that liver. There's a\r\nwretched Maltese in a tree at the corner of Fourth Street that won't\r\ntouch it, raw.\"\r\n\r\nI saw that he wanted to talk to me, so I turned around and led the way\r\nto the temporary kitchen I had made.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he said briskly, when he had closed the door, \"there's\r\nsomething wrong here. Perhaps if you tell me, I can help. If I can't,\r\nit will do you good to talk about it. My name's Holcombe, retired\r\nmerchant. Apply to First National Bank for references.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure there _is_ anything wrong,\" I began. \"I guess I'm only\r\nnervous, and thinking little things are big ones. There's nothing to\r\ntell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense. I come down the street in my boat. A white-faced gentleman\r\nwith a cigarette looks out from a window when I stop at the door, and\r\nducks back when I glance up. I come in and find a pet dog, obviously\r\noverfed at ordinary times, whining with hunger on the stairs. As\r\nI prepare to feed him, a pale woman comes down, trying to put a\r\nright-hand glove on her left hand, and with her jacket wrong side out.\r\nWhat am I to think?\"\r\n\r\nI started and looked at my coat. He was right. And when, as I tried to\r\ntake it off, he helped me, and even patted me on the shoulder--what\r\nwith his kindness, and the long morning alone, worrying, and the\r\nsleepless night, I began to cry. He had a clean handkerchief in my\r\nhand before I had time to think of one.\r\n\r\n\"That's it,\" he said. \"It will do you good, only don't make a noise\r\nabout it. If it's a husband on the annual flood spree, don't worry,\r\nmadam. They always come around in time to whitewash the cellars.\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't a husband,\" I sniffled.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me about it,\" he said. There was something so kindly in his\r\nface, and it was so long since I had had a bit of human sympathy, that\r\nI almost broke down again.\r\n\r\nI sat there, with a crowd of children paddling on a raft outside the\r\nwindow, and Molly Maguire, next door, hauling the morning's milk up in\r\na pail fastened to a rope, her doorway being too narrow to admit the\r\nmilkman's boat, and I told him the whole story.\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" he exclaimed, when I had finished. \"It's curious, but--you\r\ncan't prove a murder unless you can produce a body.\"\r\n\r\n\"When the river goes down, we'll find the body,\" I said, shivering.\r\n\"It's in the parlor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why doesn't he try to get away?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is ready to go now. He only went back when your boat came in.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Holcombe ran to the door, and flinging it open, peered into the\r\nlower hall. He was too late. His boat was gone, tub of liver, pile of\r\nwooden platters and all!\r\n\r\nWe hurried to the room the Ladleys had occupied. It was empty. From\r\nthe window, as we looked out, we could see the boat, almost a square\r\naway. It had stopped where, the street being higher, a door-step rose\r\nabove the flood. On the step was sitting a forlorn yellow puppy. As\r\nwe stared, Mr. Ladley stopped the boat, looked back at us, bent over,\r\nplaced a piece of liver on a platter, and reached it over to the dog.\r\nThen, rising in the boat, he bowed, with his hat over his heart, in\r\nour direction, sat down calmly, and rowed around the corner out of\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nMr. Holcombe was in a frenzy of rage. He jumped up and down, shaking\r\nhis fist out the window after the retreating boat. He ran down the\r\nstaircase, only to come back and look out the window again. The police\r\nboat was not in sight, but the Maguire children had worked their raft\r\naround to the street and were under the window. He leaned out and\r\ncalled to them.\r\n\r\n\"A quarter each, boys,\" he said, \"if you'll take me on that raft to\r\nthe nearest pavement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Money first,\" said the oldest boy, holding his cap.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Holcombe did not wait. He swung out over the window-sill,\r\nholding by his hands, and lit fairly in the center of the raft.\r\n\r\n\"Don't touch anything in that room until I come back,\" he called to\r\nme, and jerking the pole from one of the boys, propelled the raft with\r\namazing speed down the street.\r\n\r\nThe liver on the stove was burning. There was a smell of scorching\r\nthrough the rooms and a sort of bluish haze of smoke. I hurried back\r\nand took it off. By the time I had cleaned the pan, Mr. Holcombe was\r\nback again, in his own boat. He had found it at the end of the next\r\nstreet, where the flood ceased, but no sign of Ladley anywhere. He had\r\nnot seen the police boat.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps that is just as well,\" he said philosophically. \"We can't go\r\nto the police with a wet slipper and a blood-stained rope and accuse a\r\nman of murder. We have to have a body.\"\r\n\r\n\"He killed her,\" I said obstinately. \"She told me yesterday he was a\r\nfiend. He killed her and threw the body in the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely. But he didn't throw it here.\"\r\n\r\nBut in spite of that, he went over all the lower hall with his boat,\r\nfeeling every foot of the floor with an oar, and finally, at the back\r\nend, he looked up at me as I stood on the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"There's something here,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI went cold all over, and had to clutch the railing. But when Terry\r\nhad come, and the two of them brought the thing to the surface, it was\r\nonly the dining-room rug, which I had rolled up and forgotten to carry\r\nup-stairs!\r\n\r\nAt half past one Mr. Holcombe wrote a note, and sent it off with\r\nTerry, and borrowing my boots, which had been Mr. Pitman's,\r\ninvestigated the dining-room and kitchen from a floating plank; the\r\ndoors were too narrow to admit the boat. But he found nothing more\r\nimportant than a rolling-pin. He was not at all depressed by his\r\nfailure. He came back, drenched to the skin, about three, and asked\r\npermission to search the Ladleys' bedroom.\r\n\r\n\"I have a friend coming pretty soon, Mrs. Pitman,\" he said, \"a young\r\nnewspaper man, named Howell. He's a nice boy, and if there is anything\r\nto this, I'd like him to have it for his paper. He and I have been\r\nhaving some arguments about circumstantial evidence, too, and I know\r\nhe'd like to work on this.\"\r\n\r\nI gave him a pair of Mr. Pitman's socks, for his own were saturated,\r\nand while he was changing them the telephone rang. It was the theater\r\nagain, asking for Jennie Brice.\r\n\r\n\"You are certain she is out of the city?\" some one asked, the same\r\nvoice as in the morning.\r\n\r\n\"Her husband says so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask him to come to the phone.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is not here.\"\r\n\r\n\"When do you expect him back?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure he is coming back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said the voice angrily, \"can't you give me any\r\nsatisfaction? Or don't you care to?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've told you all I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know where she is?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"She didn't say she was coming back to rehearse for next week's\r\npiece?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her husband said she went away for a few days' rest. He went away\r\nabout noon and hasn't come back. That's all I know, except that they\r\nowe me three weeks' rent that I'd like to get hold of.\"\r\n\r\nThe owner of the voice hung up the receiver with a snap, and left me\r\npondering. It seemed to me that Mr. Ladley had been very reckless. Did\r\nhe expect any one to believe that Jennie Brice had gone for a vacation\r\nwithout notifying the theater? Especially when she was to rehearse\r\nthat week? I thought it curious, to say the least. I went back and\r\ntold Mr. Holcombe, who put it down in his note-book, and together we\r\nwent to the Ladleys' room.\r\n\r\nThe room was in better order than usual, as I have said. The bed was\r\nmade--which was out of the ordinary, for Jennie Brice never made a\r\nbed--but made the way a man makes one, with the blankets wrinkled and\r\ncrooked beneath, and the white counterpane pulled smoothly over the\r\ntop, showing every lump beneath. I showed Mr. Holcombe the splasher,\r\ndotted with ink as usual.\r\n\r\n\"I'll take it off and soak it in milk,\" I said. \"It's his fountain\r\npen; when the ink doesn't run, he shakes it, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Where's the clock?\" said Mr. Holcombe, stopping in front of the\r\nmantel with his note-book in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"The clock?\"\r\n\r\nI turned and looked. My onyx clock was gone from the mantel-shelf.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it seems strange, but from the moment I missed that clock my\r\nrage at Mr. Ladley increased to a fury. It was all I had had left of\r\nmy former gentility. When times were hard and I got behind with the\r\nrent, as happened now and then, more than once I'd been tempted to\r\nsell the clock, or to pawn it. But I had never done it. Its ticking\r\nhad kept me company on many a lonely night, and its elegance had\r\nhelped me to keep my pride and to retain the respect of my neighbors.\r\nFor in the flood district onyx clocks are not plentiful. Mrs. Bryan,\r\nthe saloon-keeper's wife, had one, and I had another. That is, I _had_\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nI stood staring at the mark in the dust of the mantel-shelf, which Mr.\r\nHolcombe was measuring with a pocket tape-measure.\r\n\r\n\"You are sure you didn't take it away yourself, Mrs. Pitman?\" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"Sure? Why, I could hardly lift it,\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe was looking carefully at the oblong of dust where the clock had\r\nstood. \"The key is gone, too,\" he said, busily making entries in his\r\nnote-book. \"What was the maker's name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I don't think I ever noticed.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to me angrily. \"Why didn't you notice?\" he snapped. \"Good\r\nGod, woman, do you only use your eyes to cry with? How can you wind a\r\nclock, time after time, and not know the maker's name? It proves my\r\ncontention: the average witness is totally unreliable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" I snapped, \"I am ordinarily both accurate and\r\nobserving.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" he said, putting his hands behind him. \"Then perhaps you can\r\ntell me the color of the pencil I have been writing with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. Red.\" Most pencils are red, and I thought this was safe.\r\n\r\nBut he held his right hand out with a flourish. \"I've been writing\r\nwith a fountain pen,\" he said in deep disgust, and turned his back on\r\nme.\r\n\r\nBut the next moment he had run to the wash-stand and pulled it out\r\nfrom the wall. Behind it, where it had fallen, lay a towel, covered\r\nwith stains, as if some one had wiped bloody hands on it. He held it\r\nup, his face working with excitement. I could only cover my eyes.\r\n\r\n\"This looks better,\" he said, and began making a quick search of the\r\nroom, running from one piece of furniture to another, pulling out\r\nbureau drawers, drawing the bed out from the wall, and crawling along\r\nthe base-board with a lighted match in his hand. He gave a shout of\r\ntriumph finally, and reappeared from behind the bed with the broken\r\nend of my knife in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Very clumsy,\" he said. \"_Very_ clumsy. Peter the dog could have done\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\nI had been examining the wall-paper about the wash-stand. Among the\r\nink-spots were one or two reddish ones that made me shiver. And seeing\r\na scrap of note-paper stuck between the base-board and the wall, I\r\ndug it out with a hairpin, and threw it into the grate, to be burned\r\nlater. It was by the merest chance there was no fire there. The next\r\nmoment Mr. Holcombe was on his knees by the fireplace reaching for the\r\nscrap.\r\n\r\n\"_Never_ do that, under such circumstances,\" he snapped, fishing among\r\nthe ashes. \"You might throw away valuable--Hello, Howell!\"\r\n\r\nI turned and saw a young man in the doorway, smiling, his hat in his\r\nhand. Even at that first glance, I liked Mr. Howell, and later, when\r\nevery one was against him, and many curious things were developing, I\r\nstood by him through everything, and even helped him to the thing he\r\nwanted more than anything else in the, world. But that, of course, was\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\"What's the trouble, Holcombe?\" he asked. \"Hitting the trail again?\"\r\n\r\n\"A very curious thing that I just happened on,\" said Mr. Holcombe.\r\n\"Mrs. Pitman, this is Mr. Howell, of whom I spoke. Sit down, Howell,\r\nand let me read you something.\"\r\n\r\nWith the crumpled paper still unopened in his hand, Mr. Holcombe took\r\nhis note-book and read aloud what he had written. I have it before me\r\nnow:\r\n\r\n\"'Dog meat, two dollars, boat hire'--that's not it. Here. 'Yesterday,\r\nSunday, March the 4th, Mrs. Pitman, landlady at 42 Union Street, heard\r\ntwo of her boarders quarreling, a man and his wife. Man's name, Philip\r\nLadley. Wife's name, Jennie Ladley, known as Jennie Brice at the\r\nLiberty Stock Company, where she has been playing small parts.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Howell nodded. \"I've heard of her,\" he said. \"Not much of an\r\nactress, I believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"'The husband was also an actor, out of work, and employing his\r\nleisure time in writing a play.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Everybody's doing it,\" said Mr. Howell idly.\r\n\r\n\"The Shuberts were to star him in this,\" I put in. \"He said that the\r\nclimax at the end of the second act--\"\r\n\r\nMr. Holcombe shut his note-book with a snap. \"After we have finished\r\ngossiping,\" he said, \"I'll go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Employing his leisure time in writing a play--'\" quoted Mr. Howell.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. 'The husband and wife were not on good terms. They quarreled\r\nfrequently. On Sunday they fought all day, and Mrs. Ladley told Mrs.\r\nPitman she was married to a fiend. At four o'clock Sunday afternoon,\r\nPhilip Ladley went out, returning about five. Mrs. Pitman carried\r\ntheir supper to them at six, and both ate heartily. She did not see\r\nMrs. Ladley at the time, but heard her in the next room. They were\r\napparently reconciled: Mrs. Pitman reports Mr. Ladley in high good\r\nhumor. If the quarrel recommenced during the night, the other boarder,\r\nnamed Reynolds, in the next room, heard nothing. Mrs. Pitman was up\r\nand down until one o'clock, when she dozed off. She heard no unusual\r\nsound.\r\n\r\n\"'At approximately two o'clock in the morning, however, this Reynolds\r\ncame to the room, and said he had heard some one in a boat in the\r\nlower hall. He and Mrs. Pitman investigated. The boat which Mrs.\r\nPitman uses during a flood, and which she had tied to the stair-rail,\r\nwas gone, having been cut loose, not untied. Everything else was\r\nquiet, except that Mrs. Ladley's dog had been shut in a third-story\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\"'At a quarter after four that morning Mrs. Pitman, thoroughly awake,\r\nheard the boat returning, and going to the stairs, met Ladley coming\r\nin. He muttered something about having gone for medicine for his wife\r\nand went to his room, shutting the dog out. This is worth attention,\r\nfor the dog ordinarily slept in their room.'\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of a dog?\" asked Mr. Howell. He had been listening\r\nattentively.\r\n\r\n\"A water-spaniel. 'The rest of the night, or early morning, was quiet.\r\nAt a quarter after seven, Ladley asked for coffee and toast for one,\r\nand on Mrs. Pitman remarking this, said that his wife was not playing\r\nthis week, and had gone for a few days' vacation, having left early in\r\nthe morning.' Remember, during the night he had been out for medicine\r\nfor her. Now she was able to travel, and, in fact, had started.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Howell was frowning at the floor. \"If he was doing anything wrong,\r\nhe was doing it very badly,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"This is where I entered the case,\" said Mr. Holcombe, \"I rowed into\r\nthe lower hall this morning, to feed the dog, Peter, who was whining\r\non the staircase. Mrs. Pitman was coming down, pale and agitated over\r\nthe fact that the dog, shortly before, had found floating in the\r\nparlor down-stairs a slipper belonging to Mrs. Ladley, and, later, a\r\nknife with a broken blade. She maintains that she had the knife last\r\nnight up-stairs, that it was not broken, and that it was taken from a\r\nshelf in her room while she dozed. The question is, then: Why was the\r\nknife taken? Who took it? And why? Has this man made away with his\r\nwife, or has he not?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Howell looked at me and smiled. \"Mr. Holcombe and I are old\r\nenemies,\" he said. \"Mr. Holcombe believes that circumstantial evidence\r\nmay probably hang a man; I do not.\" And to Mr. Holcombe: \"So, having\r\nfound a wet slipper and a broken knife, you are prepared for murder\r\nand sudden death!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have more evidence,\" Mr. Holcombe said eagerly, and proceeded to\r\ntell what we had found in the room. Mr. Howell listened, smiling to\r\nhimself, but at the mention of the onyx clock he got up and went to\r\nthe mantel.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" he said, and stood looking at the mark in the dust. \"Are\r\nyou sure the clock was here yesterday?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wound it night before last, and put the key underneath. Yesterday,\r\nbefore they moved up, I wound it again.\"\r\n\r\n\"The key is gone also. Well, what of it, Holcombe? Did he brain her\r\nwith the clock? Or choke her with the key?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Holcombe was looking at his note-book. \"To summarize,\" he said,\r\n\"we have here as clues indicating a crime, the rope, the broken knife,\r\nthe slipper, the towel, and the clock. Besides, this scrap of paper\r\nmay contain some information.\" He opened it and sat gazing at it in\r\nhis palm. Then, \"Is this Ladley's writing?\" he asked me in a curious\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nI glanced at the slip. Mr. Holcombe had just read from his note-book:\r\n\"Rope, knife, slipper, towel, clock.\"\r\n\r\nThe slip I had found behind the wash-stand said \"Rope, knife, shoe,\r\ntowel. Horn--\" The rest of the last word was torn off.\r\n\r\nMr. Howell was staring at the mantel. \"Clock!\" he repeated.\r\n\nIt was after four when Mr. Holcombe had finished going over the room.\r\nI offered to make both the gentlemen some tea, for Mr. Pitman had been\r\nan Englishman, and I had got into the habit of having a cup in the\r\nafternoon, with a cracker or a bit of bread. But they refused. Mr.\r\nHowell said he had promised to meet a lady, and to bring her through\r\nthe flooded district in a boat. He shook hands with me, and smiled at\r\nMr. Holcombe.\r\n\r\n\"You will have to restrain his enthusiasm, Mrs. Pitman,\" he said. \"He\r\nis a bloodhound on the scent. If his baying gets on your nerves, just\r\nsend for me.\" He went down the stairs and stepped into the boat.\r\n\"Remember, Holcombe,\" he called, \"every well-constituted murder has\r\ntwo things: a motive and a corpse. You haven't either, only a mass of\r\npiffling details--\"\r\n\r\n\"If everybody waited until he saw flames, instead of relying on the\r\ntestimony of the smoke,\" Mr. Holcombe snapped, \"what would the fire\r\nloss be?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Howell poled his boat to the front door, and sitting down,\r\nprepared to row out.\r\n\r\n\"You are warned, Mrs. Pitman,\" he called to me. \"If he doesn't find a\r\nbody to fit the clues, he's quite capable of making one to fill the\r\ndemand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Horn--\" said Mr. Holcombe, looking at the slip again. \"The tail of\r\nthe 'n' is torn off--evidently only part of a word. Hornet, Horning,\r\nHorner--Mrs. Pitman, will you go with me to the police station?\"\r\n\r\nI was more than anxious to go. In fact, I could not bear the idea of\r\nstaying alone in the house, with heaven only knows what concealed\r\nin the depths of that muddy flood. I got on my wraps again, and Mr.\r\nHolcombe rowed me out. Peter plunged into the water to follow, and had\r\nto be sent back. He sat on the lower step and whined. Mr. Holcombe\r\nthrew him another piece of liver, but he did not touch it.\r\n\r\nWe rowed to the corner of Robinson Street and Federal--it was before\r\nFederal Street was raised above the flood level--and left the boat in\r\ncharge of a boy there. And we walked to the police station. On the way\r\nMr. Holcombe questioned me closely about the events of the morning,\r\nand I recalled the incident of the burned pillow-slip. He made a note\r\nof it at once, and grew very thoughtful.\r\n\r\nHe left me, however, at the police station. \"I'd rather not appear in\r\nthis, Mrs. Pitman,\" he said apologetically, \"and I think better along\r\nmy own lines. Not that I have anything against the police; they've\r\ndone some splendid work. But this case takes imagination, and the\r\npolice department deals with facts. We have no facts yet. What we\r\nneed, of course, is to have the man detained until we are sure of our\r\ncase.\"\r\n\r\nHe lifted his hat and turned away, and I went slowly up the steps to\r\nthe police station. Living, as I had, in a neighborhood where the\r\npolice, like the poor, are always with us, and where the visits of\r\nthe patrol wagon are one of those familiar sights that no amount\r\nof repetition enabled any of us to treat with contempt, I was\r\nuncomfortable until I remembered that my grandfather had been one of\r\nthe first mayors of the city, and that, if the patrol had been at my\r\nhouse more than once, the entire neighborhood would testify that my\r\nboarders were usually orderly.\r\n\r\nAt the door some one touched me on the arm. It was Mr. Holcombe again.\r\n\r\n\"I have been thinking it over,\" he said, \"and I believe you'd better\r\nnot mention the piece of paper that you found behind the wash-stand.\r\nThey might say the whole thing is a hoax.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" I agreed, and went in.\r\n\r\nThe police sergeant in charge knew me at once, having stopped at my\r\nhouse more than once in flood-time for a cup of hot coffee.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, Mrs. Pitman,\" he said. \"I suppose you are still making the\r\nbest coffee and doughnuts in the city of Allegheny? Well, what's the\r\ntrouble in your district? Want an injunction against the river for\r\ntrespass?\"\r\n\r\n\"The river has brought me a good bit of trouble,\" I said. \"I'm--I'm\r\nworried, Mr. Sergeant. I think a woman from my house has been\r\nmurdered, but I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Murdered,\" he said, and drew up his chair. \"Tell me about it.\"\r\n\r\nI told him everything, while he sat back with his eyes half closed,\r\nand his fingers beating a tattoo on the arm of his chair.\r\n\r\nWhen I finished he got up and went into an inner room. He came back in\r\na moment.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to come in and tell that to the chief,\" he said, and led\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\nAll told, I repeated my story three times that afternoon, to the\r\nsergeant, to the chief of police, and the third time to both the\r\nothers and two detectives.\r\n\r\nThe second time the chief made notes of what I said.\r\n\r\n\"Know this man Ladley?\" he asked the others. None of them did, but\r\nthey all knew of Jennie Brice, and some of them had seen her in the\r\ntheater.\r\n\r\n\"Get the theater, Tom,\" the chief said to one of the detectives.\r\n\r\nLuckily, what he learned over the telephone from the theater\r\ncorroborated my story. Jennie Brice was not in the cast that week, but\r\nshould have reported that morning (Monday) to rehearse the next week's\r\npiece. No message had been received from her, and a substitute had\r\nbeen put in her place.\r\n\r\nThe chief hung up the receiver and turned to me. \"You are sure about\r\nthe clock, Mrs. Pitman?\" he asked. \"It was there when they moved\r\nup-stairs to the room?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are certain you will not find it on the parlor mantel when the\r\nwater goes down?\"\r\n\r\n\"The mantels are uncovered now. It is not there.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think Ladley has gone for good?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"He'd be a fool to try to run away, unless--Graves, you'd better get\r\nhold of the fellow, and keep him until either the woman is found or a\r\nbody. The river is falling. In a couple of days we will know if she is\r\naround the premises anywhere.\"\r\n\r\nBefore I left, I described Jennie Brice for them carefully. Asked what\r\nshe probably wore, if she had gone away as her husband said, I had no\r\nidea; she had a lot of clothes, and dressed a good bit. But I recalled\r\nthat I had seen, lying on the bed, the black and white dress with the\r\nred collar, and they took that down, as well as the brown valise.\r\n\r\nThe chief rose and opened the door for me himself. \"If she actually\r\nleft town at the time you mention,\" he said, \"she ought not to be hard\r\nto find. There are not many trains before seven in the morning, and\r\nmost of them are locals.\"\r\n\r\n\"And--and if she did not, if he--do you think she is in the\r\nhouse--or--or--the cellar?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not unless Ladley is more of a fool than I think he is,\" he said,\r\nsmiling. \"Personally, I believe she has gone away, as he says she did.\r\nBut if she hasn't--He probably took the body with him when he said he\r\nwas getting medicine, and dropped it in the current somewhere. But we\r\nmust go slow with all this. There's no use shouting 'wolf' yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--the towel?\"\r\n\r\n\"He may have cut himself, shaving. It _has_ been done.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the knife?\"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders good-naturedly.\r\n\r\n\"I've seen a perfectly good knife spoiled opening a bottle of\r\npickles.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the slippers? And the clock?\"\r\n\r\n\"My good woman, enough shoes and slippers are forgotten in the bottoms\r\nof cupboards year after year in flood-time, and are found floating\r\naround the streets, to make all the old-clothesmen in town happy. I\r\nhave seen almost everything floating about, during one of these annual\r\nfloods.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say you never saw an onyx clock floating around,\" I replied a\r\nlittle sharply. I had no sense of humor that day. He stopped smiling\r\nat once, and stood tugging at his mustache.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he admitted. \"An onyx clock sinks, that's true. That's a very\r\nnice little point, that onyx clock. He may be trying to sell it, or\r\nperhaps--\" He did not finish.\r\n\r\nI went back immediately, only stopping at the market to get meat for\r\nMr. Reynolds' supper. It was after half past five and dusk was coming\r\non. I got a boat and was rowed directly home. Peter was not at the\r\nfoot of the steps. I paid the boatman and let him go, and turned to go\r\nup the stairs. Some one was speaking in the hall above.\r\n\r\nI have read somewhere that no two voices are exactly alike, just as no\r\ntwo violins ever produce precisely the same sound. I think it is what\r\nthey call the timbre that is different. I have, for instance, never\r\nheard a voice like Mr. Pitman's, although Mr. Harry Lauder's in a\r\nphonograph resembles it. And voices have always done for me what odors\r\ndo for some people, revived forgotten scenes and old memories. But the\r\nmemory that the voice at the head of the stairs brought back was not\r\nvery old, although I had forgotten it. I seemed to hear again, all at\r\nonce, the lapping of the water Sunday morning as it began to come in\r\nover the door-sill; the sound of Terry ripping up the parlor carpet,\r\nand Mrs. Ladley calling me a she-devil in the next room, in reply to\r\nthis very voice.\r\n\r\nBut when I got to the top of the stairs, it was only Mr. Howell, who\r\nhad brought his visitor to the flood district, and on getting her\r\nsplashed with the muddy water, had taken her to my house for a towel\r\nand a cake of soap.\r\n\r\nI lighted the lamp in the hall, and Mr. Howell introduced the girl.\r\nShe was a pretty girl, slim and young, and she had taken her wetting\r\ngood-naturedly.\r\n\r\n\"I know we are intruders, Mrs. Pitman,\" she said, holding out her\r\nhand. \"Especially now, when you are in trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have told Miss Harvey a little,\" Mr. Howell said, \"and I promised\r\nto show her Peter, but he is not here.\"\r\n\r\nI think I had known it was my sister's child from the moment I lighted\r\nthe lamp. There was something of Alma in her, not Alma's hardness or\r\nhaughtiness, but Alma's dark blue eyes with black lashes, and Alma's\r\nnose. Alma was always the beauty of the family. What with the day's\r\nexcitement, and seeing Alma's child like this, in my house, I felt\r\nthings going round and clutched at the stair-rail. Mr. Howell caught\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Mrs. Pitman!\" he said. \"What's the matter?\"\r\n\r\nI got myself in hand in a moment and smiled at the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing at all,\" I said. \"Indigestion, most likely. Too much tea the\r\nlast day or two, and not enough solid food. I've been too anxious to\r\neat.\"\r\n\r\nLida--for she was that to me at once, although I had never seen her\r\nbefore--Lida was all sympathy and sweetness. She actually asked me to\r\ngo with her to a restaurant and have a real dinner. I could imagine\r\nAlma, had she known! But I excused myself.\r\n\r\n\"I have to cook something for Mr. Reynolds,\" I said, \"and I'm better\r\nnow, anyhow, thank you. Mr. Howell, may I speak to you for a moment?\"\r\n\r\nHe followed me along the back hall, which was dusk.\r\n\r\n\"I have remembered something that I had forgotten, Mr. Howell,\" I\r\nsaid. \"On Sunday morning, the Ladleys had a visitor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"They had very few visitors.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not see him, but--I heard his voice.\" Mr. Howell did not move,\r\nbut I fancied he drew his breath in quickly. \"It sounded--it was not\r\nby any chance _you_?\"\r\n\r\n\"I? A newspaper man, who goes to bed at three A.M. on Sunday morning,\r\nup and about at ten!\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't say what time it was,\" I said sharply.\r\n\r\nBut at that moment Lida called from the front hall.\r\n\r\n\"I think I hear Peter,\" she said. \"He is shut in somewhere, whining.\"\r\n\r\nWe went forward at once. She was right. Peter was scratching at the\r\ndoor of Mr. Ladley's room, although I had left the door closed and\r\nPeter in the hall. I let him out, and he crawled to me on three legs,\r\nwhimpering. Mr. Howell bent over him and felt the fourth.\r\n\r\n\"Poor little beast!\" he said. \"His leg is broken!\"\r\n\r\nHe made a splint for the dog, and with Lida helping, they put him to\r\nbed in a clothes-basket in my up-stairs kitchen. It was easy to see\r\nhow things lay with Mr. Howell. He was all eyes for her: he made\r\nexcuses to touch her hand or her arm--little caressing touches\r\nthat made her color heighten. And with it all, there was a sort of\r\nhopelessness in his manner, as if he knew how far the girl was out of\r\nhis reach. Knowing Alma and her pride, I knew better than they how\r\nhopeless it was.\r\n\r\nI was not so sure about Lida. I wondered if she was in love with the\r\nboy, or only in love with love. She was very young, as I had been. God\r\nhelp her, if, like me, she sacrificed everything, to discover, too\r\nlate, that she was only in love with love!\r\n\nMr. Reynolds did not come home to dinner after all. The water had got\r\ninto the basement at the store, he telephoned, one of the flood-gates\r\nin a sewer having leaked, and they were moving some of the departments\r\nto an upper floor. I had expected to have him in the house that\r\nevening, and now I was left alone again.\r\n\r\nBut, as it happened, I was not alone. Mr. Graves, one of the city\r\ndetectives, came at half past six, and went carefully over the\r\nLadleys' room. I showed him the towel and the slipper and the\r\nbroken knife, and where we had found the knife-blade. He was very\r\nnon-committal, and left in a half-hour, taking the articles with him\r\nin a newspaper.\r\n\r\nAt seven the door-bell rang. I went down as far as I could on the\r\nstaircase, and I saw a boat outside the door, with the boatman and a\r\nwoman in it. I called to them to bring the boat back along the hall,\r\nand I had a queer feeling that it might be Mrs. Ladley, and that I'd\r\nbeen making a fool of myself all day for nothing. But it was not Mrs.\r\nLadley.\r\n\r\n\"Is this number forty-two?\" asked the woman, as the boat came back.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does Mr. Ladley live here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. But he is not here now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you Mrs. Pittock?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pitman, yes.\"\r\n\r\nThe boat bumped against the stairs, and the woman got out. She was as\r\ntall as Mrs. Ladley, and when I saw her in the light from the upper\r\nhall, I knew her instantly. It was Temple Hope, the leading woman from\r\nthe Liberty Theater.\r\n\r\n\"I would like to talk to you, Mrs. Pitman,\" she said. \"Where can we\r\ngo?\"\r\n\r\nI led the way back to my room, and when she had followed me in, she\r\nturned and shut the door.\r\n\r\n\"Now then,\" she said without any preliminary, \"where is Jennie Brice?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, Miss Hope,\" I answered.\r\n\r\nWe looked at each other for a minute, and each of us saw what the\r\nother suspected.\r\n\r\n\"He has killed her!\" she exclaimed. \"She was afraid he would do it,\r\nand--he has.\"\r\n\r\n\"Killed her and thrown her into the river,\" I said. \"That's what I\r\nthink, and he'll go free at that. It seems there isn't any murder when\r\nthere isn't any corpse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! If he has done that, the river will give her up,\r\neventually.\"\r\n\r\n\"The river doesn't always give them up,\" I retorted. \"Not in\r\nflood-time, anyhow. Or when they are found it is months later, and you\r\ncan't prove anything.\"\r\n\r\nShe had only a little time, being due at the theater soon, but she sat\r\ndown and told me the story she told afterward on the stand:\r\n\r\nShe had known Jennie Brice for years, they having been together in the\r\nchorus as long before as _Nadjy_.\r\n\r\n\"She was married then to a fellow on the vaudeville circuit,\" Miss\r\nHope said. \"He left her about that time, and she took up with Ladley.\r\nI don't think they were ever married.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" I said, jumping to my feet, \"and they came to a respectable\r\nhouse like this! There's never been a breath of scandal about this\r\nhouse, Miss Hope, and if this comes out I'm ruined.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps they were married,\" she said. \"Anyhow, they were always\r\nquarreling. And when he wasn't playing, it was worse. She used to come\r\nto my hotel, and cry her eyes out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew you were friends,\" I said. \"Almost the last thing she said to\r\nme was about the black and white dress of hers you were to borrow for\r\nthe piece this week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Black and white dress! I borrow one of Jennie Brice's dresses!\"\r\nexclaimed Miss Hope. \"I should think not. I have plenty of my own.\"\r\n\r\nThat puzzled me; for she had said it, that was sure. And then I\r\nremembered that I had not seen the dress in the room that day, and I\r\nwent in to look for it. It was gone. I came back and told Miss Hope.\r\n\r\n\"A black and white dress! Did it have a red collar?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I remember it. She wore a small black hat with a red quill with\r\nthat dress. You might look for the hat.\"\r\n\r\nShe followed me back to the room and stood in the doorway while I\r\nsearched. The hat was gone, too.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps, after all, he's telling the truth,\" she said thoughtfully.\r\n\"Her fur coat isn't in the closet, is it?\"\r\n\r\n_It_ was gone. It is strange that, all day, I had never thought of\r\nlooking over her clothes and seeing what was missing. I hadn't known\r\nall she had, of course, but I had seen her all winter in her fur\r\ncoat and admired it. It was a striped fur, brown and gray, and very\r\nunusual. But with the coat missing, and a dress and hat gone, it began\r\nto look as if I had been making a fool of myself, and stirring up a\r\ntempest in a teacup. Miss Hope was as puzzled as I was.\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow, if he didn't kill her,\" she said, \"it isn't because he did\r\nnot want to. Only last week she had hysterics in my dressing-room,\r\nand said he had threatened to poison her. It was all Mr. Bronson, the\r\nbusiness manager, and I could do to quiet her.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at her watch, and exclaimed that she was late, and would\r\nhave to hurry. I saw her down to her boat. The river had been falling\r\nrapidly for the last hour or two, and I heard the boat scrape as it\r\nwent over the door-sill. I did not know whether to be glad that the\r\nwater was going down and I could live like a Christian again, or to be\r\nsorry, for fear of what we might find in the mud that was always left.\r\n\r\nPeter was lying where I had put him, on a folded blanket laid in a\r\nclothes-basket. I went back to him, and sat down beside the basket.\r\n\r\n\"Peter!\" I said. \"Poor old Peter! Who did this to you? Who hurt you?\"\r\nHe looked at me and whined, as if he wanted to tell me, if only he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\n\"Was it Mr. Ladley?\" I asked, and the poor thing cowered close to his\r\nbed and shivered. I wondered if it had been he, and, if it had, why he\r\nhad come back. Perhaps he had remembered the towel. Perhaps he would\r\ncome again and spend the night there. I was like Peter: I cowered and\r\nshivered at the very thought.\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock I heard a boat at the door. It had stuck there, and\r\nits occupant was scolding furiously at the boatman. Soon after I heard\r\nsplashing, and I knew that whoever it was was wading back to the\r\nstairs through the foot and a half or so of water still in the hall. I\r\nran back to my room and locked myself in, and then stood, armed with\r\nthe stove-lid-lifter, in case it should be Ladley and he should break\r\nthe door in.\r\n\r\nThe steps came up the stairs, and Peter barked furiously. It seemed to\r\nme that this was to be my end, killed like a rat in a trap and thrown\r\nout the window, to float, like my kitchen chair, into Mollie Maguire's\r\nkitchen, or to be found lying in the ooze of the yard after the river\r\nhad gone down.\r\n\r\nThe steps hesitated at the top of the stairs, and turned back along\r\nthe hall. Peter redoubled his noise; he never barked for Mr. Reynolds\r\nor the Ladleys. I stood still, hardly able to breathe. The door was\r\nthin, and the lock loose: one good blow, and--\r\n\r\nThe door-knob turned, and I screamed. I recall that the light turned\r\nblack, and that is all I _do_ remember, until I came to, a half-hour\r\nlater, and saw Mr. Holcombe stooping over me. The door, with the lock\r\nbroken, was standing open. I tried to move, and then I saw that my\r\nfeet were propped up on the edge of Peter's basket.\r\n\r\n\"Better leave them up.\" Mr. Holcombe said. \"It sends the blood back to\r\nthe head. Half the damfool people in the world stick a pillow under a\r\nfainting woman's shoulders. How are you now?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" I said feebly. \"I thought you were Mr. Ladley.\"\r\n\r\nHe helped me up, and I sat in a chair and tried to keep my lips from\r\nshaking. And then I saw that Mr. Holcombe had brought a suit case with\r\nhim, and had set it inside the door.\r\n\r\n\"Ladley is safe, until he gets bail, anyhow,\" he said. \"They picked\r\nhim up as he was boarding a Pennsylvania train bound east.\"\r\n\r\n\"For murder?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"As a suspicious character,\" he replied grimly. \"That does as well\r\nas anything for a time.\" He sat down opposite me, and looked at me\r\nintently.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Pitman,\" he said, \"did you ever hear the story of the horse that\r\nwandered out of a village and could not be found?\"\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the best wit of the village failed to locate the horse. But one\r\nday the village idiot walked into town, leading the missing animal by\r\nthe bridle. When they asked him how he had done it, he said: 'Well,\r\nI just thought what I'd do if I was a horse, and then I went and did\r\nit.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" I said, humoring him.\r\n\r\n\"You _don't_ see. Now, what are we trying to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're trying to find a body. Do you intend to become a corpse?\"\r\n\r\nHe leaned over and tapped on the table between us. \"We are trying to\r\nprove a crime. I intend for the time to be the criminal.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked so curious, bent forward and glaring at me from under his\r\nbushy eyebrows, with his shoes on his knee--for he had taken them off\r\nto wade to the stairs--and his trousers rolled to his knees, that I\r\nwondered if he was entirely sane. But Mr. Holcombe, eccentric as he\r\nmight be, was sane enough.\r\n\r\n\"Not _really_ a criminal!\"\r\n\r\n\"As really as lies in me. Listen, Mrs. Pitman. I want to put myself\r\nin Ladley's place for a day or two, live as he lived, do what he did,\r\neven think as he thought, if I can. I am going to sleep in his room\r\nto-night, with your permission.\"\r\n\r\nI could not see any reason for objecting, although I thought it silly\r\nand useless. I led the way to the front room, Mr. Holcombe following\r\nwith his shoes and suit case. I lighted a lamp, and he stood looking\r\naround him.\r\n\r\n\"I see you have been here since we left this afternoon,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Twice,\" I replied. \"First with Mr. Graves, and later--\"\r\n\r\nThe words died on my tongue. Some one had been in the room since my\r\nlast visit there.\r\n\r\n\"He has been here!\" I gasped. \"I left the room in tolerable order.\r\nLook at it!\"\r\n\r\n\"When were you here last?\"\r\n\r\n\"At seven-thirty, or thereabouts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where were you between seven-thirty and eight-thirty?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the kitchen with Peter.\" I told him then about the dog, and about\r\nfinding him shut in the room.\r\n\r\nThe wash-stand was pulled out. The sheets of Mr. Ladley's manuscript,\r\nusually an orderly pile, were half on the floor. The bed coverings had\r\nbeen jerked off and flung over the back of a chair.\r\n\r\nPeter, imprisoned, _might_ have moved the wash-stand and upset the\r\nmanuscript--Peter had never put the bed-clothing over the chair, or\r\nbroken his own leg.\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" he said, and getting out his note-book, he made an exact\r\nmemorandum of what I had told him, and of the condition of the room.\r\nThat done, he turned to me.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Pitman,\" he said, \"I'll thank you to call me Mr. Ladley for the\r\nnext day or so. I am an actor out of employment, forty-one years of\r\nage, short, stout, and bald, married to a woman I would like to be\r\nquit of, and I am writing myself a play in which the Shuberts intend\r\nto star me, or in which I intend the Shuberts to star me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Mr. Ladley,\" I said, trying to enter into the spirit of\r\nthe thing, and, God knows, seeing no humor in it. \"Then you'll like\r\nyour soda from the ice-box?\"\r\n\r\n\"Soda? For what?\"\r\n\r\n\"For your whisky and soda, before you go to bed, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, certainly, yes. Bring the soda. And--just a moment, Mrs. Pitman:\r\nMr. Holcombe is a total abstainer, and has always been so. It is\r\nLadley, not Holcombe, who takes this abominable stuff.\"\r\n\r\nI said I quite understood, but that Mr. Ladley could skip a night, if\r\nhe so wished. But the little gentleman would not hear to it, and when\r\nI brought the soda, poured himself a double portion. He stood looking\r\nat it, with his face screwed up, as if the very odor revolted him.\r\n\r\n\"The chances are,\" he said, \"that Ladley--that I--having a nasty piece\r\nof work to do during the night, would--will take a larger drink than\r\nusual.\" He raised the glass, only to put it down. \"Don't forget,\" he\r\nsaid, \"to put a large knife where you left the one last night. I'm\r\nsorry the water has gone down, but I shall imagine it still at the\r\nseventh step. Good night, Mrs. Pitman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night, Mr. Ladley,\" I said, smiling, \"and remember, you are\r\nthree weeks in arrears with your board.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes twinkled through his spectacles. \"I shall imagine it paid,\"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nI went out, and I heard him close the door behind me. Then, through\r\nthe door, I heard a great sputtering and coughing, and I knew he had\r\ngot the whisky down somehow. I put the knife out, as he had asked me\r\nto, and went to bed. I was ready to drop. Not even the knowledge that\r\nan imaginary Mr. Ladley was about to commit an imaginary crime in the\r\nhouse that night could keep me awake.\r\n\r\nMr. Reynolds came in at eleven o'clock. I was roused when he banged\r\nhis door. That was all I knew until morning. The sun on my face\r\nwakened me. Peter, in his basket, lifted his head as I moved, and\r\nthumped his tail against his pillow in greeting. I put on a wrapper,\r\nand called Mr. Reynolds by knocking at his door. Then I went on to the\r\nfront room. The door was closed, and some one beyond was groaning. My\r\nheart stood still, and then raced on. I opened the door and looked in.\r\n\r\nMr. Holcombe was on the bed, fully dressed. He had a wet towel tied\r\naround his head, and his face looked swollen and puffy. He opened one\r\neye and looked at me.\r\n\r\n\"What a night!\" he groaned.\r\n\r\n\"What happened! What did you find?\"\r\n\r\nHe groaned again. \"Find!\" he said. \"Nothing, except that there was\r\nsomething wrong with that whisky. It poisoned me. I haven't been out\r\nof the house!\"\r\n\r\nSo for that day, at least, Mr. Ladley became Mr. Holcombe again,\r\nand as such accepted ice in quantities, a mustard plaster over his\r\nstomach, and considerable nursing. By evening he was better, but\r\nalthough he clearly intended to stay on, he said nothing about\r\nchanging his identity again, and I was glad enough. The very name of\r\nLadley was horrible to me.\r\n\r\nThe river went down almost entirely that day, although there was still\r\nconsiderable water in the cellars. It takes time to get rid of that.\r\nThe lower floors showed nothing suspicious. The papers were ruined, of\r\ncourse, the doors warped and sprung, and the floors coated with mud\r\nand debris. Terry came in the afternoon, and together we hung the\r\ndining-room rug out to dry in the sun.\r\n\r\nAs I was coming in, I looked over at the Maguire yard. Molly Maguire\r\nwas there, and all her children around her, gaping. Molly was hanging\r\nout to dry a sodden fur coat, that had once been striped, brown and\r\ngray.\r\n\r\nI went over after breakfast and claimed the coat as belonging to Mrs.\r\nLadley. But she refused to give it up. There is a sort of unwritten\r\nlaw concerning the salvage of flood articles, and I had to leave the\r\ncoat, as I had my kitchen chair. But it was Mrs. Ladley's, beyond a\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nI shuddered when I thought how it had probably got into the water.\r\nAnd yet it was curious, too, for if she had had it on, how did it get\r\nloose to go floating around Molly Maguire's yard? And if she had not\r\nworn it, how did it get in the water?\r\n\nThe newspapers were full of the Ladley case, with its curious solution\r\nand many surprises. It was considered unique in many ways. Mr. Pitman\r\nhad always read all the murder trials, and used to talk about the\r\n_corpus delicti_ and writs of _habeas corpus_--_corpus_ being the\r\nlegal way, I believe, of spelling corpse. But I came out of the Ladley\r\ntrial--for it came to trial ultimately--with only one point of law\r\nthat I was sure of: that was, that it is mighty hard to prove a man a\r\nmurderer unless you can show what he killed.\r\n\r\nAnd that was the weakness in the Ladley case. There was a body, but it\r\ncould not be identified.\r\n\r\nThe police held Mr. Ladley for a day or two, and then, nothing\r\nappearing, they let him go. Mr. Holcombe, who was still occupying the\r\nsecond floor front, almost wept with rage and despair when he read the\r\nnews in the papers. He was still working on the case, in his curious\r\nway, wandering along the wharves at night, and writing letters all\r\nover the country to learn about Philip Ladley's previous life, and his\r\nwife's. But he did not seem to get anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers had been full of the Jennie Brice disappearance. For\r\ndisappearance it proved to be. So far as could be learned, she had not\r\nleft the city that night, or since, and as she was a striking-looking\r\nwoman, very blond, as I have said, with a full voice and a languid\r\nmanner, she could hardly have taken refuge anywhere without being\r\ndiscovered. The morning after her disappearance a young woman, tall\r\nlike Jennie Brice and fair, had been seen in the Union Station. But\r\nas she was accompanied by a young man, who bought her magazines and\r\npapers, and bade her an excited farewell, sending his love to various\r\nmembers of a family, and promising to feed the canary, this was not\r\nseriously considered. A sort of general alarm went over the country.\r\nWhen she was younger she had been pretty well known at the Broadway\r\ntheaters in New York. One way or another, the Liberty Theater got\r\na lot of free advertising from the case, and I believe Miss Hope's\r\nsalary was raised.\r\n\r\nThe police communicated with Jennie Brice's people--she had a sister\r\nin Olean, New York, but she had not heard from her. The sister\r\nwrote--I heard later--that Jennie had been unhappy with Philip Ladley,\r\nand afraid he would kill her. And Miss Hope told the same story.\r\nBut--there was no _corpus_, as the lawyers say, and finally the police\r\nhad to free Mr. Ladley.\r\n\r\nBeyond making an attempt to get bail, and failing, he had done\r\nnothing. Asked about his wife, he merely shrugged his shoulders\r\nand said she had left him, and would turn up all right. He was\r\nunconcerned: smoked cigarettes all day, ate and slept well, and looked\r\nbetter since he had had nothing to drink. And two or three days after\r\nthe arrest, he sent for the manuscript of his play.\r\n\r\nMr. Howell came for it on the Thursday of that week.\r\n\r\nI was on my knees scrubbing the parlor floor, when he rang the bell. I\r\nlet him in, and it seemed to me that he looked tired and pale.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mrs. Pitman,\" he said, smiling, \"what did you find in the\r\ncellar when the water went down?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad to say that I didn't find what I feared, Mr. Howell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not even the onyx clock?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not even the clock,\" I replied. \"And I feel as if I'd lost a friend.\r\nA clock is a lot of company.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what I think?\" he said, looking at me closely. \"I\r\nthink you put that clock away yourself, in the excitement, and have\r\nforgotten all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Think hard.\" He was very much in earnest. \"You knew the water was\r\nrising and the Ladleys would have to be moved up to the second floor\r\nfront, where the clock stood. You went in there and looked around to\r\nsee if the room was ready, and you saw the clock. And knowing that the\r\nLadleys quarreled now and then, and were apt to throw things--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but a soap-dish, and that only once.\"\r\n\r\n\"--you took the clock to the attic and put it, say, in an old trunk.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did nothing of the sort. I went in, as you say, and I put up an old\r\nsplasher, because of the way he throws ink about. Then I wound the\r\nclock, put the key under it, and went out.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the key is gone, too!\" he said thoughtfully. \"I wish I could find\r\nthat clock, Mrs. Pitman.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ladley went out Sunday afternoon about three, didn't he--and got back\r\nat five?\"\r\n\r\nI turned and looked at him. \"Yes, Mr. Howell,\" I said. \"Perhaps _you_\r\nknow something about that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I?\" He changed color. Twenty years of dunning boarders has made me\r\npretty sharp at reading faces, and he looked as uncomfortable as if he\r\nowed me money. \"I!\" I knew then that I had been right about the voice.\r\nIt had been his.\r\n\r\n\"You!\" I retorted. \"You were here Sunday morning and spent some time\r\nwith the Ladleys. I am the old she-devil. I notice you didn't tell\r\nyour friend, Mr. Holcombe, about having been here on Sunday.\"\r\n\r\nHe was quick to recover. \"I'll tell you all about it, Mrs. Pitman,\"\r\nhe said smilingly. \"You see, all my life, I have wished for an onyx\r\nclock. It has been my ambition, my _Great Desire_. Leaving the house\r\nthat Sunday morning, and hearing the ticking of the clock up-stairs, I\r\nrecognized that it was an _onyx_ clock, clambered from my boat through\r\nan upper window, and so reached it. The clock showed fight, but after\r\nstunning it with a chair--\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly!\" I said. \"Then the thing Mrs. Ladley said she would not do\r\nwas probably to wind the clock?\"\r\n\r\nHe dropped his bantering manner at once. \"Mrs. Pitman,\" he said, \"I\r\ndon't know what you heard or did not hear. But I want you to give me\r\na little time before you tell anybody that I was here that Sunday\r\nmorning. And, in return, I'll find your clock.\"\r\n\r\nI hesitated, but however put out he was, he didn't look like a\r\ncriminal. Besides, he was a friend of my niece's, and blood is thicker\r\neven than flood-water.\r\n\r\n\"There was nothing wrong about my being here,\" he went on, \"but--I\r\ndon't want it known. Don't spoil a good story, Mrs. Pitman.\"\r\n\r\nI did not quite understand that, although those who followed the trial\r\ncarefully may do so. Poor Mr. Howell! I am sure he believed that it\r\nwas only a good story. He got the description of my onyx clock and\r\nwrote it down, and I gave him the manuscript for Mr. Ladley. That was\r\nthe last I saw of him for some time.\r\n\r\nThat Thursday proved to be an exciting day. For late in the afternoon\r\nTerry, digging the mud out of the cellar, came across my missing gray\r\nfalse front near the coal vault, and brought it up, grinning. And just\r\nbefore six, Mr. Graves, the detective, rang the bell and then let\r\nhimself in. I found him in the lower hall, looking around.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mrs. Pitman,\" he said, \"has our friend come back yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"She was no friend of mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not _she_. Ladley. He'll be out this evening, and he'll probably be\r\naround for his clothes.\"\r\n\r\nI felt my knees waver, as they always did when he was spoken of.\r\n\r\n\"He may want to stay here,\" said Mr. Graves. \"In fact, I think that's\r\njust what he _will_ want.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not here,\" I protested. \"The very thought of him makes me quake.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he comes here, better take him in. I want to know where he is.\"\r\n\r\nI tried to say that I wouldn't have him, but the old habit of the ward\r\nasserted itself. From taking a bottle of beer or a slice of pie,\r\nto telling one where one might or might not live, the police were\r\nautocrats in that neighborhood. And, respectable woman that I am, my\r\nneighbors' fears of the front office have infected me.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Mr. Graves,\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe pushed the parlor door open and looked in, whistling. \"This is the\r\nplace, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. But it was up-stairs that he--\"\r\n\r\n\"I see. Tall woman, Mrs. Ladley?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tall and blond. Very airy in her manner.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded and still stood looking in and whistling. \"Never heard her\r\nspeak of a town named Horner, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Horner? No.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see.\" He turned and wandered out again into the hall, still\r\nwhistling. At the door, however, he stopped and turned. \"Look anything\r\nlike this?\" he asked, and held out one of his hands, with a small\r\nkodak picture on the palm.\r\n\r\nIt was a snap-shot of a children's frolic in a village street, with\r\nsome onlookers in the background. Around one of the heads had been\r\ndrawn a circle in pencil. I took it to the gas-jet and looked at it\r\nclosely. It was a tall woman with a hat on, not unlike Jennie Brice.\r\nShe was looking over the crowd, and I could see only her face, and\r\nthat in shadow. I shook my head.\r\n\r\n\"I thought not,\" he said. \"We have a lot of stage pictures of her, but\r\nwhat with false hair and their being retouched beyond recognition,\r\nthey don't amount to much.\" He started out, and stopped on the\r\ndoor-step to light a cigar.\r\n\r\n\"Take him on if he comes,\" he said. \"And keep your eyes open. Feed him\r\nwell, and he won't kill you!\"\r\n\r\nI had plenty to think of when I was cooking Mr. Reynolds' supper: the\r\nchance that I might have Mr. Ladley again, and the woman at Horner.\r\nFor it had come to me like a flash, as Mr. Graves left, that the\r\n\"Horn--\" on the paper slip might have been \"Horner.\"\r\n\nAfter all, there was nothing sensational about Mr. Ladley's return. He\r\ncame at eight o'clock that night, fresh-shaved and with his hair cut,\r\nand, although he had a latch-key, he rang the door-bell. I knew his\r\nring, and I thought it no harm to carry an old razor of Mr. Pitman's\r\nwith the blade open and folded back on the handle, the way the colored\r\npeople use them, in my left hand.\r\n\r\nBut I saw at once that he meant no mischief.\r\n\r\n\"Good evening,\" he said, and put out his hand. I jumped back, until I\r\nsaw there was nothing in it and that he only meant to shake hands. I\r\ndidn't do it; I might have to take him in, and make his bed, and cook\r\nhis meals, but I did not have to shake hands with him.\r\n\r\n\"You, too!\" he said, looking at me with what I suppose he meant to be\r\na reproachful look. But he could no more put an expression of that\r\nsort in his eyes than a fish could. \"I suppose, then, there is no use\r\nasking if I may have my old room? The front room. I won't need two.\"\r\n\r\nI didn't want him, and he must have seen it. But I took him. \"You may\r\nhave it, as far as I'm concerned,\" I said. \"But you'll have to let the\r\npaper-hanger in to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Assuredly.\" He came into the hall and stood looking around him, and I\r\nfancied he drew a breath of relief. \"It isn't much yet,\" he said, \"but\r\nit's better to look at than six feet of muddy water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or than stone walls,\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me and smiled. \"Or than stone walls,\" he repeated,\r\nbowing, and went into his room.\r\n\r\nSo I had him again, and if I gave him only the dull knives, and locked\r\nup the bread-knife the moment I had finished with it, who can blame\r\nme? I took all the precaution I could think of: had Terry put an extra\r\nbolt on every door, and hid the rat poison and the carbolic acid in\r\nthe cellar.\r\n\r\nPeter would not go near him. He hobbled around on his three legs, with\r\nthe splint beating a sort of tattoo on the floor, but he stayed back\r\nin the kitchen with me, or in the yard.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday night or early Monday morning that Jennie Brice\r\ndisappeared. On Thursday evening, her husband came back. On Friday the\r\nbody of a woman was washed ashore at Beaver, but turned out to be that\r\nof a stewardess who had fallen overboard from one of the Cincinnati\r\npackets. Mr. Ladley himself showed me the article in the morning\r\npaper, when I took in his breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"Public hysteria has killed a man before this,\" he said, when I had\r\nread it. \"Suppose that woman had been mangled, or the screw of the\r\nsteamer had cut her head off! How many people do you suppose would\r\nhave been willing to swear that it was my--was Mrs. Ladley?\"\r\n\r\n\"Even without a head, I should know Mrs. Ladley,\" I retorted.\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \"Let's trust she's still alive, for my\r\nsake,\" he said. \"But I'm glad, anyhow, that this woman had a head.\r\nYou'll allow me to be glad, won't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can be anything you want, as far as I'm concerned,\" I snapped,\r\nand went out.\r\n\r\nMr. Holcombe still retained the second-story front room. I think,\r\nalthough he said nothing more about it, that he was still \"playing\r\nhorse.\" He wrote a good bit at the wash-stand, and, from the loose\r\nsheets of manuscript he left, I believe actually tried to begin a\r\nplay. But mostly he wandered along the water-front, or stood on one\r\nor another of the bridges, looking at the water and thinking. It is\r\ncertain that he tried to keep in the part by smoking cigarettes, but\r\nhe hated them, and usually ended by throwing the cigarette away and\r\nlighting an old pipe he carried.\r\n\r\nOn that Thursday evening he came home and sat down to supper with\r\nMr. Reynolds. He ate little and seemed much excited. The talk ran on\r\ncrime, as it always did when he was around, and Mr. Holcombe quoted\r\nSpencer a great deal--Herbert Spencer. Mr. Reynolds was impressed, not\r\nknowing much beyond silks and the National League.\r\n\r\n\"Spencer,\" Mr. Holcombe would say--\"Spencer shows that every\r\noccurrence is the inevitable result of what has gone before, and\r\ncarries in its train an equally inevitable series of results. Try to\r\ninterrupt this chain in the smallest degree, and what follows? Chaos,\r\nmy dear sir, chaos.\"\r\n\r\n\"We see that at the store,\" Mr. Reynolds would say. \"Accustom a lot of\r\nwomen to a silk sale on Fridays and then make it toothbrushes. That's\r\nchaos, all right.\"\r\n\r\nWell, Mr. Holcombe came in that night about ten o'clock, and I told\r\nhim Ladley was back. He was almost wild with excitement; wanted to\r\nhave the back parlor, so he could watch him through the keyhole, and\r\nwas terribly upset when I told him there was no keyhole, that the\r\ndoor fastened with a thumb bolt. On learning that the room was to\r\nbe papered the next morning, he grew calmer, however, and got the\r\npaper-hanger's address from me. He went out just after that.\r\n\r\nFriday, as I say, was very quiet. Mr. Ladley moved to the back parlor\r\nto let the paper-hanger in the front room, smoked and fussed with\r\nhis papers all day, and Mr. Holcombe stayed in his room, which was\r\nunusual. In the afternoon Molly Maguire put on the striped fur coat\r\nand went out, going slowly past the house so that I would be sure to\r\nsee her. Beyond banging the window down, I gave her no satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock Mr. Holcombe came to my kitchen, rubbing his hands\r\ntogether. He had a pasteboard tube in his hand about a foot long, with\r\nan arrangement of small mirrors in it. He said it was modeled after\r\nthe something or other that is used on a submarine, and that he and\r\nthe paper-hanger had fixed a place for it between his floor and the\r\nceiling of Mr. Ladley's room, so that the chandelier would hide it\r\nfrom below. He thought he could watch Mr. Ladley through it; and as it\r\nturned out, he could.\r\n\r\n\"I want to find his weak moment,\" he said excitedly. \"I want to know\r\nwhat he does when the door is closed and he can take off his mask. And\r\nI want to know if he sleeps with a light.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he does,\" I replied, \"I hope you'll let me know, Mr. Holcombe. The\r\ngas bills are a horror to me as it is. I think he kept it on all last\r\nnight. I turned off all the other lights and went to the cellar. The\r\nmeter was going around.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine!\" he said. \"Every murderer fears the dark. And our friend of the\r\nparlor bedroom is a murderer, Mrs. Pitman. Whether he hangs or not,\r\nhe's a murderer.\"\r\n\r\nThe mirror affair, which Mr. Holcombe called a periscope, was put in\r\nthat day and worked amazingly well. I went with him to try it out, and\r\nI distinctly saw the paper-hanger take a cigarette from Mr. Ladley's\r\ncase and put it in his pocket. Just after that, Mr. Ladley sauntered\r\ninto the room and looked at the new paper. I could both see and hear\r\nhim. It was rather weird.\r\n\r\n\"God, what a wall-paper!\" he said.\r\n\nThat was Friday afternoon. All that evening, and most of Saturday and\r\nSunday, Mr. Holcombe sat on the floor, with his eye to the reflecting\r\nmirror and his note-book beside him. I have it before me.\r\n\r\nOn the first page is the \"dog meat--two dollars\" entry. On the next,\r\nthe description of what occurred on Sunday night, March fourth, and\r\nMonday morning, the fifth. Following that came a sketch, made with a\r\ncarbon sheet, of the torn paper found behind the wash-stand:\r\n\r\nAnd then came the entries for Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Friday\r\nevening:\r\n\r\n6:30--Eating hearty supper.\r\n\r\n7:00--Lights cigarette and paces floor. Notice that when Mrs. P.\r\nknocks, he goes to desk and pretends to be writing.\r\n\r\n8:00--Is examining book. Looks like a railway guide.\r\n\r\n8:30--It is a steamship guide.\r\n\r\n8:45--Tailor's boy brings box. Gives boy fifty cents. Query. Where\r\ndoes he get money, now that J.B. is gone?\r\n\r\n9:00--Tries on new suit, brown.\r\n\r\n9:30--Has been spending a quarter of an hour on his knees looking\r\nbehind furniture and examining base-board.\r\n\r\n10:00--He has the key to the onyx clock. Has hidden it twice, once up\r\nthe chimney flue, once behind base-board.\r\n\r\n10:15--He has just thrown key or similar small article outside window\r\ninto yard.\r\n\r\n11:00--Has gone to bed. Light burning. Shall sleep here on floor.\r\n\r\n11:30--He can not sleep. Is up walking the floor and smoking.\r\n\r\n2:00 A.M.--Saturday. Disturbance below. He had had nightmare and was\r\ncalling \"Jennie!\" He got up, took a drink, and is now reading.\r\n\r\n8:00 A.M.--Must have slept. He is shaving.\r\n\r\n12:00 M.--Nothing this morning. He wrote for four hours, sometimes\r\nreading aloud what he had written.\r\n\r\n2:00 P.M.--He has a visitor, a man. Can not hear all--word now and\r\nthen. \"Llewellyn is the very man.\" \"Devil of a risk--\" \"We'll see you\r\nthrough.\" \"Lost the slip--\" \"Didn't go to the hotel. She went to a\r\nprivate house.\" \"Eliza Shaeffer.\"\r\n\r\nWho went to a private house? Jennie Brice?\r\n\r\n2:30--Can not hear. Are whispering. The visitor has given Ladley roll\r\nof bills.\r\n\r\n4:00--Followed the visitor, a tall man with a pointed beard. He went\r\nto the Liberty Theater. Found it was Bronson, business manager there.\r\nWho is Llewellyn, and who is Eliza Shaeffer?\r\n\r\n4:15--Had Mrs. P. bring telephone book: six Llewellyns in the book; no\r\nEliza Shaeffer. Ladley appears more cheerful since Bronson's visit. He\r\nhas bought all the evening papers and is searching for something. Has\r\nnot found it.\r\n\r\n7:00--Ate well. Have asked Mrs. P. to take my place here, while I\r\ninterview the six Llewellyns.\r\n\r\n11:00--Mrs. P. reports a quiet evening. He read and smoked. Has gone\r\nto bed. Light burning. Saw five Llewellyns. None of them knew Bronson\r\nor Ladley. Sixth--a lawyer--out at revival meeting. Went to the church\r\nand walked home with him. He knows something. Acknowledged he knew\r\nBronson. Had met Ladley. Did not believe Mrs. Ladley dead. Regretted\r\nI had not been to the meeting. Good sermon. Asked me for a dollar for\r\nmissions.\r\n\r\n9:00 A.M.--Sunday. Ladley in bad shape. Apparently been drinking all\r\nnight. Can not eat. Sent out early for papers, and has searched them\r\nall. Found entry on second page, stared at it, then flung the paper\r\naway. Have sent out for same paper.\r\n\r\n10:00 A.M.--Paper says: \"Body of woman washed ashore yesterday at\r\nSewickley. Much mutilated by flood d\u00e9bris.\" Ladley in bed, staring at\r\nceiling. Wonder if he sees tube? He is ghastly.\r\n\r\nThat is the last entry in the note-book for that day. Mr. Holcombe\r\ncalled me in great excitement shortly after ten and showed me the\r\nitem. Neither of us doubted for a moment that it was Jennie Brice who\r\nhad been found. He started for Sewickley that same afternoon, and he\r\nprobably communicated with the police before he left. For once or\r\ntwice I saw Mr. Graves, the detective, sauntering past the house.\r\n\r\nMr. Ladley ate no dinner. He went out at four, and I had Mr. Reynolds\r\nfollow him. But they were both back in a half-hour. Mr. Reynolds\r\nreported that Mr. Ladley had bought some headache tablets and some\r\nbromide powders to make him sleep.\r\n\r\nMr. Holcombe came back that evening. He thought the body was that of\r\nJennie Brice, but the head was gone. He was much depressed, and did\r\nnot immediately go back to the periscope. I asked if the head had been\r\ncut off or taken off by a steamer; he was afraid the latter, as a hand\r\nwas gone, too.\r\n\r\nIt was about eleven o'clock that night that the door-bell rang. It was\r\nMr. Graves, with a small man behind him. I knew the man; he lived in a\r\nshanty-boat not far from my house--a curious affair with shelves\r\nfull of dishes and tinware. In the spring he would be towed up\r\nthe Monongahela a hundred miles or so and float down, tying up at\r\ndifferent landings and selling his wares. Timothy Senft was his name.\r\nWe called him Tim.\r\n\r\nMr. Graves motioned me to be quiet. Both of us knew that behind the\r\nparlor door Ladley was probably listening.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry to get you up, Mrs. Pitman,\" said Mr. Graves, \"but this man\r\nsays he has bought beer here to-day. That won't do, Mrs. Pitman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beer! I haven't such a thing in the house. Come in and look,\" I\r\nsnapped. And the two of them went back to the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Mr. Graves, when I had shut the door, \"where's the\r\ndog's-meat man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Up-stairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring him quietly.\"\r\n\r\nI called Mr. Holcombe, and he came eagerly, note-book and all. \"Ah!\"\r\nhe said, when he saw Tim. \"So you've turned up!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems, Mr. Dog's--Mr. Holcombe,\" said Mr. Graves, \"that you are\r\nright, partly, anyhow. Tim here _did_ help a man with a boat that\r\nnight--\"\r\n\r\n\"Threw him a rope, sir,\" Tim broke in. \"He'd got out in the current,\r\nand what with the ice, and his not knowing much about a boat, he'd\r\nhave kept on to New Orleans if I hadn't caught him--or Kingdom Come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. And what time did you say this was?\"\r\n\r\n\"Between three and four last Sunday night--or Monday morning. He said\r\nhe couldn't sleep and went out in a boat, meaning to keep in close to\r\nshore. But he got drawn out in the current.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did you see him first?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the Ninth Street bridge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you hail him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He saw my light and hailed me. I was making fast to a coal barge\r\nafter one of my ropes had busted.\"\r\n\r\n\"You threw the line to him there?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. He tried to work in to shore. I ran along River Avenue to\r\nbelow the Sixth Street bridge. He got pretty close in there and I\r\nthrew him a rope. He was about done up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you know him again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. He gave me five dollars, and said to say nothing about it.\r\nHe didn't want anybody to know he had been such a fool.\"\r\n\r\nThey took him quietly up stairs then and let him look through the\r\nperiscope. _He identified Mr. Ladley absolutely_.\r\n\r\nWhen Tim and Mr. Graves had gone, Mr. Holcombe and I were left alone\r\nin the kitchen. Mr. Holcombe leaned over and patted Peter as he lay in\r\nhis basket.\r\n\r\n\"We've got him, old boy,\" he said. \"The chain is just about complete.\r\nHe'll never kick you again.\"\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Holcombe was wrong, not about kicking Peter,--although I don't\r\nbelieve Mr. Ladley ever did that again,--but in thinking we had him.\r\n\r\nI washed that next morning, Monday, but all the time I was rubbing and\r\nstarching and hanging out, my mind was with Jennie Brice. The sight of\r\nMolly Maguire, next door, at the window, rubbing and brushing at the\r\nfur coat, only made things worse.\r\n\r\nAt noon when the Maguire youngsters came home from school, I bribed\r\nTommy, the youngest, into the kitchen, with the promise of a doughnut.\r\n\r\n\"I see your mother has a new fur coat,\" I said, with the plate of\r\ndoughnuts just beyond his reach.\r\n\r\n\"Yes'm.\"\r\n\r\n\"She didn't buy it?\"\r\n\r\n\"She didn't buy it. Say, Mrs. Pitman, gimme that doughnut.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, so the coat washed in!\"\r\n\r\n\"No'm. Pap found it, down by the Point, on a cake of ice. He thought\r\nit was a dog, and rowed out for it.\"\r\n\r\nWell, I hadn't wanted the coat, as far as that goes; I'd managed\r\nwell enough without furs for twenty years or more. But it was a\r\nsatisfaction to know that it had not floated into Mrs. Maguire's\r\nkitchen and spread itself at her feet, as one may say. However, that\r\nwas not the question, after all. The real issue was that if it was\r\nJennie Brice's coat, and was found across the river on a cake of ice,\r\nthen one of two things was certain: either Jennie Brice's body wrapped\r\nin the coat had been thrown into the water, out in the current, or she\r\nherself, hoping to incriminate her husband, had flung her coat into\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nI told Mr. Holcombe, and he interviewed Joe Maguire that afternoon.\r\nThe upshot of it was that Tommy had been correctly informed. Joe had\r\nwitnesses who had lined up to see him rescue a dog, and had beheld his\r\nreturn in triumph with a wet and soggy fur coat. At three o'clock\r\nMrs. Maguire, instructed by Mr. Graves, brought the coat to me for\r\nidentification, turning it about for my inspection, but refusing to\r\ntake her hands off it.\r\n\r\n\"If her husband says to me that he wants it back, well and good,\" she\r\nsaid, \"but I don't give it up to nobody but him. Some folks I know of\r\nwould be glad enough to have it.\"\r\n\r\nI was certain it was Jennie Brice's coat, but the maker's name had\r\nbeen ripped out. With Molly holding one arm and I the other, we took\r\nit to Mr. Ladley's door and knocked. He opened it, grumbling.\r\n\r\n\"I have asked you not to interrupt me,\" he said, with his pen in his\r\nhand. His eyes fell on the coat. \"What's that?\" he asked, changing\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\n\"I think it's Mrs. Ladley's fur coat,\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe stood there looking at it and thinking. Then: \"It can't be hers,\"\r\nhe said. \"She wore hers when she went away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps she dropped it in the water.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me and smiled. \"And why would she do that?\" he asked\r\nmockingly. \"Was it out of fashion?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's Mrs. Ladley's coat,\" I persisted, but Molly Maguire jerked it\r\nfrom me and started away. He stood there looking at me and smiling in\r\nhis nasty way.\r\n\r\n\"This excitement is telling on you, Mrs. Pitman,\" he said coolly.\r\n\"You're too emotional for detective work.\" Then he went in and shut\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nWhen I went down-stairs, Molly Maguire was waiting in the kitchen, and\r\nhad the audacity to ask me if I thought the coat needed a new lining!\r\n\r\nIt was on Monday evening that the strangest event in years happened to\r\nme. I went to my sister's house! And the fact that I was admitted at a\r\nside entrance made it even stranger. It happened in this way:\r\n\r\nSupper was over, and I was cleaning up, when an automobile came to the\r\ndoor. It was Alma's car. The chauffeur gave me a note:\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR MRS PITMAN--I am not at all well, and very anxious. Will\r\n    you come to see me at once? My mother is out to dinner, and I am\r\n    alone. The car will bring you. Cordially,\r\n    \"LIDA HARVEY.\"\r\n\r\nI put on my best dress at once and got into the limousine. Half the\r\nneighborhood was out watching. I leaned back in the upholstered seat,\r\nfairly quivering with excitement. This was Alma's car; that was Alma's\r\ncard-case; the little clock had her monogram on it. Even the flowers\r\nin the flower holder, yellow tulips, reminded me of Alma--a trifle\r\nshowy, but good to look at! And I was going to her house!\r\n\r\nI was not taken to the main entrance, but to a side door. The queer\r\ndream-like feeling was still there. In this back hall, relegated from\r\nthe more conspicuous part of the house, there were even pieces of\r\nfurniture from the old home, and my father's picture, in an oval gilt\r\nframe, hung over my head. I had not seen a picture of him for twenty\r\nyears. I went over and touched it gently.\r\n\r\n\"Father, father!\" I said.\r\n\r\nUnder it was the tall hall chair that I had climbed over as a child,\r\nand had stood on many times, to see myself in the mirror above. The\r\nchair was newly finished and looked the better for its age. I glanced\r\nin the old glass. The chair had stood time better than I. I was a\r\nmiddle-aged woman, lined with poverty and care, shabby, prematurely\r\ngray, a little hard. I had thought my father an old man when that\r\npicture was taken, and now I was even older. \"Father!\" I whispered\r\nagain, and fell to crying in the dimly lighted hall.\r\n\r\nLida sent for me at once. I had only time to dry my eyes and\r\nstraighten my hat. Had I met Alma on the stairs, I would have passed\r\nher without a word. She would not have known me. But I saw no one.\r\n\r\nLida was in bed. She was lying there with a rose-shaded lamp beside\r\nher, and a great bowl of spring flowers on a little stand at her\r\nelbow. She sat up when I went in, and had a maid place a chair for me\r\nbeside the bed. She looked very childish, with her hair in a braid on\r\nthe pillow, and her slim young arms and throat bare.\r\n\r\n\"I'm so glad you came!\" she said, and would not be satisfied until the\r\nlight was just right for my eyes, and my coat unfastened and thrown\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not really ill,\" she informed me. \"I'm--I'm just tired and\r\nnervous, and--and unhappy, Mrs. Pitman.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry,\" I said. I wanted to lean over and pat her hand, to draw\r\nthe covers around her and mother her a little,--I had had no one to\r\nmother for so long,--but I could not. She would have thought it queer\r\nand presumptuous--or no, not that. She was too sweet to have thought\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Pitman,\" she said suddenly, \"_who was_ this Jennie Brice?\"\r\n\r\n\"She was an actress. She and her husband lived at my house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was she--was she beautiful?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I said slowly, \"I never thought of that. She was handsome, in\r\na large way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was she young?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Twenty-eight or so.\"\r\n\r\n\"That isn't very young,\" she said, looking relieved. \"But I don't\r\nthink men like very young women. Do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know one who does,\" I said, smiling. But she sat up in bed suddenly\r\nand looked at me with her clear childish eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want him to like me!\" she flashed. \"I--I want him to hate\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tut, tut! You want nothing of the sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Pitman,\" she said, \"I sent for you because I'm nearly crazy. Mr.\r\nHowell was a friend of that woman. He has acted like a maniac since\r\nshe disappeared. He doesn't come to see me, he has given up his work\r\non the paper, and I saw him to-day on the street--he looks like a\r\nghost.\"\r\n\r\nThat put me to thinking.\r\n\r\n\"He might have been a friend,\" I admitted. \"Although, as far as I\r\nknow, he was never at the house but once, and then he saw both of\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"When was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sunday morning, the day before she disappeared. They were arguing\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\nShe was looking at me attentively. \"You know more than you are telling\r\nme, Mrs. Pitman,\" she said. \"You--do you think Jennie Brice is dead,\r\nand that Mr. Howell knows--who did it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think she is dead, and I think possibly Mr. Howell suspects who did\r\nit. He does not _know_, or he would have told the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not think he was--was in love with Jennie Brice, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm certain of that,\" I said. \"He is very much in love with a foolish\r\ngirl, who ought to have more faith in him than she has.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: She sat up in bed suddenly.]\r\n\r\nShe colored a little, and smiled at that, but the next moment she was\r\nsitting forward, tense and questioning again.\r\n\r\n\"If that is true, Mrs. Pitman,\" she said, \"who was the veiled woman\r\nhe met that Monday morning at daylight, and took across the bridge to\r\nPittsburgh? I believe it was Jennie Brice. If it was not, who was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe he took any woman across the bridge at that hour. Who\r\nsays he did?\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Jim saw him. He had been playing cards all night at one of the\r\nclubs, and was walking home. He says he met Mr. Howell face to face,\r\nand spoke to him. The woman was tall and veiled. Uncle Jim sent for\r\nhim, a day or two later, and he refused to explain. Then they forbade\r\nhim the house. Mama objected to him, anyhow, and he only came on\r\nsufferance. He is a college man of good family, but without any money\r\nat all save what he earns.. And now--\"\r\n\r\nI had had some young newspaper men with me, and I knew what they got.\r\nThey were nice boys, but they made fifteen dollars a week. I'm\r\nafraid I smiled a little as I looked around the room, with its gray\r\ngrass-cloth walls, its toilet-table spread with ivory and gold, and\r\nthe maid in attendance in her black dress and white apron, collar and\r\ncuffs. Even the little nightgown Lida was wearing would have taken a\r\nweek's salary or more. She saw my smile.\r\n\r\n\"It was to be his chance,\" she said. \"If he made good, he was to have\r\nsomething better. My Uncle Jim owns the paper, and he promised me to\r\nhelp him. But--\"\r\n\r\nSo Jim was running a newspaper! That was a curious career for Jim to\r\nchoose. Jim, who was twice expelled from school, and who could never\r\nwrite a letter without a dictionary beside him! I had a pang when I\r\nheard his name again, after all the years. For I had written to Jim\r\nfrom Oklahoma, after Mr. Pitman died, asking for money to bury him,\r\nand had never even had a reply.\r\n\r\n\"And you haven't seen him since?\"\r\n\r\n\"Once. I--didn't hear from him, and I called him up. We--we met in the\r\npark. He said everything was all right, but he couldn't tell me just\r\nthen. The next day he resigned from the paper and went away. Mrs.\r\nPitman, it's driving me crazy! For they have found a body, and they\r\nthink it is hers. If it is, and he was with her--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a foolish girl,\" I protested. \"If he was with Jennie Brice,\r\nshe is still living, and if he was _not_ with Jennie Brice--\"\r\n\r\n\"If it was _not_ Jennie Brice, then I have a right to know who it\r\nwas,\" she declared. \"He was not like himself when I met him. He said\r\nsuch queer things: he talked about an onyx clock, and said he had been\r\nmade a fool of, and that no matter what came out, I was always to\r\nremember that he had done what he did for the best, and that--that he\r\ncared for me more than for anything in this world or the next.\"\r\n\r\n\"That wasn't so foolish!\" I couldn't help it; I leaned over and\r\ndrew her nightgown up over her bare white shoulder. \"You won't help\r\nanything or anybody by taking cold, my dear,\" I said. \"Call your maid\r\nand have her put a dressing-gown around you.\"\r\n\r\nI left soon after. There was little I could do. But I comforted her as\r\nbest I could, and said good night. My heart was heavy as I went down\r\nthe stairs. For, twist things as I might, it was clear that in some\r\nway the Howell boy was mixed up in the Brice case. Poor little\r\ntroubled Lida! Poor distracted boy!\r\n\r\nI had a curious experience down-stairs. I had reached the foot of the\r\nstaircase and was turning to go back and along the hall to the side\r\nentrance, when I came face to face with Isaac, the old colored man\r\nwho had driven the family carriage when I was a child, and whom I had\r\nseen, at intervals since I came back, pottering around Alma's house.\r\nThe old man was bent and feeble; he came slowly down the hall, with\r\na bunch of keys in his hand. I had seen him do the same thing many\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nHe stopped when he saw me, and I shrank back from the light, but he\r\nhad seen me. \"Miss Bess!\" he said. \"Foh Gawd's sake, Miss Bess!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are making a mistake, my friend,\" I said, quivering. \"I am not\r\n'Miss Bess'!\"\r\n\r\nHe came close to me and stared into my face. And from that he looked\r\nat my cloth gloves, at my coat, and he shook his white head. \"I sure\r\nthought you was Miss Bess,\" he said, and made no further effort to\r\ndetain me. He led the way back to the door where the machine waited,\r\nhis head shaking with the palsy of age, muttering as he went. He\r\nopened the door with his best manner, and stood aside.\r\n\r\n\"Good night, ma'am,\" he quavered.\r\n\r\nI had tears in my eyes. I tried to keep them back. \"Good night,\" I\r\nsaid. \"Good night, _Ikkie_.\"\r\n\r\nIt had slipped out, my baby name for old Isaac!\r\n\r\n\"Miss Bess!\" he cried. \"Oh, praise Gawd, it's Miss Bess again!\"\r\n\r\nHe caught my arm and pulled me back into the hall, and there he held\r\nme, crying over me, muttering praises for my return, begging me to\r\ncome back, recalling little tender things out of the past that almost\r\nkilled me to hear again.\r\n\r\nBut I had made my bed and must lie in it. I forced him to swear\r\nsilence about my visit; I made him promise not to reveal my identity\r\nto Lida; and I told him--Heaven forgive me!--that I was well and\r\nprosperous and happy.\r\n\r\nDear old Isaac! I would not let him come to see me, but the next\r\nday there came a basket, with six bottles of wine, and an old\r\ndaguerreotype of my mother, that had been his treasure. Nor was that\r\nbasket the last.\r\n\nThe coroner held an inquest over the headless body the next day,\r\nTuesday. Mr. Graves telephoned me in the morning, and I went to the\r\nmorgue with him.\r\n\r\nI do not like the morgue, although some of my neighbors pay it weekly\r\nvisits. It is by way of excursion, like nickelodeons or watching the\r\ncircus put up its tents. I have heard them threaten the children that\r\nif they misbehaved they would not be taken to the morgue that week!\r\n\r\nI failed to identify the body. How could I? It had been a tall woman,\r\nprobably five feet eight, and I thought the nails looked like those of\r\nJennie Brice. The thumb-nail of one was broken short off. I told\r\nMr. Graves about her speaking of a broken nail, but he shrugged his\r\nshoulders and said nothing.\r\n\r\nThere was a curious scar over the heart, and he was making a sketch\r\nof it. It reached from the center of the chest for about six inches\r\nacross the left breast, a narrow thin line that one could hardly see.\r\nIt was shaped like this:\r\n\r\nI felt sure that Jennie Brice had had no such scar, and Mr. Graves\r\nthought as I did. Temple Hope, called to the inquest, said she had\r\nnever heard of one, and Mr. Ladley himself, at the inquest, swore that\r\nhis wife had had nothing of the sort. I was watching him, and I\r\ndid not think he was lying. And yet--the hand was very like Jennie\r\nBrice's. It was all bewildering.\r\n\r\nMr. Ladley's testimoney at the inquest was disappointing. He was cool\r\nand collected: said he had no reason to believe that his wife was\r\ndead, and less reason to think she had been drowned; she had left him\r\nin a rage, and if she found out that by hiding she was putting him in\r\nan unpleasant position, she would probably hide indefinitely.\r\n\r\nTo the disappointment of everybody, the identity of the woman remained\r\na mystery. No one with such a scar was missing. A small woman of\r\nmy own age, a Mrs. Murray, whose daughter, a stenographer, had\r\ndisappeared, attended the inquest. But her daughter had had no such\r\nscar, and had worn her nails short, because of using the typewriter.\r\nAlice Murray was the missing girl's name. Her mother sat beside me,\r\nand cried most of the time.\r\n\r\nOne thing was brought out at the inquest: the body had been thrown\r\ninto the river _after_ death. There was no water in the lungs. The\r\nverdict was \"death by the hands of some person or persons unknown.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Holcombe was not satisfied. In some way or other he had got\r\npermission to attend the autopsy, and had brought away a tracing of\r\nthe scar. All the way home in the street-car he stared at the drawing,\r\nholding first one eye shut and then the other. But, like the coroner,\r\nhe got nowhere. He folded the paper and put it in his note-book.\r\n\r\n\"None the less, Mrs. Pitman,\" he said, \"that is the body of Jennie\r\nBrice; her husband killed her, probably by strangling her; he took the\r\nbody out in the boat and dropped it into the swollen river above the\r\nNinth Street bridge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you think he strangled her?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was no mark on the body, and no poison was found.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then if he strangled her, where did the blood come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't limit myself to strangulation,\" he said irritably. \"He may\r\nhave cut her throat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or brained her with my onyx clock,\" I added with a sigh. For I missed\r\nthe clock more and more.\r\n\r\nHe went down in his pockets and brought up a key. \"I'd forgotten\r\nthis,\" he said. \"It shows you were right--that the clock was there\r\nwhen the Ladleys took the room. I found this in the yard this\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nIt was when I got home from the inquest that I found old Isaac's\r\nbasket waiting. I am not a crying woman, but I could hardly see my\r\nmother's picture for tears.--Well, after all, that is not the Brice\r\nstory. I am not writing the sordid tragedy of my life.\r\n\r\nThat was on Tuesday. Jennie Brice had been missing nine days. In all\r\nthat time, although she was cast for the piece at the theater that\r\nweek, no one there had heard from her. Her relatives had had no word.\r\nShe had gone away, if she had gone, on a cold March night, in a\r\nstriped black and white dress with a red collar, and a red and black\r\nhat, without her fur coat, which she had worn all winter. She had gone\r\nvery early in the morning, or during the night. How had she gone? Mr.\r\nLadley said he had rowed her to Federal Street at half after six and\r\nhad brought the boat back. After they had quarreled violently all\r\nnight, and when she was leaving him, wouldn't he have allowed her to\r\ntake herself away? Besides, the police had found no trace of her on\r\nan early train. And then at daylight, between five and six, my own\r\nbrother had seen a woman with Mr. Howell, a woman who might have been\r\nJennie Brice. But if it was, why did not Mr. Howell say so?\r\n\r\nMr. Ladley claimed she was hiding, in revenge. But Jennie Brice was\r\nnot that sort of woman; there was something big about her, something\r\nthat is found often in large women--a lack of spite. She was not petty\r\nor malicious. Her faults, like her virtues, were for all to see.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the failure to identify the body, Mr. Ladley was arrested\r\nthat night, Tuesday, and this time it was for murder. I know now that\r\nthe police were taking long chances. They had no strong motive for the\r\ncrime. As Mr. Holcombe said, they had provocation, but not motive,\r\nwhich is different. They had opportunity, and they had a lot of\r\nstraggling links of clues, which in the total made a fair chain of\r\ncircumstantial evidence. But that was all.\r\n\r\nThat is the way the case stood on Tuesday night, March the thirteenth.\r\n\r\nMr. Ladley was taken away at nine o'clock. He was perfectly cool,\r\nasked me to help him pack a suit case, and whistled while it was\r\nbeing done. He requested to be allowed to walk to the jail, and went\r\nquietly, with a detective on one side and I think a sheriff's officer\r\non the other.\r\n\r\nJust before he left, he asked for a word or two with me, and when he\r\npaid his bill up to date, and gave me an extra dollar for taking care\r\nof Peter, I was almost overcome. He took the manuscript of his play\r\nwith him, and I remember his asking if he could have any typing done\r\nin the jail. I had never seen a man arrested for murder before, but I\r\nthink he was probably the coolest suspect the officers had ever seen.\r\nThey hardly knew what to make of it.\r\n\r\nMr. Reynolds and I had a cup of tea after all the excitement, and were\r\nsitting at the dining-room table drinking it, when the bell rang. It\r\nwas Mr. Howell! He half staggered into the hall when I opened the\r\ndoor, and was for going into the parlor bedroom without a word.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Ladley's gone, if you want him,\" I said. I thought his face\r\ncleared.\r\n\r\n\"Gone!\" he said. \"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"To jail.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not reply at once. He stood there, tapping the palm of one\r\nhand with the forefinger of the other. He was dirty and unshaven. His\r\nclothes looked as if he had been sleeping in them.\r\n\r\n\"So they've got him!\" he muttered finally, and turning, was about to\r\ngo out the front door without another word, but I caught his arm.\r\n\r\n\"You're sick, Mr. Howell,\" I said. \"You'd better not go out just yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm all right.\" He took his handkerchief out and wiped his face.\r\nI saw that his hands were shaking.\r\n\r\n\"Come back and have a cup of tea, and a slice of home-made bread.\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated and looked at his watch. \"I'll do it, Mrs. Pitman,\" he\r\nsaid. \"I suppose I'd better throw a little fuel into this engine of\r\nmine. It's been going hard for several days.\"\r\n\r\nHe ate like a wolf. I cut half a loaf into slices for him, and he\r\ndrank the rest of the tea. Mr. Reynolds creaked up to bed and left him\r\nstill eating, and me still cutting and spreading. Now that I had a\r\nchance to see him, I was shocked. The rims of his eyes were red, his\r\ncollar was black, and his hair hung over his forehead. But when he\r\nfinally sat back and looked at me, his color was better.\r\n\r\n\"So they've canned him!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Time enough, too,\" said I.\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward and put both his elbows on the table. \"Mrs. Pitman,\"\r\nhe said earnestly, \"I don't like him any more than you do. But he\r\nnever killed that woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Somebody killed her.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know? How do you know she is dead?\"\r\n\r\nWell, I didn't, of course--I only felt it.\r\n\r\n\"The police haven't even proved a crime. They can't hold a man for a\r\nsupposititious murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they can't but they're doing it,\" I retorted. \"If the woman's\r\nalive, she won't let him hang.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not so sure of that,\" he said heavily, and got up. He looked in\r\nthe little mirror over the sideboard, and brushed back his hair. \"I\r\nlook bad enough,\" he said, \"but I feel worse. Well, you've saved my\r\nlife, Mrs. Pitman. Thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is my--how is Miss Harvey?\" I asked, as we started out. He turned\r\nand smiled at me in his boyish way.\r\n\r\n\"The best ever!\" he said. \"I haven't seen her for days, and it seems\r\nlike centuries. She--she is the only girl in the world for me, Mrs.\r\nPitman, although I--\" He stopped and drew a long breath. \"She is\r\nbeautiful, isn't she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very beautiful,\" I answered. \"Her mother was always--\"\r\n\r\n\"Her mother!\" He looked at me curiously.\r\n\r\n\"I knew her mother years ago,\" I said, putting the best face on my\r\nmistake that I could.\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll remember you to her, if she ever allows me to see her\r\nagain. Just now I'm _persona non grata_.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you'll do the kindly thing, Mr. Howell,\" I said, \"you'll _forget_\r\nme to her.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked into my eyes and then thrust out his hand.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he said. \"I'll not ask any questions. I guess there are\r\nsome curious stories hidden in these old houses.\"\r\n\r\nPeter hobbled to the front door with him. He had not gone so far as\r\nthe parlor once while Mr. Ladley was in the house.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey had had a sale of spring flowers at the store that day, and Mr.\r\nReynolds had brought me a pot of white tulips. That night I hung my\r\nmother's picture over the mantel in the dining-room, and put the\r\ntulips beneath it. It gave me a feeling of comfort; I had never seen\r\nmy mother's grave, or put flowers on it.\r\n\nI have said before that I do not know anything about the law. I\r\nbelieve that the Ladley case was unusual, in several ways. Mr. Ladley\r\nhad once been well known in New York among the people who frequent the\r\ntheaters, and Jennie Brice was even better known. A good many lawyers,\r\nI believe, said that the police had not a leg to stand on, and I know\r\nthe case was watched with much interest by the legal profession.\r\nPeople wrote letters to the newspapers, protesting against Mr. Ladley\r\nbeing held. And I believe that the district attorney, in taking him\r\nbefore the grand jury, hardly hoped to make a case.\r\n\r\nBut he did, to his own surprise, I fancy, and the trial was set for\r\nMay. But in the meantime, many curious things happened.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the week following Mr. Ladley's arrest my house\r\nwas filled up with eight or ten members of a company from the Gaiety\r\nTheater, very cheerful and jolly, and well behaved. Three men, I\r\nthink, and the rest girls. One of the men was named Bellows, John\r\nBellows, and it turned out that he had known Jennie Brice very well.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment he learned that, Mr. Holcombe hardly left him. He\r\nwalked to the theater with him and waited to walk home again. He took\r\nhim out to restaurants and for long street-car rides in the mornings,\r\nand on the last night of their stay, Saturday, they got gloriously\r\ndrunk together--Mr. Holcombe, no doubt, in his character of\r\nLadley--and came reeling in at three in the morning, singing. Mr.\r\nHolcombe was very sick the next day, but by Monday he was all right,\r\nand he called me into the room.\r\n\r\n\"We've got him, Mrs. Pitman,\" he said, looking mottled but cheerful.\r\n\"As sure as God made little fishes, we've got him.\" That was all he\r\nwould say, however. It seemed he was going to New York, and might be\r\ngone for a month. \"I've no family,\" he said, \"and enough money to keep\r\nme. If I find my relaxation in hunting down criminals, it's a harmless\r\nand cheap amusement, and--it's my own business.\"\r\n\r\nHe went away that night, and I must admit I missed him. I rented the\r\nparlor bedroom the next day to a school-teacher, and I found the\r\nperiscope affair very handy. I could see just how much gas she used;\r\nand although the notice on each door forbids cooking and washing in\r\nrooms, I found she was doing both: making coffee and boiling an egg\r\nin the morning, and rubbing out stockings and handkerchiefs in her\r\nwash-bowl. I'd much rather have men as boarders than women. The women\r\nare always lighting alcohol lamps on the bureau, and wanting the bed\r\nturned into a cozy corner so they can see their gentlemen friends in\r\ntheir rooms.\r\n\r\nWell, with Mr. Holcombe gone, and Mr. Reynolds busy all day and half\r\nthe night getting out the summer silks and preparing for remnant day,\r\nand with Mr. Ladley in jail and Lida out of the city--for I saw in\r\nthe papers that she was not well, and her mother had taken her to\r\nBermuda--I had a good bit of time on my hands. And so I got in the\r\nhabit of thinking things over, and trying to draw conclusions, as I\r\nhad seen Mr. Holcombe do. I would sit down and write things out as\r\nthey had happened, and study them over, and especially I worried over\r\nhow we could have found a slip of paper in Mr. Ladley's room with a\r\nlist, almost exact, of the things we had discovered there. I used to\r\nread it over, \"rope, knife, shoe, towel, Horn--\" and get more and more\r\nbewildered. \"Horn\"--might have been a town, or it might not have been.\r\nThere _was_ such a town, according to Mr. Graves, but apparently he\r\nhad made nothing of it. _Was_ it a town that was meant?\r\n\r\nThe dictionary gave only a few words beginning with \"horn\"--hornet,\r\nhornblende, hornpipe, and horny--none of which was of any assistance.\r\nAnd then one morning I happened to see in the personal column of one\r\nof the newspapers that a woman named Eliza Shaeffer, of Horner, had\r\nday-old Buff Orpington and Plymouth Rock chicks for sale, and it\r\nstarted me to puzzling again. Perhaps it had been Horner, and possibly\r\nthis very Eliza Shaeffer--\r\n\r\nI suppose my lack of experience was in my favor, for, after all, Eliza\r\nShaeffer is a common enough name, and the \"Horn\" might have stood for\r\n\"hornswoggle,\" for all I knew. The story of the man who thought of\r\nwhat he would do if he were a horse, came back to me, and for an hour\r\nor so I tried to think I was Jennie Brice, trying to get away and hide\r\nfrom my rascal of a husband. But I made no headway. I would never have\r\ngone to Horner, or to any small town, if I had wanted to hide. I\r\nthink I should have gone around the corner and taken a room in my own\r\nneighborhood, or have lost myself in some large city.\r\n\r\nIt was that same day that, since I did not go to Horner, Horner came\r\nto me. The bell rang about three o'clock, and I answered it myself.\r\nFor, with times hard and only two or three roomers all winter, I had\r\nnot had a servant, except Terry to do odd jobs, for some months.\r\n\r\nThere stood a fresh-faced young girl, with a covered basket in her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"Are you Mrs. Pitman?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I don't need anything to-day,\" I said, trying to shut the door. And\r\nat that minute something in the basket cheeped. Young women selling\r\npoultry are not common in our neighborhood. \"What have you there?\" I\r\nasked more agreeably.\r\n\r\n\"Chicks, day-old chicks, but I'm not trying to sell you any. I--may I\r\ncome in?\"\r\n\r\nIt was dawning on me then that perhaps this was Eliza Shaeffer. I led\r\nher back to the dining-room, with Peter sniffing at the basket.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Shaeffer,\" she said. \"I've seen your name in the papers,\r\nand I believe I know something about Jennie Brice.\"\r\n\r\nEliza Shaeffer's story was curious. She said that she was postmistress\r\nat Horner, and lived with her mother on a farm a mile out of the town,\r\ndriving in and out each day in a buggy.\r\n\r\nOn Monday afternoon, March the fifth, a woman had alighted at the\r\nstation from a train, and had taken luncheon at the hotel. She\r\ntold the clerk she was on the road, selling corsets, and was much\r\ndisappointed to find no store of any size in the town. The woman, who\r\nhad registered as Mrs. Jane Bellows, said she was tired and would like\r\nto rest for a day or two on a farm. She was told to see Eliza Shaeffer\r\nat the post-office, and, as a result, drove out with her to the farm\r\nafter the last mail came in that evening.\r\n\r\nAsked to describe her--she was over medium height, light-haired, quick\r\nin her movements, and wore a black and white striped dress with a red\r\ncollar, and a hat to match. She carried a small brown valise that Miss\r\nShaeffer presumed contained her samples.\r\n\r\nMrs. Shaeffer had made her welcome, although they did not usually take\r\nboarders until June. She had not eaten much supper, and that night she\r\nhad asked for pen and ink, and had written a letter. The letter was\r\nnot mailed until Wednesday. All of Tuesday Mrs. Bellows had spent in\r\nher room, and Mrs. Shaeffer had driven to the village in the afternoon\r\nwith word that she had been crying all day, and bought some headache\r\nmedicine for her.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, however, she had appeared at breakfast, eaten\r\nheartily, and had asked Miss Shaeffer to take her letter to the\r\npost-office. It was addressed to Mr. Ellis Howell, in care of a\r\nPittsburgh newspaper!\r\n\r\nThat night when Miss Eliza went home, about half past eight, the woman\r\nwas gone. She had paid for her room and had been driven as far as\r\nThornville, where all trace of her had been lost. On account of the\r\ndisappearance of Jennie Brice being published shortly after that, she\r\nand her mother had driven to Thornville, but the station agent there\r\nwas surly as well as stupid. They had learned nothing about the woman.\r\n\r\nSince that time, three men had made inquiries about the woman in\r\nquestion. One had a pointed Vandyke beard; the second, from the\r\ndescription, I fancied must have been Mr. Graves. The third without\r\ndoubt was Mr. Howell. Eliza Shaeffer said that this last man had\r\nseemed half frantic. I brought her a photograph of Jennie Brice as\r\n\"Topsy\" and another one as \"Juliet\". She said there was a resemblance,\r\nbut that it ended there. But of course, as Mr. Graves had said, by the\r\ntime an actress gets her photograph retouched to suit her, it doesn't\r\nparticularly resemble her. And unless I had known Jennie Brice myself,\r\nI should hardly have recognized the pictures.\r\n\r\nWell, in spite of all that, there seemed no doubt that Jennie Brice\r\nhad been living three days after her disappearance, and that would\r\nclear Mr. Ladley. But what had Mr. Howell to do with it all? Why had\r\nhe not told the police of the letter from Horner? Or about the woman\r\non the bridge? Why had Mr. Bronson, who was likely the man with the\r\npointed beard, said nothing about having traced Jennie Brice to\r\nHorner?\r\n\r\nI did as I thought Mr. Holcombe would have wished me to do. I wrote\r\ndown on a clean sheet of note-paper all that Eliza Shaeffer said: the\r\ndescription of the black and white dress, the woman's height, and the\r\nrest, and then I took her to the court-house, chicks and all, and she\r\ntold her story there to one of the assistant district attorneys.\r\n\r\nThe young man was interested, but not convinced. He had her story\r\ntaken down, and she signed it. He was smiling as he bowed us out. I\r\nturned in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"This will free Mr. Ladley, I suppose?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not just yet,\" he said pleasantly. \"This makes just eleven places\r\nwhere Jennie Brice spent the first three days after her death.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I can positively identify the dress.\"\r\n\r\n\"My good woman, that dress has been described, to the last stilted\r\narch and Colonial volute, in every newspaper in the United States!\"\r\n\r\nThat evening the newspapers announced that during a conference at the\r\njail between Mr. Ladley and James Bronson, business manager at the\r\nLiberty Theater, Mr. Ladley had attacked Mr. Bronson with a chair, and\r\nalmost brained him.\r\n\nEliza Shaeffer went back to Horner, after delivering her chicks\r\nsomewhere in the city. Things went on as before. The trial was set for\r\nMay. The district attorney's office had all the things we had found in\r\nthe house that Monday afternoon--the stained towel, the broken knife\r\nand its blade, the slipper that had been floating in the parlor,\r\nand the rope that had fastened my boat to the staircase.\r\nSomewhere--wherever they keep such things--was the headless body of\r\na woman with a hand missing, and with a curious scar across the left\r\nbreast. The slip of paper, however, which I had found behind the\r\nbase-board, was still in Mr. Holcombe's possession, nor had he\r\nmentioned it to the police.\r\n\r\nMr. Holcombe had not come back. He wrote me twice asking me to hold\r\nhis room, once from New York and once from Chicago. To the second\r\nletter he added a postscript:\r\n\r\n    \"Have not found what I wanted, but am getting warm. If any news,\r\n    address me at Des Moines, Iowa, General Delivery.    H.\"\r\n\r\nIt was nearly the end of April when I saw Lida again. I had seen by\r\nthe newspapers that she and her mother were coming home. I wondered if\r\nshe had heard from Mr. Howell, for I had not, and I wondered, too, if\r\nshe would send for me again.\r\n\r\nBut she came herself, on foot, late one afternoon, and the\r\nschool-teacher being out, I took her into the parlor bedroom. She\r\nlooked thinner than before, and rather white. My heart ached for her.\r\n\r\n\"I have been away,\" she explained. \"I thought you might wonder why\r\nyou did not hear from me. But, you see, my mother--\" she stopped\r\nand flushed. \"I would have written you from Bermuda, but--my mother\r\nwatched my correspondence, so I could not.\"\r\n\r\nNo. I knew she could not. Alma had once found a letter of mine to Mr.\r\nPitman. Very little escaped Alma.\r\n\r\n\"I wondered if you have heard anything?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard nothing. Mr. Howell was here once, just after I saw you.\r\nI do not believe he is in the city.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not, although--Mrs. Pitman, I believe he is in the city,\r\nhiding!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hiding! Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. But last night I thought I saw him below my window. I\r\nopened the window, so if it were he, he could make some sign. But he\r\nmoved on without a word. Later, whoever it was came back. I put out my\r\nlight and watched. Some one stood there, in the shadow, until after\r\ntwo this morning. Part of the time he was looking up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think, had it been he, he would have spoken when he saw\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"He is in trouble,\" she said. \"He has not heard\r\nfrom me, and he--thinks I don't care any more. Just look at me, Mrs.\r\nPitman! Do I look as if I don't care?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked half killed, poor lamb.\r\n\r\n\"He may be out of town, searching for a better position,\" I tried to\r\ncomfort her. \"He wants to have something to offer more than himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I only want him,\" she said, looking at me frankly. \"I don't know why\r\nI tell you all this, but you are so kind, and I _must_ talk to some\r\none.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat there, in the cozy corner the school-teacher had made with a\r\nporti\u00e8re and some cushions, and I saw she was about ready to break\r\ndown and cry. I went over to her and took her hand, for she was my own\r\nniece, although she didn't suspect it, and I had never had a child of\r\nmy own.\r\n\r\nBut after all, I could not help her much. I could only assure her that\r\nhe would come back and explain everything, and that he was all right,\r\nand that the last time I had seen him he had spoken of her, and had\r\nsaid she was \"the best ever.\" My heart fairly yearned over the girl,\r\nand I think she felt it. For she kissed me, shyly, when she was\r\nleaving.\r\n\r\nWith the newspaper files before me, it is not hard to give the details\r\nof that sensational trial. It commenced on Monday, the seventh of May,\r\nbut it was late Wednesday when the jury was finally selected. I was at\r\nthe court-house early on Thursday, and so was Mr. Reynolds.\r\n\r\nThe district attorney made a short speech. \"We propose, gentlemen, to\r\nprove that the prisoner, Philip Ladley, murdered his wife,\" he said\r\nin part. \"We will show first that a crime was committed; then we will\r\nshow a motive for this crime, and, finally, we expect to show that the\r\nbody washed ashore at Sewickley is the body of the murdered woman, and\r\nthus establish beyond doubt the prisoner's guilt.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ladley listened with attention. He wore the brown suit, and looked\r\nwell and cheerful. He was much more like a spectator than a prisoner,\r\nand he was not so nervous as I was.\r\n\r\nOf that first day I do not recall much. I was called early in the day.\r\nThe district attorney questioned me.\r\n\r\n\"Your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Elizabeth Marie Pitman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your occupation?\"\r\n\r\n\"I keep a boarding-house at 42 Union Street.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know the prisoner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He was a boarder in my house.\"\r\n\r\n\"For how long?\"\r\n\r\n\"From December first. He and his wife came at that time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was his wife the actress, Jennie Brice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were they living together at your house the night of March fourth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what part of the house?\"\r\n\r\n\"They rented the double parlors down-stairs, but on account of the\r\nflood I moved them up-stairs to the second floor front.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was on Sunday? You moved them on Sunday?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"At what time did you retire that night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. The water was very high. I lay down, dressed, at one\r\no'clock, and dropped into a doze.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long did you sleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"An hour or so. Mr. Reynolds, a boarder, roused me to say he had heard\r\nsome one rowing a boat in the lower hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you keep a boat around during flood times?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do when Mr. Reynolds roused you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I went to the top of the stairs. My boat was gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was the boat secured?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Anyhow, there was no current in the hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I waited a time and went back to my room.\"\r\n\r\n\"What examination of the house did you make--if any?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Reynolds looked around.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he find?\"\r\n\r\n\"He found Peter, the Ladleys' dog, shut in a room on the third floor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was there anything unusual about that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had never known it to happen before.\"\r\n\r\n\"State what happened later.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not go to sleep again. At a quarter after four, I heard the\r\nboat come back. I took a candle and went to the stairs. It was Mr.\r\nLadley. He said he had been out getting medicine for his wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see him tie up the boat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you observe any stains on the rope?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not notice any.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was the prisoner's manner at that time?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought he was surly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mrs. Pitman, tell us about the following morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw Mr. Ladley at a quarter before seven. He said to bring\r\nbreakfast for one. His wife had gone away. I asked if she was not ill,\r\nand he said no; that she had gone away early; that he had rowed her to\r\nFederal Street, and that she would be back Saturday. It was shortly\r\nafter that that the dog Peter brought in one of Mrs. Ladley's\r\nslippers, water-soaked.\"\r\n\r\n\"You recognized the slipper?\"\r\n\r\n\"Positively. I had seen it often.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I took it to Mr. Ladley.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he say?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said at first that it was not hers. Then he said if it was, she\r\nwould never wear it again--and then added--because it was ruined.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he offer any statement as to where his wife was?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. Not at that time. Before, he had said she had gone away for\r\na few days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell the jury about the broken knife.\"\r\n\r\n\"The dog found it floating in the parlor, with the blade broken.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had not left it down-stairs?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. I had used it up-stairs, the night before, and left it on a\r\nmantel of the room I was using as a temporary kitchen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was the door of this room locked?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. It was standing open.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you not asleep in this room?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You heard no one come in?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one--until Mr. Reynolds roused me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did you find the blade?\"\r\n\r\n\"Behind the bed in Mr. Ladley's room.\"\r\n\r\n\"What else did you find in the room?\"\r\n\r\n\"A blood-stained towel behind the wash-stand. Also, my onyx clock was\r\nmissing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where was the clock when the Ladleys were moved up into this room?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the mantel. I wound it just before they came up-stairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you saw Mrs. Ladley on Sunday, did she say she was going away?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see any preparation for a journey?\"\r\n\r\n\"The black and white dress was laid out on the bed, and a small bag.\r\nShe said she was taking the dress to the theater to lend to Miss\r\nHope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all she said?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. She said she'd been wishing her husband would drown; that he was\r\na fiend.\"\r\n\r\nI could see that my testimony had made an impression.\r\n\nThe slipper, the rope, the towel, and the knife and blade were\r\nproduced in court, and I identified them all. They made a noticeable\r\nimpression on the jury. Then Mr. Llewellyn, the lawyer for the\r\ndefense, cross-examined me.\r\n\r\n\"Is it not true, Mrs. Pitman,\" he said, \"that many articles,\r\nparticularly shoes and slippers, are found floating around during a\r\nflood?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I admitted.\r\n\r\n\"Now, you say the dog found this slipper floating in the hall and\r\nbrought it to you. Are you sure this slipper belonged to Jennie\r\nBrice?\"\r\n\r\n\"She wore it. I presume it belonged to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ahem. Now, Mrs. Pitman, after the Ladleys had been moved to the\r\nupper floor, did you search their bedroom and the connecting room\r\ndown-stairs?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah. Then, how do you know that this slipper was not left on the floor\r\nor in a closet?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is possible, but not likely. Anyhow, it was not the slipper alone.\r\nIt was the other things _and_ the slipper. It was--\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. Now, Mrs. Pitman, this knife. Can you identify it\r\npositively?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"But isn't it true that this is a very common sort of knife? One that\r\nnearly every housewife has in her possession?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. But that knife handle has three notches in it. I put the\r\nnotches there myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before this presumed crime?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"For what purpose?\"\r\n\r\n\"My neighbors were constantly borrowing things. It was a means of\r\nidentification.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then this knife is yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell again where you left it the night before it was found floating\r\ndown-stairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"On a shelf over the stove.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could the dog have reached it there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not without standing on a hot stove.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it not possible that Mr. Ladley, unable to untie the boat,\r\nborrowed your knife to cut the boat's painter?\"\r\n\r\n\"No painter was cut that I heard about The paper-hanger--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no. The boat's painter--the rope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Well, he might have. He never said.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now then, this towel, Mrs. Pitman. Did not the prisoner, on the\r\nfollowing day, tell you that he had cut his wrist in freeing the boat,\r\nand ask you for some court-plaster?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did not,\" I said firmly.\r\n\r\n\"You have not seen a scar on his wrist?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\" I glanced at Mr. Ladley: he was smiling, as if amused. It made\r\nme angry. \"And what's more,\" I flashed, \"if he has a cut on his wrist,\r\nhe put it there himself, to account for the towel.\"\r\n\r\nI was sorry the next moment that I had said it, but it was too late.\r\nThe counsel for the defense moved to exclude the answer and I received\r\na caution that I deserved. Then:\r\n\r\n\"You saw Mr. Ladley when he brought your boat back?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What time was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"A quarter after four Monday morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he come in quietly, like a man trying to avoid attention?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not particularly. It would have been of no use. The dog was barking.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he say?\"\r\n\r\n\"That he had been out for medicine. That his wife was sick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know a pharmacist named Alexander--Jonathan Alexander?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is such a one, but I don't know him.\"\r\n\r\nI was excused, and Mr. Reynolds was called. He had heard no quarreling\r\nthat Sunday night; had even heard Mrs. Ladley laughing. This was\r\nabout nine o'clock. Yes, they had fought in the afternoon. He had not\r\noverheard any words, but their voices were quarrelsome, and once he\r\nheard a chair or some article of furniture overthrown. Was awakened\r\nabout two by footsteps on the stairs, followed by the sound of oars\r\nin the lower hall. He told his story plainly and simply. Under\r\ncross-examination admitted that he was fond of detective stories and\r\nhad tried to write one himself; that he had said at the store that\r\nhe would like to see that \"conceited ass\" swing, referring to the\r\nprisoner; that he had sent flowers to Jennie Brice at the theater, and\r\nhad made a few advances to her, without success.\r\n\r\nMy head was going round. I don't know yet how the police learned it\r\nall, but by the time poor Mr. Reynolds left the stand, half the people\r\nthere believed that he had been in love with Jennie Brice, that she\r\nhad spurned his advances, and that there was more to the story than\r\nany of them had suspected.\r\n\r\nMiss Hope's story held without any alteration under the\r\ncross-examination. She was perfectly at ease, looked handsome and well\r\ndressed, and could not be shaken. She told how Jennie Brice had been\r\nin fear of her life, and had asked her, only the week before she\r\ndisappeared, to allow her to go home with her--Miss Hope. She told\r\nof the attack of hysteria in her dressing-room, and that the missing\r\nwoman had said that her husband would kill her some day. There was\r\nmuch wrangling over her testimony, and I believe at least a part of it\r\nwas not allowed to go to the jury. But I am not a lawyer, and I repeat\r\nwhat I recall.\r\n\r\n\"Did she say that he had attacked her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, more than once. She was a large woman, fairly muscular, and had\r\nalways held her own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she say that these attacks came when he had been drinking?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe he was worse then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she give any reason for her husband's attitude to her?\"\r\n\r\n\"She said he wanted to marry another woman.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a small sensation at this. If proved, it established a\r\nmotive.\r\n\r\n\"Did she know who the other woman was?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe not. She was away most of the day, and he put in his time\r\nas he liked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did Miss Brice ever mention the nature of the threats he made against\r\nher?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I think not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you examined the body washed ashore at Sewickley?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--\" in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"Is it the body of Jennie Brice?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can not say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does the remaining hand look like the hand of Jennie Brice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very much. The nails are filed to points, as she wore hers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever know of Jennie Brice having a scar on her breast?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but that would be easily concealed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just what do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Many actresses conceal defects. She could have worn flesh-colored\r\nplaster and covered it with powder. Also, such a scar would not\r\nnecessarily be seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Explain that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most of Jennie Brice's d\u00e9collet\u00e9 gowns were cut to a point. This\r\nwould conceal such a scar.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Hope was excused, and Jennie Brice's sister from Olean was\r\ncalled. She was a smaller woman than Jennie Brice had been, very\r\nlady-like in her manner. She said she was married and living in Olean;\r\nshe had not seen her sister for several years, but had heard from her\r\noften. The witness had discouraged the marriage to the prisoner.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"She had had bad luck before.\"\r\n\r\n\"She had been married before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, to a man named John Bellows. They were in vaudeville together,\r\non the Keith Circuit. They were known as The Pair of Bellows.\"\r\n\r\nI sat up at this for John Bellows had boarded at my house.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bellows is dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not. She divorced him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you know of any scar on your sister's body?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never heard of one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen the body found at Sewickley?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes\"--faintly.\r\n\r\n\"Can you identify it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\nA flurry was caused during the afternoon by Timothy Senft. He\r\ntestified to what I already knew--that between three and four on\r\nMonday morning, during the height of the flood, he had seen from his\r\nshanty-boat a small skiff caught in the current near the Ninth Street\r\nbridge. He had shouted encouragingly to the man in the boat, running\r\nout a way on the ice to make him hear. He had told him to row with the\r\ncurrent, and to try to steer in toward shore. He had followed close to\r\nthe river bank in his own boat. Below Sixth Street the other boat was\r\nwithin rope-throwing distance. He had pulled it in, and had towed it\r\nwell back out of the current. The man in the boat was the prisoner.\r\nAsked if the prisoner gave any explanation--yes, he said he couldn't\r\nsleep, and had thought to tire himself rowing. Had been caught in the\r\ncurrent before he knew it. Saw nothing suspicious in or about the\r\nboat. As they passed the police patrol boat, prisoner had called to\r\nask if there was much distress, and expressed regret when told there\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nTim was excused. He had made a profound impression. I would not have\r\ngiven a dollar for Mr. Ladley's chance with the jury, at that time.\r\n\nThe prosecution produced many witnesses during the next two days:\r\nShanty-boat Tim's story withstood the most vigorous cross-examination.\r\nAfter him, Mr. Bronson from the theater corroborated Miss Hope's story\r\nof Jennie Brice's attack of hysteria in the dressing-room, and told of\r\ntaking her home that night.\r\n\r\nHe was a poor witness, nervous and halting. He weighed each word\r\nbefore he said it, and he made a general unfavorable impression. I\r\nthought he was holding something back. In view of what Mr. Pitman\r\nwould have called the denouement, his attitude is easily explained.\r\nBut I was puzzled then.\r\n\r\nSo far, the prosecution had touched but lightly on the possible motive\r\nfor a crime--the woman. But on the third day, to my surprise, a Mrs.\r\nAgnes Murray was called. It was the Mrs. Murray I had seen at the\r\nmorgue.\r\n\r\nI have lost the clipping of that day's trial, but I remember her\r\ntestimony perfectly.\r\n\r\nShe was a widow, living above a small millinery shop on Federal\r\nStreet, Allegheny. She had one daughter, Alice, who did stenography\r\nand typing as a means of livelihood. She had no office, and worked at\r\nhome. Many of the small stores in the neighborhood employed her to\r\nsend out their bills. There was a card at the street entrance beside\r\nthe shop, and now and then strangers brought her work.\r\n\r\nEarly in December the prisoner had brought her the manuscript of a\r\nplay to type, and from that time on he came frequently, sometimes\r\nevery day, bringing a few sheets of manuscript at a time. Sometimes he\r\ncame without any manuscript, and would sit and talk while he smoked a\r\ncigarette. They had thought him unmarried.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, February twenty-eighth, Alice Murray had disappeared.\r\nShe had taken some of her clothing--not all, and had left a note. The\r\nwitness read the note aloud in a trembling voice:\r\n\r\n    \"DEAR MOTHER: When you get this I shall be married to Mr. Ladley.\r\n    Don't worry. Will write again from N.Y. Lovingly,\r\n\r\n    \"ALICE.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that time until a week before, she had not heard from her\r\ndaughter. Then she had a card, mailed from Madison Square Station, New\r\nYork City. The card merely said:\r\n\r\n    \"Am well and working. ALICE.\"\r\n\r\nThe defense was visibly shaken. They had not expected this, and I\r\nthought even Mr. Ladley, whose calm had continued unbroken, paled.\r\n\r\nSo far, all had gone well for the prosecution. They had proved a\r\ncrime, as nearly as circumstantial evidence could prove a crime, and\r\nthey had established a motive. But in the identification of the\r\nbody, so far they had failed. The prosecution \"rested,\" as they say,\r\nalthough they didn't rest much, on the afternoon of the third day.\r\n\r\nThe defense called, first of all, Eliza Shaeffer. She told of a woman\r\nanswering the general description of Jennie Brice having spent two\r\ndays at the Shaeffer farm at Horner. Being shown photographs of\r\nJennie Brice, she said she thought it was the same woman, but was\r\nnot certain. She told further of the woman leaving unexpectedly on\r\nWednesday of that week from Thornville. On cross-examination, being\r\nshown the small photograph which Mr. Graves had shown me, she\r\nidentified the woman in the group as being the woman in question.\r\nAs the face was in shadow, knew it more by the dress and hat: she\r\ndescribed the black and white dress and the hat with red trimming.\r\n\r\nThe defense then called me. I had to admit that the dress and hat as\r\ndescribed were almost certainly the ones I had seen on the bed in\r\nJennie Brice's room the day before she disappeared. I could not say\r\ndefinitely whether the woman in the photograph was Jennie Brice or\r\nnot; under a magnifying-glass thought it might be.\r\n\r\nDefense called Jonathan Alexander, a druggist who testified that on\r\nthe night in question he had been roused at half past three by the\r\nprisoner, who had said his wife was ill, and had purchased a bottle of\r\na proprietary remedy from him. His identification was absolute.\r\n\r\nThe defense called Jennie Brice's sister, and endeavored to prove\r\nthat Jennie Brice had had no such scar. It was shown that she was on\r\nintimate terms with her family and would hardly have concealed an\r\noperation of any gravity from them.\r\n\r\nThe defense scored that day. They had shown that the prisoner had told\r\nthe truth when he said he had gone to a pharmacy for medicine that\r\nnight for his wife; and they had shown that a woman, answering the\r\ndescription of Jennie Brice, spent two days in a town called Horner,\r\nand had gone from there on Wednesday after the crime. And they had\r\nshown that this woman was attired as Jennie Brice had been.\r\n\r\nThat was the way things stood on the afternoon of the fourth day, when\r\ncourt adjourned.\r\n\r\nMr. Reynolds was at home when I got there. He had been very much\r\nsubdued since the developments of that first day of the trial, sat\r\nmostly in his own room, and had twice brought me a bunch of jonquils\r\nas a peace-offering. He had the kettle boiling when I got home.\r\n\r\n\"You have had a number of visitors,\" he said. \"Our young friend Howell\r\nhas been here, and Mr. Holcombe has arrived and has a man in his\r\nroom.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Holcombe came down a moment after, with his face beaming.\r\n\r\n\"I think we've got him, Mrs. Pitman,\" he said. \"The jury won't even go\r\nout of the box.\"\r\n\r\nBut further than that he would not explain. He said he had a witness\r\nlocked in his room, and he'd be glad of supper for him, as they'd both\r\ncome a long ways. And he went out and bought some oysters and a bottle\r\nor two of beer. But as far as I know, he kept him locked up all that\r\nnight in the second-story front room. I don't think the man knew he\r\nwas a prisoner. I went in to turn down the bed, and he was sitting\r\nby the window, reading the evening paper's account of the trial--an\r\nelderly gentleman, rather professional-looking.\r\n\r\nMr. Holcombe slept on the upper landing of the hall that night, rolled\r\nin a blanket--not that I think his witness even thought of escaping,\r\nbut the little man was taking no chances.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock that night the bell rang. It was Mr. Howell. I\r\nadmitted him myself, and he followed me back to the dining-room. I had\r\nnot seen him for several weeks, and the change in him startled me. He\r\nwas dressed carefully, but his eyes were sunken in his head, and he\r\nlooked as if he had not slept for days.\r\n\r\nMr. Reynolds had gone up-stairs, not finding me socially inclined.\r\n\r\n\"You haven't been sick, Mr. Howell, have you?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, I'm well enough, I've been traveling about. Those infernal\r\nsleeping-cars--\"\r\n\r\nHis voice trailed off, and I saw him looking at my mother's picture,\r\nwith the jonquils beneath.\r\n\r\n\"That's curious!\" he said, going closer. \"It--it looks almost like\r\nLida Harvey.\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother,\" I said simply.\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen her lately?\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother?\" I asked, startled.\r\n\r\n\"No, Lida.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw her a few days ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. She came here, Mr. Howell, two weeks ago. She looks badly--as if\r\nshe is worrying.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not--about me?\" he asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, about you. What possessed you to go away as you did? When\r\nmy--bro--when her uncle accused you of something, you ran away,\r\ninstead of facing things like a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was trying to find the one person who could clear me, Mrs. Pitman.\"\r\nHe sat back, with his eyes closed; he looked ill enough to be in bed.\r\n\r\n\"And you succeeded?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nI thought perhaps he had not been eating and I offered him food, as\r\nI had once before. But he refused it, with the ghost of his boyish\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"I'm hungry, but it's not food I want. I want to see _her_,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI sat down across from him and tried to mend a table-cloth, but I\r\ncould not sew. I kept seeing those two young things, each sick for\r\na sight of the other, and, from wishing they could have a minute\r\ntogether, I got to planning it for them.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" I said finally, \"if you want it very much--\"\r\n\r\n\"Very much!\"\r\n\r\n\"And if you will sit quiet, and stop tapping your fingers together\r\nuntil you drive me crazy, I might contrive it for you. For five\r\nminutes,\" I said. \"Not a second longer.\"\r\n\r\nHe came right over and put his arms around me.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you, anyhow?\" he said. \"You who turn to the world the frozen\r\nmask of a Union Street boarding-house landlady, who are a gentlewoman\r\nby every instinct and training, and a girl at heart? Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what I am,\" I said. \"I'm a romantic old fool, and you'd\r\nbetter let me do this quickly, before I change my mind.\"\r\n\r\nHe freed me at that, but he followed to the telephone, and stood by\r\nwhile I got Lida. He was in a perfect frenzy of anxiety, turning red\r\nand white by turns, and in the middle of the conversation taking the\r\nreceiver bodily from me and holding it to his own ear.\r\n\r\nShe said she thought she could get away; she spoke guardedly, as if\r\nAlma were near, but I gathered that she would come as soon as she\r\ncould, and, from the way her voice broke, I knew she was as excited as\r\nthe boy beside me.\r\n\r\nShe came, heavily coated and veiled, at a quarter after ten that\r\nnight, and I took her back to the dining-room, where he was waiting.\r\nHe did not make a move toward her, but stood there with his very lips\r\nwhite, looking at her. And, at first, she did not make a move either,\r\nbut stood and gazed at him, thin and white, a wreck of himself. Then:\r\n\r\n\"Ell!\" she cried, and ran around the table to him, as he held out his\r\narms.\r\n\r\nThe school-teacher was out. I went into the parlor bedroom and sat in\r\nthe cozy corner in the dark. I had done a wrong thing, and I was glad\r\nof it. And sitting there in the darkness, I went over my own life\r\nagain. After all, it had been my own life; I had lived it; no one else\r\nhad shaped it for me. And if it was cheerless and colorless now, it\r\nhad had its big moments. Life is measured by big moments.\r\n\r\nIf I let the two children in the dining-room have fifteen big moments,\r\ninstead of five, who can blame me?\r\n\nThe next day was the sensational one of the trial. We went through\r\nevery phase of conviction: Jennie Brice was living. Jennie Brice was\r\ndead. The body found at Sewickley could not be Jennie Brice's. The\r\nbody found at Sewickley _was_ Jennie Brice's. And so it went on.\r\n\r\nThe defense did an unexpected thing in putting Mr. Ladley on the\r\nstand. That day, for the first time, he showed the wear and tear of\r\nthe ordeal. He had no flower in his button-hole, and the rims of his\r\neyes were red. But he was quite cool. His stage training had taught\r\nhim not only to endure the eyes of the crowd, but to find in its gaze\r\na sort of stimulant. He made a good witness, I must admit.\r\n\r\nHe replied to the usual questions easily. After five minutes or so Mr.\r\nLlewellyn got down to work.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Ladley, you have said that your wife was ill the night of March\r\nfourth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was the nature of her illness?\"\r\n\r\n\"She had a functional heart trouble, not serious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you tell us fully the events of that night?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had been asleep when my wife wakened me. She asked for a medicine\r\nshe used in these attacks. I got up and found the bottle, but it was\r\nempty. As she was nervous and frightened, I agreed to try to get some\r\nat a drug store. I went down-stairs, took Mrs. Pitman's boat, and went\r\nto several stores before I could awaken a pharmacist.\"\r\n\r\n\"You cut the boat loose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. It was tied in a woman's knot, or series of knots. I could not\r\nuntie it, and I was in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you cut it?\"\r\n\r\n\"With my pocket-knife.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did not use Mrs. Pitman's bread-knife?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not.\"\r\n\r\n\"And in cutting it, you cut your wrist, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. The knife slipped. I have the scar still.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I went back to the room, and stanched the blood with a towel.\"\r\n\r\n\"From whom did you get the medicine?\"\r\n\r\n\"From Alexander's Pharmacy.\"\r\n\r\n\"At what time?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not certain. About three o'clock, probably.\"\r\n\r\n\"You went directly back home?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ladley hesitated. \"No,\" he said finally. \"My wife had had these\r\nattacks, but they were not serious. I was curious to see how the\r\nriver-front looked and rowed out too far. I was caught in the current\r\nand nearly carried away.\"\r\n\r\n\"You came home after that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, at once. Mrs. Ladley was better and had dropped asleep. She\r\nwakened as I came in. She was disagreeable about the length of time I\r\nhad been gone, and would not let me explain. We--quarreled, and she\r\nsaid she was going to leave me. I said that as she had threatened this\r\nbefore and had never done it, I would see that she really started. At\r\ndaylight I rowed her to Federal Street.\"\r\n\r\n\"What had she with her?\"\r\n\r\n\"A small brown valise.\"\r\n\r\n\"How was she dressed?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a black and white dress and hat, with a long black coat.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was the last you saw of her?\"\r\n\r\n\"She was going across the Sixth Street bridge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. She went with a young man we knew.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a stir in the court room at this.\r\n\r\n\"Who was the young man?\"\r\n\r\n\"A Mr. Howell, a reporter on a newspaper here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen Mr. Howell since your arrest?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. He has been out of the city.\"\r\n\r\nI was so excited by this time that I could hardly hear. I missed some\r\nof the cross-examination. The district attorney pulled Mr. Ladley's\r\ntestimony to pieces.\r\n\r\n\"You cut the boat's painter with your pocket-knife?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how do you account for Mrs. Pitman's broken knife, with the\r\nblade in your room?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no theory about it. She may have broken it herself. She had\r\nused it the day before to lift tacks out of a carpet.\"\r\n\r\nThat was true; I had.\r\n\r\n\"That early Monday morning was cold, was it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Very.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did your wife leave without her fur coat?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not know she had until we had left the house. Then I did not\r\nask her. She would not speak to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see. But is it not true that, upon a wet fur coat being shown you\r\nas your wife's, you said it could not be hers, as she had taken hers\r\nwith her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not recall such a statement.\"\r\n\r\n\"You recall a coat being shown you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Mrs. Pitman brought a coat to my door, but I was working on a\r\nplay I am writing, and I do not remember what I said. The coat was\r\nruined. I did not want it. I probably said the first thing I thought\r\nof to get rid of the woman.\"\r\n\r\nI got up at that. I'd held my peace about the bread-knife, but this\r\nwas too much. However, the moment I started to speak, somebody pushed\r\nme back into my chair and told me to be quiet.\r\n\r\n\"Now, you say you were in such a hurry to get this medicine for your\r\nwife that you cut the rope, thus cutting your wrist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I have the scar still.\"\r\n\r\n\"You could not wait to untie the boat, and yet you went along the\r\nriver-front to see how high the water was?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her alarm had excited me. But when I got out, and remembered that\r\nthe doctors had told us she would never die in an attack, I grew more\r\ncomposed.\"\r\n\r\n\"You got the medicine first, you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Alexander has testified that you got the medicine at\r\nthree-thirty. It has been shown that you left the house at two, and\r\ngot back about four. Does not this show that with all your alarm you\r\nwent to the river-front first?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was gone from two to four,\" he replied calmly. \"Mr. Alexander must\r\nbe wrong about the time I wakened him. I got the medicine first.\"\r\n\r\n\"When your wife left you at the bridge, did she say where she was\r\ngoing?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"You claim that this woman at Horner was your wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it likely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was there an onyx clock in the second-story room when you moved into\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not recall the clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your wife did not take an onyx clock away with her?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ladley smiled. \"No.\"\r\n\r\nThe defense called Mr. Howell next. He looked rested, and the happier\r\nfor having seen Lida, but he was still pale and showed the strain of\r\nsome hidden anxiety. What that anxiety was, the next two days were to\r\ntell us all.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Howell,\" Mr. Llewellyn asked, \"you know the prisoner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Slightly.\"\r\n\r\n\"State when you met him.\"\r\n\r\n\"On Sunday morning, March the fourth. I went to see him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you tell us the nature of that visit?\"\r\n\r\n\"My paper had heard he was writing a play for himself. I was to get an\r\ninterview, with photographs, if possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"You saw his wife at that time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did you see her again?\"\r\n\r\n\"The following morning, at six o'clock, or a little later. I walked\r\nacross the Sixth Street bridge with her, and put her on a train for\r\nHorner, Pennsylvania.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are positive it was Jennie Brice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I watched her get out of the boat, while her husband steadied\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you knew this, why did you not come forward sooner?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been out of the city.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you knew the prisoner had been arrested, and that this testimony\r\nof yours would be invaluable to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. But I thought it necessary to produce Jennie Brice herself. My\r\nunsupported word--\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been searching for Jennie Brice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Since March the eighth.\"\r\n\r\n\"How was she dressed when you saw her last?\"\r\n\r\n\"She wore a red and black hat and a black coat. She carried a small\r\nbrown valise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you.\"\r\n\r\nThe cross-examination did not shake his testimony. But it brought out\r\nsome curious things. Mr. Howell refused to say how he happened to be\r\nat the end of the Sixth Street bridge at that hour, or why he had\r\nthought it necessary, on meeting a woman he claimed to have known only\r\ntwenty-four hours, to go with her to the railway station and put her\r\non a train.\r\n\r\nThe jury was visibly impressed and much shaken. For Mr. Howell carried\r\nconviction in every word he said; he looked the district attorney\r\nin the eye, and once when our glances crossed he even smiled at me\r\nfaintly. But I saw why he had tried to find Jennie Brice, and had\r\ndreaded testifying. Not a woman in that court room, and hardly a man,\r\nbut believed when he left the stand, that he was, or had been, Jennie\r\nBrice's lover, and as such was assisting her to leave her husband.\r\n\r\n\"Then you believe,\" the district attorney said at the end,--\"you\r\nbelieve, Mr. Howell, that Jennie Brice is living?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jennie Brice was living on Monday morning, March the fifth,\" he said\r\nfirmly.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Shaeffer has testified that on Wednesday this woman, who you\r\nclaim was Jennie Brice, sent a letter to you from Horner. Is that the\r\ncase?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The letter was signed 'Jennie Brice'?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was signed 'J.B.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you show the court that letter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I destroyed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a personal letter?\"\r\n\r\n\"It merely said she had arrived safely, and not to let any one know\r\nwhere she was.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet you destroyed it?\"\r\n\r\n\"A postscript said to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know. An extra precaution probably.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were under the impression that she was going to stay there?\"\r\n\r\n\"She was to have remained for a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you have been searching for this woman for two months?\"\r\n\r\nHe quailed, but his voice was steady. \"Yes,\" he admitted.\r\n\r\nHe was telling the truth, even if it was not all the truth. I believe,\r\nhad it gone to the jury then, Mr. Ladley would have been acquitted.\r\nBut, late that afternoon, things took a new turn. Counsel for the\r\nprosecution stated to the court that he had a new and important\r\nwitness, and got permission to introduce this further evidence. The\r\nwitness was a Doctor Littlefield, and proved to be my one-night tenant\r\nof the second-story front. Holcombe's prisoner of the night before\r\ntook the stand. The doctor was less impressive in full daylight; he\r\nwas a trifle shiny, a bit bulbous as to nose and indifferent as to\r\nfinger-nails. But his testimony was given with due professional\r\nweight.\r\n\r\n\"You are a doctor of medicine, Doctor Littlefield?\" asked the district\r\nattorney.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"In active practise?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a Cure for Inebriates in Des Moines, Iowa. I was formerly in\r\ngeneral practise in New York City.\"\r\n\r\n\"You knew Jennie Ladley?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had seen her at different theaters. And she consulted me\r\nprofessionally at one time in New York.\"\r\n\r\n\"You operated on her, I believe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. She came to me to have a name removed. It had been tattooed over\r\nher heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"You removed it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at once. I tried fading the marks with goat's milk, but she was\r\nimpatient. On the third visit to my office she demanded that the name\r\nbe cut out.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. She refused a general anesthetic and I used cocaine. The name\r\nwas John--I believe a former husband. She intended to marry again.\"\r\n\r\nA titter ran over the court room. People strained to the utmost are\r\nalways glad of an excuse to smile. The laughter of a wrought-up crowd\r\nalways seems to me half hysterical.\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen photographs of the scar on the body found at Sewickley?\r\nOr the body itself?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I have not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you describe the operation?\"\r\n\r\n\"I made a transverse incision for the body of the name, and two\r\nvertical ones--one longer for the _J_, the other shorter, for the\r\nstem of the _h_. There was a dot after the name. I made a half-inch\r\nincision for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you sketch the cicatrix as you recall it?\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor made a careful drawing on a pad that was passed to him. The\r\ndrawing was much like this.\r\n\r\nLine for line, dot for dot, it was the scar on the body found at\r\nSewickley.\r\n\r\n\"You are sure the woman was Jennie Brice?\"\r\n\r\n\"She sent me tickets for the theater shortly after. And I had an\r\nannouncement of her marriage to the prisoner, some weeks later.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were there any witnesses to the operation?\"\r\n\r\n\"My assistant; I can produce him at any time.\"\r\n\r\nThat was not all of the trial, but it was the decisive moment. Shortly\r\nafter, the jury withdrew, and for twenty-four hours not a word was\r\nheard from them.\r\n\nAfter twenty-four hours' deliberation, the jury brought in a verdict\r\nof guilty. It was a first-degree verdict. Mr. Howell's unsupported\r\nword had lost out against a scar.\r\n\r\nContrary to my expectation, Mr. Holcombe was not jubilant over the\r\nverdict. He came into the dining-room that night and stood by the\r\nwindow, looking out into the yard.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't logical,\" he said. \"In view of Howell's testimony, it's\r\nridiculous! Heaven help us under this jury system, anyhow! Look at the\r\nfacts! Howell knows the woman: he sees her on Monday morning, and\r\nputs her on a train out of town. The boy is telling the truth. He has\r\nnothing to gain by coming forward, and everything to lose. Very\r\nwell: she was alive on Monday. We know where she was on Tuesday and\r\nWednesday. Anyhow, during those days her gem of a husband was in jail.\r\nHe was freed Thursday night, and from that time until his rearrest on\r\nthe following Tuesday, I had him under observation every moment. He\r\nleft the jail Thursday night, and on Saturday the body floated in at\r\nSewickley. If it was done by Ladley, it must have been done on Friday,\r\nand on Friday he was in view through the periscope all day!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Reynolds came in and joined us. \"There's only one way out that I\r\nsee,\" he said mildly. \"Two women have been fool enough to have a name\r\ntattooed over their hearts. No woman ever thought enough of me to have\r\n_my_ name put on her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope not,\" I retorted. Mr. Reynold's first name is Zachariah.\r\n\r\nBut, as Mr. Holcombe said, all that had been proved was that Jennie\r\nBrice was dead, probably murdered. He could not understand the defense\r\nletting the case go to the jury without their putting more stress on\r\nMr. Howell's story. But we were to understand that soon, and many\r\nother things. Mr. Holcombe told me that evening of learning from John\r\nBellows of the tattooed name on Jennie Brice and of how, after an\r\nalmost endless search, he had found the man who had cut the name away.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock the door-bell rang. Mr. Reynolds had gone to lodge,\r\nhe being an Elk and several other things, and much given to regalia\r\nin boxes, and having his picture in the newspapers in different\r\noutlandish costumes. Mr. Pitman used to say that man, being denied his\r\nnatural love for barbaric adornment in his every-day clothing, took to\r\nthe different fraternities as an excuse for decking himself out. But\r\nthis has nothing to do with the door-bell.\r\n\r\nIt was old Isaac. He had a basket in his hand, and he stepped into the\r\nhall and placed it on the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Evening, Miss Bess,\" he said. \"Can you see a bit of company\r\nto-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can always see you,\" I replied. But he had not meant himself. He\r\nstepped to the door, and opening it, beckoned to some one across the\r\nstreet. It was Lida!\r\n\r\nShe came in, her color a little heightened, and old Isaac stood back,\r\nbeaming at us both; I believe it was one of the crowning moments\r\nof the old man's life--thus to see his Miss Bess and Alma's child\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\"Is--is he here yet?\" she asked me nervously.\r\n\r\n\"I did not know he was coming.\" There was no need to ask which \"he.\"\r\nThere was only one for Lida.\r\n\r\n\"He telephoned me, and asked me to come here. Oh, Mrs. Pitman, I'm\r\nso afraid for him!\" She had quite forgotten Isaac. I turned to the\r\nschool-teacher's room and opened the door. \"The woman who belongs here\r\nis out at a lecture,\" I said. \"Come in here, Ikkie, and I'll find the\r\nevening paper for you.\r\n\r\n\"'Ikkie'!\" said Lida, and stood staring at me. I think I went white.\r\n\r\n\"The lady heah and I is old friends,\" Isaac said, with his splendid\r\nmanner. \"Her mothah, Miss Lida, her mothah--\"\r\n\r\nBut even old Isaac choked up at that, and I closed the door on him.\r\n\r\n\"How queer!\" Lida said, looking at me. \"So Isaac knew your mother?\r\nHave you lived always in Allegheny, Mrs. Pitman?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was born in Pittsburgh,\" I evaded. \"I went away for a long time,\r\nbut I always longed for the hurry and activity of the old home town.\r\nSo here I am again.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately, like all the young, her own affairs engrossed her. She\r\nwas flushed with the prospect of meeting her lover, tremulous over\r\nwhat the evening might bring. The middle-aged woman who had come back\r\nto the hurry of the old town, and who, pushed back into an eddy of the\r\nflood district, could only watch the activity and the life from behind\r\na \"Rooms to Let\" sign, did not concern her much. Nor should she have.\r\n\r\nMr. Howell came soon after. He asked for her, and going back to the\r\ndining-room, kissed her quietly. He had an air of resolve, a sort of\r\ngrim determination, that was a relief from the half-frantic look he\r\nhad worn before. He asked to have Mr. Holcombe brought down, and so\r\nbehold us all, four of us, sitting around the table--Mr. Holcombe with\r\nhis note-book, I with my mending, and the boy with one of Lida's hands\r\nfrankly under his on the red table-cloth.\r\n\r\n\"I want to tell all of you the whole story,\" he began. \"To-morrow I\r\nshall go to the district attorney and confess, but--I want you all to\r\nhave it first. I can't sleep again until I get it off my chest. Mrs.\r\nPitman has suffered through me, and Mr. Holcombe here has spent money\r\nand time--\"\r\n\r\nLida did not speak, but she drew her chair closer, and put her other\r\nhand over his.\r\n\r\n\"I want to get it straight, if I can. Let me see. It was on Sunday,\r\nthe fourth, that the river came up, wasn't it? Yes. Well, on the\r\nThursday before that I met you, Mr. Holcombe, in a restaurant in\r\nPittsburgh. Do you remember?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Holcombe nodded.\r\n\r\n\"We were talking of crime, and I said no man should be hanged on\r\npurely circumstantial evidence. You affirmed that a well-linked chain\r\nof circumstantial evidence could properly hang a man. We had a long\r\nargument, in which I was worsted. There was a third man at the\r\ntable--Bronson, the business manager of the Liberty Theater.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who sided with you,\" put in Mr. Holcombe, \"and whose views I refused\r\nto entertain because, as publicity man for a theater, he dealt in\r\nfiction rather than in fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely. You may recall, Mr. Holcombe, that you offered to hang any\r\nman we would name, given a proper chain of circumstantial evidence\r\nagainst him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"After you left, Bronson spoke to me. He said business at the theater\r\nwas bad, and complained of the way the papers used, or would not use,\r\nhis stuff. He said the Liberty Theater had not had a proper deal, and\r\nthat he was tempted to go over and bang one of the company on the\r\nhead, and so get a little free advertising.\r\n\r\n\"I said he ought to be able to fake a good story; but he maintained\r\nthat a newspaper could smell a faked story a mile away, and that,\r\nanyhow, all the good stunts had been pulled off. I agreed with him. I\r\nremember saying that nothing but a railroad wreck or a murder hit the\r\npublic very hard these days, and that I didn't feel like wrecking the\r\nPennsylvania Limited.\r\n\r\n\"He leaned over the table and looked at me. 'Well, how about a murder,\r\nthen?' he said. 'You get the story for your paper, and I get some\r\nadvertising for the theater. We need it, that's sure.'\r\n\r\n\"I laughed it off, and we separated. But at two o'clock Bronson called\r\nme up again. I met him in his office at the theater, and he told me\r\nthat Jennie Brice, who was out of the cast that week, had asked for a\r\nweek's vacation. She had heard of a farm at a town called Horner, and\r\nshe wanted to go there to rest.\r\n\r\n\"'Now the idea is this,' he said. 'She's living with her husband, and\r\nhe has threatened her life more than once. It would be easy enough to\r\nframe up something to look as if he'd made away with her. We'd get a\r\nweek of excitement, more advertising than we'd ordinarily get in a\r\nyear; you get a corking news story, and find Jennie Brice at the end,\r\ngetting the credit for that. Jennie gets a hundred dollars and a rest,\r\nand Ladley, her husband, gets, say, two hundred.'\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bronson offered to put up the money, and I agreed. The flood came\r\njust then, and was considerable help. It made a good setting. I went\r\nto my city editor, and got an assignment to interview Ladley about\r\nthis play of his. Then Bronson and I went together to see the Ladleys\r\non Sunday morning, and as they needed money, they agreed. But Ladley\r\ninsisted on fifty dollars a week extra if he had to go to jail. We\r\npromised it, but we did not intend to let things go so far as that.\r\n\r\n\"In the Ladleys' room that Sunday morning, we worked it all out. The\r\nhardest thing was to get Jennie Brice's consent; but she agreed,\r\nfinally. We arranged a list of clues, to be left around, and Ladley\r\nwas to go out in the night and to be heard coming back. I told him to\r\nquarrel with his wife that afternoon,--although I don't believe\r\nthey needed to be asked to do it,--and I suggested also the shoe or\r\nslipper, to be found floating around.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a moment,\" said Mr. Holcombe, busy with his note-book. \"Did you\r\nsuggest the onyx clock?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. No clock was mentioned. The--the clock has puzzled me.\"\r\n\r\n\"The towel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I said no murder was complete without blood, but he kicked on\r\nthat--said he didn't mind the rest, but he'd be hanged if he was going\r\nto slash himself. But, as it happened, he cut his wrist while cutting\r\nthe boat loose, and so we had the towel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pillow-slip?\" asked Mr. Holcombe.\r\n\r\n\"Well, no. There was nothing said about a pillow-slip. Didn't he say\r\nhe burned it accidentally?\"\r\n\r\n\"So he claimed.\" Mr. Holcombe made another entry in his book.\r\n\r\n\"Then I said every murder had a weapon. He was to have a pistol at\r\nfirst, but none of us owned one. Mrs. Ladley undertook to get a knife\r\nfrom Mrs. Pitman's kitchen, and to leave it around, not in full view,\r\nbut where it could be found.\"\r\n\r\n\"A broken knife?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Just a knife.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was to throw the knife into the water?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was not arranged. I only gave him a general outline. He was to\r\nadd any interesting details that might occur to him. The idea, of\r\ncourse, was to give the police plenty to work on, and just when\r\nthey thought they had it all, and when the theater had had a lot of\r\nbooming, and I had got a good story, to produce Jennie Brice, safe\r\nand well. We were not to appear in it at all. It would have worked\r\nperfectly, but we forgot to count on one thing--Jennie Brice hated her\r\nhusband.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not really hated him!\" cried Lida.\r\n\r\n\"_Hated_ him. She is letting him hang. She could save him by coming\r\nforward now, and she won't do it. She is hiding so he will go to the\r\ngallows.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause at that. It seemed too incredible, too inhuman.\r\n\r\n\"Then, early that Monday morning, you smuggled Jennie Brice out of the\r\ncity?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. That was the only thing we bungled. We fixed the hour a little\r\ntoo late, and I was seen by Miss Harvey's uncle, walking across the\r\nbridge with a woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you meet her openly, and take her to the train?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Howell bent forward and smiled across at the little man. \"One\r\nof your own axioms, sir,\" he said. \"Do the natural thing; upset the\r\ncustomary order of events as little as possible. Jennie Brice went to\r\nthe train, because that was where she wanted to go. But as Ladley was\r\nto protest that his wife had left town, and as the police would\r\nbe searching for a solitary woman, I went with her. We went in a\r\nleisurely manner. I bought her a magazine and a morning paper, asked\r\nthe conductor to fix her window, and, in general, acted the devoted\r\nhusband seeing his wife off on a trip. I even\"--he smiled--\"I even\r\npromised to feed the canary.\"\r\n\r\nLida took her hands away. \"Did you kiss her good-by?\" she demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Not even a chaste salute,\" he said. His spirits were rising. It was,\r\nas often happens, as if the mere confession removed the guilt. I have\r\nseen little boys who have broken a window show the same relief after\r\ntelling about it.\r\n\r\n\"For a day or two Bronson and I sat back, enjoying the stir-up. Things\r\nturned out as we had expected. Business boomed at the theater. I got\r\na good story, and some few kind words from my city editor. Then--the\r\nexplosion came. I got a letter from Jennie Brice saying she was going\r\naway, and that we need not try to find her. I went to Horner, but I\r\nhad lost track of her completely. Even then, we did not believe things\r\nso bad as they turned out to be. We thought she was giving us a bad\r\ntime, but that she would show up.\r\n\r\n\"Ladley was in a blue funk for a time. Bronson and I went to him. We\r\ntold him how the thing had slipped up. We didn't want to go to the\r\npolice and confess if we could help it. Finally, he agreed to stick it\r\nout until she was found, at a hundred dollars a week. It took all we\r\ncould beg, borrow and steal. But now--we have to come out with the\r\nstory anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Holcombe sat up and closed his note-book with a snap. \"I'm not so\r\nsure of that,\" he said impressively. \"I wonder if you realize, young\r\nman, that, having provided a perfect defense for this man Ladley, you\r\nprovided him with every possible inducement to make away with his\r\nwife? Secure in your coming forward at the last minute and confessing\r\nthe hoax to save him, was there anything he might not have dared with\r\nimpunity?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I tell you I took Jennie Brice out of town on Monday morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Did you_?\" asked Mr. Holcombe sternly.\r\n\r\nBut at that, the school-teacher, having come home and found old Isaac\r\nsound asleep in her cozy corner, set up such a screaming for the\r\npolice that our meeting broke up. Nor would Mr. Holcombe explain any\r\nfurther.\r\n\nMr. Holcombe was up very early the next morning. I heard him moving\r\naround at five o'clock, and at six he banged at my door and demanded\r\nto know at what time the neighborhood rose: he had been up for an hour\r\nand there were no signs of life. He was more cheerful after he had had\r\na cup of coffee, commented on Lida's beauty, and said that Howell was\r\na lucky chap.\r\n\r\n\"That is what worries me, Mr. Holcombe,\" I said. \"I am helping the\r\naffair along and--what if it turns out badly?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me over his glasses. \"It isn't likely to turn out badly,\"\r\nhe said. \"I have never married, Mrs. Pitman, and I have missed a great\r\ndeal out of life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you're better off: if you had married and lost your wife--\" I\r\nwas thinking of Mr. Pitman.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" he said with emphasis. \"It's better to have married and\r\nlost than never to have married at all. Every man needs a good woman,\r\nand it doesn't matter how old he is. The older he is, the more he\r\nneeds her. I am nearly sixty.\"\r\n\r\nI was rather startled, and I almost dropped the fried potatoes. But\r\nthe next moment he had got out his note-book and was going over\r\nthe items again. \"Pillow-slip,\" he said, \"knife _broken_, onyx\r\nclock--wouldn't think so much of the clock if he hadn't been so\r\ndamnably anxious to hide the key, the discrepancy in time as revealed\r\nby the trial--yes, it is as clear as a bell. Mrs. Pitman, does that\r\nMaguire woman next door sleep all day?\"\r\n\r\n\"She's up now,\" I said, looking out the window.\r\n\r\nHe was in the hall in a moment, only to come to the door later, hat in\r\nhand. \"Is she the only other woman on the street who keeps boarders?\"\r\n\r\n\"She's the only woman who doesn't,\" I snapped. \"She'll keep anything\r\nthat doesn't belong to her--except boarders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\"\r\n\r\nHe lighted his corn-cob pipe and stood puffing at it and watching me.\r\nHe made me uneasy: I thought he was going to continue the subject of\r\nevery man needing a wife, and I'm afraid I had already decided to take\r\nhim if he offered, and to put the school-teacher out and have a real\r\nparlor again, but to keep Mr. Reynolds, he being tidy and no bother.\r\n\r\nBut when he spoke, he was back to the crime again: \"Did you ever work\r\na typewriter?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nWhat with the surprise, I was a little sharp. \"I don't play any\r\ninstrument except an egg-beater,\" I replied shortly, and went on\r\nclearing the table.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder--do you remember about the village idiot and the horse? But\r\nof course you do, Mrs. Pitman; you are a woman of imagination. Don't\r\nyou think you could be Alice Murray for a few moments? Now think--you\r\nare a stenographer with theatrical ambitions: you meet an actor and\r\nyou fall in love with him, and he with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's hard to imagine, that last.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so hard,\" he said gently. \"Now the actor is going to put you on\r\nthe stage, perhaps in this new play, and some day he is going to marry\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that what he promised the girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"According to some letters her mother found, yes. The actor is\r\nmarried, but he tells you he will divorce the wife; you are to wait\r\nfor him, and in the meantime he wants you near him; away from the\r\noffice, where other men are apt to come in with letters to be typed,\r\nand to chaff you. You are a pretty girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't necessary to overwork my imagination,\" I said, with a little\r\nbitterness. I had been a pretty girl, but work and worry--\r\n\r\n\"Now you are going to New York very soon, and in the meantime you have\r\ncut yourself off from all your people. You have no one but this man.\r\nWhat would you do? Where would you go?\"\r\n\r\n\"How old was the girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nineteen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" I said slowly, \"that if I were nineteen, and in love with a\r\nman, and hiding, I would hide as near him as possible. I'd be likely\r\nto get a window that could see his going out and coming in, a place so\r\nnear that he could come often to see me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo!\" he exclaimed. \"Of course, with your present wisdom and\r\nexperience, you would do nothing so foolish. But this girl was in her\r\nteens; she was not very far away, for he probably saw her that Sunday\r\nafternoon, when he was out for two hours. And as the going was slow\r\nthat day, and he had much to tell and explain, I figure she was not\r\nfar off. Probably in this very neighborhood.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of that morning I saw Mr. Holcombe, at intervals,\r\ngoing from house to house along Union Street, making short excursions\r\ninto side thoroughfares, coming back again and taking up his door-bell\r\nringing with unflagging energy. I watched him off and on for two\r\nhours. At the end of that time he came back flushed and excited.\r\n\r\n\"I found the house,\" he said, wiping his glasses. \"She was there, all\r\nright, not so close as we had thought, but as close as she could get.\"\r\n\r\n\"And can you trace her?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nHis face changed and saddened. \"Poor child!\" he said. \"She is dead,\r\nMrs. Pitman!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not she--at Sewickley!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said patiently. \"That was Jennie Brice.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--Mr. Howell--\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Howell is a young ass,\" he said with irritation. \"He did not take\r\nJennie Brice out of the city that morning. He took Alice Murray in\r\nJennie Brice's clothing, and veiled.\"\r\n\r\nWell, that is five years ago. Five times since then the Allegheny\r\nRiver, from being a mild and inoffensive stream, carrying a few boats\r\nand a great deal of sewage, has become, a raging destroyer, and has\r\nfilled our hearts with fear and our cellars with mud. Five times since\r\nthen Molly Maguire has appropriated all that the flood carried from my\r\npremises to hers, and five times have I lifted my carpets and moved\r\nMr. Holcombe, who occupies the parlor bedroom, to a second-floor room.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, as I said at the beginning, we found Peter's body\r\nfloating in the cellar, and as soon as the yard was dry, I buried him.\r\nHe had grown fat and lazy, but I shall miss him.\r\n\r\nYesterday a riverman fell off a barge along the water-front and was\r\ndrowned. They dragged the river for his body, but they did not find\r\nhim. But they found something--an onyx clock, with the tattered\r\nremnant of a muslin pillow-slip wrapped around it. It only bore out\r\nthe story, as we had known it for five years.\r\n\r\nThe Murray girl had lived long enough to make a statement to the\r\npolice, although Mr. Holcombe only learned this later. On the\r\nstatement being shown to Ladley in the jail, and his learning of the\r\ngirl's death, he collapsed. He confessed before he was hanged, and his\r\nconfession, briefly, was like this:\r\n\r\nHe had met the Murray girl in connection with the typing of his play,\r\nand had fallen in love with her. He had never cared for his wife, and\r\nwould have been glad to get rid of her in any way possible. He had not\r\nintended to kill her, however. He had planned to elope with the Murray\r\ngirl, and awaiting an opportunity, had persuaded her to leave home and\r\nto take a room near my house.\r\n\r\nHere he had visited her daily, while his wife was at the theater.\r\n\r\nThey had planned to go to New York together on Monday, March the\r\nfifth. On Sunday, the fourth, however, Mr. Bronson and Mr. Howell\r\nhad made their curious proposition. When he accepted, Philip Ladley\r\nmaintained that he meant only to carry out the plan as suggested. But\r\nthe temptation was too strong for him. That night, while his wife\r\nslept, he had strangled her.\r\n\r\nI believe he was frantic with fear, after he had done it. Then it\r\noccurred to him that if he made the body unrecognizable, he would be\r\nsafe enough. On that quiet Sunday night, when Mr. Reynolds reported\r\nall peaceful in the Ladley room, he had cut off the poor wretch's head\r\nand had tied it up in a pillow-slip weighted with my onyx clock!\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact about the case that the scar which his wife\r\nincurred to enable her to marry him was the means of his undoing. He\r\ninsisted, and I believe he was telling the truth, that he did not know\r\nof the scar: that is, his wife had never told him of it, and had been\r\nable to conceal it. He thought she had probably used paraffin in some\r\nway.\r\n\r\nIn his final statement, written with great care and no little literary\r\nfinish, he told the story in detail: of arranging the clues as Mr.\r\nHowell and Mr. Bronson had suggested; of going out in the boat, with\r\nthe body, covered with a fur coat, in the bottom of the skiff: of\r\nthrowing it into the current above the Ninth Street bridge, and of\r\nseeing the fur coat fall from the boat and carried beyond his reach;\r\nof disposing of the head near the Seventh Street bridge: of going to a\r\ndrug store, as per the Howell instructions, and of coming home at four\r\no'clock, to find me at the head of the stairs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: While his wife slept.]\r\n\r\nSeveral points of confusion remained. One had been caused by Temple\r\nHope's refusal to admit that the dress and hat that figured in the\r\ncase were to be used by her the next week at the theater. Mr. Ladley\r\ninsisted that this was the case, and that on that Sunday afternoon\r\nhis wife had requested him to take them to Miss Hope; that they had\r\nquarreled as to whether they should be packed in a box or in the brown\r\nvalise, and that he had visited Alice Murray instead. It was on the\r\nway there that the idea of finally getting rid of Jennie Brice came\r\nto him. And a way--using the black and white striped dress of the\r\ndispute.\r\n\r\nAnother point of confusion had been the dismantling of his room that\r\nMonday night, some time between the visit of Temple Hope and the\r\nreturn of Mr. Holcombe. This was to obtain the scrap of paper\r\ncontaining the list of clues as suggested by Mr. Howell, a clue that\r\nmight have brought about a premature discovery of the so-called hoax.\r\n\r\nTo the girl he had told nothing of his plan. But he had told her she\r\nwas to leave town on an early train the next morning, going as his\r\nwife; that he wished her to wear the black and white dress and hat,\r\nfor reasons that he would explain later, and to be veiled heavily,\r\nthat to the young man who would put her on the train, and who had seen\r\nJennie Brice only once, she was to be Jennie Brice; to say as little\r\nas possible and not to raise her veil. Her further instructions were\r\nsimple: to go to the place at Horner where Jennie Brice had planned\r\nto go, but to use the name of \"Bellows\" there. And after she had been\r\nthere for a day or two, to go as quietly as possible to New York. He\r\ngave her the address of a boarding-house where he could write her, and\r\nwhere he would join her later.\r\n\r\nHe reasoned in this way: That as Alice Murray was to impersonate\r\nJennie Brice, and Jennie Brice hiding from her husband, she would\r\nnaturally discard her name. The name \"Bellows\" had been hers by a\r\nprevious marriage and she might easily resume it. Thus, to establish\r\nhis innocence, he had not only the evidence of Howell and Bronson that\r\nthe whole thing was a gigantic hoax; he had the evidence of Howell\r\nthat he had started Jennie Brice to Horner that Monday morning, that\r\nshe had reached Horner, had there assumed an incognito, as Mr.\r\nPitman would say, and had later disappeared from there, maliciously\r\nconcealing herself to work his undoing.\r\n\r\nIn all probability he would have gone free, seeing no one in the\r\nchurch in all that throng but the boy who waited at the end of the\r\nlong church aisle--I wanted to run out and claim her, my own blood, my\r\nmore than child.\r\n\r\nI sat down and covered my face. And from the pew behind me some one\r\nleaned over and patted my shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Bess!\" old Isaac said gently. \"Don't take on, Miss Bess!\"\r\n\r\nHe came the next day and brought me some lilies from the bride's\r\nbouquet, that she had sent me, and a bottle of champagne from the\r\nwedding supper. I had not tasted champagne for twenty years!\r\n\r\nThat is all of the story. On summer afternoons sometimes, when the\r\nhouse is hot, I go to the park and sit. I used to take Peter, but now\r\nhe is dead. I like to see Lida's little boy; the nurse knows me\r\nby sight, and lets me talk to the child. He can say \"Peter\" quite\r\nplainly. But he does not call Alma \"Grandmother.\" The nurse says she\r\ndoes not like it. He calls her \"Nana.\"\r\n\r\nLida does not forget me. Especially at flood-times, apologies, the\r\nchiffon gown her mother had worn at her wedding. Alma had never worn\r\nit but once, and now she was too stout for it. I took it; I am not\r\nproud, and I should like Molly Maguire to see it.\r\n\r\nMr. Holcombe asked me last night to marry him. He says he needs me,\r\nand that I need him.\r\n\r\nI am a lonely woman, and getting old, and I'm tired of watching the\r\ngas meter; and besides, with Peter dead, I need a man in the house all\r\nthe time. The flood district is none too orderly. Besides, when I have\r\na wedding dress laid away and a bottle of good wine, it seems a pity\r\nnot to use them.\r\n\r\nI think I shall do it.\r\n\n", "The After House": "By the bequest of an elder brother, I was left enough money to see me\r\nthrough a small college in Ohio, and to secure me four years in a\r\nmedical school in the East.  Why I chose medicine I hardly know.\r\nPossibly the career of a surgeon attracted the adventurous element in\r\nme.  Perhaps, coming of a family of doctors, I merely followed the line\r\nof least resistance.  It may be, indirectly but inevitably, that I\r\nmight be on the yacht Ella on that terrible night of August 12, more\r\nthan a year ago.\r\n\r\nI got through somehow.  I played quarterback on the football team, and\r\nmade some money coaching.  In summer I did whatever came to hand, from\r\nchartering a sail-boat at a summer resort and taking passengers, at so\r\nmuch a head, to checking up cucumbers in Indiana for a Western pickle\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nI was practically alone.  Commencement left me with a diploma, a new\r\ndress-suit, an out-of-date medical library, a box of surgical\r\ninstruments of the same date as the books, and an incipient case of\r\ntyphoid fever.\r\n\r\nI was twenty-four, six feet tall, and forty inches around the chest.\r\nAlso, I had lived clean, and worked and played hard.  I got over the\r\nfever finally, pretty much all bone and appetite; but--alive. Thanks to\r\nthe college, my hospital care had cost nothing.  It was a good thing: I\r\nhad just seven dollars in the world.\r\n\r\nThe yacht Ella lay in the river not far from my hospital windows. She\r\nwas not a yacht when I first saw her, nor at any time, technically,\r\nunless I use the word in the broad sense of a pleasure-boat.  She was a\r\ntwo-master, and, when I saw her first, as dirty and disreputable as are\r\nmost coasting-vessels.  Her rejuvenation was the history of my\r\nconvalescence.  On the day she stood forth in her first coat of white\r\npaint, I exchanged my dressing-gown for clothing that, however loosely\r\nit hung, was still clothing.  Her new sails marked my promotion to\r\nbeefsteak, her brass rails and awnings my first independent excursion\r\nup and down the corridor outside my door, and, incidentally, my return\r\nto a collar and tie.\r\n\r\nThe river shipping appealed to me, to my imagination, clean washed by\r\nmy illness and ready as a child's for new impressions: liners gliding\r\ndown to the bay and the open sea; shrewish, scolding tugs; dirty but\r\npicturesque tramps.  My enthusiasm amused the nurses, whose ideas of\r\nadventure consisted of little jaunts of exploration into the abdominal\r\ncavity, and whose aseptic minds revolted at the sight of dirty sails.\r\n\r\nOne day I pointed out to one of them an old schooner, red and brown,\r\nwith patched canvas spread, moving swiftly down the river before a\r\nstiff breeze.\r\n\r\n\"Look at her!\" I exclaimed.  \"There goes adventure, mystery, romance!\r\nI should like to be sailing on her.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would have to boil the drinking-water,\" she replied dryly.  \"And\r\nthe ship is probably swarming with rats.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rats,\" I affirmed, \"add to the local color.  Ships are their native\r\nhabitat.  Only sinking ships don't have them.\"\r\n\r\nBut her answer was to retort that rats carried bubonic plague, and to\r\nexit, carrying the sugar-bowl.  I was ravenous, as are all convalescent\r\ntyphoids, and one of the ways in which I eked out my still slender diet\r\nwas by robbing the sugar-bowl at meals.\r\n\r\nThat day, I think it was, the deck furniture was put out on the\r\nElla--numbers of white wicker chairs and tables, with bright cushions\r\nto match the awnings.  I had a pair of ancient opera-glasses, as\r\nobsolete as my amputating knives, and, like them, a part of my\r\nheritage.  By that time I felt a proprietary interest in the Ella, and\r\nthrough my glasses, carefully focused with a pair of scissors, watched\r\nthe arrangement of the deck furnishings.  A girl was directing the men.\r\nI judged, from the poise with which she carried herself, that she was\r\nattractive--and knew it.  How beautiful she was, and how well she knew\r\nit, I was to find out before long. McWhirter to the contrary, she had\r\nnothing to do with my decision to sign as a sailor on the Ella.\r\n\r\nOne of the bright spots of that long hot summer was McWhirter.  We had\r\ngraduated together in June, and in October he was to enter a hospital\r\nin Buffalo as a resident.  But he was as indigent as I, and from June\r\nto October is four months.\r\n\r\n\"Four months,\" he said to me.  \"Even at two meals a day, boy, that's\r\nsomething over two hundred and forty.  And I can eat four times a day,\r\nwithout a struggle!  Wouldn't you think one of these\r\noverworked-for-the-good-of-humanity dubs would take a vacation and give\r\nme a chance to hold down his practice?\"\r\n\r\nNothing of the sort developing, McWhirter went into a drug-store, and\r\nmanaged to pull through the summer with unimpaired cheerfulness,\r\nconfiding to me that he secured his luncheons free at the soda counter.\r\nHe came frequently to see me, bringing always a pocketful of chewing\r\ngum, which he assured me was excellent to allay the gnawings of hunger,\r\nand later, as my condition warranted it, small bags of gum-drops and\r\nother pharmacy confections.\r\n\r\nMcWhirter it was who got me my berth on the Ella.  It must have been\r\nabout the 20th of July, for the Ella sailed on the 28th.  I was strong\r\nenough to leave the hospital, but not yet physically able for any\r\nprolonged exertion.  McWhirter, who was short and stout, had been\r\nalternately flirting with the nurse, as she moved in and out preparing\r\nmy room for the night, and sizing me up through narrowed eyes.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said, evidently following a private line of thought; \"you\r\ndon't belong behind a counter, Leslie.  I'm darned if I think you\r\nbelong in the medical profession, either.  The British army'd suit you.\"\r\n\r\n\"The--what?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know--Kipling idea--riding horseback, head of a column--undress\r\nuniform--colonel's wife making eyes at you--leading last hopes and all\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"The British army with Kipling trimmings being out of the question, the\r\noriginal issue is still before us.  I'll have to work, Mac, and work\r\nlike the devil, if I'm to feed myself.\"\r\n\r\nThere being no answer to this, McWhirter contented himself with eyeing\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"I'm thinking,\" I said, \"of going to Europe.  The sea is calling me,\r\nMac.\"\r\n\r\n\"So was the grave a month ago, but it didn't get you.  Don't be an ass,\r\nboy.  How are you going to sea?\"\r\n\r\n\"Before the mast.\"  This apparently conveying no meaning to McWhirter,\r\nI supplemented--\"as a common sailor.\"\r\n\r\nHe was indignant at first, offering me his room and a part of his small\r\nsalary until I got my strength; then he became dubious; and finally, so\r\nwell did I paint my picture of long, idle days on the ocean, of sweet,\r\ncool nights under the stars, with breezes that purred through the\r\nsails, rocking the ship to slumber--finally he waxed enthusiastic, and\r\nwas even for giving up the pharmacy at once and sailing with me.\r\n\r\nHe had been fitting out the storeroom of a sailing-yacht with drugs, he\r\ninformed me, and doing it under the personal direction of the owner's\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n\"I've made a hit with her,\" he confided.  \"Since she's learned I'm a\r\ngraduate M.D., she's letting me do the whole thing.  I've made up some\r\nlotions to prevent sunburn, and that seasick prescription of old\r\nLarimer's, and she thinks I'm the whole cheese.  I'll suggest you as\r\nship's doctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many men in the crew?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eight, I think, or ten.  It's a small boat, and carries a small crew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then they don't want a ship's doctor.  If I go, I'll go as a sailor,\"\r\nI said firmly.  \"And I want your word, Mac, not a word about me, except\r\nthat I am honest.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to wash decks, probably.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am filled with a wild longing to wash decks,\" I asserted, smiling at\r\nhis disturbed face.  \"I should probably also have to polish brass.\r\nThere's a great deal of brass on the boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that?\"\r\n\r\nWhen I told him, he was much excited, and, although it was dark and the\r\nElla consisted of three lights, he insisted on the opera-glasses, and\r\nwas persuaded he saw her.  Finally he put down the glasses and came\r\nover, to me.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you are right, Leslie,\" he said soberly.  \"You don't want\r\ncharity, any more than they want a ship's doctor.  Wherever you go and\r\nwhatever you do, whether you're swabbing decks in your bare feet or\r\npolishing brass railings with an old sock, you're a man.\"\r\n\r\nHe was more moved than I had ever seen him, and ate a gum-drop to cover\r\nhis embarrassment.  Soon after that he took his departure, and the\r\nfollowing day he telephoned to say that, if the sea was still calling\r\nme, he could get a note to the captain recommending me.  I asked him to\r\nget the note.\r\n\r\nGood old Mac!  The sea was calling me, true enough, but only dire\r\nnecessity was driving me to ship before the mast--necessity and perhaps\r\nwhat, for want of a better name, we call destiny.  For what is fate but\r\ninevitable law, inevitable consequence.\r\n\r\nThe stirring of my blood, generations removed from a seafaring\r\nancestor; my illness, not a cause, but a result; McWhirter, filling\r\nprescriptions behind the glass screen of a pharmacy, and fitting out,\r\nin porcelain jars, the medicine-closet of the Ella; Turner and his\r\nwife, Schwartz, the mulatto Tom, Singleton, and Elsa Lee; all thrown\r\ntogether, a hodge-podge of characters, motives, passions, and\r\nhereditary tendencies, through an inevitable law working together\r\ntoward that terrible night of August 22, when hell seemed loose on a\r\npainted sea.\r\n\nThe Ella had been a coasting-vessel, carrying dressed lumber to South\r\nAmerica, and on her return trip bringing a miscellaneous cargo--hides\r\nand wool, sugar from Pernambuco, whatever offered. The firm of Turner\r\nand Sons owned the line of which the Ella was one of the smallest\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nThe gradual elimination of sailing ships and the substitution of\r\nsteamers in the coasting trade, left the Ella, with others, out of\r\ncommission.  She was still seaworthy, rather fast, as such vessels go,\r\nand steady.  Marshall Turner, the oldest son of old Elias Turner, the\r\nfounder of the business, bought it in at a nominal sum, with the\r\nintention of using it as a private yacht.  And, since it was a\r\nsuperstition of the house never to change the name of one of its\r\nvessels, the schooner Ella, odorous of fresh lumber or raw rubber, as\r\nthe case might be, dingy gray in color, with slovenly decks on which\r\nlines of seamen's clothing were generally hanging to dry, remained, in\r\nher metamorphosis, still the Ella.\r\n\r\nMarshall Turner was a wealthy man, but he equipped his new\r\npleasure-boat very modestly.  As few changes as were possible were\r\nmade.  He increased the size of the forward house, adding quarters for\r\nthe captain and the two mates, and thus kept the after house for\r\nhimself and his friends.  He fumigated the hold and the forecastle--a\r\nprecaution that kept all the crew coughing for two days, and drove them\r\nout of the odor of formaldehyde to the deck to sleep.  He installed an\r\nelectric lighting and refrigerating plant, put a bath in the\r\nforecastle, to the bewilderment of the men, who were inclined to think\r\nit a reflection on their habits, and almost entirely rebuilt, inside,\r\nthe old officers' quarters in the after house.\r\n\r\nThe wheel, replaced by a new one, white and gilt, remained in its old\r\nposition behind the after house, the steersman standing on a raised\r\niron grating above the wash of the deck.  Thus from the chart-room,\r\nwhich had become a sort of lounge and card-room, through a small barred\r\nwindow it was possible to see the man at the wheel, who, in his turn,\r\ncommanded a view of part of the chartroom, but not of the floor.\r\n\r\nThe craft was schooner-rigged, carried three lifeboats and a\r\ncollapsible raft, and was navigated by a captain, first and second\r\nmates, and a crew of six able-bodied sailors and one gaunt youth whose\r\nsole knowledge of navigation had been gained on an Atlantic City\r\ncatboat.  Her destination was vague--Panama perhaps, possibly a South\r\nAmerican port, depending on the weather and the whim of the owner.\r\n\r\nI do not recall that I performed the nautical rite of signing articles.\r\nArmed with the note McWhirter had secured for me, and with what I\r\nfondly hoped was the rolling gait of the seafaring man, I approached\r\nthe captain--a bearded and florid individual.  I had dressed the\r\npart--old trousers, a cap, and a sweater from which I had removed my\r\ncollege letter, McWhirter, who had supervised my preparations, and who\r\nhad accompanied me to the wharf, had suggested that I omit my morning\r\nshave.  The result was, as I look back, a lean and cadaverous six-foot\r\nyouth, with the hospital pallor still on him, his chin covered with a\r\nday's beard, his hair cropped short, and a cannibalistic gleam in his\r\neyes.  I remember that my wrists, thin and bony, annoyed me, and that\r\nthe girl I had seen through the opera-glasses came on board, and stood\r\noff, detached and indifferent, but with her eyes on me, while the\r\ncaptain read my letter.\r\n\r\nWhen he finished, he held it out to me.\r\n\r\n\"I've got my crew,\" he said curtly.\r\n\r\n\"There isn't--I suppose there's no chance of your needing another hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\" He turned away, then glanced back at the letter I was still\r\nholding, rather dazed.  \"You can leave your name and address with the\r\nmate over there.  If anything turns up he'll let you know.\"\r\n\r\nMy address!  The hospital?\r\n\r\nI folded the useless letter and thrust it into my pocket.  The captain\r\nhad gone forward, and the girl with the cool eyes was leaning against\r\nthe rail, watching me.\r\n\r\n\"You are the man Mr.  McWhirter has been looking after, aren't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" I pulled off my cap, and, recollecting myself--\"Yes, miss.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not a sailor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have had some experience--and I am willing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been ill, haven't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--miss.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could you polish brass, and things like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could try.  My arms are strong enough.  It is only when I walk--\"\r\n\r\nBut she did not let me finish.  She left the rail abruptly, and\r\ndisappeared down the companionway into the after house.  I waited\r\nuncertainly.  The captain saw me still loitering, and scowled.  A\r\nprocession of men with trunks jostled me; a colored man, evidently a\r\nbutler, ordered me out of his way while he carried down into the cabin,\r\nwith almost reverent care, a basket of wine.\r\n\r\nWhen the girl returned, she came to me, and stood for a moment, looking\r\nme over with cool, appraising eyes.  I had been right about her\r\nappearance: she was charming--or no, hardly charming.  She was too\r\naloof for that.  But she was beautiful, an Irish type, with blue-gray\r\neyes and almost black hair.  The tilt of her head was haughty.  Later I\r\ncame to know that her hauteur was indifference: but at first I was\r\nfrankly afraid of her, afraid of her cool, mocking eyes and the upward\r\nthrust of her chin.\r\n\r\n\"My brother-in-law is not here,\" she said after a moment, \"but my\r\nsister is below in the cabin.  She will speak to the captain about you.\r\nWhere are your things?\"\r\n\r\nI glanced toward the hospital, where my few worldly possessions,\r\nincluding my dress clothes, my amputating set, and such of my books as\r\nI had not been able to sell, were awaiting disposition.  \"Very near,\r\nmiss,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Better bring them at once; we are sailing in the morning.\"  She turned\r\naway as if to avoid my thanks, but stopped and came back.\r\n\r\n\"We are taking you as a sort of extra man,\" she explained.  \"You will\r\nwork with the crew, but it is possible that we will need you--do you\r\nknow anything about butler's work?\"\r\n\r\nI hesitated.  If I said yes, and then failed--\r\n\r\n\"I could try.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought, from your appearance, perhaps you had done something of the\r\nsort.\"  Oh, shades of my medical forebears, who had bequeathed me,\r\nalong with the library, what I had hoped was a professional manner!\r\n\"The butler is a poor sailor.  If he fails us, you will take his place.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave a curt little nod of dismissal, and I went down the gangplank\r\nand along the wharf.  I had secured what I went for; my summer was\r\nprovided for, and I was still seven dollars to the good. I was\r\nexultant, but with my exultation was mixed a curious anger at\r\nMcWhirter, that he had advised me not to shave that morning.\r\n\r\nMy preparation took little time.  Such of my wardrobe as was worth\r\nsaving, McWhirter took charge of.  I sold the remainder of my books,\r\nand in a sailor's outfitting-shop I purchased boots and slickers--the\r\nsailors' oil skins.  With my last money I bought a good revolver,\r\nsecond-hand, and cartridges.  I was glad later that I had bought the\r\nrevolver, and that I had taken with me the surgical instruments,\r\nantiquated as they were, which, in their mahogany case, had accompanied\r\nmy grandfather through the Civil War, and had done, as he was wont to\r\nchuckle, as much damage as a three-pounder.  McWhirter came to the\r\nwharf with me, and looked the Ella over with eyes of proprietorship.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty snappy-looking boat,\" he said.  \"If the nigger gets sick, give\r\nhim some of my seasick remedy.  And take care of yourself, boy.\" He\r\nshook hands, his open face flushed with emotion.  \"Darned shame to see\r\nyou going like this.  Don't eat too much, and don't fall in love with\r\nany of the women.  Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nHe started away, and I turned toward the ship; but a moment later I\r\nheard him calling me.  He came back, rather breathless.\r\n\r\n\"Up in my neighborhood,\" he panted, \"they say Turner is a devil.\r\nWhatever happens, it's not your mix-in.  Better--better tuck your gun\r\nunder your mattress and forget you've got it.  You've got some\r\ndisposition yourself.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ella sailed the following day at ten o'clock.  She carried nineteen\r\npeople, of whom five were the Turners and their guests. The cabin was\r\nfull of flowers and steamer-baskets.\r\n\r\nThirty-one days later she came into port again, a lifeboat covered with\r\ncanvas trailing at her stern.\r\n\nFrom the first the captain disclaimed responsibility for me.  I was\r\nhoused in the forecastle, and ate with the men.  There, however, my\r\nconnection with the crew and the navigation of the ship ended. Perhaps\r\nit was as well, although I resented it at first.  I was weaker than I\r\nhad thought, and dizzy at the mere thought of going aloft.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, I found myself a sort of deck-steward, given the\r\nresponsibility of looking after the shuffle-board and other deck games,\r\nthe steamer-rugs, the cards,--for they played bridge steadily,--and\r\nanswerable to George Williams, the colored butler, for the various\r\nliquors served on deck.\r\n\r\nThe work was easy, and the situation rather amused me.  After an effort\r\nor two to bully me, one of which resulted in my holding him over the\r\nrail until he turned gray with fright, Williams treated me as an equal,\r\nwhich was gratifying.\r\n\r\nThe weather was good, the food fair.  I had no reason to repent my\r\nbargain.  Of the sailing qualities of the Ella there could be no\r\nquestion.  The crew, selected by Captain Richardson from the best men\r\nof the Turner line, knew their business, and, especially after the\r\nWilliams incident, made me one of themselves.  Barring the odor of\r\nformaldehyde in the forecastle, which drove me to sleeping on deck for\r\na night or two, everything was going smoothly, at least on the surface.\r\n\r\nSmoothly as far as the crew was concerned.  I was not so sure about the\r\nafter house.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, owing to the small size, of the vessel, and the fact\r\nthat considerable of the space had been used for baths, there were,\r\nbesides the family, only two guests, a Mrs. Johns, a divorcee, and a\r\nMr. Vail.  Mrs. Turner and Miss Lee shared the services of a maid,\r\nKaren Hansen, who, with a stewardess, Henrietta Sloane, occupied a\r\ndouble cabin.  Vail had a small room, as had Turner, with a bath\r\nbetween which they used in common.  Mrs. Turner's room was a large one,\r\nwith its own bath, into which Elsa Lee's room also opened. Mrs. Johns\r\nhad a room and bath.  Roughly, and not drawn to scale, the living\r\nquarters of the family were arranged like the diagram in chapter XIX.\r\n\r\nI have said that things were not going smoothly in the after house. I\r\nfelt it rather than, saw it.  The women rose late--except Miss Lee, who\r\nwas frequently about when I washed the deck.  They chatted and laughed\r\ntogether, read, played bridge when the men were so inclined, and now\r\nand then, when their attention was drawn to it, looked at the sea.\r\nThey were always exquisitely and carefully dressed, and I looked at\r\nthem as I would at any other masterpieces of creative art, with nothing\r\nof covetousness in my admiration.\r\n\r\nThe men were violently opposed types. Turner, tall, heavy-shouldered,\r\nmorose by habit, with a prominent nose and rapidly thinning hair, and\r\nwith strong, pale blue eyes, congested from hard drinking; Vail,\r\nshorter by three inches, dark, good-looking, with that dusky flush\r\nunder the skin which shows good red blood, and as temperate as Turner\r\nwas dissipated.\r\n\r\nVail was strong, too.  After I had held Williams over the rail I turned\r\nto find him looking on, amused.  And when the frightened darky had\r\ntaken himself, muttering threats, to the galley, Vail came over to me\r\nand ran his hand down my arm.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get it?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I've always had some muscle,\" I said.  \"I'm in bad shape now; just\r\ngetting over fever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fever, eh?  I thought it was jail.  Look here.\"\r\n\r\nHe threw out his biceps for me to feel.  It was a ball of iron under my\r\nfingers.  The man was as strong as an ox.  He smiled at my surprise,\r\nand, after looking to see that no one was in sight, offered to mix me a\r\nhighball from a decanter and siphon on a table.\r\n\r\nI refused.\r\n\r\nIt was his turn to be surprised.\r\n\r\n\"I gave it up when I was in train--in the hospital,\" I corrected\r\nmyself.  \"I find I don't miss it.\"\r\n\r\nHe eyed me with some curiosity over his glass, and, sauntering away,\r\nleft me to my work of folding rugs.  But when I had finished, and was\r\nchalking the deck for shuffle-board, he joined me again, dropping his\r\nvoice, for the women had come up by that time and were breakfasting on\r\nthe lee side of the after house.\r\n\r\n\"Have you any idea, Leslie, how much whiskey there is on board?\"\r\n\r\n\"Williams has considerable, I believe.  I don't think there is any in\r\nthe forward house.  The captain is a teetotaler.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see.  When these decanters go back, Williams takes charge of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  He locks them away.\"\r\n\r\nHe dropped his voice still lower.\r\n\r\n\"Empty them, Leslie,\" he said.  \"Do you understand?  Throw what is left\r\noverboard.  And, if you get a chance at Williams's key, pitch a dozen\r\nor two quarts overboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"And be put in irons!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not necessarily.  I think you understand me.  I don't trust Williams.\r\nIn a week we could have this boat fairly dry.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a great deal of wine.\"\r\n\r\nHe scowled.  \"Damn Williams, anyhow! His instructions were--but never\r\nmind about that.  Get rid of the whiskey.\"\r\n\r\nTurner coming up the companionway at that moment, Vail left me.  I had\r\nunderstood him perfectly.  It was common talk in the forecastle that\r\nTurner was drinking hard, and that, in fact, the cruise had been\r\narranged by his family in the hope that, away from his clubs; he would\r\nalter his habits--a fallacy, of course.  Taken away from his customary\r\ndaily round, given idle days on a summer sea, and aided by Williams,\r\nthe butler, he was drinking his head off.\r\n\r\nEarly as it was, he was somewhat the worse for it that morning. He made\r\ndirectly for me.  It was the first time he had noticed me, although it\r\nwas the third day out.  He stood in front of me, his red eyes flaming,\r\nand, although I am a tall man, he had an inch perhaps the advantage of\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"What's this about Williams?\" he demanded furiously.  \"What do you mean\r\nby a thing like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was bullying me.  I didn't intend to drop him.\"\r\n\r\nThe ship was rolling gently; he made a pass at me with a magazine he\r\ncarried, and almost lost his balance.  The women had risen, and were\r\nwatching from the corner of the after house.  I caught him and steadied\r\nhim until he could clutch a chair.\r\n\r\n\"You try any tricks like that again, and you'll go overboard,\" he\r\nstormed.  \"Who are you, anyhow?  Not one of our men?\"\r\n\r\nI saw the quick look between Vail and Mrs. Turner, and saw her come\r\nforward.  Mrs. Johns followed her, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Marsh!\" Mrs. Turner protested.  \"I told you about him--the man who had\r\nbeen ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, another of your friends!\" he sneered, and looked from me to Vail\r\nwith his ugly smile.\r\n\r\nVail went rather pale and threw up his head quickly.  The next moment\r\nMrs. Johns had saved the situation with an irrelevant remark, and the\r\nincident was over.  They were playing bridge, not without dispute, but\r\nat least without insult.  But I had hard a glimpse beneath the surface\r\nof that luxurious cruise, one of many such in the next few days.\r\n\r\nThat was on Monday, the third day out.  Up to that time Miss Lee had\r\nnot noticed me, except once, when she found me scrubbing the deck, to\r\ncomment on a corner that she thought might be cleaner, and another time\r\nin the evening, when she and Vail sat in chairs until late, when she\r\nhad sent me below for a wrap.  She looked past me rather than at me,\r\ngave me her orders quietly but briefly, and did not even take the\r\ntrouble to ignore me.  And yet, once or twice, I had found her eyes\r\nfixed on me with a cool, half-amused expression, as if she found\r\nsomething in my struggles to carry trays as if I had been accustomed to\r\nthem, or to handle a mop as a mop should be handled and not like a\r\nhockey stick--something infinitely entertaining and not a little absurd.\r\n\r\nBut that morning, after they had settled to bridge, she followed me to\r\nthe rail, out of earshot I straightened and took off my cap, and she\r\nstood looking at me, unsmiling.\r\n\r\n\"Unclench your hands!\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon!\" I straightened out my fingers, conscious for the\r\nfirst time of my clenched fists, and even opened and closed them once\r\nor twice to prove their relaxation.\r\n\r\n\"That's better.  Now--won't you try to remember that I am responsible\r\nfor your being here, and be careful?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then take me away from here and put me with the crew.  I am stronger\r\nnow.  Ask the captain to give me a man's work.  This--this is a\r\nhousemaid's occupation.\"\r\n\r\n\"We prefer to have you here,\" she said coldly; and then, evidently\r\nrepenting her manner: \"We need a man here, Leslie.  Better stay. Are\r\nyou comfortable in the forecastle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss Lee.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the food is all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"The cook says I am eating two men's rations.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned to leave, smiling.  It was the first time she had thrown\r\neven a fleeting smile my way, and it went to my head.\r\n\r\n\"And Williams?  I am to submit to his insolence?\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped and turned, and the smile faded.\r\n\r\n\"The next time,\" she said, \"you are to drop him!\"\r\n\r\nBut during the remainder of the day she neither spoke to me nor looked,\r\nas far as I could tell, in my direction.  She flirted openly with Vail,\r\nrather, I thought, to the discomfort of Mrs. Johns, who had\r\nappropriated him to herself--sang to him in the cabin, and in the long\r\nhour before dinner, when the others were dressing, walked the deck with\r\nhim, talking earnestly.  They looked well together, and I believe he\r\nwas in love with her.  Poor Vail!\r\n\r\nTurner had gone below, grimly good-humored, to dress for dinner; and I\r\nwent aft to chat, as I often did, with the steersman.  On this occasion\r\nit happened to be Charlie Jones.  Jones was not his name, so far as I\r\nknow.  It was some inordinately long and different German inheritance,\r\nand so, with the facility of the average crew, he had been called\r\nJones.  He was a benevolent little man, highly religious, and something\r\nof a philosopher.  And because I could understand German, and even\r\nessay it in a limited way, he was fond of me.\r\n\r\n\"Seta du dick,\" he said, and moved over so that I could sit on the\r\ngrating on which he stood.  \"The sky is fine to-night.  Wunderschon!\"\r\n\r\n\"It always looks good to me,\" I observed, filling my pipe and passing\r\nmy tobacco-bag to him.  \"I may have my doubts now and then on land,\r\nCharlie; but here, between the sky and the sea, I'm a believer, right\r\nenough.\"\r\n\r\n\"'In the beginning He created the heaven and the earth,'\" said Charlie\r\nreverently.\r\n\r\nWe were silent for a time.  The ship rolled easily; now and then she\r\ndipped her bowsprit with a soft swish of spray; a school of dolphins\r\nplayed astern, and the last of the land birds that had followed us out\r\nflew in circles around the masts.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes,\" said Charlie Jones, \"I think the Good Man should have left\r\nit the way it was after the flood just sky and water.  What's the land,\r\nanyhow?  Noise and confusion, wickedness and crime, robbing the widow\r\nand the orphan, eat or be et.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I argued, \"the sea's that way.  What are those fish out there\r\nflying for, but to get out of the way of bigger fish?\"\r\n\r\nCharlie Jones surveyed me over his pipe.\r\n\r\n\"True enough, youngster,\" he said; \"but the Lord's given 'em wings to\r\nfly with.  He ain't been so careful with the widow and the orphan.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement being incontrovertible, I let the argument lapse, and\r\nsat quiet, luxuriating in the warmth, in the fresh breeze, in the\r\nfeeling of bodily well-being that came with my returning strength. I\r\ngot up and stretched, and my eyes fell on the small window of the\r\nchart-room.\r\n\r\nThe door into the main cabin beyond was open.  It was dark with the\r\nsummer twilight, except for the four rose-shaded candles on the table,\r\nnow laid for dinner.  A curious effect it had--the white cloth and\r\ngleaming pink an island of cheer in a twilight sea; and to and from\r\nthis rosy island, making short excursions, advancing, retreating,\r\ndisappearing at times, the oval white ship that was Williams's shirt\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\nCharlie Jones, bending to the right and raised to my own height by the\r\ngrating on which he stood, looked over my shoulder.  Dinner was about\r\nto be served.  The women had come out.  The table-lamps threw their\r\nrosy glow over white necks and uncovered arms, and revealed, higher in\r\nthe shadows, the faces of the men, smug, clean-shaven, assured, rather\r\nheavy.\r\n\r\nI had been the guest of honor on a steam-yacht a year or two before,\r\nafter a game.  There had been pink lights on the table, I remembered,\r\nand the place-cards at dinner the first night out had been caricatures\r\nof me in fighting trim.  There had been a girl, too. For the three days\r\nof that week-end cruise I had been mad about her; before that first\r\ndinner, when I had known her two hours, I had kissed her hand and told\r\nher I loved her!\r\n\r\nVail and Miss Lee had left the others and come into the chart-room. As\r\nCharlie Jones and I looked, he bent over and kissed her hand.\r\n\r\nThe sun had gone down.  My pipe was empty, and from the galley,\r\nforward, came the odor of the forecastle supper.  Charlie was coughing,\r\na racking paroxysm that shook his wiry body.  He leaned over and caught\r\nmy shoulder as I was moving away.\r\n\r\n\"New paint and new canvas don't make a new ship,\" he said, choking back\r\nthe cough.  \"She's still the old Ella, the she-devil of the Turner\r\nline.  Pink lights below, and not a rat in the hold!  They left her\r\nbefore we sailed, boy.  Every rope was crawling with 'em.\"\r\n\r\n                      \"The very rats\r\n                      Instinctively had left it,\"\r\n\r\nI quoted.  But Charlie, clutching the wheel, was coughing again, and\r\ncursing breathlessly as he coughed.\r\n\nThe odor of formaldehyde in the forecastle having abated, permission\r\nfor the crew to sleep on deck had been withdrawn.  But the weather as\r\nwe turned south had grown insufferably hot.  The reek of the forecastle\r\nsickened me--the odor of fresh paint, hardly dry, of musty clothing and\r\nsweaty bodies.\r\n\r\nI asked Singleton, the first mate, for permission to sleep on deck, and\r\nwas refused.  I went down, obediently enough, to be driven back with\r\nnausea.  And so, watching my chance, I waited until the first mate, on\r\nwatch, disappeared into the forward cabin to eat the night lunch always\r\nprepared by the cook and left there.  Then, with a blanket and pillow,\r\nI crawled into the starboard lifeboat, and settled myself for the\r\nnight.  The lookout saw me, but gave no sign.\r\n\r\nIt was not a bad berth.  As the ship listed, the stars seemed to sway\r\nabove me, and my last recollection was of the Great Dipper, performing\r\ndignified gyrations in the sky.\r\n\r\nI was aroused by one of the two lookouts, a young fellow named Burns.\r\nHe was standing below, rapping on the side of the boat with his\r\nknuckles.  I sat up and peered over at him, and was conscious for the\r\nfirst time that the weather had changed.  A fine rain was falling; my\r\nhair and shirt were wet.\r\n\r\n\"Something doing in the chart-room,\" he said cautiously.  \"Thought you\r\nmight not want to miss it.\"\r\n\r\nHe was in his bare feet, as was I.  Together we hurried to the after\r\nhouse.  The steersman, in oilskins, was at his post, but was peering\r\nthrough the barred window into the chart-room, which was brilliantly\r\nlighted.  He stepped aside somewhat to let us look in. The loud and\r\nfurious voices which had guided us had quieted, but the situation had\r\nnot relaxed.\r\n\r\nSingleton, the first mate, and Turner were sitting at a table littered\r\nwith bottles and glasses, and standing over them, white with fury, was\r\nCaptain Richardson.  In the doorway to the main cabin, dressed in\r\npajamas and a bathrobe, Vail was watching the scene.\r\n\r\n\"I told you last night, Mr. Turner,\" the captain said, banging the\r\ntable with his fist, \"I won't have you interfering with my officers, or\r\nwith my ship.  That man's on duty, and he's drunk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your ship!\" Turner sneered thickly.  \"It's my ship, and I--I discharge\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nHe got to his feet, holding to the table.  \"Mr. Singleton--hic--from\r\nnow on you're captain.  Captain Singleton! How--how d'ye like it?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Vail came forward, the only cool one of the four.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a fool, Marsh,\" he protested.  \"Come to bed.  The captain's\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\nTurner turned his pale-blue eyes on Vail, and they were as full of\r\ndanger as a snake's.  \"You go to hell!\" he said.  \"Singleton, you're\r\nthe captain, d'ye hear? If Rich--if Richardson gets funny, put him--in\r\nirons.\"\r\n\r\nSingleton stood up, with a sort of swagger.  He wes less intoxicated\r\nthan Turner, but ugly enough.  He faced the captain with a leer.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, old fellow,\" he said, \"but you heard what Turner said!\"\r\n\r\nThe captain drew a deep breath.  Then, without any warning, he leaned\r\nacross the table and shot out his clenched fist.  It took the mate on\r\nthe point of the chin, and he folded up in a heap on the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Good old boy!\" muttered Burns, beside me.  \"Good old boy!\"\r\n\r\nTurner picked up a bottle from the table, and made the same\r\nincoordinate pass with it at the captain as he had at me the morning\r\nbefore with his magazine.  The captain did not move.  He was a big man,\r\nand he folded his arms with their hairy wrists across his chest.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Turner,\" he said, \"while we are on the sea I am in command here.\r\nYou know that well enough.  You are drunk to-night; in the morning you\r\nwill be sober; and I want you to remember what I am going to say. If\r\nyou interfere again--with--me--or--my\r\nofficers--I--shall--put--you--in--irons.\"\r\n\r\nHe started for the after companionway, and Burns and I hurried forward\r\nout of his way, Burns to the lookout, I to make the round of the after\r\nhouse and bring up, safe from detection, by the wheel again.  The mate\r\nwas in a chair, looking sick and dazed, and Turner and Vail were\r\nconfronting each other.\r\n\r\n\"You know that is a lie,\" Vail was saying.  \"She is faithful to you, as\r\nfar as I know, although I'm damned if I know why.\"  He turned to the\r\nmate roughly: \"Better get out in the air.\"\r\n\r\nOnce again I left my window to avoid discovery.  The mate, walking\r\nslowly, made his way up the companionway to the rail.  The man at the\r\nwheel reported in the forecastle, when he came down at the end of his\r\nwatch, that Singleton had seemed dazed, and had stood leaning against\r\nthe rail for some time, occasionally cursing to himself; that the\r\nsecond mate had come on deck, and had sent him to bed; and that the\r\ncaptain was shut in his cabin with the light going.\r\n\r\nThere was much discussion of the incident among the crew.  Sympathy was\r\nwith the captain, and there was a general feeling that the end had not\r\ncome.  Charlie Jones, reading his Bible on the edge of his bunk, voiced\r\nthe general belief.\r\n\r\n\"Knowin' the Turners, hull and mast,\" he said, \"and having sailed with\r\nCaptain Richardson off and on for ten years, the chances is good of our\r\nhaving a hell of a time.  It ain't natural, anyhow, this voyage with no\r\nrats in the hold, and all the insects killed with this here\r\nformaldehyde, and ice-cream sent to the fo'c'sle on Sundays!\"\r\n\r\nBut at first the thing seemed smoothed over.  It is true that the\r\ncaptain did not speak to the first mate except when compelled to, and\r\nthat Turner and the captain ignored each other elaborately. The cruise\r\nwent on without event.  There was no attempt on Turner's part to carry\r\nout his threat of the night before; nor did he, as the crew had\r\nprophesied, order the Ella into the nearest port.  He kept much to\r\nhimself, spending whole days below, with Williams carrying him\r\nhighballs, always appearing at dinner, however, sodden of face but\r\nimmaculately dressed, and eating little or nothing.\r\n\r\nA week went by in this fashion, luring us all to security.  I was still\r\nlean but fairly strong again.  Vail, left to himself or to the women of\r\nthe party, took to talking with me now and then.  I thought he was\r\nuneasy.  More than once he expressed a regret that he had taken the\r\ncruise, laying his discontent to the long inaction. But the real reason\r\nwas Turner's jealousy of him, the obsession of the dipsomaniac.  I knew\r\nit, and Vail knew that I knew.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th we encountered bad weather, the first wind of the cruise.\r\nAll hands were required for tacking, and I was stationed on the\r\nforecastle-head with one other man.  Williams, the butler, succumbed to\r\nthe weather, and at five o'clock Miss Lee made her way forward through\r\nthe driving rain, and asked me if I could take his place.\r\n\r\n\"If the captain needs you, we can manage,\" she said.  \"We have\r\nHenrietta and Karen, the two maids.  But Mr. Turner prefers a man to\r\nserve.\"\r\n\r\nI said that I was probably not so useful that I could not be spared,\r\nand that I would try.  Vail's suggestion had come back to me, and this\r\nwas my chance to get Williams's keys.  Miss Lee having spoken to the\r\ncaptain, I was relieved from duty, and went aft with her. What with the\r\nplunging of the vessel and the slippery decks, she almost fell twice,\r\nand each time I caught her.\r\n\r\nThe second time, she wrenched her ankle, and stood for a moment holding\r\nto the rail, while I waited beside her.  She wore a heavy ulster of\r\nsome rough material, and a small soft hat of the same material, pulled\r\nover her ears.  Her soft hair lay wet across her forehead.\r\n\r\n\"How are you liking the sea, Leslie?\" she said, after she had tested\r\nher ankle and found the damage inconsiderable.\r\n\r\n\"Very much, Miss Lee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you intend to remain a--a sailor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not a sailor.  I am a deck steward, and I am about to become a\r\nbutler.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was our agreement,\" she flashed at me.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.  And to know that I intend to fulfill it to the letter, I\r\nhave only to show this.\"\r\n\r\nIt had been one of McWhirter's inspirations, on learning how I had been\r\nengaged, the small book called \"The Perfect Butler.\"  I took it from\r\nthe pocket of my flannel shirt, under my oilskins, and held it out to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"I have not got very far,\" I said humbly.  \"It's not inspiring reading.\r\nI've got the wine glasses straightened out, but it seems a lot of fuss\r\nabout nothing.  Wine is wine, isn't it?  What difference, after all,\r\ndoes a hollow stem or green glass make--\"\r\n\r\nThe rain was beating down on us.  The \"Perfect Butler\" was weeping\r\ntears; as its chart of choice vintages was mixed with water.  Miss Lee\r\nlooked up, smiling, from the book.\r\n\r\n\"You prefer 'a jug of wine,\"' she said.\r\n\r\n\"Old Omar had the right idea; only I imagine, literally, it was a skin\r\nof wine.  They didn't have jugs, did they?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know the 'Rubaiyat'?\" she asked slowly.\r\n\r\n\"I know the jug of wine and loaf of bread part,\" I admitted, irritated\r\nat the slip.  \"In my home city they're using it to advertise a\r\nparticular sort of bread.  You know--'A book of verses underneath the\r\nbough, a loaf of Wiggin's home-made bread, and thou.\"'\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, in spite of the absurd verse, of the pouring rain,\r\nof the fact that I was shortly to place her dinner before her in the\r\ncapacity of upper servant, I thrilled to the last two words.\r\n\r\n\"'And thou,'\" I repeated.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at me, startled, and for a second our glances held. The\r\nnext moment she was gone, and I was alone on a rain swept deck, cursing\r\nmy folly.\r\n\r\nThat night, in a white linen coat, I served dinner in the after house.\r\nThe meal was unusually gay, rendered so by the pitching of the boat and\r\nthe uncertainty of the dishes.  In the general hilarity, my awkwardness\r\nwent unnoticed.  Miss Lee, sitting beside Vail, devoted herself to him.\r\nMrs. Johns, young and blonde, tried to interest Turner, and, failing in\r\nthat, took to watching me, to my discomfiture.  Mrs. Turner, with\r\napprehensive eyes on her husband, ate little and drank nothing.\r\n\r\nDinner over in the main cabin, they lounged into the chart-room--except\r\nMrs. Johns, who, following them to the door, closed it behind them and\r\ncame back.  She held a lighted cigarette, and she stood just outside\r\nthe zone of candlelight, watching me through narrowed eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You got along very well to-night,\" she observed.  \"Are you quite\r\nstrong again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite strong, Mrs. Johns.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have never done this sort of thing before, have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Butler's work? No--but it is rather simple.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought perhaps you had,\" she said.  \"I seem to recall you,\r\nvaguely--that is, I seem to remember a crowd of people, and a noise--I\r\ndare say I did see you in a crowd somewhere.  You know, you are rather\r\nan unforgettable type.\"\r\n\r\nI was nonplused as to how a butler would reply to such a statement, and\r\ntook refuge in no reply at all.  As it happened, none was needed. The\r\nship gave a terrific roll at that moment, and I just saved the\r\nChartreuse as it was leaving the table.  Mrs. Johns was holding to a\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\"Well caught,\" she smiled, and, taking a fresh cigarette, she bent over\r\na table-lamp and lighted it herself.  All the time her eyes were on me,\r\nI felt that she was studying one over her cigarette, with something in\r\nview.\r\n\r\n\"Is it still raining?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mrs. Johns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you get a wrap from Karen and bring it to me on deck? I--I want\r\nair to-night.\"\r\n\r\nThe forward companionway led down into the main cabin.  She moved\r\ntoward it, her pale green gown fading into the shadow.  At the foot of\r\nthe steps she turned and looked back at me.  I had been stupid enough,\r\nbut I knew then that she had something to say to me, something that she\r\nwould not trust to the cabin walls.  I got the wrap.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting in a deck-chair when I found her, on the lee side of\r\nthe after house, a position carefully chosen, with only the storeroom\r\nwindows behind.  I gave her the wrap, and she flung it over her without\r\nrising.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, Leslie,\" she said, pointing to the chair beside her.  And,\r\nas I hesitated, \"Don't be silly, boy.  Else Lee and her sister may be\r\nas blind as they like.  You are not a sailor, or a butler, either. I\r\ndon't care what you are: I'm not going to ask any questions.  Sit down;\r\nI have to talk to some one.\"\r\n\r\nI sat on the edge of the chair, somewhat uneasy, to tell the truth. The\r\ncrew were about on a night like that, and at any moment Elsa Lee might\r\navail herself of the dummy hand, as she sometimes did, and run up for a\r\nbreath of air or a glimpse of the sea.\r\n\r\n\"Just now, Mrs. Johns;\" I said, \"I am one of the crew of the Ella, and\r\nif I am seen here--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, fudge!\" she retorted impatiently.  \"My reputation isn't going to\r\nbe hurt, and the man's never is.  Leslie, I am frightened--you know\r\nwhat I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Turner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean--with the captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"With any one who happens to be near.  He is dangerous.  It is Vail\r\nnow.  He thinks Mr. Vail is in love with his wife.  The fact is that\r\nVail--well, never mind about that.  The point is this: this afternoon\r\nhe had a dispute with Williams, and knocked him down.  The other women\r\ndon't know it.  Vail told me.  We have given out that Williams is\r\nseasick.  It will be Vail next, and, if he puts a hand on him, Vail\r\nwill kill him; I know him.\"\r\n\r\n\"We could stop this drinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have him shoot up the ship!  I have been thinking all evening, and\r\nonly one thing occurs to me.  We are five women and two men, and Vail\r\nrefuses to be alarmed.  I want you to sleep in the after house.  Isn't\r\nthere a storeroom where you could put a cot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I agreed, \"and I'll do it, of course, if you are uneasy, but I\r\nreally think--\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind what you really think.  I haven't slept for three nights,\r\nand I'm showing it.\"  She made a motion to rise, and I helped her up.\r\nShe was a tall woman, and before I knew it she had put both her hands\r\non my shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"You are a poor butler, and an indifferent sailor, I believe,\" she\r\nsaid, \"but you are rather a dear.  Thank you.\"\r\n\r\nShe left me, alternately uplifted and sheepish.  But that night I took\r\na blanket and a pillow into the storeroom, and spread my six feet of\r\nlength along the greatest diameter of a four-by-seven pantry.\r\n\r\nAnd that night, also, between six and seven bells, with the storm\r\nsubsided and only a moderate sea, Schwartz, the second mate, went\r\noverboard--went without a cry, without a sound.\r\n\r\nSingleton, relieving him at four o'clock, found his cap lying near\r\nstarboard, just forward of the after house.  The helmsman and the two\r\nmen in the lookout reported no sound of a struggle.  The lookout had\r\nseen the light of his cigar on the forecastle-head at six bells (three\r\no'clock).  At seven bells he had walked back to the helmsman and\r\ncommented cheerfully on the break in the weather.  That was the last\r\nseen of him.\r\n\r\nThe alarm was raised when Singleton went on watch at four o'clock. The\r\nElla was heaved to and the lee boat lowered.  At the same time\r\nlife-buoys were thrown out, and patent lights.  But the early summer\r\ndawn revealed a calm ocean; and no sign of the missing mate.\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock the order was reluctantly given to go on.\r\n\nWith the disappearance of Schwartz, the Ella was short-handed: I\r\nbelieve Captain Richardson made an attempt to secure me to take the\r\nplace of Burns, now moved up into Schwartz's position.  But the attempt\r\nmet with a surly refusal from Turner.\r\n\r\nThe crew was plainly nervous and irritable.  Sailors are simple-minded\r\nmen, as a rule; their mental processes are elemental. They began to\r\nmutter that the devil-ship of the Turner line was at her tricks again.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, going into the forecastle for some of my clothing, I\r\nfound a curious group.  Gathered about the table were Tom, the mulatto\r\ncook, a Swede named Oleson, Adams, and Burns of the crew. At the head\r\nof the table Charlie Jones was reading the service for the burial of\r\nthe dead at sea.  The men were standing, bareheaded. I took off my cap\r\nand stood, just inside the door, until the simple service was over.  I\r\nwas strongly moved.\r\n\r\nSchwartz disappeared in the early morning of August 9.  And now I come,\r\nnot without misgiving, to the night of August 12.  I am wondering if,\r\nafter all, I have made clear the picture that is before my eyes: the\r\nlanguid cruise, the slight relaxation of discipline, due to the leisure\r\nof a pleasure voyage, the Ella again rolling gently, with hardly a dash\r\nof spray to show that she was moving, the sun beating down on her white\r\ndecks and white canvas, on the three women in summer attire, on\r\nunending-bridge, with its accompaniment of tall glasses filled with\r\nice, on Turner's morose face and Vail's watchful one.  In the\r\nforecastle, much gossip and not a little fear, and in the forward\r\nhouse, where Captain Richardson and Singleton had their quarters,\r\nveiled hostility and sullen silence.\r\n\r\nAugust 11 was Tuesday, a hot August day, with only enough air going to\r\nkeep our sails filled.  At five o'clock I served afternoon tea, and\r\nshortly after I went to Williams's cabin in the forward house to dress\r\nthe wound in his head, a long cut, which was now healing.  I passed the\r\ncaptain's cabin, and heard him quarreling with the first mate, who was\r\nreplying, now and then, sullenly.  Only the tones of their voices\r\nreached me.\r\n\r\nWhen I had finished with Williams, and was returning, the quarrel was\r\nstill going on.  Their voices ceased as I passed the door, and there\r\nwas a crash, as of a chair violently overturned.  The next bit I heard.\r\n\r\n\"Put that down!\" the captain roared.\r\n\r\nI listened, uncertain whether to break in or not.  The next moment,\r\nSingleton opened the door and saw me.  I went on as if I had heard\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, the day was much as other days.  Turner ate no dinner that\r\nnight.  He was pale, and twitching; even with my small experience, I\r\nknew he was on the verge of delirium tremens.  He did not play cards,\r\nand spent much of the evening wandering restlessly about on deck.  Mrs.\r\nTurner retired early.  Mrs. Johns played accompaniments for Vail to\r\nsing to, in the chart-room, until something after eleven, when they,\r\ntoo, went to their rooms.\r\n\r\nIt being impracticable for me to go to my quarters in the storeroom\r\nuntil the after house was settled, I went up on deck.  Miss Lee had her\r\narm through Turner's and was talking to him.  He seemed to be listening\r\nto her; but at last he stopped and freed his arm, not ungently.\r\n\r\n\"That all sounds very well, Elsa,\" he said, \"but you don't know what\r\nyou are talking about.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not a fool--or blind.\"\r\n\r\nHe lurched down the companionway and into the cabin.  I heard her draw\r\na long breath; then she turned and saw me.\r\n\r\n\"Is that you, Leslie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss Lee.\"\r\n\r\nShe came toward me, the train of her soft white gown over her arm, and\r\nthe light from a lantern setting some jewels on her neck to glittering.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Johns has told me where you are sleeping.  You are very good to\r\ndo it, although I think she is rather absurd.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to do anything I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure of that.  You are certain you are comfortable there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then--good-night.  And thank you.\"\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly she put out her hand, and I took it.  It was the first\r\ntime I had touched her, and it went to my head.  I bent over her slim\r\ncold fingers and kissed them.  She drew her breath in sharply in\r\nsurprise, but as I dropped her hand our eyes met.\r\n\r\n\"You should not have done that,\" she said coolly.  \"I am sorry.\"\r\n\r\nShe left me utterly wretched.  What a boor she must have thought me, to\r\nmisconstrue her simple act of kindness!  I loathed myself with a hatred\r\nthat sent me groveling to my blanket in the pantry, and that kept me,\r\nonce there, awake through all the early part of the summer night.\r\n\r\nI wakened with a sense of oppression, of smothering heat.  I had\r\nstruggled slowly back to consciousness, to realize that the door of the\r\npantry was closed, and that I was stewing in the moist heat of the\r\nAugust night.  I got up, clad in my shirt and trousers, and felt my way\r\nto the door.\r\n\r\nThe storeroom and pantry of the after house had been built in during\r\nthe rehabilitation of the boat, and consisted of a short passageway,\r\nwith drawers for linens on either side, and beyond, lighted by a\r\nporthole, the small supply room in which I had been sleeping.\r\n\r\nAlong this passageway; then, I groped my way to the door at the end,\r\nopening into the main cabin near the chart-room door and across from\r\nMrs. Turner's room.  This door I had been in the habit of leaving open,\r\nfor two purposes--ventilation, and in case I might be, as Mrs. Johns\r\nhad feared, required in the night.\r\n\r\nThe door was locked on the outside.\r\n\r\nI was a moment or two in grasping the fact.  I shook it carefully to\r\nsee if it had merely caught, and then, incredulous, I put my weight to\r\nit.  It refused to yield.  The silence outside was absolute.\r\n\r\nI felt my way back to the window.  It was open, but was barred with\r\niron, and, even without that, too small for my shoulders.  I listened\r\nfor the mate.  It was still dark, and so not yet time for the watch to\r\nchange.  Singleton would be on duty, and he rarely came aft.  There was\r\nno sound of footsteps.\r\n\r\nI lit a match and examined the lock.  It was a simple one, and as my\r\nidea now was to free myself without raising an alarm, I decided to\r\nunscrew it with my pocket-knife.  I was still confused, but inclined to\r\nconsider my imprisonment a jest, perhaps on the part of Charlie Jones,\r\nwho tempered his religious fervor with a fondness for practical joking.\r\n\r\nI accordingly knelt in front of the lock and opened my knife.  I was in\r\ndarkness and working by touch.  I had extracted one screw, and, with a\r\ngrowing sense of satisfaction, was putting it in my pocket before\r\nloosening a second, when a board on which I knelt moved under my knee,\r\nlifted, as if the other end, beyond the door, had been stepped on.\r\nThere was no sound, no creak.  Merely that ominous lifting under my\r\nknee.  There was some one just beyond the door.\r\n\r\nA moment later the pressure was released.  With a growing horror of I\r\nknow not what, I set to work at the second screw, trying to be\r\nnoiseless, but with hands shaking with excitement.  The screw fell out\r\ninto my palm.  In my haste I dropped my knife, and had to grope for it\r\non the floor.  It was then that a woman screamed--a low, sobbing cry,\r\nbroken off almost before it began.  I had got my knife by that time,\r\nand in desperation I threw myself against the door. It gave way, and I\r\nfell full length on the main cabin floor.  I was still in darkness.\r\nThe silence in the cabin was absolute.  I could hear the steersman\r\nbeyond the chart-room scratching a match.\r\n\r\nAs I got up, six bells struck.  It was three o'clock.\r\n\r\nVail's room was next to the pantry, and forward.  I felt my way to it,\r\nand rapped.\r\n\r\n\"Vail,\" I called.  \"Vail!\"\r\n\r\nHis door was open an inch or so.  I went in and felt my way to his\r\nbunk.  I could hear him breathing, a stertorous respiration like that\r\nof sleep, and yet unlike.  The moment I touched him, the sound ceased,\r\nand did not commence again.  I struck a match and bent over him.\r\n\r\nHe had been almost cut to pieces with an axe.\r\n\nThe match burnt out, and I dropped it.  I remember mechanically\r\nextinguishing the glowing end with my heel, and then straightening to\r\nsuch a sense of horror as I have never felt before or since.  I groped\r\nfor the door; I wanted air, space, the freedom from lurking death of\r\nthe open deck.\r\n\r\nI had been sleeping with my revolver beside me on the pantry floor.\r\nSomehow or other I got back there and found it.  I made an attempt to\r\nfind the switch for the cabin lights, and, failing, revolver in hand, I\r\nran into the chart-room and up the after companionway. Charlie Jones\r\nwas at the wheel, and by the light of a lantern I saw that he was\r\nbending to the right, peering in at the chartroom window. He turned\r\nwhen he heard me.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong?\" he asked.  \"I heard a yell a minute ago.  Turner on the\r\nrampage?\"  He saw my revolver then, and, letting go the wheel, threw up\r\nboth his hands.  \"Turn that gun away, you fool!\"\r\n\r\nI could hardly speak.  I lowered the revolver and gasped: \"Call the\r\ncaptain!  Vail's been murdered!\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" he said.  \"Who did it?\"  He had taken the wheel again, and\r\nwas bringing the ship back to her course.  I was turning sick and\r\ndizzy, and I clutched at the railing of the companionway.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.  Where's the captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"The mate's around.\" He raised his voice.  \"Mr. Singleton!\" he called.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to lose, I felt.  My nausea had left me.  I ran\r\nforward to where I could dimly see Singleton looking in my direction.\r\n\r\n\"Singleton!  Quick!\" I called.  \"Bring your revolver.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped and peered in my direction.\r\n\r\n\"Who is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Leslie.  Come below, for God's sake!\"\r\n\r\nHe came slowly toward me, and in a dozen words I told him what had\r\nhappened.  I saw then that he had been drinking.  He reeled against me,\r\nand seemed at a loss to know what to do.\r\n\r\n\"Get your revolver,\" I said, \"and wake the captain.\"\r\n\r\nHe disappeared into the forward house, to come back a moment later with\r\na revolver.  I had got a lantern in the mean time, and ran to the\r\nforward companionway which led into the main cabin.  Singleton followed\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"Where's the captain?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't call him,\" Singleton replied, and muttered something\r\nunintelligible under his breath.\r\n\r\nSwinging the lantern ahead of me, I led the way down the companionway.\r\nSomething lay huddled at the foot.  I had to step over it to get down.\r\nSingleton stood above, on the steps.  I stooped and held the lantern\r\nclose, and we both saw that it was the captain, killed as Vail had\r\nbeen.  He was fully dressed except for his coat, and as he lay on his\r\nback, his cap had been placed over his mutilated face.\r\n\r\nI thought I heard something moving behind me in the cabin, and wheeled\r\nsharply, holding my revolver leveled.  The idea had come to me that the\r\ncrew had mutinied, and that every one in the after house had been\r\nkilled.  The idea made me frantic; I thought of the women, of Elsa Lee,\r\nand I was ready to kill.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the light switch?\" I demanded of Singleton, who was still on\r\nthe companion steps, swaying.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" he said, and collapsed, sitting huddled just above the\r\ncaptain's body, with his face in his hands.\r\n\r\nI saw I need not look to him for help, and I succeeded in turning on\r\nthe light in the swinging lamp in the center of the cabin.  There was\r\nno sign of any struggle, and the cabin was empty.  I went back to the\r\ncaptain's body, and threw a rug over it.  Then I reached over and shook\r\nSingleton by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Do something!\" I raved.  \"Call the crew.  Get somebody here, you\r\ndrunken fool!\"\r\n\r\nHe rose and staggered up the companionway, and I ran to Miss Lee's\r\ndoor.  It was closed and locked, as were all the others except Vail's\r\nand the one I had broken open.  I reached Mr. Turner's door last.  It\r\nwas locked, and I got no response to my knock.  I remembered that his\r\nroom and Vail's connected through a bath, and, still holding my\r\nrevolver leveled, I ran into Vail's room again, this time turning on\r\nthe light.\r\n\r\nA night light was burning in the bath-room, and the door beyond was\r\nunlocked.  I flung it open and stepped in.  Turner was lying on his\r\nbed, fully dressed, and at first I thought he too had been murdered.\r\nBut he was in a drunken stupor.  He sat up, dazed, when I shook him by\r\nthe arm.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Turner!\" I cried.  \"Try to rouse yourself, man!  The captain has\r\nbeen murdered, and Mr. Vail!\"\r\n\r\nHe made an effort to sit up, swayed, and fell back again.  His face was\r\nswollen and purplish, his eyes congested.  He made an effort to speak,\r\nbut failed to be intelligible.  I had no time to waste. Somewhere on\r\nthe Ella the murderer was loose.  He must be found.\r\n\r\nI flung out of Turner's cabin as the crew, gathered from the forecastle\r\nand from the decks, crowded down the forward companionway. I ran my eye\r\nover them.  Every man was there, Singleton below by the captain's body,\r\nthe crew, silent and horror-struck, grouped on the steps: Clarke,\r\nMcNamara, Burns, Oleson, and Adams.  Behind the crew, Charlie Jones had\r\nleft the wheel and stood peering down, until sharply ordered back.\r\nWilliams, with a bandage on his head, and Tom, the mulatto cook, were\r\nin the group.\r\n\r\nI stood, revolver in hand, staring at the men.  Among them, I felt\r\nsure, was the murderer.  But which one?  All were equally pale, equally\r\nterrified.\r\n\r\n\"Boys,\" I said, \"Mr. Vail and your captain have been murdered.  The\r\nmurderer must be on the ship--one of ourselves.\"  There was a murmur at\r\nthat.  \"Mr. Singleton, I suggest that these men stay together in a\r\nbody, and that no one be allowed to go below until all have been\r\nsearched and all weapons taken from them.\"\r\n\r\nSingleton had dropped into a chair, and sat with his face buried in his\r\nhands, his back to the captain's body.  He looked up without moving,\r\nand his face was gray.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he said.  \"Do as you like.  I'm sick.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked sick.  Burns, who had taken Schwartz's place as second mate,\r\nleft the group and came toward me.\r\n\r\n\"We'd better waken the women,\" he said.  \"If you'll tell them, Leslie,\r\nI'll take the crew on deck and keep them there.\"\r\n\r\nSingleton seemed dazed, and when Burns spoke of taking the men on deck,\r\nhe got up dizzily.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going too,\" he muttered.  \"I'll go crazy if I stay down here with\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\nThe rug had been drawn back to show the crew what had happened. I drew\r\nit reverently over the body again.\r\n\r\nAfter the men had gone, I knocked at Mrs. Turner's door.  It was some\r\ntime before she roused; when she answered, her voice was startled.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's Leslie, Mrs. Turner.  Will you come to the door?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a moment.\"\r\n\r\nShe threw on a dressing-gown, and opened the door.\r\n\r\n\"What is wrong?\"\r\n\r\nI told her, as gently as I could.  I thought she would faint; but she\r\npulled herself together and looked past me into the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"That is--?\"\r\n\r\n\"The captain, Mrs. Turner.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Mr. Vail?\"\r\n\r\n\"In his cabin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is Mr. Turner?\"\r\n\r\n\"In his cabin, asleep.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at me strangely, and, leaving the door, went into her\r\nsister's room, next.  I heard Miss Lee's low cry of horror, and almost\r\nimmediately the two women came to the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen Mr. Turner?\" Miss Lee demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Just now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has Mrs. Johns been told?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet.\"\r\n\r\nShe went herself to Mrs. Johns's cabin, and knocked.  She got an\r\nimmediate answer, and Mrs. Johns, partly dressed, opened the door.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" she demanded.  \"The whole crew is tramping outside\r\nmy windows.  I hope we haven't struck an iceberg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Adele, don't faint, please.  Something awful has happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Turner!  He has killed some one finally!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, for Heaven's sake!  Wilmer has been murdered, Adele--and the\r\ncaptain.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Johns had less control than the other women.  She stood for an\r\ninstant, with a sort of horrible grin on her face.  Then she went down\r\non the floor, full length, with a crash.  Elsa Lee knelt beside her and\r\nslid a pillow under her head.\r\n\r\n\"Call the maids, Leslie,\" she said quietly.  \"Karen has something for\r\nthis sort of thing.  Tell her to bring it quickly.\"\r\n\r\nI went the length of the cabin and into the chartroom.  The maids' room\r\nwas here, on the port-side, and thus aft of Mrs. Turner's and Miss\r\nLee's rooms.  It had one door only, and two small barred windows, one\r\nabove each of the two bunks.\r\n\r\nI turned on the chart-room lights.  At the top of the after\r\ncompanionway the crew had been assembled, and Burns was haranguing\r\nthem.  I knocked at the maids' door, and, finding it unlocked, opened\r\nit an inch or so.\r\n\r\n\"Karen!\" I called--and, receiving no answer: \"Mrs. Sloane!\" (the\r\nstewardess).\r\n\r\nI opened the door wide and glanced in.  Karen Hansen, the maid, was on\r\nthe floor, dead.  The stewardess, in collapse from terror, was in her\r\nbunk, uninjured.\r\n\nI went to the after companionway and called up to the men to send the\r\nfirst mate down; but Burns came instead.\r\n\r\n\"Singleton's sick,\" he explained.  \"He's up there in a corner, with\r\nOleson and McNamara holding him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Burns,\" I said cautiously--\"I've found another!\"\r\n\r\n\"God, not one of the women!\"\r\n\r\n\"One of the maids--Karen.\"\r\n\r\nBurns was a young fellow about my own age, and to this point he had\r\nstood up well.  But he had been having a sort of flirtation with the\r\ngirl, and I saw him go sick with horror.  He wanted to see her, when he\r\nhad got command of himself; but I would not let him enter the room.  He\r\nstood outside, while I went in and carried out the stewardess, who was\r\ncoming to and moaning.  I took her forward, and told the three women\r\nthere what I had found.\r\n\r\nMrs. Johns was better, and I found them all huddled in her room.  I put\r\nthe stewardess on the bed, and locked the door into the next room.\r\nThen, after examining the window, I gave Elsa Lee my revolver.\r\n\r\n\"Don't let any one in,\" I said.  \"I'll put a guard at the two\r\ncompanionways, and we'll let no one down.  But keep the door locked\r\nalso.\"\r\n\r\nShe took the revolver from me, and examined it with the air of one\r\nfamiliar with firearms.  Then she looked up at me, her lips as white as\r\nher face.\r\n\r\n\"We are relying on you, Leslie,\" she said.\r\n\r\nAnd, at her words, the storm of self-contempt and bitterness that I had\r\nbeen holding in abeyance for the last half hour swept over me like a\r\nflood.  I could have wept for fury.\r\n\r\n\"Why should you trust me?\" I demanded.  \"I slept through the time when\r\nI was needed.  And when I wakened and found myself locked in the\r\nstoreroom, I waited to take the lock off instead of breaking down the\r\ndoor!  I ought to jump overboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are relying on you,\" she said again, simply; and I heard her fasten\r\nthe door behind me as I went out.\r\n\r\nDawn was coming as I joined the crew, huddled around the wheel. There\r\nwere nine men, counting Singleton.  But Singleton hardly counted.  He\r\nwas in a state of profound mental and physical collapse.  The Ella was\r\nwithout an accredited officer, and, for lack of orders to the contrary,\r\nthe helmsman--McNamara now--was holding her to her course.  Burns had\r\ntaken Schwartz's place as second mate, but the situation was clearly\r\nbeyond him.  Turner's condition was known and frankly discussed.  It\r\nwas clear that, for a time at least, we would have to get along without\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nCharlie Jones, always an influence among the men, voiced the situation\r\nas we all stood together in the chill morning air:\r\n\r\n\"What we want to do, boys,\" he said, \"is to make for the nearest port.\r\nThis here is a police matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a hanging matter,\" someone else put in.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to remember, boys, that this ain't like a crime on land.\r\nWe've got the fellow that did it.  He's on the boat all right.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a stirring among the men, and some of them looked aft to\r\nwhere, guarded by the Swede Oleson, Singleton was sitting, his head in\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\n\"And, what's more,\" Charlie Jones went on, \"I'm for putting Leslie here\r\nin charge--for now, anyhow.  That's agreeable to you, is it, Burns?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't know anything about a ship,\" I objected.  \"I'm willing\r\nenough, but I'm not competent.\"\r\n\r\nI believe the thing had been discussed before I went up, for McNamara\r\nspoke up from the wheel.\r\n\r\n\"We'll manage that somehow or other, Leslie,\" he said.  \"We want\r\nsomebody to take charge, somebody with a head, that's all.  And since\r\nyou ain't, in a manner of speaking, been one of us, nobody's feelings\r\ncan't be hurt.  Ain't that it, boys?\"\r\n\r\n\"That, and a matter of brains,\" said Burns.\r\n\r\n\"But Singleton?\" I glanced aft.\r\n\r\n\"Singleton is going in irons,\" was the reply I got.\r\n\r\nThe light was stronger now, and I could see their faces.  It was clear\r\nthat the crew, or a majority of the crew, believed him guilty, and\r\nthat, as far as Singleton was concerned, my authority did not exist.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" I said.  \"I'll do the best I can.  First of all, I want\r\nevery man to give up his weapons.  Burns!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go over each man.  Leave them their pocket-knives; take everything\r\nelse.\"\r\n\r\nThe men lined up.  The situation was tense, horrible, so that the\r\nmiscellaneous articles from their pockets--knives, keys, plugs of\r\nchewing tobacco, and here and there, among the foreign ones, small\r\ncombs for beard and mustache unexpectedly brought to light, caused a\r\nsmile of pure reaction.  Two revolvers from Oleson and McNamara and one\r\nnicked razor from Adams completed the list of weapons we found.  The\r\ncrew submitted willingly.  They seemed relieved to have some one to\r\ndirect them, and the alacrity with which they obeyed my orders showed\r\nhow they were suffering under the strain of inaction.\r\n\r\nI went over to Singleton and put my hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, Mr. Singleton,\" I said, \"but I'll have to ask you for your\r\nrevolver.\"\r\n\r\nWithout looking at me, he drew it from his hip pocket and held it out.\r\nI took it: It was loaded.\r\n\r\n\"It's out of order,\" he said briefly.  \"If it had been working right, I\r\nwouldn't be here.\"\r\n\r\nI reached down and touched his wrist.  His pulse was slow and rather\r\nfaint, his hands cold.\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything I can do for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he snarled.  \"You can get me a belaying-pin and let me at those\r\nfools over there.  Turner did this, and you know it as well as I do!\"\r\n\r\nI slid his revolver into my pocket, and went back to the men. Counting\r\nWilliams and the cook and myself, there were nine of us. The cook I\r\ncounted out, ordering him to go to the galley and prepare breakfast.\r\nThe eight that were left I divided into two watches, Burns taking one\r\nand I the other.  On Burns's watch were Clarke, McNamara, and Williams;\r\non mine, Oleson, Adams, and Charlie Jones.\r\n\r\nIt was two bells, or five o'clock.  Burns struck the gong sharply as an\r\nindication that order, of a sort, had been restored.  The rising sun\r\nwas gleaming on the sails; the gray surface of the sea was ruffling\r\nunder the morning breeze.  From the galley a thin stream of smoke was\r\nrising.  Some of the horror of the night went with the darkness, but\r\nthe thought of what waited in the cabin below was on us all.\r\n\r\nI suggested another attempt to rouse Mr. Turner, and Burns and Clarke\r\nwent below.  They came back in ten minutes, reporting no change in\r\nTurner's condition.  There was open grumbling among the men at the\r\nsituation, but we were helpless.  Burns and I decided to go on as if\r\nTurner were not on board, until he was in condition to take hold.\r\n\r\nWe thought it best to bring up the bodies while all the crew was on\r\nduty, and then to take up the watches.  I arranged to have one man\r\nconstantly on guard in the after house--a difficult matter where all\r\nwere under suspicion.  Burns suggested Charlie Jones as probably the\r\nmost reliable, and I gave him the revolver I had taken from Singleton.\r\nIt was useless, but it made at least a show of authority. The rest of\r\nthe crew, except Oleson, on guard over the mate, was detailed to assist\r\nin carrying up the three bodies.  Williams was taken along to get\r\nsheets from the linen room.\r\n\r\nWe brought the captain up first, laying him on a sheet on the deck and\r\nfolding the edges over him.  It was terrible work.  Even I, fresh from\r\na medical college, grew nauseated over it.  He was heavy. It was slow\r\nwork, getting him up.  Vail we brought up in the sheets from his bunk.\r\nOf the three, he was the most mutilated.  The maid Karen showed only\r\none injury, a smashing blow on the head, probably from the head of the\r\naxe.  For axe it had been, beyond a doubt.  I put Williams to work\r\nbelow to clear away every evidence of what had happened.  He went down,\r\nashy-faced, only to rush up again, refusing to stay alone.  I sent\r\nClarke with him, and instructed Charlie Jones to keep them there until\r\nthe cabin was in order.\r\n\r\nAt three bells the cook brought coffee, and some of the men took it. I\r\ntried to swallow, but it choked me.\r\n\r\nBurns had served as second mate on a sailing vessel, and thought he\r\ncould take us back, at least into more traveled waters.  We decided to\r\nhead back to New York.  I got the code book from the captain's cabin,\r\nand we agreed to run up the flag, union down, if any other vessel came\r\nin sight.  I got the code word for \"Mutiny--need assistance,\" and I\r\nasked the mate if he would signal if a vessel came near enough.  But he\r\nturned sullen and refused to answer.\r\n\r\nI find it hard to recap calmly the events of that morning: the three\r\nstill and shrouded figures, prone on deck; the crew, bareheaded,\r\nstanding around, eyeing each other stealthily, with panic ready to leap\r\nfree and grip each of them by the throat; the grim determination, the\r\nreason for which I did not yet know, to put the first mate in irons;\r\nand, over all, the clear sunrise of an August morning on the ocean,\r\nrails and decks gleaming, an odor of coffee in the air, the joyous lift\r\nand splash of the bowsprit as the Ella, headed back on her course,\r\nseemed to make for home like a nag for the stable.\r\n\r\nSurely none of these men, some weeping, all grieving, could be the\r\nfiend who had committed the crimes.  One by one, I looked in their\r\nfaces--at Burns, youngest member of the crew, a blue-eyed, sandy-haired\r\nScot; at Clarke and Adams and Charlie Jones, old in the service of the\r\nTurner line; at McNamara, a shrewd little Irishman; at Oleson the\r\nSwede.  And, in spite of myself, I could not help comparing them with\r\nthe heavy-shouldered, sodden-faced man below in his cabin, the owner of\r\nthe ship.\r\n\r\nOne explanation came to me, and I leaped at it--the possibility of a\r\nstowaway hidden in the hold, some maniacal fugitive who had found in\r\nthe little cargo boat's empty hull ample room to hide.  The men, too,\r\nseized at the idea.  One and all volunteered for what might prove to be\r\na dangerous service.\r\n\r\nI chose Charlie Jones and Clarke as being most familiar with the ship,\r\nand we went down into the hold.  Clarke carried a lantern.  Charlie\r\nJones held Singleton's broken revolver.  I carried a belaying pin. But,\r\nalthough we searched every foot of space, we found nothing.  The\r\nformaldehyde with which Turner had fumigated the ship clung here\r\ntenaciously, and, mixed with the odors of bilge water and the\r\nindescribable heavy smells left by tropical cargoes, made me dizzy and\r\nill.\r\n\r\nWe were stumbling along, Clarke with the lantern, I next, and Charlie\r\nJones behind, on our way to the ladder again, when I received a\r\nstunning blow on the back of the head.  I turned dizzy, expecting\r\nnothing less than sudden death, when it developed that Jones, having\r\nstumbled over a loose plank, had fallen forward, the revolver in his\r\noutstretched hand striking my head.\r\n\r\nHe picked himself up sheepishly, and we went on.  But so unnerved was I\r\nby this fresh shock that it was a moment or two before I could essay\r\nthe ladder.\r\n\r\nBurns was waiting at the hatchway, peering down.  Beside him on the\r\ndeck lay a bloodstained axe.\r\n\r\nElsa Lee, on hearing the story of Henrietta Sloane, had gone to the\r\nmaids' cabin, and had found it where it had been flung into the berth\r\nof the stewardess.\r\n\nBut, after all, the story of Henrietta Sloane only added to the\r\nmystery.  She told it to me, sitting propped in a chair in Mrs. Johns's\r\nroom, her face white, her lips dry and twitching.  The crew were making\r\nsuch breakfast as they could on deck, and Mr. Turner was still in a\r\nstupor in his room across the main cabin.  The four women, drawn\r\ntogether in their distress, were huddled in the center of the room,\r\ntouching hands now and then, as if finding comfort in contact, and\r\nreassurance.\r\n\r\n\"I went to bed early,\" said the stewardess; \"about ten o'clock, I\r\nthink.  Karen had not come down; I wakened when the watch changed. It\r\nwas hot, and the window from our room to the deck was open.  There is a\r\ncurtain over it, to keep the helmsman from looking in--it is close to\r\nthe wheel.  The bell, striking every half-hour, does not waken me any\r\nmore, although it did at first.  It is just outside the window.  But I\r\nheard the watch change.  I heard eight bells struck, and the lookout\r\nman on the forecastle head call, 'All's well.'\r\n\r\n\"I sat up and turned on the lights.  Karen had not come down, and I was\r\nalarmed.  She had been--had been flirting a little with one of the\r\nsailors, and I had warned her that it would not do.  She'd be found out\r\nand get into trouble.\r\n\r\n\"The only way to reach our cabin was through the chart-room, and when I\r\nopened the door an inch or two, I saw why Karen had not come down.  Mr.\r\nTurner and Mr. Singleton were sitting there.  They were--\" She\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Please go on,\" said Mrs. Turner.  \"They were drinking?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mrs. Turner.  And Mr. Vail was there, too.  He was saying that\r\nthe captain would come down and there would be more trouble.  I shut\r\nthe door and stood just inside, listening.  Mr. Singleton said he hoped\r\nthe captain would come--that he and Mr. Turner only wanted a chance to\r\nget at him.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Lee leaned forward and searched the stewardess's face with\r\nstrained eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You are sure that he mentioned Mr. Turner in that?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was exactly what he said, Miss Lee.  The captain came down just\r\nthen, and ordered Mr. Singleton on deck.  I think he went, for I did\r\nnot hear his voice again.  I thought, from the sounds, that Mr. Vail\r\nand the captain were trying to get Mr. Turner to his room.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Johns had been sitting back, her eyes shut, holding a bottle of\r\nsalts to her nose.  Now she looked up.\r\n\r\n\"My dear woman,\" she said, \"are you trying to tell us that we slept\r\nthrough all that?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you did not hear it, you must have slept,\" the stewardess persisted\r\nobstinately.  \"The door into the main cabin was closed. Karen came down\r\njust after.  She was frightened.  She said the first mate was on deck,\r\nin a terrible humor; and that Charlie Jones, who was at the wheel, had\r\nappealed to Burns not to leave him there--that trouble was coming.\r\nThat must have been at half-past twelve. The bell struck as she put out\r\nthe light.  We both went to sleep then, until Mrs. Turner's ringing for\r\nKaren roused us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I did not ring for Karen.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman stared at Mrs. Turner.\r\n\r\n\"But the bell rang, Mrs. Turner.  Karen got up at once and, turning on\r\nthe light, looked at the clock.  'What do you think of that?' she said.\r\n'Ten minutes to three, and I'd just got to sleep!'  I growled about the\r\nlight, and she put it out, after she had thrown on a wrapper.  The room\r\nwas dark when she opened the door.  There was a little light in the\r\nchart-room, from the binnacle lantern.  The door at the top of the\r\ncompanionway was always closed at night; the light came through the\r\nwindow near the wheel.\"\r\n\r\nShe had kept up very well to this point, telling her story calmly and\r\nkeeping her voice down.  But when she reached the actual killing of the\r\nDanish maid, she went to pieces.  She took to shivering violently, and\r\nher pulse, under my fingers, was small and rapid.  I mixed some\r\naromatic spirits with water and gave it to her, and we waited until she\r\ncould go on.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, then, I realized that I was clad only in shirt and\r\ntrousers, with a handkerchief around my head where the accident in the\r\nhold had left me with a nasty cut.  My bare feet were thrust into\r\ndown-at-the-heel slippers.  I saw Miss Lee's eyes on me, and colored.\r\n\r\n\"I had forgotten,\" I said uncomfortably.  \"I'll have time to find my\r\ncoat while she is recovering.  I have been so occupied--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a fool,\" Mrs. Johns said brusquely.  \"No one cares how you\r\nlook.  We only thank Heaven you are alive to look after us.  Do you\r\nknow what we have been doing, locked in down here?  We have been--\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, Adele!\" said Elsa Lee.  And Mrs. Johns, shrugging her\r\nshoulders, went back to her salts.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the story we got slowly.  Briefly, it was this.  Karen,\r\nhaving made her protest at being called at such an hour, had put on a\r\nwrapper and pinned up her hair.  The light was on.  The stewardess said\r\nshe heard a curious chopping sound in the main cabin, followed by a\r\nfall, and called Karen's attention to it.  The maid, impatient and\r\ndrowsy, had said it was probably Mr. Turner falling over something, and\r\nthat she hoped she would not meet him.  Once or twice, when he had been\r\ndrinking, he had made overtures to her, and she detested him.\r\n\r\nThe sound outside ceased.  It was about five minutes since the bell had\r\nrung, and Karen yawned and sat down on the bed.  \"I'll let her ring\r\nagain,\" she said.  \"If she gets in the habit of this sort of thing, I'm\r\ngoing to leave.\"  The stewardess asked her to put out the light and let\r\nher sleep, and Karen did so.  The two women were in darkness, and the\r\nstewardess dozed, for a minute only.  She was awakened by Karen\r\ntouching her on the shoulder and whispering close to her ear.\r\n\r\n\"That beast is out there,\" she said.  \"I peered out, and I think he is\r\nsitting on the companion steps.  You listen, and if he tries to stop me\r\nI'll call you.\"\r\n\r\nThe stewardess was wide awake by that time.  She thought perhaps the\r\nbell, instead of coming from Mrs. Turner's room, had come from the room\r\nadjoining Turner's, where Vail slept, and which had been originally\r\ndesigned for Mrs. Turner.  She suggested turning on the light again and\r\nlooking at the bell register; but Karen objected.\r\n\r\nThe stewardess sat up in her bed, which was the one under the small\r\nwindow opening on the deck aft.  She could not see through the door\r\ndirectly, but a faint light came through the doorway as Karen opened\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nThe girl stood there, looking out.  Then suddenly she threw up her\r\nhands and screamed, and the next moment there was a blow struck. She\r\nstaggered back a step or two, and fell into the room.  The stewardess\r\nsaw a white figure in the doorway as the girl fell. Almost instantly\r\nsomething whizzed by her, striking the end of a pillow and bruising her\r\narm.  She must have fainted.  When she recovered, faint daylight was\r\ncoming into the room, and the body of the Danish girl was lying as it\r\nhad fallen.\r\n\r\nShe tried to get up, and fainted again.\r\n\r\nThat was her story, and it did not tell us much that we needed to know.\r\nShe showed me her right arm, which was badly bruised and discolored at\r\nthe shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by a white figure?\"\r\n\r\n\"It looked white: it seemed to shine.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I went to call you, Mrs. Sloane, the door to your room was\r\nclosed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw it closed!\" she said positively.  \"I had forgotten that, but now\r\nI remember.  The axe fell beside me, and I tried to scream, but I could\r\nnot.  I saw the door closed, very slowly and without a sound.  Then I\r\nfainted.\"\r\n\r\nThe thing was quite possible.  Owing to the small size of the cabin,\r\nand to the fact that it must accommodate two bunks, the door opened out\r\ninto the chart-room.  Probably the woman had fainted before I broke the\r\nlock of my door and fell into the main cabin. But a white figure!\r\n\r\n\"Karen exclaimed,\" Miss Lee said slowly, \"that some one was sitting on\r\nthe companion steps?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, miss.\"\r\n\r\n\"And she thought that it was Mr. Turner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" The stewardess looked quickly at Mrs. Turner, and averted her\r\neyes.  \"It may have been all talk, miss, about his--about his bothering\r\nher.  She was a great one to fancy that men were following her about.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Lee got up and came to the door where I was standing.\r\n\r\n\"Surely we need not be prisoners any longer!\" she said in an undertone.\r\n\"It is daylight.  If I stay here I shall go crazy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The murderer is still on the ship,\" I protested.  \"And just now the\r\ndeck is--hardly a place for women.  Wait until this afternoon, Miss\r\nLee.  By that time I shall have arranged for a guard for you. Although\r\nGod knows, with every man under suspicion, where we will find any to\r\ntrust.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will arrange a guard!\"\r\n\r\n\"The men have asked me to take charge.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--I don't understand.  The first mate--\"\r\n\r\n\"--is a prisoner of the crew.\"\r\n\r\n\"They accuse him!\"\r\n\r\n\"They have to accuse some one.  There's a sort of hysteria among the\r\nmen, and they've fixed on Singleton.  They won't hurt him, I'll see to\r\nthat,--and it makes for order.\"\r\n\r\nShe considered for a moment.  I had time then to see the havoc the\r\nnight had wrought in her.  She was pale, with deep hollows around her\r\neyes.  Her hands shook and her mouth drooped wearily.  But, although\r\nher face was lined with grief, it was not the passionate sorrow of a\r\nloving girl.  She had not loved Vail, I said to myself. She had not\r\nloved Vail!  My heart beat faster.\r\n\r\n\"Will you allow me to leave this room for five minutes?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I may go with you, and if you will come back without protest.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are arbitrary!\" she said resentfully.  \"I only wish to speak to\r\nMr. Turner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then--if I may wait at the door.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not go, under those conditions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Lee,\" I said desperately, \"surely you must realize the state of\r\naffairs.  We must trust no one--no one.  Every shadowy corner, every\r\nclosed door, may hold death in its most terrible form.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, of course.  Will you wait outside?  I can dress and be\r\nready in five minutes.\"\r\n\r\nI went into the main cabin, now bright with the morning sun, which\r\nstreamed down the forward companionway.  The door to Vail's room across\r\nwas open, and Williams, working in nervous haste, was putting it in\r\norder.  Walking up and down, his shrewd eyes keenly alert, Charlie\r\nJones was on guard, revolver in hand.  He came over to me at once.\r\n\r\n\"Turner is moving, in there,\" he said, jerking his thumb toward the\r\nforward cabin.  \"What are you going to do?  Let a drunken sot like that\r\ngive us orders, and bang us with a belaying pin when we don't please\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is the owner.  But one thing we can do, Jones.  We can keep him\r\nfrom more liquor.  Williams!\"\r\n\r\nHe came out, more dead than alive.\r\n\r\n\"Williams,\" I said sternly, \"I give you an hour to get rid of every\r\nounce of liquor on the Ella.  Remember, not a bottle is to be saved.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Mistah Turner--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll answer to Mr. Turner.  Get it overboard before he gets around.\r\nAnd, Williams!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"--sullenly.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going around after you, and if I find so much as a pint, I'll put\r\nyou in that room you have just left, and lock you in.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned even grayer, and went into the storeroom.\r\n\r\nA day later, and the crew would probably have resented what they saw\r\nthat morning.  But that day they only looked up apathetically from\r\ntheir gruesome work of sewing into bags of canvas the sheeted bodies on\r\nthe deck, while a gray-faced Negro in a white coat flung over the rail\r\ncases of fine wines, baskets and boxes full of bottles, dozen after\r\ndozen of brandies and liquors, all sinking beyond salvage in the blue\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\nMY first thought had been for the women, and, unluckily, to save them a\r\nshock I had all evidences of the crime cleared away as quickly as\r\npossible.  Stains that might have been of invaluable service in\r\ndetermining the murderer were washed away almost before they were dry.\r\nI realized this now, too late.  But the axe remained, and I felt that\r\nits handle probably contained a record for more skillful eyes than mine\r\nto read, prints that under the microscope would reveal the murderer's\r\nidentity as clearly as a photograph.\r\n\r\nI sent for Burns, who reported that he had locked the axe in the\r\ncaptain's cabin.  He gave me the key, which I fastened to a string and\r\nhung around my neck under my shirt.  He also reported that, as I had\r\nsuggested, the crew had gone, two at a time, into the forecastle, and\r\nhad brought up what they needed to stay on deck. The forecastle had\r\nbeen closed and locked in the presence of the crew, and the key given\r\nto Burns, who fastened it to his watch-chain. The two hatchways leading\r\nto the hold had been fastened down also, and Oleson, who was ship's\r\ncarpenter, had nailed them fast.\r\n\r\nThe crew had been instructed to stay aft of the wheel, except when on\r\nwatch.  Thus the helmsman need not be alone.  As I have said, the door\r\nat the top of the companion steps, near the wheel, was closed and\r\nlocked, and entrance to the after house was to be gained only by the\r\nforward companion.  It was the intention of Burns and myself to keep\r\nwatch here, amidships.\r\n\r\nBurns had probably suffered more than any of us.  Whatever his relation\r\nto the Hansen woman had been, he had been with her only three hours\r\nbefore her death, and she was wearing a ring of his, a silver rope tied\r\nin a sailor's knot, when she died.  And Burns had been fond of Captain\r\nRichardson, in a crew where respect rather than affection toward the\r\nchief officer was the rule.\r\n\r\nWhen Burns gave me the key to the captain's room Charlie Jones had\r\nreached the other end of the long cabin, and was staring through into\r\nthe chartroom.  It was a time to trust no one, and I assured myself\r\nthat Jones was not looking before I thrust it into my shirt.\r\n\r\n\"They're--all ready, Leslie,\" Burns said, his face working.  \"What are\r\nwe going to do with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to take them back.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we can't do that.  It's a two weeks' matter, and in this weather--\"\r\n\r\n\"We will take them back, Burns,\" I said shortly, and he assented\r\nmechanically:--\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye, sir.\"\r\n\r\nJust how it was to be done was a difficult thing to decide.  Miss Lee\r\nhad not appeared yet, and the three of us, Jones, Burns, and I, talked\r\nit over.  Jones suggested that we put them in one of the life boats,\r\nand nail over it a canvas and tarpaulin cover.\r\n\r\n\"It ain't my own idea,\" he said modestly.  \"I seen it done once, on the\r\nArgentina.  It worked all right for a while, and after a week or so we\r\nlowered the jolly-boat and towed it astern.\"\r\n\r\nI shuddered; but the idea was a good one, and I asked Burns to go up\r\nand get the boat ready.\r\n\r\n\"We must let the women up this afternoon,\" I said, \"and, if it is\r\npossible, try to keep them from learning where the bodies are.  We can\r\nrope off a part of the deck for them, and ask them not to leave it.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Lee came out then, and Burns went on deck.\r\n\r\nThe girl was looking better.  The exertion of dressing had brought back\r\nher color, and her lips, although firmly set, were not drawn. She stood\r\njust outside the door and drew a deep breath.\r\n\r\n\"You must not keep us prisoners any longer, Leslie,\" she said. \"Put a\r\nguard over us, if you must, but let us up in the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"This afternoon, Miss Lee,\" I said.  \"This morning you are better\r\nbelow.\"\r\n\r\nShe understood me, but she had no conception of the brutality of the\r\ncrime, even then.\r\n\r\n\"I am not a child.  I wish to see them.  I shall have to testify--\"\r\n\r\n\"You will not see them, Miss Lee.\"\r\n\r\nShe stood twisting her handkerchief in her hands.  She saw Charlie\r\nJones pacing the length of the cabin, revolver in hand.  From the\r\nchartroom came the sound of hammering, where the after companion door,\r\nalready locked, was being additionally secured with strips of wood\r\nnailed across.\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" she said finally.  \"Will you take me to Karen's room?\"\r\n\r\nI could see no reason for objecting; but so thorough was the panic that\r\nhad infected us all that I would not allow her in until I had preceded\r\nher, and had searched in the clothes closet and under the two bunks.\r\nWilliams had not reached this room yet, and there was a pool of blood\r\non the floor.\r\n\r\nShe had a great deal of courage.  She glanced at the stain, and looked\r\naway again quickly.\r\n\r\n\"I--think I shall not come in.  Will you look at the bell register for\r\nme?  What bell is registered?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three!\" she said.  \"Are you sure?\"\r\n\r\nI looked again.  \"It is three.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it was not my sister's bell that rang.  It was Mr. Vail's!\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be a mistake.  Perhaps the wires--\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Turner's room is number one.  Please go back and ask her to ring\r\nher bell, while I see how it registers.\"\r\n\r\nBut I would not leave her there alone.  I went with her to her sister's\r\ndoor, and together we returned to the maids' cabin.  Mrs. Turner had\r\nrung as we requested, and her bell had registered \"One.\"\r\n\r\n\"He rang for help!\" she cried, and broke down utterly.  She dropped\r\ninto a chair in the chart-room and cried softly, helplessly, while I\r\nstood by, unable to think of anything to do or say.  I think now that\r\nit was the best thing she could have done, though at the time I was\r\nalarmed.  I ventured, finally, to put my hand on her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Please!\" I said.\r\n\r\nCharlie Jones came to the door of the chartroom, and retreated with\r\ninstinctive good taste.  She stopped crying after a time, and I knew\r\nthe exact instant when she realized my touch.  I felt her stiffen;\r\nwithout looking up, she drew away from my hand; and I stepped back,\r\nhurt and angry--the hurt for her, the anger that I could not remember\r\nthat I was her hired servant.\r\n\r\nWhen she got up, she did not look at me, nor I at her--at least not\r\nconsciously.  But when, in those days, was I not looking at her, seeing\r\nher, even when my eyes were averted, feeling her presence before any\r\nordinary sense told me she was near?  The sound of her voice in the\r\nearly mornings, when I was washing down the deck, had been enough to\r\nset my blood pounding in my ears.  The last thing I saw at night, when\r\nI took myself to the storeroom to sleep, was her door across the main\r\ncabin; and in the morning, stumbling out with my pillow and blanket, I\r\ngave it a foolish little sign of greeting.\r\n\r\nWhat she would not see the men had seen, and, in their need, they had\r\nmade me their leader.  To her I was Leslie, the common sailor. I\r\nregistered a vow, that morning, that I would be the common sailor until\r\nthe end of the voyage.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Turner is awake, I believe,\" I said stiffly.\r\n\r\n\"Very well.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned back into the main cabin; but she paused at the storeroom\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\"It is curious that you heard nothing,\" she said slowly.  \"You slept\r\nwith this door open, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was locked in.\"\r\n\r\nShe stooped quickly and looked at the lock.\r\n\r\n\"You broke it open?\"\r\n\r\n\"Partly, at the last.  I heard--\"  I stopped.  I did not want to tell\r\nher what I had heard.  But she knew.\r\n\r\n\"You heard--Karen, when she screamed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  I was aroused before that,--I do not know how,--and found I was\r\nlocked in.  I thought it might be a joke--forecastle hands are fond of\r\njoking, and they resented my being brought here to sleep. I took out\r\nsome of the screws with my knife, and--then I broke the door.\"\r\n\r\n\"You saw no one?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was dark; I saw and heard no one.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, surely--the man at the wheel--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush,\" I warned her; \"he is there.  He heard something, but the\r\nhelmsman cannot leave the wheel.\"\r\n\r\nShe was stooping to the lock again.\r\n\r\n\"You are sure it was locked?\"\r\n\r\n\"The bolt is still shot.\"  I showed her.\r\n\r\n\"Then--where is the key?\"\r\n\r\n\"The key!\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.  Find the key, and you will find the man who locked you in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless,\" I reminded her, \"it flew out when I broke the lock.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case, it will be on the floor.\"\r\n\r\nBut an exhaustive search of the cabin floor discovered no key. Jones,\r\nseeing us searching, helped, his revolver in one hand and a lighted\r\nmatch in the other, handling both with an abandon of ease that\r\nthreatened us alternately with fire and a bullet.  But there was no key.\r\n\r\n\"It stands to reason, miss,\" he said, when we had given up, \"that,\r\nsince the key isn't here, it isn't on the ship.  That there key is a\r\nsort of red-hot give-away.  No one is going to carry a thing like that\r\naround.  Either it's here in this cabin--which it isn't--or it's\r\noverboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely, Jones.  But I shall ask Mr. Turner to search the men.\"\r\n\r\nShe went toward Turner's door, and Jones leaned over me, putting a hand\r\non my arm.\r\n\r\n\"She's right, boy,\" he said quickly.  \"Don't let 'em know what you're\r\nafter, but go through their pockets.  And their shoes!\" he called after\r\nme.  \"A key slips into a shoe mighty easy.\"\r\n\r\nBut, after all, it was not necessary.  The key was to be found, and\r\nvery soon.\r\n\nExactly what occurred during Elsa Lee's visit to her brother-in-law's\r\ncabin I have never learned.  He was sober, I know, and somewhat dazed,\r\nwith no recollection whatever of the previous night, except a hazy idea\r\nthat he had quarreled with Richardson.\r\n\r\nJones and I waited outside.  He suggested that we have prayers over the\r\nbodies when we placed them in the boat, and I agreed to read the burial\r\nservice from the Episcopal Prayer Book.  The voices from Turner's cabin\r\ncame steadily, Miss Lee's low tones, Turner's heavy bass only now and\r\nthen.  Once I heard her give a startled exclamation, and both Jones and\r\nI leaped to the door.  But the next moment she was talking again\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\nTen minutes--fifteen--passed.  I grew restless and took to wandering\r\nabout the cabin.  Mrs. Johns came to the door opposite, and asked to\r\nhave tea sent down to the stewardess.  I called the request up the\r\ncompanionway, unwilling to leave the cabin for a moment.  When I came\r\nback, Jones was standing at the door of Vail's cabin, looking in.  His\r\nface was pale.\r\n\r\n\"Look there!\" he said hoarsely.  \"Look at the bell.  He must have tried\r\nto push the button!\"\r\n\r\nI stared in.  Williams had put the cabin to rights, as nearly as he\r\ncould.  The soaked mattress was gone, and a clean linen sheet was\r\nspread over the bunk.  Poor Vail's clothing, as he had taken it off the\r\nnight before, hung on a mahogany stand beside the bed, and above,\r\nalmost concealed by his coat, was the bell.  Jones's eyes were fixed on\r\nthe darkish smear, over and around the bell, on the white paint.\r\n\r\nI measured the height of the bell from the bed.  It was well above, and\r\nto one side--a smear rather than a print, too indeterminate to be of\r\nany value, sinister, cruel.\r\n\r\n\"He didn't do that, Charlie,\" I said.  \"He couldn't have got up to it\r\nafter--That is the murderer's mark.  He leaned there, one hand against\r\nthe wall, to look down at his work. And, without knowing it, he pressed\r\nthe button that roused the two women.\"\r\n\r\nHe had not heard the story of Henrietta Sloane, and, as we waited, I\r\ntold him.  Some of the tension was relaxing.  He tried, in his\r\nargumentative German way, to drag me into a discussion as to the\r\nforeordination of a death that resulted from an accidental ringing of a\r\nbell.  But my ears were alert for the voices near by, and soon Miss Lee\r\nopened the door.\r\n\r\nTurner was sitting on his bunk.  He had made an attempt to shave, and\r\nhad cut his chin severely.  He was in a dressing-gown, and was holding\r\na handkerchief to his face; he peered at me over it with red-rimmed\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"This--this is horrible, Leslie,\" he said.  \"I can hardly believe it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true, Mr. Turner.\"\r\n\r\nHe took the handkerchief away and looked to see if the bleeding had\r\nstopped.  I believe he intended to impress us both with his coolness,\r\nbut it was an unfortunate attempt.  His lips, relieved of the pressure,\r\nwere twitching; his nerveless fingers could hardly refold the\r\nhandkerchief.\r\n\r\n\"Wh-why was I not--called at once?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"I notified you.  You were--you must have gone to sleep again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe you called me.  You're--lying, aren't you?\"  He got\r\nup, steadying himself by the wall, and swaying dizzily to the motion of\r\nthe ship.  \"You shut me off down here, and then run things your own\r\ndamned way.\"  He turned on Miss Lee.  \"Where's Helen?\"\r\n\r\n\"In her room, Marsh.  She has one of her headaches.  Please don't\r\ndisturb her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where's Williams?\" He turned to me.\r\n\r\n\"I can get him for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell him to bring me a highball.  My mouth's sticky.\"  He ran his\r\ntongue over his dry lips.  \"And--take a message from me to\r\nRichardson--\"  He stopped, startled.  Indeed, Miss Lee and I had both\r\nstarted.  \"To who's running the boat, anyhow?  Singleton?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Singleton is a prisoner in the forward house,\" I said gravely.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this was astonishing.  He stared at us both, and, finding\r\ncorroboration in Miss Lee's face, his own took on an instant expression\r\nof relief.  He dropped to the side of the bed, and his color came\r\nslowly back.  He even smiled--a crafty grin that was inexpressibly\r\nhorrible.\r\n\r\n\"Singleton!\" he said.  \"Why do they--how do they know it was he?\"\r\n\r\n\"He had quarreled with the captain last night, and he was on duty at\r\nthe time of the when the thing happened.  The man at the wheel claims\r\nto have seen him in the chartroom just before, and there was other\r\nevidence, I believe.  The lookout saw him forward, with\r\nsomething--possibly the axe.  Not decisive, of course, but enough to\r\njustify putting him in irons.  Somebody did it, and the murderer is on\r\nboard, Mr. Turner.\"\r\n\r\nHis grin had faded, but the crafty look in his pale-blue eyes remained.\r\n\r\n\"The chart-room was dark.  How could the steersman--\"  He checked\r\nhimself abruptly, and looked at us both quickly.  \"Where are--they?\" he\r\nasked in a different tone.\r\n\r\n\"On deck.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't keep them in this weather.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must,\" I said.  \"We will have to get to the nearest port as quickly\r\nas we can, and surrender ourselves and the bodies.  This thing will\r\nhave to be sifted to the bottom, Mr. Turner.  The innocent must not\r\nsuffer for the guilty, and every one on the ship is under suspicion.\"\r\n\r\nHe fell into a passion at that, insisting that the bodies be buried at\r\nonce, asserting his ownership of the vessel as his authority, demanding\r\nto know what I, a forecastle hand, had to say about it, flinging up and\r\ndown the small room, showering me with invective and threats, and\r\nshoving Miss Lee aside when she laid a calming hand on his arm.  The\r\ncut on his chin was bleeding again, adding to his wild and sinister\r\nexpression.  He ended by demanding Williams.\r\n\r\nI opened the door and called to Charlie Jones to send the butler, and\r\nstood by, waiting for the fresh explosion that was coming. Williams\r\nshakily confessed that there was no whiskey on board.\r\n\r\n\"Where is it?\" Turner thundered.\r\n\r\nWilliams looked at me.  He was in a state of inarticulate fright.\r\n\r\n\"I ordered it overboard,\" I said.\r\n\r\nTurner whirled on me, incredulity and rage in his face.\r\n\r\n\"You!\"\r\n\r\nI put the best face I could on the matter, and eyed him steadily.\r\n\"There has been too much drinking on this ship,\" I said.  \"If you doubt\r\nit, go up and look at the three bodies on the deck.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you to do about it?\"  His eyes were narrowed; there was\r\nmenace in every line of his face.\r\n\r\n\"With Schwartz gone, Captain Richardson dead, and Singleton in irons,\r\nthe crew had no officers.  They asked me to take charge.\"\r\n\r\n\"So!  And you used your authority to meddle with what does not concern\r\nyou  The ship has an officer while I am on it.  And there will be no\r\nmutiny.\"\r\n\r\nHe flung into the main cabin, and made for the forward companionway. I\r\nstepped back to allow Miss Lee to precede me.  She was standing, her\r\nback to the dressing-stand, facing the door.  She looked at me and made\r\na helpless gesture with her hands, as if the situation were beyond her.\r\nThen I saw her look down.  She took a quick step or two toward the\r\ndoor, and, stooping picked up some small object from almost under my\r\nfoot.  The incident would have passed without notice, had she not, in\r\nattempting to wrap it in her handkerchief, dropped it.  I saw then that\r\nit was a key.\r\n\r\n\"Let me get it for you,\" I said.  To my amazement, she put her foot\r\nover it.\r\n\r\n\"Please see what Mr. Turner is doing,\" she said.  \"It is the key to my\r\njewel-case.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you let me see it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not the key to a jewel-case.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does not concern you what it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the key to the storeroom door.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are stronger than I am.  You look the brute.  You can knock me\r\naway and get it.\"\r\n\r\nI knew then, of course, that it was the storeroom key.  But I could not\r\ntake it by force.  And so defiantly she faced me, so valiant was every\r\nline of her slight figure, that I was ashamed of my impulse to push her\r\naside and take it.  I loved her with every inch of my overgrown body,\r\nand I did the thing she knew I would do.  I bowed and left the cabin.\r\nBut I had no intention of losing the key.  I could not take it by\r\nforce, but she knew as well as I did what finding it there in Turner's\r\nroom meant.  Turner had locked me in. But I must be able to prove\r\nit--my wits against hers, and the advantage mine.  I had the women\r\nunder guard.\r\n\r\nI went up on deck.\r\n\r\nA curious spectacle revealed itself.  Turner, purple with anger, was\r\nharanguing the men, who stood amidships, huddled together, but grim and\r\ndetermined withal.  Burns, a little apart from the rest, was standing,\r\nsullen, his arms folded.  As Turner ceased, he took a step forward.\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Mr. Turner,\" he said.  \"It's your ship, and it's up to\r\nyou to say where she goes and how she goes, sir.  But some one will\r\nhang for this, Mr. Turner,--some one that's on this deck now; and the\r\nbodies are going back with us--likewise the axe.  There ain't going to\r\nbe a mistake--the right man is going to swing.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's mutiny!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" Burns acknowledged, his face paling a little.  \"I guess you\r\ncould call it that.\"\r\n\r\nTurner swung on his heel and went below, where Jones, relieved of guard\r\nduty by Burns, reported him locked in his room, refusing admission to\r\nhis wife and Miss Lee, both of whom had knocked on the door.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with Turner added to the general misery of the situation.\r\nBurns got our position at noon with more or less exactness, and the\r\ngeneral working of the Ella went on well enough.  But the situation was\r\nindescribable.  Men started if a penknife dropped, and swore if a sail\r\nflapped.  The call of the boatswain's pipe rasped their ears, and the\r\npreparation for stowing the bodies in the jolly-boat left them unnerved\r\nand sick.  Some sort of a meal was cooked, but no one could eat;\r\nWilliams brought up, untasted, the luncheon he had carried down to the\r\nafter house.\r\n\r\nAt two o'clock all hands gathered amidships, and the bodies were\r\ncarried forward to where the boat, lowered in its davits and braced,\r\nlay on the deck.  It had been lined with canvas and tarpaulin, and a\r\ncover of similar material lay ready to be nailed in place.  All the men\r\nwere bareheaded.  Many were in tears.  Miss Lee came forward with us,\r\nand it was from her prayer-book that I, too moved for\r\nself-consciousness, read the burial-service.\r\n\r\n\"I am the resurrection and the life,\" I read huskily.\r\n\r\nThe figures at my feet, in their canvas shrouds, rolled gently with the\r\nrocking of the ship; the sun beat down on the decks, on the bare heads\r\nof the men, on the gilt edges of the prayer-book, gleaming in the\r\nlight, on the last of the land-birds, drooping in the heat on the main\r\ncross-trees.\r\n\r\n\"... For man walketh in a vain shadow,\" I read, \"and disquieteth\r\nhimself in vain....\r\n\r\n\"O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength: before I go\r\nhence, and be no more seen.\"\r\n\nMrs. Johns and the stewardess came up late in the afternoon.  We had\r\nrailed off a part of the deck around the forward companionway for them,\r\nand none of the crew except the man on guard was allowed inside the\r\nropes.  After a consultation, finding the ship very short-handed, and\r\nunwilling with the night coming on to trust any of the men, Burns and I\r\ndecided to take over this duty ourselves, and, by stationing ourselves\r\nat the top of the companionway, to combine the duties of officer on\r\nwatch and guard of the after house.  To make the women doubly secure,\r\nwe had Oleson nail all the windows closed, although they were merely\r\nportholes.  Jones was no longer on guard below, and I had exchanged\r\nSingleton's worthless revolver for my own serviceable one.\r\n\r\nMrs. Johns, carefully dressed, surveyed the railed-off deck with raised\r\neyebrows.\r\n\r\n\"For--us?\" she asked, looking at me.  The men were gathered about the\r\nwheel aft, and were out of ear-shot.  Mrs. Sloane had dropped into a\r\nsteamer-chair, and was lying back with closed eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mrs. Johns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where have you put them?\"\r\n\r\nI pointed to where the jolly-boat, on the port side of the ship, swung\r\non its davits.\r\n\r\n\"And the mate, Mr. Singleton?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is in the forward house.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do with the--the weapon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you ask that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Morbid curiosity,\" she said, with a lightness of tone that rang false\r\nto my ears.  \"And then--naturally, I should like to be sure that it is\r\nsafely overboard, so it will not be\"--she shivered--\"used again.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not overboard, Mrs. Johns,\" I said gravely.  \"It is locked in a\r\nsafe place, where it will remain until the police come to take it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are rather theatrical, aren't you?\" she scoffed, and turned away.\r\nBut a second later she came back to me, and put her hand on my arm.\r\n\"Tell me where it is,\" she begged.  \"You are making a mystery of it,\r\nand I detest mysteries.\"\r\n\r\nI saw under her mask of lightness then: she wanted desperately to know\r\nwhere the axe was.  Her eyes fell, under my gaze.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry.  There is no mystery.  It is simply locked away for\r\nsafe-keeping.\"\r\n\r\nShe bit her lip.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what I think?\" she said slowly.  \"I think you have\r\nhypnotized the crew, as you did me--at first.  Why has no one\r\nremembered that you were in the after house last night, that you found\r\npoor Wilmer Vail, that you raised the alarm, that you discovered the\r\ncaptain and Karen?  Why should I not call the men here and remind them\r\nof all that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not believe you will.  They know I was locked in the storeroom.\r\nThe door--the lock--\"\r\n\r\n\"You could have locked yourself in.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not know what you are saying!\"\r\n\r\nBut I had angered her, and she went on cruelly:--\r\n\r\n\"Who are you, anyhow?  You are not a sailor.  You came here and were\r\ntaken on because you told a hard-luck story.  How do we know that you\r\ncame from a hospital?  Men just out of prison look as you did. Do you\r\nknow what we called you, the first two days out?  We called you Elsa's\r\njail-bird  And now, because you have dominated the crew, we are in your\r\nhands!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do Mrs. Turner and Miss Lee think that?\"\r\n\r\n\"They feel as I do.  This is a picked crew men the Turner line has\r\nemployed for years.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very brave, Mrs. Johns,\" I said.  \"If I were what you think I\r\nam, I would be a dangerous enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not afraid of you.\"\r\n\r\nI thought fast.  She was right.  It had not occurred to me before, but\r\nit swept over me overwhelmingly.\r\n\r\n\"You are leaving me only one thing to do,\" I said.  \"I shall surrender\r\nmyself to the men at once.\"  I took out my revolver and held it out to\r\nher.  \"This rope is a dead-line.  The crew know, and you will have no\r\ntrouble; but you must stand guard here until some one else is sent.\"\r\n\r\nShe took the revolver without a word, and, somewhat dazed by this new\r\nturn of events, I went aft.  The men were gathered there, and I\r\nsurrendered myself.  They listened in silence while I told them the\r\nsituation.  Burns, who had been trying to sleep, sat up and stared at\r\nme incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"It will leave you pretty short-handed, boys,\" I finished, \"but you'd\r\nbetter fasten me up somewhere.  But I want to be sure of one thing\r\nfirst: whatever happens, keep the guard for the women.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd like to talk it over, Leslie,\" Burns said, after a word with the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nI went forward a few feet, taking care to remain where they could see\r\nme, and very soon they called me.  There had been a dispute, I believe.\r\nAdams and McNamara stood off from the others, their faces not\r\nunfriendly, but clearly differing from the decision.  Charlie Jones,\r\nwho, by reason of long service and a sort of pious control he had in\r\nthe forecastle, was generally spokesman for the crew, took a step or\r\ntwo toward me.\r\n\r\n\"We'll not do it, boy,\" he said.  \"We think we know a man when we see\r\none, as well as having occasion to know that you're white all through.\r\nAnd we're not inclined to set the talk of women against what we think\r\nbest to do.  So you stick to your job, and we're back of you.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, I choked up.  I tried to tell them what their\r\nloyalty meant to me; but I could only hold out my hand, and, one by\r\none, they came up and shook it solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"We think,\" McNamara said, when, last of all, he and Adams came up,\r\n\"that it would be best, lad, if we put down in the log-book all that\r\nhas happened last night and to-day, and this just now, too.  It's fresh\r\nin our minds now, and it will be something to go by.\"\r\n\r\nSo Burns and I got the log-book from the captain's cabin.  The axe was\r\nthere, where we had placed it earlier in the day, lying on the white\r\ncover of the bed.  The room was untouched, as the dead man had left\r\nit--a collar on the stand, brushes put down hastily, a half-smoked\r\ncigar which had burned a long scar on the wood before it had gone out.\r\nWe went out silently, Burns carrying the book, I locking the door\r\nbehind us.\r\n\r\nMrs. Johns, sitting near the companionway with the revolver on her\r\nknee, looked up and eyed me coolly.\r\n\r\n\"So they would not do it!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to disappoint you--they would not.\"\r\n\r\nShe held up my revolver to me, and smiled cynically.\r\n\r\n\"Remember,\" she said, \"I only said you were a possibility.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you; I shall remember.\"\r\n\r\nBy unanimous consent, the task of putting down what had happened was\r\ngiven to me.  I have a copy of the log-book before me now, the one that\r\nwas used at the trial.  The men read it through before they signed it.\r\n\r\n                                                   August thirteenth.\r\n\r\nThis morning, between two-thirty and three o'clock, three murders were\r\ncommitted on the yacht Ella.  At the request of Mrs. Johns, one of the\r\nparty on board, I had moved to the after house to sleep, putting my\r\nblanket and pillow in the storeroom and sleeping on the floor there.\r\nMrs. Johns gave, as her reason, a fear of something going wrong, as\r\nthere was trouble between Mr. Turner and the captain. I slept with a\r\nrevolver beside me and with the door of the storeroom open.\r\n\r\nAt some time shortly before three o'clock I wakened with a feeling of\r\nsuffocation, and found that the door was closed and locked on the\r\noutside.  I suspected a joke among the crew, and set to work with my\r\npen-knife to unscrew the lock.  When I had two screws out, a woman\r\nscreamed, and I broke down the door.\r\n\r\nAs the main cabin was dark, I saw no one and could not tell where the\r\ncry came from.  I ran into Mr. Vail's cabin, next the storeroom, and\r\ncalled him.  His door was standing open.  I heard him breathing\r\nheavily.  Then the breathing stopped.  I struck a match, and found him\r\ndead.  His head had been crushed in with an axe, the left hand cut off,\r\nand there were gashes on the right shoulder and the abdomen.\r\n\r\nI knew the helmsman would be at the wheel, and ran up the after\r\ncompanionway to him and told him.  Then I ran forward and called the\r\nfirst mate, Mr. Singleton, who was on duty.  He had been drinking. I\r\nasked him to call the captain, but he did not.  He got his revolver,\r\nand we hurried down the forward companion.  The body of the captain was\r\nlying at the foot of the steps, his head on the lowest stair.  He had\r\nbeen killed like Mr. Vail.  His cap had been placed over his face.\r\n\r\nThe mate collapsed on the steps.  I found the light switch and turned\r\nit on.  There was no one in the cabin or in the chart-room.  I ran to\r\nMr. Turner's room, going through Mr. Vail's and through the bathroom.\r\nMr. Turner was in bed, fully dressed.  I could not rouse him.  Like the\r\nmate, he had been drinking.\r\n\r\nThe mate had roused the crew, and they gathered in the chart-room. I\r\ntold them what had happened, and that the murderer must be among us.  I\r\nsuggested that they stay together, and that they submit to being\r\nsearched for weapons.\r\n\r\nThey went on deck in a body, and I roused the women and told them. Mrs.\r\nTurner asked me to tell the two maids, who slept in a cabin off the\r\nchartroom.  I found their door unlocked, and, receiving no answer,\r\nopened it.  Karen Hansen, the lady's-maid, was on the floor, dead, with\r\nher skull crushed in.  The stewardess, Henrietta Sloane, was fainting\r\nin her bunk.  An axe had been hurled through the doorway as the Hansen\r\nwoman fell, and was found in the stewardess's bunk.\r\n\r\nDawn coming by that time, I suggested a guard at the two companionways,\r\nand this was done.  The men were searched and all weapons taken from\r\nthem.  Mr. Singleton was under suspicion, it being known that he had\r\nthreatened the captain's life, and Oleson, a lookout, claiming to have\r\nseen him forward where the axe was kept.\r\n\r\nThe crew insisted that Singleton be put in irons.  He made no\r\nobjection, and we locked him in his own room in the forward house.\r\nOwing to the loss of Schwartz, the second mate, already recorded in\r\nthis log-book (see entry for August ninth), the death of the captain,\r\nand the imprisonment of the first mate, the ship was left without\r\nofficers.  Until Mr. Turner could make an arrangement, the crew\r\nnominated Burns, one of themselves, as mate, and asked me to assume\r\ncommand.  I protested that I knew nothing of navigation, but agreed on\r\nits being represented that, as I was not one of them, there could be\r\nill feeling.\r\n\r\nThe ship was searched, on the possibility of finding a stowaway in the\r\nhold.  But nothing was found.  I divided the men into two watches,\r\nBurns taking one and I the other.  We nailed up the after companionway,\r\nand forbade any member of the crew to enter the after house.  The\r\nforecastle was also locked, the men bringing their belongings on deck.\r\nThe stewardess recovered and told her story, which, in her own writing,\r\nwill be added to this record.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of the dead were brought on deck and sewed into canvas, and\r\nlater, with appropriate services, placed in the jolly-boat, it being\r\nthe intention, later on, to tow the boat behind us.  Mr. Turner\r\ninsisted that the bodies be buried at sea, and, on the crew opposing\r\nthis, retired to his cabin, announcing that he considered the position\r\nof the men a mutiny.\r\n\r\nSome feeling having arisen among the women of the party that I might\r\nknow more of the crimes than was generally supposed, having been in the\r\nafter house at the time they were committed, and having no references,\r\nI this afternoon voluntarily surrendered myself to Burns, acting first\r\nmate.  The men, however, refused to accept this surrender, only two,\r\nAdams and McNamara, favoring it.  I expect to give myself up to the\r\npolice at the nearest port, until the matter is thoroughly probed.\r\n\r\nThe axe is locked in the captain's cabin.\r\n\r\n                 (Signed) RALPH LESLIE.\r\n                          John Robert Burns\r\n                          Charles Klineordlinger (Jones)\r\n                          William McNamara\r\n            Witnesses     Carl L. Clarke\r\n                          Joseph Q. Adams\r\n                          John Oleson\r\n                          Tom MacKenzie\r\n                          Obadiah Williams\r\n\nWilliams came up on deck late that afternoon, with a scared face, and\r\nannounced that Mr. Turner had locked himself in his cabin, and was\r\nraving in delirium on the other side of the door.  I sent Burns down\r\nhaving decided, in view of Mrs. Johns's accusation, to keep away from\r\nthe living quarters of the family.  Burns's report corroborated what\r\nWilliams had said.  Turner was in the grip of delirium tremens, and the\r\nElla was without owner or officers.\r\n\r\nTurner refused to open either door for us.  As well as we could make\r\nout, he was moving rapidly but almost noiselessly up and down the room,\r\nmuttering to himself, now and then throwing himself on the bed, only to\r\nget up at once.  He rang his bell a dozen times, and summoned Williams,\r\nonly, in reply to the butler's palpitating knock, to stand beyond the\r\ndoor and refuse to open it or to voice any request.  The situation\r\nbecame so urgent that finally I was forced to go down, with no better\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nMrs. Turner dragged herself across, on the state of affairs being\r\nreported to her, and, after two or three abortive attempts, succeeded\r\nin getting a reply from him.\r\n\r\n\"Marsh!\" she called.  \"I want to talk to you.  Let me in.\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll get us,\" he said craftily.\r\n\r\n\"Us?  Who is with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vail,\" he replied promptly.  \"He's here talking.  He won't let me\r\nsleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell him to give you the key and you will keep it for him so no one\r\ncan get him,\" I prompted.  I had had some experience with such cases in\r\nthe hospital.\r\n\r\nShe tried it without any particular hope, but it succeeded immediately.\r\nHe pushed the key out under the door, and almost at once we heard him\r\nthrow himself on the bed, as if satisfied that the problem of his\r\nsecurity was solved.\r\n\r\nMrs. Turner held the key out to me, but I would not take it.\r\n\r\n\"Give it to Williams,\" I said.  \"You must understand, Mrs. Turner, that\r\nI cannot take it.\"\r\n\r\nShe was a woman of few words, and after a glance at my determined face\r\nshe turned to the butler.\r\n\r\n\"You will have to look after Mr. Turner, Williams.  See that he is\r\ncomfortable, and try to keep him in bed.\"\r\n\r\nWilliams put out a trembling hand, but, before he took the key,\r\nTurner's voice rose petulantly on the other side of the door.\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, Wilmer,\" he cried plaintively, \"get out and let me\r\nsleep  I haven't slept for a month.\"\r\n\r\nWilliams gave a whoop of fear, and ran out of the cabin, crying that\r\nthe ship was haunted and that Vail had come back.  From that moment, I\r\nbelieve, the after house was the safest spot on the ship. To my\r\nknowledge, no member of the crew so much as passed it on the starboard\r\nside, where Vail's and Turner's cabins were situated.  It was the one\r\ngood turn the owner of the Ella did us on that hideous return journey;\r\nfor, during most of the sixteen days that it took us to get back, he\r\nlay in his cabin, alternating the wild frenzy of delirium tremens with\r\nquieter moments when he glared at us with crafty, murderous eyes, and\r\npicked incessantly at the bandages that tied him down.  Not an instant\r\ndid he sleep, that we could discover; and always, day or night, Vail\r\nwas with him, and they were quarreling. The four women took care of him\r\nas best they could.  For a time they gave him the bromides I prepared,\r\ntaking my medical knowledge without question.  In the horror of the\r\nsituation, curiosity had no place, and class distinctions were\r\nforgotten.  That great leveler, a common trouble, put Henrietta Sloane,\r\nthe stewardess, and the women of the party at the same table in the\r\nafter house, where none ate, and placed the responsibility for the\r\nship, although, I was nominally in command, on the shoulders of all the\r\nmen.  And there sprang up among them a sort of esprit de corps, curious\r\nunder the circumstances, and partly explained, perhaps, by the belief\r\nthat in imprisoning Singleton they had the murderer safely in hand.\r\nWhat they thought of Turner's possible connection with the crime, I do\r\nnot know.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I was convinced that Turner was guilty.  Perhaps, lulled\r\ninto a false security by the incarceration of the two men, we\r\nunconsciously relaxed our vigilance.  But by the first night the crew\r\nwere somewhat calmer.  Here and there a pipe was lighted, and a plug of\r\ntobacco went the rounds.  The forecastle supper, served on deck, was\r\neaten; and Charlie Jones, securing a permission that I thought it best\r\nto grant, went forward and painted a large black cross on the side of\r\nthe jolly-boat, and below it the date, August 13, 1911.  The crew\r\nwatched in respectful silence.\r\n\r\nThe weather was in our favor, the wind on our quarter, a blue sky\r\nheaped with white cloud masses, with the sunset fringed with the\r\ndeepest rose.  The Ella made no great way, but sailed easily.  Burns\r\nand I alternated at the forward companionway, and, although the men\r\nwere divided into watches, the entire crew was on duty virtually all\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nI find, on consulting the book in which I recorded, beginning with that\r\nday, the incidents of the return voyage, that two things happened that\r\nevening.  One was my interview with Singleton; the other was my curious\r\nand depressing clash with Elsa Lee, on the deck that night.\r\n\r\nTurner being quiet and Burns on watch at the beginning of the second\r\ndog watch, six o'clock, I went forward to the room where Singleton was\r\nimprisoned.  Burns gave me the key, and advised me to take a weapon.  I\r\ndid not, however, nor was it needed.\r\n\r\nThe first mate was sitting on the edge of his bunk, in his attitude of\r\nthe morning, his head in his hands.  As I entered, he looked up and\r\nnodded.  His color was still bad; he looked ill and nervous, as might\r\nhave been expected after his condition the night before.\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, Leslie,\" he said, \"tell them to open the window. I'm\r\nchoking!\"\r\n\r\nHe was right: the room was stifling.  I opened the door behind me, and\r\nstood in the doorway, against a rush for freedom.  But he did not move.\r\nHe sank back into his dejected attitude.\r\n\r\n\"Will you eat some soup, if I send it?\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything you care for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Better let me starve; I'm gone, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Singleton,\" I said, \"I wish you would tell me about last night. If you\r\ndid it, we've got you.  If you didn't, you'd better let me take your\r\nown account of what happened, while it's fresh in your mind.  Or,\r\nbetter still, write it yourself.\"\r\n\r\nHe held out his right hand.  I saw that it was shaking violently.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't hold a pen,\" he said tersely.  \"Wouldn't be believed, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nThe air being somewhat better, I closed and locked the door again, and,\r\ncoming in, took out my notebook and pencil.  He watched me craftily.\r\n\"You can write it,\" he said, \"if you'll give it to me to keep.  I'm not\r\ngoing to put the rope around my own neck.  If it's all right, my\r\nlawyers will use it.  If it isn't--\"  He shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\nI had never liked the man, and his tacit acknowledgment that he might\r\nincriminate himself made me eye him with shuddering distaste. But I\r\ntook down his story, and reproduce it here, minus the technicalities\r\nand profanity with which it was interlarded.\r\n\r\nBriefly, Singleton's watch began at midnight.  The captain, who had\r\nbeen complaining of lumbago, had had the cook prepare him a mustard\r\npoultice, and had retired early.  Burns was on watch from eight to\r\ntwelve, and, on coming into the forward house at a quarter after eleven\r\no'clock to eat his night lunch, reported to Singleton that the captain\r\nwas in bed and that Mr. Turner had been asking for him. Singleton,\r\ntherefore, took his cap and went on deck.  This was about twenty\r\nminutes after eleven.  He had had a drink or two earlier in the\r\nevening, and he took another in his cabin when he got his cap.\r\n\r\nHe found Turner in the chart-house, playing solitaire and drinking. He\r\nwas alone, and he asked Singleton to join him.  The first mate looked\r\nat his watch and accepted the invitation, but decided to look around\r\nthe forward house to be sure the captain was asleep.  He went on deck.\r\nHe could hear Burns and the lookout talking.  The forward house was\r\ndark.  He listened outside the captain's door, and heard him breathing\r\nheavily, as if asleep.  He stood there for a moment. He had an uneasy\r\nfeeling that some one was watching him.  He thought of Schwartz, and\r\nwas uncomfortable.  He did not feel the whiskey at all.\r\n\r\nHe struck a light and looked around.  There was no one in sight. He\r\ncould hear Charlie Jones in the forecastle drumming on his banjo, and\r\nBurns whistling the same tune as he went aft to strike the bell. (It\r\nwas the duty of the officer on watch to strike the hour.)  It was then\r\nhalf after eleven.  As he passed the captain's door again, his foot\r\nstruck something, and it fell to the floor.  He was afraid the captain\r\nhad been roused, and stood still until he heard him breathing regularly\r\nagain.  Then he stooped down.  His foot had struck an axe upright\r\nagainst the captain's door, and had knocked it down.\r\n\r\nThe axe belonged on the outer wall of the forward house.  It was a rule\r\nthat it must not be removed from its place except in emergency, and the\r\nfirst mate carried it out and leaned it against the forward port corner\r\nof the after house when he went below.  Later, on his watch, he carried\r\nit forward and put it where it belonged.\r\n\r\nHe found Turner waiting on deck, and together they descended to the\r\nchart-room.  He was none too clear as to what followed.  They drank\r\ntogether.  Vail tried to get Turner to bed, and failed.  He believed\r\nthat Burns had called the captain.  The captain had ordered him to the\r\ndeck, and there had been a furious quarrel.  He felt ill by that time,\r\nand, when he went on watch at midnight, Burns was uncertain about\r\nleaving him.  He was not intoxicated, he maintained, until after\r\nhalf-past one.  He was able to strike the bell without difficulty, and\r\nspoke, each time he went aft, to Charlie Jones, who was at the wheel.\r\n\r\nAfter that, however, he suddenly felt strange.  He thought he had been\r\ndoped, and told the helmsman so.  He asked Jones to strike the bell for\r\nhim, and, going up on the forecastle head, lay down on the boards and\r\nfell asleep.  He did not waken until he heard six bells struck--three\r\no'clock.  And, before he had fully roused, I had called him.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" I said, \"when the lookout saw you with the axe, you were\r\nreplacing it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The lookout says you were not on deck between two and three o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does he know?  I was asleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had threatened to get the captain.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had a revolver; I didn't need to use an axe.\"\r\n\r\nMuch as I disliked the man, I was inclined to believe his story,\r\nalthough I thought he was keeping something back.  I leaned forward.\r\n\r\n\"Singleton,\" I said, \"if you didn't do it, and I want to think you did\r\nnot,--who did?\"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"We have women aboard.  We ought to know what precautions to take.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't the only man on deck that night.  Burns was about, and he had\r\na quarrel with the Hansen woman.  Jones was at the wheel, too. Why\r\ndon't you lock up Jones?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are all under suspicion,\" I admitted.  \"But you had threatened the\r\ncaptain.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never threatened the girl, or Mr. Vail.\"\r\n\r\nI had no answer to this, and we both fell silent.  Singleton was the\r\nfirst to speak:--\r\n\r\n\"How are you going to get back?  The men can sail a course, but who is\r\nto lay it out?  Turner?  No Turner ever knew anything about a ship but\r\nwhat it made for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Turner is sick.  Look here, Singleton, you want to get back as much as\r\nwe do, or more.  Wouldn't you be willing to lay a course, if you were\r\ntaken out once a day?  Burns is doing it, but he doesn't pretend to\r\nknow much about it, and--we have the bodies.\"\r\n\r\nBut he turned ugly again, and refused to help unless he was given his\r\nfreedom, and that I knew the crew would not agree to.\r\n\r\n\"You'll be sick enough before you get back!\" he snarled.\r\n\nWith the approach of night our vigilance was doubled.  There was no\r\nthought of sleep among the crew, and, with the twilight, there was a\r\ndistinct return of the terror of the morning.\r\n\r\nGathered around the wheel, the crew listened while Jones read evening\r\nprayer.  Between the two houses, where the deck was roped off, Miss Lee\r\nwas alone, pacing back and-forward, her head bent, her arms dropped\r\nlistlessly.\r\n\r\nThe wind had gone, and the sails hung loose over our heads.  I stood by\r\nthe port rail.  Although my back was toward Miss Lee, I was conscious\r\nof her every movement; and so I knew when she stooped under the rope\r\nand moved lightly toward the starboard rail.\r\n\r\nQuick as she was, I was quicker.  There was still light enough to see\r\nher face as she turned when I called to her:\r\n\r\n\"Miss Lee  You must not leave the rope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Must not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to seem arbitrary.  It is for your own safety.\"\r\n\r\nI was crossing the deck toward her as I spoke.  I knew what she was\r\ngoing to do.  I believe, when she saw my face, that she read my\r\nknowledge in it.  She turned back from the rail and faced me.\r\n\r\n\"Surely I may go to the rail!\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be unwise, if for no other reason than discipline.\"\r\n\r\n\"Discipline! Are you trying to discipline me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Lee, you do not seem to understand,\" I said, as patiently as I\r\ncould.  \"Just now I am in charge of the Ella.  It does not matter how\r\nunfit I am--the fact remains.  Nor does it concern me that your\r\nbrother-in-law owns the ship.  I am in charge of it, and, God willing,\r\nthere will be no more crimes on it.  You will go back to the part of\r\nthe deck that is reserved for you, or you will go below and stay there.\"\r\n\r\nShe flushed with anger, and stood there with her head thrown back,\r\neyeing me with a contempt that cut me to the quick.  The next moment\r\nshe wheeled and, raising her hand, flung toward the rail the key to the\r\nstoreroom door.  I caught her hand--too late.\r\n\r\nBut fate was on my side, after all.  As I stood, still gripping her\r\nwrist, the key fell ringing almost at my feet.  It had struck one of\r\nthe lower yard braces.  I stooped, and, picking it up, pocketed it.\r\n\r\nShe was dazed, I think.  She made no effort to free her arm, but she\r\nput her other hand to her heart unexpectedly, and I saw that she was\r\nprofoundly shocked.  I led her, unprotesting, to a deck-chair, and put\r\nher down in it; and still she had not spoken: She lay back and closed\r\nher eyes.  She was too strong to faint; she was superbly healthy.  But\r\nshe knew as well as I did what that key meant, and she had delivered it\r\ninto my hands.  As for me, I was driven hard that night; for, as I\r\nstood there looking down at her, she held out her hand to me, palm up.\r\n\r\n\"Please!\" she said pleadingly.  \"What does it mean to you, Leslie? We\r\nwere kind to you, weren't we?  When you were ill, we took you on, my\r\nsister and I, and now you hate us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hate you!\"\r\n\r\n\"He didn't know what he was doing.  He wasn't sane.  No sane man\r\nkills--that way.  He had a revolver, if he had wanted--Please give me\r\nthat key!\"\r\n\r\n\"Some one will suffer.  Would you have the innocent suffer with the\r\nguilty?\"\r\n\r\n\"If they cannot prove it against any one--\"\r\n\r\n\"They may prove it against me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You!\"\r\n\r\n\"I was in the after house,\" I said doggedly.  \"I was the one to raise\r\nan alarm and to find the bodies.  You do not know anything about me.  I\r\nam--'Elsa's jail-bird'!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who told you that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It does not matter--I know it.  I told you the truth, Miss Elsa; I\r\ncame here from the hospital.  But I may have to fight for my life.\r\nAgainst the Turner money and influence, I have only--this key. Shall I\r\ngive it to you?\"\r\n\r\nI held it out to her on the palm of my hand.  It was melodramatic,\r\nprobably; but I was very young, and by that time wildly in love with\r\nher.  I thought, for a moment, that she would take it; but she only\r\ndrew a deep breath and pushed my hand away.\r\n\r\n\"Keep it,\" she said.  \"I am ashamed.\"\r\n\r\nWe were silent after that, she staring out over the rail at the\r\ndeepening sky; and, looking at her as one looks at a star, I thought\r\nshe had forgotten my presence, so long she sat silent.  The voices of\r\nthe men aft died away gradually, as, one by one, they rolled themselves\r\nin blankets on the deck, not to sleep, but to rest and watch.  The\r\nlookout, in his lonely perch high above the deck, called down guardedly\r\nto ask for company, and one of the crew went up.\r\n\r\nWhen she turned to me again, it was to find my eyes fixed on her.\r\n\r\n\"You say you have neither money nor influence.  And yet, you are a\r\ngentleman.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know what I mean\"--impatiently.  \"You are not a common sailor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not claim to be one.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are quite determined we shall not know anything about you?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing to know.  I have given you my name, which is\r\npractically all I own in the world.  I needed a chance to recover from\r\nan illness, and I was obliged to work.  This offered the best\r\nopportunity to combine both.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not getting much chance--to rest,\" she said, with a sigh, and\r\ngot up.  I went with her to the companionway, and opened the door.  She\r\nturned and looked at me.\r\n\r\n\"Good-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, Miss Lee.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I feel very safe with you on guard,\" she said, and held out her\r\nhand.  I took it in mine, with my heart leaping.  It was as cold as ice.\r\n\r\nThat night, at four bells, I mustered the crew as silently as possible\r\naround the jollyboat, and we lowered it into the water. The possibility\r\nof a dead calm had convinced me that the sooner it was done the better.\r\nWe arranged to tow the boat astern, and Charlie Jones suggested a white\r\nlight in its bow, so we could be sure at night that it had not broken\r\nloose.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we attached to the bow of the jolly-boat a tailed block\r\nwith an endless fall riven through it, so as to be able to haul in and\r\nrefill the lantern.  Five bells struck by the time we had arranged the\r\ntowing-line.\r\n\r\nWe dropped the jolly-boat astern and made fast the rope.  It gave me a\r\ncurious feeling, that small boat rising and falling behind us, with its\r\ndead crew, and its rocking light, and, on its side above the\r\nwater-line, the black cross--a curious feeling of pursuit, as if,\r\nacross the water, they in the boat were following us.  And, perhaps\r\nbecause the light varied, sometimes it seemed to drop behind, as if\r\nwearying of the chase, and again, in great leaps, to be overtaking us,\r\nto be almost upon us.\r\n\r\nAn open boat with a small white light and a black cross on the side.\r\n\nThe night passed without incident, except for one thing that we were\r\nunable to verify.  At six bells, during the darkest hour of the night\r\nthat precedes the early dawn of summer, Adams, from the crow's-nest,\r\ncalled down, in a panic, that there was something crawling on all fours\r\non the deck below him.\r\n\r\nBurns, on watch at the companionway, ran forward with his revolver, and\r\nnarrowly escaped being brained--Adams at that moment flinging down a\r\nmarlinespike that he had carried aloft with him.\r\n\r\nI heard the crash and joined Burns, and together we went over the deck\r\nand, both houses.  Everything was quiet: the crew in various attitudes\r\nof exhausted sleep, their chests and dittybags around them; Oleson at\r\nthe wheel; and Singleton in his jail-room, breathing heavily.\r\n\r\nAdams's nerve was completely gone, and, being now thoroughly awake, I\r\njoined him in the crow's-nest.  Nothing could convince him that he had\r\nbeen the victim of a nervous hallucination.  He stuck to his story\r\nfirmly.\r\n\r\n\"It was on the forecastle-head first,\" he maintained.  \"I saw it\r\ngleaming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gleaming?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sort of shining,\" he explained.  \"It came up over the rail, and at\r\nfirst it stood up tall, like a white post.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't say before that it was white.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was shining,\" he said slowly, trying to put his idea into words.\r\n\"Maybe not exactly white, but light-colored.  It stood still for so\r\nlong, I thought I must be mistaken--that it was a light on the rigging.\r\nThen I got to thinking that there wasn't no place for a light to come\r\nfrom just there.\"\r\n\r\nThat was true enough.\r\n\r\n\"First it was as tall as a man, or taller maybe,\" he went on. \"Then it\r\nseemed about half that high and still in the same place. Then it got\r\nlower still, and it took to crawling along on its belly.  It was then I\r\nyelled.\"\r\n\r\nI looked down.  The green starboard light threw a light over only a\r\nsmall part of the deck.  The red light did no better.  The masthead was\r\npossibly thirty feet above the hull, and served no illuminating purpose\r\nwhatever.  From the bridge forward the deck was practically dark.\r\n\r\n\"You yelled, and then what happened?\"\r\n\r\nHis reply was vague--troubled.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" he said slowly.  \"It seemed to fade away.  The white\r\ngot smaller--went to nothing, like a cloud blown away in a gale. I\r\nflung the spike.\"\r\n\r\nI accepted the story with outward belief and a mental reservation. But\r\nI did not relish the idea of the spike Adams had thrown lying below on\r\ndeck.  No more formidable weapon short of an axe, could be devised.  I\r\nsaid as much.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going down for it,\" I said; \"if you're nervous, you'd better keep\r\nit by you.  But don't drop it on everything that moves below. You\r\nalmost got Burns.\"\r\n\r\nI went down cautiously, and struck a match where Adams had indicated\r\nthe spike.  It was not there.  Nor had Burns picked it up.  A\r\nsplintered board showed where it had struck, and a smaller indentation\r\nwhere it had rebounded; but the marlinespike was gone, and Burns had\r\nnot seen it.  We got a lantern and searched systematically, without\r\nresult.  Burns turned to me a face ghastly in the oil light.\r\n\r\n\"Somebody has it,\" he said, \"and there will be more murder! Oh, my God,\r\nLeslie!\"\r\n\r\n\"When you went back after the alarm, did you count the men?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; Oleson said no one had come forward.  They could not have passed\r\nwithout his seeing them.  He has the binnacle lantern and two other\r\nlights.\"\r\n\r\n\"And no one came from the after house?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one.\"\r\n\r\nEight bells rang out sharply.  The watch changed.  I took the revolver\r\nand Burns's position at the companionway, while Burns went aft.  He\r\nlined up the men by the binnacle light, and went over them carefully.\r\nThe marlinespike was not found; but he took from the cook a long\r\nmeat-knife, and brought both negro and knife forward to me.  The man\r\nwas almost collapsing with terror.  He maintained that he had taken the\r\nknife for self-protection, and we let him go with a warning.\r\n\r\nDawn brought me an hour's sleep, the first since my awakening in the\r\nstoreroom.  When I roused, Jones at the wheel had thrown an extra\r\nblanket over me, for the morning was cool and a fine rain was\r\nfalling.\r\n\r\nThe men were scattered around in attitudes of dejection, one or two of\r\nthem leaning over the rail, watching the jolly-boat, riding easily\r\nbehind us.  Jones heard me moving, and turned.\r\n\r\n\"Your friend below must be pretty bad, sir,\" he said.  \"Your lady-love\r\nhas been asking for you.  I wouldn't let them wake you.\"\r\n\r\n\"My--what?\"\r\n\r\nHe waxed apologetic at once.\r\n\r\n\"That's just my foolishness, Leslie,\" he said.  \"No disrespect to the\r\nlady, I'm sure.  If it ain't so, it ain't, and no harm done. If it is\r\nso, why, you needn't be ashamed, boy.  'The way of a man with a maid,'\r\nsays the Book.\"\r\n\r\n\"You should have called me, Jones,\" I said sharply.  \"And no nonsense\r\nof that sort with the men.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked hurt, but made no reply beyond touching his cap.  And, while\r\nI am mentioning that, I may speak of the changed attitude of the men\r\ntoward me from the time they put me in charge.  Whether the deference\r\nwas to the office rather than the man, or whether in placing me in\r\nauthority they had merely expressed a general feeling that I was with\r\nthem rather than of them, I do not know.  I am inclined to think the\r\nformer.  The result, in any case, was the same. They deferred to me\r\nwhenever possible, brought large and small issues alike to me, served\r\nme my food alone, against my protestations, and, while navigating the\r\nship on their own responsibility, took care to come to me for authority\r\nfor everything.\r\n\r\nBefore I went below that morning, I suggested that some of the spare\r\ncanvas be used to erect a shelter on the after deck, and this was done.\r\nThe rain by that time was driving steadily--a summer rain without wind.\r\nThe men seemed glad to have occupation, and, from that time on, the\r\ntent which they erected over the hatchway aft of the wheel was their\r\nliving and eating quarters.  It added something to their comfort: I was\r\nnot so certain that it added to their security.\r\n\r\nTurner was violent that day.  I found all four women awake and dressed,\r\nand Mrs. Turner, whose hour it was on duty, in a chair outside the\r\ndoor.  The stewardess, her arm in a sling, was making tea over a\r\nspirit-lamp, and Elsa was helping her.  Mrs. Johns was stretched on a\r\ndivan, and on the table lay a small revolver.\r\n\r\nClearly, Elsa had told the incident of the key.  I felt at once the\r\natmosphere of antagonism.  Mrs. Johns watched me coolly from under\r\nlowered eyelids.  The stewardess openly scowled.  And Mrs. Turner rose\r\nhastily, and glanced at Mrs. Johns, as if in doubt.  Elsa had her back\r\nto me, and was busy with the cups.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid you've had a bad night,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"A very bad night,\" Mrs. Turner replied stiffly.\r\n\r\n\"Delirium?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very marked.  He has talked of a white figure--we cannot quite make it\r\nout.  It seems to be Wilmer--Mr. Vail.\"\r\n\r\nShe had not opened the door, but stood, nervously twisting her fingers,\r\nbefore it.\r\n\r\n\"The bromides had no effect?\"\r\n\r\nShe glanced helplessly at the others.  \"None,\" she said, after a moment.\r\n\r\nElsa Lee wheeled suddenly and glanced scornfully at her sister.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you tell him?\" she demanded.  \"Why don't you say you didn't\r\ngive the bromides?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Johns raised herself on her elbow and looked at me.\r\n\r\n\"Why should we?\" she asked.  \"How do we know what you are giving him?\r\nYou are not friendly to him or to us.  We know what you are trying to\r\ndo--you are trying to save yourself, at any cost.  You put a guard at\r\nthe companionway.  You rail off the deck for our safety.  You drop the\r\nstoreroom key in Mr. Turner's cabin, where Elsa will find it, and will\r\nbe obliged to acknowledge she found it, and then take it from her by\r\nforce, so you can show it later on and save yourself!\"\r\n\r\nElsa turned on her quickly.\r\n\r\n\"I told you how he got it, Adele.  I tried to throw it--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if you intend to protect him!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am rather bewildered,\" I said slowly; \"but, under the circumstances,\r\nI suppose you do not wish me to look after Mr. Turner?\"\r\n\r\n\"We think not\"--from Mrs. Turner.\r\n\r\n\"How will you manage alone?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Johns got up and lounged to the table.  She wore a long satin\r\nnegligee of some sort, draped with lace.  It lay around her on the\r\nfloor in gleaming lines of soft beauty.  Her reddish hair was low on\r\nher neck, and she held a cigarette, negligently, in her teeth. All the\r\nwomen smoked, Mrs. Johns incessantly.\r\n\r\nShe laid one hand lightly on the revolver, and flicked the ash from her\r\ncigarette with the other.\r\n\r\n\"We have decided,\" she said insolently, \"that, if the crew may\r\nestablish a dead-line, so may we.  Our dead-line is the foot of the\r\ncompanionway.  One of us will be on watch always.  I am an excellent\r\nshot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not doubt it.\" I faced her.  \"I am afraid you will suffer for\r\nair; otherwise, the arrangement is good.  You relieve me of part of the\r\nresponsibility for your safety.  Tom will bring your food to the steps\r\nand leave it there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"With good luck, two weeks will see us in port; and then--\"\r\n\r\n\"In port! You are taking us back?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\nShe picked up the revolver and examined it absently.  Then she glanced\r\nat me, and shrugged her shoulders.  \"How can we know? Perhaps this is a\r\nmutiny, and you are on your way to some God forsaken island.  That's\r\nthe usual thing among pirates, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no answer to that, Mrs. Johns,\" I said quietly, and turned to\r\nwhere Elsa sat.\r\n\r\n\"I shall not come back unless you send for me,\" I said.  \"But I want\r\nyou to know that my one object in life from now on is to get you back\r\nsafely to land; that your safety comes first, and that the vigilance on\r\ndeck in your interest will not be relaxed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine words!\" the stewardess muttered.\r\n\r\nThe low mumbling from Turner's room had persisted steadily.  Now it\r\nrose again in the sharp frenzy that had characterized it through the\r\nlong night.\r\n\r\n\"Don't look at me like that, man!\" he cried, and then \"He's lost a\r\nhand!  A hand!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Turner went quickly into the cabin, and the sounds ceased.  I\r\nlooked at Elsa, but she avoided my eyes.  I turned heavily and went up\r\nthe companionway.\r\n\nIt rained heavily all that day.  Late in the afternoon we got some\r\nwind, and all hands turned out to trim sail.  Action was a relief, and\r\nthe weather suited our disheartened state better than had the pitiless\r\nAugust sun, the glaring white of deck and canvas, and the heat.\r\n\r\nThe heavy drops splashed and broke on top of the jolly-boat, and, as\r\nthe wind came up, it rode behind us like a live thing.\r\n\r\nOur distress signal hung sodden, too wet to give more than a dejected\r\nresponse to the wind that tugged at it.  Late in the afternoon we\r\nsighted a large steamer, and when, as darkness came on, she showed no\r\nindication of changing her course, Burns and I sent up a rocket and\r\nblew the fog horn steadily.  She altered her course then and came\r\ntowards us, and we ran up our code flags for immediate assistance; but\r\nshe veered off shortly after, and went on her way.  We made no further\r\neffort to attract her attention. Burns thought her a passenger steamer\r\nfor the Bermudas, and, as her way was not ours, she could not have been\r\nof much assistance.\r\n\r\nOne or two of the men were already showing signs of strain.  Oleson,\r\nthe Swede, developed a chill, followed by fever and a mild delirium,\r\nand Adams complained of sore throat and nausea.  Oleson's illness was\r\ngenuine enough.  Adams I suspected of malingering.  He had told the men\r\nhe would not go up to the crow's-nest again without a revolver, and\r\nthis I would not permit.\r\n\r\nOur original crew had numbered nine--with the cook and Williams,\r\neleven.  But the two Negroes were not seamen, and were frightened into\r\na state bordering on collapse.  Of the men actually useful, there were\r\nleft only five: Clarke, McNamara, Charlie Jones, Burns, and myself; and\r\nI was a negligible quantity as regarded the working of the ship.\r\n\r\nWith Burns and myself on guard duty, the burden fell on Clarke,\r\nMcNamara, and Jones.  A suggestion of mine that we release Singleton\r\nwas instantly vetoed by the men.  It was arranged, finally, that Clarke\r\nand McNamara take alternate watches at the wheel, and Jones be given\r\nthe lookout for the night, to be relieved by either Burns or myself.\r\n\r\nI watched the weather anxiously.  We were too short-handed to manage\r\nany sort of a gale; and yet, the urgency of our return made it unwise\r\nto shorten canvas too much.  It was as well, perhaps, that I had so\r\nmuch to distract my mind from the situation in the after house.\r\n\r\nThe second of the series of curious incidents that complicated our\r\nreturn voyage occurred that night.  I was on watch from eight bells\r\nmidnight until four in the morning.  Jones was in the crow's-nest,\r\nMcNamara at the wheel.  I was at the starboard forward corner of the\r\nafter house, looking over the rail.  I thought that I had seen the\r\nlights of a steamer.\r\n\r\nThe rain had ceased, but the night was still very dark.  I heard a sort\r\nof rapping from the forward house, and took a step toward it,\r\nlistening.  Jones heard it, too, and called down to me, nervously, to\r\nsee what was wrong.\r\n\r\nI called up to him, cautiously, to come down and take my place while I\r\ninvestigated.  I thought it was Singleton.  When Jones had taken up his\r\nposition at the companionway, I went forward.  The knocking continued,\r\nand I traced it to Singleton's cabin.  His window was open, being too\r\nsmall for danger, but barred across with strips of wood outside, like\r\nthose in the after house.  But he was at the door, hammering\r\nfrantically.  I called to him through the open window, but the only\r\nanswer was renewed and louder pounding.\r\n\r\nI ran around to his door, and felt for the key, which I carried.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" I called.\r\n\r\n\"Who is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Leslie.\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, open the door!\"\r\n\r\nI unlocked it and threw it open.  He retreated before me, with his\r\nhands out, and huddled against the wall beside the window.  I struck a\r\nmatch.  His face was drawn and distorted, and he held his arm up as if\r\nto ward off a blow.\r\n\r\nI lighted the lamp, for there were no electric lights in the forward\r\nhouse, and stared at him, amazed.  Satisfied that I was really Leslie,\r\nhe had stooped, and was fumbling under the window.  When he\r\nstraightened, he held something out to me in the palm of his shaking\r\nhand.  I saw, with surprise, that it was a tobacco-pouch.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" I demanded.\r\n\r\n\"It was on the ledge,\" he said hoarsely.  \"I put it there myself. All\r\nthe time I was pounding, I kept saying that, if it was still there, it\r\nwas not true--I'd just fancied it.  If the pouch was on the floor, I'd\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Know what?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was there,\" he said, looking over his shoulder.  \"It's been there\r\nthree times, looking in--all in white, and grinning at me.\"\r\n\r\n\"A man?\"\r\n\r\n\"It--it hasn't got any face.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could it grin--at you if it hasn't any face?\" I demanded\r\nimpatiently.  \"Pull yourself together and tell me what you saw.\"\r\n\r\nIt was some time before he could tell a connected story, and, when he\r\ndid, I was inclined to suspect that he had heard us talking the night\r\nbefore, had heard Adams's description of the intruder on the\r\nforecastle-head, and that, what with drink and terror, he had fancied\r\nthe rest.  And yet, I was not so sure.\r\n\r\n\"I was asleep, the first time,\" he said.  \"I don't know how long ago it\r\nwas.  I woke up cold, with the feeling that something was looking at\r\nme.  I raised up in bed, and there was a thing at the window.  It was\r\nlooking in.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of a thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"What I told you--white.\"\r\n\r\n\"A white head?\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't a head.  For God's sake, Leslie! I can't tell you any more\r\nthan that.  I saw it.  That's enough.  I saw it three times.\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't enough for me,\" I said doggedly.  \"It hadn't any head or\r\nface, but it looked in! It's dark out there.  How could you see?\"\r\n\r\nFor reply, he leaned over and, turning down the lamp, blew it out. We\r\nsat in the smoking darkness, and slowly, out of the thick night, the\r\nwindow outlined itself.  I could see it distinctly.  But how, white and\r\nfaceless, had it stared in at the window, or reached through the bars,\r\nas Singleton declared it had done, and waved a fingerless hand at us?\r\n\r\nHe was in a state of mental and physical collapse, and begged so\r\npitifully not to be left, that at last I told him I would take him with\r\nme, on his promise to remain in a chair until dawn, and to go back\r\nwithout demur.  He sat near me, amidships, huddled down among the\r\ncushions of one of the wicker chairs, not sleeping, but staring\r\nstraight out, motionless.\r\n\r\nWith the first light of dawn Burns relieved me, and I went forward with\r\nSingleton.  He dropped into his bunk, and was asleep almost\r\nimmediately.  Then, inch by inch, I went over the deck for footprints,\r\nfor any clue to what, under happier circumstances, I should have\r\nconsidered a ghastly hoax.  But the deck was slippery and sodden, the\r\nrail dripping, and between the davits where the jolly-boat had swung\r\nwas stretched a line with a shirt of Burns's hung on it, absurdly\r\nenough, to dry.  Poor Burns, promoted to the dignity of first mate, and\r\ntrying to dress the part!\r\n\r\nOleson and Adams made no attempt to work that day; indeed, Oleson was\r\nnot able.  As I had promised, the breakfast for the after house was\r\nplaced on the companion steps by Tom, the cook, whence it was removed\r\nby Mrs. Sloane.  I saw nothing of either Elsa Lee or Mrs. Johns.  Burns\r\nwas inclined to resent the deadline the women had drawn below, and\r\nsuggested that, since they were so anxious to take care of themselves,\r\nwe give up guarding the after house and let them do it.  We were\r\nshort-handed enough, he urged, and, if they were going to take that\r\nattitude, let them manage.  I did not argue, but my eyes traveled over\r\nthe rail to where the jolly-boat rose to meet the fresh sea of the\r\nmorning, and he colored.  After that he made no comment.\r\n\r\nSingleton awakened before noon, and ate his first meal since the\r\nmurders.  He looked better, and we had a long talk, I outside the\r\nwindow and he within.  He held to his story of the night before, but\r\nwas still vague as to just how the thing looked.  Of what it was he\r\nseemed to have no doubt.  It was the specter of either the captain or\r\nVail; he excluded the woman, because she was shorter.  As I stood\r\noutside, he measured on me the approximate height of the\r\napparition--somewhere about five feet eight.  He could see Burns's\r\nshirt, he admitted, but the thing had been close to the window.\r\n\r\nI found myself convinced against my will, and that afternoon, alone, I\r\nmade a second and more thorough examination of the forecastle and the\r\nhold.  In the former I found nothing.  Having been closed for over\r\ntwenty-four hours, it was stifling and full of odors.  The crew,\r\nabandoning it in haste, had left it in disorder.  I made a systematic\r\nsearch, beginning forward and working back.  I prodded in and under\r\nbunks, and moved the clothing that hung on every hook and swung, to the\r\nundoing of my nerves, with every swell.  Much curious salvage I found\r\nunder mattresses and beneath bunks: a rosary and a dozen filthy\r\npictures under the same pillow; more than one bottle of whiskey; and\r\neven, where it had been dropped in the haste of flight, a bottle of\r\ncocaine.  The bottle set me to thinking: had we a \"coke\" fiend on\r\nboard, and, if we had, who was it?\r\n\r\nThe examination of the hold led to one curious and not easily explained\r\ndiscovery.  The Ella was in gravel ballast, and my search there was\r\ndifficult and nerve-racking.  The creaking of the girders and\r\nfloor-plates, the groaning overhead of the trestle-trees, and once an\r\nunexpected list that sent me careening, head first, against a\r\nballast-tank, made my position distinctly disagreeable.  And above all\r\nthe incidental noises of a ship's hold was one that I could not\r\nplace--a regular knocking, which kept time with the list of the boat.\r\n\r\nI located it at last, approximately, at one of the ballast ports, but\r\nthere was nothing to be seen.  The port had been carefully barred and\r\ncalked over.  The sound was not loud.  Down there among the other\r\nnoises, I seemed to feel as well as hear it.  I sent Burns down, and he\r\ncame up, puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"It's outside,\" he said.  \"Something cracking against her ribs.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't notice it yesterday, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but yesterday we were not listening for noises.\"\r\n\r\nThe knocking was on the port side.  We went forward together, and,\r\nleaning well out, looked over the rail.\r\n\r\nThe missing marlinespike was swinging there, banging against the hull\r\nwith every roll of the ship.  It was fastened by a rope lanyard to a\r\nlarge bolt below the rail, and fastened with what Burns called a\r\nBlackwall hitch--a sailor's knot.\r\n\nI find, from my journal, that the next seven days passed without marked\r\nincident.  Several times during that period we sighted vessels, all\r\noutward bound, and once we were within communicating distance of a\r\nsteam cargo boat on her way to Venezuela.  She lay to and sent her\r\nfirst mate over to see what could be done.\r\n\r\nHe was a slim little man with dark eyes and a small mustache above a\r\ncheerful mouth.  He listened in silence to my story, and shuddered when\r\nI showed him the jolly-boat.  But we were only a few days out by that\r\ntime, and, after all, what could they do?  He offered to spare us a\r\nhand, if it could be arranged; but, Adams having recovered by that\r\ntime, we decided to get along as we were.  A strange sight we must have\r\npresented to the tidy little officer in his uniform and black tie: a\r\nhaggard, unshaven lot of men, none too clean, all suffering from strain\r\nand lack of sleep, with nerves ready to snap; a white yacht,\r\nmotionless, her sails drooping,--for not a breath of air moved,--with\r\nunpolished brasses and dirty decks; in charge of all, a tall youth,\r\nunshaven like the rest, and gaunt from sickness, who hardly knew a\r\nnautical phrase, who shook the little officer's hand with a ferocity of\r\nwelcome that made him change color, and whose uniform consisted of a\r\npair of dirty khaki trousers and a khaki shirt, open at the neck; and\r\nbehind us, wallowing in the trough of the sea as the Ella lay to, the\r\njolly-boat, so miscalled, with its sinister cargo.\r\n\r\nThe Buenos Aires went on, leaving us a bit cheered, perhaps, but none\r\nthe better off, except that she verified our bearings.  The after house\r\nhad taken no notice of the incident.  None of the women had appeared,\r\nnor did they make any inquiry of the cook when he carried down their\r\ndinner that night.  As entirely as possible, during the week that had\r\npassed, they had kept to themselves.  Turner was better, I imagined;\r\nbut, the few times when Elsa Lee appeared at the companion for a breath\r\nof air, I was off duty and missed her.  I thought it was by design, and\r\nI was desperate for a sight of her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Johns came on deck once or twice while I was there, but she chose\r\nto ignore me.  The stewardess, however, was not so partisan, and, the\r\nday before we met the Buenos Aires, she spent a little time on deck,\r\nleaning against the rail and watching me with alert black eyes.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do when you get to land, Mr. Captain Leslie?\"\r\nshe asked.  \"Are you going to put us all in prison?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's as may be,\" I evaded.  She was a pretty little woman, plump and\r\ndark, and she slid her hand along the rail until it touched mine.\r\nWhereon, I did the thing she was expecting, and put my fingers over\r\nhers.  She flushed a little, and dimpled.\r\n\r\n\"You are human, aren't you?\" she asked archly.  \"I am not afraid of\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one is, I am sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Silly!  Why, they are all afraid of you, down there.\"  She jerked her\r\nhead toward the after house.  \"They want to offer you something, but\r\nnone of them will do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Offer me something?\"\r\n\r\nShe came a little closer, so that her round shoulder touched mine.\r\n\r\n\"Why not? You need money, I take it.  And that's the one thing they\r\nhave--money.\"\r\n\r\nI began to understand her.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" I said slowly.  \"They want to bribe me.\"\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"That is a nasty word.  They might wish to buy--a key or two that you\r\ncarry.\"\r\n\r\n\"The storeroom key, of course.  But what other?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked around--we were alone.  A light breeze filled the sails and\r\nflicked the end of a scarf she wore against my face.\r\n\r\n\"The key to the captain's cabin,\" she said, very low.\r\n\r\nThat was what they wished to buy: the incriminating key to the\r\nstoreroom, found on Turner's floor, and access to the axe, with its\r\ntelltale prints on the handle.\r\n\r\nThe stewardess saw my face harden, and put her hand on my arm.\r\n\r\n\"Now I am afraid of you!\" she cried: \"When you look like that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Sloane,\" I said, \"I do not know that you were asked to do this--I\r\nthink not.  But if you were, say for me what I am willing to say for\r\nmyself: I shall tell what I know, and there is not money enough in the\r\nworld to prevent my telling it straight.  The right man is going to be\r\npunished, and the key to the storeroom will be given to the police, and\r\nto no one else.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--the other key?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not in my keeping.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not believe you!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry,\" I said shortly.  \"As a matter of fact, Burns has that.\"\r\n\r\nBy the look of triumph in her eyes I knew I had told her what she\r\nwanted to know.  She went below soon after, and I warned Burns that he\r\nwould probably be approached in the same way.\r\n\r\n\"Not that I am afraid,\" I added.  \"But keep the little Sloane woman at\r\na distance.  She's quite capable of mesmerizing you with her eyes and\r\nrobbing you with her hands at the same time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather you'd carry it,\" he said, \"although I'm not afraid of the\r\nlady.  It's not likely, after--\"\r\n\r\nHe did not finish, but he glanced aft toward the jollyboat.  Poor\r\nBurns! I believe he had really cared for the Danish girl.  Perhaps I\r\nwas foolish, but I refused to take the key from him; I felt sure he\r\ncould be trusted.\r\n\r\nThe murders had been committed on the early morning of Wednesday, the\r\n12th.  It was on the following Tuesday that Mrs. Sloane and I had our\r\nlittle conversation on deck, and on Wednesday we came up with the\r\nBuenos Aires.\r\n\r\nIt was on Friday, therefore, two days after the cargo steamer had slid\r\nover the edge of the ocean, and left us, motionless, a painted ship\r\nupon a painted sea, that the incident happened that completed the\r\ndemoralization of the crew.\r\n\r\nFor almost a week the lookouts had reported \"All's well\" in response to\r\nthe striking of the ship's bell.  The hysteria, as Burns and I dubbed\r\nit, of the white figure had died away as the men's nerves grew less\r\nirritated.  Although we had found no absolute explanation of the\r\nmarlinespike, an obvious one suggested itself.  The men, although\r\ngiving up their weapons without protest, had grumbled somewhat over\r\nbeing left without means of defense.  It was entirely possible, we\r\nagreed, that the marlinespike had been so disposed, as some seaman's\r\nresort in time of need.\r\n\r\nThe cook, taking down the dinner on Friday evening, reported Mr. Turner\r\nup and about and partly dressed.  The heat was frightful. All day we\r\nhad had a following breeze, and it had been necessary to lengthen the\r\ntowing-rope, dropping the jolly-boat well behind us. The men, saying\r\nlittle or nothing, dozed under their canvas; the helmsman drooped at\r\nthe wheel.  Under our feet the boards sent up simmering heat waves, and\r\nthe brasses were too hot to touch.\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock Elsa Lee came on deck, and spoke to me for the first\r\ntime in several days.  She started when she saw me, and no wonder.  In\r\nthe frenzied caution of the day after the crimes, I had flung every\r\nrazor overboard, and the result was as villainous a set of men as I\r\nhave ever seen.\r\n\r\n\"Have you been ill again?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nI put my hand to my chin.  \"Not ill,\" I said; \"merely unshaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are pale, and your eyes are sunk in your head.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are very short-handed and--no one has slept much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or eaten at all, I imagine,\" she said.  \"When do we get in?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can hardly say.  With this wind, perhaps Tuesday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Philadelphia.\"\r\n\r\n\"You intend to turn the yacht over to the police?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss Lee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every one on it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is up to the police.  They will probably not hold the women. You\r\nwill be released, I imagine, on your own recognizance.\"\r\n\r\n\"And--Mr.  Turner?\"\r\n\r\n\"He will have to take his luck with the rest of us.\"\r\n\r\nShe asked me no further questions, but switched at once to what had\r\nbrought her on deck.\r\n\r\n\"The cabin is unbearable,\" she said.  \"We are willing to take the risk\r\nof opening the after companion door.\"\r\n\r\nBut I could not allow this, and I tried to explain my reasons.  The\r\ncrew were quartered there, for one; for the other, whether they were\r\nwilling to take the risk or not, I would not open it without placing a\r\nguard there, and we had no one to spare for the duty.  I suggested that\r\nthey use the part of the deck reserved for them, where it was fairly\r\ncool under the awning; and, after a dispute below, they agreed to this.\r\nTurner, very weak, came up the few steps slowly, but refused my\r\nproffered help.  A little later, he called me from the rail and offered\r\nme a cigar.  The change in him was startling.\r\n\r\nWe took advantage of their being on deck to open the windows and air\r\nthe after house.  But all were securely locked and barred before they\r\nwent below again.  It was the first time they had all been on deck\r\ntogether since the night of the 11th.  It was a different crowd of\r\npeople that sat there, looking over the rail and speaking in\r\nmonosyllables: no bridge, no glasses clinking with ice, no elaborate\r\ntoilets and carefully dressed hair, no flash of jewels, no light\r\nlaughter following one of poor Vail's sallies.\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock they went below, but not until I had quietly located\r\nevery member of the crew.  I had the watch from eight to twelve that\r\nnight, and at half after ten Mrs. Johns came on deck again.  She did\r\nnot speak to me, but dropped into a steamer-chair and yawned,\r\nstretching out her arms.  By the light of the companion lantern, I saw\r\nthat she had put on one of the loose negligees she affected for\r\nundress, and her arms were bare except for a fall of lace.\r\n\r\nAt eight bells (midnight) Burns took my place.  Charlie Jones was at\r\nthe wheel, and McNamara in the crow's-nest.  Mrs. Johns was dozing in\r\nher chair.  The yacht was making perhaps four knots, and, far behind,\r\nthe small white light of the jolly-boat showed where she rode.\r\n\r\nI slept heavily, and at eight bells I rolled off my blanket and\r\nprepared to relieve Burns.  I was stiff, weary, unrefreshed.  The air\r\nwas very still and we were hardly moving.  I took a pail of water that\r\nstood near the rail, and, leaning far out, poured it over my head and\r\nshoulders.  As I turned, dripping, Jones, relieved of the wheel,\r\ntouched me on the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Go back to sleep, boy,\" he said kindly.  \"We need you, and we're goin'\r\nto need you more when we get ashore.  You've been talkin' in your sleep\r\ntill you plumb scared me.\"\r\n\r\nBut I was wide awake by that time, and he had had as little sleep as I\r\nhad.  I refused, and we went forward together, Jones to get coffee,\r\nwhich stood all night on the galley stove.\r\n\r\nIt was still dark.  The dawn, even in the less than four weeks we had\r\nbeen out, came perceptibly later.  At the port forward corner of the\r\nafter house, Jones stumbled over something, and gave a sharp\r\nexclamation.  The next moment he was on his knees, lighting a match.\r\n\r\nBurns lay there on his face, unconscious, and bleeding profusely from a\r\ncut on the back of his head--but not dead.\r\n\nMy first thought was of the after house.  Jones, who had been fond of\r\nBurns, was working over him, muttering to himself.  I felt his heart,\r\nwhich was beating slowly but regularly, and, convinced that he was not\r\ndying, ran down into the after house.  The cabin was empty: evidently\r\nthe guard around the pearl handled revolver had been given up on the\r\nfalse promise of peace.  All the lights were going, however, and the\r\nheat was suffocating.\r\n\r\nI ran to Miss Lee's door, and tried it.  It was locked, but almost\r\ninstantly she spoke from inside:\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing much.  Can you come out?\"\r\n\r\nShe came a moment later, and I asked her to call into each cabin to see\r\nif every one was safe.  The result was reassuring--no one had been\r\ndisturbed; and I was put to it to account to Miss Lee for my anxiety\r\nwithout telling her what had happened.  I made some sort of excuse,\r\nwhich I have forgotten, except that she evidently did not believe it.\r\n\r\nOn deck, the men were gathered around Burns.  There were ominous faces\r\namong them, and mutterings of hatred and revenge; for Burns had been\r\npopular--the best-liked man among them all.  Jones, wrought to the\r\nhighest pitch, had even shed a few shamefaced tears, and was\r\nobliterating the humiliating memory by an extra brusqueness of manner.\r\n\r\nWe carried the injured man aft, and with such implements as I had I\r\ncleaned and dressed the wound.  It needed sewing, and it seemed best to\r\ndo it before he regained consciousness.  Jones and Adams went below to\r\nthe forecastle, therefore, and brought up my amputating set, which\r\ncontained, besides its knives, some curved needles and surgical silk,\r\nstill in good condition.\r\n\r\nI opened the case, and before the knives, the long surgeon's knives\r\nwhich were in use before the scalpel superseded them, they fell back,\r\nmuttering and amazed.\r\n\r\nI did not know that Elsa Lee also was watching until, having requested\r\nJones, who had been a sailmaker, to thread the needles, his trembling\r\nhands refused their duty.  I looked up, searching the group for a\r\ncompetent assistant, and saw the girl.  She had dressed, and the light\r\nfrom the lantern beside me on the deck threw into relief her white\r\nfigure among the dark ones.  She came forward as my eyes fell on her.\r\n\r\n\"Let me try,\" she said; and, kneeling by the lantern, in a moment she\r\nheld out the threaded needle.  Her hand was quite steady.  She made an\r\nable assistant, wiping clean the oozing edges of the wound so that I\r\ncould see to clip the bleeding vessels, and working deftly with the\r\nsilk and needles to keep me supplied.  My old case yielded also a roll\r\nor so of bandage.  By the time Burns was attempting an incoordinate\r\nmovement or two, the operation was over and the instruments put out of\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nHis condition was good.  The men carried him to the tent, where Jones\r\nsat beside him, and the other men stood outside, uneasy and watchful,\r\nlooking in.\r\n\r\nThe operating-case, with its knives, came in for its share of scrutiny,\r\nand I felt that an explanation was due the men.  To tell the truth, I\r\nhad forgotten all about the case.  Perhaps I swaggered just a bit as I\r\nwent over to wash my hands.  It was my first opportunity, and I was\r\nyoung, and the Girl was there.\r\n\r\n\"I see you looking at my case, boys,\" I said.  \"Perhaps I'm a little\r\nlate explaining, but I guess after what you've seen you'll understand.\r\nThe case belonged to my grandfather, who was a surgeon.  He was in the\r\nwar.  That case was at Gettysburg.\"\r\n\r\n\"And because of your grandfather you brought it on shipboard!\" Clarke\r\nsaid nastily.\r\n\r\n\"No.  I'm a cub doctor myself.  I'd been sick, and I needed the sea and\r\na rest.\"\r\n\r\nThey were not so impressed as I had expected--or perhaps they had known\r\nall along.  Sailors are a secretive lot.\r\n\r\n\"I'm thinking we'll all be getting a rest soon,\" a voice said.  \"What\r\nare you going to do with them knives?\"\r\n\r\nI had an inspiration.  \"I'm going to leave that to you men,\" I said.\r\n\"You may throw them overboard, if you wish--but, if you do, take out\r\nthe needles and the silk; we may need them.\"\r\n\r\nThere followed a savage but restrained argument among the men. Jones,\r\nfrom the tent, called out irritably:--\r\n\r\n\"Don't be fools, you fellows.  This happened while Leslie was asleep.\r\nI'll swear he never moved after he lay down.\"\r\n\r\nThe crew reached a decision shortly after that, and came to me in a\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\"We think,\" Oleson said, \"that we'll lock them in the captain's cabin,\r\nwith the axe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" I said.  \"Burns has the key around his neck.\"\r\n\r\nClarke, I think it was, went into the tent, and came out again directly.\r\n\r\n\"There's no key around his neck,\" he said gruffly.\r\n\r\n\"It may have slipped around under his back.\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't there at all.\"\r\n\r\nI ran into the tent, where Jones, having exhausted the resources of the\r\ninjured man's clothing, was searching among the blankets on which he\r\nlay.  There was no key.  I went out to the men again, bewildered. The\r\ndawn had come, a pink and rosy dawn that promised another stifling day.\r\nIt revealed the disarray of the deck--the basins, the old mahogany\r\namputating-case with its lock plate of bone, the stained and reddened\r\ntowels; and it showed the brooding and overcast faces of the men.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it there?\" I asked.  \"Our agreement was for me to carry the key\r\nto Singleton's cabin and Burns the captain's.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Lee, by the rail, came forward slowly, and looked up at me.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it possible,\" she said, \"that, knowing where the key was, some\r\none wished to get it, and so--\"  She indicated the tent and Burns.\r\n\r\nI knew then.  How dull I had been, and stupid!  The men caught her\r\nmeaning, too, and we tramped heavily forward, the girl and I leading.\r\n\r\nThe door into the captain's room was open, and the axe was gone from\r\nthe bunk.  The key, with the cord that Burns had worn around his neck,\r\nwas in the door, the string torn and pulled as if it had been jerked\r\naway from the unconscious man.  Later on we verified this by finding,\r\non the back of Burns's neck an abraded line two inches or so in length.\r\n\r\nIt was a strong cord--the kind a sailor pins his faith to, and uses\r\nindiscriminately to hold his trousers or his knife.\r\n\r\nI ordered a rigid search of the deck, but the axe was gone.  Nor was it\r\never found.  It had taken its bloody story many fathoms deep into the\r\nold Atlantic, and hidden it, where many crimes have been hidden, in the\r\nooze and slime of the sea-bottom.\r\n\r\nThat day was memorable for more than the attack on Burns.  It marked a\r\ncomplete revolution in my idea of the earlier crimes, and of the\r\ncriminal.\r\n\r\nTwo things influenced my change of mental attitude.  The attack on\r\nBurns was one.  I did not believe that Turner had strength enough to\r\nfell so vigorous a man, even with the capstan bar which we found lying\r\nnear by.  Nor could he have jerked and broken the amberline. Mrs. Johns\r\nI eliminated for the same reason, of course.  I could imagine her\r\ngetting the key by subtlety, wheedling the impressionable young sailor\r\ninto compliance.  But force!\r\n\r\nThe second reason was the stronger.\r\n\r\nSingleton, the mate, had become a tractable and almost amiable\r\nprisoner.  Like Turner, he was ugly only when he was drinking, and\r\nthere was not even enough liquor on the Ella to revive poor Burns. He\r\nspent his days devising, with bits of wire, a ring puzzle that he\r\nintended should make his fortune.  And I believe he contrived, finally,\r\na clever enough bit of foolery.  He was anxious to talk, and complained\r\nbitterly of loneliness, using every excuse to hold Tom, the cook, when\r\nhe carried him his meals.  He had asked for a Bible, too, and read it\r\nnow and then.\r\n\r\nThe morning of Burns's injury, I visited Singleton.\r\n\r\nThe new outrage, coming at a time when they were slowly recovering\r\nconfidence, had turned the men surly.  The loss of the axe, the handle\r\nof which I had told them would, under skillful eyes, reveal the\r\nmurderer as accurately as a photograph, was a serious blow. Again arose\r\nthe specter of the innocent suffering for the guilty. They went\r\ndoggedly about their work, and wherever they gathered there was\r\nmuttered talk of the white figure.  There was grumbling, too, over\r\ntheir lack of weapons for defense.\r\n\r\nThe cook was a ringleader of the malcontents.  Certain utensils were\r\nallowed him; but he was compelled at night to lock them in the galley,\r\nafter either Burns's inspection or mine, and to turn over the key to\r\none of us.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after the attack, therefore, Tom, carrying Singleton's\r\nbreakfast to him, told him at length what had occurred in the night,\r\nand dilated on his lack of self-defense should an attack be directed\r\ntoward him.\r\n\r\nSingleton promptly offered to make him, out of wire, a key to the\r\ngalley door, so that he could get what he wanted from it.  The cook was\r\nto take an impression of the lock.  In exchange, Tom was to fetch him,\r\nfrom a hiding place which Singleton designated in the forward house, a\r\nbottle of whiskey.\r\n\r\nThe cook was a shrewd mulatto, and he let Singleton make the key. It\r\nwas after ten that morning when he brought it to me.  I was trying to\r\nget the details of his injury from Burns, at the time, in the tent.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't see or hear anything, Leslie,\"  Burns said feebly.  \"I don't\r\neven remember being hit.  I felt there was some one behind me. That was\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"There had been nothing suspicious earlier in the night?\"\r\n\r\nHe lay thinking.  He was still somewhat confused.\r\n\r\n\"No--I think not.  Or--yes, I thought once I saw some one standing by\r\nthe mainmast--behind it.  It wasn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long was Mrs. Johns on deck?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she ask you to do something for her?\"\r\n\r\nPale as he was, he colored; but he eyed me honestly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  Don't ask me any more, Leslie.  It had nothing to do with this.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did she ask you to do?\" I persisted remorselessly.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to talk; my head aches.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well.  Then I'll tell you what happened after I went off watch.\r\nNo, I wasn't spying.  I know the woman, that's all.  She said you\r\nlooked tired, and wouldn't it be all right if you sat down for a moment\r\nand talked to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; she said she was nervous.\"\r\n\r\n\"The same thing--only better.  Then she persisted in talking of the\r\ncrime, and finally she said she would like to see the axe.  It wouldn't\r\ndo any harm.  She, wouldn't touch it.\"\r\n\r\nHe watched me uneasily.\r\n\r\n\"She didn't either,\" he said.  \"I'll swear to that, Leslie.  She didn't\r\ngo near the bunk.  She covered her face with her hands, and leaned\r\nagainst the door.  I thought she was going to faint.\"\r\n\r\n\"Against the door, of course!  And got an impression of the key. The\r\ndoor opens in.  She could take out the key, press it against a cake of\r\nwax or even a cake of soap in her hand, and slip it back into the lock\r\nagain while you--What were you doing while she was doing all that?\"\r\n\r\n\"She dropped her salts.  I picked them up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly!  Well, the axe is gone.\"\r\n\r\nHe started up on his elbow.\r\n\r\n\"Gone!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thrown overboard, probably.  It is not in the cabin.\"\r\n\r\nIt was brutal, perhaps; but the situation was all of that.  As Burns\r\nfell back, colorless, Tom, the cook, brought into the tent the wire key\r\nthat Singleton had made.\r\n\r\nThat morning I took from inside of Singleton's mattress a bunch of\r\nkeys, a long steel file, and the leg of one of his chairs, carefully\r\nunscrewed and wrapped at the end with wire a formidable club.  One of\r\nthe keys opened Singleton's door.\r\n\r\nThat was on Saturday.  Early Monday morning we sighted land.\r\n\nWe picked up a pilot outside the Lewes breakwater a man of few words. I\r\ntold him only the outlines of our story, and I believe he half\r\ndiscredited me at first.  God knows, I was not a creditable object.\r\nWhen I took him aft and showed him the jolly-boat, he realized, at\r\nlast, that he was face to face with a great tragedy, and paid it the\r\ntribute of throwing away his cigar.\r\n\r\nHe suggested our raising the yellow plague flag; and this we did, with\r\na ready response from the quarantine officer.  The quarantine officer\r\ncame out in a power-boat, and mounted the ladder; and from that moment\r\nmy command of the Ella ceased.  Turner, immaculately dressed, pale,\r\ndistinguished, member of the yacht club and partner in the Turner line,\r\nmet him at the rail, and conducted him, with a sort of chastened\r\naffability, to the cabin.\r\n\r\nExhausted from lack of sleep, terrified with what had gone by and what\r\nwas yet to come, unshaven and unkempt, the men gathered on the\r\nforecastle-head and waited.\r\n\r\nThe conference below lasted perhaps an hour.  At the end of that time\r\nthe quarantine officer came up and shouted a direction from below, as a\r\nresult of which the jolly-boat was cut loose, and, towed by the tug,\r\ntaken to the quarantine station.  There was an argument, I believe,\r\nbetween Turner and the officer, as to allowing us to proceed up the\r\nriver without waiting for the police.  Turner prevailed, however, and,\r\nfrom the time we hoisted the yellow flag, we were on our way to the\r\ncity, a tug panting beside us, urging the broad and comfortable lines\r\nof the old cargo boat to a semblance of speed.\r\n\r\nThe quarantine officer, a dapper little man, remained on the boat, and\r\nbusied himself officiously, getting the names of the men, peering at\r\nSingleton through his barred window, and expressing disappointment at\r\nmy lack of foresight in having the bloodstains cleared away.\r\n\r\n\"Every stain is a clue, my man, to the trained eye,\" he chirruped.\r\n\"With an axe, too!  What a brutal method!  Brutal!  Where is the axe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone,\" I said patiently.  \"It was stolen out of the captain's cabin.\"\r\n\r\nHe eyed me over his glasses.\r\n\r\n\"That's very strange,\" he commented.  \"No stains, no axe!  You fellows\r\nhave been mighty careful to destroy the evidence, haven't you?\"\r\n\r\nAll that long day we made our deliberate progress up the river. The\r\nluggage from the after house was carried up on deck by Adams and\r\nClarke, and stood waiting for the customhouse.\r\n\r\nTurner, his hands behind him, paced the deck hour by hour, his heavy\r\nface colorless.  His wife, dark, repressed, with a look of being always\r\non guard, watched him furtively.  Mrs. Johns, dressed in black, talked\r\nto the doctor; and, from the notes he made, I knew she was telling the\r\nstory of the tragedy.  And here, there, and everywhere, efficient,\r\nnormal, and so lovely that it hurt me to look at her, was Elsa.\r\nWilliams, the butler, had emerged from his chrysalis of fright, and was\r\nostentatiously looking after the family's comfort.  No clearer\r\nindication could have been given of the new status of affairs than his\r\nchanged attitude toward me.  He came up to me, early in the afternoon,\r\nand demanded that I wash down the deck before the women came up.\r\n\r\nI smiled down at him cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"Williams,\" I said, \"you are a coward--a mean, white-livered coward.\r\nYou have skulked in the after house, behind women, when there was man's\r\nwork to do.  If I wash that deck, it will be with you as a mop.\"\r\n\r\nHe blustered something about speaking to Mr. Turner and seeing that I\r\ndid the work I was brought on board to do, and, seeing Turner's eye on\r\nus, finished his speech with an ugly epithet.  My nerves were strained\r\nto the utmost: lack of sleep and food had done their work. I was no\r\nlonger in command of the Ella; I was a common sailor, ready to vent my\r\nspleen through my fists.\r\n\r\nI knocked him down with my open hand.\r\n\r\nIt was a barbarous and a reckless thing to do.  He picked himself up\r\nand limped away, muttering.  Turner had watched the scene with his cold\r\nblue eyes, and the little doctor with his near-sighted ones.\r\n\r\n\"A dangerous man, that!\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Dangerous and intelligent,\" replied Turner.  \"A bad combination!\"\r\n\r\nIt was late that night when the Ella anchored in the river at\r\nPhiladelphia.  We were not allowed to land.  The police took charge of\r\nship, crew, and passengers.  The men slept heavily on deck, except\r\nBurns, who developed a slight fever from his injury, and moved about\r\nrestlessly.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that the vigilance of the officers was exerted largely\r\nto prevent an escape from the vessel, and not sufficiently for the\r\nsafety of those on board.  I spoke of this, and a guard was placed at\r\nthe companionway again.  Thus I saw Elsa Lee for the last time until\r\nthe trial.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed, as she had been in the afternoon, in a dark cloth suit\r\nof some sort, and I did not see her until I had spoken to the officer\r\nin charge.  She turned, at my voice, and called me to join her where\r\nshe stood.\r\n\r\n\"We are back again, Leslie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss Lee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Back to--what?  To live the whole thing over again in a courtroom! If\r\nonly we could go away, anywhere, and try to forget!\"\r\n\r\nShe had not expected any answer, and I had none ready.  I was\r\nthinking--Heaven help me--that there were things I would not forget if\r\nI could: the lift of her lashes as she looked, up at me; the few words\r\nwe had had together, the day she had told me the deck was not clean;\r\nthe night I had touched her hand with my lips.\r\n\r\n\"We are to be released, I believe,\" she said, \"on our own--some legal\r\nterm; I forget it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Recognizance, probably.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  You do not know law as well as medicine?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry--no; and I know very little medicine.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you sewed up a wound!\"\r\n\r\n\"As a matter of fact,\" I admitted, \"that was my initial performance,\r\nand it is badly done.  It--it puckers.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned on me a trifle impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you make such a secret of your identity?\" she demanded. \"Is it\r\na pose? Or--have you a reason for concealing it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not a pose; and I have nothing to be ashamed of, unless\r\npoverty--\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not.  What do you mean by poverty?\"\r\n\r\n\"The common garden variety sort.  I have hardly a dollar in the world.\r\nAs to my identity,--if it interests you at all, I graduated in medicine\r\nlast June.  I spent the last of the money that was to educate me in\r\npurchasing a dress suit to graduate in, and a supper by way of\r\ncelebration.  The dress suit helped me to my diploma.  The supper gave\r\nme typhoid.\"\r\n\r\n\"So that was it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not jail, you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what are you going to do now?\"\r\n\r\nI glanced around to where a police officer stood behind us watchfully.\r\n\r\n\"Now?  Why, now I go to jail in earnest.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been very good to us,\" she said wistfully.  \"We have all been\r\nstrained and nervous.  Maybe you have not thought I noticed or--or\r\nappreciated what you were doing; but I have, always.  You have given\r\nall of yourself for us.  You have not slept or eaten.  And now you are\r\ngoing to be imprisoned.  It isn't just!\"\r\n\r\nI tried to speak lightly, to reassure her.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be unhappy about that,\" I said.  \"A nice, safe jail, where one\r\nmay sleep and eat, and eat and sleep--oh, I shall be very comfortable!\r\nAnd if you wish to make me exceedingly happy, you will see that they\r\nlet me have a razor.\"\r\n\r\nBut, to my surprise, she buried her face in her arms.  I could not\r\nbelieve at first that she was crying.  The policeman had wandered\r\nacross to the other rail, and stood looking out at the city lights, his\r\nback to us.  I put my hand out to touch her soft hair, then drew it\r\nback.  I could not take advantage of her sympathy, of the hysterical\r\nexcitement of that last night on the Ella.  I put my hands in my\r\npockets, and held them there, clenched, lest, in spite of my will, I\r\nreach out to take her in my arms.\r\n\nAnd now I come, with some hesitation, to the trial.  Hesitation,\r\nbecause I relied on McWhirter to keep a record.  And McWhirter, from\r\nhis notes, appears to have been carried away at times by excitement,\r\nand either jotted down rows of unintelligible words, or waited until\r\nevening and made up his notes, like a woman's expense account, from a\r\nmemory never noticeable for accuracy.\r\n\r\nAt dawn, the morning after we anchored, Charlie Jones roused me,\r\ngrinning.\r\n\r\n\"Friend of yours over the rail, Leslie,\" he said.  \"Wants to take you\r\nashore!\"\r\n\r\nI knew no one in Philadelphia except the chap who had taken me yachting\r\nonce, and I felt pretty certain that he would not associate Leslie the\r\nfootball player with Leslie the sailor on the Ella.  I went reluctantly\r\nto the rail, and looked down.  Below me, just visible in the river mist\r\nof the early morning, was a small boat from which two men were looking\r\nup.  One was McWhirter!\r\n\r\n\"Hello, old top,\" he cried.   \"Or is it you behind that beard?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's I, all right, Mac,\" I said, somewhat huskily.  What with seeing\r\nhim again, his kindly face behind its glasses, the cheerful faith in me\r\nwhich was his contribution to our friendship,--even the way he shook\r\nhis own hand in default of mine,--my throat tightened.  Here, after\r\nall, was home and a friend.\r\n\r\nHe looked up at the rail, and motioned to a rope that hung there.\r\n\r\n\"Get your stuff and come with us for breakfast,\" he said.  \"You look as\r\nif you hadn't eaten since you left.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I can't, Mac.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're not going to hold you, are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"For a day or so, yes.\"\r\n\r\nMac's reply to this was a violent resume of the ancestry and present\r\nlost condition of the Philadelphia police, ending with a request that I\r\njump over, and let them go to the place he had just designated as their\r\nabiding-place in eternity.  On an officer lounging to the rail and\r\nlooking down, however, he subsided into a low muttering.\r\n\r\nThe story of how McWhirter happened to be floating on the bosom of the\r\nDelaware River before five o'clock in the morning was a long one--it\r\nwas months before I got it in full.  Briefly, going home from the\r\ntheater in New York the night before, he had bought an \"extra\" which\r\nhad contained a brief account of the Ella's return.  He seems to have\r\ngone into a frenzy of excitement at once.  He borrowed a small\r\ncar,--one scornfully designated as a \"road louse,\"--and assembled in\r\nit, in wild confusion, one suit of clothes for me, his own and much too\r\nsmall, one hypodermic case, an armful of newspapers with red\r\nscare-heads, a bottle of brandy, a bottle of digitalis, one police\r\ncard, and one excited young lawyer, of the same vintage in law that Mac\r\nand I were in medicine.  At the last moment, fearful that the police\r\nmight not know who I was, he had flung in a scrapbook in which he had\r\npasted--with a glue that was to make his fortune--records of my\r\nexploits on the football field!\r\n\r\nA dozen miles from Philadelphia the little machine had turned over on a\r\ncurve, knocking all the law and most of the enthusiasm out of Walters,\r\nthe legal gentleman, and smashing the brandy-bottle. McWhirter had\r\npicked himself up, kicked viciously at the car, and, gathering up his\r\nimpedimenta, had made the rest of the journey by foot and street-car.\r\n\r\nHis wrath at finding me a prisoner was unbounded; his scorn at Walters,\r\nthe attorney, for not confounding the police with law enough to free\r\nme, was furious and contemptuous.  He picked up the oars in sullen\r\nsilence, and, leaning on them, called a loud and defiant farewell for\r\nthe benefit of the officer.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he said.  \"An hour or so won't make much difference. But\r\nyou'll be free today, all right, all right.  And don't let them bluff\r\nyou, boy.  If the police get funny, tackle them and throw 'em\r\noverboard, one by one.  You can do it.\"\r\n\r\nHe made an insulting gesture at the police, picked up his oars, and\r\nrowed away into the mist.\r\n\r\nBut I was not free, that day, nor for many days.  As I had expected,\r\nTurner, his family, Mrs. Johns, and the stewardess were released, after\r\nexamination.  The rest of us were taken to jail.  Singleton as a\r\nsuspect, the others to make sure of their presence at the trial.\r\n\r\nThe murders took place on the morning of August 12.  The Grand jury met\r\nlate in September, and found an indictment against Singleton. The trial\r\nbegan on the 16th of November.\r\n\r\nThe confinement was terrible.  Accustomed to regular exercise as I was,\r\nI suffered mentally and physically.  I heard nothing from Elsa Lee, and\r\nI missed McWhirter, who had got his hospital appointment, and who wrote\r\nme cheering letters on pages torn from order-books or on\r\nprescription-blanks.  He was in Boston.\r\n\r\nHe got leave of absence for the trial, and, as I explained, the\r\nfollowing notes are his, not mine.  The case was tried in the United\r\nStates Court, before Circuit Judge Willard and District Judge McDowell.\r\nThe United States was represented by a district attorney and two\r\nassistant attorneys.  Singleton had retained a lawyer named Goldstein,\r\na clever young Jew.\r\n\r\nI was called first, as having found the bodies.\r\n\r\n\"Your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ralph Leslie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your age?\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-four.\"\r\n\r\n\"When and where were you born?\"\r\n\r\n\"November 18, 1887, in Columbus, Ohio.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did you ship on the yacht Ella?\"\r\n\r\n\"On July 27.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did she sail?\"\r\n\r\n\"July 28.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you a sailor by occupation?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I am a graduate of a medical college.\"\r\n\r\n\"What were your duties on the ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"They were not well defined.  I had been ill and was not strong. I was\r\na sort of deck steward, I suppose.  I also served a few meals in the\r\ncabin of the after house, when the butler was incapacitated.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where were you quartered?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the forecastle, with the crew, until a day or so before the\r\nmurders.  Then I moved into the after house, and slept in a storeroom\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you make the change?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Johns, a guest, asked me to do so.  She said she was nervous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who slept in the after house?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Turner, Miss Lee, Mrs. Johns, and Mr. Vail.  The\r\nstewardess, Mrs. Sloane, and Karen Hansen, a maid, also slept there;\r\nbut their room opened from the chartroom.\"\r\n\r\nA diagram of the after house was here submitted to the jury.  For the\r\nbenefit of the reader, I reproduce it roughly.  I have made no attempt\r\nto do more than to indicate the relative positions of rooms and\r\ncompanionways.\r\n\r\n                                _____\r\n                       Forward |_____|Compartment\r\n    ___________________________|_____|______________________________\r\n    \\ bath  \\                  |_____|                    /        /\r\n     \\___ ___\\                 |_____|                   /Turner's/\r\n  Mrs.\\       \\                                         /room_ __/\r\n John's\\                                               /____/   /\r\n  room  \\       \\             Main  Cabin             /    /   /\r\n         \\___ ___\\                                   /    /_ _/bath\r\n    Mrs.  \\       \\                                 / Vail's /room\r\n  Turner's \\___    \\                               /________/\r\n     room   \\  \\                                  /  ______/linen\r\n             \\  \\____\\                           /__/store/\r\n        bath  \\  \\    \\                         /__ room /\r\n               \\  \\    \\                       /___/____/\r\n                \\__\\                          /general /\r\n         Miss    \\       \\                   /supplies/\r\n           Lee's  \\       \\                 /________/\r\n             room  \\_______\\______    _____/________/butler's\r\n                    \\_maid's\\  Chart Room          / pantry\r\n                     \\\\ room    used as library   /\r\n               bunk---\\\\ ___  \\ and lounge____   /\r\n                       \\_\\__\\__\\_________|____|_/\r\n                          bunk    (wheel)|____|\r\n\r\n\r\n\"State what happened on the night of August 11 and early morning of\r\nAugust 12.\"\r\n\r\n\"I slept in the storeroom in the after house.  As it was very hot, I\r\nalways left the door open.  The storeroom itself was a small room,\r\nlined with shelves, and reached by a passageway.  The door was at the\r\nend of the passage.  I wakened because of the heat, and found the door\r\nlocked on the outside.  I lit a match, and found I could unscrew the\r\nlock with my knife.  I thought I had been locked in as a joke by the\r\ncrew.  While I was kneeling, some one passed outside the door.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you know that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I felt a board rise under my knee as if the other end had been trod\r\non.  Shortly after, a woman screamed, and I burst open the door.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long after you felt the board rise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps a minute, possibly two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just after, the ship's bell struck six--three o'clock.  The main cabin\r\nwas dark.  There was a light in the chart-room, from the binnacle\r\nlight.  I felt my way to Mr. Vail's room.  I heard him breathing.  His\r\ndoor was open.  I struck a match and looked at him. He had stopped\r\nbreathing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was the state of his bunk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Disordered--horrible.  He was almost hacked to pieces.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ran back and got my revolver.  I thought there had been a mutiny-\"\r\n\r\n\"Confine yourself to what you saw and did.  The court is not interested\r\nin what you thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am only trying to explain what I did.  I ran back to the storeroom\r\nand got my revolver, and ran back through the chart-room to the after\r\ncompanion, which had a hood.  I thought that if any one was lying in\r\nambush, the hood would protect me until I could get to the deck.  I\r\ntold the helmsman what had happened, and ran forward.  Mr. Singleton\r\nwas on the forecastle-head.  We went below together, and found the\r\ncaptain lying at the foot of the forward companion, also dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"At this time, had you called the owner of the ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.  I called him then.  But I could not rouse him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Explain what you mean by that.\"\r\n\r\n\"He had been drinking.\"\r\n\r\nThere followed a furious wrangle over this point; but the prosecuting\r\nattorney succeeded in having question and answer stand.\r\n\r\n\"What did you do next?\"\r\n\r\n\"The mate had called the crew.  I wakened Mrs. Turner, Miss Lee, and\r\nMrs. Johns, and then went to the chart-room to call the women there.\r\nThe door was open an inch or so.  I received no answer to my knock, and\r\npulled it open.  Karen Hansen, the maid, was dead on the floor, and the\r\nstewardess was in her bunk, in a state of collapse.\"\r\n\r\n\"State where you found the axe with which the crimes were committed.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was found in the stewardess's bunk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is this axe now?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was stolen from the captain's cabin, where it was locked for safe\r\nkeeping, and presumably thrown overboard.  At least, we didn't find it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see you are consulting a book to refresh your memory.  What is this\r\nbook?\"\r\n\r\n\"The ship's log.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does it happen to be in your possession?\"\r\n\r\n\"The crew appointed me captain.  As such, I kept the log-book.  It\r\ncontains a full account of the discovery of the bodies, witnessed by\r\nall the men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it in your writing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; it is in my writing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You read it to the men, and they signed it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; they read it themselves before they signed it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a wrangle as to my having authority to make a record in the\r\nlog-book, the prosecuting attorney succeeded in having the book\r\nadmitted as evidence, and read to the jury the entry of August 13.\r\n\r\nHaving thus proved the crimes, I was excused, to be recalled later. The\r\ndefense reserving its cross-examination, the doctor from the quarantine\r\nstation was called next, and testified to the manner of death.  His\r\ntestimony was revolting, and bears in no way on the story, save in one\r\nparticular--a curious uniformity in the mutilation of the bodies of\r\nVail and Captain Richardson--a sinister similarity that was infinitely\r\nshocking.  In each case the forehead, the two arms, and the abdomen had\r\nreceived a frightful blow.  In the case of the Danish girl there was\r\nonly one wound--the injury on the head.\r\n\nHENRIETTA SLOANE was called next.\r\n\r\n\"Your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Henrietta Sloane.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you married?\"\r\n\r\n\"A widow.\"\r\n\r\n\"When and where were you born?\"\r\n\r\n\"Isle of Man, December 11 1872.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long have you lived in the United States?\"\r\n\r\n\"Since I was two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your position on the yacht Ella?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stewardess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before that?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the Baltic, between Liverpool and New York.  That was how I met\r\nMrs. Turner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where was your room on the yacht Ella?\"\r\n\r\n\"Off the chartroom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you indicate it on this diagram?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was there.\" (Pointing.)\r\n\r\nThe diagram was shown to the jury.\r\n\r\n\"There are two bunks in this room.  Which was yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"The one at the side--the one opposite the door was Karen's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell what happened on the night of August 11 and morning of the 12th.\"\r\n\r\n\"I went to bed early.  Karen Hansen had not come down by midnight. When\r\nI opened the door, I saw why.  Mr. Turner and Mr. Singleton were there,\r\ndrinking.\"\r\n\r\nThe defense objected to this but was overruled by the court.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Vail was trying to persuade the mate to go on deck, before the\r\ncaptain came down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did they go?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"What comment did Mr. Singleton make?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said he hoped the captain would come.  He wanted a chance to get at\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened after that?\"\r\n\r\n\"The captain came down and ordered the mate on deck.  Mr. Vail and the\r\ncaptain got Mr. Turner to his room.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I opened my door.\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Karen came down at 12.30.  We went to bed.  At ten minutes to three\r\nthe bell rang for Karen.  She got up and put on a wrapper and slippers.\r\nShe was grumbling and I told her to put out the light and let me sleep.\r\nAs she opened the door she screamed and fell back on the floor.\r\nSomething struck me on the shoulder, and I fainted.  I learned later it\r\nwas the axe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear any sound outside, before you opened the door?\"\r\n\r\n\"A curious chopping sound.  I spoke of it to her.  It came from the\r\nchart-room.\"\r\n\r\n\"When the girl fell back into the room, did you see any one beyond her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw something--I couldn't say just what.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was what you saw a figure?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I am not certain.  It was light--almost white.\" \"Can you not\r\ndescribe it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid not--except that it seemed white.\"\r\n\r\n\"How tall was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't say.\"\r\n\r\n\"As tall as the girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just about, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Think of something that it resembled.  This is important, Mrs. Sloane.\r\nYou must make an effort.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it looked most like a fountain.\"\r\n\r\nEven the jury laughed at this, and yet, after all, Mrs. Sloane was\r\nright--or nearly so!\r\n\r\n\"That is curious.  How did it resemble a fountain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I should have said a fountain in moonlight white, and misty,\r\nand--and flowing.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet, this curious-shaped object threw the axe at you, didn't it?\"\r\n\r\nThere was an objection to the form of this question, but the court\r\noverruled it.\r\n\r\n\"I did not say it threw the axe.  I did not see it thrown.  I felt it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you know the first mate, Singleton, before you met on the Ella?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"We were on the same vessel two years ago, the American, for Bermuda.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes\"--very low.\r\n\r\n\"Were you engaged to marry him at one time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you break it off?\"\r\n\r\n\"We differed about a good many things.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a long battle, the prosecuting attorney was allowed to show that,\r\nfollowing the breaking off of her relations with Singleton, she had\r\nbeen a witness against him in an assault-and-battery case, and had\r\ntestified to his violence of temper.  The dispute took so long that\r\nthere was only time for her cross-examination.  The effect of the\r\nevidence, so far, was distinctly bad for Singleton.\r\n\r\nHis attorney, a young and intelligent Jew, cross-examined Mrs. Sloane.\r\n\r\nAttorney for the defense: \"Did you ever write a letter to the\r\ndefendant, Mrs. Sloane, threatening him if he did not marry you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not recall such a letter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this letter in your writing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so.  Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Sloane, you testify that you opened your door and saw Mr. Vail\r\nand the captain taking Mr. Turner to his room.  Is this correct?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did they take him? I mean, was he not able, apparently, to walk\r\nalone?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was able to walk.  They walked beside him.\"\r\n\r\n\"In your testimony, taken at the time and entered in the ship's log,\r\nyou say you 'judged by the sounds.'  Here you say you 'opened the door\r\nand saw them.' Which is correct?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw them.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say that Mr. Singleton said he wished to 'get at' the captain. Are\r\nthose his exact words?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not recall his exact words.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I can refresh your mind.  With the permission of the court, I\r\nshall read from the ship's log this woman's statement, recorded by the\r\nman who was in charge of the vessel, and therefore competent to make\r\nsuch record, and signed by the witness as having been read and approved\r\nby her:--\r\n\r\n\"'Mr. Singleton said that he hoped the captain would come, as he and\r\nMr. Turner only wanted a chance to get at him....  There was a\r\nsound outside, and Karen thought it was Mr. Turner falling over\r\nsomething, and said that she hoped she would not meet him.  Once or\r\ntwice, when he had been drinking, he had made overtures to her, and she\r\ndetested him....  She opened the door and came back into the room,\r\ntouching me on the arm.  \"That beast is out there,\" she said, \"sitting\r\non the companion steps.  If he tries to stop me, I'll call you.\"'\"\r\n\r\nThe reading made a profound impression.  The prosecution, having\r\nsucceeded in having the log admitted as evidence, had put a trump card\r\nin the hands of the defense.\r\n\r\n\"What were the relations between Mr. Turner and the captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what you mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were they friendly?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--not very.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you overhear, on the night of August 9, a conversation between Mr.\r\nTurner and Mr. Vail?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was its nature?\"\r\n\r\n\"They were quarreling.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did Williams, the butler, give you to hide, that night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Turner's revolver.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he say when he gave it to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He--said to throw it overboard or there would be trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Sloane, do you recognize these two garments?\"\r\n\r\nHe held up a man's dinner shirt and a white waistcoat.  The stewardess,\r\nwho had been calm enough, started and paled.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell without examining them.\" (They were given to her, and\r\nshe looked at them.) \"Yes, I have seen them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"A shirt and waistcoat of Mr. Turner's.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did you see them last?\"\r\n\r\n\"I packed them in my trunk when we left the boat.  They had been\r\nforgotten when the other trunks were packed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had you washed them?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were they washed on shipboard?\"\r\n\r\n\"They look like it.  They have not been ironed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who gave them to you to pack in your trunk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Johns.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do with them on reaching New York?\"\r\n\r\n\"I left them in my trunk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you not return them to Mr. Turner?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was ill, and forgot.  I'd like to know what right you have going\r\nthrough a person's things--and taking what you want!\"\r\n\r\nThe stewardess was excused, the defense having scored perceptibly. It\r\nwas clear what line the young Jew intended to follow.\r\n\r\nOleson, the Swede, was called next, and after the usual formalities:--\r\n\r\n\"Where were you between midnight and 4 A.M. on the morning of August\r\n12?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the crow's-nest of the Ella.\"\r\n\r\n\"State what you saw between midnight and one o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw Mate Singleton walking on the forecastle-head.  Every now and\r\nthen he went to the rail.  He seemed to be vomiting.  It was too dark\r\nto see much.  Then he went aft along the port side of the house, and\r\ncame forward again on the starboard side.  He went to where the axe was\r\nkept.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Near the starboard corner of the forward house.  All the Turner boats\r\nhave an emergency box, with an axe and other tools, in easy reach.  The\r\nofficer on watch carried the key.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could you see what he was doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but he was fumbling at the box.  I heard him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did he go after that?\"\r\n\r\n\"He went aft.\"\r\n\r\n\"You could not see him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't look.  I thought I saw something white moving below me, and I\r\nwas watching it.\"\r\n\r\n\"This white thing--what did it look like?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like a dog, I should say. It moved about, and then disappeared.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Over the rail?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh--no, sir.  It faded away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had you ever heard talk among the men of the Ella being a haunted\r\nship?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--but not until after I'd signed on her!\"\r\n\r\n\"Was there some talk of this 'white thing'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before the murders?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; not till after.  I guess I saw it first.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did the men say about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"They thought it scared Mr. Schwartz overboard.  The Ella's been\r\nunlucky as to crews.  They call her a 'devil ship.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see Mr. Singleton on deck between two and three o'clock?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe cross-examination was very short:--\r\n\r\n\"What sort of night was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would the first mate, as officer on watch, be supposed to see that the\r\nemergency case you speak of was in order?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did the officer on watch remain on the forecastle-head?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Schwartz did not; Mr. Singleton did, mostly except when he went\r\nback to strike the bells.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could Mr. Singleton have been on deck without you seeing him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if he did not move around or smoke.  I could see his pipe\r\nlighted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see his pipe that night?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you were sick, would you be likely to smoke?\"\r\n\r\nThis question, I believe, was ruled out.\r\n\r\n\"In case the wheel of the vessel were lashed for a short time, what\r\nwould happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Depends on the weather.  She'd be likely to come to or fall off\r\nconsiderable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would the lookout know it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"The sails would show it, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThat closed the proceedings for the day.  The crowd seemed reluctant to\r\ndisperse.  Turner's lawyers were in troubled consultation with him.\r\nSingleton was markedly more cheerful, and I thought the prosecution\r\nlooked perturbed and uneasy.  I went back to jail that night, and\r\ndreamed of Elsa--not as I had seen her that day, bending forward,\r\nwatching every point of the evidence, but as I had seen her so often on\r\nthe yacht, facing into the salt breeze as if she loved it, her hands in\r\nthe pockets of her short white jacket, her hair blowing back from her\r\nforehead in damp, close-curling rings.\r\n\nCharlie Jones was called first, on the second day of the trial.  He\r\ngave his place of birth as Pennsylvania, and his present shore address\r\nas a Sailors' Christian Home in New York.  He offered, without\r\nsolicitation, the information that he had been twenty-eight years in\r\nthe Turner service, and could have been \"up at the top,\" but preferred\r\nthe forecastle, so that he could be an influence to the men.\r\n\r\nHis rolling gait, twinkling blue eyes, and huge mustache, as well as\r\nthe plug of tobacco which he sliced with a huge knife, put the crowd in\r\ngood humor, and relieved somewhat the somberness of the proceedings.\r\n\r\n\"Where were you between midnight and 4 A.M. on the morning of August\r\n12?\"\r\n\r\n\"At the wheel.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did not leave the wheel during that time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"When was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"After they found the captain's body.  I went to the forward companion\r\nand looked down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is a helmsman permitted to leave his post?\"\r\n\r\n\"With the captain lying dead down in a pool of blood, I should think-\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind thinking.  Is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do with the wheel when you left it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lashed it.  There are two rope-ends, with loops, to lash it with. When\r\nI was on the Sarah Winters--\"\r\n\r\n\"Stick to the question.  Did you see the mate, Mr. Singleton, during\r\nyour watch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Every half-hour from 12.30 to 1.30.  He struck the bells.  After that\r\nhe said he was sick.  He thought he'd been poisoned.  He said he was\r\ngoing forward to lie down, and for me to strike them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who struck the bell at three o'clock?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did you hear a woman scream?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just before that.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.  It was the Hansen woman.  I didn't like her.  She was a bad\r\nwoman.  When I told her what she was, she laughed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you ever below in the after house?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; not since the boat was fixed up.\"\r\n\r\n\"What could you see through the window beside the wheel?\"\r\n\r\n\"It looked into the chart-room.  If the light was on, I could see all\r\nbut the floor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Between the hours of 1 a.m. and 3 a.m., did any one leave or enter the\r\nafter house by the after companion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.  Mr. Singleton went down into the chart-room, and came back\r\nagain in five or ten minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"At what time?\"\r\n\r\n\"At four bells--two o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one else?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; but I saw Mr. Turner--\"\r\n\r\n\"Confine yourself to the question.  What was Mr. Singleton's manner at\r\nthe time you mention?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was excited.  He brought up a bottle of whiskey from the chart-room\r\ntable, and drank what was left in it.  Then he muttered something, and\r\nthrew the empty bottle over the rail.  He said he was still sick.\"\r\n\r\nThe cross-examination confined itself to one detail of Charlie Jones's\r\ntestimony.\r\n\r\n\"Did you, between midnight and 3 A.M., see any one in the chart-room\r\nbesides the mate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--Mr. Turner.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say you cannot see into the chart-room from the wheel at night.\r\nHow did you see him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He turned on the light.  He seemed to be looking for something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was he dressed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you describe what he wore?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.  His coat was off.  He had a white shirt and a white vest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were the shirt and vest similar to these I show you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most of them things look alike to me.  Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe defense had scored again.  But it suffered at the hands of Burns,\r\nthe next witness.  I believe the prosecution had intended to call\r\nTurner at this time; but, after a whispered conference with Turner's\r\nattorneys, they made a change.  Turner, indeed, was in no condition to\r\ngo on the stand.  He was pallid and twitching, and his face was covered\r\nwith sweat.\r\n\r\nBurns corroborated the testimony against Singleton--his surly temper,\r\nhis outbursts of rage, his threats against the captain. And he brought\r\nout a new point: that Jones, the helmsman, had been afraid of Singleton\r\nthat night, and had asked not to be left alone at the wheel.\r\n\r\nDuring this examination the prosecution for the first time made clear\r\ntheir position: that the captain was murdered first; that Vail\r\ninterfered, and, pursued by Singleton, took refuge in his bunk, where\r\nhe was slaughtered; that the murderer, bending to inspect his horrid\r\nwork, had unwittingly touched the bell that roused Karen Hansen, and,\r\ncrouching in the chartroom with the axe, had struck her as she opened\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution questioned Burns about the axe and its disappearance.\r\n\r\n\"Who suggested that the axe be kept in the captain's cabin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Leslie, acting as captain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who had the key?\"\r\n\r\n\"I carried it on a strong line around my neck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whose arrangement was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Leslie's.  He had the key to Mr. Singleton's cabin, and I carried this\r\none.  We divided the responsibility.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever give the key to any one?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did it ever leave you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not until it was taken away.\"\r\n\r\n\"When was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"On Saturday morning, August 22, shortly before dawn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell what happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was knocked down from behind, while I was standing at the port\r\nforward corner of the after house.  The key was taken from me while I\r\nwas unconscious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever see the white object that has been spoken of by the crew?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.  I searched the deck one night when Adams, the lookout,\r\nraised an alarm.  We found nothing except--\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"He threw down a marlinespike at something moving in the bow.  The\r\nspike disappeared.  We couldn't find it, although we could see where it\r\nhad struck the deck.  Afterwards we found a marlinespike hanging over\r\nthe ship's side by a lanyard.  It might have been the one we looked\r\nfor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Explain 'lanyard.\"'\r\n\r\n\"A cord--a sort of rope.\"\r\n\r\n\"It could not have fallen over the side and hung there?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was fastened with a Blackwell hitch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Show us what you mean.\"\r\n\r\nOn cross-examination by Singleton's attorney, Burns was forced to\r\nrelate the incident of the night before his injury--that Mrs. Johns had\r\nasked to see the axe, and he had shown it to her.  He maintained\r\nstoutly that she had not been near the bunk, and that the axe was there\r\nwhen he locked the door.\r\n\r\nAdams, called, testified to seeing a curious, misty-white object on the\r\nforecastle-head.  It had seemed to come over the bow.  The marlinespike\r\nhe threw had had no lanyard.\r\n\r\nMrs. Turner and Miss Lee escaped with a light examination.  Their\r\nevidence amounted to little, and was practically the same.  They had\r\nretired early, and did not rouse until I called them.  They remained in\r\ntheir rooms most of the time after that, and were busy caring for Mr.\r\nTurner, who had been ill.  Mrs. Turner was good enough to say that I\r\nhad made them as safe and as comfortable as possible.\r\n\r\nThe number of witnesses to be examined, and the searching grilling to\r\nwhich most of them were subjected, would have dragged the case to\r\ninterminable length, had it not been for the attitude of the judges,\r\nwho discouraged quibbling and showed a desire to reach the truth with\r\nthe least possible delay.  One of the judges showed the wide and\r\nunbiased attitude of the court by a little speech after an especially\r\nvenomous contest.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"we are attempting to get to a solution of this\r\nthing.  We are trying one man, it is true, but, in a certain sense, we\r\nare trying every member of the crew, every person who was on board the\r\nship the night of the crime.  We have a curious situation.  The\r\nmurderer is before us, either in the prisoner's dock or among the\r\nwitnesses.  Let us get at the truth without bickering.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Johns was called, following Miss Lee.  I watched her carefully on\r\nthe stand.  I had never fathomed Mrs. Johns, or her attitude toward the\r\nrest of the party.  I had thought, at the beginning of the cruise, that\r\nVail and she were incipient lovers.  But she had taken his death with a\r\ncalmness that was close to indifference. There was something strange\r\nand inexplicable in her tigerish championship of Turner--and it remains\r\ninexplicable even now.  I have wondered since--was she in love with\r\nTurner, or was she only a fiery partisan?  I wonder!\r\n\r\nShe testified with an insolent coolness that clearly irritated the\r\nprosecution--thinking over her replies, refusing to recall certain\r\nthings, and eyeing the jury with long, slanting glances that set them,\r\naccording to their type, either wriggling or ogling.\r\n\r\nThe first questions were the usual ones.  Then:\r\n\r\n\"Do you recall the night of the 31st of July?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you be more specific?\"\r\n\r\n\"I refer to the night when Captain Richardson found the prisoner in the\r\nchart-room and ordered him on deck.\"\r\n\r\n\"I recall that, yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where were you during the quarrel?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was behind Mr. Vail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us about it, please.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was an ordinary brawl.  The captain knocked the mate down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear the mate threaten the captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.  He went on deck, muttering; I did not hear what was said.\"\r\n\r\n\"After the crimes, what did you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"We established a dead-line at the foot of the forward companion. The\r\nother was locked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was there a guard at the top of the companion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but we trusted no one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where was Mr. Turner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ill, in his cabin.\"\r\n\r\n\"How ill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very.  He was delirious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you allow any one down?\"\r\n\r\n\"At first, Leslie, a sort of cabin-boy and deck steward, who seemed to\r\nknow something of medicine.  Afterward we would not allow him, either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"We did not trust him.\"\r\n\r\n\"This Leslie--why had you asked him to sleep in the storeroom?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--was afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you explain why you were afraid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear is difficult to explain, isn't it?  If one knows why one is\r\nafraid, one--er--generally isn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a bit subtle, I'm afraid.  You were afraid, then, without\r\nknowing why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had you a revolver on board?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whose revolver was kept on the cabin table?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine.  I always carry one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Always?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then--have you one with you now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you asked the sailor Burns to let you see the axe, what did you\r\ngive as a reason?\"\r\n\r\n\"The truth--curiosity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, having seen the axe, where did you go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Below.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please explain the incident of the two articles Mr. Goldstein showed\r\nto the jury yesterday, the shirt and waistcoat.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was very simple.  Mr. Turner had been very ill.  We took turns in\r\ncaring for him.  I spilled a bowl of broth over the garments that were\r\nshown, and rubbed them out in the bathroom.  They were hung in the\r\ncabin used by Mr. Vail to dry, and I forgot them when we were packing.\"\r\n\r\nThe attorney for the defense cross-examined her:\r\n\r\n\"What color were the stains you speak of?\"\r\n\r\n\"Darkish--red-brown.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of broth did you spill?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's childish, isn't it? I don't recall.\"\r\n\r\n\"You recall its color.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was beef broth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Johns, on the night you visited the forward house and viewed the\r\naxe, did you visit it again?\"\r\n\r\n\"The axe, or the forward house?\"\r\n\r\n\"The house.\"\r\n\r\nShe made one of her long pauses.  Finally:--\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\"\r\n\r\n\"Between three and four o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who went with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I went alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you go beyond the line that was railed off for your safety?\"\r\n\r\n(Sharply.) \"Because I wished to.  I was able to take care of myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you visit the forward house?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was nervous and could not sleep.  I thought no one safe while the\r\naxe was on the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see the body of Burns, the sailor, lying on the deck at that\r\ntime?\"\r\n\r\n\"He might have been there; I did not see him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you saying that you went to the forward house to throw the axe\r\noverboard?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--if I could get in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you know why the axe was being kept?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the murders had been committed with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had you heard of any finger-prints on the handle?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did it occur to you that you were interfering with justice in\r\ndisposing of the axe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean justice or law?  They are not the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us about your visit to the forward house.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was between two and three.  I met no one.  I had a bunch of keys\r\nfrom the trunks and from four doors in the after house.  Miss Lee knew\r\nI intended to try to get rid of the axe.  I did not need my keys.  The\r\ndoor was open---wide open.  I--I went in, and--\"\r\n\r\nHere, for the first time, Mrs. Johns's composure forsook her.  She\r\nturned white, and her maid passed up to her a silver smelling-salts\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\n\"What happened when you went in?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was dark.  I stood just inside.  Then something rushed past me and\r\nout of the door, a something--I don't know what--a woman, I thought at\r\nfirst, in white.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the room was dark, how could you tell it was white?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was a faint light--enough to see that.  There was no noise--just\r\na sort of swishing sound.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I waited a moment, and hurried back to the after house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was the axe gone then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see the axe at that time?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you touch it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have never touched it, at that time or before.\"\r\n\r\nShe could not be shaken in her testimony and was excused.  She had\r\nborne her grilling exceedingly well, and, in spite of her flippancy,\r\nthere was a ring of sincerity about the testimony that gave it weight.\r\n\r\nFollowing her evidence, the testimony of Tom, the cook, made things\r\nlook bad for Singleton, by connecting him with Mrs. Johns's intruder in\r\nthe captain's room.  He told of Singleton's offer to make him a key to\r\nthe galley with wire.  It was clear that Singleton had been a prisoner\r\nin name only, and this damaging statement was given weight when, on my\r\nrecall later, I identified the bunch of keys, the file, and the club\r\nthat I had taken from Singleton's mattress.  It was plain enough that,\r\nwith Singleton able to free himself as he wished, the attack on Burns\r\nand the disappearance of the axe were easily enough accounted for.  It\r\nwould have been possible, also, to account for the white figure that\r\nhad so alarmed the men, on the same hypothesis. Cross-examination of\r\nTom by Mr. Goldstein, Singleton's attorney, brought out one curious\r\nfact.  He had made no dark soup or broth for the after house.  Turner\r\nhad taken nothing during his illness but clam bouillon, made with milk,\r\nand the meals served to the four women had been very light.  \"They\r\nlived on toast and tea, mostly,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThat completed the taking of evidence for the day.  In spite of the\r\nstruggles of the clever young Jew, the weight of testimony was against\r\nSingleton.  But there were curious discrepancies.\r\n\r\nTurner went on the stand the next morning.\r\n\n\"Your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Marshall Benedict Turner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your residence?\"\r\n\r\n\"West 106th Street, New York City.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your occupation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Member of the firm of L. Turner's Sons, shipowners.  In the coast\r\ntrade.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you own the yacht Ella?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you recognize this chart?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  It is the chart of the after house of the Ella.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you show where your room is on the drawing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Mr. Vail's?\"\r\n\r\n\"Next, connecting through a bath-room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where was Mr. Vail's bed on the chart?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, against the storeroom wall.\"\r\n\r\n\"With your knowledge of the ship and its partitions, do you think that\r\na crime could be committed, a crime of the violent nature of this one,\r\nwithout making a great deal of noise and being heard in the storeroom?\"\r\n\r\nViolent opposition developing to this question, it was changed in form\r\nand broken up.  Eventually, Turner answered that the partitions were\r\nheavy and he thought it possible.\r\n\r\n\"Were the connecting doors between your room and Mr. Vail's generally\r\nlocked at night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  Not always.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were they locked on this particular night?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did you see Mr. Vail last?\"\r\n\r\n\"At midnight, or about that.  I--I was not well.  He went with me to my\r\nroom.\"\r\n\r\n\"What were your relations with Mr. Vail?\"\r\n\r\n\"We were old friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear any sound in Mr. Vail's cabin that night?\"\r\n\r\n\"None.  But, as I say, I was--ill.  I might not have noticed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you leave your cabin that night of August 11 or early morning of\r\nthe 12th?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not that I remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"The steersman has testified to seeing you, without your coat, in the\r\nchart-room, at two o'clock.  Were you there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I may have been--I think not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you say you 'may have been--I think not'?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was ill.  The next day I was delirious.  I remember almost nothing\r\nof that time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you know the woman Karen Hansen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only as a maid in my wife's employ.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear the crash when Leslie broke down the door of the\r\nstoreroom?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.  I was in a sort of stupor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you know the prisoner before you employed him on the Ella?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; he had been in our employ several times.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was his reputation--I mean, as a ship's officer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you recall the night of the 31st of July?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please tell what you know about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had asked Mr. Singleton below to have a drink with me.  Captain\r\nRichardson came below and ordered him on deck.  They had words, and he\r\nknocked Singleton down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear the mate threaten to 'get' the captain, then or later?\"\r\n\r\n\"He may have made some such threat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there a bell in your cabin connecting with the maids' cabin off the\r\nchart-room?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.  My bell rang in the room back of the galley, where Williams\r\nslept.  The boat was small, and I left my man at home.  Williams looked\r\nafter me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did the bell from Mr. Vail's room ring?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the maids' room.  Mr. Vail's room was designed for Mrs. Turner.\r\nWhen we asked Mrs. Johns to go with us, Mrs. Turner gave Vail her room.\r\nIt was a question of baths.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ring any bell during the night?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Knowing the relation of the bell above Mr. Vail's berth to the bed\r\nitself, do you think he could have reached it after his injury?\"\r\n\r\n(Slowly.) \"After what the doctor has said, no; he would have had to\r\nraise himself and reach up.\"\r\n\r\nThe cross-examination was brief but to the point:\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by 'ill'?\"\r\n\r\n\"That night I had been somewhat ill; the next day I was in bad shape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you know the woman Karen Hansen before your wife employed her?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"A previous witness has said that the Hansen woman, starting out of her\r\nroom, saw you outside and retreated.  Were you outside the door at any\r\ntime during that night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only before midnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"You said you 'might have been' in the chart-room at two o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have said I was ill.  I might have done almost anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is exactly what we are getting at, Mr. Turner.  Going back to the\r\n30th of July, when you were not ill, did you have any words with the\r\ncaptain?\"\r\n\r\n\"We had a few.  He was exceeding his authority.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you recall what you said?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was indignant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Think again, Mr. Turner.  If you cannot recall, some one else will.\"\r\n\r\n\"I threatened to dismiss him and put the first mate in his place. I was\r\nangry, naturally.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what did the captain reply?\"\r\n\r\n\"He made an absurd threat to put me in irons.\"\r\n\r\n\"What were your relations after that?\"\r\n\r\n\"They were strained.  We simply avoided each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a few more questions, Mr. Turner, and I shall not detain you. Do\r\nyou carry a key to the emergency case in the forward house, the case\r\nthat contained the axe?\"\r\n\r\nLike many of the questions, this was disputed hotly.  It was finally\r\nallowed, and Turner admitted the key.  Similar cases were carried on\r\nall the Turner boats, and he had such a key on his ring.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever see the white object that terrified the crew?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never.  Sailors are particularly liable to such hysteria.\"\r\n\r\n\"During your delirium, did you ever see such a figure?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not recall any details of that part of my illness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you in favor of bringing the bodies back to port?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--yes, certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you recall going on deck the morning after the murders were\r\ndiscovered?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vaguely.\"\r\n\r\n\"What were the men doing at that time?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe--really, I do not like to repeat so often that I was ill\r\nthat day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you any recollection of what you said to the men at that time?\"\r\n\r\n\"None.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me refresh your memory from the ship's log.\"\r\n\r\n(Reading.) \"'Mr. Turner insisted that the bodies be buried at sea, and,\r\non the crew opposing this, retired to his cabin, announcing that he\r\nconsidered the attitude of the men a mutiny.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I recall being angry at the men--not much else.  My position was\r\nrational enough, however.  It was midsummer, and we had a long voyage\r\nbefore us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish to read something else to you.  The witness Leslie testified to\r\nsleeping in the storeroom, at the request of Mrs. Johns\". (reading),\r\n\"'giving as her reason a fear of something going wrong, as there was\r\ntrouble between Mr. Turner and the captain.'\"\r\n\r\nWhatever question Mr. Goldstein had been framing, he was not permitted\r\nto use this part of the record.  The log was admissible only as a\r\nrecord on the spot, made by a competent person and witnessed by all\r\nconcerned, of the actual occurrences on the Ella. My record of Mrs.\r\nJohns's remark was ruled out; Turner was not on trial.\r\n\r\nTurner, pale and shaking, left the stand at two o'clock that day, and I\r\nwas recalled.  My earlier testimony had merely established the finding\r\nof the bodies.  I was now to have a bad two hours.  I was an important\r\nwitness, probably the most important.  I had heard the scream that had\r\nrevealed the tragedy, and had been in the main cabin of the after house\r\nonly a moment or so after the murderer.  I had found the bodies, Vail\r\nstill living, and had been with the accused mate when he saw the\r\ncaptain prostrate at the foot of the forward companion.\r\n\r\nAll of this, aided by skillful questions, I told as exactly as\r\npossible.  I told of the mate's strange manner on finding the bodies; I\r\nrelated, to a breathless quiet, the placing of the bodies in the\r\njolly-boat; and the reading of the burial service over them; I told of\r\nthe little boat that followed us, like some avenging spirit, carrying\r\nby day a small American flag, union down, and at night a white light.\r\nI told of having to increase the length of the towing-line as the heat\r\ngrew greater, and of a fear I had that the rope would separate, or that\r\nthe mysterious hand that was the author of the misfortunes would cut\r\nthe line.\r\n\r\nI told of the long nights without sleep, while, with our few available\r\nmen, we tried to work the Ella back to land; of guarding the after\r\nhouse; of a hundred false alarms that set our nerves quivering and our\r\nhearts leaping.  And I made them feel, I think, the horror of a\r\nsituation where each man suspected his neighbor, feared and loathed\r\nhim, and yet stayed close by him because a known danger is better than\r\nan unknown horror.\r\n\r\nThe record of my examination is particularly faulty, McWhirter having\r\nallowed personal feeling to interfere with accuracy.  Here and there in\r\nthe margins of his notebook I find unflattering allusions to the\r\nprosecuting attorney; and after one question, an impeachment of my\r\nmotives, to which Mac took violent exception, no answer at all is\r\nrecorded, and in a furious scrawl is written: \"The little\r\nwhippersnapper!  Leslie could smash him between his thumb and finger!\"\r\n\r\nI found another curious record--a leaf, torn out of the book, and\r\nevidently designed to be sent to me, but failing its destination, was\r\nas follows: \"For Heaven's sake, don't look at the girl so much! The\r\nnewspaper men are on.\"\r\n\r\nBut, to resume my examination.  The first questions were not of\r\nparticular interest.  Then:\r\n\r\n\"Did the prisoner know you had moved to the after house?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know.  The forecastle hands knew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell what you know of the quarrel on July 31 between Captain\r\nRichardson and the prisoner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw it from a deck window.\"  I described it in detail.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you move to the after house?\"\r\n\r\n\"At the request of Mrs. Johns.  She said she was nervous.\"\r\n\r\n\"What reason did she give?\"\r\n\r\n\"That Mr. Turner was in a dangerous mood; he had quarreled with the\r\ncaptain and was quarreling with Mr. Vail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you know the arrangement of rooms in the after house?  How the\r\npeople slept?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a general way.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew Mr. Vail's room and Miss Lee's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you know where the maids slept?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have testified that you were locked in.  Was the key kept in the\r\nlock?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would whoever locked you in have had only to move the key from one\r\nside of the door to the other?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was the key left in the lock when you were fastened in?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Dr.  Leslie, we want you to tell us what the prisoner did that\r\nnight when you told him what had happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"I called to him to come below, for God's sake.  He seemed dazed and at\r\na loss to know what to do.  I told him to get his revolver and call the\r\ncaptain.  He went into the forward house and got his revolver, but he\r\ndid not call the captain.  We went below and stumbled over the\r\ncaptain's body.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was the mate's condition?\"\r\n\r\n\"When we found the body?\"\r\n\r\n\"His general condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was intoxicated.  He collapsed on the steps when we found the\r\ncaptain.  We both almost collapsed.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was his mental condition?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you mean, was he frightened, we both were.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was he pale?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not notice then.  He was pale and looked ill later, when the\r\ncrew had gathered.\"\r\n\r\n\"About this key: was it ever found? The key to the storeroom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\"\r\n\r\n\"That same morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?  And by whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Lee found it on the floor in Mr. Turner's room.\"\r\n\r\nThe prosecution was totally unprepared for this reply, and proceedings\r\nwere delayed for a moment while the attorneys consulted. On the\r\nresumption of my examination, they made a desperate attempt to impeach\r\nmy character as a witness, trying to show that I had sailed under false\r\npretenses; that I was so feared in the after house that the women\r\nrefused to allow me below, or to administer to Mr. Turner the remedies\r\nI prepared; and, finally, that I had surrendered myself to the crew as\r\na suspect, of my own accord.\r\n\r\nAgainst this the cross-examination threw all its weight.  The\r\nprosecuting attorneys having dropped the question of the key, the\r\nshrewd young lawyer for the defense followed it up:--\r\n\r\n\"This key, Dr.  Leslie, do you know where it is now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I have it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you tell how it came into your possession?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.  I picked it up on the deck, a night or so after the\r\nmurders.  Miss Lee had dropped it.\"  I caught Elsa Lee's eye, and she\r\ngave me a warm glance of gratitude.\r\n\r\n\"Have you the key with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" I produced it.\r\n\r\n\"Are you a football player, Doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought I recalled you.  I have seen you play several times. In\r\nspite of our friend the attorney for the commonwealth, I do not believe\r\nwe will need to call character witnesses for you.  Did you see Miss Lee\r\npick up the key to the storeroom in Mr. Turner's room?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did it occur to you at the time that the key had any significance?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wondered how it got there.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say you listened inside the locked door, and heard no sound, but\r\nfelt a board rise up under your knee.  A moment or two later, when you\r\ncalled the prisoner, he was intoxicated, and reeled.  Do you mean to\r\ntell us that a drunken man could have made his way in the darkness,\r\nthrough a cabin filled with chairs, tables, and a piano, in absolute\r\nsilence?\"\r\n\r\nThe prosecuting attorney was on his feet in an instant, and the\r\nobjection was sustained.  I was next shown the keys, club, and file\r\ntaken from Singleton's mattress.  \"You have identified these objects as\r\nhaving been found concealed in the prisoner's mattress.  Do any of\r\nthese keys fit the captain's cabin?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who saw the prisoner during the days he was locked in his cabin?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw him occasionally.  The cook saw him when he carried him his\r\nmeals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever tell the prisoner where the axe was kept?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did the members of the crew know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe so.  Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was the fact that Burns carried the key to the captain's cabin a\r\nmatter of general knowledge?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.  The crew knew that Burns and I carried the keys; they did not\r\nknow which one each carried, unless--\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on, please.\"\r\n\r\n\"If any one had seen Burns take Mrs. Johns forward and show her the\r\naxe, he would have known.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who were on deck at that time?\"\r\n\r\n\"All the crew were on deck, the forecastle being closed.  In the\r\ncrow's-nest was McNamara; Jones was at the wheel.\"\r\n\r\n\"From the crow's-nest could the lookout have seen Burns and Mrs. Johns\r\ngoing forward?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.  The two houses were connected by an awning.\"\r\n\r\n\"What could the helmsman see?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing forward of the after house.\"\r\n\r\nThe prosecution closed its case with me.  The defense, having virtually\r\nconducted its case by cross-examination of the witnesses already\r\ncalled, contented itself with producing a few character witnesses, and\r\n\"rested.\"  Goldstein made an eloquent plea of \"no case,\" and asked the\r\njudge so to instruct the jury.\r\n\r\nThis was refused, and the case went to the jury on the seventh day--a\r\nsurprisingly short trial, considering the magnitude of the crimes.\r\n\r\nThe jury disagreed.  But, while they wrangled, McWhirter and I were\r\nalready on the right track.  At the very hour that the jurymen were\r\nbeing discharged and steps taken for a retrial, we had the murderer\r\nlocked in my room in a cheap lodging-house off Chestnut Street.\r\n\nWith the submission of the case to the jury, the witnesses were given\r\ntheir freedom.  McWhirter had taken a room for me for a day or two to\r\ngive me time to look about; and, his own leave of absence from his\r\nhospital being for ten days, we had some time together.\r\n\r\nMy situation was better than it had been in the summer.  I had my\r\nstrength again, although the long confinement had told on me.  But my\r\nposition was precarious enough.  I had my pay from the Ella, and\r\nnothing else.  And McWhirter, with a monthly stipend from his hospital\r\nof twenty-five dollars, was not much better off.\r\n\r\nMy first evening of freedom we spent at the theater.  We bought the\r\nbest seats in the house, and we dressed for the occasion--being in the\r\nposition of having nothing to wear between shabby everyday wear and\r\nevening clothes.\r\n\r\n\"It is by way of celebration,\" Mac said, as he put a dab of\r\nshoe-blacking over a hole in his sock; \"you having been restored to\r\nlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  That's the game,\r\nLeslie--the pursuit of happiness.\"\r\n\r\nI was busy with a dress tie that I had washed and dried by pasting it\r\non a mirror, an old trick of mine when funds ran low.  I was trying to\r\nenter into Mac's festive humor, but I had not reacted yet from the\r\nhorrors of the past few months.\r\n\r\n\"Happiness!\" I said scornfully.  \"Do you call this happiness?\"\r\n\r\nHe put up the blacking, and, coming to me, stood eyeing me in the\r\nmirror as I arranged my necktie.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be bitter,\" he said.  \"Happiness was my word.  The Good Man was\r\ngood to you when he made you.  That ought to be a source of\r\nsatisfaction.  And as for the girl--\"\r\n\r\n\"What girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"If she could only see you now.  Why in thunder didn't you take those\r\nclothes on board?  I wanted you to.  Couldn't a captain wear a dress\r\nsuit on special occasions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mac,\" I said gravely, \"if you will think a moment, you will remember\r\nthat the only special occasions on the Ella, after I took charge, were\r\nfunerals.  Have you sat through seven days of horrors without realizing\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\nMac had once gone to Europe on a liner, and, having exhausted his\r\nfunds, returned on a cattle-boat.\r\n\r\n\"All the captains I ever knew,\" he said largely, \"were a fussy\r\nlot--dressed to kill, and navigating the boat from the head of a\r\ndinner-table.  But I suppose you know.  I was only regretting that she\r\nhadn't seen you the way you're looking now.  That's all.  I suppose I\r\nmay regret, without hurting your feelings!\"\r\n\r\nHe dropped all mention of Elsa after that, for a long time.  But I saw\r\nhim looking at me, at intervals, during the evening, and sighing.  He\r\nwas still regretting!\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed the theater, after all, with the pent-up enthusiasm of long\r\nmonths of work and strain.  We laughed at the puerile fun, encored the\r\nprettiest of the girls, and swaggered in the lobby between acts, with\r\ncigarettes.  There we ran across the one man I knew in Philadelphia,\r\nand had supper after the play with three or four fellows who, on\r\nhearing my story, persisted in believing that I had sailed on the Ella\r\nas a lark or to follow a girl.  My simple statement that I had done it\r\nout of necessity met with roars of laughter and finally I let it go at\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nIt was after one when we got back to the lodging-house, being escorted\r\nthere in a racing car by a riotous crowd that stood outside the door,\r\nas I fumbled for my key, and screeched in unison: \"Leslie! Leslie!\r\nLeslie! Sic 'em!\" before they drove away.\r\n\r\nThe light in the dingy lodging-house parlor was burning full, but the\r\nhall was dark.  I stopped inside and lighted a cigarette.\r\n\r\n\"Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, Mac!\" I said.  \"I've got\r\nthe first two, and the other can be had--for the pursuit.\"\r\n\r\nMac did not reply: he was staring into the parlor.  Elsa Lee was\r\nstanding by a table, looking at me.\r\n\r\nShe was very nervous, and tried to explain her presence in a\r\nbreath--with the result that she broke down utterly and had to stop.\r\nMac, his jovial face rather startled, was making for the stairs; but I\r\nsternly brought him back and presented him.  Whereon, being utterly\r\nconfounded, he made the tactful remark that he would have to go and put\r\nout the milk-bottles: it was almost morning!\r\n\r\nShe had been waiting since ten o'clock, she said.  A taxicab, with her\r\nmaid, was at the door.  They were going back to New York in the\r\nmorning, and things were terribly wrong.\r\n\r\n\"Wrong?  You need not mind Mr. McWhirter.  He is as anxious as I am to\r\nbe helpful.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are detectives watching Marshall; we saw one to-day at the\r\nhotel.  If the jury disagrees--and the lawyers think they will--they\r\nwill arrest him.\"\r\n\r\nI thought it probable.  There was nothing I could say.  McWhirter made\r\nan effort to reassure her.\r\n\r\n\"It wouldn't be a hanging matter, anyhow,\" he said.  \"There's a lot\r\nagainst him, but hardly a jury in the country would hang a man for\r\nsomething he did, if he could prove he was delirious the next day.\" She\r\npaled at this dubious comfort, but it struck her sense of humor, too,\r\nfor she threw me a fleeting smile.\r\n\r\n\"I was to ask you to do something,\" she said.  \"None of us can, for we\r\nare being watched.  I was probably followed here.  The Ella is still in\r\nthe river, with only a watchman on board.  We want you to go there\r\nto-night, if you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the Ella?\"\r\n\r\nShe was feeling in her pocketbook, and now she held out to me an\r\nenvelope addressed in a sprawling hand to Mr. Turner at his hotel.\r\n\r\n\"Am I to open it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please.\"\r\n\r\nI unfolded a sheet of ruled note-paper of the most ordinary variety. It\r\nhad been opened and laid flat, and on it, in black ink, was a crude\r\ndrawing of the deck of the Ella, as one would look down on it from\r\naloft.  Here and there were small crosses in red ink, and, overlying it\r\nall from bow to stern, a red axe.  Around the border, not written, but\r\nprinted in childish letters, were the words: \"NOT YET.  HA, HA.\"  In a\r\ncorner was a drawing of a gallows, or what passes in the everyday mind\r\nfor a gallows, and in the opposite corner an open book.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" she said, \"it was mailed downtown late this afternoon. The\r\nhotel got it at seven o'clock.  Marshall wanted to get a detective, but\r\nI thought of you.  I knew--you knew the boat, and then--you had said--\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything in all the world that I can do to help you, I will do,\" I\r\nsaid, looking at her.  And the thing that I could not keep out of my\r\neyes made her drop hers.\r\n\r\n\"Sweet little document!\" said McWhirter, looking over my shoulder.\r\n\"Sent by some one with a nice disposition.  What do the crosses mark?\"\r\n\r\n\"The location of the bodies when found,\" I explained--\"these three.\r\nThis looks like the place where Burns lay unconscious.  That one near\r\nthe rail I don't know about, nor this by the mainmast.\"\r\n\r\n\"We thought they might mark places, clues, perhaps, that had been\r\noverlooked.  The whole--the whole document is a taunt, isn't it? The\r\nscaffold, and the axe, and 'not yet'; a piece of bravado!\"\r\n\r\n\"Right you are,\" said McWhirter admiringly.  \"A little escape of glee\r\nfrom somebody who's laughing too soon.  One-thirty--it will soon be the\r\nproper hour for something to happen on the Ella, won't it?  If that was\r\nsent by some member of the crew--and it looks like it; they are loose\r\nto-day--the quicker we follow it up, the better, if there's anything to\r\nfollow.\"\r\n\r\n\"We thought if you would go early in the morning, before any of them\r\nmake an excuse to go back on board--\"\r\n\r\n\"We will go right away; but, please--don't build too much on this. It's\r\na good possibility, that's all.  Will the watchman let us on board?\"\r\n\r\n\"We thought of that.  Here is a note to him from Marshall, and--will\r\nyou do us one more kindness?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then--if you should find anything, bring it to us; to the police;\r\nlater, if you must, but to us first.\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the morning.  We will not leave until we hear from you.\"\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand, first to McWhirter, then to me.  I kept it a\r\nlittle longer than I should have, perhaps, and she did not take it away.\r\n\r\n\"It is such a comfort,\" she said, \"to have you with us and not against\r\nus!  For Marshall didn't do it, Leslie--I mean--it is hard for me to\r\nthink of you as Dr. Leslie!  He didn't do it.  At first, we thought he\r\nmight have, and he was delirious and could not reassure us.  He swears\r\nhe did not.  I think, just at first, he was afraid he had done it; but\r\nhe did not.  I believe that, and you must.\"\r\n\r\nI believed her--I believed anything she said.  I think that if she had\r\nchosen to say that I had wielded the murderer's axe on the Ella, I\r\nshould have gone to the gallows rather than gainsay her.  From that\r\nnight, I was the devil's advocate, if you like.  I was determined to\r\nsave Marshall Turner.\r\n\r\nShe wished us to take her taxicab, dropping her at her hotel; and,\r\nreckless now of everything but being with her, I would have done so.\r\nBut McWhirter's discreet cough reminded me of the street-car level of\r\nour finances, and I made the excuse of putting on more suitable\r\nclothing.\r\n\r\nI stood in the street, bareheaded, watching her taxicab as it rattled\r\ndown the street.  McWhirter touched me on the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Wake up!\" he said.  \"We have work to do, my friend.\"\r\n\r\nWe went upstairs together, cautiously, not to rouse the house. At the\r\ntop, Mac turned and patted me on the elbow, my shoulder being a foot or\r\nso above him.\r\n\r\n\"Good boy!\" he said.  \"And if that shirtfront and tie didn't knock into\r\neternal oblivion the deck-washing on the Ella, I'll eat them!\"\r\n\nI deserve no credit for the solution of the Ella's mystery.  I have a\r\ncertain quality of force, perhaps, and I am not lacking in physical\r\ncourage; but I have no finesse of intellect.  McWhirter, a foot shorter\r\nthan I, round of face, jovial and stocky, has as much subtlety in his\r\nlittle finger as I have in my six feet and a fraction of body.\r\n\r\nAll the way to the river, therefore, he was poring over the drawing. He\r\nnamed the paper at once.\r\n\r\n\"Ought to know it,\" he said, in reply to my surprise.  \"Sold enough\r\npaper at the drugstore to qualify as a stationery engineer.\"  He\r\nwrithed as was his habit over his jokes, and then fell to work at the\r\ndrawing again.  \"A book,\" he said, \"and an axe, and a gibbet or\r\ngallows.  B-a-g--that makes 'bag.'  Doesn't go far, does it? Humorous\r\nduck, isn't he?  Any one who can write 'ha! ha!' under a gallows has\r\nreal humor.  G-a-b, b-a-g!\"\r\n\r\nThe Ella still lay in the Delaware, half a mile or so from her original\r\nmoorings.  She carried the usual riding-lights--a white one in the bow,\r\nanother at the stern, and the two vertical red lights which showed her\r\nnot under command.  In reply to repeated signals, we were unable to\r\nrouse the watchman.  I had brought an electric flash with me, and by\r\nits aid we found a rope ladder over the side, with a small boat at its\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nAlthough the boat indicated the presence of the watchman on board, we\r\nmade our way to the deck without challenge.  Here McWhirter suggested\r\nthat the situation might be disagreeable, were the man to waken and get\r\nat us with a gun.\r\n\r\nWe stood by the top of the ladder, therefore, and made another effort\r\nto rouse him.  \"Hey, watchman!\" I called.  And McWhirter, in a deep\r\nbass, sang lustily: \"Watchman, what of the night?\"  Neither of us made,\r\nany perceptible impression on the silence and gloom of the Ella.\r\n\r\nMcWhirter grew less gay.  The deserted decks of the ship, her tragic\r\nhistory, her isolation, the darkness, which my small flash seemed only\r\nto intensify, all had their effect on him.\r\n\r\n\"It's got my goat,\" he admitted.  \"It smells like a tomb.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be an ass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Turn the light over the side, and see if we fastened that boat. We\r\ndon't want to be left here indefinitely.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's folly, Mac,\" I said, but I obeyed him.  \"The watchman's boat\r\nis there, so we--\"\r\n\r\nBut he caught me suddenly by the arm and shook me.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" he said.  \"What is that over there?\"\r\n\r\nIt was a moment before my eyes, after the flashlight, could discern\r\nanything in the darkness.  Mac was pointing forward.  When I could see,\r\nMac was ready to laugh at himself.\r\n\r\n\"I told you the place had my goat!\" he said sheepishly.  \"I thought I\r\nsaw something duck around the corner of that building; but I think it\r\nwas a ray from a searchlight on one of those boats.\"\r\n\r\n\"The watchman, probably,\" I said quietly.  But my heart beat a little\r\nfaster.  \"The watchman taking a look at us and gone for his gun.\"\r\n\r\nI thought rapidly.  If Mac had seen anything, I did not believe it was\r\nthe watchman.  But there should be a watchman on board--in the forward\r\nhouse, probably.  I gave Mac my revolver and put the light in my\r\npocket.  I might want both hands that night.  I saw better without the\r\nflash, and, guided partly by the bow light, partly by my knowledge of\r\nthe yacht, I led the way across the deck.  The forward house was closed\r\nand locked, and no knocking produced any indication of life.  The after\r\nhouse we found not only locked, but barred across with strips of wood\r\nnailed into place.  The forecastle was likewise closed.  It was a dead\r\nship.\r\n\r\nNo figure reappearing to alarm him, Mac took the drawing out of his\r\npocket and focused the flashlight on it.\r\n\r\n\"This cross by the mainmast,\" he said \"that would be where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right behind you, there.\"\r\n\r\nHe walked to the mast, and examined carefully around its base. There\r\nwas nothing there, and even now I do not know to what that cross\r\nalluded, unless poor Schwartz--!\r\n\r\n\"Then this other one--forward, you call it, don't you?  Suppose we\r\nlocate that.\"\r\n\r\nAll expectation of the watchman having now died, we went forward on the\r\nport side to the approximate location of the cross.  This being in the\r\nneighborhood where Mac had thought he saw something move, we approached\r\nwith extreme caution.  But nothing more ominous was discovered than the\r\nport lifeboat, nothing more ghostly heard than the occasional creak\r\nwith which it rocked in its davits.\r\n\r\nThe lifeboat seemed to be indicated by the cross.  It swung almost\r\nshoulder-high on McWhirter.  We looked under and around it, with a\r\ngrowing feeling that we had misread the significance of the crosses, or\r\nthat the sinister record extended to a time before the \"she devil\" of\r\nthe Turner line was dressed in white and turned into a lady.\r\n\r\nI was feeling underneath the boat, with a sense of absurdity that\r\nMcWhirter put into words.  \"I only hope,\" he said, \"that the watchman\r\ndoes not wake up now and see us.  He'd be justified in filling us with\r\nlead, or putting us in straitjackets.\"\r\n\r\nBut I had discovered something.\r\n\r\n\"Mac,\" I said, \"some one has been at this boat within the last few\r\nminutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Take your revolver and watch the deck.  One of the barecas--\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"One of the water-barrels has been upset, and the plug is out.  It is\r\nleaking into the boat.  It is leaking fast, and there's only a gallon\r\nor so in the bottom!  Give me the light.\"\r\n\r\nThe contents of the boat revealed the truth of what I had said. The\r\nboat was in confusion.  Its cover had been thrown back, and tins of\r\nbiscuit, bailers, boathooks and extra rowlocks were jumbled together in\r\nconfusion.  The barecas lay on its side, and its plug had been either\r\nknocked or drawn out.\r\n\r\nMcWhirter was for turning to inspect the boat; but I ordered him\r\nsternly to watch the deck.  He was inclined to laugh at my caution,\r\nwhich he claimed was a quality in me he had not suspected.  He lounged\r\nagainst the rail near me, and, in spite of his chaff, kept a keen\r\nenough lookout.\r\n\r\nThe barecas of water were lashed amidships.  In the bow and stern were\r\nsmall air-tight compartments, and in the stern was also a small locker\r\nfrom which the biscuit tins had been taken.  I was about to abandon my\r\nsearch, when I saw something gleaming in the locker, and reached in and\r\ndrew it out.  It appeared to be an ordinary white sheet, but its\r\npresence there was curious.  I turned the light on it.  It was covered\r\nwith dark-brown stains.\r\n\r\nEven now the memory of that sheet turns me ill.  I shook it out, and\r\nMac, at my exclamation, came to me.  It was not a sheet at all, that\r\nis, not a whole one.  It was a circular piece of white cloth, on which,\r\nin black, were curious marks--a six-pointed star predominating.  There\r\nwere others--a crescent, a crude attempt to draw what might be either a\r\ndog or a lamb, and a cross.  From edge to edge it was smeared with\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nOf what followed just after, both McWhirter and I are vague.  There\r\nseemed to be, simultaneously, a yell of fury from the rigging overhead,\r\nand the crash of a falling body on the deck near us.  Then we were\r\nclosing with a kicking, biting, screaming thing, that bore me to the\r\nground, extinguishing the little electric flash, and that, rising\r\nsuddenly from under me, had McWhirter in the air, and almost overboard\r\nbefore I caught him.  So dazed were we by the onslaught that the\r\nthing--whatever it was--could have escaped, and left us none the wiser.\r\nBut, although it eluded us in the darkness, it did not leave.  It was\r\nthere, whimpering to itself, searching for something--the sheet.  As I\r\nsteadied Mac, it passed me.  I caught at it.  Immediately the struggle\r\nbegan all over again.  But this time we had the advantage, and kept it.\r\nAfter a battle that seemed to last all night, and that was actually\r\nfought all over that part of the deck, we held the creature subdued,\r\nand Mac, getting a hand free, struck a match.\r\n\r\nIt was Charlie Jones.\r\n\r\nThat, after all, is the story.  Jones was a madman, a homicidal maniac\r\nof the worst type.  Always a madman, the homicidal element of his\r\ndisease was recurrent and of a curious nature.\r\n\r\nHe thought himself a priest of heaven, appointed to make ghastly\r\nsacrifices at certain signals from on high.  The signals I am not sure\r\nof; he turned taciturn after his capture and would not talk. I am\r\ninclined to think that a shooting star, perhaps in a particular quarter\r\nof the heavens, was his signal.  This is distinctly possible, and is\r\nmade probable by the stars which he had painted with tar on his\r\nsacrificial robe.\r\n\r\nThe story of the early morning of August 12 will never be fully known;\r\nbut much of it, in view of our knowledge, we were able to reconstruct.\r\nThus--Jones ate his supper that night, a mild and well-disposed\r\nindividual.  During the afternoon before, he had read prayers for the\r\nsoul of Schwartz, in whose departure he may or may not have had a part.\r\nI am inclined to think not, Jones construing his mission as being one\r\nto remove the wicked and the oppressor, and Schwartz hardly coming\r\nunder either classification.\r\n\r\nHe was at the wheel from midnight until four in the morning on the\r\nnight of the murders.  At certain hours we believe that he went forward\r\nto the forecastle-head, and performed, clad in his priestly robe, such\r\ndevotions as his disordered mind dictated.  It is my idea that he\r\nlooked, at these times, for a heavenly signal, either a meteor or some\r\nstrange appearance of the heavens.  It was known that he was a poor\r\nsleeper, and spent much time at night wandering around.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the crimes it is probable that he performed his\r\ndevotions early, and then got the signal.  This is evidenced by\r\nSingleton's finding the axe against the captain's door before midnight.\r\nHe had evidently been disturbed.  We believe that he intended to kill\r\nthe captain and Mr. Turner, but made a mistake in the rooms.  He\r\nclearly intended to kill the Danish girl.  Several passages in his\r\nBible, marked with a red cross, showed his inflamed hatred of loose\r\nwomen; and he believed Karen Hansen to be of that type.\r\n\r\nHe locked me in, slipping down from the wheel to do so, and pocketing\r\nthe key.  The night was fairly quiet.  He could lash the wheel safely,\r\nand he had in his favor the fact that Oleson, the lookout, was a\r\nslow-thinking Swede who notoriously slept on his watch.  He found the\r\naxe, not where he had left it, but back in the case.  But the case was\r\nonly closed, not locked--Singleton's error.\r\n\r\nArmed with the axe, Jones slipped back to the wheel and waited.  He had\r\nplenty of time.  He had taken his robe from its hiding-place in the\r\nboat, and had it concealed near him with the axe.  He was ready, but he\r\nwas waiting for another signal.  He got it at half-past two. He\r\nadmitted the signal and the time, but concealed its nature--I think it\r\nwas a shooting star.  He killed Vail first, believing it to be Turner,\r\nand making with his axe, the four signs of the cross. Then he went to\r\nthe Hansen girl's door.  He did not know about the bell, and probably\r\nrang it by accident as he leaned over to listen if Vail still breathed.\r\n\r\nThe captain, in the mean time, had been watching Singleton.  He had\r\nforbidden his entering the after house; if he caught him disobeying, he\r\nmeant to put him in irons.  He was without shoes or coat, and he sat\r\nwaiting on the after companion steps for developments.\r\n\r\nIt was the captain, probably, whom Karen Hansen mistook for Turner.\r\nLater he went back to the forward companionway, either on his way back\r\nto his cabin, or still with an eye to Singleton's movements.\r\n\r\nTo the captain there must have appeared this grisly figure in flowing\r\nwhite, smeared with blood and armed with an axe.  The sheet was worn\r\nover Jones's head--a long, narrow slit serving him to see through, and\r\ntwo other slits freeing his arms.  The captain was a brave man, but the\r\napparition, gleaming in the almost complete darkness, had been on him\r\nbefore he could do more than throw up his hands.\r\n\r\nJones had not finished.  He went back to the chart-room and possibly\r\neven went on deck and took a look at the wheel.  Then he went down\r\nagain and killed the Hansen woman.\r\n\r\nHe was exceedingly cunning.  He flung the axe into the room, and was up\r\nand at the wheel again, all within a few seconds.  To tear off and fold\r\nup the sheet, to hide it under near-by cordage, to strike the ship's\r\nbell and light his pipe--all this was a matter of two or three minutes.\r\nI had only time to look at Vail.  When I got up to the wheel, Jones was\r\nsmoking quietly.\r\n\r\nI believe he tried to get Singleton later, and failed.  But he\r\ncontinued his devotions on the forward deck, visible when clad in his\r\nrobe, invisible when he took it off.  It was Jones, of course, who\r\nattacked Burns and secured the key to the captain's cabin; Jones who\r\nthrew the axe overboard after hearing the crew tell that on its handle\r\nwere finger-prints to identify the murderer; Jones who, while on guard\r\nin the after house below, had pushed the key to the storeroom under\r\nTurner's door; Jones who hung the marlinespike over the side, waiting\r\nperhaps for another chance at Singleton; Jones, in his devotional\r\nattire, who had frightened the crew into hysteria, and who, discovered\r\nby Mrs. Johns in the captain's cabin, had rushed by her, and out, with\r\nthe axe.  It is noticeable that he made no attempt to attack her.  He\r\nkilled only in obedience to his signal, and he had had no signal.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most curious thing, after the murderer was known, was the\r\nstory of the people in the after house.  It was months before I got\r\nthat in full.  The belief among the women was that Turner, maddened by\r\ndrink and unreasoning jealousy, had killed Vail, and then, running\r\namuck or discovered by the other victims, had killed them.  This was\r\nborne out by Turner's condition.  His hands and parts of his clothing\r\nwere blood-stained.\r\n\r\nTheir condition was pitiable.  Unable to speak for himself, he lay\r\nraving in his room, talking to Vail and complaining of a white figure\r\nthat bothered him.  The key that Elsa Lee picked up was another clue,\r\nand in their attempt to get rid of it I had foiled them.  Mrs. Johns,\r\nan old friend and, as I have said, an ardent partisan, undertook to get\r\nrid of the axe, with the result that we know.  Even Turner's recovery\r\nbrought little courage.  He could only recall that he had gone into\r\nVail's room and tried to wake him, without result; that he did not know\r\nof the blood until the next day, or that Vail was dead; and that he had\r\na vague recollection of something white and ghostly that night--he was\r\nnot sure where he had seen it.\r\n\r\nThe failure of their attempt to get rid of the storeroom key was\r\nmatched by their failure to smuggle Turner's linen off the ship.\r\nSingleton suspected Turner, and, with the skillful and not over\r\nscrupulous aid of his lawyer, had succeeded in finding in Mrs. Sloane's\r\ntrunk the incriminating pieces.\r\n\r\nAs to the meaning of the keys, file, and club in Singleton's mattress,\r\nI believe the explanation is simple enough.  He saw against him a\r\nstrong case.  He had little money and no influence, while Turner had\r\nboth.  I have every reason to believe that he hoped to make his escape\r\nbefore the ship anchored, and was frustrated by my discovery of the\r\nkeys and by an extra bolt I put on his door and window.\r\n\r\nThe murders on the schooner-yacht Ella were solved.\r\n\r\nMcWhirter went back to his hospital, the day after our struggle,\r\nwearing a strip of plaster over the bridge of his nose and a new air of\r\nimportance.  The Turners went to New York soon after, and I was alone.\r\nI tried to put Elsa Lee out of my thoughts, as she had gone out of my\r\nlife, and, receiving the hoped-for hospital appointment at that time, I\r\ntried to make up by hard work for a happiness that I had not lost\r\nbecause it had never been mine.\r\n\r\nA curious thing has happened to me.  I had thought this record\r\nfinished, but perhaps--\r\n\r\nTurner's health is bad.  He and his wife and Miss Lee are going to\r\nEurope.  He has asked me to go with him in my professional capacity!\r\n\r\nIt is more than a year since I have seen her.\r\n\r\nThe year has brought some changes.  Singleton is again a member of the\r\nTurner forces, having signed a contract and a temperance pledge at the\r\nsame sitting.  Jones is in a hospital for the insane, where in the\r\ndaytime he is a cheery old tar with twinkling eyes and a huge mustache,\r\nand where now and then, on Christmas and holidays, I send him a supply\r\nof tobacco.  At night he sleeps in a room with opaque glass windows\r\nthrough which no heavenly signals can penetrate.  He will not talk of\r\nhis crimes,--not that he so regards them,--but now and then in the\r\nnight he wraps the drapery of his couch about him and performs strange\r\norisons in the little room that is his. And at such times an attendant\r\nwatches outside his door.\r\n\nOnce more the swish of spray against the side of a ship, the tang of\r\nsalt, the lift and fall of the rail against the sea-line on the\r\nhorizon.  And once more a girl, in white from neck to heel, facing into\r\nthe wind as if she loved it, her crisp skirts flying, her hair blown\r\nback from her forehead in damp curls.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I am not washing down the deck.  With all the poise of white\r\nflannels and a good cigar, I am lounging in a deck-chair, watching her.\r\nThen--\r\n\r\n\"Come here!\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"I am busy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not busy.  You are disgracefully idle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you want me?\"\r\n\r\nShe comes closer, and looks down at me.  She likes me to sit, so she\r\nmay look superior and scornful, this being impossible when one looks\r\nup.  When she has approached--\r\n\r\n\"Just to show that I can order you about.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall go back!\"--with raised chin.  How I remember that raised chin,\r\nand how (whisper it) I used to fear it!\r\n\r\n\"You cannot.  I am holding the edge of your skirt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ralph!  And all the other passengers looking!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then sit down--and, before you do, tuck that rug under my feet, will\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Under my feet!\"\r\n\r\nShe does it, under protest, whereon I release her skirts.  She is\r\nsulky, quite distinctly sulky.  I slide my hand under the rug into her\r\nlap.  She ignores it.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" I say calmly, \"we are even.  And you might as well hold my hand.\r\nEvery one thinks you are.\"\r\n\r\nShe brings her hands hastily from under her rug and puts them over her\r\nhead.  \"I don't know what has got into you,\" she says coldly. \"And why\r\nare we even?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the day you told me the deck was not clean.\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't clean.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I am going to kiss you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ralph!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is coming on.  About the time that the bishop gets here, I shall\r\nlean over and--\"\r\n\r\nShe eyes me, and sees determination in my face.  She changes color.\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't I!\"\r\n\r\nShe rises hastily, and stands looking down at me.  I am quite sure at\r\nthat moment that she detests me, and I rather like it.  There are\r\nalways times when we detest the people we love.\r\n\r\n\"If you are going to be arbitrary just because you can--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Marsh and the rest are in the smoking room.  Their sitting-room is\r\nempty.\"\r\n\r\nQuite calmly, as if we are going below for a clean handkerchief or a\r\nveil or a cigarette, we stroll down the great staircase of the liner to\r\nthe Turners' sitting-room, and close the door.\r\n\r\nAnd--I kiss her.\r\n\n", "The Window at the White Cat": "In my criminal work anything that wears skirts is a lady, until the law\r\nproves her otherwise. From the frayed and slovenly petticoats of the\r\nwoman who owns a poultry stand in the market and who has grown wealthy\r\nby selling chickens at twelve ounces to the pound, or the silk sweep of\r\nMamie Tracy, whose diamonds have been stolen down on the avenue, or the\r\nstaidly respectable black and middle-aged skirt of the client whose\r\nhusband has found an affinity partial to laces and fripperies, and has\r\nrun off with her--all the wearers are ladies, and as such announced by\r\nHawes. In fact, he carries it to excess. He speaks of his wash lady,\r\nwith a husband who is an ash merchant, and he announced one day in some\r\nexcitement, that the lady who had just gone out had appropriated all the\r\nloose change out of the pocket of his overcoat.\r\n\r\nSo when Hawes announced a lady, I took my feet off my desk, put down the\r\nbrief I had been reading, and rose perfunctorily. With my first glance\r\nat my visitor, however, I threw away my cigar, and I have heard since,\r\nsettled my tie. That this client was different was borne in on me at\r\nonce by the way she entered the room. She had poise in spite of\r\nembarrassment, and her face when she raised her veil was white, refined,\r\nand young.\r\n\r\n\"I did not send in my name,\" she said, when she saw me glancing down for\r\nthe card Hawes usually puts on my table. \"It was advice I wanted, and\r\nI--I did not think the name would matter.\"\r\n\r\nShe was more composed, I think, when she found me considerably older\r\nthan herself. I saw her looking furtively at the graying places over my\r\nears. I am only thirty-five, as far as that goes, but my family,\r\nalthough it keeps its hair, turns gray early--a business asset but a\r\nsocial handicap.\r\n\r\n\"Won't you sit down?\" I asked, pushing out a chair, so that she would\r\nface the light, while I remained in shadow. Every doctor and every\r\nlawyer knows that trick. \"As far as the name goes, perhaps you would\r\nbetter tell me the trouble first. Then, if I think it indispensable, you\r\ncan tell me.\"\r\n\r\nShe acquiesced to this and sat for a moment silent, her gaze absently on\r\nthe windows of the building across. In the morning light my first\r\nimpression was verified. Only too often the raising of a woman's veil in\r\nmy office reveals the ravages of tears, or rouge, or dissipation. My new\r\nclient turned fearlessly to the window an unlined face, with a clear\r\nskin, healthily pale. From where I sat, her profile was beautiful, in\r\nspite of its drooping suggestion of trouble; her first embarrassment\r\ngone, she had forgotten herself and was intent on her errand.\r\n\r\n\"I hardly know how to begin,\" she said, \"but suppose\"--slowly--\"suppose\r\nthat a man, a well-known man, should leave home without warning, not\r\ntaking any clothes except those he wore, and saying he was coming home\r\nto dinner, and he--he--\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped as if her voice had failed her.\r\n\r\n\"And he does not come?\" I prompted.\r\n\r\nShe nodded, fumbling for her handkerchief in her bag.\r\n\r\n\"How long has he been gone?\" I asked. I had heard exactly the same thing\r\nbefore, but to leave a woman like that, hardly more than a girl, and\r\nlovely!\r\n\r\n\"Ten days.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think it ought to be looked into,\" I said decisively, and got\r\nup. Somehow I couldn't sit quietly. A lawyer who is worth anything is\r\nalways a partisan, I suppose, and I never hear of a man deserting his\r\nwife that I am not indignant, the virtuous scorn of the unmarried man,\r\nperhaps. \"But you will have to tell me more than that. Did this\r\ngentleman have any bad habits? That is, did he--er--drink?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to excess. He had been forbidden anything of that sort by his\r\nphysician. He played bridge for money, but I--believe he was rather\r\nlucky.\" She colored uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n\"Married, I suppose?\" I asked casually.\r\n\r\n\"He had been. His wife died when I--\" She stopped and bit her lip. Then\r\nit was not her husband, after all! Oddly enough, the sun came out just\r\nat that moment, spilling a pool of sunlight at her feet, on the dusty\r\nrug with its tobacco-bitten scars.\r\n\r\n\"It is my father,\" she said simply. I was absurdly relieved.\r\n\r\nBut with the realization that I had not a case of desertion on my hands,\r\nI had to view the situation from a new angle.\r\n\r\n\"You are absolutely at a loss to account for his disappearance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have had no word from him?\"\r\n\r\n\"None.\"\r\n\r\n\"He never went away before for any length of time, without telling you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Never. He was away a great deal, but I always knew where to find\r\nhim.\" Her voice broke again and her chin quivered. I thought it wise to\r\nreassure her.\r\n\r\n\"Don't let us worry about this until we are sure it is serious,\" I said.\r\n\"Sometimes the things that seem most mysterious have the simplest\r\nexplanations. He may have written and the letter have miscarried\r\nor--even a slight accident would account--\" I saw I was blundering; she\r\ngrew white and wide-eyed. \"But, of course, that's unlikely too. He would\r\nhave papers to identify him.\"\r\n\r\n\"His pockets were always full of envelopes and things like that,\" she\r\nassented eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think I ought to know his name?\" I asked. \"It need not be\r\nknown outside of the office, and this is a sort of confessional anyhow,\r\nor worse. People tell things to their lawyer that they wouldn't think of\r\ntelling the priest.\"\r\n\r\nHer color was slowly coming back, and she smiled.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Fleming, Margery Fleming,\" she said after a second's\r\nhesitation, \"and my father, Mr. Allan Fleming, is the man. Oh, Mr. Knox,\r\nwhat are we going to do? He has been gone for more than a week!\"\r\n\r\nNo wonder she had wished to conceal the identity of the missing man. So\r\nAllan Fleming was lost! A good many highly respectable citizens would\r\nhope that he might never be found. Fleming, state treasurer, delightful\r\ncompanion, polished gentleman and successful politician of the criminal\r\ntype. Outside in the corridor the office boy was singing under his\r\nbreath. \"Oh once there was a miller,\" he sang, \"who lived in a mill.\" It\r\nbrought back to my mind instantly the reform meeting at the city hall a\r\nyear before, where for a few hours we had blown the feeble spark of\r\nprotest against machine domination to a flame. We had sung a song to\r\nthat very tune, and with this white-faced girl across from me, its words\r\ncame back with revolting truth. It had been printed and circulated\r\nthrough the hall.\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, once there was a capitol\r\n      That sat on a hill,\r\n    As it's too big to steal away\r\n      It's probably there still.\r\n    The ring's hand in the treasury\r\n      And Fleming with a sack.\r\n    They take it out in wagon loads\r\n      And never bring it back.\"\r\n\r\nI put the song out of my mind with a shudder. \"I am more than sorry,\" I\r\nsaid. I was, too; whatever he may have been, he was _her_ father. \"And\r\nof course there are a number of reasons why this ought not to be known,\r\nfor a time at least. After all, as I say, there may be a dozen simple\r\nexplanations, and--there are exigencies in politics--\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate politics!\" she broke in suddenly. \"The very name makes me ill.\r\nWhen I read of women wanting to--to vote and all that, I wonder if they\r\nknow what it means to have to be polite to dreadful people, people who\r\nhave even been convicts, and all that. Why, our last butler had been a\r\nprize fighter!\" She sat upright with her hands on the arms of the chair.\r\n\"That's another thing, too, Mr. Knox. The day after father went away,\r\nCarter left. And he has not come back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Carter was the butler?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"A white man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he left without giving you any warning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He served luncheon the day after father went away, and the maids\r\nsay he went away immediately after. He was not there that evening to\r\nserve dinner, but--he came back late that night, and got into the\r\nhouse, using his key to the servants entrance. He slept there, the maids\r\nsaid, but he was gone before the servants were up and we have not seen\r\nhim since.\"\r\n\r\nI made a mental note of the butler.\r\n\r\n\"We'll go back to Carter again,\" I said. \"Your father has not been ill,\r\nhas he? I mean recently.\"\r\n\r\nShe considered.\r\n\r\n\"I can not think of anything except that he had a tooth pulled.\" She was\r\nquick to resent my smile. \"Oh, I know I'm not helping you,\" she\r\nexclaimed, \"but I have thought over everything until I can not think any\r\nmore. I always end where I begin.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have not noticed any mental symptoms--any lack of memory?\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes filled.\r\n\r\n\"He forgot my birthday, two weeks ago,\" she said. \"It was the first one\r\nhe had ever forgotten, in nineteen of them.\"\r\n\r\nNineteen! Nineteen from thirty-five leaves sixteen!\r\n\r\n\"What I meant was this,\" I explained. \"People sometimes have sudden and\r\nunaccountable lapses of memory and at those times they are apt to stray\r\naway from home. Has your father been worried lately?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has not been himself at all. He has been irritable, even to me, and\r\nterrible to the servants. Only to Carter--he was never ugly to Carter.\r\nBut I do not think it was a lapse of memory. When I remember how he\r\nlooked that morning, I believe that he meant then to go away. It shows\r\nhow he had changed, when he could think of going away without a word,\r\nand leaving me there alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you have no brothers or sisters?\"\r\n\r\n\"None. I came to you--\" there she stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Please tell me how you happened to come to me,\" I urged. \"I think you\r\nknow that I am both honored and pleased.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know where to go,\" she confessed, \"so I took the telephone\r\ndirectory, the classified part under 'Attorneys,' and after I shut my\r\neyes, I put my finger haphazard on the page. It pointed to your name.\"\r\n\r\nI am afraid I flushed at this, but it was a wholesome douche. In a\r\nmoment I laughed.\r\n\r\n\"We will take it as an omen,\" I said, \"and I will do all that I can. But\r\nI am not a detective, Miss Fleming. Don't you think we ought to have\r\none?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the police!\" she shuddered. \"I thought you could do something\r\nwithout calling in a detective.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you tell me what happened the day your father left, and how he\r\nwent away. Tell me the little things too. They may be straws that will\r\npoint in a certain direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first place,\" she began, \"we live on Monmouth Avenue. There are\r\njust the two of us, and the servants: a cook, two housemaids, a\r\nlaundress, a butler and a chauffeur. My father spends much of his time\r\nat the capital, and in the last two years, since my old governess went\r\nback to Germany, at those times I usually go to mother's sisters at\r\nBellwood--Miss Letitia and Miss Jane Maitland.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded: I knew the Maitland ladies well. I had drawn four different\r\nwills for Miss Letitia in the last year.\r\n\r\n\"My father went away on the tenth of May. You say to tell you all about\r\nhis going, but there is nothing to tell. We have a machine, but it was\r\nbeing repaired. Father got up from breakfast, picked up his hat and\r\nwalked out of the house. He was irritated at a letter he had read at the\r\ntable--\"\r\n\r\n\"Could you find that letter?\" I asked quickly.\r\n\r\n\"He took it with him. I knew he was disturbed, for he did not even say\r\nhe was going. He took a car, and I thought he was on his way to his\r\noffice. He did not come home that night and I went to the office the\r\nnext morning. The stenographer said he had not been there. He is not at\r\nPlattsburg, because they have been trying to call him from there on the\r\nlong distance telephone every day.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of her candid face I was sure she was holding something back.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you tell me everything?\" I asked. \"You may be keeping back\r\nthe one essential point.\"\r\n\r\nShe flushed. Then she opened her pocket-book and gave me a slip of rough\r\npaper. On it, in careless figures, was the number \"eleven twenty-two.\"\r\nThat was all.\r\n\r\n\"I was afraid you would think it silly,\" she said. \"It was such a\r\nmeaningless thing. You see, the second night after father left, I was\r\nnervous and could not sleep. I expected him home at any time and I kept\r\nlistening for his step down-stairs. About three o'clock I was sure I\r\nheard some one in the room below mine--there was a creaking as if the\r\nperson were walking carefully. I felt relieved, for I thought he had\r\ncome back. But I did not hear the door into his bedroom close, and I got\r\nmore and more wakeful. Finally I got up and slipped along the hall to\r\nhis room. The door was open a few inches and I reached in and switched\r\non the electric lights. I had a queer feeling before I turned on the\r\nlight that there was some one standing close to me, but the room was\r\nempty, and the hall, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the paper?\"\r\n\r\n\"When I saw the room was empty I went in. The paper had been pinned to a\r\npillow on the bed. At first I thought it had been dropped or had blown\r\nthere. When I saw the pin I was startled. I went back to my room and\r\nrang for Annie, the second housemaid, who is also a sort of personal\r\nmaid of mine. It was half-past three o'clock when Annie came down. I\r\ntook her into father's room and showed her the paper. She was sure it\r\nwas not there when she folded back the bed clothes for the night at\r\nnine o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eleven twenty-two,\" I repeated. \"Twice eleven is twenty-two. But that\r\nisn't very enlightening.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she admitted. \"I thought it might be a telephone number, and I\r\ncalled up all the eleven twenty-twos in the city.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, I laughed, and after a moment she smiled in\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\n\"We are not brilliant, certainly,\" I said at last. \"In the first place,\r\nMiss Fleming, if I thought the thing was very serious I would not\r\nlaugh--but no doubt a day or two will see everything straight. But, to\r\ngo back to this eleven twenty-two--did you rouse the servants and have\r\nthe house searched?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Annie said Carter had come back and she went to waken him, but\r\nalthough his door was locked inside, he did not answer. Annie and I\r\nswitched on all the lights on the lower floor from the top of the\r\nstairs. Then we went down together and looked around. Every window and\r\ndoor was locked, but in father's study, on the first floor, two drawers\r\nof his desk were standing open. And in the library, the little\r\ncompartment in my writing-table, where I keep my house money, had been\r\nbroken open and the money taken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing else was gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. The silver on the sideboard in the dining-room, plenty of\r\nvaluable things in the cabinet in the drawing-room--nothing was\r\ndisturbed.\"\r\n\r\n\"It might have been Carter,\" I reflected. \"Did he know where you kept\r\nyour house money?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is possible, but I hardly think so. Besides, if he was going to\r\nsteal, there were so many more valuable things in the house. My mother's\r\njewels as well as my own were in my dressing-room, and the door was not\r\nlocked.\"\r\n\r\n\"They were not disturbed?\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"They had been disturbed,\" she admitted. \"My grandmother left each of\r\nher children some unstrung pearls. They were a hobby with her. Aunt Jane\r\nand Aunt Letitia never had theirs strung, but my mother's were made into\r\ndifferent things, all old-fashioned. I left them locked in a drawer in\r\nmy sitting-room, where I have always kept them. The following morning\r\nthe drawer was unlocked and partly open, but nothing was missing.\"\r\n\r\n\"All your jewelry was there?\"\r\n\r\n\"All but one ring, which I rarely remove from my finger.\" I followed her\r\neyes. Under her glove was the outline of a ring, a solitaire stone.\r\n\r\n\"Nineteen from--\" I shook myself together and got up.\r\n\r\n\"It does not sound like an ordinary burglary,\" I reflected. \"But I am\r\nafraid I have no imagination. No doubt what you have told me would be\r\nmeat and drink to a person with an analytical turn of mind. I can't\r\ndeduct. Nineteen from thirty-five leaves sixteen, according to my mental\r\nprocess, although I know men who could make the difference nothing.\"\r\n\r\nI believe she thought I was a little mad, for her face took on again its\r\ndespairing look.\r\n\r\n\"We _must_ find him, Mr. Knox,\" she insisted as she got up. \"If you know\r\nof a detective that you can trust, please get him. But you can\r\nunderstand that the unexplained absence of the state treasurer must be\r\nkept secret. One thing I am sure of: he is being kept away. You don't\r\nknow what enemies he has! Men like Mr. Schwartz, who have no scruples,\r\nno principle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Schwartz!\" I repeated in surprise. Henry Schwartz was the boss of his\r\nparty in the state; the man of whom one of his adversaries had said,\r\nwith the distinct approval of the voting public, that he was so low in\r\nthe scale of humanity that it would require a special dispensation of\r\nHeaven to raise him to the level of total degradation. But he and\r\nFleming were generally supposed to be captain and first mate of the\r\npirate craft that passed with us for the ship of state.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Schwartz and my father are allies politically,\" the girl explained\r\nwith heightened color, \"but they are not friends. My father is a\r\ngentleman.\"\r\n\r\nThe inference I allowed to pass unnoticed, and as if she feared she had\r\nsaid too much, the girl rose. When she left, a few minutes later, it was\r\nwith the promise that she would close the Monmouth Avenue house and go\r\nto her aunts at Bellwood, at once. For myself, I pledged a thorough\r\nsearch for her father, and began it by watching the scarlet wing on her\r\nhat through the top of the elevator cage until it had descended out of\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nI am afraid it was a queer hodgepodge of clues and sentiment that I\r\npoured out to Hunter, the detective, when he came up late that\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nHunter was quiet when I finished my story.\r\n\r\n\"They're rotten clear through,\" he reflected. \"This administration is\r\nworse than the last, and it was a peach. There have been more suicides\r\nthan I could count on my two hands, in the last ten years. I warn\r\nyou--you'd be better out of this mess.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think about the eleven twenty-two?\" I asked as he got up\r\nand buttoned his coat.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it might mean almost anything. It might be that many dollars, or\r\nthe time a train starts, or it might be the eleventh and the\r\ntwenty-second letters of the alphabet--k--v.\"\r\n\r\n\"K--v!\" I repeated, \"Why that would be the Latin _cave_--beware.\"\r\n\r\nHunter smiled cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"You'd better stick to the law, Mr. Knox,\" he said from the door. \"We\r\ndon't use Latin in the detective business.\"\r\n\nPlattsburg was not the name of the capital, but it will do for this\r\nstory. The state doesn't matter either. You may take your choice, like\r\nthe story Mark Twain wrote, with all kinds of weather at the beginning,\r\nso the reader could take his pick.\r\n\r\nWe will say that my home city is Manchester. I live with my married\r\nbrother, his wife and two boys. Fred is older than I am, and he is an\r\nexceptional brother. On the day he came home from his wedding trip, I\r\nwent down with my traps on a hansom, in accordance with a prearranged\r\nschedule. Fred and Edith met me inside the door.\r\n\r\n\"Here's your latch-key, Jack,\" Fred said, as he shook hands. \"Only one\r\nstipulation--remember we are strangers in the vicinity and try to get\r\nhome before the neighbors are up. We have our reputations to think of.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no hour for breakfast,\" Edith said, as she kissed me. \"You\r\nhave a bath of your own, and don't smoke in the drawing-room.\"\r\n\r\nFred was always a lucky devil.\r\n\r\nI had been there now for six years. I had helped to raise two young\r\nKnoxes--bully youngsters, too: the oldest one could use boxing-gloves\r\nwhen he was four--and the finest collie pup in our end of the state. I\r\nwanted to raise other things--the boys liked pets--but Edith was like\r\nall women, she didn't care for animals.\r\n\r\nI had a rabbit-hutch built and stocked in the laundry, and a dove-cote\r\non the roof. I used the general bath, and gave up my tub to a young\r\nalligator I got in Florida, and every Sunday the youngsters and I had a\r\ngreat time trying to teach it to do tricks. I have always taken it a\r\nlittle hard that Edith took advantage of my getting the measles from\r\nBilly, to clear out every animal in the house. She broke the news to me\r\ngently, the day the rash began to fade, maintaining that, having lost\r\none cook through the alligator escaping from his tub and being mistaken,\r\nin the gloom of the back-stairs, for a rubber boot, and picked up under\r\nthe same misapprehension, she could not risk another cook.\r\n\r\nOn the day that Margery Fleming came to me about her father, I went home\r\nin a state of mixed emotion. Dinner was not a quiet meal: Fred and I\r\ntalked politics, generally, and as Fred was on one side and I on the\r\nother there was always an argument on.\r\n\r\n\"What about Fleming?\" I asked at last, when Fred had declared that in\r\nthese days of corruption, no matter what the government was, he was\r\n\"forninst\" it. \"Hasn't he been frightened into reform?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bad egg,\" he said, jabbing his potato as if it had been a politician,\r\n\"and there's no way to improve a bad egg except to hold your nose.\r\nThat's what the public is doing; holding its nose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hasn't he a daughter?\" I asked casually.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--a lovely girl, too,\" Edith assented. \"It is his only redeeming\r\nquality.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fleming is a rascal, daughter or no daughter,\" Fred persisted. \"Ever\r\nsince he and his gang got poor Butler into trouble and then left him to\r\nkill himself as the only way out, I have felt that there was something\r\ncoming to all of them--Hansen, Schwartz and the rest. I saw Fleming on\r\nthe street to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" I exclaimed, almost jumping out of my chair.\r\n\r\nFred surveyed me quizzically over his coffee cup.\r\n\r\n\"'Hasn't he a daughter!'\" he quoted. \"Yes, I saw him, Jack, this very\r\nday, in an unromantic four-wheeler, and he was swearing at a policeman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Chestnut and Union. His cab had been struck by a car, and badly\r\ndamaged, but the gentleman refused to get out. No doubt you could get\r\nthe details from the corner-man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Fred,\" I said earnestly. \"Keep that to yourself, will you?\r\nAnd you too, Edith? It's a queer story, and I'll tell you sometime.\"\r\n\r\nAs we left the dining-room Edith put her hand on my shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Don't get mixed up with those people, Jack,\" she advised. \"Margery's a\r\ndear girl, but her father practically killed Henry Butler, and Henry\r\nButler married my cousin.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't make it a family affair,\" I protested. \"I have only seen\r\nthe girl once.\"\r\n\r\nBut Edith smiled. \"I know what I know,\" she said. \"How extravagant of\r\nyou to send Bobby that enormous hobby-horse!\"\r\n\r\n\"The boy has to learn to ride sometime. In four years he can have a\r\npony, and I'm going to see that he has it. He'll be eight by that time.\"\r\n\r\nEdith laughed.\r\n\r\n\"In four years!\" she said, \"Why, in four years you'll--\" then she\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n\"I'll what?\" I demanded, blocking the door to the library.\r\n\r\n\"You'll be forty, Jack, and it's a mighty unattractive man who gets past\r\nforty without being sought and won by some woman. You'll be buying--\"\r\n\r\n\"I will be thirty-nine,\" I said with dignity, \"and as far as being\r\nsought and won goes, I am so overwhelmed by Fred's misery that I don't\r\nintend to marry at all. If I do--_if I do_--it will be to some girl who\r\nturns and runs the other way every time she sees me.\"\r\n\r\n\"The oldest trick in the box,\" Edith scoffed. \"What's that thing Fred's\r\nalways quoting: 'A woman is like a shadow; follow her, she flies; fly\r\nfrom her, she follows.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word!\" I said indignantly. \"And you are a woman!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm different,\" she retorted. \"I'm only a wife and mother.\"\r\n\r\nIn the library Fred got up from his desk and gathered up his papers. \"I\r\ncan't think with you two whispering there,\" he said, \"I'm going to the\r\nden.\"\r\n\r\nAs he slammed the door into his workroom Edith picked up her skirts and\r\nscuttled after him.\r\n\r\n\"How dare you run away like that?\" she called. \"You promised me--\" The\r\ndoor closed behind her.\r\n\r\nI went over and spoke through the panels.\r\n\r\n\"'Follow her, she flies; fly from her, she follows'--oh, wife and\r\nmother!\" I called.\r\n\r\n\"For Heaven's sake, Edith,\" Fred's voice rose irritably. \"If you and\r\nJack are going to talk all evening, go and sit on _his_ knee and let me\r\nalone. The way you two flirt under my nose is a scandal. Do you hear\r\nthat, Jack?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night, Edith,\" I called, \"I have left you a kiss on the upper left\r\nhand panel of the door. And I want to ask you one more question: what if\r\nI fly from the woman and she doesn't follow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank your lucky stars,\" Fred called in a muffled voice, and I left\r\nthem to themselves.\r\n\r\nI had some work to do at the office, work that the interview with Hunter\r\nhad interrupted, and half past eight that night found me at my desk. But\r\nmy mind strayed from the papers before me. After a useless effort to\r\nconcentrate, I gave it up as useless, and by ten o'clock I was on the\r\nstreet again, my evening wasted, the papers in the libel case of the\r\n_Star_ against the _Eagle_ untouched on my desk, and I the victim of an\r\nuneasy apprehension that took me, almost without volition, to the\r\nneighborhood of the Fleming house on Monmouth Avenue. For it had\r\noccurred to me that Miss Fleming might not have left the house that day\r\nas she had promised, might still be there, liable to another intrusion\r\nby the mysterious individual who had a key to the house.\r\n\r\nIt was a relief, consequently, when I reached its corner, to find no\r\nlights in the building. The girl had kept her word. Assured of that, I\r\nlooked at the house curiously. It was one of the largest in the city,\r\nnot wide, but running far back along the side street; a small yard with\r\na low iron fence and a garage, completed the property. The street lights\r\nleft the back of the house in shadow, and as I stopped in the shelter of\r\nthe garage, I was positive that I heard some one working with a rear\r\nwindow of the empty house. A moment later the sounds ceased and muffled\r\nfootsteps came down the cement walk. The intruder made no attempt to\r\nopen the iron gate; against the light I saw him put a leg over the low\r\nfence, follow it up with the other, and start up the street, still with\r\npeculiar noiselessness of stride. He was a short, heavy-shouldered\r\nfellow in a cap, and his silhouette showed a prodigious length of arm.\r\n\r\nI followed, I don't mind saying in some excitement. I had a vision of\r\ngrabbing him from behind and leading him--or pushing him, under the\r\ncircumstances, in triumph to the police station, and another mental\r\npicture, not so pleasant, of being found on the pavement by some\r\npasser-by, with a small punctuation mark ending my sentence of life. But\r\nI was not apprehensive. I even remember wondering humorously if I should\r\novertake him and press the cold end of my silver mounted fountain pen\r\ninto the nape of his neck, if he would throw up his hands and surrender.\r\nI had read somewhere of a burglar held up in a similar way with a\r\nshoe-horn.\r\n\r\nOur pace was easy. Once the man just ahead stopped and lighted a\r\ncigarette, and the odor of a very fair Turkish tobacco came back to me.\r\nHe glanced back over his shoulder at me and went on without quickening\r\nhis pace. We met no policemen, and after perhaps five minutes walking,\r\nwhen the strain was growing tense, my gentleman of the rubber-soled\r\nshoes swung abruptly to the left, and--entered the police station!\r\n\r\nI had occasion to see Davidson many times after that, during the strange\r\ndevelopment of the Fleming case; I had the peculiar experience later of\r\nhaving him follow me as I had trailed him that night, and I had occasion\r\nonce to test the strength of his long arms when he helped to thrust me\r\nthrough the transom at the White Cat, but I never met him without a\r\nrecurrence of the sheepish feeling with which I watched him swagger up\r\nto the night sergeant and fall into easy conversation with the man\r\nbehind the desk. Standing in the glare from the open window, I had much\r\nthe lost pride and self contempt of a wet cat sitting in the sun.\r\n\r\nTwo or three roundsmen were sitting against the wall, lazily, helmets\r\noff and coats open against the warmth of the early spring night. In a\r\nback room others were playing checkers and disputing noisily. Davidson's\r\nvoice came distinctly through the open windows.\r\n\r\n\"The house is closed,\" he reported. \"But one of the basement windows\r\nisn't shuttered and the lock is bad. I couldn't find Shields. He'd\r\nbetter keep an eye on it.\" He stopped and fished in his pockets with a\r\ngrin. \"This was tied to the knob of the kitchen door,\" he said, raising\r\nhis voice for the benefit of the room, and holding aloft a piece of\r\npaper. \"For Shields!\" he explained, \"and signed 'Delia.'\"\r\n\r\nThe men gathered around him, even the sergeant got up and leaned\r\nforward, his elbows on his desk.\r\n\r\n\"Read it,\" he said lazily. \"Shields has got a wife; and her name ain't\r\nDelia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear Tom,\" Davidson read, in a mincing falsetto, \"We are closing up\r\nunexpected, so I won't be here to-night. I am going to Mamie Brennan's\r\nand if you want to talk to me you can get me by calling up Anderson's\r\ndrug-store. The clerk is a gentleman friend of mine. Mr. Carter, the\r\nbutler, told me before he left he would get me a place as parlor maid,\r\nso I'll have another situation soon. Delia.\"\r\n\r\nThe sergeant scowled. \"I'm goin' to talk to Tom,\" he said, reaching out\r\nfor the note. \"He's got a nice family, and things like that're bad for\r\nthe force.\"\r\n\r\nI lighted the cigar, which had been my excuse for loitering on the\r\npavement, and went on. It sounded involved for a novice, but if I could\r\nfind Anderson's drug-store I could find Mamie Brennan; through Mamie\r\nBrennan I would get Delia; and through Delia I might find Carter. I was\r\nvague from that point, but what Miss Fleming had said of Carter had made\r\nme suspicious of him. Under an arc light I made the first note in my\r\nnew business of man-hunter and it was something like this:\r\n\r\nAnderson's drug-store.\r\n\r\nAsk for Mamie Brennan.\r\n\r\nFind Delia.\r\n\r\nAdvise Delia that a policeman with a family is a bad bet.\r\n\r\nLocate Carter.\r\n\r\nIt was late when I reached the corner of Chestnut and Union Streets,\r\nwhere Fred had said Allan Fleming had come to grief in a cab. But the\r\ncorner-man had gone, and the night man on the beat knew nothing, of\r\ncourse, of any particular collision.\r\n\r\n\"There's plinty of 'em every day at this corner,\" he said cheerfully.\r\n\"The department sinds a wagon here every night to gather up the pieces,\r\nautymobiles mainly. That trolley pole over there has been sliced off\r\nclean three times in the last month. They say a fellow ain't a graduate\r\nof the autymobile school till he can go around it on the sidewalk\r\nwithout hittin' it!\"\r\n\r\nI left him looking reminiscently at the pole, and went home to bed. I\r\nhad made no headway, I had lost conceit with myself and a day and\r\nevening at the office, and I had gained the certainty that Margery\r\nFleming was safe in Bellwood and the uncertain address of a servant who\r\n_might_ know something about Mr. Fleming.\r\n\r\nI was still awake at one o'clock and I got up impatiently and consulted\r\nthe telephone directory. There were twelve Andersons in the city who\r\nconducted drug-stores.\r\n\r\nWhen I finally went to sleep, I dreamed that I was driving Margery\r\nFleming along a street in a broken taxicab, and that all the buildings\r\nwere pharmacies and numbered eleven twenty-two.\r\n\nAfter such a night I slept late. Edith still kept her honeymoon promise\r\nof no breakfast hour and she had gone out with Fred when I came\r\ndown-stairs.\r\n\r\nI have a great admiration for Edith, for her tolerance with my uncertain\r\nhours, for her cheery breakfast-room, and the smiling good nature of the\r\nservants she engages. I have a theory that, show me a sullen servant and\r\nI will show you a sullen mistress, although Edith herself disclaims all\r\nresponsibility and lays credit for the smile with which Katie brings in\r\nmy eggs and coffee, to largess on my part. Be that as it may, Katie is a\r\nsmiling and personable young woman, and I am convinced that had she\r\npicked up the alligator on the back-stairs and lost part of the end of\r\nher thumb, she would have told Edith that she cut it off with the bread\r\nknife, and thus have saved to us Bessie the Beloved and her fascinating\r\ntrick of taking the end of her tail in her mouth and spinning.\r\n\r\nOn that particular morning, Katie also brought me a letter, and I\r\nrecognized the cramped and rather uncertain writing of Miss Jane\r\nMaitland.\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR MR. KNOX:\r\n\r\n     \"Sister Letitia wishes me to ask you if you can dine with us\r\n     to-night, informally. She has changed her mind in regard to the\r\n     Colored Orphans' Home, and would like to consult you about it.\r\n\r\n    \"Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n    \"SUSAN JANE MAITLAND.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a very commonplace note: I had had one like it after every\r\nboard-meeting of the orphans' home, Miss Maitland being on principle an\r\naggressive minority. Also, having considerable mind, changing it became\r\nalmost as ponderous an operation as moving a barn, although not nearly\r\nso stable.\r\n\r\n(Fred accuses me here of a very bad pun, and reminds me, quite\r\nundeservedly, that the pun is the lowest form of humor.)\r\n\r\nI came across Miss Jane's letter the other day, when I was gathering\r\nthe material for this narrative, and I sat for a time with it in my hand\r\nthinking over again the chain of events in which it had been the first\r\nlink, a series of strange happenings that began with my acceptance of\r\nthe invitation, and that led through ways as dark and tricks as vain as\r\nBret Harte's Heathen Chinee ever dreamed of, to the final scene at the\r\nWhite Cat. With the letter I had filed away a half dozen articles and I\r\nranged them all on the desk in front of me: the letter, the bit of paper\r\nwith eleven twenty-two on it, that Margery gave me the first time I saw\r\nher; a note-book filled with jerky characters that looked like Arabic\r\nand were newspaper shorthand; a railroad schedule; a bullet, the latter\r\nslightly flattened; a cube-shaped piece of chalk which I put back in its\r\nbox with a shudder, and labeled 'poison,' and a small gold buckle from a\r\nslipper, which I--at which I did not shudder.\r\n\r\nI did not need to make the climaxes of my story. They lay before me.\r\n\r\nI walked to the office that morning, and on the way I found and\r\ninterviewed the corner-man at Chestnut and Union. But he was of small\r\nassistance. He remembered the incident, but the gentleman in the taxicab\r\nhad not been hurt and refused to give his name, saying he was merely\r\npassing through the city from one railroad station to another, and did\r\nnot wish any notoriety.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o'clock Hunter called up; he said he was going after the\r\naffair himself, but that it was hard to stick a dip net into the\r\npolitical puddle without pulling out a lot more than you went after, or\r\nthan it was healthy to get. He was inclined to be facetious, and wanted\r\nto know if I had come across any more k. v's. Whereupon I put away the\r\nnotes I had made about Delia and Mamie Brennan and I heard him chuckle\r\nas I rang off.\r\n\r\nI went to Bellwood that evening. It was a suburban town a dozen miles\r\nfrom the city, with a picturesque station, surrounded by lawns and\r\ncement walks. Street-cars had so far failed to spoil its tree-bordered\r\nstreets, and it was exclusive to the point of stagnation. The Maitland\r\nplace was at the head of the main street, which had at one time been its\r\ndrive. Miss Letitia, who was seventy, had had sufficient commercial\r\ninstinct, some years before, to cut her ancestral acres--_their_\r\nancestral acres, although Miss Jane hardly counted--into building lots,\r\nexcept perhaps an acre which surrounded the house. Thus, the Maitland\r\nladies were reputed to be extremely wealthy. And as they never spent any\r\nmoney, no doubt they were.\r\n\r\nThe homestead as I knew it, was one of impeccable housekeeping and\r\nunmitigated gloom. There was a chill that rushed from the old-fashioned\r\ncenter hall to greet the new-comer on the porch, and that seemed to\r\nfreeze up whatever in him was spontaneous and cheerful.\r\n\r\nI had taken dinner at Bellwood before, and the memory was not hilarious.\r\nMiss Letitia was deaf, but chose to ignore the fact. With superb\r\nindifference she would break into the conversation with some wholly\r\nalien remark that necessitated a reassembling of one's ideas, making the\r\nmeal a series of mental gymnastics. Miss Jane, through long practice,\r\nand because she only skimmed the surface of conversation, took her\r\ncerebral flights easily, but I am more unwieldy of mind.\r\n\r\nNor was Miss Letitia's dominance wholly conversational. Her sister Jane\r\nwas her creature, alternately snubbed and bullied. To Miss Letitia,\r\nJane, in spite of her sixty-five years, was still a child, and sometimes\r\na bad one. Indeed, many a child of ten is more sophisticated. Miss\r\nLetitia gave her expurgated books to read, and forbade her to read\r\ndivorce court proceedings in the newspapers. Once, a recreant housemaid\r\npresenting the establishment with a healthy male infant, Jane was sent\r\nto the country for a month, and was only brought back when the house had\r\nbeen fumigated throughout.\r\n\r\nPoor Miss Jane! She met me with fluttering cordiality in the hall that\r\nnight, safe in being herself for once, with the knowledge that Miss\r\nLetitia always received me from a throne-like horsehair sofa in the back\r\nparlor. She wore a new lace cap, and was twitteringly excited.\r\n\r\n\"Our niece is here,\" she explained, as I took off my coat--everything\r\nwas \"ours\" with Jane; \"mine\" with Letitia--\"and we are having an ice at\r\ndinner. Please say that ices are not injurious, Mr. Knox. My sister is\r\nso opposed to them and I had to beg for this.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, the doctors have ordered ices for my young nephews,\" I\r\nsaid gravely, \"and I dote on them myself.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Jane beamed. Indeed, there was something almost unnaturally gay\r\nabout the little old lady all that evening. Perhaps it was the new lace\r\ncap. Later, I tried to analyze her manner, to recall exactly what she\r\nhad said, to remember anything that could possibly help. But I could\r\nfind no clue to what followed.\r\n\r\nMiss Letitia received me as usual, in the back parlor. Miss Fleming was\r\nthere also, sewing by a window, and in her straight white dress with her\r\nhair drawn back and braided around her head, she looked even younger\r\nthan before. There was no time for conversation. Miss Letitia launched\r\nat once into the extravagance of both molasses and butter on the colored\r\norphans' bread and after a glance at me, and a quick comprehension from\r\nmy face that I had no news for her, the girl at the window bent over her\r\nsewing again.\r\n\r\n\"Molasses breeds worms,\" Miss Letitia said decisively. \"So does pork.\r\nAnd yet those children think Heaven means ham and molasses three times\r\na day.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have had no news at all?\" Miss Fleming said cautiously, her head\r\nbent over her work.\r\n\r\n\"None,\" I returned, under cover of the table linen to which Miss\r\nLetitia's mind had veered. \"I have a good man working on it.\" As she\r\nglanced at me questioningly, \"It needed a detective, Miss Fleming.\"\r\nEvidently another day without news had lessened her distrust of the\r\npolice, for she nodded acquiescence and went on with her sewing. Miss\r\nLetitia's monotonous monologue went on, and I gave it such attention as\r\nI might. For the lamps had been lighted, and with every movement of the\r\ngirl across, I could see the gleaming of a diamond on her engagement\r\nfinger.\r\n\r\n\"If I didn't watch her, Jane would ruin them,\" said Miss Letitia. \"She\r\ngives 'em apples when they keep their faces clean, and the bills for\r\nsoap have gone up double. Soap once a day's enough for a colored child.\r\nDo you smell anything burning, Knox?\"\r\n\r\nI sniffed and lied, whereupon Miss Letitia swept her black silk, her\r\ncolored orphans and her majestic presence out of the room. As the door\r\nclosed, Miss Fleming put down her sewing and rose. For the first time I\r\nsaw how weary she looked.\r\n\r\n\"I do not dare to tell them, Mr. Knox,\" she said. \"They are old, and\r\nthey hate him anyhow. I couldn't sleep last night. Suppose he should\r\nhave gone back, and found the house closed!\"\r\n\r\n\"He would telephone here at once, wouldn't he?\" I suggested.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so, yes.\" She took up her sewing from the chair with a sigh.\r\n\"But I'm afraid he won't come--not soon. I have hemmed tea towels for\r\nAunt Letitia to-day until I am frantic, and all day I have been\r\nwondering over something you said yesterday. You said, you remember,\r\nthat you were not a detective, that some men could take nineteen from\r\nthirty-five and leave nothing. What did you mean?\"\r\n\r\nI was speechless for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is--I--you see,\" I blundered, \"it was a--merely a figure of\r\nspeech, a--speech of figures is more accurate,--\" And then dinner was\r\nannounced and I was saved. But although she said little or nothing\r\nduring the meal, I caught her looking across at me once or twice in a\r\nbewildered, puzzled fashion. I could fairly see her revolving my\r\ndetestable figures in her mind.\r\n\r\nMiss Letitia presided over the table in garrulous majesty. The two old\r\nladies picked at their food, and Miss Jane had a spot of pink in each\r\nwithered cheek. Margery Fleming made a brave pretense, but left her\r\nplate almost untouched. As for me, I ate a substantial masculine meal\r\nand half apologized for my appetite, but Letitia did not hear. She tore\r\nthe board of managers to shreds with the roast, and denounced them with\r\nthe salad. But Jane was all anxious hospitality.\r\n\r\n\"Please _do_ eat your dinner,\" she whispered. \"I made the salad myself.\r\nAnd I know what it takes to keep a big man going. Harry eats more than\r\nLetitia and I together. Doesn't he, Margery?\"\r\n\r\n\"Harry?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Stevens is an unmitigated fool. I said if they elected her\r\npresident I'd not leave a penny to the home. That's why I sent for you,\r\nKnox.\" And to the maid, \"Tell Heppie to wash those cups in luke-warm\r\nwater. They're the best ones. And not to drink her coffee out of them.\r\nShe let her teeth slip and bit a piece out of one the last time.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Jane leaned forward to me after a smiling glance at her niece\r\nacross.\r\n\r\n\"Harry Wardrop, a cousin's son, and--\" she patted Margery's hand with\r\nits ring--\"soon to be something closer.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl's face colored, but she returned Miss Jane's gentle pressure.\r\n\r\n\"They put up an iron fence,\" Miss Letitia reverted somberly to her\r\ngrievance, \"when a wooden one would have done. It was extravagance,\r\nruinous extravagance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Harry stays with us when he is in Manchester,\" Miss Jane went on,\r\nnodding brightly across at Letitia as if she, too, were damning the\r\nexecutive board. \"Lately, he has been almost all the time in Plattsburg.\r\nHe is secretary to Margery's father. It is a position of considerable\r\nresponsibility, and we are very proud of him.\"\r\n\r\nI had expected something of the sort, but the remainder of the meal had\r\nsomehow lost its savor. There was a lull in the conversation while\r\ndessert was being brought in. Miss Jane sat quivering, watching her\r\nsister's face for signs of trouble; the latter had subsided into\r\nmuttered grumbling, and Miss Fleming sat, one hand on the table, staring\r\nabsently at her engagement ring.\r\n\r\n\"You look like a fool in that cap, Jane,\" volunteered Letitia, while the\r\nplates were being brought in. \"What's for dessert?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ice-cream,\" called Miss Jane, over the table.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you needn't,\" snapped Letitia, \"I can hear you well enough. You\r\ntold me it was junket.\"\r\n\r\n\"I said ice-cream, and you said it would be all right,\" poor Jane\r\nshrieked. \"If you drink a cup of hot water after it, it won't hurt you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fiddle,\" Letitia snapped unpleasantly. \"I'm not going to freeze my\r\nstomach and then thaw it out like a drain pipe. Tell Heppie to put my\r\nice-cream on the stove.\"\r\n\r\nSo we waited until Miss Letitia's had been heated, and was brought in,\r\nsicklied over with pale hues, not of thought, but of confectioners'\r\ndyes. Miss Letitia ate it resignedly. \"Like as not I'll break out, I\r\ndid the last time,\" she said gloomily. \"I only hope I don't break out in\r\ncolors.\"\r\n\r\nThe meal was over finally, but if I had hoped for another word alone\r\nwith Margery Fleming that evening, I was foredoomed to disappointment.\r\nLetitia sent the girl, not ungently, to bed, and ordered Jane out of the\r\nroom with a single curt gesture toward the door.\r\n\r\n\"You'd better wash those cups yourself, Jane,\" she said. \"I don't see\r\nany sense anyhow in getting out the best china unless there's real\r\ncompany. Besides, I'm going to talk business.\"\r\n\r\nPoor, meek, spiritless Miss Jane! The situation was absurd in spite of\r\nits pathos. She confided to me once that never in her sixty-five years\r\nof life had she bought herself a gown, or chosen the dinner. She was\r\nsnubbed with painstaking perseverance, and sent out of the room when\r\nsubjects requiring frank handling were under discussion. She was as\r\nunsophisticated as a child of ten, as unworldly as a baby, as--well,\r\npoor Miss Jane, again.\r\n\r\nWhen the door had closed behind her, Miss Letitia listened for a moment,\r\ngot up suddenly and crossing the room with amazing swiftness for her\r\nyears, pounced on the knob and threw it open again. But the passage was\r\nempty; Miss Jane's slim little figure was disappearing into the kitchen.\r\nThe older sister watched her out of sight, and then returned to her sofa\r\nwithout deigning explanation.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't want to see you about the will, Mr. Knox,\" she began without\r\nprelude. \"The will can wait. I ain't going to die just yet--not if I\r\nknow anything. But although I think you'd look a heap better and more\r\nresponsible if you wore some hair on your face, still in most things I\r\nthink you're a man of sense. And you're not too young. That's why I\r\ndidn't send for Harry Wardrop; he's too young.\"\r\n\r\nI winced at that. Miss Letitia leaned forward and put her bony hand on\r\nmy knee.\r\n\r\n\"I've been robbed,\" she announced in a half whisper, and straightened to\r\nwatch the effect of her words.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" I said, properly thunderstruck. I _was_ surprised. I had\r\nalways believed that only the use of the fourth dimension in space would\r\nenable any one, not desired, to gain access to the Maitland house. \"Of\r\nmoney?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not money, although I had a good bit in the house.\" This also I knew.\r\nIt was said of Miss Letitia that when money came into her possession it\r\nwent out of circulation.\r\n\r\n\"Not--the pearls?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nShe answered my question with another.\r\n\r\n\"When you had those pearls appraised for me at the jewelers last year,\r\nhow many were there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite one hundred. I think--yes, ninety-eight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" she corroborated, in triumph. \"They belonged to my mother.\r\nMargery's mother got some of them. That's a good many years ago, young\r\nman. They are worth more than they were then--a great deal more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-two thousand dollars,\" I repeated. \"You remember, Miss Letitia,\r\nthat I protested vigorously at the time against your keeping them in the\r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Letitia ignored this, but before she went on she repeated again her\r\ncat-like pouncing at the door, only to find the hall empty as before.\r\nThis time when she sat down it was knee to knee with me.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday morning,\" she said gravely, \"I got down the box; they have\r\nalways been kept in the small safe in the top of my closet. When Jane\r\nfound a picture of my niece, Margery Fleming, in Harry's room, I thought\r\nit likely there was some truth in the gossip Jane heard about the two,\r\nand--if there was going to be a wedding--why, the pearls were to go to\r\nMargery anyhow. But--I found the door of the safe unlocked and a little\r\nbit open--and ten of the pearls were gone!\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone!\" I echoed. \"Ten of them! Why, it's ridiculous! If ten, why not\r\nthe whole ninety-eight?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do I know?\" she replied with asperity. \"That's what I keep a lawyer\r\nfor: that's why I sent for you.\"\r\n\r\nFor the second time in two days I protested the same thing.\r\n\r\n\"But you need a detective,\" I cried. \"If you can find the thief I will\r\nbe glad to send him where he ought to be, but I couldn't find him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not have the police,\" she persisted inflexibly. \"They will come\r\naround asking impertinent questions, and telling the newspapers that a\r\nfoolish old woman had got what she deserved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you are going to send them to a bank?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have less sense than I thought,\" she snapped. \"I am going to leave\r\nthem where they are, and watch. Whoever took the ten will be back for\r\nmore, mark my words.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't advise it,\" I said decidedly. \"You have most of them now, and\r\nyou might easily lose them all; not only that, but it is not safe for\r\nyou or your sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stuff and nonsense!\" the old lady said, with spirit. \"As for Jane, she\r\ndoesn't even know they are gone. I know who did it. It was the new\r\nhousemaid, Bella MacKenzie. Nobody else could get in. I lock up the\r\nhouse myself at night, and I'm in the habit of doing a pretty thorough\r\njob of it. They went in the last three weeks, for I counted them\r\nSaturday three weeks ago myself. The only persons in the house in that\r\ntime, except ourselves, were Harry, Bella and Hepsibah, who's been here\r\nfor forty years and wouldn't know a pearl from a pickled onion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then--what do you want me to do?\" I asked. \"Have Bella arrested and her\r\ntrunk searched?\"\r\n\r\nI felt myself shrinking in the old lady's esteem every minute.\r\n\r\n\"Her trunk!\" she said scornfully. \"I turned it inside out this morning,\r\npretending I thought she was stealing the laundry soap. Like as not she\r\nhas them buried in the vegetable garden. What I want you to do is to\r\nstay here for three or four nights, to be on hand. When I catch the\r\nthief, I want my lawyer right by.\"\r\n\r\nIt ended by my consenting, of course. Miss Letitia was seldom refused. I\r\ntelephoned to Fred that I would not be home, listened for voices and\r\ndecided Margery Fleming had gone to bed. Miss Jane lighted me to the\r\ndoor of the guest room, and saw that everything was comfortable. Her\r\nthin gray curls bobbed as she examined the water pitcher, saw to the\r\ntowels, and felt the bed linen for dampness. At the door she stopped and\r\nturned around timidly.\r\n\r\n\"Has--has anything happened to disturb my sister?\" she asked. \"She--has\r\nbeen almost irritable all day.\"\r\n\r\nAlmost!\r\n\r\n\"She is worried about her colored orphans,\" I evaded. \"She does not\r\napprove of fireworks for them on the fourth of July.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Jane was satisfied. I watched her little, old, black-robed figure\r\ngo lightly down the hall. Then I bolted the door, opened all the\r\nwindows, and proceeded to a surreptitious smoke.\r\n\nThe windows being wide open, it was not long before a great moth came\r\nwhirring in. He hurled himself at the light and then, dazzled and\r\nsinged, began to beat with noisy thumps against the barrier of the\r\nceiling. Finding no egress there, he was back at the lamp again,\r\nwhirling in dizzy circles until at last, worn out, he dropped to the\r\ntable, where he lay on his back, kicking impotently.\r\n\r\nThe room began to fill with tiny winged creatures that flung themselves\r\nheadlong to destruction, so I put out the light and sat down near the\r\nwindow, with my cigar and my thoughts.\r\n\r\nMiss Letitia's troubles I dismissed shortly. While it was odd that only\r\nten pearls should have been taken, still--in every other way it bore the\r\nmarks of an ordinary theft. The thief might have thought that by leaving\r\nthe majority of the gems he could postpone discovery indefinitely. But\r\nthe Fleming case was of a different order. Taken by itself, Fleming's\r\ndisappearance could have been easily accounted for. There must be times\r\nin the lives of all unscrupulous individuals when they feel the need of\r\nretiring temporarily from the public eye. But the intrusion into the\r\nFleming home, the ransacked desk and the broken money drawer--most of\r\nall, the bit of paper with eleven twenty-two on it--here was a hurdle my\r\nlegal mind refused to take.\r\n\r\nI had finished my second cigar, and was growing more and more wakeful,\r\nwhen I heard a footstep on the path around the house. It was black\r\noutside; when I looked out, as I did cautiously, I could not see even\r\nthe gray-white of the cement walk. The steps had ceased, but there was a\r\nsound of fumbling at one of the shutters below. The catch clicked twice,\r\nas if some thin instrument was being slipped underneath to raise it, and\r\nonce I caught a muttered exclamation.\r\n\r\nI drew in my head and, puffing my cigar until it was glowing, managed by\r\nits light to see that it was a quarter to two. When I listened again,\r\nthe house-breaker had moved to another window, and was shaking it\r\ncautiously.\r\n\r\nWith Miss Letitia's story of the pearls fresh in my mind, I felt at once\r\nthat the thief, finding his ten a prize, had come back for more. My\r\nfirst impulse was to go to the head of my bed, where I am accustomed to\r\nkeep a revolver. With the touch of the tall corner post, however, I\r\nremembered that I was not at home, and that it was not likely there was\r\na weapon in the house.\r\n\r\nFinally, after knocking over an ornament that shattered on the hearth\r\nand sounded like the crash of doom, I found on the mantel a heavy brass\r\ncandlestick, and with it in my hand I stepped into the gloom of the\r\nhallway and felt my way to the stairs.\r\n\r\nThere were no night lights; the darkness was total. I found the stairs\r\nbefore I expected to, and came within an ace of pitching down, headlong.\r\nI had kicked off my shoes--a fact which I regretted later. Once down the\r\nstairs I was on more familiar territory. I went at once into the\r\nlibrary, which was beneath my room, but the sounds at the window had\r\nceased. I thought I heard steps on the walk, going toward the front of\r\nthe house. I wheeled quickly and started for the door, when something\r\nstruck me a terrific blow on the nose. I reeled back and sat down, dizzy\r\nand shocked. It was only when no second blow followed the first that I\r\nrealized what had occurred.\r\n\r\nWith my two hands out before me in the blackness, I had groped, one hand\r\non either side of the open door, which of course I had struck violently\r\nwith my nose. Afterward I found it had bled considerably, and my collar\r\nand tie must have added to my ghastly appearance.\r\n\r\nMy candlestick had rolled under the table, and after crawling around on\r\nmy hands and knees, I found it. I had lost, I suppose, three or four\r\nminutes, and I was raging at my awkwardness and stupidity. No one,\r\nhowever, seemed to have heard the noise. For all her boasted\r\nwatchfulness, Miss Letitia must have been asleep. I got back into the\r\nhall and from there to the dining-room. Some one was fumbling at the\r\nshutters there, and as I looked they swung open. It was so dark outside,\r\nwith the trees and the distance from the street, that only the creaking\r\nof the shutter told it had opened. I stood in the middle of the room,\r\nwith one hand firmly clutching my candlestick.\r\n\r\nBut the window refused to move. The burglar seemed to have no proper\r\ntools; he got something under the sash, but it snapped, and through the\r\nheavy plate-glass I could hear him swearing. Then he abruptly left the\r\nwindow and made for the front of the house.\r\n\r\nI blundered in the same direction, my unshod feet striking on projecting\r\nfurniture and causing me agonies, even through my excitement. When I\r\nreached the front door, however, I was amazed to find it unlocked, and\r\nstanding open perhaps an inch. I stopped uncertainly. I was in a\r\npeculiar position; not even the most ardent admirers of antique brass\r\ncandlesticks indorse them as weapons of offense or defense. But, there\r\nseeming to be nothing else to do, I opened the door quietly and stepped\r\nout into the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe next instant I was flung heavily to the porch floor. I am not a\r\nsmall man by any means, but under the fury of that onslaught I was a\r\nchild. It was a porch chair, I think, that knocked me senseless; I know\r\nI folded up like a jack-knife, and that was all I did know for a few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to I was lying where I had fallen, and a candle was burning\r\nbeside me on the porch floor. It took me a minute to remember, and\r\nanother minute to realize that I was looking into the barrel of a\r\nrevolver. It occurred to me that I had never seen a more villainous face\r\nthan that of the man who held it--which shows my state of mind--and that\r\nmy position was the reverse of comfortable. Then the man behind the gun\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\"What did you do with that bag?\" he demanded, and I felt his knee on my\r\nchest.\r\n\r\n\"What bag?\" I inquired feebly. My head was jumping, and the candle was a\r\nvolcanic eruption of sparks and smoke.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a fool,\" the gentleman with the revolver persisted. \"If I\r\ndon't get that bag within five minutes, I'll fill you as full of holes\r\nas a cheese.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't seen any bag,\" I said stupidly. \"What sort of bag?\" I heard\r\nmy own voice, drunk from the shock. \"Paper bag, laundry bag--\"\r\n\r\n\"You've hidden it in the house,\" he said, bringing the revolver a little\r\ncloser with every word. My senses came back with a jerk and I struggled\r\nto free myself.\r\n\r\n\"Go in and look,\" I responded. \"Let me up from here, and I'll take you\r\nin myself.\"\r\n\r\nThe man's face was a study in amazement and anger.\r\n\r\n\"You'll take me in! You!\" He got up without changing the menacing\r\nposition of the gun. \"You walk in there--here, carry the candle--and\r\ntake me to that bag. Quick, do you hear?\"\r\n\r\nI was too bewildered to struggle. I got up dizzily, but when I tried to\r\nstoop for the candle I almost fell on it. My head cleared after a\r\nmoment, and when I had picked up the candle I had a good chance to look\r\nat my assailant. He was staring at me, too. He was a young fellow, well\r\ndressed, and haggard beyond belief.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know anything about a bag,\" I persisted, \"but if you will give\r\nme your word there was nothing in it belonging to this house, I will\r\ntake you in and let you look for it.\"\r\n\r\nThe next moment he had lowered the revolver and clutched my arm.\r\n\r\n\"Who in the devil's name _are_ you?\" he asked wildly.\r\n\r\nI think the thing dawned on us both at the same moment.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Knox,\" I said coolly, feeling for my handkerchief--my head\r\nwas bleeding from a cut over the ear--\"John Knox.\"\r\n\r\n\"Knox!\" Instead of showing relief; his manner showed greater\r\nconsternation than ever. He snatched the candle from me and, holding it\r\nup, searched my face. \"Then--good God--where is my traveling-bag?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have something in my head where you hit me,\" I said. \"Perhaps that is\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nBut my sarcasm was lost on him.\r\n\r\n\"I am Harry Wardrop,\" he said, \"and I have been robbed, Mr. Knox. I was\r\ntrying to get in the house without waking the family, and when I came\r\nback here to the front door, where I had left my valise, it was gone. I\r\nthought you were the thief when you came out, and--we've lost all this\r\ntime. Somebody has followed me and robbed me!\"\r\n\r\n\"What was in the bag?\" I asked, stepping to the edge of the porch and\r\nlooking around, with the help of the candle.\r\n\r\n\"Valuable papers,\" he said shortly. He seemed to be dazed and at a loss\r\nwhat to do next. We had both instinctively kept our voices low.\r\n\r\n\"You are certain you left it here?\" I asked. The thing seemed incredible\r\nin the quiet and peace of that neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\"Where you are standing.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more I began a desultory search, going down the steps and looking\r\namong the cannas that bordered the porch. Something glistened beside the\r\nstep, and stooping down I discovered a small brown leather\r\ntraveling-bag, apparently quite new.\r\n\r\n\"Here it is,\" I said, not so gracious as I might have been; I had\r\nsuffered considerably for that traveling-bag. The sight of it restored\r\nWardrop's poise at once. His twitching features relaxed.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, I'm glad to see it,\" he said. \"I can't explain,\r\nbut--tremendous things were depending on that bag, Mr. Knox. I don't\r\nknow how to apologize to you; I must have nearly brained you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did,\" I said grimly, and gave him the bag. The moment he took it I\r\nknew there was something wrong; he hurried into the house and lighted\r\nthe library lamp. Then he opened the traveling-bag with shaking fingers.\r\nIt was empty!\r\n\r\nHe stood for a moment, staring incredulously into it. Then he hurled it\r\ndown on the table and turned on me, as I stood beside him.\r\n\r\n\"It's a trick!\" he said furiously. \"You've hidden it somewhere. This is\r\nnot my bag. You've substituted one just like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a fool,\" I retorted. \"How could I substitute an empty satchel\r\nfor yours when up to fifteen minutes ago I had never seen you or your\r\ngrip either? Use a little common sense. Some place to-night you have put\r\ndown that bag, and some clever thief has substituted a similar one. It's\r\nan old trick.\"\r\n\r\nHe dropped into a chair and buried his face in his hands.\r\n\r\n\"It's impossible,\" he said after a pause, while he seemed to be going\r\nover, minute by minute, the events of the night. \"I was followed, as\r\nfar as that goes, in Plattsburg. Two men watched me from the minute\r\nI got there, on Tuesday; I changed my hotel, and for all of\r\nyesterday--Wednesday, that is--I felt secure enough. But on my way to\r\nthe train I felt that I was under surveillance again, and by turning\r\nquickly I came face to face with one of the men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you know him?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I thought he was a detective, you know I've had a lot of that sort\r\nof thing lately, with election coming on. He didn't get on the train,\r\nhowever.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the other one may have done so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the other one may. The thing I don't understand is this, Mr. Knox.\r\nWhen we drew in at Bellwood Station I distinctly remember opening the\r\nbag and putting my newspaper and railroad schedule inside. It was the\r\nright bag then; my clothing was in it, and my brushes.\"\r\n\r\nI had been examining the empty bag as he talked.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you put your railroad schedule?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"In the leather pocket at the side.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is here,\" I said, drawing out the yellow folder. For a moment my\r\ncompanion looked almost haunted. He pressed his hands to his head and\r\nbegan to pace the room like a crazy man.\r\n\r\n\"The whole thing is impossible. I tell you, that valise was heavy when I\r\nwalked up from the station. I changed it from one hand to the other\r\nbecause of the weight. When I got here I set it down on the edge of the\r\nporch and tried the door. When I found it locked--\"\r\n\r\n\"But it wasn't locked,\" I broke in. \"When I came down-stairs to look for\r\na burglar, I found it open at least an inch.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped in his pacing up and down, and looked at me curiously.\r\n\r\n\"We're both crazy, then,\" he asserted gravely. \"I tell you, I tried\r\nevery way I knew to unlock that door, and could hear the chain rattling.\r\nUnlocked! You don't know the way this house is fastened up at night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, it was unlocked when I came down.\"\r\n\r\nWe were so engrossed that neither of us had heard steps on the stairs.\r\nThe sound of a smothered exclamation from the doorway caused us both to\r\nturn suddenly. Standing there, in a loose gown of some sort, very much\r\nsurprised and startled, was Margery Fleming. Wardrop pulled himself\r\ntogether at once. As for me, I knew what sort of figure I cut, my collar\r\nstained with blood, a lump on my forehead that felt as big as a\r\ndoor-knob, and no shoes.\r\n\r\n\"What _is_ the matter?\" she asked uncertainly. \"I heard such queer\r\nnoises, and I thought some one had broken into the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Wardrop was trying to break in,\" I explained, \"and I heard him and\r\ncame down. On the way I had a bloody encounter with an open door, in\r\nwhich I came out the loser.\"\r\n\r\nI don't think she quite believed me. She looked from my swollen head to\r\nthe open bag, and then to Wardrop's pale face. Then I think, woman-like,\r\nshe remembered the two great braids that hung over her shoulders and\r\nthe dressing-gown she wore, for she backed precipitately into the hall.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad that's all it is,\" she called back cautiously, and we could\r\nhear her running up the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"You'd better go to bed,\" Wardrop said, picking up his hat. \"I'm going\r\ndown to the station. There's no train out of here between midnight and a\r\nflag train at four-thirty A. M. It's not likely to be of any use, but I\r\nwant to see who goes on that train.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is only half past two,\" I said, glancing at my watch. \"We might look\r\naround outside first.\"\r\n\r\nThe necessity for action made him welcome any suggestion. Reticent as he\r\nwas, his feverish excitement made me think that something vital hung on\r\nthe recovery of the contents of that Russia leather bag. We found a\r\nlantern somewhere in the back of the house, and together we went over\r\nthe grounds. It did not take long, and we found nothing.\r\n\r\nAs I look back on that night, the key to what had passed and to much\r\nthat was coming was so simple, so direct--and yet we missed it entirely.\r\nNor, when bigger things developed, and Hunter's trained senses were\r\nbrought into play, did he do much better. It was some time before we\r\nlearned the true inwardness of the events of that night.\r\n\r\nAt five o'clock in the morning Wardrop came back exhausted and\r\nnerveless. No one had taken the four-thirty; the contents of the bag\r\nwere gone, probably beyond recall. I put my dented candlestick back on\r\nthe mantel, and prepared for a little sleep, blessing the deafness of\r\nold age which had enabled the Maitland ladies to sleep through it all. I\r\ntried to forget the queer events of the night, but the throbbing of my\r\nhead kept me awake, and through it all one question obtruded itself--who\r\nhad unlocked the front door and left it open?\r\n\nI was almost unrecognizable when I looked at myself in the mirror the\r\nnext morning, preparatory to dressing for breakfast. My nose boasted a\r\nnew arch, like the back of an angry cat, making my profile Roman and\r\nferocious, and the lump on my forehead from the chair was swollen,\r\nglassy and purple. I turned my back to the mirror and dressed in\r\nwrathful irritation and my yesterday's linen.\r\n\r\nMiss Fleming was in the breakfast-room when I got down, standing at a\r\nwindow, her back to me. I have carried with me, during all the months\r\nsince that time, a mental picture of her as she stood there, in a pink\r\nmorning frock of some sort. But only the other day, having mentioned\r\nthis to her, she assured me that the frock was blue, that she didn't\r\nhave a pink garment at the time this story opens and that if she did she\r\npositively didn't have it on. And having thus flouted my eye for color,\r\nshe maintains that she did _not_ have her back to me, for she\r\ndistinctly saw my newly-raised bridge as I came down the stairs. So I\r\namend this. Miss Fleming in a blue frock was facing the door when I went\r\ninto the breakfast-room. Of one thing I am certain. She came forward and\r\nheld out her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning,\" she said. \"What a terrible face!\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't mine,\" I replied meekly. \"My own face is beneath these\r\nexcrescences. I tried to cover the bump on my forehead with French\r\nchalk, but it only accentuated the thing, like snow on a mountain top.\"\r\n\r\n\"'The purple peaks of Darien,'\" she quoted, pouring me my coffee. \"Do\r\nyou know, I feel so much better since you have taken hold of things.\r\nAunt Letitia thinks you are wonderful.\"\r\n\r\nI thought ruefully of the failure of my first attempt to play the\r\nsleuth, and I disclaimed any right to Miss Letitia's high opinion of me.\r\nFrom my dogging the watchman to the police station, to Delia and her\r\nnote, was a short mental step.\r\n\r\n\"Before any one comes down, Miss Fleming,\" I said, \"I want to ask a\r\nquestion or two. What was the name of the maid who helped you search\r\nthe house that night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Annie.\"\r\n\r\n\"What other maids did you say there were?\"\r\n\r\n\"Delia and Rose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know anything about them? Where they came from, or where they\r\nwent?\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled a little.\r\n\r\n\"What does one know about new servants?\" she responded. \"They bring you\r\nreferences, but references are the price most women pay to get rid of\r\ntheir servants without a fuss. Rose was fat and old, but Delia was\r\npretty. I thought she rather liked Carter.\"\r\n\r\nCarter as well as Shields, the policeman. I put Miss Delia down as a\r\nflirt.\r\n\r\n\"And you have no idea where Carter went?\"\r\n\r\n\"None.\"\r\n\r\nWardrop came in then, and we spoke of other things. The two elderly\r\nladies it seemed had tea and toast in their rooms when they wakened, and\r\nthe three of us breakfasted together. But conversation languished with\r\nWardrop's appearance; he looked haggard and worn, avoided Miss\r\nFleming's eyes, and after ordering eggs instead of his chop, looked at\r\nhis watch and left without touching anything.\r\n\r\n\"I want to get the nine-thirty, Margie,\" he said, coming back with his\r\nhat in his hand. \"I may not be out to dinner. Tell Miss Letitia, will\r\nyou?\" He turned to go, but on second thought came back to me and held\r\nout his hand.\r\n\r\n\"I may not see you again,\" he began.\r\n\r\n\"Not if I see you first,\" I interrupted. He glanced at my mutilated\r\nfeatures and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"I have made you a Maitland,\" he said. \"I didn't think that anything but\r\na prodigal Nature could duplicate Miss Letitia's nose! I'm honestly\r\nsorry, Mr. Knox, and if you do not want Miss Jane at that bump with a\r\ncold silver knife and some butter, you'd better duck before she comes\r\ndown. Good-by, Margie.\"\r\n\r\nI think the girl was as much baffled as I was by the change in his\r\nmanner when he spoke to her. His smile faded and he hardly met her eyes:\r\nI thought that his aloofness puzzled rather than hurt her. When the\r\nhouse door had closed behind him, she dropped her chin in her hand and\r\nlooked across the table.\r\n\r\n\"You did not tell me the truth last night, Mr. Knox,\" she said. \"I have\r\nnever seen Harry look like that. Something has happened to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was robbed of his traveling-bag,\" I explained, on Fred's theory that\r\nhalf a truth is better than a poor lie. \"It's a humiliating experience,\r\nI believe. A man will throw away thousands, or gamble them away, with\r\nmore equanimity than he'll see some one making off with his hair brushes\r\nor his clean collars.\"\r\n\r\n\"His traveling-bag!\" she repeated scornfully. \"Mr. Knox, something has\r\nhappened to my father, and you and Harry are hiding it from me.\"\r\n\r\n\"On my honor, it is nothing of the sort,\" I hastened to assure her. \"I\r\nsaw him for only a few minutes, just long enough for him to wreck my\r\nappearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did not speak of father?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nShe got up and crossing to the wooden mantel, put her arms upon it and\r\nleaned her head against them. \"I wanted to ask him,\" she said drearily,\r\n\"but I am afraid to. Suppose he doesn't know and I should tell him! He\r\nwould go to Mr. Schwartz at once, and Mr. Schwartz is treacherous. The\r\npapers would get it, too.\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes filled with tears, and I felt as awkward as a man always does\r\nwhen a woman begins to cry. If he knows her well enough he can go over\r\nand pat her on the shoulder and assure her it is going to be all right.\r\nIf he does not know her, and there are two maiden aunts likely to come\r\nin at any minute, he sits still, as I did, and waits until the storm\r\nclears.\r\n\r\nMiss Margery was not long in emerging from her handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't sleep much,\" she explained, dabbing at her eyes, \"and I am\r\nnervous, anyhow. Mr. Knox, are you sure it was only Harry trying to get\r\ninto the house last night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only Harry,\" I repeated. \"If Mr. Wardrop's attempt to get into the\r\nhouse leaves me in this condition, what would a real burglar have done\r\nto me!\"\r\n\r\nShe was too intent to be sympathetic over my disfigured face.\r\n\r\n\"There was some one moving about up-stairs not long before I came down,\"\r\nshe said slowly.\r\n\r\n\"You heard me; I almost fell down the stairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you brush past my door, and strike the knob?\" she demanded.\r\n\r\n\"No, I was not near any door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" triumphantly. \"Some one did. Not only that, but they were\r\nin the store-room on the floor above. I could hear one person and\r\nperhaps two, going from one side of the room to the other and back\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"You heard a goblin quadrille. First couple forward and back,\" I said\r\nfacetiously.\r\n\r\n\"I heard real footsteps--unmistakable ones. The maids sleep back on the\r\nsecond floor, and--don't tell me it was rats. There are no rats in my\r\nAunt Letitia's house.\"\r\n\r\nI was more impressed than I cared to show. I found I had a half hour\r\nbefore train time, and as we were neither of us eating anything, I\r\nsuggested that we explore the upper floor of the house. I did it, I\r\nexplained, not because I expected to find anything, but because I was\r\nsure we would not.\r\n\r\nWe crept past the two closed doors behind which the ladies Maitland were\r\npresumably taking out their crimps and taking in their tea. Then up a\r\nnarrow, obtrusively clean stairway to the upper floor.\r\n\r\nIt was an old-fashioned, sloping-roofed attic, with narrow windows and a\r\nbare floor. At one end a door opened into a large room, and in there\r\nwere the family trunks of four generations of Maitlands. One on another\r\nthey were all piled there--little hair trunks, squab-topped trunks, huge\r\nSaratogas--of the period when the two maiden ladies were in their late\r\nteens--and there were handsome, modern trunks, too. For Miss Fleming's\r\nsatisfaction I made an examination of the room, but it showed nothing.\r\nThere was little or no dust to have been disturbed; the windows were\r\nclosed and locked.\r\n\r\nIn the main attic were two step-ladders, some curtains drying on frames\r\nand an old chest of drawers with glass knobs and the veneering broken in\r\nplaces. One of the drawers stood open, and inside could be seen a red\r\nand white patchwork quilt, and a grayish thing that looked like flannel\r\nand smelled to heaven of camphor. We gave up finally, and started down.\r\n\r\nPart way down the attic stairs Margery stopped, her eyes fixed on the\r\nwhite-scrubbed rail. Following her gaze, I stopped, too, and I felt a\r\nsort of chill go over me. No spot or blemish, no dirty finger print\r\nmarked the whiteness of that stair rail, except in one place. On it,\r\nclear and distinct, every line of the palm showing, was the reddish\r\nimprint of a hand!\r\n\r\nMargery did not speak; she had turned very white, and closed her eyes,\r\nbut she was not faint. When the first revulsion had passed, I reached\r\nover and touched the stain. It was quite dry, of course, but it was\r\nstill reddish-brown; another hour or two would see it black. It was\r\nevidently fresh--Hunter said afterward it must have been about six hours\r\nold, and as things transpired, he was right. The stain showed a hand\r\nsomewhat short and broad, with widened finger-tips; marked in ink, it\r\nwould not have struck me so forcibly, perhaps, but there, its ugly red\r\nagainst the white wood, it seemed to me to be the imprint of a brutal,\r\nmurderous hand.\r\n\r\nMargery was essentially feminine.\r\n\r\n\"What did I tell you?\" she asked. \"Some one was in this house last\r\nnight; I heard them distinctly. There must have been two, and they\r\nquarreled--\" she shuddered.\r\n\r\nWe went on down-stairs into the quiet and peace of the dining-room\r\nagain. I got some hot coffee for Margery, for she looked shaken, and\r\nfound I had missed my train.\r\n\r\n\"I am beginning to think I am being pursued by a malicious spirit,\" she\r\nsaid, trying to smile. \"I came away from home because people got into\r\nthe house at night and left queer signs of their visits, and now, here\r\nat Bellwood, where nothing _ever_ happens, the moment I arrive things\r\nbegin to occur. And--just as it was at home--the house was so well\r\nlocked last night.\"\r\n\r\nI did not tell her of the open hall door, just as I had kept from her\r\nthe fact that only the contents of Harry Wardrop's bag had been taken.\r\nThat it had all been the work of one person, and that that person,\r\nhaving in some way access to the house, had also stolen the pearls, was\r\nnow my confident belief.\r\n\r\nI looked at Bella--the maid--as she moved around the dining-room; her\r\nstolid face was not even intelligent; certainly not cunning. Heppie,\r\nthe cook and only other servant, was partly blind and her horizon was\r\nthe diameter of her largest kettle. No--it had not been a servant, this\r\nmysterious intruder who passed the Maitland silver on the sideboard\r\nwithout an attempt to take it, and who floundered around an attic at\r\nnight, in search of nothing more valuable than patchwork quilts and\r\nwinter flannels. It is strange to look back and think how quietly we sat\r\nthere; that we could see nothing but burglary--or an attempt at it--in\r\nwhat we had found.\r\n\r\nIt must have been after nine o'clock when Bella came running into the\r\nroom. Ordinarily a slow and clumsy creature, she almost flew. She had a\r\ntray in her hand, and the dishes were rattling and threatening overthrow\r\nat every step. She brought up against a chair, and a cup went flying.\r\nThe breaking of a cup must have been a serious offense in Miss Letitia\r\nMaitland's house, but Bella took no notice whatever of it.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Jane,\" she gasped, \"Miss Jane, she's--she's--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurt!\" Margery exclaimed, rising and clutching at the table for\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\"No. Gone--she's gone! She's been run off with!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" I said, seeing Margery's horrified face. \"Don't come in here\r\nwith such a story. If Miss Jane is not in her room, she is somewhere\r\nelse, that's all.\"\r\n\r\nBella stooped and gathered up the broken cup, her lips moving. Margery\r\nhad recovered herself. She made Bella straighten and explain.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean--she is not in her room?\" she asked incredulously. \"Isn't\r\nshe somewhere around the house?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go up and look at the room,\" the girl replied, and, with Margery\r\nleading, we ran up the stairs.\r\n\r\nMiss Jane's room was empty. From somewhere near Miss Letitia could be\r\nheard lecturing Hepsibah about putting too much butter on the toast. Her\r\nhigh voice, pitched for Heppie's old ears, rasped me. Margery closed the\r\ndoor, and we surveyed the room together.\r\n\r\nThe bed had been occupied; its coverings had been thrown back, as if\r\nits occupant had risen hurriedly. The room itself was in a state of\r\nconfusion; a rocker lay on its side, and Miss Jane's clothing, folded as\r\nshe had taken it off, had slid off on to the floor. Her shoes stood\r\nneatly at the foot of the bed, and a bottle of toilet vinegar had been\r\nupset, pouring a stream over the marble top of the dresser and down on\r\nto the floor. Over the high wooden mantel the Maitland who had been\r\ngovernor of the state years ago hung at a waggish angle, and a clock had\r\nbeen pushed aside and stopped at half-past one.\r\n\r\nMargery stared around her in bewilderment. Of course, it was not until\r\nlater in the day that I saw all the details. My first impression was of\r\nconfusion and disorder: the room seemed to have been the scene of a\r\nstruggle. The overturned furniture, the clothes on the floor, the\r\npicture, coupled with the print of the hand on the staircase and Miss\r\nJane's disappearance, all seemed to point to one thing.\r\n\r\nAnd as if to prove it conclusively, Margery picked up Miss Jane's new\r\nlace cap from the floor. It was crumpled and spotted with blood.\r\n\r\n\"She has been killed,\" Margery said, in a choking voice. \"Killed, and\r\nshe had not an enemy in the world!\"\r\n\r\n\"But where is she?\" I asked stupidly.\r\n\r\nMargery had more presence of mind than I had; I suppose it is because\r\nwoman's courage is mental and man's physical, that in times of great\r\nstrain women always make the better showing. While I was standing in the\r\nmiddle of the room, staring at the confusion around me, Margery was\r\nalready on her knees, looking under the high, four-post bed. Finding\r\nnothing there she went to the closet. It was undisturbed. Pathetic rows\r\nof limp black dresses and on the shelves two black crepe bonnets were\r\nmute reminders of the little old lady. But there was nothing else in the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\"Call Robert, the gardener,\" Margery said quickly, \"and have him help\r\nyou search the grounds and cellars. I will take Bella and go through the\r\nhouse. Above everything, keep it from Aunt Letitia as long as possible.\"\r\n\r\nI locked the door into the disordered room, and with my head whirling, I\r\nwent to look for Robert.\r\n\r\nIt takes a short time to search an acre of lawn and shrubbery. There was\r\nno trace of the missing woman anywhere outside the house, and from\r\nBella, as she sat at the foot of the front stairs with her apron over\r\nher head, I learned in a monosyllable that nothing had been found in the\r\nhouse. Margery was with Miss Letitia, and from the excited conversation\r\nI knew she was telling her--not harrowing details, but that Miss Jane\r\nhad disappeared during the night.\r\n\r\nThe old lady was inclined to scoff at first.\r\n\r\n\"Look in the fruit closet in the store-room,\" I heard her say. \"She's\r\nlet the spring lock shut on her twice; she was black in the face the\r\nlast time we found her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did look; she's not there,\" Margery screamed at her.\r\n\r\n\"Then she's out looking for stump water to take that wart off her neck.\r\nShe said yesterday she was going for some.\"\r\n\r\n\"But her clothes are all here,\" Margery persisted. \"We think some one\r\nmust have got in the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"If all her clothes are there she's been sleep-walking,\" Miss Letitia\r\nsaid calmly. \"We used to have to tie her by a cord around her ankle and\r\nfasten it to the bedpost. When she tried to get up the cord would pull\r\nand wake her.\"\r\n\r\nI think after a time, however, some of Margery's uneasiness communicated\r\nitself to the older woman. She finished dressing, and fumed when we told\r\nher we had locked Miss Jane's door and mislaid the key. Finally, Margery\r\ngot her settled in the back parlor with some peppermints and her\r\nknitting; she had a feeling, she said, that Jane had gone after the\r\nstump water and lost her way, and I told Margery to keep her in that\r\nstate of mind as long as she could.\r\n\r\nI sent for Hunter that morning and he came at three o'clock. I took him\r\nthrough the back entrance to avoid Miss Letitia. I think he had been\r\nskeptical until I threw open the door and showed him the upset chair,\r\nthe old lady's clothing, and the bloodstained lace cap. His examination\r\nwas quick and thorough. He took a crumpled sheet of note paper out of\r\nthe waste-basket and looked at it, then he stuffed it in his pocket. He\r\nsniffed the toilet water, called Margery and asked her if any clothing\r\nwas missing, and on receiving a negative answer asked if any shawls or\r\nwraps were gone from the halls or other rooms. Margery reported nothing\r\nmissing.\r\n\r\nBefore he left the room, Hunter went back and moved the picture which\r\nhad been disturbed over the mantel. What he saw made him get a chair\r\nand, standing on it, take the picture from its nail. Thus exposed, the\r\nwall showed an opening about a foot square, and perhaps eighteen inches\r\ndeep. A metal door, opening in, was unfastened and ajar, and just inside\r\nwas a copy of a recent sentimental novel and a bottle of some sort of\r\ncomplexion cream. In spite of myself, I smiled; it was so typical of the\r\ndear old lady, with the heart of a girl and a skin that was losing its\r\nroses. But there was something else in the receptacle, something that\r\nmade Margery Fleming draw in her breath sharply, and made Hunter raise\r\nhis eyebrows a little and glance at me. The something was a scrap of\r\nunruled white paper, and on it the figures eleven twenty-two!\r\n\nHarry Wardrop came back from the city at four o'clock, while Hunter was\r\nin the midst of his investigation. I met him in the hall and told him\r\nwhat had happened, and with this new apprehension added to the shock of\r\nthe night before, he looked as though his nerves were ready to snap.\r\n\r\nWardrop was a man of perhaps twenty-seven, as tall as I, although not so\r\nheavy, with direct blue eyes and fair hair; altogether a manly and\r\nprepossessing sort of fellow. I was not surprised that Margery Fleming\r\nhad found him attractive--he had the blond hair and off-hand manner that\r\nwomen seem to like. I am dark, myself.\r\n\r\nHe seemed surprised to find Hunter there, and not particularly pleased,\r\nbut he followed us to the upper floor and watched silently while Hunter\r\nwent over the two rooms. Beside the large chest of drawers in the main\r\nattic Hunter found perhaps half a dozen drops of blood, and on the edge\r\nof the open drawer there were traces of more. In the inner room two\r\ntrunks had been moved out nearly a foot, as he found by the faint dust\r\nthat had been under them. With the stain on the stair rail, that was all\r\nhe discovered, and it was little enough. Then he took out his note-book\r\nand there among the trunks we had a little seance of our own, in which\r\nHunter asked questions, and whoever could do so answered them.\r\n\r\n\"Have you a pencil or pen, Mr. Knox?\" he asked me, but I had none.\r\nWardrop felt his pockets, with no better success.\r\n\r\n\"I have lost my fountain pen somewhere around the house to-day,\" he said\r\nirritably. \"Here's a pencil--not much of one.\"\r\n\r\nHunter began his interrogations.\r\n\r\n\"How old was Miss Maitland--Miss Jane, I mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sixty-five,\" from Margery.\r\n\r\n\"She had always seemed rational? Not eccentric, or childish?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all; the sanest woman I ever knew.\" This from Wardrop.\r\n\r\n\"Has she ever, to your knowledge, received any threatening letters?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never in all her life,\" from both of them promptly.\r\n\r\n\"You heard sounds, you say, Miss Fleming. At what time?\"\r\n\r\n\"About half-past one or perhaps a few minutes later. The clock struck\r\ntwo while I was still awake and nervous.\"\r\n\r\n\"This person who was walking through the attics here--would you say it\r\nwas a heavy person? A man, I mean?\"\r\n\r\nMargery stopped to think.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said finally. \"It was very stealthy, but I think it was a\r\nman's step.\"\r\n\r\n\"You heard no sound of a struggle? No voices? No screams?\"\r\n\r\n\"None at all,\" she said positively. And I added my quota.\r\n\r\n\"There could have been no such sounds,\" I said. \"I sat in my room and\r\nsmoked until a quarter to two. I heard nothing until then, when I heard\r\nMr. Wardrop trying to get into the house. I went down to admit him,\r\nand--I found the front door open about an inch.\"\r\n\r\nHunter wheeled on Wardrop.\r\n\r\n\"A quarter to two?\" he asked. \"You were coming home from--the city?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, from the station.\"\r\n\r\nHunter watched him closely.\r\n\r\n\"The last train gets in here at twelve-thirty,\" he said slowly. \"Does it\r\nalways take you an hour and a quarter to walk the three squares to the\r\nhouse?\"\r\n\r\nWardrop flushed uneasily, and I could see Margery's eyes dilate with\r\namazement. As for me, I could only stare.\r\n\r\n\"I did not come directly home,\" he said, almost defiantly.\r\n\r\nHunter's voice was as smooth as silk.\r\n\r\n\"Then--will you be good enough to tell me where you did go?\" he asked.\r\n\"I have reasons for wanting to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn your reasons--I beg your pardon, Margery. Look here, Mr. Hunter,\r\ndo you think I would hurt a hair of that old lady's head? Do you think I\r\ncame here last night and killed her, or whatever it is that has happened\r\nto her? And then went out and tried to get in again through the window?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not necessarily,\" Hunter said, unruffled. \"It merely occurred to me\r\nthat we have at least an hour of your time last night, while this thing\r\nwas going on, to account for. However, we can speak of that later. I am\r\npractically certain of one thing, Miss Maitland is not dead, or was not\r\ndead when she was taken away from this house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Taken away!\" Margery repeated. \"Then you think she was kidnapped?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is possible. It's a puzzling affair all through. You are\r\ncertain there are no closets or unused rooms where, if there had been a\r\nmurder, the body could be concealed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never heard of any,\" Margery said, but I saw Wardrop's face change on\r\nthe instant. He said nothing, however, but stood frowning at the floor,\r\nwith his hands deep in his coat pockets.\r\n\r\nMargery was beginning to show the effect of the long day's strain; she\r\nbegan to cry a little, and with an air of proprietorship that I\r\nresented, somehow, Wardrop went over to her.\r\n\r\n\"You are going to lie down, Margery,\" he said, holding out his hand to\r\nhelp her up. \"Mrs. Mellon will come over to Aunt Letitia, and you must\r\nget some sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sleep!\" she said with scorn, as he helped her to her feet. \"Sleep, when\r\nthings like this are occurring! Father first, and now dear old Aunt\r\nJane! Harry, do you know where my father is?\"\r\n\r\nHe faced her, as if he had known the question must come and was prepared\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\n\"I know that he is all right, Margery. He has been--out of town. If it\r\nhad not been for something unforeseen that--happened within the last few\r\nhours, he would have been home to-day.\"\r\n\r\nShe drew a long breath of relief.\r\n\r\n\"And Aunt Jane?\" she asked Hunter, from the head of the attic stairs,\r\n\"you do not think she is dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not until we have found something more,\" he answered tactlessly. \"It's\r\nlike where there's smoke there's fire; where there's murder there's a\r\nbody.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they had both gone, Hunter sat down on a trunk and drew out a cigar\r\nthat looked like a bomb.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of it?\" I asked, when he showed no disposition to\r\ntalk.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be damned if I know,\" he responded, looking around for some place\r\nto expectorate and finding none.\r\n\r\n\"The window,\" I suggested, and he went over to it. When he came back he\r\nhad a rather peculiar expression. He sat down and puffed for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"In the first place,\" he began, \"we can take it for granted that, unless\r\nshe was crazy or sleep-walking, she didn't go out in her night-clothes,\r\nand there's nothing of hers missing. She wasn't taken in a carriage,\r\nproviding she was taken at all. There's not a mark of wheels on that\r\ndrive newer than a week, and besides, you say you heard nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" I said positively.\r\n\r\n\"Then, unless she went away in a balloon, where it wouldn't matter what\r\nshe had on, she is still around the premises. It depends on how badly\r\nshe was hurt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure it was she who was hurt?\" I asked. \"That print of a\r\nhand--that is not Miss Jane's.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply Hunter led the way down the stairs to the place where the stain\r\non the stair rail stood out, ugly and distinct. He put his own heavy\r\nhand on the rail just below it.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" he said, \"suppose you grip something very hard, what happens\r\nto your hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"It spreads,\" I acknowledged, seeing what he meant.\r\n\r\n\"Now, look at that stain. Look at the short fingers--why, it's a child's\r\nhand beside mine. The breadth is from pressure. It might be figured out\r\nthis way. The fingers, you notice, point down the stairs. In some way,\r\nlet us say, the burglar, for want of a better name, gets into the house.\r\nHe used a ladder resting against that window by the chest of drawers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ladder!\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there is a pruning ladder there. Now then--he comes down these\r\nstairs, and he has a definite object. He knows of something valuable in\r\nthat cubby hole over the mantel in Miss Jane's room. How does he get in?\r\nThe door into the upper hall is closed and bolted, but the door into the\r\nbath-room is open. From there another door leads into the bedroom, and\r\nit has no bolt--only a key. That kind of a lock is only a three-minutes\r\ndelay, or less. Now then, Miss Maitland was a light sleeper. When she\r\nwakened she was too alarmed to scream; she tried to get to the door and\r\nwas intercepted. Finally she got out the way the intruder got in, and\r\nran along the hall. Every door was locked. In a frenzy she ran up the\r\nattic stairs and was captured up there. Which bears out Miss Margery's\r\nstory of the footsteps back and forward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens, what an awful thing!\" I gasped. \"And I was sitting\r\nsmoking just across the hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"He brings her down the stairs again, probably half dragging her. Once,\r\nshe catches hold of the stair rail, and holds desperately to it, leaving\r\nthe stain here.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why did he bring her down?\" I asked bewildered. \"Why wouldn't he\r\ntake what he was after and get away?\"\r\n\r\nHunter smoked and meditated.\r\n\r\n\"She probably had to get the key of the iron door,\" he suggested. \"It\r\nwas hidden, and time was valuable. If there was a scapegrace member of\r\nthe family, for instance, who knew where the old lady kept money, and\r\nwho needed it badly; who knew all about the house, and who--\"\r\n\r\n\"Fleming!\" I exclaimed, aghast.\r\n\r\n\"Or even our young friend, Wardrop,\" Hunter said quietly. \"He has an\r\nhour to account for. The trying to get in may have been a blind, and how\r\ndo you know that what he says was stolen out of his satchel was not what\r\nhe had just got from the iron box over the mantel in Miss Maitland's\r\nroom?\"\r\n\r\nI was dizzy with trying to follow Hunter's facile imagination. The thing\r\nwe were trying to do was to find the old lady, and, after all, here we\r\nbrought up against the same _impasse_.\r\n\r\n\"Then where is she now?\" I asked. He meditated. He had sat down on the\r\nnarrow stairs, and was rubbing his chin with a thoughtful forefinger.\r\n\"One-thirty, Miss Margery says, when she heard the noise. One-forty-five\r\nwhen you heard Wardrop at the shutters. I tell you, Knox, it is one of\r\ntwo things: either that woman is dead somewhere in this house, or she\r\nran out of the hall door just before you went down-stairs, and in that\r\ncase the Lord only knows where she is. If there is a room anywhere that\r\nwe have not explored--\"\r\n\r\n\"I am inclined to think there is,\" I broke in, thinking of Wardrop's\r\nface a few minutes before. And just then Wardrop himself joined us. He\r\nclosed the door at the foot of the boxed-in staircase, and came quietly\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\"You spoke about an unused room or a secret closet, Mr. Hunter,\" he\r\nsaid, without any resentment in his tone. \"We have nothing so\r\nsensational as that, but the old house is full of queer nooks and\r\ncrannies, and perhaps, in one of them, we might find--\" he stopped and\r\ngulped. Whatever Hunter might think, whatever I might have against Harry\r\nWardrop, I determined then that he had had absolutely nothing to do with\r\nlittle Miss Maitland's strange disappearance.\r\n\r\nThe first place we explored was a closed and walled-in wine-cellar, long\r\nunused, and to which access was gained by a small window in the stone\r\nfoundation of the house. The cobwebs over the window made it practically\r\nan impossible place, but we put Robert, the gardener, through it, in\r\nspite of his protests.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothin' there, I tell you,\" he protested, with one leg over the\r\ncoping. \"God only knows what's down there, after all these years. I've\r\nbeen livin' here with the Miss Maitlands for twenty year, and I ain't\r\nnever been put to goin' down into cellars on the end of a rope.\"\r\n\r\nHe went, because we were three to his one, but he was up again in sixty\r\nseconds, with the announcement that the place was as bare as the top of\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nWe moved every trunk in the store-room, although it would have been a\r\nmoral impossibility for any one to have done it the night before without\r\nrousing the entire family, and were thus able to get to and open a large\r\ncloset, which proved to contain neatly tied and labeled packages of\r\nreligious weeklies, beginning in the sixties.\r\n\r\nThe grounds had been gone over inch by inch, without affording any clue,\r\nand now the three of us faced one another. The day was almost gone, and\r\nwe were exactly where we started. Hunter had sent men through the town\r\nand the adjacent countryside, but no word had come from them. Miss\r\nLetitia had at last succumbed to the suspense and had gone to bed, where\r\nshe lay quietly enough, as is the way with the old, but so mild that she\r\nwas alarming.\r\n\r\nAt five o'clock Hawes called me up from the office and almost tearfully\r\nimplored me to come back and attend to my business. When I said it was\r\nimpossible, I could hear him groan as he hung up the receiver. Hawes is\r\nof the opinion that by keeping fresh magazines in my waiting-room and by\r\npersuading me to the extravagance of Turkish rugs, that he has built my\r\npractice to its present flourishing state. When I left the telephone,\r\nHunter was preparing to go back to town and Wardrop was walking up and\r\ndown the hall. Suddenly Wardrop stopped his uneasy promenade and hailed\r\nthe detective on his way to the door.\r\n\r\n\"By George,\" he exclaimed, \"I forgot to show you the closet under the\r\nattic stairs!\"\r\n\r\nWe hurried up and Wardrop showed us the panel in the hall, which slid to\r\none side when he pushed a bolt under the carpet. The blackness of the\r\ncloset was horrible in its suggestion to me. I stepped back while\r\nHunter struck a match and looked in.\r\n\r\nThe closet was empty.\r\n\r\n\"Better not go in,\" Wardrop said. \"It hasn't been used for years and\r\nit's black with dust. I found it myself and showed it to Miss Jane. I\r\ndon't believe Miss Letitia knows it is here.\"\r\n\r\n\"It hasn't been used for years!\" reflected Hunter, looking around him\r\ncuriously. \"I suppose it has been some time since you were in here, Mr.\r\nWardrop?\"\r\n\r\n\"Several years,\" Wardrop replied carelessly. \"I used to keep contraband\r\nhere in my college days, cigarettes and that sort of thing. I haven't\r\nbeen in it since then.\"\r\n\r\nHunter took his foot off a small object that lay on the floor, and\r\npicking it up, held it out to Wardrop, with a grim smile.\r\n\r\n\"Here is the fountain pen you lost this morning, Mr. Wardrop,\" he said\r\nquietly.\r\n\nWhen Hunter had finally gone at six o'clock, summoned to town on urgent\r\nbusiness, we were very nearly where we had been before he came. He could\r\nonly give us theories, and after all, what we wanted was fact--and Miss\r\nJane. Many things, however, that he had unearthed puzzled me.\r\n\r\nWhy had Wardrop lied about so small a matter as his fountain pen? The\r\ncloset was empty: what object could he have had in saying he had not\r\nbeen in it for years? I found that my belief in his sincerity of the\r\nnight before was going. If he had been lying then, I owed him something\r\nfor a lump on my head that made it difficult for me to wear my hat.\r\n\r\nIt would have been easy enough for him to rob himself, and, if he had an\r\neye for the theatrical, to work out just some such plot. It was even\r\npossible that he had hidden for a few hours in the secret closet the\r\ncontents of the Russia leather bag. But, whatever Wardrop might or\r\nmight not be, he gave me little chance to find out, for he left the\r\nhouse before Hunter did that afternoon, and it was later, and under\r\nstrange circumstances, that I met him again.\r\n\r\nHunter had not told me what was on the paper he had picked out of the\r\nbasket in Miss Jane's room, and I knew he was as much puzzled as I at\r\nthe scrap in the little cupboard, with eleven twenty-two on it. It\r\noccurred to me that it might mean the twenty-second day of the eleventh\r\nmonth, perhaps something that had happened on some momentous,\r\nlong-buried twenty-second of November. But this was May, and the finding\r\nof two slips bearing the same number was too unusual.\r\n\r\nAfter Hunter left I went back to the closet under the upper stairs, and\r\nwith some difficulty got the panel open again. The space inside, perhaps\r\neight feet high at one end and four at the other, was empty. There was a\r\nrow of hooks, as if at some time clothing had been hung there, and a\r\nflat shelf at one end, gray with dust.\r\n\r\nI struck another match and examined the shelf. On its surface were\r\nnumerous scratchings in the dust layer, but at one end, marked out as if\r\ndrawn on a blackboard, was a rectangular outline, apparently that of a\r\nsmallish box, and fresh.\r\n\r\nMy match burned my fingers and I dropped it to the floor, where it\r\nexpired in a sickly blue flame. At the last, however, it died\r\nheroically--like an old man to whom his last hours bring back some of\r\nthe glory of his prime, burning brightly for a second and then fading\r\ninto darkness. The last flash showed me, on the floor of the closet and\r\nwedged between two boards, a small white globule. It did not need\r\nanother match to tell me it was a pearl.\r\n\r\nI dug it out carefully and took it to my room. In the daylight there I\r\nrecognized it as an unstrung pearl of fair size and considerable value.\r\nThere could hardly be a doubt that I had stumbled on one of the stolen\r\ngems; but a pearl was only a pearl to me, after all. I didn't feel any\r\nof the inspirations which fiction detectives experience when they happen\r\non an important clue.\r\n\r\nI lit a cigar and put the pearl on the table in front of me. But no\r\nexplanation formed itself in the tobacco smoke. If Wardrop took the\r\npearls, I kept repeating over and over, if Wardrop took the pearls, who\r\ntook Miss Jane?\r\n\r\nI tried to forget the pearls, and to fathom the connection between Miss\r\nMaitland's disappearance and the absence of her brother-in-law. The\r\nscrap of paper, eleven twenty-two, must connect them, but how? A family\r\nscandal? Dismissed on the instant. There could be nothing that would\r\ntouch the virginal remoteness of that little old lady. Insanity? Well,\r\nMiss Jane might have had a sudden aberration and wandered away, but that\r\nwould leave Fleming out, and the paper dragged him in. A common enemy?\r\n\r\nI smoked and considered for some time over this. An especially malignant\r\nfoe might rob, or even murder, but it was almost ludicrous to think of\r\nhis carrying away by force Miss Jane's ninety pounds of austere flesh.\r\nThe solution, had it not been for the blood-stains, might have been a\r\npeaceful one, leaving out the pearls, altogether, but later developments\r\nshowed that the pearls refused to be omitted. To my mind, however, at\r\nthat time, the issue seemed a double one. I believed that some one,\r\nperhaps Harry Wardrop, had stolen the pearls, hidden them in the secret\r\ncloset, and disposed of them later. I made a note to try to follow up\r\nthe missing pearls.\r\n\r\nThen--I clung to the theory that Miss Maitland had been abducted and was\r\nbeing held for ransom. If I could have found traces of a vehicle of any\r\nsort near the house, I would almost have considered my contention\r\nproved. That any one could have entered the house, intimidated and even\r\nslightly injured the old lady, and taken her quietly out the front door,\r\nwhile I sat smoking in my room with the window open, and Wardrop trying\r\nthe shutters at the side of the house, seemed impossible. Yet there were\r\nthe stains, the confusion, the open front door to prove it.\r\n\r\nBut--and I stuck here--the abductor who would steal an old woman, and\r\ntake her out into the May night without any covering--not even\r\nshoes--clad only in her night-clothes, would run an almost certain risk\r\nof losing his prize by pneumonia. For a second search had shown not an\r\narticle of wearing apparel missing from the house. Even the cedar\r\nchests were undisturbed; not a blanket was gone.\r\n\r\nJust before dinner I made a second round of the grounds, this time\r\nlooking for traces of wheels. I found none near-by, and it occurred to\r\nme that the boldest highwayman would hardly drive up to the door for his\r\nbooty. When I had extended my search to cover the unpaved lane that\r\nseparated the back of the Maitland place from its nearest neighbor, I\r\nwas more fortunate.\r\n\r\nThe morning delivery wagons had made fresh trails, and at first I\r\ndespaired. I sauntered up the lane to the right, however, and about a\r\nhundred feet beyond the boundary hedge I found circular tracks, broad\r\nand deep, where an automobile had backed and turned. The lane was\r\nseparated by high hedges of osage orange from the properties on either\r\nside, and each house in that neighborhood had a drive of its own, which\r\nentered from the main street, circled the house and went out as it came.\r\n\r\nThere was no reason, or, so far as I could see, no legitimate reason,\r\nwhy a car should have stopped there, yet it had stopped and for some\r\ntime. Deeper tracks in the sand at the side of the lane showed that.\r\n\r\nI felt that I had made some progress: I had found where the pearls had\r\nbeen hidden after the theft, and this put Bella out of the question. And\r\nI had found--or thought I had--the way in which Miss Jane had been taken\r\naway from Bellwood.\r\n\r\nI came back past the long rear wing of the house which contained, I\r\npresumed, the kitchen and the other mysterious regions which only women\r\nand architects comprehend. A long porch ran the length of the wing, and\r\nas I passed I heard my name called.\r\n\r\n\"In here in the old laundry,\" Margery's voice repeated, and I retraced\r\nmy steps and went up on the porch. At the very end of the wing,\r\ndismantled, piled at the sides with firewood and broken furniture, was\r\nan old laundry. Its tubs were rusty, its walls mildewed and streaked,\r\nand it exhaled the musty odor of empty houses. On the floor in the\r\nmiddle of the room, undeniably dirty and dishevelled, sat Margery\r\nFleming.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you were never coming,\" she said petulantly. \"I have been\r\nhere alone for an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I never guessed it,\" I apologized. \"I should have been only\r\ntoo glad to come and sit with you.\"\r\n\r\nShe was fumbling with her hair, which threatened to come down any\r\nminute, and which hung, loosely knotted, over one small ear.\r\n\r\n\"I hate to look ridiculous,\" she said sharply, \"and I detest being\r\nlaughed at. I've been crying, and I haven't any handkerchief.\"\r\n\r\nI proffered mine gravely, and she took it. She wiped the dusty streaks\r\noff her cheeks and pinned her hair in a funny knob on top of her head\r\nthat would have made any other woman look like a caricature. But still\r\nshe sat on the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" she said, when she had jabbed the last hair-pin into place and\r\ntucked my handkerchief into her belt, \"if you have been sufficiently\r\namused, perhaps you will help me out of here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Out of where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose I'm sitting here because I like it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have sprained your ankle,\" I said, with sudden alarm.\r\n\r\nIn reply she brushed aside her gown, and for the first time I saw what\r\nhad occurred. She was sitting half over a trap-door in the floor, which\r\nhad closed on her skirts and held her fast.\r\n\r\n\"The wretched thing!\" she wailed. \"And I have called until I am hoarse.\r\nI could shake Heppie! Then I tried to call you mentally. I fixed my mind\r\non you and said over and over, 'Come, please come.' Didn't you feel\r\nanything at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good old trap-door!\" I said. \"I know I was thinking about you, but I\r\nnever suspected the reason. And then to have walked past here twenty\r\nminutes ago! Why didn't you call me then?\" I was tugging at the door,\r\nbut it was fast, with the skirts to hold it tight.\r\n\r\n\"I looked such a fright,\" she explained. \"Can't you pry it up with\r\nsomething?\"\r\n\r\nI tried several things without success, while Margery explained her\r\nplight.\r\n\r\n\"I was sure Robert had not looked carefully in the old wine cellar,\" she\r\nsaid, \"and then I remembered this trap-door opened into it. It was the\r\nonly place we hadn't explored thoroughly. I put a ladder down and\r\nlooked around. Ugh!\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you find?\" I asked, as my third broomstick lever snapped.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing--only I know now where Aunt Letitia's Edwin Booth went to. He\r\nwas a cat,\" she explained, \"and Aunt Letitia made the railroad pay for\r\nkilling him.\"\r\n\r\nI gave up finally and stood back.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't you--er--get out of your garments, and--I could go out and\r\nclose the door,\" I suggested delicately. \"You see you are sitting on the\r\ntrap-door, and--\"\r\n\r\nBut Margery scouted the suggestion with the proper scorn, and demanded a\r\npair of scissors. She cut herself loose with vicious snips, while I\r\nparaphrased the old nursery rhyme, \"She cut her petticoats all around\r\nabout.\" Then she gathered up her outraged garments and fled\r\nprecipitately.\r\n\r\nShe was unusually dignified at dinner. Neither of us cared to eat, and\r\nthe empty places--Wardrop's and Miss Letitia's--Miss Jane's had not been\r\nset--were like skeletons at the board.\r\n\r\nIt was Margery who, after our pretense of a meal, voiced the suspicion I\r\nthink we both felt.\r\n\r\n\"It is a strange time for Harry to go away,\" she said quietly, from the\r\nlibrary window.\r\n\r\n\"He probably has a reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you say it?\" she said suddenly, turning on me. \"I know what\r\nyou think. You believe he only pretended he was robbed!\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be sorry to think anything of the kind,\" I began. But she did\r\nnot allow me to finish.\r\n\r\n\"I saw what you thought,\" she burst out bitterly. \"The detective almost\r\nlaughed in his face. Oh, you needn't think I don't know: I saw him last\r\nnight, and the woman too. He brought her right to the gate. You treat me\r\nlike a child, all of you!\"\r\n\r\nIn sheer amazement I was silent. So a new character had been introduced\r\ninto the play--a woman, too!\r\n\r\n\"You were not the only person, Mr. Knox, who could not sleep last\r\nnight,\" she went on. \"Oh, I know a great many things. I know about the\r\npearls, and what you think about them, and I know more than that, I--\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped then. She had said more than she intended to, and all at\r\nonce her bravado left her, and she looked like a frightened child. I\r\nwent over to her and took one trembling hand.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you didn't know all those things,\" I said. \"But since you do,\r\nwon't you let me share the burden? The only reason I am still here\r\nis--on your account.\"\r\n\r\nI had a sort of crazy desire to take her in my arms and comfort her,\r\nWardrop or no Wardrop. But at that moment, luckily for me, perhaps, Miss\r\nLetitia's shrill old voice came from the stairway.\r\n\r\n\"Get out of my way, Heppie,\" she was saying tartly. \"I'm not on my\r\ndeath-bed yet, not if I know it. Where's Knox?\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon I obediently went out and helped Miss Letitia into the room.\r\n\r\n\"I think I know where Jane is,\" she said, putting down her cane with a\r\njerk. \"I don't know why I didn't think about it before. She's gone to\r\nget her new teeth; she's been talkin' of it for a month. Not but what\r\nher old teeth would have done well enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"She would hardly go in the middle of the night,\" I returned. \"She was a\r\nvery timid woman, wasn't she?\"\r\n\r\n\"She wasn't raised right,\" Miss Letitia said with a shake of her head.\r\n\"She's the baby, and the youngest's always spoiled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you thought that this might be more than it appears to be?\" I was\r\nfeeling my way: she was a very old woman. \"It--for instance, it might be\r\nabduction, kidnapping--for a ransom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ransom!\" Miss Letitia snapped. \"Mr. Knox, my father made his money by\r\nworking hard for it: I haven't wasted it--not that I know of. And if\r\nJane Maitland was fool enough to be abducted, she'll stay a while before\r\nI pay anything for her. It looks to me as if this detective business was\r\ngoing to be expensive, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nMy excuse for dwelling with such attention to detail on the preliminary\r\nstory, the disappearance of Miss Jane Maitland and the peculiar\r\ncircumstances surrounding it, will have to find its justification in the\r\nevents that followed it. Miss Jane herself, and the solution of that\r\nmystery, solved the even more tragic one in which we were about to be\r\ninvolved. I say _we_, because it was borne in on me at about that time,\r\nthat the things that concerned Margery Fleming must concern me\r\nhenceforth, whether I willed it so or otherwise. For the first time in\r\nmy life a woman's step on the stair was like no other sound in the\r\nworld.\r\n\nAt nine o'clock that night things remained about the same. The man\r\nHunter had sent to investigate the neighborhood and the country just\r\noutside of the town, came to the house about eight, and reported\r\n\"nothing discovered.\" Miss Letitia went to bed early, and Margery took\r\nher up-stairs.\r\n\r\nHunter called me by telephone from town.\r\n\r\n\"Can you take the nine-thirty up?\" he asked. I looked at my watch.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think so. Is there anything new?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet; there may be. Take a cab at the station and come to the corner\r\nof Mulberry Street and Park Lane. You'd better dismiss your cab there\r\nand wait for me.\"\r\n\r\nI sent word up-stairs by Bella, who was sitting in the kitchen, her\r\nheavy face sodden with grief, and taking my hat and raincoat--it was\r\nraining a light spring drizzle--I hurried to the station. In\r\ntwenty-four minutes I was in the city, and perhaps twelve minutes more\r\nsaw me at the designated corner, with my cab driving away and the rain\r\ndropping off the rim of my hat and splashing on my shoulders.\r\n\r\nI found a sort of refuge by standing under the wooden arch of a gate,\r\nand it occurred to me that, for all my years in the city, this\r\nparticular neighborhood was altogether strange to me. Two blocks away,\r\nin any direction, I would have been in familiar territory again.\r\n\r\nBack of me a warehouse lifted six or seven gloomy stories to the sky.\r\nThe gate I stood in was evidently the entrance to its yard, and in fact,\r\nsome uncomfortable movement of mine just then struck the latch, and\r\nalmost precipitated me backward by its sudden opening. Beyond was a yard\r\nfull of shadowy wheels and packing cases; the street lights did not\r\npenetrate there, and with an uneasy feeling that almost anything, in\r\nthis none too savory neighborhood, might be waiting there, I struck a\r\nmatch and looked at my watch. It was twenty minutes after ten. Once a\r\nman turned the corner and came toward me, his head down, his long\r\nulster flapping around his legs. Confident that it was Hunter, I stepped\r\nout and touched him on the arm. He wheeled instantly, and in the light\r\nwhich shone on his face, I saw my error.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me,\" I mumbled, \"I mistook my man.\"\r\n\r\nHe went on again without speaking, only pulling his soft hat down lower\r\nover his face. I looked after him until he turned the next corner, and I\r\nknew I had not been mistaken; it was Wardrop.\r\n\r\nThe next minute Hunter appeared, from the same direction, and we walked\r\nquickly together. I told him who the man just ahead had been, and he\r\nnodded without surprise. But before we turned the next corner he\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever hear of the White Cat?\" he asked. \"Little political club?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm a member of it,\" he went on rapidly. \"It's run by the city ring, or\r\nrather it runs itself. Be a good fellow while you're there, and keep\r\nyour eyes open. It's a queer joint.\"\r\n\r\nThe corner we turned found us on a narrow, badly paved street. The\r\nbroken windows of the warehouse still looked down on us, and across the\r\nstreet was an ice factory, with two deserted wagons standing along the\r\ncurb. As well as I could see for the darkness, a lumber yard stretched\r\nbeyond the warehouse, its piles of boards giving off in the rain the\r\naromatic odor of fresh pine.\r\n\r\nAt a gate in the fence beyond the warehouse Hunter stopped. It was an\r\nordinary wooden gate and it opened with a thumb latch. Beyond stretched\r\na long, narrow, brick-paved alleyway, perhaps three feet wide, and\r\nlighted by the merest glimmer of a light ahead. Hunter went on\r\nregardless of puddles in the brick paving, and I stumbled after him. As\r\nwe advanced, I could see that the light was a single electric bulb, hung\r\nover a second gate. While Hunter fumbled for a key in his pocket, I had\r\ntime to see that this gate had a Yale lock, was provided, at the side,\r\nwith an electric bell button, and had a letter slot cut in it.\r\n\r\nHunter opened the gate and preceded me through it. The gate swung to and\r\nclicked behind me. After the gloom of the passageway, the small\r\nbrick-paved yard seemed brilliant with lights. Two wires were strung\r\nits length, dotted with many electric lamps. In a corner a striped tent\r\nstood out in grotesque relief; it seemed to be empty, and the weather\r\nwas an easy explanation. From the two-story house beyond there came\r\nsuddenly a burst of piano music and a none too steady masculine voice.\r\nHunter turned to me, with his foot on the wooden steps.\r\n\r\n\"Above everything else,\" he warned, \"keep your temper. Nobody gives a\r\nhang in here whether you're the mayor of the town, the champion\r\npool-player of the first ward, or the roundsman on the beat.\"\r\n\r\nThe door at the top of the steps was also Yale-locked. We stepped at\r\nonce into the kitchen, from which I imagined that the house faced on\r\nanother street, and that for obvious reasons only its rear entrance was\r\nused. The kitchen was bright and clean; it was littered, however, with\r\nhalf-cut loaves of bread, glasses and empty bottles. Over the range a\r\nman in his shirt sleeves was giving his whole attention to a slice of\r\nham, sizzling on a skillet, and at a table near-by a young fellow, with\r\nhis hair cut in a barber's oval over the back of his neck, was\r\nspreading slices of bread and cheese with mustard.\r\n\r\n\"How are you, Mr. Mayor?\" Hunter said, as he shed his raincoat. \"This is\r\nMr. Knox, the man who's engineering the _Star-Eagle_ fight.\"\r\n\r\nThe man over the range wiped one greasy hand and held it out to me.\r\n\r\n\"The Cat is purring a welcome,\" he said, indicating the frying ham. \"If\r\nmy cooking turns out right I'll ask you to have some ham with me. I\r\ndon't know why in thunder it gets black in the middle and won't cook\r\naround the edges.\"\r\n\r\nI recognized the mayor. He was a big fellow, handsome in a heavy way,\r\nand \"Tommy\" to every one who knew him. It seemed I was about to see my\r\ncity government at play.\r\n\r\nHunter was thoroughly at home. He took my coat and his own and hung them\r\nsomewhere to dry. Then he went into a sort of pantry opening off the\r\nkitchen and came out with four bottles of beer.\r\n\r\n\"We take care of ourselves here,\" he explained, as the newly barbered\r\nyouth washed some glasses. \"If you want a sandwich, there is cooked ham\r\nin the refrigerator and cheese--if our friend at the sink has left\r\nany.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy looked up from his glasses. \"It's rat-trap cheese, that stuff,\"\r\nhe growled.\r\n\r\n\"The other ran out an hour ago and didn't come back,\" put in the mayor,\r\ngrinning. \"You can kill that with mustard, if it's too lively.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get some cigars, will you?\" Hunter asked me. \"They're on a shelf in the\r\npantry. I have my hands full.\"\r\n\r\nI went for the cigars, remembering to keep my eyes open. The pantry was\r\na small room: it contained an ice-box, stocked with drinkables, ham,\r\neggs and butter. On shelves above were cards, cigars and liquors, and\r\nthere, too, I saw a box with an indorsement which showed the \"honor\r\nsystem\" of the Cat Club.\r\n\r\n\"Sign checks and drop here,\" it read, and I thought about the old adage\r\nof honor among thieves and politicians.\r\n\r\nWhen I came out with the cigars Hunter was standing with a group of new\r\narrivals; they included one of the city physicians, the director of\r\npublic charities and a judge of a local court. The latter, McFeely, a\r\nlittle, thin Irishman, knew me and accosted me at once. The mayor was\r\nbusy over the range, and was almost purple with heat and unwonted\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nWhen the three new-comers went up-stairs, instead of going into the\r\ngrill-room, I looked at Hunter.\r\n\r\n\"Is this where the political game is played?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if the political game is poker,\" he replied, and led the way into\r\nthe room which adjoined the kitchen.\r\n\r\nNo one paid any attention to us. Bare tables, a wooden floor, and almost\r\nas many cuspidors as chairs, comprised the furniture of the long room.\r\nIn one corner was a battered upright piano, and there were two\r\nfireplaces with old-fashioned mantels. Perhaps a dozen men were sitting\r\naround, talking loudly, with much scraping of chairs on the bare floor.\r\nAt one table they were throwing poker dice, but the rest were drinking\r\nbeer and talking in a desultory way. At the piano a man with a red\r\nmustache was mimicking the sextette from _Lucia_ and a roar of applause\r\nmet us as we entered the room. Hunter led the way to a corner and put\r\ndown his bottles.\r\n\r\n\"It's fairly quiet to-night,\" he said. \"To-morrow's the big\r\nnight--Saturday.\"\r\n\r\n\"What time do they close up?\" I asked. In answer Hunter pointed to a\r\nsign over the door. It was a card, neatly printed, and it said, \"The\r\nWhite Cat never sleeps.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are only two rules here,\" he explained. \"That is one, and the\r\nother is, 'If you get too noisy, and the patrol wagon comes, make the\r\ndriver take you home.'\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd was good-humored; it paid little or no attention to us, and\r\nwhen some one at the piano began to thump a waltz, Hunter, under cover\r\nof the noise, leaned over to me.\r\n\r\n\"We traced Fleming here, through your corner-man and the cabby,\" he said\r\ncarefully. \"I haven't seen him, but it is a moral certainty he is\r\nskulking in one of the up-stairs rooms. His precious private secretary\r\nis here, too.\"\r\n\r\nI glanced around the room, but no one was paying any attention to us.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know Fleming by sight,\" the detective went on, \"and the\r\npictures we have of him were taken a good while ago, when he wore a\r\nmustache. When he was in local politics, before he went to the\r\nlegislature, he practically owned this place, paying for favors with\r\nmembership tickets. A man could hide here for a year safely. The police\r\nnever come here, and a man's business is his own.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is up-stairs now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. There are four rooms up there for cards, and a bath-room. It's an\r\nold dwelling house. Would Fleming know you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but of course Wardrop would.\"\r\n\r\nAs if in answer to my objection, Wardrop appeared at that moment. He ran\r\ndown the painted wooden stairs and hurried through the room without\r\nlooking to right or left. The piano kept on, and the men at the tables\r\nwere still engrossed with their glasses and one another. Wardrop was\r\nvery pale; he bolted into a man at the door, and pushed him aside\r\nwithout ceremony.\r\n\r\n\"You might go up now,\" Hunter said, rising. \"I will see where the young\r\ngentleman is making for. Just open the door of the different rooms\r\nup-stairs, look around for Fleming, and if any one notices you, ask if\r\nAl Hunter is there. That will let you out.\"\r\n\r\nHe left me then, and after waiting perhaps a minute, I went up-stairs\r\nalone. The second floor was the ordinary upper story of a small dwelling\r\nhouse. The doors were closed, but loud talking, smoke, and the rattle of\r\nchips floated out through open transoms. From below the noise of the\r\npiano came up the staircase, unmelodious but rhythmical, and from the\r\nstreet on which the house faced an automobile was starting its engine,\r\nwith a series of shot-like explosions.\r\n\r\nThe noise was confusing, disconcerting. I opened two doors, to find only\r\nthe usual poker table, with the winners sitting quietly, their cards\r\nbunched in the palms of their hands, and the losers, growing more\r\nvoluble as the night went on, buying chips recklessly, drinking more\r\nthan they should. The atmosphere was reeking with smoke.\r\n\r\nThe third door I opened was that of a dingy bath-room, with a zinc tub\r\nand a slovenly wash-stand. The next, however, was different. The light\r\nstreamed out through the transom as in the other rooms, but there was no\r\nnoise from within. With my hand on the door, I hesitated--then, with\r\nHunter's injunction ringing in my ears, I opened it and looked in.\r\n\r\nA breath of cool night air from an open window met me. There was no\r\nnoise, no smoke, no sour odor of stale beer. A table had been drawn to\r\nthe center of the small room, and was littered with papers, pen and ink.\r\nAt one corner was a tray, containing the remnants of a meal; a pillow\r\nand a pair of blankets on a couch at one side showed the room had been\r\nserving as a bedchamber.\r\n\r\nBut none of these things caught my eye at first. At the table, leaning\r\nforward, his head on his arms, was a man. I coughed, and receiving no\r\nanswer, stepped into the room.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon,\" I said, \"but I am looking, for--\"\r\n\r\nThen the truth burst on me, overwhelmed me. A thin stream was spreading\r\nover the papers on the table, moving slowly, sluggishly, as is the way\r\nwith blood when the heart pump is stopped. I hurried over and raised the\r\nheavy, wobbling, gray head. It was Allan Fleming and he had been shot\r\nthrough the forehead.\r\n\nMy first impulse was to rouse the house; my second, to wait for Hunter.\r\nTo turn loose that mob of half-drunken men in such a place seemed\r\nprofanation. There was nothing of the majesty or panoply of death here,\r\nbut the very sordidness of the surroundings made me resolve to guard the\r\nnew dignity of that figure. I was shocked, of course; it would be absurd\r\nto say that I was emotionally unstrung. On the contrary, I was conscious\r\nof a distinct feeling of disappointment. Fleming had been our key to the\r\nBellwood affair, and he had put himself beyond helping to solve any\r\nmystery. I locked the door and stood wondering what to do next. I should\r\nhave called a doctor, no doubt, but I had seen enough of death to know\r\nthat the man was beyond aid of any kind.\r\n\r\nIt was not until I had bolted the door that I discovered the absence of\r\nany weapon. Everything that had gone before had pointed to a position\r\nso untenable that suicide seemed its natural and inevitable result. With\r\nthe discovery that there was no revolver on the table or floor, the\r\nthing was more ominous. I decided at once to call the young city\r\nphysician in the room across the hall, and with something approximating\r\npanic, I threw open the door--to face Harry Wardrop, and behind him,\r\nHunter.\r\n\r\nI do not remember that any one spoke. Hunter jumped past me into the\r\nroom and took in in a single glance what I had labored to acquire in\r\nthree minutes. As Wardrop came in, Hunter locked the door behind him,\r\nand we three stood staring at the prostrate figure over the table.\r\n\r\nI watched Wardrop: I have never seen so suddenly abject a picture. He\r\ndropped into a chair, and feeling for his handkerchief, wiped his\r\nshaking lips; every particle of color left his face, and he was limp,\r\nunnerved.\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear the shot?\" Hunter asked me. \"It has been a matter of\r\nminutes since it happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" I said, bewildered. \"I heard a lot of explosions, but I\r\nthought it was an automobile, out in the street.\"\r\n\r\nHunter was listening while he examined the room, peering under the\r\ntable, lifting the blankets that had trailed off the couch on to the\r\nfloor. Some one outside tried the door-knob, and finding the door\r\nlocked, shook it slightly.\r\n\r\n\"Fleming!\" he called under his breath. \"Fleming!\"\r\n\r\nWe were silent, in response to a signal from Hunter, and the steps\r\nretreated heavily down the hall. The detective spread the blankets\r\ndecently over the couch, and the three of us moved the body there.\r\nWardrop was almost collapsing.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" Hunter said quietly, \"before I call in Doctor Gray from the room\r\nacross, what do you know about this thing, Mr. Wardrop?\"\r\n\r\nWardrop looked dazed.\r\n\r\n\"He was in a bad way when I left this morning,\" he said huskily. \"There\r\nisn't much use now trying to hide anything; God knows I've done all I\r\ncould. But he has been using cocaine for years, and to-day he ran out of\r\nthe stuff. When I got here, about half an hour ago, he was on the verge\r\nof killing himself. I got the revolver from him--he was like a crazy\r\nman, and as soon as I dared to leave him, I went out to try and find a\r\ndoctor--\"\r\n\r\n\"To get some cocaine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not--because he was already wounded, and you were afraid it was fatal?\"\r\n\r\nWardrop shuddered; then he pulled himself together, and his tone was\r\nmore natural.\r\n\r\n\"What's the use of lying about it?\" he said wearily. \"You won't believe\r\nme if I tell the truth, either, but--he was dead when I got here. I\r\nheard something like the bang of a door as I went up-stairs, but the\r\nnoise was terrific down below, and I couldn't tell. When I went in, he\r\nwas just dropping forward, and--\" he hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"The revolver?\" Hunter queried, lynx-eyed.\r\n\r\n\"Was in his hand. He was dead then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is the revolver?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will turn it over to the coroner.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will give it to me,\" Hunter replied sharply. And after a little\r\nfumbling, Wardrop produced it from his hip pocket. It was an ordinary\r\nthirty-eight. The detective opened it and glanced at it. Two chambers\r\nwere empty.\r\n\r\n\"And you waited--say ten minutes, before you called for help, and even\r\nthen you went outside hunting a doctor! What were you doing in those ten\r\nminutes?\"\r\n\r\nWardrop shut his lips and refused to reply.\r\n\r\n\"If Mr. Fleming shot himself,\" the detective pursued relentlessly,\r\n\"there would be powder marks around the wound. Then, too, he was in the\r\nact of writing a letter. It was a strange impulse, this--you see, he had\r\nonly written a dozen words.\"\r\n\r\nI glanced at the paper on the table. The letter had no superscription;\r\nit began abruptly:\r\n\r\n     \"I shall have to leave here. The numbers have followed me.\r\n     To-night--\"\r\n\r\nThat was all.\r\n\r\n\"This is not suicide,\" Hunter said gravely. \"It is murder, and I warn\r\nyou, Mr. Wardrop, to be careful what you say. Will you ask Doctor Gray\r\nto come in, Mr. Knox?\"\r\n\r\nI went across the hall to the room where the noise was loudest.\r\nFortunately, Doctor Gray was out of the game. He was opening a can of\r\ncaviar at a table in the corner and came out in response to a gesture.\r\nHe did not ask any questions, and I let him go into the death chamber\r\nunprepared. The presence of death apparently had no effect on him, but\r\nthe identity of the dead man almost stupefied him.\r\n\r\n\"Fleming!\" he said, awed, as he looked down at the body. \"Fleming, by\r\nall that's sacred! And a suicide!\"\r\n\r\nHunter watched him grimly.\r\n\r\n\"How long has he been dead?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe doctor glanced at the bullet wound in the forehead, and from there\r\nsignificantly to the group around the couch.\r\n\r\n\"Not an hour--probably less than half,\" he said. \"It's strange we heard\r\nnothing, across the hall there.\"\r\n\r\nHunter took a clean folded handkerchief from his pocket and opening it\r\nlaid it gently over the dead face. I think it was a relief to all of us.\r\nThe doctor got up from his kneeling posture beside the couch, and\r\nlooked at Hunter inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"What about getting him away from here?\" he said. \"There is sure to be a\r\nlot of noise about it, and--you remember what happened when Butler\r\nkilled himself here.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was reported as being found dead in the lumber yard,\" Hunter said\r\ndryly. \"Well, Doctor, this body stays where it is, and I don't give a\r\nwhoop if the whole city government wants it moved. It won't be. This is\r\nmurder, not suicide.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor's expression was curious.\r\n\r\n\"Murder!\" he repeated. \"Why--who--\"\r\n\r\nBut Hunter had many things to attend to; he broke in ruthlessly on the\r\ndoctor's amazement.\r\n\r\n\"See if you can get the house empty, Doctor; just tell them he is\r\ndead--the story will get out soon enough.\"\r\n\r\nAs the doctor left the room Hunter went to the open window, through\r\nwhich a fresh burst of rain was coming, and closed it. The window gave\r\nme an idea, and I went over and tried to see through the streaming pane.\r\nThere was no shed or low building outside, but not five yards away the\r\nwarehouse showed its ugly walls and broken windows.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Hunter,\" I said, \"why could he not have been shot from the\r\nwarehouse?\"\r\n\r\n\"He could have been--but he wasn't,\" Hunter affirmed, glancing at\r\nWardrop's drooping figure. \"Mr. Wardrop, I am going to send for the\r\ncoroner, and then I shall ask you to go with me to the office and tell\r\nthe chief what you know about this. Knox, will you telephone to the\r\ncoroner?\"\r\n\r\nIn an incredibly short time the club-house was emptied, and before\r\nmidnight the coroner himself arrived and went up to the room. As for me,\r\nI had breakfasted, lunched and dined on horrors, and I sat in the\r\ndeserted room down-stairs and tried to think how I was to take the news\r\nto Margery.\r\n\r\nAt twelve-thirty Wardrop, Hunter and the coroner came down-stairs,\r\nleaving a detective in charge of the body until morning, when it could\r\nbe taken home. The coroner had a cab waiting, and he took us at once to\r\nHunter's chief. He had not gone to bed, and we filed into his library\r\nsepulchrally.\r\n\r\nWardrop told his story, but it was hardly convincing. The chief, a large\r\nman who said very little, and leaned back with his eyes partly shut,\r\nlistened in silence, only occasionally asking a question. The coroner,\r\nwho was yawning steadily, left in the middle of Wardrop's story, as if\r\nin his mind, at least, the guilty man was as good as hanged.\r\n\r\n\"I am--I was--Mr. Allan Fleming's private secretary,\" Wardrop began. \"I\r\nsecured the position through a relationship on his wife's side. I have\r\nheld the position for three years. Before that I read law. For some time\r\nI have known that Mr. Fleming used a drug of some kind. Until a week ago\r\nI did not know what it was. On the ninth of May, Mr. Fleming sent for\r\nme. I was in Plattsburg at the time, and he was at home. He was in a\r\nterrible condition--not sleeping at all, and he said he was being\r\nfollowed by some person who meant to kill him. Finally he asked me to\r\nget him some cocaine, and when he had taken it he was more like himself.\r\nI thought the pursuit was only in his own head. He had a man named\r\nCarter on guard in his house, and acting as butler.\r\n\r\n\"There was trouble of some sort in the organization; I do not know just\r\nwhat. Mr. Schwartz came here to meet Mr. Fleming, and it seemed there\r\nwas money needed. Mr. Fleming had to have it at once. He gave me some\r\nsecurities to take to Plattsburg and turn into money. I went on the\r\ntenth--\"\r\n\r\n\"Was that the day Mr. Fleming disappeared?\" the chief interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He went to the White Cat, and stayed there. No one but the\r\ncaretaker and one other man knew he was there. On the night of the\r\ntwenty-first, I came back, having turned my securities into money. I\r\ncarried it in a package in a small Russia leather bag that never left my\r\nhand for a moment. Mr. Knox here suggested that I had put it down, and\r\nit had been exchanged for one just like it, but I did not let it out of\r\nmy hand on that journey until I put it down on the porch at the Bellwood\r\nhouse, while I tried to get in. I live at Bellwood, with the Misses\r\nMaitland, sisters of Mr. Fleming's deceased wife. I don't pretend to\r\nknow how it happened, but while I was trying to get into the house it\r\nwas rifled. Mr. Knox will bear me out in that. I found my grip empty.\"\r\n\r\nI affirmed it in a word. The chief was growing interested.\r\n\r\n\"What was in the bag?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nWardrop tried to remember.\r\n\r\n\"A pair of pajamas,\" he said, \"two military brushes and a clothes-brush,\r\ntwo or three soft-bosomed shirts, perhaps a half-dozen collars, and a\r\nsuit of underwear.\"\r\n\r\n\"And all this was taken, as well as the money?\"\r\n\r\n\"The bag was left empty, except for my railroad schedule.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief and Hunter exchanged significant glances. Then--\r\n\r\n\"Go on, if you please,\" the detective said cheerfully.\r\n\r\nI think Wardrop realized the absurdity of trying to make any one believe\r\nthat part of the story. He shut his lips and threw up his head as if he\r\nintended to say nothing further.\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" I urged. If he could clear himself he must. I could not go back\r\nto Margery Fleming and tell her that her father had been murdered and\r\nher lover was accused of the crime.\r\n\r\n\"The bag was empty,\" he repeated. \"I had not been five minutes trying to\r\nopen the shutters, and yet the bag had been rifled. Mr. Knox here found\r\nit among the flowers below the veranda, empty.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief eyed me with awakened interest.\r\n\r\n\"You also live at Bellwood, Mr. Knox?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I am attorney to Miss Letitia Maitland, and was there one night as\r\nher guest. I found the bag as Mr. Wardrop described, empty.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief turned back to Wardrop.\r\n\r\n\"How much money was there in it when you--left it?\"\r\n\r\n\"A hundred thousand dollars. I was afraid to tell Mr. Fleming, but I had\r\nto do it. We had a stormy scene, this morning. I think he thought the\r\nnatural thing--that I had taken it.\"\r\n\r\n\"He struck you, I believe, and knocked you down?\" asked Hunter smoothly.\r\n\r\nWardrop flushed.\r\n\r\n\"He was not himself; and, well, it meant a great deal to him. And he was\r\nout of cocaine; I left him raging, and when I went home I learned that\r\nMiss Jane Maitland had disappeared, been abducted, at the time my\r\nsatchel had been emptied! It's no wonder I question my sanity.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then--to-night?\" the chief persisted.\r\n\r\n\"To-night, I felt that some one would have to look after Mr. Fleming; I\r\nwas afraid he would kill himself. It was a bad time to leave while Miss\r\nJane was missing. But--when I got to the White Cat I found him dead. He\r\nwas sitting with his back to the door, and his head on the table.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was the revolver in his hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are sure?\" from Hunter. \"Isn't it a fact, Mr. Wardrop, that you\r\ntook Mr. Fleming's revolver from him this morning when he threatened you\r\nwith it?\"\r\n\r\nWardrop's face twitched nervously.\r\n\r\n\"You have been misinformed,\" he replied, but no one was impressed by his\r\ntone. It was wavering, uncertain. From Hunter's face I judged it had\r\nbeen a random shot, and had landed unexpectedly well.\r\n\r\n\"How many people knew that Mr. Fleming had been hiding at the White\r\nCat?\" from the chief.\r\n\r\n\"Very few--besides myself, only a man who looks after the club-house in\r\nthe mornings, and Clarkson, the cashier of the Borough Bank, who met him\r\nthere once by appointment.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief made no comment.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Knox, what about you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I opened the door into Mr. Fleming's room, perhaps a couple of minutes\r\nafter Mr. Wardrop went out,\" I said. \"He was dead then, leaning on his\r\noutspread arms over the table; he had been shot in the forehead.\"\r\n\r\n\"You heard no shot while you were in the hall?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was considerable noise; I heard two or three sharp reports like\r\nthe explosions of an automobile engine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did they seem close at hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not particularly; I thought, if I thought at all, that they were on the\r\nstreet.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right about the automobile,\" Hunter said dryly. \"The mayor sent\r\nhis car away as I left to follow Mr. Wardrop. The sounds you heard were\r\nnot shots.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a strange thing,\" the chief reflected, \"that a revolver could be\r\nfired in the upper room of an ordinary dwelling house, while that house\r\nwas filled with people--and nobody hear it. Were there any powder marks\r\non the body?\"\r\n\r\n\"None,\" Hunter said.\r\n\r\nThe chief got up stiffly.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you very much, gentlemen,\" he spoke quietly. \"I think that is\r\nall. Hunter, I would like to see you for a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\nI think Wardrop was dazed at finding himself free; he had expected\r\nnothing less than an immediate charge of murder. As we walked to the\r\ncorner for a car or cab, whichever materialized first, he looked back.\r\n\r\n\"I thought so,\" he said bitterly. A man was loitering after us along the\r\nstreet. The police were not asleep, they had only closed one eye.\r\n\r\nThe last train had gone. We took a night electric car to Wynton, and\r\nwalked the three miles to Bellwood. Neither of us was talkative, and I\r\nimagine we were both thinking of Margery, and the news she would have to\r\nhear.\r\n\r\nIt had been raining, and the roads were vile. Once Wardrop turned\r\naround to where we could hear the detective splashing along, well\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n\"I hope he's enjoying it,\" he said. \"I brought you by this road, so he'd\r\nhave to wade in mud up to his neck.\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil you did!\" I exclaimed. \"I'll have to be scraped with a knife\r\nbefore I can get my clothes off.\"\r\n\r\nWe both felt better for the laugh; it was a sort of nervous reaction.\r\nThe detective was well behind, but after a while Wardrop stood still,\r\nwhile I plowed along. They came up together presently, and the three of\r\nus trudged on, talking of immaterial things.\r\n\r\nAt the door Wardrop turned to the detective with a faint smile. \"It's\r\nraining again,\" he said, \"you'd better come in. You needn't worry about\r\nme; I'm not going to run away, and there's a couch in the library.\"\r\n\r\nThe detective grinned, and in the light from the hall I recognized the\r\nman I had followed to the police station two nights before.\r\n\r\n\"I guess I will,\" he said, looking apologetically at his muddy clothes.\r\n\"This thing is only a matter of form, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nBut he didn't lie down on the couch. He took a chair in the hall near\r\nthe foot of the stairs, and we left him there, with the evening paper\r\nand a lamp. It was a queer situation, to say the least.\r\n\nWardrop looked so wretched that I asked him into my room, and mixed him\r\nsome whisky and water. When I had given him a cigar he began to look a\r\nlittle less hopeless.\r\n\r\n\"You've been a darned sight better to me than I would have been to you,\r\nunder the circumstances,\" he said gratefully.\r\n\r\n\"I thought we would better arrange about Miss Margery before we try to\r\nsettle down,\" I replied. \"What she has gone through in the last\r\ntwenty-four hours is nothing to what is coming to-morrow. Will you tell\r\nher about her father?\"\r\n\r\nHe took a turn about the room.\r\n\r\n\"I believe it would come better from you,\" he said finally. \"I am in the\r\npeculiar position of having been suspected by her father of robbing him,\r\nby you of carrying away her aunt, and now by the police and everybody\r\nelse of murdering her father.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not suspect you of anything,\" I justified myself. \"I don't think\r\nyou are entirely open, that is all, Wardrop. I think you are damaging\r\nyourself to shield some one else.\"\r\n\r\nHis expressive face was on its guard in a moment. He ceased his restless\r\npacing, pausing impressively before me.\r\n\r\n\"I give you my word as a gentleman--I do not know who killed Mr.\r\nFleming, and that when I first saw him dead, my only thought was that he\r\nhad killed himself. He had threatened to, that day. Why, if you think I\r\nkilled him, you would have to think I robbed him, too, in order to find\r\na motive.\"\r\n\r\nI did not tell him that that was precisely what Hunter _did_ think. I\r\nevaded the issue.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Wardrop, did you ever hear of the figures eleven twenty-two?\" I\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\"Eleven twenty-two?\" he repeated. \"No, never in any unusual connection.\"\r\n\r\n\"You never heard Mr. Fleming use them?\" I persisted.\r\n\r\nHe looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"Probably,\" he said. \"In the very nature of Mr. Fleming's position, we\r\nused figures all the time. Eleven twenty-two. That's the time the\r\ntheater train leaves the city for Bellwood. Not what you want, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite,\" I answered non-committally and began to wind my watch. He\r\ntook the hint and prepared to leave.\r\n\r\n\"I'll not keep you up any longer,\" he said, picking up his raincoat. He\r\nopened the door and stared ruefully down at the detective in the hall\r\nbelow. \"The old place is queer without Miss Jane,\" he said irrelevantly.\r\n\"Well, good night, and thanks.\"\r\n\r\nHe went heavily along the hall and I closed my door, I heard him pass\r\nMargery's room and then go back and rap lightly. She was evidently\r\nawake.\r\n\r\n\"It's Harry,\" he called. \"I thought you wouldn't worry if you knew I was\r\nin the house to-night.\"\r\n\r\nShe asked him something, for--\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he is here,\" he said. He stood there for a moment, hesitating over\r\nsomething, but whatever it was, he decided against it.\r\n\r\n\"Good night, dear,\" he said gently and went away.\r\n\r\nThe little familiarity made me wince. Every unattached man has the same\r\npang now and then. I have it sometimes when Edith sits on the arm of\r\nFred's chair, or one of the youngsters leaves me to run to \"daddy.\" And\r\none of the sanest men I ever met went to his office and proposed to his\r\nstenographer in sheer craving for domesticity, after watching the wife\r\nof one of his friends run her hand over her husband's chin and give him\r\na reproving slap for not having shaved!\r\n\r\nI pulled myself up sharply and after taking off my dripping coat, I went\r\nto the window and looked out into the May night. It seemed incredible\r\nthat almost the same hour the previous night little Miss Jane had\r\ndisappeared, had been taken bodily away through the peace of the warm\r\nspring darkness, and that I, as wide-awake as I was at that moment,\r\nacute enough of hearing to detect Wardrop's careful steps on the gravel\r\nwalk below, had heard no struggle, had permitted this thing to happen\r\nwithout raising a finger in the old lady's defense. And she was gone as\r\ncompletely as if she had stepped over some psychic barrier into the\r\nfourth dimension!\r\n\r\nI found myself avoiding the more recent occurrence at the White Cat. I\r\nwas still too close to it to have gained any perspective. On that\r\nsubject I was able to think clearly of only one thing: that I would have\r\nto tell Margery in the morning, and that I would have given anything I\r\npossessed for a little of Edith's diplomacy with which to break the bad\r\nnews. It was Edith who broke the news to me that the moths had got into\r\nmy evening clothes while I was hunting in the Rockies, by telling me\r\nthat my dress-coat made me look narrow across the shoulders and\r\npersuading me to buy a new one and give the old one to Fred. Then she\r\nbroke the news of the moths to Fred!\r\n\r\nI was ready for bed when Wardrop came back and rapped at my door. He was\r\nstill dressed, and he had the leather bag in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" he said excitedly, when I had closed the door, \"this is not\r\nmy bag at all. Fool that I was. I never examined it carefully.\"\r\n\r\nHe held it out to me, and I carried it to the light. It was an ordinary\r\neighteen-inch Russia leather traveling-bag, tan in color, and with\r\ngold-plated mountings. It was empty, save for the railroad schedule\r\nthat still rested in one side pocket. Wardrop pointed to the empty\r\npocket on the other side.\r\n\r\n\"In my bag,\" he explained rapidly, \"my name was written inside that\r\npocket, in ink. I did it myself--my name and address.\"\r\n\r\nI looked inside the pockets on both sides: nothing had been written in.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see?\" he asked excitedly. \"Whoever stole my bag had this one\r\nto substitute for it. If we can succeed in tracing the bag here to the\r\nshop it came from, and from there to the purchaser, we have the thief.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no maker's name in it,\" I said, after a casual examination.\r\nWardrop's face fell, and he took the bag from me despondently.\r\n\r\n\"No matter which way I turn,\" he said, \"I run into a blind alley. If I\r\nwere worth a damn, I suppose I could find a way out. But I'm not. Well,\r\nI'll let you sleep this time.\"\r\n\r\nAt the door, however, he turned around and put the bag on the floor,\r\njust inside.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't mind, I'll leave it here,\" he said. \"They'll be searching\r\nmy room, I suppose, and I'd like to have the bag for future reference.\"\r\n\r\nHe went for good that time, and I put out the light. As an afterthought\r\nI opened my door perhaps six inches, and secured it with one of the pink\r\nconch-shells which flanked either end of the stone hearth. I had failed\r\nthe night before: I meant to be on hand that night.\r\n\r\nI went to sleep immediately, I believe. I have no idea how much later it\r\nwas that I roused. I wakened suddenly and sat up in bed. There had been\r\na crash of some kind, for the shock was still vibrating along my nerves.\r\nDawn was close; the window showed gray against the darkness inside, and\r\nI could make out dimly the larger objects in the room. I listened\r\nintently, but the house seemed quiet. Still I was not satisfied. I got\r\nup and, lighting the candle, got into my raincoat in lieu of a\r\ndressing-gown, and prepared to investigate.\r\n\r\nWith the fatality that seemed to pursue my feet in that house, with my\r\nfirst step I trod squarely on top of the conch-shell, and I fell back on\r\nto the edge of the bed swearing softly and holding the injured member.\r\nOnly when the pain began to subside did I realize that I had left the\r\nshell on the door-sill, and that it had moved at least eight feet while\r\nI slept!\r\n\r\nWhen I could walk I put it on the mantel, its mate from the other end of\r\nthe hearth beside it. Then I took my candle and went out into the hall.\r\nMy door, which I had left open, I found closed; nothing else was\r\ndisturbed. The leather bag sat just inside, as Wardrop had left it.\r\nThrough Miss Maitland's transom were coming certain strangled and\r\nirregular sounds, now falsetto, now deep bass, that showed that worthy\r\nlady to be asleep. A glance down the staircase revealed Davidson,\r\nstretching in his chair and looking up at me.\r\n\r\n\"I'm frozen,\" he called up cautiously. \"Throw me down a blanket or two,\r\nwill you?\"\r\n\r\nI got a couple of blankets from my bed and took them down. He was\r\nexamining his chair ruefully.\r\n\r\n\"There isn't any grip to this horsehair stuff,\" he complained. \"Every\r\ntime I doze off I dream I'm coasting down the old hill back on the farm,\r\nand when I wake up I'm sitting on the floor, with the end of my back\r\nbone bent like a hook.\"\r\n\r\nHe wrapped himself in the blankets and sat down again, taking the\r\nprecaution this time to put his legs on another chair and thus anchor\r\nhimself. Then he produced a couple of apples and a penknife and\r\nproceeded to pare and offer me one.\r\n\r\n\"Found 'em in the pantry,\" he said, biting into one. \"I belong to the\r\napple society. Eat one apple every day and keep healthy!\" He stopped and\r\nstared intently at the apple. \"I reckon I got a worm that time,\" he\r\nsaid, with less ardor.\r\n\r\n\"I'll get something to wash him down,\" I offered, rising, but he waved\r\nme back to my stair.\r\n\r\n\"Not on your life,\" he said with dignity. \"Let him walk. How are things\r\ngoing up-stairs?\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't happen to be up there a little while ago, did you?\" I\r\nquestioned in turn.\r\n\r\n\"No. I've been kept busy trying to sit tight where I am. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some one came into my room and wakened me,\" I explained. \"I heard a\r\nracket and when I got up I found a shell that I had put on the door-sill\r\nto keep the door open, in the middle of the room. I stepped on it.\"\r\n\r\nHe examined a piece of apple before putting it in his mouth. Then he\r\nturned a pair of shrewd eyes on me.\r\n\r\n\"That's funny,\" he said. \"Anything in the room disturbed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where's the shell now?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the mantel. I didn't want to step on it again.\"\r\n\r\nHe thought for a minute, but his next remark was wholly facetious.\r\n\r\n\"No. I guess you won't step on it up there. Like the old woman: she\r\nsays, 'Motorman, if I put my foot on the rail will I be electrocuted?'\r\nAnd he says, 'No, madam, not unless you put your other foot on the\r\ntrolley wire.'\"\r\n\r\nI got up impatiently. There was no humor in the situation that night for\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"Some one had been in the room,\" I reiterated. \"The door was closed,\r\nalthough I had left it open.\"\r\n\r\nHe finished his apple and proceeded with great gravity to drop the\r\nparings down the immaculate register in the floor beside his chair.\r\nThen--\r\n\r\n\"I've only got one business here, Mr. Knox,\" he said in an undertone,\r\n\"and you know what that is. But if it will relieve your mind of the\r\nthought that there was anything supernatural about your visitor, I'll\r\ntell you that it was Mr. Wardrop, and that to the best of my belief he\r\nwas in your room, not once, but twice, in the last hour and a half. As\r\nfar as that shell goes, it was I that kicked it, having gone up without\r\nmy shoes.\"\r\n\r\nI stared at him blankly.\r\n\r\n\"What could he have wanted?\" I exclaimed. But with his revelation,\r\nDavidson's interest ceased; he drew the blanket up around his shoulders\r\nand shivered.\r\n\r\n\"Search me,\" he said and yawned.\r\n\r\nI went back to bed, but not to sleep. I deliberately left the door wide\r\nopen, but no intrusion occurred. Once I got up and glanced down the\r\nstairs. For all his apparent drowsiness, Davidson heard my cautious\r\nmovements, and saluted me in a husky whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Have you got any quinine?\" he said. \"I'm sneezing my head off.\"\r\n\r\nBut I had none. I gave him a box of cigarettes, and after partially\r\ndressing, I threw myself across the bed to wait for daylight. I was\r\nroused by the sun beating on my face, to hear Miss Letitia's tones from\r\nher room across.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" she was saying querulously. \"Don't you suppose I can smell?\r\nDo you think because I'm a little hard of hearing that I've lost my\r\nother senses? Somebody's been smoking.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's me,\" Heppie shouted. \"I--\"\r\n\r\n\"You?\" Miss Letitia snarled. \"What are you smoking for? That ain't my\r\nshirt; it's my--\"\r\n\r\n\"I ain't smokin',\" yelled Heppie. \"You won't let me tell you. I spilled\r\nvinegar on the stove; that's what you smell.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Letitia's sardonic chuckle came through the door.\r\n\r\n\"Vinegar,\" she said with scorn. \"Next thing you'll be telling me it's\r\nvinegar that Harry and Mr. Knox carry around in little boxes in their\r\npockets. You've pinned my cap to my scalp.\"\r\n\r\nI hurried down-stairs to find Davidson gone. My blanket lay neatly\r\nfolded, on the lower step, and the horsehair chairs were ranged along\r\nthe wall as before. I looked around anxiously for telltale ashes, but\r\nthere was none, save, at the edge of the spotless register, a trace.\r\nEvidently they had followed the apple parings. It grew cold a day or so\r\nlater, and Miss Letitia had the furnace fired, and although it does not\r\nbelong to my story, she and Heppie searched the house over to account\r\nfor the odor of baking apples--a mystery that was never explained.\r\n\r\nWardrop did not appear at breakfast. Margery came down-stairs as Bella\r\nwas bringing me my coffee, and dropped languidly into her chair. She\r\nlooked tired and white.\r\n\r\n\"Another day!\" she said wearily. \"Did you ever live through such an\r\neternity as the last thirty-six hours?\"\r\n\r\nI responded absently; the duty I had assumed hung heavy over me. I had a\r\nfrantic impulse to shirk the whole thing: to go to Wardrop and tell him\r\nit was his responsibility, not mine, to make this sad-eyed girl sadder\r\nstill. That as I had not his privilege of comforting her, neither should\r\nI shoulder his responsibility of telling her. But the issue was forced\r\non me sooner than I had expected, for at that moment I saw the glaring\r\nhead-lines of the morning paper, laid open at Wardrop's plate.\r\n\r\nShe must have followed my eyes, for we reached for it simultaneously.\r\nShe was nearer than I, and her quick eye caught the name. Then I put my\r\nhand over the heading and she flushed with indignation.\r\n\r\n\"You are not to read it now,\" I said, meeting her astonished gaze as\r\nbest I could. \"Please let me have it. I promise you I will give it to\r\nyou--almost immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very rude,\" she said without relinquishing the paper. \"I saw a\r\npart of that; it is about my father!\"\r\n\r\n\"Drink your coffee, please,\" I pleaded. \"I will let you read it then. On\r\nmy honor.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at me; then she withdrew her hand and sat erect.\r\n\r\n\"How can you be so childish!\" she exclaimed. \"If there is anything in\r\nthat paper that it--will hurt me to learn, is a cup of coffee going to\r\nmake it any easier?\"\r\n\r\nI gave up then. I had always thought that people heard bad news better\r\nwhen they had been fortified with something to eat, and I had a very\r\ndistinct recollection that Fred had made Edith drink something--tea\r\nprobably--before he told her that Billy had fallen off the back fence\r\nand would have to have a stitch taken in his lip. Perhaps I should have\r\noffered Margery tea instead of coffee. But as it was, she sat, stonily\r\nerect, staring at the paper, and feeling that evasion would be useless,\r\nI told her what had happened, breaking the news as gently as I could.\r\n\r\nI stood by her helplessly through the tearless agony that followed, and\r\ncursed myself for a blundering ass. I had said that he had been\r\naccidentally shot, and I said it with the paper behind me, but she put\r\nthe evasion aside bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"Accidentally!\" she repeated. The first storm of grief over, she lifted\r\nher head from where it had rested on her arms and looked at me, scorning\r\nmy subterfuge. \"He was murdered. That's the word I didn't have time to\r\nread! Murdered! And you sat back and let it happen. I went to you in\r\ntime and you didn't do anything. No one did anything!\"\r\n\r\nI did not try to defend myself. How could I? And afterward when she sat\r\nup and pushed back the damp strands of hair from her eyes, she was more\r\nreasonable.\r\n\r\n\"I did not mean what I said about your not having done anything,\" she\r\nsaid, almost childishly. \"No one could have done more. It was to happen,\r\nthat's all.\"\r\n\r\nBut even then I knew she had trouble in store that she did not suspect.\r\nWhat would she do when she heard that Wardrop was under grave suspicion?\r\nBetween her dead father and her lover, what? It was to be days before I\r\nknew and in all that time, I, who would have died, not cheerfully but at\r\nleast stoically, for her, had to stand back and watch the struggle, not\r\ndaring to hold out my hand to help, lest by the very gesture she divine\r\nmy wild longing to hold her for myself.\r\n\r\nShe recovered bravely that morning from the shock, and refusing to go to\r\nher room and lie down--a suggestion, like the coffee, culled from my\r\nvicarious domestic life--she went out to the veranda and sat there in\r\nthe morning sun, gazing across the lawn. I left her there finally, and\r\nbroke the news of her brother-in-law's death to Miss Letitia. After the\r\nfirst surprise, the old lady took the news with what was nearer\r\ncomplacency than resignation.\r\n\r\n\"Shot!\" she said, sitting up in bed, while Heppie shook her pillows.\r\n\"It's a queer death for Allan Fleming; I always said he would be\r\nhanged.\"\r\n\r\nAfter that, she apparently dismissed him from her mind, and we talked of\r\nher sister. Her mood had changed and it was depressing to find that she\r\nspoke of Jane always in the past tense. She could speak of her quite\r\ncalmly--I suppose the sharpness of our emotions is in inverse ratio to\r\nour length of years, and she regretted that, under the circumstances,\r\nJane would not rest in the family lot.\r\n\r\n\"We are all there,\" she said, \"eleven of us, counting my sister Mary's\r\nhusband, although he don't properly belong, and I always said we would\r\ntake him out if we were crowded. It is the best lot in the Hopedale\r\nCemetery; you can see the shaft for two miles in any direction.\"\r\n\r\nWe held a family council that morning around Miss Letitia's bed:\r\nWardrop, who took little part in the proceedings, and who stood at a\r\nwindow looking out most of the time, Margery on the bed, her arm around\r\nMiss Letitia's shriveled neck, and Heppie, who acted as interpreter and\r\nshouted into the old lady's ear such parts of the conversation as she\r\nconsidered essential.\r\n\r\n\"I have talked with Miss Fleming,\" I said, as clearly as I could, \"and\r\nshe seems to shrink from seeing people. The only friends she cares about\r\nare in Europe, and she tells me there are no other relatives.\"\r\n\r\nHeppie condensed this into a vocal capsule, and thrust it into Miss\r\nLetitia's ear. The old lady nodded.\r\n\r\n\"No other relatives,\" she corroborated. \"God be praised for that,\r\nanyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" I went on, \"there are things to look after, certain necessary\r\nduties that no one else can attend to. I don't want to insist, but she\r\nought, if she is able, to go to the city house, for a few hours, at\r\nleast.\"\r\n\r\n\"City house!\" Heppie yelled in her ear.\r\n\r\n\"It ought to be cleaned,\" Miss Letitia acquiesced, \"and fresh curtains\r\nput up. Jane would have been in her element; she was always handy at a\r\nfuneral. And don't let them get one of those let-down-at-the-side\r\ncoffins. They're leaky.\"\r\n\r\nLuckily Margery did not notice this.\r\n\r\n\"I was going to suggest,\" I put in hurriedly, \"that my brother's wife\r\nwould be only too glad to help, and if Miss Fleming will go into town\r\nwith me, I am sure Edith would know just what to do. She isn't curious\r\nand she's very capable.\"\r\n\r\nMargery threw me a grateful glance, grateful, I think, that I could\r\nunderstand how, under the circumstances, a stranger was more acceptable\r\nthan curious friends could be.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Knox's sister-in-law!\" interpreted Heppie.\r\n\r\n\"When you have to say the letter 's,' turn your head away,\" Miss Letitia\r\nrebuked her. \"Well, I don't object, if Knox's sister-in-law don't.\" She\r\nhad an uncanny way of expanding Heppie's tabloid speeches. \"You can take\r\nmy white silk shawl to lay over the body, but be sure to bring it back.\r\nWe may need it for Jane.\"\r\n\r\nIf the old lady's chin quivered a bit, while Margery threw her arms\r\naround her, she was mightily ashamed of it. But Heppie was made of\r\nweaker stuff. She broke into a sudden storm of sobs and left the room,\r\nto stick her head in the door a moment after.\r\n\r\n\"Kidneys or chops?\" she shouted almost belligerently.\r\n\r\n\"Kidneys,\" Miss Letitia replied in kind.\r\n\r\nWardrop went with us to the station at noon, but he left us there, with\r\na brief remark that he would be up that night. After I had put Margery\r\nin a seat, I went back to have a word with him alone. He was standing\r\nbeside the train, trying to light a cigarette, but his hands shook\r\nalmost beyond control, and after the fourth match he gave it up. My\r\nminute for speech was gone. As the train moved out I saw him walking\r\nback along the platform, paying no attention to anything around him.\r\nAlso, I had a fleeting glimpse of a man loafing on a baggage truck, his\r\nhat over his eyes. He was paring an apple with a penknife, and dropping\r\nthe peelings with careful accuracy through a crack in the floor of the\r\nplatform.\r\n\r\nI had arranged over the telephone that Edith should meet the train, and\r\nit was a relief to see that she and Margery took to each other at once.\r\nWe drove to the house immediately, and after a few tears when she saw\r\nthe familiar things around her, Margery rose to the situation bravely.\r\nMiss Letitia had sent Bella to put the house in order, and it was\r\nevident that the idea of clean curtains for the funeral had been drilled\r\ninto her until it had become an obsession. Not until Edith had concealed\r\nthe step-ladder were the hangings safe, and late in the afternoon we\r\nheard a crash from the library, and found Bella twisted on the floor,\r\nthe result of putting a teakwood tabouret on a table and from thence\r\nattacking the lace curtains of the library windows.\r\n\r\nEdith gave her a good scolding and sent her off to soak her sprained\r\nankle. Then she righted the tabouret, sat down on it and began on me.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know that you have not been to the office for two days?\" she\r\nsaid severely. \"And do you know that Hawes had hysterics in our front\r\nhall last night? You had a case in court yesterday, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing very much,\" I said, looking over her head. \"Anyhow, I'm tired.\r\nI don't know when I'm going back. I need a vacation.\"\r\n\r\nShe reached behind her and pulling the cord, sent the window shade to\r\nthe top of the window. At the sight of my face thus revealed, she drew a\r\nlong sigh.\r\n\r\n\"The biggest case you ever had, Jack! The biggest retainer you ever\r\nhad--\"\r\n\r\n\"I've spent that,\" I protested feebly.\r\n\r\n\"A vacation, and you only back from Pinehurst!\"\r\n\r\n\"The girl was in trouble--_is_ in trouble, Edith,\" I burst out. \"Any one\r\nwould have done the same thing. Even Fred would hardly have deserted\r\nthat household. It's stricken, positively stricken.\"\r\n\r\nMy remark about Fred did not draw her from cover.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it's your own affair,\" she said, not looking at me, \"and\r\ngoodness knows I'm disinterested about it, you ruin the boys, both\r\nstomachs and dispositions, and I could use your room _splendidly_ as a\r\nsewing-room--\"\r\n\r\n\"Edith! You abominable little liar!\"\r\n\r\nShe dabbed at her eyes furiously with her handkerchief, and walked with\r\ngreat dignity to the door. Then she came back and put her hand on my\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jack, if we could only have saved you this!\" she said, and a minute\r\nlater, when I did not speak: \"Who is the man, dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"A distant relative, Harry Wardrop,\" I replied, with what I think was\r\nvery nearly my natural tone. \"Don't worry, Edith. It's all right. I've\r\nknown it right along.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!\" Edith returned sagely. \"So do I know I've got to die and be\r\nburied some day. Its being inevitable doesn't make it any more\r\ncheerful.\" She went out, but she came back in a moment and stuck her\r\nhead through the door.\r\n\r\n\"_That's_ the only inevitable thing there is,\" she said, taking up the\r\nconversation--an old habit of hers--where she had left off.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what you are talking about,\" I retorted, turning my back\r\non her. \"And anyhow, I regard your suggestion as immoral.\" But when I\r\nturned again, she had gone.\r\n\r\nThat Saturday afternoon at four o'clock the body of Allan Fleming was\r\nbrought home, and placed in state in the music-room of the house.\r\n\r\nMiss Jane had been missing since Thursday night. I called Hunter by\r\ntelephone, and he had nothing to report.\r\n\nI had a tearful message from Hawes late that afternoon, and a little\r\nafter five I went to the office. I found him offering late editions of\r\nthe evening paper to a couple of clients, who were edging toward the\r\ndoor. His expression when he saw me was pure relief, the clients',\r\nrelief strongly mixed with irritation.\r\n\r\nI put the best face on the matter that I could, saw my visitors, and\r\nleft alone, prepared to explain to Hawes what I could hardly explain to\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n\"I've been unavoidably detained, Hawes,\" I said, \"Miss Jane Maitland has\r\ndisappeared from her home.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I understood you over the telephone.\" He had brought my mail and\r\nstood by impassive.\r\n\r\n\"Also, her brother-in-law is dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"The papers are full of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was no one to do anything, Hawes. I was obliged to stay,\" I\r\napologized. I was ostentatiously examining my letters and Hawes said\r\nnothing. I looked up at him sideways, and he looked down at me. Not a\r\nmuscle of his face quivered, save one eye, which has a peculiar\r\ntwitching of the lid when he is excited. It gave him a sardonic\r\nappearance of winking. He winked at me then.\r\n\r\n\"Don't wait, Hawes,\" I said guiltily, and he took his hat and went out.\r\nEvery line of his back was accusation. The sag of his shoulders told me\r\nI had let my biggest case go by default that day; the forward tilt of\r\nhis head, that I was probably insane; the very grip with which he seized\r\nthe door-knob, his \"good night\" from around the door, that he knew there\r\nwas a woman at the bottom of it all. As he closed the door behind him I\r\nput down my letters and dropped my face in my hands. Hawes was right. No\r\namount of professional zeal could account for the interest I had taken.\r\nPartly through force of circumstances, partly of my own volition, I had\r\nplaced myself in the position of first friend to a family with which I\r\nhad had only professional relations; I had even enlisted Edith, when my\r\nacquaintance with Margery Fleming was only three days old! And at the\r\nthought of the girl, of Wardrop's inefficiency and my own hopelessness,\r\nI groaned aloud.\r\n\r\nI had not heard the door open.\r\n\r\n\"I forgot to tell you that a gentleman was here half a dozen times\r\nto-day to see you. He didn't give any name.\"\r\n\r\nI dropped my hands. From around the door Hawes' nervous eye was winking\r\nwildly.\r\n\r\n\"You're not sick, Mr. Knox?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never felt better.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought I heard--\"\r\n\r\n\"I was singing,\" I lied, looking him straight in the eye.\r\n\r\nHe backed nervously to the door.\r\n\r\n\"I have a little sherry in my office, Mr. Knox--twenty-six years in the\r\nwood. If you--\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, Hawes, there's nothing the matter with me!\" I\r\nexclaimed, and he went. But I heard him stand a perceptible time outside\r\nthe door before he tiptoed away.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after, some one entered the waiting-room, and the\r\nnext moment I was facing, in the doorway, a man I had never seen before.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall man, with thin, colorless beard trimmed to a Vandyke\r\npoint, and pale eyes blinking behind glasses. He had a soft hat crushed\r\nin his hand, and his whole manner was one of subdued excitement.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Knox?\" he asked, from the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Come in.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been here six times since noon,\" he said, dropping rather than\r\nsitting in a chair. \"My name is Lightfoot. I am--was--Mr. Fleming's\r\ncashier.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was terribly shocked at the news of his death,\" he stumbled on,\r\ngetting no help from me. \"I was in town and if I had known in time I\r\ncould have kept some of the details out of the papers. Poor Fleming--to\r\nthink he would end it that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"End it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shoot himself.\" He watched me closely.\r\n\r\n\"But he didn't,\" I protested. \"It was not suicide, Mr. Lightfoot.\r\nAccording to the police, it was murder.\"\r\n\r\nHis cold eyes narrowed like a cat's. \"Murder is an ugly word, Mr. Knox.\r\nDon't let us be sensational. Mr. Fleming had threatened to kill himself\r\nmore than once; ask young Wardrop. He was sick and despondent; he left\r\nhis home without a word, which points strongly to emotional insanity. He\r\ncould have gone to any one of a half dozen large clubs here, or at the\r\ncapital. Instead, he goes to a little third-rate political club, where,\r\npresumably, he does his own cooking and hides in a dingy room. Is that\r\nsane? Murder! It was suicide, and that puppy Wardrop knows it well\r\nenough. I--I wish I had him by the throat!\"\r\n\r\nHe had worked himself into quite a respectable rage, but now he calmed\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen the police,\" he went on. \"They agree with me that it was\r\nsuicide, and the party newspapers will straighten it out to-morrow. It\r\nis only unfortunate that the murder theory was given so much publicity.\r\nThe _Times-Post_, which is Democratic, of course, I can not handle.\"\r\n\r\nI sat stupefied.\r\n\r\n\"Suicide!\" I said finally. \"With no weapon, no powder marks, and with a\r\nhalf-finished letter at his elbow.\"\r\n\r\nHe brushed my interruption aside.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fleming had been--careless,\" he said. \"I can tell you in\r\nconfidence, that some of the state funds had been deposited in the\r\nBorough Bank of Manchester, and--the Borough Bank closed its doors at\r\nten o'clock to-day.\"\r\n\r\nI was hardly surprised at that, but the whole trend of events was\r\namazing.\r\n\r\n\"I arrived here last night,\" he said, \"and I searched the city for Mr.\r\nFleming. This morning I heard the news. I have just come from the house:\r\nhis daughter referred me to you. After all, what I want is a small\r\nmatter. Some papers--state documents--are missing, and no doubt are\r\namong Mr. Fleming's private effects. I would like to go through his\r\npapers, and leave to-night for the capital.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have hardly the authority,\" I replied doubtfully. \"Miss Fleming, I\r\nsuppose, would have no objection. His private secretary, Wardrop, would\r\nbe the one to superintend such a search.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you find Wardrop--at once?\"\r\n\r\nSomething in his eagerness put me on my guard.\r\n\r\n\"I will make an attempt,\" I said. \"Let me have the name of your hotel,\r\nand I will telephone you if it can be arranged for to-night.\"\r\n\r\nHe had to be satisfied with that, but his eagerness seemed to me to be\r\nalmost desperation. Oddly enough, I could not locate Wardrop after all.\r\nI got the Maitland house by telephone, to learn that he had left there\r\nabout three o'clock, and had not come back.\r\n\r\nI went to the Fleming house for dinner. Edith was still there, and we\r\nboth tried to cheer Margery, a sad little figure in her black clothes.\r\nAfter the meal, I called Lightfoot at his hotel, and told him that I\r\ncould not find Wardrop; that there were no papers at the house, and that\r\nthe office safe would have to wait until Wardrop was found to open it.\r\nHe was disappointed and furious; like a good many men who are physical\r\ncowards, he said a great deal over the telephone that he would not have\r\ndared to say to my face, and I cut him off by hanging up the receiver.\r\nFrom that minute, in the struggle that was coming, like Fred, I was\r\n\"forninst\" the government.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that Edith should take Margery home with her for the\r\nnight. I thought it a good idea; the very sight of Edith tucking in her\r\nbabies and sitting down beside the library lamp to embroider me a\r\nscarfpin-holder for Christmas would bring Margery back to normal again.\r\nExcept in the matter of Christmas gifts, Edith is the sanest woman I\r\nknow; I recognized it at the dinner table, where she had the little girl\r\nacross from her planning her mourning hats before the dinner was half\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nWhen we rose at last, Margery looked toward the music-room, where the\r\ndead man lay in state. But Edith took her by the arm and pushed her\r\ntoward the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"Get your hat on right away, while Jack calls a cab,\" she directed. \"I\r\nmust get home, or Fred will keep the boys up until nine o'clock. He is\r\nabsolutely without principle.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Margery came down there was a little red spot burning in each pale\r\ncheek, and she ran down the stairs like a scared child. At the bottom\r\nshe clutched the newel-post and looked behind fearfully.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Edith demanded, glancing uneasily over her\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Some one has been up-stairs,\" Margery panted. \"Somebody has been\r\nstaying in the house while we were away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" I said, seeing that her fright was infecting Edith. \"What\r\nmakes you think that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come and look,\" she said, gaining courage, I suppose, from a masculine\r\npresence. And so we went up the long stairs, the two girls clutching\r\nhands, and I leading the way and inclined to scoff.\r\n\r\nAt the door of a small room next to what had been Allan Fleming's\r\nbedroom, we paused and I turned on the light.\r\n\r\n\"Before we left,\" Margery said more quietly, \"I closed this room myself.\r\nIt had just been done over, and the pale blue soils so easily. I came in\r\nthe last thing, and saw covers put over everything. Now look at it!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a sort of boudoir, filled with feminine knickknacks and mahogany\r\nlounging chairs. Wherever possible, a pale brocade had been used, on the\r\nempire couch, in panels in the wall, covering cushions on the\r\nwindow-seat. It was evidently Margery's private sitting-room.\r\n\r\nThe linen cover that had been thrown over the divan was folded back, and\r\na pillow from the window-seat bore the imprint of a head. The table was\r\nstill covered, knobby protuberances indicating the pictures and books\r\nbeneath. On one corner of the table, where the cover had been pushed\r\naside, was a cup, empty and clean-washed, and as if to prove her\r\ncontention, Margery picked up from the floor a newspaper, dated Friday\r\nmorning, the twenty-second.\r\n\r\nA used towel in the bath-room near-by completed the inventory; Margery\r\nhad been right; some one had used the room while the house was closed.\r\n\r\n\"Might it not have been your--father?\" Edith asked, when we stood again\r\nat the foot of the stairs. \"He could have come here to look for\r\nsomething, and lain down to rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so,\" Margery said wanly. \"I left the door so he could get\r\nin with his key, but--he always used his study couch. I don't think he\r\never spent five minutes in my sitting-room in his life.\"\r\n\r\nWe had to let it go at that finally. I put them in a cab, and saw them\r\nstart away: then I went back into the house. I had arranged to sleep\r\nthere and generally to look after things--as I said before. Whatever\r\nscruples I had had about taking charge of Margery Fleming and her\r\naffairs, had faded with Wardrop's defection and the new mystery of the\r\nblue boudoir.\r\n\r\nThe lower floor of the house was full of people that night, local and\r\nstate politicians, newspaper men and the usual crowd of the morbidly\r\ncurious. The undertaker took everything in hand, and late that evening I\r\ncould hear them carrying in tropical plants and stands for the flowers\r\nthat were already arriving. Whatever panoply the death scene had lacked,\r\nAllan Fleming was lying in state now.\r\n\r\nAt midnight things grew quiet. I sat in the library, reading, until\r\nthen, when an undertaker's assistant in a pink shirt and polka-dot\r\ncravat came to tell me that everything was done.\r\n\r\n\"Is it customary for somebody to stay up, on occasions like this?\" I\r\nasked. \"Isn't there an impression that wandering cats may get into the\r\nroom, or something of that sort?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think it will be necessary, sir,\" he said, trying to conceal a\r\nsmile. \"It's all a matter of taste. Some people like to take their\r\ntroubles hard. Since they don't put money on their eyes any more, nobody\r\nwants to rob the dead.\"\r\n\r\nHe left with that cheerful remark, and I closed and locked the house\r\nafter him. I found Bella in the basement kitchen with all the lights\r\nburning full, and I stood at the foot of the stairs while she scooted to\r\nbed like a scared rabbit. She was a strange creature, Bella--not so\r\nstupid as she looked, but sullen, morose--\"smouldering\" about expresses\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI closed the doors into the dining-room and, leaving one light in the\r\nhall, went up to bed. A guest room in the third story had been assigned\r\nme, and I was tired enough to have slept on the floor. The telephone\r\nbell rang just after I got into bed, and grumbling at my luck, I went\r\ndown to the lower floor.\r\n\r\nIt was the _Times-Post_, and the man at the telephone was in a hurry.\r\n\r\n\"This is the _Times-Post_. Is Mr. Wardrop there?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is this?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is John Knox.\"\r\n\r\n\"The attorney?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Knox, are you willing to put yourself on record that Mr. Fleming\r\ncommitted suicide?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not going to put myself on record at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-night's _Star_ says you call it suicide, and that you found him with\r\nthe revolver in his hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Star_ lies!\" I retorted, and the man at the other end chuckled.\r\n\r\n\"Many thanks,\" he said, and rang off.\r\n\r\nI went back to bed, irritated that I had betrayed myself. Loss of sleep\r\nfor two nights, however, had told on me: in a short time I was sound\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nI wakened with difficulty. My head felt stupid and heavy, and I was\r\nburning with thirst. I sat up and wondered vaguely if I were going to be\r\nill, and I remember that I felt too weary to get a drink. As I roused,\r\nhowever, I found that part of my discomfort came from bad ventilation,\r\nand I opened a window and looked out.\r\n\r\nThe window was a side one, opening on to a space perhaps eight feet\r\nwide, which separated it from its neighbor. Across from me was only a\r\nblank red wall, but the night air greeted me refreshingly. The wind was\r\nblowing hard, and a shutter was banging somewhere below. I leaned out\r\nand looked down into the well-like space beneath me. It was one of those\r\napparently chance movements that have vital consequences, and that have\r\nalways made me believe in the old Calvinistic creed of foreordination.\r\n\r\nBelow me, on the wall across, was a rectangle of yellow light, reflected\r\nfrom the library window of the Fleming home. There was some one in the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nAs I still stared, the light was slowly blotted out--not as if the light\r\nhad been switched off, but by a gradual decreasing in size of the\r\nlighted area. The library shade had been drawn.\r\n\r\nMy first thought was burglars; my second--Lightfoot. No matter who it\r\nwas, there was no one who had business there. Luckily, I had brought my\r\nrevolver with me from Fred's that day, and it was under my pillow; to\r\nget it, put out the light and open the door quietly, took only a minute.\r\nI was in pajamas, barefoot, as on another almost similar occasion, but I\r\nwas better armed than before.\r\n\r\nI got to the second floor without hearing or seeing anything suspicious,\r\nbut from there I could see that the light in the hall had been\r\nextinguished. The unfamiliarity of the house, the knowledge of the\r\nsilent figure in the drawing-room at the foot of the stairs, and of\r\nwhatever might be waiting in the library beyond, made my position\r\nuncomfortable, to say the least.\r\n\r\nI don't believe in the man who is never afraid: he doesn't deserve the\r\ncredit he gets. It's the fellow who is scared to death, whose knees\r\nknock together, and who totters rather than walks into danger, who is\r\nthe real hero. Not that I was as bad as that, but I would have liked to\r\nknow where the electric switch was, and to have seen the trap before I\r\nput my head in.\r\n\r\nThe stairs were solidly built, and did not creak. I felt my way down by\r\nthe baluster, which required my right hand, and threw my revolver to my\r\nleft. I got safely to the bottom, and around the newel-post: there was\r\nstill a light in the library, and the door was not entirely closed.\r\nThen, with my usual bad luck, I ran into a heap of folding chairs that\r\nhad been left by the undertaker, and if the crash paralyzed me, I don't\r\nknow what it did to the intruder in the library.\r\n\r\nThe light was out in an instant, and with concealment at an end, I broke\r\nfor the door and threw it open, standing there with my revolver leveled.\r\nWe--the man in the room, and I--were both in absolute darkness. He had\r\nthe advantage of me. He knew my location, and I could not guess his.\r\n\r\n\"Who is here?\" I demanded.\r\n\r\nOnly silence, except that I seemed to hear rapid breathing.\r\n\r\n\"Speak up, or I'll shoot!\" I said, not without an ugly feeling that he\r\nmight be--even probably was--taking careful aim by my voice. The\r\ndarkness was intolerable: I reached cautiously to the left and found,\r\njust beyond the door frame, the electric switch. As I turned it the\r\nlight flashed up. The room was empty, but a porti\u00e8re in a doorway at my\r\nright was still shaking.\r\n\r\nI leaped for the curtain and dragged it aside, to have a door just close\r\nin my face. When I had jerked it open, I found myself in a short hall,\r\nand there were footsteps to my left, I blundered along in the\r\nsemi-darkness, into a black void which must have been the dining-room,\r\nfor my outstretched hand skirted the table. The footsteps seemed only\r\nbeyond my reach, and at the other side of the room the swinging door\r\ninto the pantry was still swaying when I caught it.\r\n\r\nI made a misstep in the pantry, and brought up against a blank wall. It\r\nseemed to me I heard the sound of feet running up steps, and when I\r\nfound a door at last, I threw it open and dashed in.\r\n\r\nThe next moment the solid earth slipped from under my feet, I threw out\r\nmy hand, and it met a cold wall, smooth as glass. Then I fell--fell an\r\nincalculable distance, and the blackness of the night came over me and\r\nsmothered me.\r\n\nWhen I came to, I was lying in darkness, and the stillness was absolute.\r\nWhen I tried to move, I found I was practically a prisoner: I had fallen\r\ninto an air shaft, or something of the kind. I could not move my arms,\r\nwhere they were pinioned to my sides, and I was half-lying,\r\nhalf-crouching, in a semi-vertical position. I worked one arm loose and\r\nmanaged to make out that my prison was probably the dumb-waiter shaft to\r\nthe basement kitchen.\r\n\r\nI had landed on top of the slide, and I seemed to be tied in a knot. The\r\nrevolver was under me, and if it had exploded during the fall it had\r\ndone no damage. I can hardly imagine a more unpleasant position. If the\r\nman I had been following had so chosen, he could have made away with me\r\nin any one of a dozen unpleasant ways--he could have filled me as full\r\nof holes as a sieve, or scalded me, or done anything, pretty much, that\r\nhe chose. But nothing happened. The house was impressively quiet.\r\n\r\nI had fallen feet first, evidently, and then crumpled up unconscious,\r\nfor one of my ankles was throbbing. It was some time before I could\r\nstand erect, and even by reaching, I could not touch the doorway above\r\nme. It must have taken five minutes for my confused senses to remember\r\nthe wire cable, and to tug at it. I was a heavy load for the slide,\r\naccustomed to nothing weightier than political dinners, but with much\r\ncreaking I got myself at last to the floor above, and stepped out, still\r\ninto darkness, but free.\r\n\r\nI still held the revolver, and I lighted the whole lower floor. But I\r\nfound nothing in the dining-room or the pantry. Everything was locked\r\nand in good order. A small alcove off the library came next; it was\r\nundisturbed, but a tabouret lay on its side, and a half dozen books had\r\nbeen taken from a low book-case, and lay heaped on a chair. In the\r\nlibrary, however, everything was confusion. Desk drawers stood open--one\r\nof the linen shades had been pulled partly off its roller, a chair had\r\nbeen drawn up to the long mahogany table in the center of the room, with\r\nthe electric dome overhead, and everywhere, on chairs, over the floor,\r\nheaped in stacks on the table, were papers.\r\n\r\nAfter searching the lower floor, and finding everything securely locked,\r\nI went up-stairs, convinced the intruder was still in the house. I made\r\na systematic search of every room, looking into closets and under beds.\r\nSeveral times I had an impression, as I turned a corner, that some one\r\nwas just ahead of me, but I was always disappointed. I gave up at last,\r\nand, going down to the library, made myself as comfortable as I could,\r\nand waited for morning.\r\n\r\nI heard Bella coming down the stairs, after seven sometime; she came\r\nslowly, with flagging footsteps, as if the slightest sound would send\r\nher scurrying to the upper regions again. A little later I heard her\r\nrattling the range in the basement kitchen, and I went up-stairs and\r\ndressed.\r\n\r\nI was too tired to have a theory about the night visitor; in fact, from\r\nthat time on, I tried to have no theories of any kind. I was impressed\r\nwith only one thing--that the enemy or enemies of the late Allan\r\nFleming evidently carried their antagonism beyond the grave. As I put on\r\nmy collar I wondered how long I could stay in this game, as I now meant\r\nto, and avoid lying in state in Edith's little drawing-room, with\r\nflowers around and a gentleman in black gloves at the door.\r\n\r\nI had my ankle strapped with adhesive that morning by my doctor and it\r\ngave me no more trouble. But I caught him looking curiously at the blue\r\nbruise on my forehead where Wardrop had struck me with the chair, and at\r\nmy nose, no longer swollen, but mustard-yellow at the bridge.\r\n\r\n\"Been doing any boxing lately,\" he said, as I laced up my shoe.\r\n\r\n\"Not for two or three years.\"\r\n\r\n\"New machine?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled at me quizzically from his desk.\r\n\r\n\"How does the other fellow look?\" he inquired, and to my haltingly\r\ninvented explanation of my battered appearance, he returned the same\r\nenigmatical smile.\r\n\r\nThat day was uneventful. Margery and Edith came to the house for about\r\nan hour and went back to Fred's again.\r\n\r\nA cousin of the dead man, an elderly bachelor named Parker, appeared\r\nthat morning and signified his willingness to take charge of the house\r\nduring that day. The very hush of his voice and his black tie prompted\r\nEdith to remove Margery from him as soon as she could, and as the girl\r\ndreaded the curious eyes of the crowd that filled the house, she was\r\nglad to go.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday, and I went to the office only long enough to look over my\r\nmail. I dined in the middle of the day at Fred's, and felt heavy and\r\nstupid all afternoon as a result of thus reversing the habits of the\r\nweek. In the afternoon I had my first conversation with Fred and Edith,\r\nwhile Margery and the boys talked quietly in the nursery. They had taken\r\na great fancy to her, and she was almost cheerful when she was with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFred had the morning papers around him on the floor, and was in his\r\nusual Sunday argumentative mood.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, when the nursery door up-stairs had closed, \"what was\r\nit, Jack? Suicide?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" I replied bluntly.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think?\" he insisted.\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell?\" irritably. \"The police say it was suicide, and they\r\nought to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Times-Post_ says it was murder, and that they will prove it. And\r\nthey claim the police have been called off.\"\r\n\r\nI said nothing of Mr. Lightfoot, and his visit to the office, but I made\r\na mental note to see the _Times-Post_ people and learn, if I could, what\r\nthey knew.\r\n\r\n\"I can not help thinking that he deserved very nearly what he got,\"\r\nEdith broke in, looking much less vindictive than her words. \"When one\r\nthinks of the ruin he brought to poor Henry Butler, and that Ellen has\r\nbeen practically an invalid ever since, I can't be sorry for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was the Butler story?\" I asked. But Fred did not know, and Edith\r\nwas as vague as women usually are in politics.\r\n\r\n\"Henry Butler was treasurer of the state, and Mr. Fleming was his\r\ncashier. I don't know just what the trouble was. But you remember that\r\nHenry Butler killed himself after he got out of the penitentiary, and\r\nEllen has been in one hospital after another. I would like to have her\r\ncome here for a few weeks, Fred,\" she said appealingly. \"She is in some\r\nsanatorium or other now, and we might cheer her a little.\"\r\n\r\nFred groaned.\r\n\r\n\"Have her if you like, petty,\" he said resignedly, \"but I refuse to be\r\ncheerful unless I feel like it. What about this young Wardrop, Jack? It\r\nlooks to me as if the _Times-Post_ reporter had a line on him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush,\" Edith said softly. \"He is Margery's fianc\u00e9, and she might hear\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\" Fred demanded. \"Did she tell you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at her engagement ring,\" Edith threw back triumphantly. \"And it's\r\na perfectly beautiful solitaire, too.\"\r\n\r\nI caught Fred's eye on me, and the very speed with which he shifted his\r\ngaze made me uncomfortable. I made my escape as soon as I could, on the\r\nplea of going out to Bellwood, and in the hall up-stairs I met Margery.\r\n\r\n\"I saw Bella to-day,\" she said. \"Mr. Knox, will you tell me why you\r\nstayed up last night? What happened in the house?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--thought I heard some one in the library,\" I stammered, \"but I found\r\nno one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all the truth or only part of it?\" she asked. \"Why do men\r\nalways evade issues with a woman?\" Luckily, woman-like, she did not wait\r\nfor a reply. She closed the nursery door and stood with her hand on the\r\nknob, looking down.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what you believe about all this,\" she said. \"Do you think my\r\nfather--killed himself? You were there; you know. If some one would only\r\ntell me everything!\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me it was her right to know. The boys were romping noisily\r\nin the nursery. Down-stairs Fred and Edith were having their Sunday\r\nafternoon discussion of what in the world had become of the money from\r\nFred's latest book. Margery and I sat down on the stairs, and, as well\r\nas I could remember the details, I told her what had happened at the\r\nWhite Cat. She heard me through quietly.\r\n\r\n\"And so the police have given up the case!\" she said despairingly. \"And\r\nif they had not, Harry would have been arrested. Is there nothing I can\r\ndo? Do I have to sit back with my hands folded?\"\r\n\r\n\"The police have not exactly given up the case,\" I told her, \"but there\r\nis such a thing, of course, as stirring up a lot of dust and then\r\nrunning to cover like blazes before it settles. By the time the public\r\nhas wiped it out of its eyes and sneezed it out of its nose and coughed\r\nit out of its larynx, the dust has settled in a heavy layer, clues are\r\nobliterated, and the public lifts its skirts and chooses another\r\ndirection. The 'no thoroughfare' sign is up.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat there for fifteen minutes, interrupted by occasional noisy\r\nexcursions from the nursery, which resulted in her acquiring by degrees\r\na lapful of broken wheels, three-legged horses and a live water beetle\r\nwhich the boys had found under the kitchen sink and imprisoned in a\r\nglass topped box, where, to its bewilderment, they were assiduously\r\noffering it dead and mangled flies. But our last five minutes were\r\nundisturbed, and the girl brought out with an effort the request she had\r\ntried to make all day.\r\n\r\n\"Whoever killed my father--and it was murder, Mr. Knox--whoever did it\r\nis going free to save a scandal. All my--friends\"--she smiled\r\nbitterly--\"are afraid of the same thing. But I can not sit quiet and\r\nthink nothing can be done. I _must_ know, and you are the only one who\r\nseems willing to try to find out.\"\r\n\r\nSo it was, that, when I left the house a half hour later, I was\r\ncommitted. I had been commissioned by the girl I loved--for it had come\r\nto that--to clear her lover of her father's murder, and so give him back\r\nto her--not in so many words, but I was to follow up the crime, and the\r\nrest followed. And I was morally certain of two things--first, that her\r\nlover was not worthy of her, and second, and more to the point, that\r\ninnocent or guilty, he was indirectly implicated in the crime.\r\n\r\nI had promised her also to see Miss Letitia that day if I could, and I\r\nturned over the events of the preceding night as I walked toward the\r\nstation, but I made nothing of them. One thing occurred to me, however.\r\nBella had told Margery that I had been up all night. Could Bella--? But\r\nI dismissed the thought as absurd--Bella, who had scuttled to bed in a\r\npanic of fright, would never have dared the lower floor alone, and\r\nBella, given all the courage in the world, could never have moved with\r\nthe swiftness and light certainty of my midnight prowler. It had not\r\nbeen Bella.\r\n\r\nBut after all I did not go to Bellwood. I met Hunter on my way to the\r\nstation, and he turned around and walked with me.\r\n\r\n\"So you've lain down on the case!\" I said, when we had gone a few steps\r\nwithout speaking.\r\n\r\nHe grumbled something unintelligible and probably unrepeatable.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" I persisted, \"being a simple and uncomplicated case of\r\nsuicide, there was nothing in it anyhow. If it had been a murder, under\r\npeculiar circumstances--\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped and gripped my arm.\r\n\r\n\"For ten cents,\" he said gravely, \"I would tell the chief and a few\r\nothers what I think of them. And then I'd go out and get full.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not on ten cents!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going out of the business,\" he stormed. \"I'm going to drive a\r\ngarbage wagon: it's cleaner than this job. Suicide! I never saw a\r\ncleaner case of--\" He stopped suddenly. \"Do you know Burton--of the\r\n_Times-Post_?\"\r\n\r\n\"No: I've heard of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he's your man. They're dead against the ring, and Burton's been\r\ngiven the case. He's as sharp as a steel trap. You two get together.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused at a corner. \"Good-by,\" he said dejectedly. \"I'm off to hunt\r\nsome boys that have been stealing milk bottles. That's about my size,\r\nthese days.\" He turned around, however, before he had gone many steps\r\nand came back.\r\n\r\n\"Wardrop has been missing since yesterday afternoon,\" he said. \"That is,\r\nhe thinks he's missing. We've got him all right.\"\r\n\r\nI gave up my Bellwood visit for the time, and taking a car down-town, I\r\nwent to the _Times-Post_ office. The Monday morning edition was already\r\nunder way, as far as the staff was concerned, and from the waiting-room\r\nI could see three or four men, with their hats on, most of them\r\nrattling typewriters. Burton came in in a moment, a red-haired young\r\nfellow, with a short thick nose and a muggy skin. He was rather stocky\r\nin build, and the pugnacity of his features did not hide the shrewdness\r\nof his eyes.\r\n\r\nI introduced myself, and at my name his perfunctory manner changed.\r\n\r\n\"Knox!\" he said. \"I called you last night over the 'phone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't we talk in a more private place?\" I asked, trying to raise my\r\nvoice above the confusion of the next room. In reply he took me into a\r\ntiny office, containing a desk and two chairs, and separated by an\r\neight-foot partition from the other room.\r\n\r\n\"This is the best we have,\" he explained cheerfully. \"Newspapers are\r\nagents of publicity, not privacy--if you don't care what you say.\"\r\n\r\nI liked Burton. There was something genuine about him; after Wardrop's\r\nkid-glove finish, he was a relief.\r\n\r\n\"Hunter, of the detective bureau, sent me here,\" I proceeded, \"about the\r\nFleming case.\"\r\n\r\nHe took out his note-book. \"You are the fourth to-day,\" he said. \"Hunter\r\nhimself, Lightfoot from Plattsburg, and McFeely here in town. Well, Mr.\r\nKnox, are you willing now to put yourself on record that Fleming\r\ncommitted suicide?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said firmly. \"It is my belief that he was murdered.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that the secretary fellow, what's his name?--Wardrop?--that he\r\nkilled him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply Burton fumbled in his pocket and brought up a pasteboard box,\r\nfilled with jeweler's cotton. Underneath was a small object, which he\r\npassed to me with care.\r\n\r\n\"I got it from the coroner's physician, who performed the autopsy,\" he\r\nsaid casually. \"You will notice that it is a thirty-two, and that the\r\nrevolver they took from Wardrop was a thirty-eight. Question, where's\r\nthe other gun?\"\r\n\r\nI gave him back the bullet, and he rolled it around on the palm of his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"Little thing, isn't it?\" he said. \"We think we're lords of creation,\r\nuntil we see a quarter-inch bichloride tablet, or a bit of lead like\r\nthis. Look here.\" He dived into his pocket again and drew out a roll of\r\nordinary brown paper. When he opened it a bit of white chalk fell on the\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\n\"Look at that,\" he said dramatically. \"Kill an army with it, and they'd\r\nnever know what struck them. Cyanide of potassium--and the druggist that\r\nsold it ought to be choked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did it come from?\" I asked curiously. Burton smiled his cheerful\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"It's a beautiful case, all around,\" he said, as he got his hat. \"I\r\nhaven't had any Sunday dinner yet, and it's five o'clock. Oh--the\r\ncyanide? Clarkson, the cashier of the bank Fleming ruined, took a bite\r\noff that corner right there, this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clarkson!\" I exclaimed. \"How is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"God only knows,\" said Burton gravely, from which I took it Clarkson was\r\ndead.\r\n\nBurton listened while he ate, and his cheerful comments were welcome\r\nenough after the depression of the last few days. I told him, after some\r\nhesitation, the whole thing, beginning with the Maitland pearls and\r\nending with my drop down the dumb-waiter. I knew I was absolutely safe\r\nin doing so: there is no person to whom I would rather tell a secret\r\nthan a newspaper man. He will go out of his way to keep it: he will lock\r\nit in the depths of his bosom, and keep it until seventy times seven.\r\nAlso, you may threaten the rack or offer a larger salary, the seal does\r\nnot come off his lips until the word is given. If then he makes a\r\nscarehead of it, and gets in three columns of space and as many\r\nphotographs, it is his just reward.\r\n\r\nSo--I told Burton everything, and he ate enough beefsteak for two men,\r\nand missed not a word I said.\r\n\r\n\"The money Wardrop had in the grip--that's easy enough explained,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Fleming used the Borough Bank to deposit state funds in. He must\r\nhave known it was rotten: he and Clarkson were as thick as thieves.\r\nAccording to a time-honored custom in our land of the brave and home of\r\nthe free, a state treasurer who is crooked can, in such a case, draw on\r\nsuch a bank without security, on his personal note, which is usually\r\nworth its value by the pound as old paper.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Fleming did that?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did. Then things got bad at the Borough Bank. Fleming had had to\r\ndivide with Schwartz and the Lord only knows who all, but it was Fleming\r\nwho had to put in the money to avert a crash--the word crash being\r\nsynonymous with scandal in this case. He scrapes together a paltry\r\nhundred thousand, which Wardrop gets at the capital, and brings on.\r\nWardrop is robbed, or says he is: the bank collapses and Clarkson,\r\ndriven to the wall, kills himself, just after Fleming is murdered. What\r\ndoes that sound like?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like Clarkson!\" I exclaimed. \"And Clarkson knew Fleming was hiding at\r\nthe White Cat!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, take the other theory,\" he said, pushing aside his cup.\r\n\"Wardrop goes in to Fleming with a story that he has been robbed:\r\nFleming gets crazy and attacks him. All that is in the morning--Friday.\r\nNow, then--Wardrop goes back there that night. Within twenty minutes\r\nafter he enters the club he rushes out, and when Hunter follows him, he\r\nsays he is looking for a doctor, to get cocaine for a gentleman\r\nup-stairs. He is white and trembling. They go back together, and find\r\nyou there, and Fleming dead. Wardrop tells two stories: first he says\r\nFleming committed suicide just before he left. Then he changes it and\r\nsays he was dead when he arrived there. He produces the weapon with\r\nwhich Fleming is supposed to have killed himself, and which, by the way,\r\nMiss Fleming identified yesterday as her father's. But there are two\r\ndiscrepancies. Wardrop practically admitted that he had taken that\r\nrevolver from Fleming, not that night, but the morning before, during\r\nthe quarrel.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the other discrepancy?\"\r\n\r\n\"The bullet. Nobody ever fired a thirty-two bullet out of a\r\nthirty-eight caliber revolver--unless he was trying to shoot a\r\ndouble-compound curve. Now, then, who does it look like?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like Wardrop,\" I confessed. \"By Jove, they didn't both do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he didn't do it himself for two good reasons: he had no revolver\r\nthat night, and there were no powder marks.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the eleven twenty-two, and Miss Maitland's disappearance?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with his quizzical smile.\r\n\r\n\"I'll have to have another steak, if I'm to settle that,\" he said. \"I\r\ncan only solve one murder on one steak. But disappearances are my\r\nspecialty; perhaps, if I have a piece of pie and some cheese--\"\r\n\r\nBut I got him away at last, and we walked together down the street.\r\n\r\n\"I can't quite see the old lady in it,\" he confessed. \"She hadn't any\r\ngrudge against Fleming, had she? Wouldn't be likely to forget herself\r\ntemporarily and kill him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" I said. \"Why, she's sixty-five, and as timid and gentle a\r\nlittle old lady as ever lived.\"\r\n\r\n\"Curls?\" he asked, turning his bright blue eyes on me.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I admitted.\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't be likely to have eloped with the minister, or advertised for\r\na husband, or anything like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"You would have to know her to understand,\" I said resignedly. \"But she\r\ndidn't do any of those things, and she didn't run off to join a\r\ntheatrical troupe. Burton, who do you think was in the Fleming house\r\nlast night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lightfoot,\" he said succinctly.\r\n\r\nHe stopped under a street lamp and looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n\"I believe I'll run over to the capital to-night,\" he said. \"While I'm\r\ngone--I'll be back to-morrow night or the next morning--I wish you would\r\ndo two things. Find Rosie O'Grady, or whatever her name is, and locate\r\nCarter. That's probably not his name, but it will answer for a while.\r\nThen get your friend Hunter to keep him in sight for a while, until I\r\ncome back anyhow. I'm beginning to enjoy this; it's more fun than a\r\npicture puzzle. We're going to make the police department look like a\r\nkindergarten playing jackstraws.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the second thing I am to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to Bellwood and find out a few things. It's all well enough to say\r\nthe old lady was a meek and timid person, but if you want to know her\r\npeculiarities, go to her neighbors. When people leave the beaten path,\r\nthe neighbors always know it before the families.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped before a drug-store.\r\n\r\n\"I'll have to pack for my little jaunt,\" he said, and purchased a\r\ntooth-brush, which proved to be the extent of his preparations. We\r\nseparated at the station, Burton to take his red hair and his\r\ntooth-brush to Plattsburg, I to take a taxicab, and armed with a page\r\ntorn from the classified directory to inquire at as many of the twelve\r\nAnderson's drug-stores as might be necessary to locate Delia's gentleman\r\nfriend, \"the clerk,\" through him Delia, and through Delia, the\r\nmysterious Carter, \"who was not really a butler.\"\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me somewhat tardily, that I knew nothing of Delia but her\r\ngiven name. A telephone talk with Margery was of little assistance:\r\nDelia had been a new maid, and if she had heard her other name, she had\r\nforgotten it.\r\n\r\nI had checked off eight of the Andersons on my list, without result, and\r\nthe taximeter showed something over nineteen dollars, when the driver\r\ndrew up at the curb.\r\n\r\n\"Gentleman in the other cab is hailing you, sir,\" he said over his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"The other cab?\"\r\n\r\n\"The one that has been following us.\"\r\n\r\nI opened the door and glanced behind. A duplicate of my cab stood\r\nperhaps fifty feet behind, and from it a familiar figure was slowly\r\nemerging, carrying on a high-pitched argument with the chauffeur. The\r\nfigure stopped to read the taximeter, shook his fist at the chauffeur,\r\nand approached me, muttering audibly. It was Davidson.\r\n\r\n\"That liar and thief back there has got me rung up for nineteen\r\ndollars,\" he said, ignoring my amazement. \"Nineteen dollars and forty\r\ncents! He must have the thing counting the revolutions of all four\r\nwheels!\"\r\n\r\nHe walked around and surveyed my expense account, at the driver's elbow.\r\nThen he hit the meter a smart slap, but the figures did not change.\r\n\r\n\"Nineteen dollars!\" he repeated dazed. \"Nineteen dollars and--look\r\nhere,\" he called to his driver, who had brought the cab close, \"it's\r\nonly thirty cents here. Your clock's ten cents fast.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how--\" I began.\r\n\r\n\"You back up to nineteen dollars and thirty cents,\" he persisted,\r\nignoring me. \"If you'll back up to twelve dollars, I'll pay it. That's\r\nall I've got.\" Then he turned on me irritably. \"Good heavens, man,\" he\r\nexclaimed, \"do you mean to tell me you've been to eight drug-stores this\r\nSunday evening and spent nineteen dollars and thirty cents, and haven't\r\ngot a drink yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I'm after a drink?\" I asked him. \"Now look here, Davidson,\r\nI rather think you know what I am after. If you don't, it doesn't\r\nmatter. But since you are coming along anyhow, pay your man off and come\r\nwith me. I don't like to be followed.\"\r\n\r\nHe agreed without hesitation, borrowed eight dollars from me to augment\r\nhis twelve and crawled in with me.\r\n\r\n\"The next address on the list is the right one,\" he said, as the man\r\nwaited for directions. \"I did the same round yesterday, but not being a\r\nplutocrat, I used the street-cars and my legs. And because you're a\r\ndecent fellow and don't have to be chloroformed to have an idea\r\ninjected, I'm going to tell you something. There were eleven roundsmen\r\nas well as the sergeant who heard me read the note I found at the\r\nFleming house that night. You may have counted them through the window.\r\nA dozen plain-clothes men read it before morning. When the news of Mr.\r\nFleming's mur--death came out, I thought this fellow Carter might know\r\nsomething, and I trailed Delia through this Mamie Brennan. When I got\r\nthere I found Tom Brannigan and four other detectives sitting in the\r\nparlor, and Miss Delia, in a blue silk waist, making eyes at every\r\nmother's son of them.\"\r\n\r\nI laughed in spite of my disappointment. Davidson leaned forward and\r\nclosed the window at the driver's back. Then he squared around and faced\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"Understand me, Mr. Knox,\" he said, \"Mr. Fleming killed himself. You and\r\nI are agreed on that. Even if you aren't just convinced of it I'm\r\ntelling you, and--better let it drop, sir,\" Under his quiet manner I\r\nfelt a threat: it served to rouse me.\r\n\r\n\"I'll let it drop when I'm through with it,\" I asserted, and got out my\r\nlist of addresses.\r\n\r\n\"You'll let it drop because it's too hot to hold,\" he retorted, with the\r\nsuspicion of a smile. \"If you are determined to know about Carter, I can\r\ntell you everything that is necessary.\"\r\n\r\nThe chauffeur stopped his engine with an exasperated jerk and settled\r\ndown in his seat, every line of his back bristling with irritation.\r\n\r\n\"I prefer learning from Carter himself.\"\r\n\r\nHe leaned back in his seat and produced an apple from the pocket of his\r\ncoat.\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to travel some to do it, son,\" he said. \"Carter left for\r\nparts unknown last night, taking with him enough money to keep him in\r\ncomfort for some little time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Until all this blows over,\" I said bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"The trip was for the benefit of his health. He has been suffering--and\r\nis still suffering, from a curious lapse of memory.\" Davidson smiled at\r\nme engagingly. \"He has entirely forgotten everything that occurred from\r\nthe time he entered Mr. Fleming's employment, until that gentleman left\r\nhome. I doubt if he will ever recover.\"\r\n\r\nWith Carter gone, his retreat covered by the police, supplied with funds\r\nfrom some problematical source, further search for him was worse than\r\nuseless. In fact, Davidson strongly intimated that it might be dangerous\r\nand would be certainly unpleasant. I yielded ungraciously and ordered\r\nthe cab to take me home. But on the way I cursed my folly for not having\r\nfollowed this obvious clue earlier, and I wondered what this thing could\r\nbe that Carter knew, that was at least surmised by various headquarters\r\nmen, and yet was so carefully hidden from the world at large.\r\n\r\nThe party newspapers had come out that day with a signed statement from\r\nMr. Fleming's physician in Plattsburg that he had been in ill health and\r\ninclined to melancholia for some time. The air was thick with rumors of\r\ndifferences with his party: the dust cloud covered everything; pretty\r\nsoon it would settle and hide the tracks of those who had hurried to\r\ncover under its protection.\r\n\r\nDavidson left me at a corner down-town. He turned to give me a parting\r\nadmonition.\r\n\r\n\"There's an old axiom in the mills around here, 'never sit down on a\r\npiece of metal until you spit on it.' If it sizzles, don't sit.\" He\r\ngrinned. \"Your best position just now, young man, is standing, with your\r\nhands over your head. Confidentially, there ain't anything within\r\nexpectorating distance just now that ain't pretty well het up.\"\r\n\r\nHe left me with that, and I did not see him again until the night at the\r\nWhite Cat, when he helped put me through the transom. Recently, however,\r\nI have met him several times. He invariably mentions the eight dollars\r\nand his intention of repaying it. Unfortunately, the desire and the\r\nability have not yet happened to coincide.\r\n\r\nI took the evening train to Bellwood, and got there shortly after eight,\r\nin the midst of the Sunday evening calm, and the calm of a place like\r\nBellwood is the peace of death without the hope of resurrection.\r\n\r\nI walked slowly up the main street, which was lined with residences; the\r\ntown relegated its few shops to less desirable neighborhoods. My first\r\nintention had been to see the Episcopal minister, but the rectory was\r\ndark, and a burst of organ music from the church near reminded me again\r\nof the Sunday evening services.\r\n\r\nPromiscuous inquiry was not advisable. So far, Miss Jane's disappearance\r\nwas known to very few, and Hunter had advised caution. I wandered up the\r\nstreet and turned at random to the right; a few doors ahead a newish red\r\nbrick building proclaimed itself the post-office, and gave the only sign\r\nof life in the neighborhood. It occurred to me that here inside was the\r\none individual who, theoretically at least, in a small place always\r\nknows the idiosyncrasies of its people.\r\n\r\nThe door was partly open, for the spring night was sultry. The\r\npostmaster proved to be a one-armed veteran of the Civil War, and he was\r\nsorting rapidly the contents of a mail-bag, emptied on the counter.\r\n\r\n\"No delivery to-night,\" he said shortly. \"Sunday delivery, two to\r\nthree.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose, then, I couldn't get a dollar's worth of stamps,\" I\r\nregretted.\r\n\r\nHe looked up over his glasses.\r\n\r\n\"We don't sell stamps on Sunday nights,\" he explained, more politely.\r\n\"But if you're in a hurry for them--\"\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" I lied. And after he had got them out, counting them with a\r\nwrinkled finger, and tearing them off the sheet with the deliberation of\r\nage, I opened a general conversation.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you do a good bit of business here?\" I asked. \"It seems like\r\na thriving place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so bad; big mail here sometimes. First of the quarter, when bills\r\nare coming round, we have a rush, and holidays and Easter we've got to\r\nhire an express wagon.\"\r\n\r\nIt was when I asked him about his empty sleeve, however, and he had told\r\nme that he lost his arm at Chancellorsville, that we became really\r\nfriendly When he said he had been a corporal in General Maitland's\r\ncommand, my path was one of ease.\r\n\r\n\"The Maitland ladies! I should say I do,\" he said warmly. \"I've been\r\nfighting with Letitia Maitland as long as I can remember. That woman\r\nwill scrap with the angel Gabriel at the resurrection, if he wakes her\r\nup before she's had her sleep out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Jane is not that sort, is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Jane? She's an angel--she is that. She could have been married a\r\ndozen times when she was a girl, but Letitia wouldn't have it. I was\r\nafter her myself, forty-five years ago. This was the Maitland farm in\r\nthose days, and my father kept a country store down where the railroad\r\nstation is now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose from that the Maitland ladies are wealthy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wealthy! They don't know what they're worth--not that it matters a mite\r\nto Jane Maitland. She hasn't called her soul her own for so long that I\r\nguess the good Lord won't hold her responsible for it.\"\r\n\r\nAll of which was entertaining, but it was much like an old-fashioned\r\nsee-saw; it kept going, but it didn't make much progress. But now at\r\nlast we took a step ahead.\r\n\r\n\"It's a shameful thing,\" the old man pursued, \"that a woman as old as\r\nJane should have to get her letters surreptitiously. For more than a\r\nyear now she's been coming here twice a week for her mail, and I've been\r\nkeeping it for her. Rain or shine, Mondays and Thursdays, she's been\r\ncoming, and a sight of letters she's been getting, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she come last Thursday?\" I asked over-eagerly. The postmaster, all\r\nat once, regarded me with suspicion.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know whether she did or not,\" he said coldly, and my further\r\nattempts to beguile him into conversation failed. I pocketed my stamps,\r\nand by that time his resentment at my curiosity was fading. He followed\r\nme to the door, and lowered his voice cautiously.\r\n\r\n\"Any news of the old lady?\" he asked. \"It ain't generally known around\r\nhere that she's missing, but Heppie, the cook there, is a relation of my\r\nwife's.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have no news,\" I replied, \"and don't let it get around, will you?\"\r\n\r\nHe promised gravely.\r\n\r\n\"I was tellin' the missus the other day,\" he said, \"that there is an old\r\nwalled-up cellar under the Maitland place. Have you looked there?\" He\r\nwas disappointed when I said we had, and I was about to go when he\r\ncalled me back.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Jane didn't get her mail on Thursday, but on Friday that niece of\r\nhers came for it--two letters, one from the city and one from New York.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" I returned, and went out into the quiet street.\r\n\r\nI walked past the Maitland place, but the windows were dark and the\r\nhouse closed. Haphazard inquiry being out of the question, I took the\r\nten o'clock train back to the city. I had learned little enough, and\r\nthat little I was at a loss to know how to use. For why had Margery gone\r\nfor Miss Jane's mail _after_ the little lady was missing? And why did\r\nMiss Jane carry on a clandestine correspondence?\r\n\r\nThe family had retired when I got home except Fred, who called from his\r\nstudy to ask for a rhyme for mosque. I could not think of one and\r\nsuggested that he change the word to \"temple.\" At two o'clock he banged\r\non my door in a temper, said he had changed the rhythm to fit, and now\r\ncouldn't find a rhyme for \"temple!\" I suggested \"dimple\" drowsily,\r\nwhereat he kicked the panel of the door and went to bed.\r\n\nThe funeral occurred on Monday. It was an ostentatious affair, with a\r\nlong list of honorary pall-bearers, a picked corps of city firemen in\r\nuniform ranged around the casket, and enough money wasted in floral\r\npillows and sheaves of wheat tied with purple ribbon, to have given all\r\nthe hungry children in town a square meal.\r\n\r\nAmid all this state Margery moved, stricken and isolated. She went to\r\nthe cemetery with Edith, Miss Letitia having sent a message that, having\r\nnever broken her neck to see the man living, she wasn't going to do it\r\nto see him dead. The music was very fine, and the eulogy spoke of this\r\npatriot who had served his country so long and so well. \"Following the\r\nflag,\" Fred commented under his breath, \"as long as there was an\r\nappropriation attached to it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when it was all over, we went back to Fred's until the Fleming house\r\ncould be put into order again. It was the best place in the world for\r\nMargery, for, with the children demanding her attention and applause\r\nevery minute, she had no time to be blue.\r\n\r\nMrs. Butler arrived that day, which made Fred suspicious that Edith's\r\nplan to bring her, far antedated his consent. But she was there when we\r\ngot home from the funeral, and after one glimpse at her thin face and\r\nhollow eyes, I begged Edith to keep her away from Margery, for that day\r\nat least.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Mrs. Butler was exhausted by her journey, and retired to\r\nher room almost immediately. I watched her slender figure go up the\r\nstairs, and, with her black trailing gown and colorless face, she was an\r\nembodiment of all that is lonely and helpless. Fred closed the door\r\nbehind her and stood looking at Edith and me.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you, honey,\" he declared, \"_that_ brought into a cheerful home\r\nis sufficient cause for divorce. Isn't it, Jack?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is ill,\" Edith maintained valiantly. \"She is my cousin, too, which\r\ngives her some claim on me, and my guest, which gives her more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lady-love,\" Fred said solemnly, \"if you do not give me the key to the\r\ncellarette, I shall have a chill. And let me beg this of you: if I ever\r\nget tired of this life, and shuffle off my mortality in a lumber yard,\r\nor a political club, and you go around like that, I shall haunt you. I\r\nswear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shuffle off,\" I dared him. \"I will see that Edith is cheerful and\r\nhappy.\"\r\n\r\nFrom somewhere above, there came a sudden crash, followed by the\r\nannouncement, made by a scared housemaid, that Mrs. Butler had fainted.\r\nFred sniffed as Edith scurried up-stairs.\r\n\r\n\"Hipped,\" he said shortly. \"For two cents I'd go up and give her a good\r\nwhiff of ammonia--not this aromatic stuff, but the genuine article. That\r\nwould make her sit up and take notice. Upon my word, I can't think what\r\npossessed Edith; these spineless, soft-spoken, timid women are leeches\r\non one's sympathies.\"\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Butler was really ill, and Margery insisted on looking after\r\nher. It was an odd coincidence, the widow of one state treasurer and the\r\norphaned daughter of his successor; both men had died violent deaths,\r\nin each case when a boiling under the political lid had threatened to\r\nblow it off.\r\n\r\nThe boys were allowed to have their dinner with the family that evening,\r\nin honor of Mrs. Butler's arrival, and it was a riotous meal. Margery\r\ngot back a little of her color. As I sat across from her, and watched\r\nher expressions change, from sadness to resignation, and even gradually\r\nto amusement at the boys' antics, I wondered just how much she knew, or\r\nsuspected, that she refused to tell me.\r\n\r\nI remembered a woman--a client of mine--who said that whenever she sat\r\nnear a railroad track and watched an engine thundering toward her, she\r\ntortured herself by picturing a child on the track, and wondering\r\nwhether, under such circumstances, she would risk her life to save the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nI felt a good bit that way; I was firmly embarked on the case now, and I\r\ntortured myself with one idea. Suppose I should find Wardrop guilty, and\r\nI should find extenuating circumstances--what would I do? Publish the\r\ntruth, see him hanged or imprisoned, and break Margery's heart? Or keep\r\nback the truth, let her marry him, and try to forget that I had had a\r\nhand in the whole wretched business?\r\n\r\nAfter all, I decided to try to stop my imaginary train. Prove Wardrop\r\ninnocent, I reasoned with myself, get to the bottom of this thing, and\r\nthen--it would be man and man. A fair field and no favor. I suppose my\r\nproper attitude, romantically taken, was to consider Margery's\r\nengagement ring an indissoluble barrier. But this was not romance; I was\r\nfighting for my life happiness, and as to the ring--well, I am of the\r\nopinion that if a man really loves a woman, and thinks he can make her\r\nhappy, he will tell her so if she is strung with engagement rings to the\r\nends of her fingers. Dangerous doctrine? Well, this is not propaganda.\r\n\r\nTuesday found us all more normal. Mrs. Butler had slept some, and very\r\ncommendably allowed herself to be tea'd and toasted in bed. The boys\r\nwere started to kindergarten, after ten minutes of frenzied cap-hunting.\r\nMargery went with me along the hall when I started for the office.\r\n\r\n\"You have not learned anything?\" she asked cautiously, glancing back to\r\nEdith, at the telephone calling the grocer frantically for the Monday\r\nmorning supply of soap and starch.\r\n\r\n\"Not much,\" I evaded. \"Nothing definite, anyhow. Margery, you are not\r\ngoing back to the Monmouth Avenue house again, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not just yet; I don't think I could. I suppose, later, it will have to\r\nbe sold, but not at once. I shall go to Aunt Letitia's first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" I said. \"Then you are going to take a walk with me this\r\nafternoon in the park. I won't take no; you need the exercise, and I\r\nneed--to talk to you,\" I finished lamely.\r\n\r\nWhen she had agreed I went to the office. It was not much after nine,\r\nbut, to my surprise, Burton was already there. He had struck up an\r\nacquaintance with Miss Grant, the stenographer, and that usually frigid\r\nperson had melted under the warmth of his red hair and his smile. She\r\nwas telling him about her sister's baby having the whooping-cough, when\r\nI went in.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I had studied law,\" he threw at me. \"'What shall it profit a man\r\nto become a lawyer and lose his own soul?' as the psalmist says. I like\r\nthis ten-to-four business.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we had gone into the inner office, and shut out Miss Grant and the\r\nwhooping-cough, he was serious instantly.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, sitting on the radiator and dangling his foot, \"I guess\r\nwe've got Wardrop for theft, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Theft?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Well, larceny, if you prefer legal terms. I found where he sold the\r\npearls--in Plattsburg, to a wholesale jeweler named, suggestively,\r\nCashdollar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" I said conclusively, \"if he took the pearls and sold them, as\r\nsure as I sit here, he took the money out of that Russia leather bag.\"\r\n\r\nBurton swung his foot rhythmically against the pipes.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not so darned sure of it,\" he said calmly.\r\n\r\nIf he had any reason, he refused to give it. I told him, in my turn, of\r\nCarter's escape, aided by the police, and he smiled. \"For a suicide it's\r\ncausing a lot of excitement,\" he remarked. When I told him the little\r\nincident of the post-office, he was much interested.\r\n\r\n\"The old lady's in it, somehow,\" he maintained. \"She may have been\r\nlending Fleming money, for one thing. How do you know it wasn't her\r\nhundred thousand that was stolen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think she ever had the uncontrolled disposal of a dollar in her\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's only one thing to do,\" Burton said finally, \"and that is, find\r\nMiss Jane. If she's alive, she can tell something. I'll stake my\r\nfountain pen on that--and it's my dearest possession on earth, next to\r\nmy mother. If Miss Jane is dead--well, somebody killed her, and it's\r\ntime it was being found out.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's easy enough to say find her.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's easy enough to find her,\" he exploded. \"Make a noise about it;\r\nsend up rockets. Put a half-column ad in every paper in town, or--better\r\nstill--give the story to the reporters and let them find her for you.\r\nI'd do it, if I wasn't tied up with this Fleming case. Describe her, how\r\nshe walked, what she liked to eat, what she wore--in this case what she\r\ndidn't wear. Lord, I wish I had that assignment! In forty-eight hours\r\nshe will have been seen in a hundred different places, and one of them\r\nwill be right. It will be a question of selection--that is, if she is\r\nalive.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of his airy tone, I knew he was serious, and I felt he was\r\nright. The publicity part of it I left to him, and I sent a special\r\ndelivery that morning to Bellwood, asking Miss Letitia to say nothing\r\nand to refer reporters to me. I had already been besieged with them,\r\nsince my connection with the Fleming case, and a few more made no\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nBurton attended to the matter thoroughly. The one o'clock edition of an\r\nafternoon paper contained a short and vivid scarlet account of Miss\r\nJane's disappearance. The evening editions were full, and while vague as\r\nto the manner of her leaving, were minute as regarded her personal\r\nappearance and characteristics.\r\n\r\nTo escape the threatened inundation of the morning paper men, I left the\r\noffice early, and at four o'clock Margery and I stepped from a hill car\r\ninto the park. She had been wearing a short, crepe-edged veil, but once\r\naway from the gaze of the curious, she took it off. I was glad to see\r\nshe had lost the air of detachment she had worn for the last three days.\r\n\r\n\"Hold your shoulders well back,\" I directed, when we had found an\r\nisolated path, \"and take long breaths. Try breathing in while I count\r\nten.\"\r\n\r\nShe was very tractable--unusually so, I imagined, for her. We swung\r\nalong together for almost a half-hour, hardly talking. I was content\r\nmerely to be with her, and the sheer joy of the exercise after her\r\nenforced confinement kept her silent. When she began to flag a little I\r\nfound a bench, and we sat down together. The bench had been lately\r\npainted, and although it seemed dry enough, I spread my handkerchief for\r\nher to sit on. Whereupon she called me \"Sir Walter,\" and at the familiar\r\njest we laughed like a pair of children.\r\n\r\nI had made the stipulation that, for this one time, her father's death\r\nand her other troubles should be taboo, and we adhered to it\r\nreligiously. A robin in the path was industriously digging out a worm;\r\nhe had tackled a long one, and it was all he could manage. He took the\r\navailable end in his beak and hopped back with the expression of one who\r\nsets his jaws and determines that this which should be, is to be. The\r\nworm stretched into a pinkish and attenuated line, but it neither broke\r\nnor gave.\r\n\r\n\"Horrid thing!\" Margery said. \"That is a disgraceful, heartless\r\nexhibition.\"\r\n\r\n\"The robin is a parent,\" I reminded her. \"It is precisely the same as\r\nFred, who twists, jerks, distorts and attenuates the English language in\r\nhis magazine work, in order to have bread and ice-cream and jelly cake\r\nfor his two blooming youngsters.\"\r\n\r\nShe had taken off her gloves, and sat with her hands loosely clasped in\r\nher lap.\r\n\r\n\"I wish some one depended on me,\" she said pensively. \"It's a terrible\r\nthing to feel that it doesn't matter to any one--not vitally,\r\nanyhow--whether one is around or not. To have all my responsibilities\r\ntaken away at once, and just to drift around, like this--oh, it's\r\ndreadful.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were going to be good,\" I reminded her.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't promise to be cheerful,\" she returned. \"Besides my father,\r\nthere was only one person in the world who cared about me, and I don't\r\nknow where she is. Dear Aunt Jane!\"\r\n\r\nThe sunlight caught the ring on her engagement finger, and she flushed\r\nsuddenly as she saw me looking at it. We sat there for a while saying\r\nnothing; the long May afternoon was coming to a close. The paths began\r\nto fill with long lines of hurrying home-seekers, their day in office or\r\nfactory at an end.\r\n\r\nMargery got up at last and buttoned her coat. Then impulsively she held\r\nout her hand to me.\r\n\r\n\"You have been more than kind to me,\" she said hurriedly. \"You have\r\ntaken me into your home--and helped me through these dreadful days--and\r\nI will never forget it; never.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not virtuous,\" I replied, looking down at her. \"I couldn't help\r\nit. You walked into my life when you came to my office--was it only last\r\nweek? The evil days are coming, I suppose, but just now nothing matters\r\nat all, save that you are you, and I am I.\"\r\n\r\nShe dropped her veil quickly, and we went back to the car. The prosaic\r\nworld wrapped us around again; there was a heavy odor of restaurant\r\ncoffee in the air; people bumped and jolted past us. To me they were\r\nonly shadows; the real world was a girl in black and myself, and the\r\ngirl wore a betrothal ring which was not mine.\r\n\nMrs. Butler came down to dinner that night. She was more cheerful than I\r\nhad yet seen her, and she had changed her mournful garments to something\r\na trifle less depressing. With her masses of fair hair dressed high, and\r\nher face slightly animated, I realized what I had not done before--that\r\nshe was the wreck of a very beautiful woman. Frail as she was, almost\r\nshrinkingly timid in her manner, there were times when she drew up her\r\ntall figure in something like its former stateliness. She had beautiful\r\neyebrows, nearly black and perfectly penciled; they were almost\r\nincongruous in her colorless face.\r\n\r\nShe was very weak; she used a cane when she walked, and after dinner, in\r\nthe library, she was content to sit impassive, detached, propped with\r\ncushions, while Margery read to the boys in their night nursery and\r\nEdith embroidered.\r\n\r\nFred had been fussing over a play for some time, and he had gone to read\r\nit to some manager or other. Edith was already spending the royalties.\r\n\r\n\"We could go a little ways out of town,\" she was saying, \"and we could\r\nhave an automobile; Margery says theirs will be sold, and it will\r\ncertainly be a bargain. Jack, are you laughing at me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly _not_,\" I replied gravely. \"Dream on, Edith. Shall we train\r\nthe boys as chauffeurs, or shall we buy in the Fleming man, also cheap.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure,\" Edith said aggrieved, \"that it costs more for horse feed\r\nthis minute for your gray, Jack, than it would for gasolene.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Lady Gray won't eat gasolene,\" I protested. \"She doesn't like it.\"\r\n\r\nEdith turned her back on me and sewed. Near me, Mrs. Butler had\r\nlanguidly taken up the paper; suddenly she dropped it, and when I\r\nstooped and picked it up I noticed she was trembling.\r\n\r\n\"Is it true?\" she demanded. \"Is Robert Clarkson dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I assented. \"He has been dead since Sunday morning--a suicide.\"\r\n\r\nEdith had risen and come over to her. But Mrs. Butler was not fainting.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad, glad,\" she said. Then she grew weak and semi-hysterical,\r\nlaughing and crying in the same breath. When she had been helped\r\nup-stairs, for in her weakened state it had been more of a shock than we\r\nrealized, Margery came down and we tried to forget the scene we had just\r\ngone through.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad Fred was not here,\" Edith confided to me. \"Ellen is a lovely\r\nwoman, and as kind as she is mild; but in one of her--attacks, she is a\r\nlittle bit trying.\"\r\n\r\nIt was strange to contrast the way in which the two women took their\r\nsimilar bereavements. Margery represented the best type of normal\r\nAmerican womanhood; Ellen Butler the neurasthenic; she demanded\r\neverything by her very helplessness and timidity. She was a constant\r\ndrain on Edith's ready sympathy. That night, while I closed the\r\nhouse--Fred had not come in--I advised her to let Mrs. Butler go back to\r\nher sanatorium.\r\n\r\nAt twelve-thirty I was still down-stairs; Fred was out, and I waited\r\nfor him, being curious to know the verdict on the play. The bell rang a\r\nfew minutes before one, and I went to the door; some one in the\r\nvestibule was tapping the floor impatiently with his foot. When I opened\r\nthe door, I was surprised to find that the late visitor was Wardrop.\r\n\r\nHe came in quietly, and I had a chance to see him well, under the hall\r\nlight; the change three days had made was shocking. His eyes were sunk\r\ndeep in his head, his reddened lids and twitching mouth told of little\r\nsleep, of nerves ready to snap. He was untidy, too, and a three days'\r\nbeard hardly improved him.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad it's you,\" he said, by way of greeting. \"I was afraid you'd\r\nhave gone to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the top of the evening yet,\" I replied perfunctorily, as I led the\r\nway into the library. Once inside, Wardrop closed the door and looked\r\naround him like an animal at bay.\r\n\r\n\"I came here,\" he said nervously, looking at the windows, \"because I had\r\nan idea you'd keep your head. Mine's gone; I'm either crazy, or I'm on\r\nmy way there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, man,\" I pushed a chair to him. \"You don't look as if you have\r\nbeen in bed for a couple of nights.\"\r\n\r\nHe went to each of the windows and examined the closed shutters before\r\nhe answered me.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't. You wouldn't go to bed either, if you thought you would\r\nnever wake up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's true enough. Knox, there are people following me wherever I\r\ngo; they eat where I eat; if I doze in my chair they come into my\r\ndreams!\" He stopped there, then he laughed a little wildly. \"That last\r\nisn't sane, but it's true. There's a man across the street now, eating\r\nan apple under a lamppost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you _are_ under surveillance,\" I said. \"It's annoying to have a\r\ndetective following you around, but it's hardly serious. The police say\r\nnow that Mr. Fleming killed himself; that was your own contention.\"\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward in his chair and, resting his hands on his knees,\r\ngazed at me somberly.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose I say he didn't kill himself?\" slowly. \"Suppose I say he was\r\nmurdered? Suppose--good God--suppose I killed him myself?\"\r\n\r\nI drew back in stupefaction, but he hurried on.\r\n\r\n\"For the last two days I've been wondering--if I did it! He hadn't any\r\nweapon; I had one, his. I hated him that day; I had tried to save him,\r\nand couldn't. My God, Knox, I might have gone off my head and done\r\nit--and not remember it. There have been cases like that.\"\r\n\r\nHis condition was pitiable. I looked around for some whisky, but the\r\nbest I could do was a little port on the sideboard. When I came back he\r\nwas sitting with bent head, his forehead on his palms.\r\n\r\n\"I've thought it all out,\" he said painfully. \"My mother had spells of\r\nemotional insanity. Perhaps I went there, without knowing it, and killed\r\nhim. I can see him, in the night, when I daren't sleep, toppling over on\r\nto that table, with a bullet wound in his head, and I am in the room,\r\nand I have his revolver in my pocket!\"\r\n\r\n\"You give me your word you have no conscious recollection of hearing a\r\nshot fired.\"\r\n\r\n\"My word before Heaven,\" he said fervently. \"But I tell you, Knox, he\r\nhad no weapon. No one came out of that room as I went in and yet he was\r\nonly swaying forward, as if I had shot him one moment, and caught him as\r\nhe fell, the next. I was dazed; I don't remember yet what I told the\r\npolice.\"\r\n\r\nThe expression of fear in his eyes was terrible to see. A gust of wind\r\nshook the shutters, and he jumped almost out of his chair.\r\n\r\n\"You will have to be careful,\" I said. \"There have been cases where men\r\nconfessed murders they never committed, driven by Heaven knows what\r\nmethod of undermining their mental resistance. Yon expose your\r\nimagination to 'third degree' torture of your own invention, and in two\r\ndays more you will be able to add full details of the crime.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew you would think me crazy,\" he put in, a little less somberly,\r\n\"but just try it once: sit in a room by yourself all day and all night,\r\nwith detectives watching you; sit there and puzzle over a murder of a\r\nman you are suspected of killing; you know you felt like killing him,\r\nand you have a revolver, and he is shot. Wouldn't you begin to think as\r\nI do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wardrop,\" I asked, trying to fix his wavering eyes with mine, \"do you\r\nown a thirty-two caliber revolver?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nI was startled beyond any necessity, under the circumstances. Many\r\npeople have thirty-twos.\r\n\r\n\"That is, I had,\" he corrected himself. \"It was in the leather bag that\r\nwas stolen at Bellwood.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can relieve your mind of one thing,\" I said. \"If your revolver was\r\nstolen with the leather bag, you had nothing to do with the murder.\r\nFleming was shot with a thirty-two.\" He looked first incredulous, then\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then,\" I pursued, \"suppose Mr. Fleming had an enemy, a relentless\r\none who would stoop to anything to compass his ruin. In his position he\r\nwould be likely to have enemies. This person, let us say, knows what you\r\ncarry in your grip, and steals it, taking away the funds that would have\r\nhelped to keep the lid on Fleming's mismanagement for a time. In the\r\ngrip is your revolver; would you know it again?\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded affirmatively.\r\n\r\n\"This person--this enemy finds the revolver, pockets it and at the first\r\nopportunity, having ruined Fleming, proceeds humanely to put him out of\r\nhis suffering. Is it far-fetched?\"\r\n\r\n\"There were a dozen--a hundred--people who would have been glad to ruin\r\nhim.\" His gaze wavered again suddenly. It was evident that I had renewed\r\nan old train of thought.\r\n\r\n\"For instance?\" I suggested, but he was on guard again.\r\n\r\n\"You forget one thing, Knox,\" he said, after a moment. \"There was nobody\r\nelse who could have shot him: the room was empty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" I replied. \"Don't forget the warehouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"The warehouse!\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no doubt in my mind that he was shot from there. He was facing\r\nthe open window, sitting directly under the light, writing. A shot fired\r\nthrough a broken pane of one of the warehouse windows would meet every\r\nrequirement of the case: the empty room, the absence of powder\r\nmarks--even the fact that no shot was heard. There was a report, of\r\ncourse, but the noise in the club-house and the thunder-storm outside\r\ncovered it.\"\r\n\r\n\"By George!\" he exclaimed. \"The warehouse, of course. I never thought of\r\nit.\" He was relieved, for some reason.\r\n\r\n\"It's a question now of how many people knew he was at the club, and\r\nwhich of them hated him enough to kill him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clarkson knew it,\" Wardrop said, \"but he didn't do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it was he who came to the door of the room while the detective\r\nand you and I were inside, and called Fleming.\"\r\n\r\nI pulled out my pocket-book and took out the scrap of paper which\r\nMargery had found pinned to the pillow in her father's bedroom. \"Do you\r\nknow what that means?\" I asked, watching Wardrop's face. \"That was found\r\nin Mr. Fleming's room two days after he left home. A similar scrap was\r\nfound in Miss Jane Maitland's room when she disappeared. When Fleming\r\nwas murdered, he was writing a letter; he said: 'The figures have\r\nfollowed me here.' When we know what those figures mean, Wardrop, we\r\nknow why he was killed and who did it.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head hopelessly.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" he said, and I believed him. He had got up and taken\r\nhis hat, but I stopped him inside the door.\r\n\r\n\"You can help this thing in two ways,\" I told him. \"I am going to give\r\nyou something to do: you will have less time to be morbid. Find out, if\r\nyou can, all about Fleming's private life in the last dozen years,\r\nespecially the last three. See if there are any women mixed up in it,\r\nand try to find out something about this eleven twenty-two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eleven twenty-two,\" he repeated, but I had not missed his change of\r\nexpression when I said women.\r\n\r\n\"Also,\" I went on, \"I want you to tell me who was with you the night you\r\ntried to break into the house at Bellwood.\"\r\n\r\nHe was taken completely by surprise: when he had gathered himself\r\ntogether his perplexity was overdone.\r\n\r\n\"With me!\" he repeated. \"I was alone, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean--the woman at the gate.\"\r\n\r\nHe lost his composure altogether then. I put my back against the door\r\nand waited for him to get himself in hand.\r\n\r\n\"There was a woman,\" I persisted, \"and what is more, Wardrop, at this\r\nminute you believe she took your Russia leather bag and left a\r\nsubstitute.\"\r\n\r\nHe fell into the trap.\r\n\r\n\"But she couldn't,\" he quavered. \"I've thought until my brain is going,\r\nand I don't see how she could have done it.\"\r\n\r\nHe became sullen when he saw what he had done, refused any more\r\ninformation, and left almost immediately.\r\n\r\nFred came soon after, and in the meantime I had made some notes like\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n1. Examine warehouse and yard.\r\n\r\n2. Attempt to trace Carter.\r\n\r\n3. See station agent at Bellwood.\r\n\r\n4. Inquire Wardrop's immediate past.\r\n\r\n5. Take Wardrop to Doctor Anderson, the specialist.\r\n\r\n6. Send Margery violets.\r\n\nBurton's idea of exploiting Miss Jane's disappearance began to bear\r\nfruit the next morning. I went to the office early, anxious to get my\r\nmore pressing business out of the way, to have the afternoon with Burton\r\nto inspect the warehouse. At nine o'clock came a call from the morgue.\r\n\r\n\"Small woman, well dressed, gray hair?\" I repeated. \"I think I'll go up\r\nand see. Where was the body found?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the river at Monica Station,\" was the reply. \"There is a scar\r\ndiagonally across the cheek to the corner of the mouth.\"\r\n\r\n\"A fresh injury?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, an old scar.\"\r\n\r\nWith a breath of relief I said it was not the person we were seeking and\r\ntried to get down to work again. But Burton's prophecy had been right.\r\nMiss Jane had been seen in a hundred different places: one perhaps was\r\nright; which one?\r\n\r\nA reporter for the _Eagle_ had been working on the case all night: he\r\ncame in for a more detailed description of the missing woman, and he had\r\na theory, to fit which he was quite ready to cut and trim the facts.\r\n\r\n\"It's Rowe,\" he said confidently. \"You can see his hand in it right\r\nthrough. I was put on the Benson kidnapping case, you remember, the boy\r\nwho was kept for three months in a deserted lumber camp in the\r\nmountains? Well, sir, every person in the Benson house swore that\r\nyoungster was in bed at midnight, when the house was closed for the\r\nnight. Every door and window bolted in the morning, and the boy gone.\r\nWhen we found Rowe--after the mother had put on mourning--and found the\r\nkid, ten pounds heavier than he had been before he was abducted, and\r\nstrutting around like a turkey cock, Rowe told us that he and the boy\r\ntook in the theater that night, and were there for the first act. How\r\ndid he do it? He offered to take the boy to the show if he would pretend\r\nto go to bed, and then slide down a porch pillar and meet him. The boy\r\ndidn't want to go home when we found him.\"\r\n\r\n\"There can't be any mistake about the time in this case,\" I commented.\r\n\"I saw her myself after eleven, and said good night.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Eagle_ man consulted his note-book. \"Oh, yes,\" he asked; \"did she\r\nhave a diagonal cut across her cheek?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said for the second time.\r\n\r\nMy next visitor was a cabman. On the night in question he had taken a\r\nsmall and a very nervous old woman to the Omega ferry. She appeared\r\nexcited and almost forgot to pay him. She carried a small satchel, and\r\nwore a black veil. What did she look like? She had gray hair, and she\r\nseemed to have a scar on her face that drew the corner of her mouth.\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock I telephoned Burton: \"For Heaven's sake,\" I said, \"if\r\nanybody has lost a little old lady in a black dress, wearing a black\r\nveil, carrying a satchel, and with a scar diagonally across her cheek\r\nfrom her eye to her mouth, I can tell them all about her, and where she\r\nis now.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's funny,\" he said. \"We're stirring up the pool and bringing up\r\nthings we didn't expect. The police have been looking for that woman\r\nquietly for a week: she's the widow of a coal baron, and her\r\nson-in-law's under suspicion of making away with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he didn't,\" I affirmed. \"She committed suicide from an Omega\r\nferry boat and she's at the morgue this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bully,\" he returned. \"Keep on; you'll get lots of clues, and remember\r\none will be right.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not until noon, however, that anything concrete developed. In the\r\ntwo hours between, I had interviewed seven more people. I had followed\r\nthe depressing last hours of the coal baron's widow, and jumped with\r\nher, mentally, into the black river that night. I had learned of a small\r\nfairish-haired girl who had tried to buy cyanide of potassium at three\r\ndrug-stores on the same street, and of a tall light woman who had taken\r\na room for three days at a hotel and was apparently demented.\r\n\r\nAt twelve, however, my reward came. Two men walked in, almost at the\r\nsame time: one was a motorman, in his official clothes, brass buttons\r\nand patches around the pockets. The other was a taxicab driver. Both\r\nhad the uncertain gait of men who by occupation are unused to anything\r\nstationary under them, and each eyed the other suspiciously.\r\n\r\nThe motorman claimed priority by a nose, so I took him first into my\r\nprivate office. His story, shorn of his own opinions at the time and\r\nlater, was as follows:\r\n\r\nOn the night in question, Thursday of the week before, he took his car\r\nout of the barn for the eleven o'clock run. Barney was his conductor.\r\nThey went from the barn, at Hays Street, down-town, and then started out\r\nfor Wynton. The controller blew out, and two or three things went wrong:\r\nall told they lost forty minutes. They got to Wynton at five minutes\r\nafter two; their time there was one-twenty-five.\r\n\r\nThe car went to the bad again at Wynton, and he and Barney tinkered with\r\nit until two-forty. They got it in shape to go back to the barn, but\r\nthat was all. Just as they were ready to start, a passenger got on, a\r\nwoman, alone: a small woman with a brown veil. She wore a black dress or\r\na suit--he was vague about everything but the color, and he noticed her\r\nespecially because she was fidgety and excited. Half a block farther a\r\nman boarded the car, and sat across from the woman. Barney said\r\nafterward that the man tried twice to speak to the woman, but she looked\r\naway each time. No, he hadn't heard what he said.\r\n\r\nThe man got out when the car went into the barn, but the woman stayed\r\non. He and Barney got another car and took it out, and the woman went\r\nwith them. She made a complete round trip this time, going out to Wynton\r\nand back to the end of the line down-town. It was just daylight when she\r\ngot off at last, at First and Day Streets.\r\n\r\nAsked if he had thought at the time that the veiled woman was young or\r\nold, he said he had thought she was probably middle-aged. Very young or\r\nvery old women would not put in the night riding in a street-car. Yes,\r\nhe had had men who rode around a couple of times at night, mostly to\r\nsober up before they went home. But he never saw a woman do it before.\r\n\r\nI took his name and address and thanked him. The chauffeur came next,\r\nand his story was equally pertinent.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the previous Thursday he had been engaged to take a sick\r\nwoman from a down-town hotel to a house at Bellwood. The woman's husband\r\nwas with her, and they went slowly to avoid jolting. It was after twelve\r\nwhen he drove away from the house and started home. At a corner--he did\r\nnot know the names of the streets--a woman hailed the cab and asked him\r\nif he belonged in Bellwood or was going to the city. She had missed the\r\nlast train. When he told her he was going into town, she promptly\r\nengaged him, and showed him where to wait for her, a narrow road off the\r\nmain street.\r\n\r\n\"I waited an hour,\" he finished, \"before she came; I dropped to sleep or\r\nI would have gone without her. About half-past one she came along, and a\r\ngentleman with her. He put her in the cab, and I took her to the city.\r\nWhen I saw in the paper that a lady had disappeared from Bellwood that\r\nnight, I knew right off that it was my party.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you know the man again?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would know his voice, I expect, sir; I could not see much: he wore a\r\nslouch hat and had a traveling-bag of some kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he say to the woman?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"He didn't say much. Before he closed the door, he said, 'You have put\r\nme in a terrible position,' or something like that. From the\r\ntraveling-bag and all, I thought perhaps it was an elopement, and the\r\nlady had decided to throw him down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it a young woman or an old one,\" I asked again. This time the\r\ncabby's tone was assured.\r\n\r\n\"Young,\" he asserted, \"slim and quick: dressed in black, with a black\r\nveil. Soft voice. She got out at Market Square, and I have an idea she\r\ntook a cross-town car there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hardly think it was Miss Maitland,\" I said. \"She was past sixty, and\r\nbesides--I don't think she went that way. Still it is worth following\r\nup. Is that all?\"\r\n\r\nHe fumbled in his pocket, and after a minute brought up a small black\r\npocket-book and held it out to me. It was the small coin purse out of a\r\nleather hand-bag.\r\n\r\n\"She dropped this in the cab, sir,\" he said. \"I took it home to the\r\nmissus--not knowing what else to do with it. It had no money in it--only\r\nthat bit of paper.\"\r\n\r\nI opened the purse and took out a small white card, without engraving.\r\nOn it was written in a pencil the figures:\r\n\r\nC 1122\r\n\nWhen the cabman had gone, I sat down and tried to think things out. As I\r\nhave said many times in the course of this narrative, I lack\r\nimagination: moreover, a long experience of witnesses in court had\r\ntaught me the unreliability of average observation. The very fact that\r\ntwo men swore to having taken solitary women away from Bellwood that\r\nnight, made me doubt if either one had really seen the missing woman.\r\n\r\nOf the two stories, the taxicab driver's was the more probable, as far\r\nas Miss Jane was concerned. Knowing her child-like nature, her timidity,\r\nher shrinking and shamefaced fear of the dark, it was almost incredible\r\nthat she would walk the three miles to Wynton, voluntarily, and from\r\nthere lose herself in the city. Besides, such an explanation would not\r\nfit the blood-stains, or the fact that she had gone, as far as we could\r\nfind out, in her night-clothes.\r\n\r\nStill--she had left the village that night, either by cab or on foot. If\r\nthe driver had been correct in his time, however, the taxicab was almost\r\neliminated; he said the woman got into the cab at one-thirty. It was\r\nbetween one-thirty and one-forty-five when Margery heard the footsteps\r\nin the attic.\r\n\r\nI think for the first time it came to me, that day, that there was at\r\nleast a possibility that Miss Jane had not been attacked, robbed or\r\ninjured: that she had left home voluntarily, under stress of great\r\nexcitement. But if she had, why? The mystery was hardly less for being\r\nstripped of its gruesome details. Nothing in my knowledge of the missing\r\nwoman gave me a clue. I had a vague hope that, if she had gone\r\nvoluntarily, she would see the newspapers and let us know where she was.\r\n\r\nTo my list of exhibits I added the purse with its inclosure. The secret\r\ndrawer of my desk now contained, besides the purse, the slip marked\r\neleven twenty-two that had been pinned to Fleming's pillow; the similar\r\nscrap found over Miss Jane's mantel; the pearl I had found on the floor\r\nof the closet, and the cyanide, which, as well as the bullet, Burton\r\nhad given me. Add to these the still tender place on my head where\r\nWardrop had almost brained me with a chair, and a blue ankle, now\r\nbecoming spotted with yellow, where I had fallen down the dumb-waiter,\r\nand my list of visible reminders of the double mystery grew to eight.\r\n\r\nI was not proud of the part I had played. So far, I had blundered, it\r\nseemed to me, at every point where a blunder was possible. I had fallen\r\nover folding chairs and down a shaft; I had been a half-hour too late to\r\nsave Allan Fleming; I had been up and awake, and Miss Jane had got out\r\nof the house under my very nose. Last, and by no means least, I had\r\nwaited thirty-five years to find the right woman, and when I found her,\r\nsome one else had won her. I was in the depths that day when Burton came\r\nin.\r\n\r\nHe walked into the office jauntily and presented Miss Grant with a club\r\nsandwich neatly done up in waxed paper. Then he came into my private\r\nroom and closed the door behind him.\r\n\r\n\"Avaunt, dull care!\" he exclaimed, taking in my dejected attitude and\r\nexhibits on the desk at a glance. \"Look up and grin, my friend.\" He had\r\nhis hands behind him.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a fool,\" I snapped. \"I'll not grin unless I feel like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Grin, darn you,\" he said, and put something on the desk in front of me.\r\nIt was a Russia leather bag.\r\n\r\n\"_The_ leather bag!\" he pointed proudly.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get it?\" I exclaimed, incredulous. Burton fumbled with\r\nthe lock while he explained.\r\n\r\n\"It was found in Boston,\" he said. \"How do you open the thing, anyhow?\"\r\n\r\nIt was not locked, and I got it open in a minute. As I had expected, it\r\nwas empty.\r\n\r\n\"Then--perhaps Wardrop was telling the truth,\" I exclaimed. \"By Jove,\r\nBurton, he was robbed by the woman in the cab, and he can't tell about\r\nher on account of Miss Fleming! She made a haul, for certain.\"\r\n\r\nI told him then of the two women who had left Bellwood on the night of\r\nMiss Jane's disappearance, and showed him the purse and its inclosure.\r\nThe C puzzled him as it had me. \"It might be anything,\" he said as he\r\ngave it back, \"from a book, chapter and verse in the Bible to a\r\nprescription for rheumatism at a drug-store. As to the lady in the cab,\r\nI think perhaps you are right,\" he said, examining the interior of the\r\nbag, where Wardrop's name in ink told its story. \"Of course, we have\r\nonly Wardrop's word that he brought the bag to Bellwood; if we grant\r\nthat we can grant the rest--that he was robbed, that the thief emptied\r\nthe bag, and either took it or shipped it to Boston.\"\r\n\r\n\"How on earth did you get it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a coincidence. There have been a shrewd lot of baggage thieves\r\nin two or three eastern cities lately, mostly Boston. The method, the\r\npolice say, was something like this--one of them, the chief of the gang,\r\nwould get a wagon, dress like an expressman and go round the depots\r\nlooking at baggage. He would make a mental note of the numbers, go away\r\nand forge a check to match, and secure the pieces he had taken a fancy\r\nto. Then he merely drove around to headquarters, and the trunk was\r\nrifled. The police got on, raided the place, and found, among others,\r\nour Russia leather bag. It was shipped back, empty, to the address\r\ninside, at Bellwood.\"\r\n\r\n\"At Bellwood? Then how--\"\r\n\r\n\"It came while I was lunching with Miss Letitia,\" he said easily. \"We're\r\nvery chummy--thick as thieves. What I want to know is\"--disregarding my\r\nastonishment--\"where is the hundred thousand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Find the woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever hear of Anderson, the nerve specialist?\" he asked, without\r\napparent relevancy.\r\n\r\n\"I have been thinking of him,\" I answered. \"If we could get Wardrop\r\nthere, on some plausible excuse, it would take Anderson about ten\r\nminutes with his instruments and experimental psychology, to know\r\neverything Wardrop ever forgot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go on one condition,\" Burton said, preparing to leave. \"I'll\r\npromise to get Wardrop and have him on the spot at two o'clock\r\nto-morrow, if you'll promise me one thing: if Anderson fixes me with his\r\neye, and I begin to look dotty and tell about my past life, I want you\r\nto take me by the flap of my ear and lead me gently home.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise,\" I said, and Burton left.\r\n\r\nThe recovery of the bag was only one of the many astonishing things that\r\nhappened that day and the following night. Hawes, who knew little of\r\nwhat it all meant, and disapproved a great deal, ended that afternoon by\r\nlocking himself, blinking furiously, in his private office. To Hawes any\r\npractice that was not lucrative was bad practice. About four o'clock,\r\nwhen I had shut myself away from the crowd in the outer office, and was\r\nletting Miss Grant take their depositions as to when and where they had\r\nseen a little old lady, probably demented, wandering around the streets,\r\na woman came who refused to be turned away.\r\n\r\n\"Young woman,\" I heard her say, speaking to Miss Grant, \"he may have\r\nimportant business, but I guess mine's just a little more so.\"\r\n\r\nI interfered then, and let her come in. She was a woman of medium\r\nheight, quietly dressed, and fairly handsome. My first impression was\r\nfavorable; she moved with a certain dignity, and she was not laced,\r\ncrimped or made up. I am more sophisticated now; The Lady Who Tells Me\r\nThings says that the respectable women nowadays, out-rouge, out-crimp\r\nand out-lace the unrespectable.\r\n\r\nHowever, the illusion was gone the moment she began to speak. Her voice\r\nwas heavy, throaty, expressionless. She threw it like a weapon: I am\r\nperfectly honest in saying that for a moment the surprise of her voice\r\noutweighed the remarkable thing she was saying.\r\n\r\n\"I am Mrs. Allan Fleming,\" she said, with a certain husky defiance.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon,\" I said, after a minute. \"You mean--the Allan\r\nFleming who has just died?\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. I could see she was unable, just then, to speak. She had\r\nnerved herself to the interview, but it was evident that there was a\r\nreal grief. She fumbled for a black-bordered handkerchief, and her\r\nthroat worked convulsively. I saw now that she was in mourning.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean,\" I asked incredulously, \"that Mr. Fleming married a second\r\ntime?\"\r\n\r\n\"He married me three years ago, in Plattsburg. I came from there last\r\nnight. I--couldn't leave before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does Miss Fleming know about this second marriage?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Nobody knew about it. I have had to put up with a great deal, Mr.\r\nKnox. It's a hard thing for a woman to know that people are talking\r\nabout her, and all the time she's married as tight as ring and book can\r\ndo it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" I hazarded, \"if that is the case, you have come about the\r\nestate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Estate!\" Her tone was scornful. \"I guess I'll take what's coming to me,\r\nas far as that goes--and it won't be much. No, I came to ask what they\r\nmean by saying Allan Fleming killed himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think he did?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know he did not,\" she said tensely. \"Not only that: I know who did\r\nit. It was Schwartz--Henry Schwartz.\"\r\n\r\n\"Schwartz! But what on earth--\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know Schwartz,\" she said grimly. \"I was married to him for\r\nfifteen years. I took him when he had a saloon in the Fifth Ward, at\r\nPlattsburg. The next year he was alderman: I didn't expect in those days\r\nto see him riding around in an automobile--not but what he was making\r\nmoney--Henry Schwartz is a money-maker. That's why he's boss of the\r\nstate now.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you divorced him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a brute,\" she said vindictively. \"He wanted me to go back to\r\nhim, and I told him I would rather die. I took a big house, and kept\r\nbachelor suites for gentlemen. Mr. Fleming lived there, and--he married\r\nme three years ago. He and Schwartz had to stand together, but they\r\nhated each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Schwartz?\" I meditated. \"Do you happen to know if Senator Schwartz was\r\nin Plattsburg at the time of the mur--of Mr. Fleming's death?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was here in Manchester.\"\r\n\r\n\"He had threatened Mr. Fleming's life?\"\r\n\r\n\"He had already tried to kill him, the day we were married. He stabbed\r\nhim twice, but not deep enough.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at her in wonder. For this woman, not extraordinarily handsome,\r\ntwo men had fought and one had died--according to her story.\r\n\r\n\"I can prove everything I say,\" she went on rapidly. \"I have letters\r\nfrom Mr. Fleming telling me what to do in case he was shot down;\r\nI have papers--canceled notes--that would put Schwartz in the\r\npenitentiary--that is,\" she said cunningly, \"I did have them. Mr.\r\nFleming took them away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you afraid for yourself?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm afraid--afraid he'll get me back yet. It would please him to\r\nsee me crawl back on my knees.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--he can not force you to go back to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he can,\" she shivered. From which I knew she had told me only a\r\npart of her story.\r\n\r\nAfter all she had nothing more to tell. Fleming had been shot; Schwartz\r\nhad been in the city about the Borough Bank; he had threatened Fleming\r\nbefore, but a political peace had been patched; Schwartz knew the White\r\nCat. That was all.\r\n\r\nBefore she left she told me something I had not known.\r\n\r\n\"I know a lot about inside politics,\" she said, as she got up. \"I have\r\nseen the state divided up with the roast at my table, and served around\r\nwith the dessert, and I can tell you something you don't know about\r\nyour White Cat. A back staircase leads to one of the up-stairs rooms,\r\nand shuts off with a locked door. It opens below, out a side entrance,\r\nnot supposed to be used. Only a few know of it. Henry Butler was found\r\ndead at the foot of that staircase.\"\r\n\r\n\"He shot himself, didn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"The police said so,\" she replied, with her grim smile. \"There is such a\r\nthing as murdering a man by driving him to suicide.\"\r\n\r\nShe wrote an address on a card and gave it to me.\r\n\r\n\"Just a minute,\" I said, as she was about to go. \"Have you ever heard\r\nMr. Fleming speak of the Misses Maitland?\"\r\n\r\n\"They were--his first wife's sisters. No, he never talked of them, but\r\nI believe, just before he left Plattsburg, he tried to borrow some money\r\nfrom them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And failed?\"\r\n\r\n\"The oldest one telegraphed the refusal, collect,\" she said, smiling\r\nfaintly.\r\n\r\n\"There is something else,\" I said. \"Did you ever hear of the number\r\neleven twenty-two?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--or--why, yes--\" she said. \"It is the number of my house.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed rather ridiculous, when she had gone, and I sat down to think\r\nit over. It was anticlimax, to say the least. If the mysterious number\r\nmeant only the address of this very ordinary woman, then--it was\r\nprobable her story of Schwartz was true enough. But I could not\r\nreconcile myself to it, nor could I imagine Schwartz, with his great\r\nbulk, skulking around pinning scraps of paper to pillows.\r\n\r\nIt would have been more like the fearlessness and passion of the man to\r\nhave shot Fleming down in the state house corridor, or on the street,\r\nand to have trusted to his influence to set him free. For the first time\r\nit occurred to me that there was something essentially feminine in the\r\nrevenge of the figures that had haunted the dead man.\r\n\r\nI wondered if Mrs. Fleming had told me all, or only half the truth.\r\n\r\nThat night, at the most peaceful spot I had ever known, Fred's home,\r\noccurred another inexplicable affair, one that left us all with racked\r\nnerves and listening, fearful ears.\r\n\nThat was to be Margery's last evening at Fred's. Edith had kept her as\r\nlong as she could, but the girl felt that her place was with Miss\r\nLetitia. Edith was desolate.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what I am going to do without you,\" she said that night\r\nwhen we were all together in the library, with a wood fire, for light\r\nand coziness more than heat. Margery was sitting before the fire, and\r\nwhile the others talked she sat mostly silent, looking into the blaze.\r\n\r\nThe May night was cold and rainy, and Fred had been reading us a poem he\r\nhad just finished, receiving with indifference my comment on it, and\r\nbasking in Edith's rapture.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know yourself what it is about?\" I inquired caustically.\r\n\r\n\"If it's about anything, it isn't poetry,\" he replied. \"Poetry appeals\r\nto the ear: it is primarily sensuous. If it is more than that it ceases\r\nto be poetry and becomes verse.\"\r\n\r\nEdith yawned.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I'm getting old,\" she said, \"I'm getting the nap habit after\r\ndinner. Fred, run up, will you, and see if Katie put blankets over the\r\nboys?\"\r\n\r\nFred stuffed his poem in his pocket and went resignedly up-stairs. Edith\r\nyawned again, and prepared to retire to the den for forty winks.\r\n\r\n\"If Ellen decides to come down-stairs,\" she called back over her\r\nshoulder, \"please come and wake me. She said she felt better and might\r\ncome down.\"\r\n\r\nAt the door she turned, behind Margery's back, and made me a sweeping\r\nand comprehensive signal. She finished it off with a double wink, Edith\r\nhaving never been able to wink one eye alone, and crossing the hall,\r\nclosed the door of the den with an obtrusive bang.\r\n\r\nMargery and I were alone. The girl looked at me, smiled a little, and\r\ndrew a long breath.\r\n\r\n\"It's queer about Edith,\" I said; \"I never before knew her to get drowsy\r\nafter dinner. If she were not beyond suspicion, I would think it a\r\ndeep-laid scheme, and she and Fred sitting and holding hands in a\r\ncorner somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why--a scheme?\" She had folded her hands in her lap, and the\r\neternal ring sparkled malignantly.\r\n\r\n\"They might think I wanted to talk to you,\" I suggested.\r\n\r\n\"To me?\"\r\n\r\n\"To you--The fact is, I do.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps I was morbid about the ring: it seemed to me she lifted her hand\r\nand looked at it.\r\n\r\n\"It's drafty in here: don't you think so?\" she asked suddenly, looking\r\nback of her. Probably she had not meant it, but I got up and closed the\r\ndoor into the hall. When I came back I took the chair next to her, and\r\nfor a moment we said nothing. The log threw out tiny red devil sparks,\r\nand the clock chimed eight, very slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Harry Wardrop was here last night,\" I said, poking down the log with my\r\nheel.\r\n\r\n\"Here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I suppose I was wrong, but I did not say you were here.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned and looked at me closely, out of the most beautiful eyes I\r\never saw.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not afraid to see him,\" she said proudly, \"and he ought not to be\r\nafraid to see me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to tell you something before you see him. Last night, before he\r\ncame, I thought that--well, that at least he knew something of--the\r\nthings we want to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"In justice to him, and because I want to fight fair, I tell you\r\nto-night that I don't believe he knows anything about your father's\r\ndeath, and that I believe he was robbed that night at Bellwood.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about the pearls he sold at Plattsburg?\" she asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"I think when the proper time comes, he will tell about that too,\r\nMargery.\" I did not notice my use of her name until too late. If she\r\nheard, she failed to resent it. \"After all, if you love him, hardly\r\nanything else matters, does it? How do we know but that he was in\r\ntrouble, and that Aunt Jane herself gave them to him?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at me with a little perplexity.\r\n\r\n\"You plead his cause very well,\" she said. \"Did he ask you to speak to\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't run a race with a man who is lame,\" I said quietly. \"Ethically,\r\nI ought to go away and leave you to your dreams, but I am not going to\r\ndo it. If you love Wardrop as a woman ought to love the man she marries,\r\nthen marry him and I hope you will be happy. If you don't--no, let me\r\nfinish. I have made up my mind to clear him if I can: to bring him to\r\nyou with a clear slate. Then, I know it is audacious, but I am going to\r\ncome, too, and--I'm going to plead for myself then, unless you send me\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat with her head bent, her color coming and going nervously. Now\r\nshe looked up at me with what was the ghost of a smile.\r\n\r\n\"It sounds like a threat,\" she said in a low voice. \"And you--I wonder\r\nif you always get what you want?\"\r\n\r\nThen, of course, Fred came in, and fell over a hassock looking for\r\nmatches. Edith opened the door of the den and called him to her\r\nirritably, but Fred declined to leave the wood fire, and settled down\r\nin his easy chair. After a while Edith came over and joined us, but she\r\nsnubbed Fred the entire evening, to his bewilderment. And when\r\nconversation lagged, during the evening that followed, I tried to\r\nremember what I had said, and knew I had done very badly. Only one thing\r\ncheered me: she had not been angry, and she had understood. Blessed be\r\nthe woman that understands!\r\n\r\nWe broke up for the night about eleven. Mrs. Butler had come down for a\r\nwhile, and had even played a little, something of Tschaikovsky's, a\r\nsinging, plaintive theme that brought sadness back into Margery's face,\r\nand made me think, for no reason, of a wet country road and a plodding,\r\nback-burdened peasant.\r\n\r\nFred and I sat in the library for a while after the rest had gone, and I\r\ntold him a little of what I had learned that afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"A second wife!\" he said, \"and a primitive type, eh? Well, did she shoot\r\nhim, or did Schwartz? The Lady or the Democratic Tiger?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Tiger,\" I said firmly.\r\n\r\n\"The Lady,\" Fred, with equal assurance.\r\n\r\nFred closed the house with his usual care. It required the combined\r\nefforts of the maids followed up by Fred, to lock the windows, it being\r\nhis confident assertion that in seven years of keeping house, he had\r\nnever failed to find at least one unlocked window.\r\n\r\nOn that night, I remember, he went around with his usual scrupulous\r\ncare. Then we went up to bed, leaving a small light at the telephone in\r\nthe lower hall: nothing else.\r\n\r\nThe house was a double one, built around a square hall below, which\r\nserved the purpose of a general sitting-room. From the front door a\r\nshort, narrow hall led back to this, with a room on either side, and\r\nfrom it doors led into the rest of the lower floor. At one side the\r\nstairs took the ascent easily, with two stops for landings, and\r\nup-stairs the bedrooms opened from a similar, slightly smaller square\r\nhall. The staircase to the third floor went up from somewhere back in\r\nthe nursery wing.\r\n\r\nMy bedroom was over the library, and Mrs. Butler and Margery Fleming had\r\nconnecting rooms, across the hall. Fred and Edith slept in the nursery\r\nwing, so they would be near the children. In the square upper hall there\r\nwas a big reading table, a lamp, and some comfortable chairs. Here, when\r\nthey were alone, Fred read aloud the evening paper, or his latest short\r\nstory, and Edith's sewing basket showed how she put in what women\r\nmiscall their leisure.\r\n\r\nI did not go to sleep at once: naturally the rather vital step I had\r\ntaken in the library insisted on being considered and almost regretted.\r\nI tried reading myself to sleep, and when that failed, I tried the\r\nsoothing combination of a cigarette and a book. That worked like a\r\ncharm; the last thing I remember is of holding the cigarette in a death\r\ngrip as I lay with my pillows propped back of me, my head to the light,\r\nand a delightful languor creeping over me.\r\n\r\nI was wakened by the pungent acrid smell of smoke, and I sat up and\r\nblinked my eyes open. The side of the bed was sending up a steady column\r\nof gray smoke, and there was a smart crackle of fire under me somewhere.\r\nI jumped out of bed and saw the trouble instantly. My cigarette had\r\ndropped from my hand, still lighted, and as is the way with cigarettes,\r\ndetermined to burn to the end. In so doing it had fired my bed, the rug\r\nunder the bed and pretty nearly the man on the bed.\r\n\r\nIt took some sharp work to get it all out without rousing the house.\r\nThen I stood amid the wreckage and looked ruefully at Edith's pretty\r\nroom. I could see, mentally, the spot of water on the library ceiling\r\nthe next morning, and I could hear Fred's strictures on the heedlessness\r\nand indifference to property of bachelors in general and me in\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\nThree pitchers of water on the bed had made it an impossible couch. I\r\nput on a dressing-gown, and, with a blanket over my arm, I went out to\r\nhunt some sort of place to sleep. I decided on the davenport in the hall\r\njust outside, and as quietly as I could, I put a screen around it and\r\nsettled down for the night.\r\n\r\nI was wakened by the touch of a hand on my face. I started, I think, and\r\nthe hand was jerked away--I am not sure: I was still drowsy. I lay very\r\nquiet, listening for footsteps, but none came. With the feeling that\r\nthere was some one behind the screen, I jumped up. The hall was dark\r\nand quiet. When I found no one I concluded it had been only a vivid\r\ndream, and I sat down on the edge of the davenport and yawned.\r\n\r\nI heard Edith moving back in the nursery: she has an uncomfortable habit\r\nof wandering around in the night, covering the children, closing\r\nwindows, and sniffing for fire. I was afraid some of the smoke from my\r\nconflagration had reached her suspicious nose, but she did not come into\r\nthe front hall. I was wide-awake by that time, and it was then, I think,\r\nthat I noticed a heavy, sweetish odor in the air. At first I thought one\r\nof the children might be ill, and that Edith was dosing him with one of\r\nthe choice concoctions that she kept in the bath-room medicine closet.\r\nWhen she closed her door, however, and went back to bed, I knew I had\r\nbeen mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe sweetish smell was almost nauseating. For some reason or\r\nother--association of certain odors with certain events--I found myself\r\nrecalling the time I had a wisdom tooth taken out, and that when I came\r\naround I was being sat on by the dentist and his assistant, and the\r\nlatter had a black eye. Then, suddenly, I knew. The sickly odor was\r\nchloroform!\r\n\r\nI had the light on in a moment, and was rapping at Margery's door. It\r\nwas locked, and I got no answer. A pale light shone over the transom,\r\nbut everything was ominously quiet, beyond the door. I went to Mrs.\r\nButler's door, next; it was unlocked and partly open. One glance at the\r\nempty bed and the confusion of the place, and I rushed without ceremony\r\nthrough the connecting door into Margery's room.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere was reeking with chloroform. The girl was in bed,\r\napparently sleeping quietly. One arm was thrown up over her head, and\r\nthe other lay relaxed on the white cover. A folded towel had been laid\r\nacross her face, and when I jerked it away I saw she was breathing very\r\nslowly, stertorously, with her eyes partly open and fixed.\r\n\r\nI threw up all the windows, before I roused the family, and as soon as\r\nEdith was in the room I telephoned for the doctor. I hardly remember\r\nwhat I did until he came: I know we tried to rouse Margery and failed,\r\nand I know that Fred went down-stairs and said the silver was intact and\r\nthe back kitchen door open. And then the doctor came, and I was put out\r\nin the hall, and for an eternity, I walked up and down, eight steps one\r\nway, eight steps back, unable to think, unable even to hope.\r\n\r\nNot until the doctor came out to me, and said she was better, and would\r\nI call a maid to make some strong black coffee, did I come out of my\r\nstupor. The chance of doing something, anything, made me determine to\r\nmake the coffee myself. They still speak of that coffee at Fred's.\r\n\r\nIt was Edith who brought Mrs. Butler to my mind. Fred had maintained\r\nthat she had fled before the intruders, and was probably in some closet\r\nor corner of the upper floor. I am afraid our solicitude was long in\r\ncoming. It was almost an hour before we organized a searching party to\r\nlook for her. Fred went up-stairs, and I took the lower floor.\r\n\r\nIt was I who found her, after all, lying full length on the grass in the\r\nlittle square yard back of the house. She was in a dead faint, and she\r\nwas a much more difficult patient than Margery.\r\n\r\nWe could get no story from either of them that night. The two rooms had\r\nbeen ransacked, but apparently nothing had been stolen. Fred vowed he\r\nhad locked and bolted the kitchen door, and that it had been opened from\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange experience, that night intrusion into the house,\r\nwithout robbery as a motive. If Margery knew or suspected the reason for\r\nthe outrage, she refused to say. As for Mrs. Butler, to mention the\r\noccurrence put her into hysteria. It was Fred who put forth the most\r\nstartling theory of the lot.\r\n\r\n\"By George,\" he said the next morning when we had failed to find tracks\r\nin the yard, and Edith had reported every silver spoon in its place, \"by\r\nGeorge, it wouldn't surprise me if the lady in the grave clothes did it\r\nherself. There isn't anything a hysterical woman won't do to rouse your\r\ninterest in her, if it begins to flag. How did any one get in through\r\nthat kitchen door, when it was locked inside and bolted? I tell you, she\r\nopened it herself.\"\r\n\r\nI did not like to force Margery's confidence, but I believed that the\r\noutrage was directly for the purpose of searching her room, perhaps for\r\npapers that had been her father's. Mrs. Butler came around enough by\r\nmorning, to tell a semi-connected story in which she claimed that two\r\nmen had come in from a veranda roof, and tried to chloroform her. That\r\nshe had pretended to be asleep and had taken the first opportunity,\r\nwhile they were in the other room, to run down-stairs and into the yard.\r\nEdith thought it likely enough, being a credulous person.\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, Edith's intuition was more reliable than my\r\nskepticism,--or Fred's.\r\n\nThe inability of Margery Fleming to tell who had chloroformed her, and\r\nMrs. Butler's white face and brooding eyes made a very respectable\r\nmystery out of the affair. Only Fred, Edith and I came down to breakfast\r\nthat morning. Fred's expression was half amused, half puzzled. Edith\r\nfluttered uneasily over the coffee machine, her cheeks as red as the bow\r\nof ribbon at her throat. I was preoccupied, and, like Fred, I propped\r\nthe morning paper in front of me and proceeded to think in its shelter.\r\n\r\n\"Did you find anything, Fred?\" Edith asked. Fred did not reply, so she\r\nrepeated the question with some emphasis.\r\n\r\n\"Eh--what?\" Fred inquired, peering around the corner of the paper.\r\n\r\n\"Did--you--find--any--clue?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear--that is, no. Nothing to amount to anything. Upon my soul,\r\nJack, if I wrote the editorials of this paper, I'd _say_ something.\" He\r\nsubsided into inarticulate growls behind the paper, and everything was\r\nquiet. Then I heard a sniffle, distinctly. I looked up. Edith was\r\ncrying--pouring cream into a coffee cup, and feeling blindly for the\r\nsugar, with her pretty face twisted and her pretty eyes obscured. In a\r\nsecond I was up, had crumpled the newspapers, including Fred's, into a\r\nball, and had lifted him bodily out of his chair.\r\n\r\n\"When I am married,\" I said fiercely, jerking him around to Edith and\r\npushing him into a chair beside her, \"if I ever read the paper at\r\nbreakfast when my wife is bursting for conversation, may I have some\r\ngood and faithful friend who will bring me back to a sense of my duty.\"\r\nI drew a chair to Edith's other side. \"Now, let's talk,\" I said.\r\n\r\nShe wiped her eyes shamelessly with her table napkin. \"There isn't a\r\nsoul in this house I can talk to,\" she wailed. \"All kinds of awful\r\nthings happening--and we had to send for coffee this morning, Jack. You\r\nmust have used four pounds last night--and nobody will tell me a thing.\r\nThere's no use asking Margery--she's sick at her stomach from the\r\nchloroform--and Ellen never talks except about herself, and she's\r\nhorribly--uninteresting. And Fred and you make a ba--barricade out of\r\nnewspapers, and fire 'yes' at me when you mean 'no.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I put the coffee back where I got it, Edith,\" I protested stoutly. \"I\r\nknow we're barbarians, but I'll swear to that.\" And then I stopped, for\r\nI had a sudden recollection of going up-stairs with something fat and\r\ntinny in my arms, of finding it in my way, and of hastily thrusting it\r\ninto the boys' boot closet under the nursery stair.\r\n\r\nFred had said nothing. He had taken her hand and was patting it gently,\r\nthe while his eye sought the head-lines on the wad of morning paper.\r\n\r\n\"You burned that blue rug,\" she said to me disconsolately, with a threat\r\nof fresh tears. \"It took me ages to find the right shade of blue.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will buy you that Shirvan you wanted,\" I hastened to assure her.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, to take away when you get married.\" There is a hint of the shrew\r\nin all good women.\r\n\r\n\"I will buy the Shirvan and _not_ get married.\"\r\n\r\nHere, I regret to say, Edith suddenly laughed. She threw her head back\r\nand jeered at me.\r\n\r\n\"You!\" she chortled, and pointed one slim finger at me mockingly. \"You,\r\nwho are so mad about one girl that you love all women for her sake! You,\r\nwho go white instead of red when she comes into the room! You, who have\r\nlet your practice go to the dogs to be near her, and then never speak to\r\nher when she's around, but sit with your mouth open like a puppy begging\r\nfor candy, ready to snap up every word she throws you and wiggle with\r\njoy!\"\r\n\r\nI was terrified.\r\n\r\n\"Honestly, Edith, do I do that?\" I gasped. But she did not answer; she\r\nonly leaned over and kissed Fred.\r\n\r\n\"Women like men to be awful fools about them,\" she said. \"That's why I'm\r\nso crazy about Freddie.\" He writhed.\r\n\r\n\"If I tell you something nice, Jack, will you make it a room-size rug?\"\r\n\r\n\"Room size it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then--Margery's engagement ring was stolen last night and when I\r\ncommiserated her she said--dear me, the lamp's out and the coffee is\r\ncold!\"\r\n\r\n\"Remarkable speech, under the circumstances,\" said Fred.\r\n\r\nEdith rang the bell and seemed to be thinking. \"Perhaps we'd better make\r\nit four small rugs instead of one large one,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Not a rug until you have told me what Margery said,\" firmly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that! Why, she said it really didn't matter about the ring. She had\r\nnever cared much about it anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that's only a matter of taste,\" I protested, somewhat disappointed.\r\nBut Edith got up and patted me on the top of my head.\r\n\r\n\"Silly,\" she said. \"If the right man came along and gave her a rubber\r\nteething ring, she'd be crazy about it for his sake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Edith!\" Fred said, shocked. But Edith had gone.\r\n\r\nShe took me up-stairs before I left for the office to measure for the\r\nShirvan, Edith being a person who believes in obtaining a thing while\r\nthe desire for it is in its first bloom. Across the hall Fred was\r\ntalking to Margery through the transom.\r\n\r\n\"Mustard leaves are mighty helpful,\" he was saying. \"I always take 'em\r\non shipboard. And cheer up: land's in sight.\"\r\n\r\nI would have given much for Fred's ease of manner when, a few minutes\r\nlater, Edith having decided on four Shirvans and a hall runner, she took\r\nme to the door of Margery's room.\r\n\r\nShe was lying very still and pale in the center of the white bed, and\r\nshe tried bravely to smile at us.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you are better,\" I said. \"Don't let Edith convince you that my\r\ncoffee has poisoned you.\"\r\n\r\nShe said she was a little better, and that she didn't know she had had\r\nany coffee. That was the extent of the conversation. I, who have a local\r\nreputation of a sort before a jury, I could not think of another word to\r\nsay. I stood there for a minute uneasily, with Edith poking me with her\r\nfinger to go inside the door and speak and act like an intelligent human\r\nbeing. But I only muttered something about a busy day before me and\r\nfled. It was a singular thing, but as I stood in the doorway, I had a\r\nvivid mental picture of Edith's description of me, sitting up puppy-like\r\nto beg for a kind word, and wiggling with delight when I got it. If I\r\nslunk into my office that morning like a dog scourged to his kennel,\r\nEdith was responsible.\r\n\r\nAt the office I found a note from Miss Letitia, and after a glance at it\r\nI looked for the first train, in my railroad schedule. The note was\r\nbrief; unlike the similar epistle I had received from Miss Jane the day\r\nshe disappeared, this one was very formal.\r\n\r\n     \"MR. JOHN KNOX:\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR SIR--Kindly oblige me by coming to see me as soon as you\r\n     get this. Some things have happened, not that I think they are\r\n     worth a row of pins, but Hepsibah is an old fool, and she says\r\n     she did not put the note in the milk bottle.\r\n\r\n    \"Yours very respectfully,\r\n\r\n    \"LETITIA ANN MAITLAND.\"\r\n\r\nI had an appointment with Burton for the afternoon, to take Wardrop, if\r\nwe could get him on some pretext, to Doctor Anderson. That day, also, I\r\nhad two cases on the trial list. I got Humphreys, across the hall, to\r\ntake them over, and evading Hawes' resentful blink, I went on my way to\r\nBellwood. It was nine days since Miss Jane had disappeared. On my way\r\nout in the train I jotted down the things that had happened in that\r\ntime: Allan Fleming had died and been buried; the Borough Bank had\r\nfailed; some one had got into the Fleming house and gone through the\r\npapers there; Clarkson had killed himself; we had found that Wardrop had\r\nsold the pearls; the leather bag had been returned; Fleming's second\r\nwife had appeared, and some one had broken into my own house and,\r\nintentionally or not, had almost sent Margery Fleming over the\r\nborderland.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me everything pointed in one direction, to a malignity\r\nagainst Fleming that extended itself to the daughter. I thought of what\r\nthe woman who claimed to be the dead man's second wife had said the day\r\nbefore. If the staircase she had spoken of opened into the room where\r\nFleming was shot, and if Schwartz was in town at the time, then, in view\r\nof her story that he had already tried once to kill him, the likelihood\r\nwas that Schwartz was at least implicated.\r\n\r\nIf Wardrop knew that, why had he not denounced him? Was I to believe\r\nthat, after all the mystery, the number eleven twenty-two was to resolve\r\nitself into the number of a house? Would it be typical of the Schwartz I\r\nknew to pin bits of paper to a man's pillow? On the other hand, if he\r\nhad reason to think that Fleming had papers that would incriminate him,\r\nit would be like Schwartz to hire some one to search for them, and he\r\nwould be equal to having Wardrop robbed of the money he was taking to\r\nFleming.\r\n\r\nGranting that Schwartz had killed Fleming--then who was the woman with\r\nWardrop the night he was robbed? Why did he take the pearls and sell\r\nthem? How did the number eleven twenty-two come into Aunt Jane's\r\npossession? How did the leather bag get to Boston? Who had chloroformed\r\nMargery? Who had been using the Fleming house while it was closed? Most\r\nimportant of all now--where was Aunt Jane?\r\n\r\nThe house at Bellwood looked almost cheerful in the May sunshine, as I\r\nwent up the walk. Nothing ever changed the straight folds of the\r\nold-fashioned lace curtains; no dog ever tracked the porch, or buried\r\nsacrilegious and odorous bones on the level lawn; the birds were nesting\r\nin the trees, well above the reach of Robert's ladder, but they were\r\ndecorous, well-behaved birds, whose prim courting never partook of the\r\nexuberance of their neighbors', bursting their little throats in an elm\r\nabove the baby perambulator in the next yard.\r\n\r\nWhen Bella had let me in, and I stood once more in the straight hall,\r\nwith the green rep chairs and the Japanese umbrella stand, involuntarily\r\nI listened for the tap of Miss Jane's small feet on the stairs. Instead\r\ncame Bella's heavy tread, and a request from Miss Letitia that I go\r\nup-stairs.\r\n\r\nThe old lady was sitting by a window of her bedroom, in a chintz\r\nupholstered chair. She did not appear to be feeble; the only change I\r\nnoticed was a relaxation in the severe tidiness of her dress. I guessed\r\nthat Miss Jane's exquisite neatness had been responsible for the white\r\nruchings, the soft caps, and the spotless shoulder shawls which had\r\nmade lovely their latter years.\r\n\r\n\"You've taken your own time about coming, haven't you?\" Miss Letitia\r\nasked sourly. \"If it hadn't been for that cousin of yours you sent here,\r\nBurton, I'd have been driven to sending for Amelia Miles, and when I\r\nsend for Amelia Miles for company, I'm in a bad way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have had a great deal to attend to,\" I said as loud as I could. \"I\r\ncame some days ago to tell you Mr. Fleming was dead; after that we had\r\nto bury him, and close the house. It's been a very sad--\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he leave anything?\" she interrupted. \"It isn't sad at all unless he\r\ndidn't leave anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"He left very little. The house, perhaps, and I regret to have to tell\r\nyou that a woman came to me yesterday who claims to be a second wife.\"\r\n\r\nShe took off her glasses, wiped them and put them on again.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" she said with a snap, \"there's one other woman in the world as\r\nbig a fool as my sister Martha was. I didn't know there were two of 'em.\r\nWhat do you hear about Jane?\"\r\n\r\n\"The last time I was here,\" I shouted, \"you thought she was dead; have\r\nyou changed your mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"The last time you were here,\" she said with dignity, \"I thought a good\r\nmany things that were wrong. I thought I had lost some of the pearls,\r\nbut I hadn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" I exclaimed incredulously. She put her hands on the arms of her\r\nchair, and leaning forward, shot the words at me viciously.\r\n\r\n\"I--said--I--had--lost--some--of--the--pearls--well--I--haven't.\"\r\n\r\nShe didn't expect me to believe her, any more than she believed it\r\nherself. But why on earth she had changed her attitude about the pearls\r\nwas beyond me. I merely nodded comprehensively.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" I said, \"I'm glad to know it was a mistake. Now, the next\r\nthing is to find Miss Jane.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have found her,\" she said tartly. \"That's what I sent for you\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\n\"Found her!\" This time I did get out of my chair. \"What on earth do you\r\nmean, Miss Letitia? Why, we've been scouring the country for her.\"\r\n\r\nShe opened a religious monthly on the table beside her, and took out a\r\nfolded paper. I had to control my impatience while she changed her\r\nglasses and read it slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Heppie found it on the back porch, under a milk bottle,\" she prefaced.\r\nThen she read it to me. I do not remember the wording, and Miss Letitia\r\nrefused, both then and later, to let it out of her hands. As a result,\r\nunlike the other manuscripts in the case, I have not even a copy. The\r\nsubstance, shorn of its bad spelling and grammar, was this:\r\n\r\nThe writer knew where Miss Jane was; the inference being that he was\r\nresponsible. She was well and happy, but she had happened to read a\r\nnewspaper with an account of her disappearance, and it had worried her.\r\nThe payment of the small sum of five thousand dollars would send her\r\nback as well as the day she left. The amount, left in a tin can on the\r\nbase of the Maitland shaft in the cemetery, would bring the missing lady\r\nback within twenty-four hours. On the contrary, if the recipient of the\r\nletter notified the police, it would go hard with Miss Jane.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of it?\" she asked, looking at me over her glasses.\r\n\"If she was fool enough to be carried away by a man that spells cemetery\r\nwith one m, she deserves what she's got. And I won't pay five thousand,\r\nanyhow, it's entirely too much.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't sound quite genuine to me,\" I said, reading it over. \"I\r\nshould certainly not leave any money until we had tried to find who left\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not so sure but what she'd better stay a while anyhow,\" Miss\r\nLetitia pursued. \"Now that we know she's living, I ain't so particular\r\nwhen she gets back. She's been notionate lately anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nI had been reading the note again. \"There's one thing here that makes me\r\ndoubt the whole story,\" I said. \"What's this about her reading the\r\npapers? I thought her reading glasses were found in the library.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Letitia snatched the paper from me and read it again.\r\n\r\n\"Reading the paper!\" she sniffed. \"You've got more sense than I've been\r\ngiving you credit for, Knox. Her glasses are here this minute; without\r\nthem she can't see to scratch her nose.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a disappointment to me, although the explanation was simple\r\nenough. It was surprising that we had not had more attempts to play on\r\nour fears. But the really important thing bearing on Miss Jane's\r\ndeparture was when Heppie came into the room, with her apron turned up\r\nlike a pocket and her dust cap pushed down over her eyes like the slouch\r\nhat of a bowery tough.\r\n\r\nWhen she got to the middle of the room she stopped and abruptly dropped\r\nthe corners of her apron. There rolled out a heterogeneous collection of\r\nthings: a white muslin garment which proved to be a nightgown, with long\r\nsleeves and high collar; a half-dozen hair curlers--I knew those; Edith\r\nhad been seen, in midnight emergencies, with her hair twisted around\r\njust such instruments of torture--a shoe buttoner; a railroad map, and\r\none new and unworn black kid glove.\r\n\r\nMiss Letitia changed her glasses deliberately, and took a comprehensive\r\nsurvey of the things on the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get 'em?\" she said, fixing Heppie with an awful eye.\r\n\r\n\"I found 'em stuffed under the blankets in the chest of drawers in the\r\nattic,\" Heppie shouted at her. \"If we'd washed blankets last week, as I\r\nwanted to--\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up!\" Miss Letitia said shortly, and Heppie's thin lips closed with\r\na snap. \"Now then, Knox, what do you make of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"If that's the nightgown she was wearing the night she disappeared, I\r\nthink it shows one thing very clearly, Miss Maitland. She was not\r\nabducted, and she knew perfectly well what she was about. None of her\r\nclothes was missing, and that threw us off the track; but look at this\r\nnew glove! She may have had new things to put on and left the old. The\r\nmap--well, she was going somewhere, with a definite purpose. When we\r\nfind out what took her away, we will find her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\"\r\n\r\n\"She didn't go unexpectedly--that is, she was prepared for whatever it\r\nwas.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe a word of it,\" the old lady burst out. \"She didn't have\r\na secret; she was the kind that couldn't keep a secret. She wasn't\r\nresponsible, I tell you; she was extravagant. Look at that glove! And\r\nshe had three pairs half worn in her bureau.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Maitland,\" I asked suddenly, \"did you ever hear of eleven\r\ntwenty-two?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eleven twenty-two what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just the number, eleven twenty-two,\" I repeated. \"Does it mean anything\r\nto you? Has it any significance?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say it has,\" she retorted. \"In the last ten years the Colored\r\nOrphans' Home has cared for, fed, clothed, and pampered exactly eleven\r\nhundred and twenty-two colored children, of every condition of shape and\r\nmisshape, brains and no brains.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has no other connection?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eleven twenty-two? Twice eleven is twenty-two, if that's any help. No,\r\nI can't think of anything. I loaned Allan Fleming a thousand dollars\r\nonce; I guess my mind was failing. It would be about eleven twenty-two\r\nby this time.\"\r\n\r\nNeither of which explanations sufficed for the little scrap found in\r\nMiss Jane's room. What connection, if any, had it with her flight? Where\r\nwas she now. What was eleven twenty-two? And why did Miss Letitia deny\r\nthat she had lost the pearls, when I already knew that nine of the ten\r\nhad been sold, who had bought them, and approximately how much he had\r\npaid?\r\n\nI ate a light lunch at Bellwood, alone, with Bella to look after me in\r\nthe dining-room. She was very solicitous, and when she had brought my\r\ntea, I thought she wanted to say something. She stood awkwardly near the\r\ndoor, and watched me.\r\n\r\n\"You needn't wait, Bella,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, sir, but--I wanted to ask you--is Miss Fleming\r\nwell?\"\r\n\r\n\"She was not very well this morning, but I don't think it is serious,\r\nBella,\" I replied. She turned to go, but I fancied she hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Bella,\" I called, as she was going out, \"I want to ask you\r\nsomething. The night at the Fleming home, when you and I watched the\r\nhouse, didn't you hear some person running along the hall outside your\r\ndoor? About two o'clock, I think?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at me stolidly.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I slept all night.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's strange. And you didn't hear me when I fell down the dumb-waiter\r\nshaft?\"\r\n\r\n\"Holy saints!\" she ejaculated. \"Was _that_ where you fell!\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped herself abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"You heard that?\" I asked gently, \"and yet you slept all night? Bella,\r\nthere's a hitch somewhere. You didn't sleep that night, at all; you told\r\nMiss Fleming I had been up all night. How did you know that? If I didn't\r\nknow that you couldn't possibly get around as fast as the--person in the\r\nhouse that night, I would say you had been in Mr. Fleming's desk,\r\nlooking for--let us say, postage stamps. May I have another cup of\r\ncoffee?\"\r\n\r\nShe turned a sickly yellow white, and gathered up my cup and saucer with\r\ntrembling hands. When the coffee finally came back it was brought\r\ngrumblingly by old Heppie. \"She says she's turned her ankle,\" she\r\nsniffed. \"Turned it on a lathe, like a table leg, I should say, from the\r\nshape of it.\" Before I left the dining-room I put another line in my\r\nnote-book:\r\n\r\n\"What does Bella know?\"\r\n\r\nI got back to the city somewhat late for my appointment with Burton. I\r\nfound Wardrop waiting for me at the office, and if I had been astonished\r\nat the change in him two nights before, I was shocked now. He seemed to\r\nhave shrunk in his clothes; his eyeballs were bloodshot from drinking,\r\nand his fair hair had dropped, neglected, over his forehead. He was\r\nsitting in his familiar attitude, his elbows on his knees, his chin on\r\nhis palms.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with dull eyes, when I went in. I did not see Burton at\r\nfirst. He was sitting on my desk, holding a flat can in his hand, and\r\ndigging out with a wooden toothpick one sardine after another and\r\nbolting them whole.\r\n\r\n\"Your good health,\" he said, poising one in the air, where it threatened\r\noily tears over the carpet. \"As an appetite-quencher and\r\nthirst-producer, give me the festive sardine. How lovely it would be if\r\nwe could eat 'em without smelling 'em!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you do anything but eat?\" Wardrop asked, without enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nBurton eyed him reproachfully. \"Is that what I get for doing without\r\nlunch, in order to prove to you that you are not crazy?\" He appealed to\r\nme. \"He says he's crazy--lost his think works. Now, I ask you, Knox,\r\nwhen I go to the trouble to find out for him that he's got as many\r\nconvolutions as anybody, and that they've only got a little convolved,\r\nis it fair, I ask you, for him to reproach me about my food?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know you knew each other,\" I put in, while Burton took another\r\nsardine.\r\n\r\n\"He says we do,\" Wardrop said wearily; \"says he used to knock me around\r\nat college.\"\r\n\r\nBurton winked at me solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"He doesn't remember me, but he will,\" he said. \"It's his nerves that\r\nare gone, and we'll have him restrung with new wires, like an old piano,\r\nin a week.\"\r\n\r\nWardrop had that after-debauch suspicion of all men, but I think he\r\ngrasped at me as a dependability.\r\n\r\n\"He wants me to go to a doctor,\" he said. \"I'm not sick; it's only--\" He\r\nwas trying to light a cigarette, but the match dropped from his shaking\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n\"Better see one, Wardrop,\" I urged--and I felt mean enough about doing\r\nit. \"You need something to brace you up.\"\r\n\r\nBurton gave him a very small drink, for he could scarcely stand, and we\r\nwent down in the elevator. My contempt for the victim between us was as\r\ngreat as my contempt for myself. That Wardrop was in a bad position\r\nthere could be no doubt; there might be more men than Fleming who had\r\nknown about the money in the leather bag, and who thought he had taken\r\nit and probably killed Fleming to hide the theft.\r\n\r\nIt seemed incredible that an innocent man would collapse as he had done,\r\nand yet--at this minute I can name a dozen men who, under the club of\r\npublic disapproval, have fallen into paresis, insanity and the grave. We\r\nare all indifferent to our fellow-men until they are against us.\r\n\r\nBurton knew the specialist very well--in fact, there seemed to be few\r\npeople he did not know. And considering the way he had got hold of Miss\r\nLetitia and Wardrop, it was not surprising. He had evidently arranged\r\nwith the doctor, for the waiting-room was empty and we were after\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was a large man, his size emphasized by the clothes he wore,\r\nvery light in color, and unprofessional in cut. He was sandy-haired,\r\ninclined to be bald, and with shrewd, light blue eyes behind his\r\nglasses. Not particularly impressive, except as to size, on first\r\nacquaintance; a good fellow, with a brisk voice, and an amazingly light\r\ntread.\r\n\r\nHe began by sending Wardrop into a sort of examining room in the rear of\r\nthe suite somewhere, to take off his coat and collar. When he had gone\r\nthe doctor looked at a slip of paper in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"I think I've got it all from Mr. Burton,\" he said. \"Of course, Mr.\r\nKnox, this is a little out of my line; a nerve specialist has as much\r\nbusiness with psychotherapy as a piano tuner has with musical technique.\r\nBut the idea is Munsterburg's, and I've had some good results. I'll give\r\nhim a short physical examination, and when I ring the bell one of you\r\nmay come in. Are you a newspaper man, Mr. Knox?\"\r\n\r\n\"An attorney,\" I said briefly.\r\n\r\n\"Press man, lawyer, or doctor,\" Burton broke in, \"we all fatten on the\r\nother fellow's troubles, don't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't fatten very much,\" I corrected \"We live.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor blinked behind his glasses.\r\n\r\n\"I never saw a lawyer yet who would admit he was making money,\" he said.\r\n\"Look at the way a doctor grinds for a pittance! He's just as capable as\r\nthe lawyer; he works a damn sight harder, and he makes a tenth the\r\nincome. A man will pay his lawyer ten thousand dollars for keeping him\r\nout of jail for six months, and he'll kick like a steer if his doctor\r\ncharges him a hundred to keep him out of hell for life! Which of you\r\nwill come in? I'm afraid two would distract him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess it is Knox's butt-in,\" Burton conceded, \"but I get it later,\r\nDoctor; you promised.\"\r\n\r\nThe physical examination was very brief; when I was called in Wardrop\r\nwas standing at the window looking down into the street below, and the\r\ndoctor was writing at his desk. Behind Wardrop's back he gave me the\r\nslip he had written.\r\n\r\n     \"Test is for association of ideas. Watch length of time between\r\n     word I give and his reply. I often get hold of facts forgotten\r\n     by the patient. A wait before the answering word is given shows\r\n     an attempt at concealment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Wardrop,\" he said, \"will you sit here, please?\"\r\n\r\nHe drew a chair to the center-table for Wardrop, and another, just\r\nacross for himself. I sat back and to one side of the patient, where I\r\ncould see Wardrop's haggard profile and every movement of the\r\nspecialist.\r\n\r\nOn the table was an electric instrument like a small clock, and the\r\ndoctor's first action was to attach to it two wires with small, black\r\nrubber mouthpieces.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Wardrop,\" he said, \"we will go on with the test. Your other\r\ncondition is fair, as I told you; I think you can dismiss the idea of\r\ninsanity without a second thought, but there is something more than\r\nbrain and body to be considered; in other words, you have been through a\r\nstorm, and some of your nervous wires are down. Put the mouthpiece\r\nbetween your lips, please; you see, I do the same with mine. And when I\r\ngive you a word, speak as quickly as possible the association it brings\r\nto your mind. For instance, I say 'noise.' Your first association might\r\nbe 'street,' 'band,' 'drum,' almost anything associated with the word.\r\nAs quickly as possible, please.\"\r\n\r\nThe first few words went simply enough. Wardrop's replies came almost\r\ninstantly. To \"light\" he replied \"lamp;\" \"touch\" brought the response\r\n\"hand;\" \"eat\" brought \"Burton,\" and both the doctor and I smiled.\r\nWardrop was intensely serious. Then--\r\n\r\n\"Taxicab,\" said the doctor, and, after an almost imperceptible pause,\r\n\"road\" came the association. All at once I began to see the\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\n\"Desk.\" \"Pen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pipe.\" \"Smoke.\"\r\n\r\n\"Head.\" After a perceptible pause the answer came uncertainly. \"Hair.\"\r\nBut the association of ideas would not be denied, for in answer to the\r\nnext word, which was \"ice,\" he gave \"blood,\" evidently following up the\r\nprevious word \"head.\"\r\n\r\nI found myself gripping the arms of my chair. The dial on the doctor's\r\nclock-like instrument was measuring the interval; I could see that now.\r\nThe doctor took a record of every word and its response. Wardrop's eyes\r\nwere shifting nervously.\r\n\r\n\"Hot.\" \"Cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"White.\" \"Black.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whisky.\" \"Glass,\" all in less than a second.\r\n\r\n\"Pearls.\" A little hesitation, then \"box.\"\r\n\r\n\"Taxicab\" again. \"Night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Silly.\" \"Wise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shot.\" After a pause, \"revolver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Night.\" \"Dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blood.\" \"Head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Water.\" \"Drink.\"\r\n\r\n\"Traveling-bag.\" He brought out the word \"train\" after an evident\r\nstruggle, but in answer to the next word \"lost,\" instead of the obvious\r\n\"found,\" he said \"woman.\" He had not had sufficient mental agility to\r\nget away from the association with \"bag.\" The \"woman\" belonged there.\r\n\r\n\"Murder\" brought \"dead,\" but \"shot,\" following immediately after,\r\nbrought \"staircase.\"\r\n\r\nI think Wardrop was on his guard by that time, but the conscious effort\r\nto hide truths that might be damaging made the intervals longer, from\r\nthat time on. Already I felt sure that Allan Fleming's widow had been\r\nright; he had been shot from the locked back staircase. But by whom?\r\n\r\n\"Blow\" brought \"chair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone.\" \"Bag\" came like a flash.\r\n\r\nIn quick succession, without pause, came the words--\r\n\r\n\"Bank.\" \"Note.\"\r\n\r\n\"Door.\" \"Bolt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Money.\" \"Letters,\" without any apparent connection.\r\n\r\nWardrop was going to the bad. When, to the next word, \"staircase,\"\r\nagain, he said \"scar,\" his demoralization was almost complete. As for\r\nme, the scene in Wardrop's mind was already in mine--Schwartz, with the\r\nscar across his ugly forehead, and the bolted door to the staircase\r\nopen!\r\n\r\nOn again with the test.\r\n\r\n\"Flour,\" after perhaps two seconds, from the preceding shock, brought\r\n\"bread.\"\r\n\r\n\"Trees.\" \"Leaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Night.\" \"Dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gate.\" He stopped here so long, I thought he was not going to answer at\r\nall. Presently, with am effort, he said \"wood,\" but as before, the\r\nassociation idea came out in the next word; for \"electric light\" he gave\r\n\"letters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Attic\" brought \"trunks\" at once.\r\n\r\n\"Closet.\" After perhaps a second and a half came \"dust,\" showing what\r\ncloset was in his mind, and immediately after, to \"match\" he gave \"pen.\"\r\n\r\nA long list of words followed which told nothing, to my mind, although\r\nthe doctor's eyes were snapping with excitement. Then \"traveling-bag\"\r\nagain, and instead of his previous association, \"woman,\" this time he\r\ngave \"yellow.\" But, to the next word, \"house,\" he gave \"guest.\" It came\r\nto me that in his mental processes I was the guest, the substitute bag\r\nwas in his mind, as being in my possession. Quick as a flash the doctor\r\nfollowed up--\r\n\r\n\"Guest.\" And Wardrop fell. \"Letters,\" he said.\r\n\r\nTo a great many words, as I said before, I could attach no significance.\r\nHere and there I got a ray.\r\n\r\n\"Elderly\" brought \"black.\"\r\n\r\n\"Warehouse.\" \"Yard,\" for no apparent reason.\r\n\r\n\"Eleven twenty-two.\" \"C\" was the answer, given without a second's\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\nEleven twenty-two C! He gave no evidence of having noticed any\r\npeculiarity in what he said; I doubt if he realized his answer. To me,\r\nhe gave the impression of repeating something he had apparently\r\nforgotten. As if a number and its association had been subconscious, and\r\nbrought to the surface by the psychologist; as if, for instance, some\r\none prompted a--b, and the corollary \"c\" came without summoning.\r\n\r\nThe psychologist took the small mouthpiece from his lips, and motioned\r\nWardrop to do the same. The test was over.\r\n\r\n\"I don't call that bad condition, Mr.--Wardrop,\" the doctor said. \"You\r\nare nervous, and you need a little more care in your habits. You want to\r\nexercise, regularly, and you will have to cut out everything in the way\r\nof stimulants for a while. Oh, yes, a couple of drinks a day at first,\r\nthen one a day, and then none. And you are to stop worrying--when\r\ntrouble comes round, and stares at you, don't ask it in to have a\r\ndrink. Take it out in the air and kill it; oxygen is as fatal to anxiety\r\nas it is to tuberculosis.\"\r\n\r\n\"How would Bellwood do?\" I asked. \"Or should it be the country?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bellwood, of course,\" the doctor responded heartily. \"Ten miles a day,\r\nfour cigarettes, and three meals--which is more than you have been\r\ntaking, Mr. Wardrop, by two.\"\r\n\r\nI put him on the train for Bellwood myself, and late that afternoon the\r\nthree of us--the doctor, Burton and myself--met in my office and went\r\nover the doctor's record.\r\n\r\n\"When the answer comes in four-fifths of a second,\" he said, before we\r\nbegan, \"it is hardly worth comment. There is no time in such an interval\r\nfor any mental reservation. Only those words that showed noticeable\r\nhesitation need be considered.\"\r\n\r\nWe worked until almost seven. At the end of that time the doctor leaned\r\nback in his chair, and thrust his hands deep in his trousers pockets.\r\n\r\n\"I got the story from Burton,\" he said, after a deep breath. \"I had no\r\nconclusion formed, and of course I am not a detective. Things looked\r\nblack for Mr. Wardrop, in view of the money lost, the quarrel with\r\nFleming that morning at the White Cat, and the circumstance of his\r\nleaving the club and hunting a doctor outside, instead of raising the\r\nalarm. Still, no two men ever act alike in an emergency. Psychology is\r\nas exact a science as mathematics; it gets information from the source,\r\nand a man can not lie in four-fifths of a second. 'Head,' you noticed,\r\nbrought 'hair' in a second and three quarters, and the next word, 'ice,'\r\nbrought the 'blood' that he had held back before. That doesn't show\r\nanything. He tried to avoid what was horrible to him.\r\n\r\n\"But I gave him 'traveling-bag;' after a pause, he responded with\r\n'train.' The next word, 'lost,' showed what was in his mind; instead of\r\n'found,' he said 'woman.' Now then, I believe he was either robbed by a\r\nwoman, or he thinks he was. After all, we can only get what he believes\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"'Money--letters,'--another slip.\r\n\r\n\"'Shot--staircase'--where are the stairs at the White Cat?\"\r\n\r\n\"I learned yesterday of a back staircase that leads into one of the\r\nupper rooms,\" I said. \"It opens on a side entrance, and is used in\r\nemergency.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor smiled confidently.\r\n\r\n\"We look there for our criminal,\" he said. \"Nothing hides from the\r\nchronoscope. Now then, 'staircase--scar.' Isn't that significant? The\r\nassociation is clear: a scar that is vivid enough, disfiguring enough,\r\nto be the first thing that enters his mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Schwartz!\" Burton said with awe. \"Doctor, what on earth does 'eleven\r\ntwenty-two C' mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that is up to you, gentlemen. The C belongs there, without\r\ndoubt. Briefly, looking over these slips, I make it something like this:\r\nWardrop thinks a woman took his traveling-bag. Three times he gave the\r\nword 'letters,' in response to 'gate,' 'guest' and 'money.' Did he have\r\na guest at the time all this happened at Bellwood?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was a guest in the house at the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you offer him money for letters?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he give you any letters to keep for him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He gave me the bag that was substituted for his.\"\r\n\r\n\"Locked?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. By Jove, I wonder if there is anything in it? I have reason to\r\nknow that he came into my room that night at least once after I went\r\nasleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it very likely,\" he said dryly. \"One thing we have not touched\r\non, and I believe Mr. Wardrop knows nothing of it. That is, the\r\ndisappearance of the old lady. There is a psychological study for you!\r\nMy conclusion? Well, I should say that Mr. Wardrop is not guilty of the\r\nmurder. He knows, or thinks he knows, who is. He has a theory of his\r\nown, about some one with a scar: it may be only a theory. He does not\r\nnecessarily know, but he hopes. He is in a state of abject fear. Also,\r\nhe is hiding something concerning letters, and from the word 'money' in\r\nthat connection, I believe he either sold or bought some damaging\r\npapers. He is not a criminal, but he is what is almost worse.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor rose and picked up his hat. \"He is a weakling,\" he said, from\r\nthe doorway.\r\n\r\nBurton looked at his watch. \"By George!\" he said. \"Seven-twenty, and\r\nI've had nothing since lunch but a box of sardines. I'm off to chase the\r\nfestive mutton chop. Oh, by the way, Knox, where is that locked bag?\"\r\n\r\n\"In my office safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll drop around in the morning and assist you to compound a felony,\"\r\nhe said easily. But as it happened, he did not.\r\n\nI was very late for dinner. Fred and Edith were getting ready for a\r\nconcert, and the two semi-invalids were playing pinochle in Fred's den.\r\nNeither one looked much the worse for her previous night's experience;\r\nMrs. Butler was always pale, and Margery had been so since her father's\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe game was over when I went into the den. As usual, Mrs. Butler left\r\nthe room almost immediately, and went to the piano across the hall. I\r\nhad grown to accept her avoidance of me without question. Fred said it\r\nwas because my overwhelming vitality oppressed her. Personally, I think\r\nit was because the neurasthenic type of woman is repulsive to me. No\r\ndoubt Mrs. Butler deserved sympathy, but her open demand for it found me\r\ncold and unresponsive.\r\n\r\nI told Margery briefly of my visit to Bellwood that morning. She was as\r\npuzzled as I was about the things Heppie had found in the chest. She\r\nwas relieved, too.\r\n\r\n\"I am just as sure, now, that she is living, as I was a week ago that\r\nshe was dead,\" she said, leaning back in her big chair. \"But what\r\nterrible thing took her away? Unless--\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless what?\"\r\n\r\n\"She had loaned my father a great deal of money,\" Margery said, with\r\nheightened color. \"She had not dared to tell Aunt Letitia, and the money\r\nwas to be returned before she found it out. Then--things went wrong with\r\nthe Borough Bank, and--the money did not come back. If you know Aunt\r\nJane, and how afraid she is of Aunt Letitia, you will understand how\r\nterrible it was for her. I have wondered if she would go--to Plattsburg,\r\nand try to find father there.\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Eagle_ man is working on that theory now,\" I replied. \"Margery, if\r\nthere was a letter 'C' added to eleven twenty-two, would you know what\r\nit meant?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head in the negative.\r\n\r\n\"Will you answer two more questions?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know why you were chloroformed last night, and who did it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I know who did it, but I don't understand. I have been trying\r\nall day to think it out. I'm afraid to go to sleep to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"You need not be,\" I assured her. \"If necessary, we will have the city\r\npolice in a ring around the house. If you know and don't tell, Margery,\r\nyou are running a risk, and more than that, you are protecting a person\r\nwho ought to be in jail.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" she persisted. \"Don't ask me about it, please.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does Mrs. Butler say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just what she said this morning. And she says valuable papers were\r\ntaken from under her pillow. She was very ill--hysterical, all\r\nafternoon.\"\r\n\r\nThe gloom and smouldering fire of the _Sonata Apassionata_ came to us\r\nfrom across the hall. I leaned over and took Margery's small hand\r\nbetween my two big ones.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you tell me?\" I urged. \"Or--you needn't tell me, I know what\r\nyou think. But there isn't any motive that I can see, and why would she\r\nchloroform you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" Margery shuddered. \"Sometimes--I wonder--do you think\r\nshe is altogether sane?\"\r\n\r\nThe music ended with the crash of a minor chord. Fred and Edith came\r\ndown the stairs, and the next moment we were all together, and the\r\nchance for a quiet conversation was gone. At the door Fred turned and\r\ncame back.\r\n\r\n\"Watch the house,\" he said. \"And by the way, I guess\"--he lowered his\r\nvoice--\"the lady's story was probably straight. I looked around again\r\nthis afternoon, and there are fresh scratches on the porch roof under\r\nher window. It looks queer, doesn't it?\"\r\n\r\nIt was a relief to know that, after all, Mrs. Butler was an enemy and a\r\ndangerous person to nobody but herself. She retired to her room almost\r\nas soon as Fred and Edith had gone. I was wondering whether or not to\r\ntell Margery about the experiment that afternoon; debating how to ask\r\nher what letters she had got from the postmaster at Bellwood addressed\r\nto Miss Jane, and what she knew of Bella. At the same time--bear with\r\nme, oh masculine reader, the gentle reader will, for she cares a great\r\ndeal more for the love story than for all the crime and mystery put\r\ntogether--bear with me, I say, if I hold back the account of the\r\nterrible events that came that night, to tell how beautiful Margery\r\nlooked as the lamplight fell on her brown hair and pure profile, and how\r\nthe impulse came over me to kiss her as she sat there; and how I didn't,\r\nafter all--poor gentle reader!--and only stooped over and kissed the\r\npink palm of her hand.\r\n\r\nShe didn't mind it; speaking as nearly as possible from an impersonal\r\nstandpoint, I doubt if she was even surprised. You see, the ring was\r\ngone and--it had only been an engagement ring anyhow, and everybody\r\nknows how binding they are!\r\n\r\nAnd then an angel with a burning sword came and scourged me out of my\r\nEden. And the angel was Burton, and the sword was a dripping umbrella.\r\n\r\n\"I hate to take you out,\" he said. \"The bottom's dropped out of the sky;\r\nbut I want you to make a little experiment with me.\" He caught sight of\r\nMargery through the porti\u00e8res, and the imp of mischief in him prompted\r\nhis next speech. \"She said she must see you,\" he said, very distinctly,\r\nand leered at me.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be an ass,\" I said angrily. \"I don't know that I care to go out\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\nHe changed his manner then.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go and take a look at the staircase you fellows have been talking\r\nabout,\" he said. \"I don't believe there is a staircase there, except the\r\nmain one. I have hounded every politician in the city into or out of\r\nthat joint, and I have never heard of it.\"\r\n\r\nI felt some hesitation about leaving the house--and Margery--after the\r\nevents of the previous night. But Margery had caught enough of the\r\nconversation to be anxious to have me to go, and when I went in to\r\nconsult her she laughed at my fears.\r\n\r\n\"Lightning never strikes twice in the same place,\" she said bravely. \"I\r\nwill ask Katie to come down with me if I am nervous, and I shall wait up\r\nfor the family.\"\r\n\r\nI went without enthusiasm. Margery's departure had been delayed for a\r\nday only, and I had counted on the evening with her. In fact, I had sent\r\nthe concert tickets to Edith with an eye single to that idea. But\r\nBurton's plan was right. It was, in view of what we knew, to go over the\r\nground at the White Cat again, and Saturday night, with the place full\r\nof men, would be a good time to look around, unnoticed.\r\n\r\n\"I don't hang so much to this staircase idea,\" Burton said, \"and I have\r\na good reason for it. I think we will find it is the warehouse, yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can depend on it, Burton,\" I maintained, \"that the staircase is the\r\nplace to look. If you had seen Wardrop's face to-day, and his agony of\r\nmind when he knew he had associated 'staircase' with 'shot,' you would\r\nthink just as I do. A man like Schwartz, who knew the ropes, could go\r\nquietly up the stairs, unbolt the door into the room, shoot Fleming and\r\nget out. Wardrop suspects Schwartz, and he's afraid of him. If he opened\r\nthe door just in time to see Schwartz, we will say, backing out the door\r\nand going down the stairs, or to see the door closing and suspect who\r\nhad just gone, we would have the whole situation, as I see it, including\r\nthe two motives of deadly hate and jealousy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose the stairs open into the back of the room? He was sitting\r\nfacing the window. Do you think Schwartz would go in, walk around the\r\ntable and shoot him from in front? Pooh! Fudge!\"\r\n\r\n\"He had a neck,\" I retorted. \"I suppose he might have turned his head to\r\nlook around.\"\r\n\r\nWe had been walking through the rain. The White Cat, as far off as the\r\npoles socially, was only a half-dozen blocks actually from the best\r\nresidence portion of the city. At the corner of the warehouse, Burton\r\nstopped and looked up at it.\r\n\r\n\"I always get mad when I look at this building,\" he said. \"My great\r\ngrandfather had a truck garden on this exact spot seventy years ago, and\r\nthe old idiot sold out for three hundred dollars and a pair of mules!\r\nHow do you get in?\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going in for?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I was wondering if I had a grudge--I have, for that matter--against the\r\nmayor, and I wanted to shoot him, how I would go about it. I think I\r\nshould find a point of vantage, like an overlooking window in an empty\r\nbuilding like this, and I would wait for a muggy night, also like this,\r\nwhen the windows were up and the lights going. I could pot him with a\r\nthirty-eight at a dozen yards, with my eyes crossed.\"\r\n\r\nWe had stopped near the arched gate where I had stood and waited for\r\nHunter, a week before. Suddenly Burton darted away from me and tried the\r\ngate. It opened easily, and I heard him splashing through a puddle in\r\nthe gloomy yard.\r\n\r\n\"Come in,\" he called softly. \"The water's fine.\"\r\n\r\nThe gate swung to behind me, and I could not see six inches from my\r\nnose. Burton caught my elbow and steered me, by touching the fence,\r\ntoward the building.\r\n\r\n\"If it isn't locked too tight,\" he was saying, \"we can get in, perhaps\r\nthrough a window, and get up-stairs. From there we ought to be able to\r\nsee down into the club. What the devil's that?\"\r\n\r\nIt was a rat, I think, and it scrambled away among the loose boards in a\r\nfrenzy of excitement. Burton struck a match; it burned faintly in the\r\ndampness, and in a moment went out, having shown us only the approximate\r\nlocation of the heavy, arched double doors. A second match showed us a\r\nbar and a rusty padlock; there was no entrance to be gained in that\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe windows were of the eight-paned variety, and in better repair than\r\nthe ones on the upper floors. By good luck, we found one unlocked and\r\nnot entirely closed; it shrieked hideously as we pried it up, but an\r\nopportune clap of thunder covered the sound.\r\n\r\nBy this time I was ready for anything that came; I was wet to my knees,\r\nmuddy, disreputable. While Burton held the window I crawled into the\r\nwarehouse, and turned to perform the same service for him. At first I\r\ncould not see him, outside. Then I heard his voice, a whisper, from\r\nbeyond the sill.\r\n\r\n\"Duck,\" he said. \"Cop!\"\r\n\r\nI dropped below the window, and above the rain I could hear the squash\r\nof the watchman's boots in the mud. He flashed a night lamp in at the\r\nwindow next to ours, but he was not very near, and the open window\r\nescaped his notice. I felt all the nervous dread of a real malefactor,\r\nand when I heard the gate close behind him, and saw Burton put a leg\r\nover the sill, I was almost as relieved as I would have been had\r\nsomebody's family plate, tied up in a tablecloth, been reposing at my\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nBurton had an instinct for getting around in the dark. I lighted another\r\nmatch as soon as he had closed the window, and we made out our general\r\ndirection toward where the stairs ought to be. When the match went out,\r\nwe felt our way in the dark; I had only one box of wax matches, and\r\nBurton had dropped his in a puddle.\r\n\r\nWe got to the second floor, finally, and without any worse mishap than\r\nBurton banging his arm against a wheel of some sort. Unlike the first\r\nfloor, the second was subdivided into rooms; it took a dozen precious\r\nmatches to find our way to the side of the building overlooking the\r\nclub, and another dozen to find the window we wanted. When we were there\r\nat last, Burton leaned his elbows on the sill, and looked down and\r\nacross.\r\n\r\n\"Could anything be better!\" he said. \"There's our theater, and we've got\r\na proscenium box. That room over there stands out like a spot-light.\"\r\n\r\nHe was right. Not more than fifteen feet away, and perhaps a foot lower\r\nthan our window, was the window of the room where Fleming had been\r\nkilled. It was empty, as far as we could see; the table, neat enough\r\nnow, was where it had been before, directly under the light. Any one who\r\nsat there would be an illuminated target from our window. Not only that,\r\nbut an arm could be steadied on the sill, allowing for an almost perfect\r\naim.\r\n\r\n\"Now, where's your staircase?\" Burton jeered.\r\n\r\nThe club was evidently full of men, as he had prophesied. Above the\r\nrattle of the rain came the thump--thump of the piano, and a half-dozen\r\nmale voices. The shutters below were closed; we could see nothing.\r\n\r\nI think it was then that Burton had his inspiration.\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet you a five-dollar bill,\" he said, \"that if I fire off my\r\nrevolver here, now, not one of those fellows down there would pay the\r\nslightest attention.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll take that bet,\" I returned. \"I'll wager that every time anybody\r\ndrops a poker, since Fleming was shot, the entire club turns out to\r\ninvestigate.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply Burton got out his revolver, and examined it by holding it\r\nagainst the light from across the way.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what I'll do,\" he said. \"Everybody down there knows me;\r\nI'll drop in for a bottle of beer, and you fire a shot into the floor\r\nhere, or into somebody across, if you happen to see any one you don't\r\ncare for. I suggest that you stay and fire the shot, because if you\r\nwent, my friend, and nobody heard it, you would accuse me of shooting\r\nfrom the back of the building somewhere.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave me the revolver and left me with a final injunction.\r\n\r\n\"Wait for ten minutes,\" he said. \"It will take five for me to get out of\r\nhere, and five more to get into the club-house. Perhaps you'd better\r\nmake it fifteen.\"\r\n\nHe went away into the darkness, and I sat down on an empty box by the\r\nwindow and waited. Had any one asked me, at that minute, how near we\r\nwere to the solution of our double mystery, I would have said we had\r\nmade no progress--save by eliminating Wardrop. Not for one instant did I\r\ndream that I was within less than half an hour of a revelation that\r\nchanged my whole conception of the crime.\r\n\r\nI timed the interval by using one of my precious matches to see my watch\r\nwhen he left. I sat there for what seemed ten minutes, listening to the\r\nrush of the rain and the creaking of a door behind me In the darkness\r\nsomewhere, that swung back and forth rustily in the draft from the\r\nbroken windows. The gloom was infinitely depressing; away from Burton's\r\nenthusiasm, his scheme lacked point; his argument, that the night\r\nduplicated the weather conditions of that other night, a week ago,\r\nseemed less worthy of consideration.\r\n\r\nBesides, I have a horror of making myself ridiculous, and I had an idea\r\nthat it would be hard to explain my position, alone in the warehouse,\r\nfiring a revolver into the floor, if my own argument was right, and the\r\nclub should rouse to a search. I looked again at my watch; only six\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nEight minutes.\r\n\r\nNine minutes.\r\n\r\nEvery one who has counted the passing of seconds knows how they drag.\r\nWith my eyes on the room across, and my finger on the trigger, I waited\r\nas best I could. At ten minutes I was conscious there was some one in\r\nthe room over the way. And then he came into view from the side\r\nsomewhere, and went to the table. He had his back to me, and I could\r\nonly see that he was a large man, with massive shoulders and dark hair.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to make out what he was doing. After a half-minute,\r\nhowever, he stepped to one side, and I saw that he had lighted a candle,\r\nand was systematically reading and then burning certain papers, throwing\r\nthe charred fragments on the table. With the same glance that told me\r\nthat, I knew the man. It was Schwartz.\r\n\r\nI was so engrossed in watching him that when he turned and came directly\r\nto the window, I stood perfectly still, staring at him. With the light\r\nat his back, I felt certain I had been discovered, but I was wrong. He\r\nshook the newspaper which had held the fragments, out of the window,\r\nlighted a cigarette and flung the match out also, and turned back into\r\nthe room. As a second thought, he went back and jerked at the cord of\r\nthe window-shade, but it refused to move.\r\n\r\nHe was not alone, for from the window he turned and addressed some one\r\nin the room behind.\r\n\r\n\"You are sure you got them all?\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe other occupant of the room came within range of vision. It was\r\nDavidson.\r\n\r\n\"All there were, Mr. Schwartz,\" he replied. \"We were nearly finished\r\nbefore the woman made a bolt.\" He was fumbling in his pockets. I think I\r\nexpected him to produce an apple and a penknife, but he held out a small\r\nobject on the palm of his hand.\r\n\r\n\"I would rather have done it alone, Mr. Schwartz,\" he said. \"I found\r\nthis ring in Brigg's pocket this morning. It belongs to the girl.\"\r\n\r\nSchwartz swore, and picking up the ring, held it to the light. Then he\r\nmade an angry motion to throw it out of the window, but his German\r\ncupidity got the better of him. He slid it into his vest pocket instead.\r\n\r\n\"You're damned poor stuff, Davidson,\" he said, with a snarl. \"If she\r\nhasn't got them, then Wardrop has. You'll bungle this job and there'll\r\nbe hell to pay. Tell McFeely I want to see him.\"\r\n\r\nDavidson left, for I heard the door close. Schwartz took the ring out\r\nand held it to the light. I looked at my watch. The time was almost up.\r\n\r\nA fresh burst of noise came from below. I leaned out cautiously and\r\nlooked down at the lower windows; they were still closed and shuttered.\r\nWhen I raised my eyes again to the level of the room across, I was\r\namazed to see a second figure in the room--a woman, at that.\r\n\r\nSchwartz had not seen her. He stood with his back to her, looking at the\r\nring in his hand. The woman had thrown her veil back, but I could see\r\nnothing of her face as she stood. She looked small beside Schwartz's\r\ntowering height, and she wore black.\r\n\r\nShe must have said something just then, very quietly, for Schwartz\r\nsuddenly lifted his head and wheeled on her. I had a clear view of him,\r\nand if ever guilt, rage, and white-lipped fear showed on a man's face,\r\nit showed on his. He replied--a half-dozen words, in a low tone, and\r\nmade a motion to offer her a chair. But she paid no attention.\r\n\r\nI have no idea how long a time they talked. The fresh outburst of noise\r\nbelow made it impossible to hear what they said, and there was always\r\nthe maddening fact that I could not see her face. I thought of Mrs.\r\nFleming, but this woman seemed younger and more slender. Schwartz was\r\narguing, I imagined, but she stood immobile, scornful, watching him. She\r\nseemed to have made a request, and the man's evasions moved her no whit.\r\n\r\nIt may have been only two or three minutes, but it seemed longer.\r\nSchwartz had given up the argument, whatever it was, and by pointing out\r\nthe window, I supposed he was telling her he had thrown what she wanted\r\nout there. Even then she did not turn toward me; I could not see even\r\nher profile.\r\n\r\nWhat happened next was so unexpected that it remains little more than a\r\npicture in my mind. The man threw out his hands as if to show he could\r\nnot or would not accede to her request; he was flushed with rage, and\r\neven at that distance the ugly scar on his forehead stood out like a\r\nwelt. The next moment I saw the woman raise her right hand, with\r\nsomething in it.\r\n\r\nI yelled to Schwartz to warn him, but he had already seen the revolver.\r\nAs he struck her hand aside, the explosion came; I saw her stagger,\r\nclutch at a chair, and fall backward beyond my range of vision.\r\n\r\nThen the light went out, and I was staring at a black, brick wall.\r\n\r\nI turned and ran frantically toward the stairs. Luckily, I found them\r\neasily. I fell rather than ran down to the floor below. Then I made a\r\nwrong turning and lost some time. My last match set me right and I got\r\ninto the yard somehow, and to the street.\r\n\r\nIt was raining harder than ever, and the thunder was incessant. I ran\r\naround the corner of the street, and found the gate to the White Cat\r\nwithout trouble. The inner gate was unlocked, as Burton had said he\r\nwould leave it, and from the steps of the club I could hear laughter and\r\nthe refrain of a popular song. The door opened just as I reached the top\r\nstep, and I half-tumbled inside.\r\n\r\nBurton was there in the kitchen, with two other men whom I did not\r\nrecognize, each one holding a stein of beer. Burton had two, and he held\r\none out to me as I stood trying to get my breath.\r\n\r\n\"You win,\" he said. \"Although I'm a hard-working journalist and need the\r\nmoney, I won't lie. This is Osborne of the _Star_ and McTighe of the\r\n_Eagle_, Mr. Knox. They heard the shot in there, and if I hadn't told\r\nthe story, there would have been a panic. What's the matter with you?\"\r\n\r\nI shut the door into the grill-room and faced the three men.\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, Burton,\" I panted, \"let's get up-stairs quietly. I\r\ndidn't fire any shot. There's a woman dead up there.\"\r\n\r\nWith characteristic poise, the three reporters took the situation\r\nquietly. We filed through the grill-room as casually as we could; with\r\nthe door closed, however, we threw caution aside. I led the way up the\r\nstairs to the room where I had found Fleming's body, and where I\r\nexpected to find another.\r\n\r\nOn the landing at the top of the stairs I came face to face with\r\nDavidson, the detective, and behind him Judge McFeely. Davidson was\r\ntrying to open the door of the room where Fleming had been shot, with a\r\nskeleton key. But it was bolted inside. There was only one thing to do:\r\nI climbed on the shoulders of one of the men, a tall fellow, whose face\r\nto this day I don't remember, and by careful maneuvering and the\r\nassistance of Davidson's long arms, I got through the transom and\r\ndropped into the room.\r\n\r\nI hardly know what I expected. I was in total darkness. I know that when\r\nI had got the door open at last, when the cheerful light from the hall\r\nstreamed in, and I had not felt Schwartz's heavy hand at my throat, I\r\ndrew a long breath of relief. Burton found the electric light switch\r\nand turned it on. And then--I could hardly believe my senses. The room\r\nwas empty.\r\n\r\nOne of the men laughed a little.\r\n\r\n\"Stung!\" he said lightly. \"What sort of a story have you and your friend\r\nframed up, Burton?\"\r\n\r\nBut I stopped at that minute and picked up a small nickel-plated\r\nrevolver from the floor. I held it out, on my palm, and the others eyed\r\nit respectfully.\r\n\r\nBurton, after all, was the quickest-witted of the lot. He threw open one\r\nof the two doors in the room, revealing a shallow closet, with papered\r\nwalls and a row of hooks. The other door stuck tight. One of the men\r\npointed to the floor; a bit of black cloth had wedged it, from the other\r\nside. Our combined efforts got it open at last, and we crowded in the\r\ndoorway, looking down a flight of stairs.\r\n\r\nHuddled just below us, her head at our feet, was the body of the missing\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n\"My God,\" Burton said hoarsely, \"who is it?\"\r\n\nWe got her into the room and on the couch before I knew her. Her fair\r\nhair had fallen loose over her face, and one long, thin hand clutched\r\nstill at the bosom of her gown. It was Ellen Butler!\r\n\r\nShe was living, but not much more. We gathered around and stood looking\r\ndown at her in helpless pity. A current of cold night air came up the\r\nstaircase from an open door below, and set the hanging light to swaying,\r\nthrowing our shadows in a sort of ghastly dance over her quiet face.\r\n\r\nI was too much shocked to be surprised. Burton had picked up her hat,\r\nand put it beside her.\r\n\r\n\"She's got about an hour, I should say,\" said one of the newspaper men.\r\n\"See if Gray is around, will you, Jim? He's mostly here Saturday night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it--Miss Maitland?\" Burton asked, in a strangely subdued voice.\r\n\r\n\"No; it is Henry Butler's widow,\" I returned, and the three men were\r\nreporters again, at once.\r\n\r\nGray was there and came immediately. Whatever surprise he may have felt\r\nat seeing a woman there, and dying, he made no comment. He said she\r\nmight live six hours, but the end was certain. We got a hospital\r\nambulance, and with the clang of its bell as it turned the corner and\r\nhurried away, the White Cat drops out of this story, so far as action is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nThree detectives and as many reporters hunted Schwartz all of that night\r\nand the next day, to get his story. But he remained in hiding. He had a\r\nstart of over an hour, from the time he switched off the light and\r\nescaped down the built-in staircase. Even in her agony, Ellen Butler's\r\nhate had carried her through the doorway after him, to collapse on the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\nI got home just as the cab, with Fred and Edith, stopped at the door. I\r\ndid not let them get out; a half dozen words, without comment or\r\nexplanation, and they were driving madly to the hospital.\r\n\r\nKatie let me in, and I gave her some money to stay up and watch the\r\nplace while we were away. Then, not finding a cab, I took a car and rode\r\nto the hospital.\r\n\r\nThe building was appallingly quiet. The elevator cage, without a light,\r\ncrept spectrally up and down; my footsteps on the tiled floor echoed and\r\nre\u00ebchoed above my head. A night watchman, in felt shoes, admitted me,\r\nand took me up-stairs.\r\n\r\nThere was another long wait while the surgeon finished his examination,\r\nand a nurse with a basin of water and some towels came out of the room,\r\nand another one with dressings went in. And then the surgeon came out,\r\nin a white coat with the sleeves rolled above his elbows, and said I\r\nmight go in.\r\n\r\nThe cover was drawn up to the injured woman's chin, where it was folded\r\nneatly back. Her face was bloodless, and her fair hair had been gathered\r\nup in a shaggy knot. She was breathing slowly, but regularly, and her\r\nexpression was relaxed--more restful than I had ever seen it. As I stood\r\nat the foot of the bed and looked down at her, I knew that as surely as\r\ndeath was coming, it would be welcome.\r\n\r\nEdith had been calm, before, but when she saw me she lost her\r\nself-control. She put her head on my shoulder, and sobbed out the shock\r\nand the horror of the thing. As for Fred, his imaginative temperament\r\nmade him particularly sensitive to suffering in others. As he sat there\r\nbeside the bed I knew by his face that he was repeating and repenting\r\nevery unkind word he had said about Ellen Butler.\r\n\r\nShe was conscious; we realized that after a time. Once she asked for\r\nwater, without opening her eyes, and Fred slipped a bit of ice between\r\nher white lips. Later in the night she looked up for an instant, at me.\r\n\r\n\"He--struck my--hand,\" she said with difficulty, and closed her eyes\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nDuring the long night hours I told the story, as I knew it, in an\r\nundertone, and there was a new kindliness in Fred's face as he looked at\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe was still living by morning, and was rallying a little from the\r\nshock. I got Fred to take Edith home, and I took her place by the bed.\r\nSome one brought me coffee about eight, and at nine o'clock I was asked\r\nto leave the room, while four surgeons held a consultation there. The\r\ndecision to operate was made shortly after.\r\n\r\n\"There is only a chance,\" a gray-haired surgeon told me in brisk,\r\nshort-clipped words. \"The bullet went down, and has penetrated the\r\nabdomen. Sometimes, taken early enough, we can repair the damage, to a\r\ncertain extent, and nature does the rest. The family is willing, I\r\nsuppose?\"\r\n\r\nI knew of no family but Edith, and over the telephone she said, with\r\nsomething of her natural tone, to do what the surgeons considered best.\r\n\r\nI hoped to get some sort of statement before the injured woman was taken\r\nto the operating-room, but she lay in a stupor, and I had to give up the\r\nidea. It was two days before I got her deposition, and in that time I\r\nhad learned many things.\r\n\r\nOn Monday I took Margery to Bellwood. She had received the news about\r\nMrs. Butler more calmly than I had expected.\r\n\r\n\"I do not think she was quite sane, poor woman,\" she said with a\r\nshudder. \"She had had a great deal of trouble. But how strange--a murder\r\nand an attempt at murder--at that little club in a week!\"\r\n\r\nShe did not connect the two, and I let the thing rest at that. Once, on\r\nthe train, she turned to me suddenly, after she had been plunged in\r\nthought for several minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think,\" she asked, \"that she had a sort of homicidal mania,\r\nand that she tried to kill me with chloroform?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hardly think so,\" I returned evasively. \"I am inclined to think some\r\none actually got in over the porch roof.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid,\" she said, pressing her gloved hands tight together.\r\n\"Wherever I go, something happens that I can not understand. I never\r\nwilfully hurt any one, and yet--these terrible things follow me. I am\r\nafraid--to go back to Bellwood, with Aunt Jane still gone, and you--in\r\nthe city.\"\r\n\r\n\"A lot of help I have been to you,\" I retorted bitterly. \"Can you think\r\nof a single instance where I have been able to save you trouble or\r\nanxiety? Why, I allowed you to be chloroformed within an inch of\r\neternity, before I found you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you did find me,\" she cheered me. \"And just to know that you are\r\ndoing all you can--\"\r\n\r\n\"My poor best,\" I supplemented.\r\n\r\n\"It is very comforting to have a friend one can rely on,\" she finished,\r\nand the little bit of kindness went to my head. If she had not got a\r\ncinder in her eye at that psychological moment, I'm afraid I would\r\nfiguratively have trampled Wardrop underfoot, right there. As it was, I\r\ngot the cinder, after a great deal of looking into one beautiful\r\neye--which is not as satisfactory by half as looking into two--and then\r\nwe were at Bellwood.\r\n\r\nWe found Miss Letitia in the lower hall, and Heppie on her knees with a\r\nhatchet. Between them sat a packing box, and they were having a spirited\r\ndiscussion as to how it should be opened.\r\n\r\n\"Here, give it to me,\" Miss Letitia demanded, as we stopped in the\r\ndoorway. \"You've got stove lengths there for two days if you don't chop\r\n'em up into splinters.\"\r\n\r\nWith the hatchet poised in mid air she saw us, but she let it descend\r\nwith considerable accuracy nevertheless, and our greeting was made\r\nbetween thumps.\r\n\r\n\"Come in\"--thump--\"like as not it's a mistake\"--bang--\"but the\r\nexpressage was prepaid. If it's mineral water--\" crash. Something broke\r\ninside.\r\n\r\n\"If it's mineral water,\" I said, \"you'd better let me open it. Mineral\r\nwater is meant for internal use, and not for hall carpets.\" I got the\r\nhatchet from her gradually. \"I knew a case once where a bottle of hair\r\ntonic was spilled on a rag carpet, and in a year they had it dyed with\r\nspots over it and called it a tiger skin.\"\r\n\r\nShe watched me suspiciously while I straightened the nails she had bent,\r\nand lifted the boards. In the matter of curiosity, Miss Letitia was\r\ntruly feminine; great handfuls of excelsior she dragged out herself, and\r\nheaped on Heppie's blue apron, stretched out on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe article that had smashed under the vigor of Miss Letitia's seventy\r\nyears lay on the top. It had been a tea-pot, of some very beautiful\r\nware. I have called just now from my study, to ask what sort of ware it\r\nwas, and the lady who sets me right says it was Crown Derby. Then there\r\nwere rows of cups and saucers, and heterogeneous articles in the same\r\nmaterial that the women folk seemed to understand. At the last, when the\r\nexcitement seemed over, they found a toast rack in a lower corner of the\r\nbox and the \"Ohs\" and \"Ahs\" had to be done all over again.\r\n\r\nNot until Miss Letitia had arranged it all on the dining-room table, and\r\nMargery had taken off her wraps and admired from all four corners, did\r\nMiss Letitia begin to ask where they had come from. And by that time\r\nHeppie had the crate in the wood-box, and the excelsior was a black and\r\nsmoking mass at the kitchen end of the grounds.\r\n\r\nThere was not the slightest clue to the sender, but while Miss Letitia\r\nrated Heppie loudly in the kitchen, and Bella swept up the hall, Margery\r\nvoiced the same idea that had occurred to me.\r\n\r\n\"If--if Aunt Jane were--all right,\" she said tremulously, \"it would be\r\njust the sort of thing she loves to do.\"\r\n\r\nI had intended to go back to the city at once, but Miss Letitia's box\r\nhad put her in an almost cheerful humor, and she insisted that I go with\r\nher to Miss Jane's room, and see how it was prepared for its owner's\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not pretending to know what took Jane Maitland away from this house\r\nin the middle of the night,\" she said. \"She was a good bit of a fool,\r\nJane was; she never grew up. But if I know Jane Maitland, she will come\r\nback and be buried with her people, if it's only to put Mary's husband\r\nout of the end of the lot.\r\n\r\n\"And another thing, Knox,\" she went on, and I saw her old hands were\r\nshaking. \"I told you the last time you were here that I hadn't been\r\nrobbed of any of the pearls, after all. Half of those pearls were Jane's\r\nand--she had a perfect right to take forty-nine of them if she wanted.\r\nShe--she told me she was going to take some, and it--slipped my mind.\"\r\n\r\nI believe it was the first lie she had ever told in her hard,\r\nconscientious old life. Was she right? I wondered. Had Miss Jane taken\r\nthe pearls, and if she had, why?\r\n\r\nWardrop had been taking a long walk; he got back about five, and as Miss\r\nLetitia was in the middle of a diatribe against white undergarments for\r\ncolored children, Margery and he had a half-hour alone together. I had\r\nknown, of course, that it must come, but under the circumstances, with\r\nmy whole future existence at stake, I was vague as to whether it was\r\ncolored undergarments on white orphans or the other way round.\r\n\r\nWhen I got away at last, I found Bella waiting for me in the hall. Her\r\neyes were red with crying, and she had a crumpled newspaper in her hand.\r\nShe broke down when she tried to speak, but I got the newspaper from\r\nher, and she pointed with one work-hardened finger to a column on the\r\nfirst page. It was the announcement of Mrs. Butler's tragic accident,\r\nand the mystery that surrounded it. There was no mention of Schwartz.\r\n\r\n\"Is she--dead?\" Bella choked out at last.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet, but there is very little hope.\"\r\n\r\nAmid fresh tears and shakings of her heavy shoulders, as she sat in her\r\nfavorite place, on the stairs, Bella told me, briefly, that she had\r\nlived with Mrs. Butler since she was sixteen, and had only left when the\r\nhusband's suicide had broken up the home. I could get nothing else out\r\nof her, but gradually Bella's share in the mystery was coming to light.\r\n\r\nSlowly, too--it was a new business for me--I was forming a theory of my\r\nown. It was a strange one, but it seemed to fit the facts as I knew\r\nthem. With the story Wardrop told that afternoon came my first glimmer\r\nof light.\r\n\r\nHe was looking better than he had when I saw him before, but the news of\r\nMrs. Butler's approaching death and the manner of her injury affected\r\nhim strangely. He had seen the paper, like Bella, and he turned on me\r\nalmost fiercely when I entered the library. Margery was in her old\r\nposition at the window, looking out, and I knew the despondent droop of\r\nher shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Is she conscious?\" Wardrop asked eagerly, indicating the article in the\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\"No, not now--at least, it is not likely.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked relieved at that, but only for a moment. Then he began to pace\r\nthe room nervously, evidently debating some move. His next action showed\r\nthe development of a resolution, for he pushed forward two chairs for\r\nMargery and myself.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, both of you,\" he directed. \"I've got a lot to say, and I want\r\nyou both to listen. When Margery has heard the whole story, she will\r\nprobably despise me for the rest of her life. I can't help it. I've got\r\nto tell all I know, and it isn't so much after all. You didn't fool me\r\nyesterday, Knox; I knew what that doctor was after. But he couldn't make\r\nme tell who killed Mr. Fleming, because, before God, I didn't know.\"\r\n\n\"I have to go back to the night Miss Jane disappeared--and that's\r\nanother thing that has driven me desperate. Will you tell me why I\r\nshould be suspected of having a hand in that, when she had been a mother\r\nto me? If she is dead, she can't exonerate me; if she is living, and we\r\nfind her, she will tell you what I tell you--that I know nothing of the\r\nwhole terrible business.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am quite certain of that, Wardrop,\" I interposed. \"Besides, I think I\r\nhave got to the bottom of that mystery.\"\r\n\r\nMargery looked at me quickly, but I shook my head. It was too early to\r\ntell my suspicions.\r\n\r\n\"The things that looked black against me were bad enough, but they had\r\nnothing to do with Miss Jane. I will have to go back to before the night\r\nshe--went away, back to the time Mr. Butler was the state treasurer,\r\nand your father, Margery, was his cashier.\r\n\r\n\"Butler was not a business man. He let too much responsibility lie with\r\nhis subordinates--and then, according to the story, he couldn't do much\r\nanyhow, against Schwartz. The cashier was entirely under machine\r\ncontrol, and Butler was neglectful. You remember, Knox, the crash, when\r\nthree banks, rotten to the core, went under, and it was found a large\r\namount of state money had gone too. It was Fleming who did it--I am\r\nsorry, Margery, but this is no time to mince words. It was Fleming who\r\ndeposited the money in the wrecked banks, knowing what would happen.\r\nWhen the crash came, Butler's sureties, to save themselves, confiscated\r\nevery dollar he had in the world. Butler went to the penitentiary for\r\nsix months, on some minor count, and when he got out, after writing to\r\nFleming and Schwartz, protesting his innocence, and asking for enough\r\nout of the fortune they had robbed him of to support his wife, he killed\r\nhimself, at the White Cat.\"\r\n\r\nMargery was very pale, but quiet. She sat with her fingers locked in\r\nher lap, and her eyes on Wardrop.\r\n\r\n\"It was a bad business,\" Wardrop went on wearily. \"Fleming moved into\r\nButler's place as treasurer, and took Lightfoot as his cashier. That\r\nkept the lid on. Once or twice, when there was an unexpected call for\r\nfunds, the treasury was almost empty, and Schwartz carried things over\r\nhimself. I went to Plattsburg as Mr. Fleming's private secretary when he\r\nbecame treasurer, and from the first I knew things were even worse than\r\nthe average state government.\r\n\r\n\"Schwartz and Fleming had to hold together; they hated each other, and\r\nthe feeling was trebled when Fleming married Schwartz's divorced wife.\"\r\n\r\nMargery looked at me with startled, incredulous eyes. What she must have\r\nseen confirmed Wardrop's words, and she leaned back in her chair, limp\r\nand unnerved. But she heard and comprehended every word Wardrop was\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\n\"The woman was a very ordinary person, but it seems Schwartz cared for\r\nher, and he tried to stab Mr. Fleming shortly after the marriage. About\r\na year ago Mr. Fleming said another attempt had been made on his life,\r\nwith poison; he was very much alarmed, and I noticed a change in him\r\nfrom that time on. Things were not going well at the treasury; Schwartz\r\nand his crowd were making demands that were hard to supply, and behind\r\nall that, Fleming was afraid to go out alone at night.\r\n\r\n\"He employed a man to protect him, a man named Carter, who had been a\r\nbartender in Plattsburg. When things began to happen here in Manchester,\r\nhe took Carter to the home as a butler.\r\n\r\n\"Then the Borough Bank got shaky. If it went down there would be an ugly\r\nscandal, and Fleming would go too. His notes for half a million were\r\nthere, without security, and he dared not show the canceled notes he\r\nhad, with Schwartz's indorsement.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not proud of the rest of the story, Margery.\" He stopped his\r\nnervous pacing and stood looking down at her. \"I was engaged to marry a\r\ngirl who was everything on earth to me, and--I was private secretary to\r\nthe state treasurer, with the princely salary of such a position!\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fleming came back here when the Borough Bank threatened failure,\r\nand tried to get money enough to tide over the trouble. A half million\r\nwould have done it, but he couldn't get it. He was in Butler's position\r\nexactly, only he was guilty and Butler was innocent. He raised a little\r\nmoney here, and I went to Plattsburg with securities and letters. It\r\nisn't necessary to go over the things I suffered there; I brought back\r\none hundred and ten thousand dollars, in a package in my Russia leather\r\nbag. And--I had something else.\"\r\n\r\nHe wavered for the first time in his recital. He went on more rapidly,\r\nand without looking at either of us.\r\n\r\n\"I carried, not in the valise, a bundle of letters, five in all, which\r\nhad been written by Henry Butler to Mr. Fleming, letters that showed\r\nwhat a dupe Butler had been, that he had been negligent, but not\r\ncriminal; accusing Fleming of having ruined him, and demanding certain\r\nnotes that would have proved it. If Butler could have produced the\r\nletters at the time of his trial, things would have been different.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you going to sell the letters?\" Margery demanded, with quick\r\nscorn.\r\n\r\n\"I intended to, but--I didn't. It was a little bit too dirty, after all.\r\nI met Mrs. Butler for the second time in my life, at the gate down\r\nthere, as I came up from the train the night I got here from Plattsburg.\r\nShe had offered to buy the letters, and I had brought them to sell to\r\nher. And then, at the last minute, I lied. I said I couldn't get\r\nthem--that they were locked in the Monmouth Avenue house. I put her in a\r\ntaxicab that she had waiting, and she went back to town. I felt like a\r\ncad; she wanted to clear her husband's memory, and I--well, Mr. Fleming\r\nwas your father, Margery, I couldn't hurt you like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think Mrs. Butler took your leather bag?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I do not think so. It seems to be the only explanation, but I did not\r\nlet it out of my hand one moment while we were talking. My hand was\r\ncramped from holding it, when she gave up in despair at last, and went\r\nback to the city.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do with the letters she wanted?\"\r\n\r\n\"I kept them with me that night, and the next morning hid them in the\r\nsecret closet. That was when I dropped my fountain pen!\"\r\n\r\n\"And the pearls?\" Margery asked suddenly. \"When did you get them,\r\nHarry?\"\r\n\r\nTo my surprise his face did not change. He appeared to be thinking.\r\n\r\n\"Two days before I left,\" he said. \"We were using every method to get\r\nmoney, and your father said to sacrifice them, if necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father!\"\r\n\r\nHe wheeled on us both.\r\n\r\n\"Did you think I stole them?\" he demanded. And I confess that I was\r\nashamed to say I had thought precisely that.\r\n\r\n\"Your father gave me nine unmounted pearls to sell,\" he reiterated. \"I\r\ngot about a thousand dollars for them--eleven hundred and something, I\r\nbelieve.\"\r\n\r\nMargery looked at me. I think she was fairly stunned. To learn that her\r\nfather had married again, that he had been the keystone in an arch of\r\nvillainy that, with him gone, was now about to fall, and to associate\r\nhim with so small and mean a thing as the theft of a handful of\r\npearls--she was fairly stunned.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" I said, to bring Wardrop back to his story, \"you found you had\r\nbeen robbed of the money, and you went in to tell Mr. Fleming. You had\r\nsome words, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He thought what you all thought,\" Wardrop said bitterly. \"He accused me\r\nof stealing the money. I felt worse than a thief. He was desperate, and\r\nI took his revolver from him.\"\r\n\r\nMargery had put her hands over her eyes. It was a terrible strain for\r\nher, but when I suggested that she wait for the rest of the story she\r\nrefused vehemently.\r\n\r\n\"I came back here to Bellwood, and the first thing I learned was about\r\nMiss Jane. When I saw the blood print on the stair rail, I thought she\r\nwas murdered, and I had more than I could stand. I took the letters out\r\nof the secret closet, before I could show it to you and Hunter, and\r\nlater I put them in the leather bag I gave you, and locked it. You have\r\nit, haven't you, Knox?\"\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n\"As for that night at the club, I told the truth then, but not all the\r\ntruth. I suppose I am a coward, but I was afraid to. If you knew\r\nSchwartz, you would understand.\"\r\n\r\nWith the memory of his huge figure and the heavy under-shot face that I\r\nhad seen the night before, I could understand very well, knowing\r\nWardrop.\r\n\r\n\"I went to that room at the White Cat that night, because I was afraid\r\nnot to go. Fleming might kill himself or some one else. I went up the\r\nstairs, slowly, and I heard no shot. At the door I hesitated, then\r\nopened it quietly. The door into the built-in staircase was just\r\nclosing. It must have taken me only an instant to realize what had\r\nhappened. Fleming was swaying forward as I caught him. I jumped to the\r\nstaircase and looked down, but I was too late. The door below had\r\nclosed. I knew in another minute who had been there, and escaped. It was\r\nraining, you remember, and Schwartz had forgotten to take his umbrella\r\nwith his name on the handle!\"\r\n\r\n\"Schwartz!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now do you understand why I was being followed?\" he demanded. \"I have\r\nbeen under surveillance every minute since that night. There's probably\r\nsome one hanging around the gate now. Anyhow, I was frantic. I saw how\r\nit looked for me, and if I had brought Schwartz into it, I would have\r\nbeen knifed in forty-eight hours. I hardly remember what I did. I know I\r\nran for a doctor, and I took the umbrella with me and left it in the\r\nvestibule of the first house I saw with a doctor's sign. I rang the bell\r\nlike a crazy man, and then Hunter came along and said to go back; Doctor\r\nGray was at the club.\r\n\r\n\"That is all I know. I'm not proud of it, Margery, but it might have\r\nbeen worse, and it's the truth. It clears up something, but not all. It\r\ndoesn't tell where Aunt Jane is, or who has the hundred thousand. But it\r\ndoes show who killed your father. And if you know what is good for you,\r\nKnox, you will let it go at that. You can't fight the police and the\r\ncourts single-handed. Look how the whole thing was dropped, and the\r\nmost cold-blooded kind of murder turned into suicide. Suicide without a\r\nweapon! Bah!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not so sure about Schwartz,\" I said thoughtfully. \"We haven't yet\r\nlearned about eleven twenty-two C.\"\r\n\nMiss Jane Maitland had been missing for ten days. In that time not one\r\nword had come from her. The reporter from the _Eagle_ had located her in\r\na dozen places, and was growing thin and haggard following little old\r\nladies along the street--and being sent about his business tartly when\r\nhe tried to make inquiries.\r\n\r\nSome things puzzled me more than ever in the light of Wardrop's story.\r\nFor the third time I asked myself why Miss Letitia denied the loss of\r\nthe pearls. There was nothing in what we had learned, either, to tell\r\nwhy Miss Jane had gone away--to ascribe a motive.\r\n\r\nHow she had gone, in view of Wardrop's story of the cab, was clear. She\r\nhad gone by street-car, walking the three miles to Wynton alone at two\r\no'clock in the morning, although she had never stirred around the house\r\nat night without a candle, and was privately known to sleep with a\r\nlight when Miss Letitia went to bed first, and could not see it through\r\nthe transom.\r\n\r\nThe theory I had formed seemed absurd at first, but as I thought it\r\nover, its probabilities grew on me. I took dinner at Bellwood and\r\nstarted for town almost immediately after.\r\n\r\nMargery had gone to Miss Letitia's room, and Wardrop was pacing up and\r\ndown the veranda, smoking. He looked dejected and anxious, and he\r\nwelcomed my suggestion that he walk down to the station with me. As we\r\nwent, a man emerged from the trees across and came slowly after us.\r\n\r\n\"You see, I am only nominally a free agent,\" he said morosely. \"They'll\r\npoison me yet; I know too much.\"\r\n\r\nWe said little on the way to the train. Just before it came thundering\r\nalong, however, he spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"I am going away, Knox. There isn't anything in this political game for\r\nme, and the law is too long. I have a chum in Mexico, and he wants me to\r\ngo down there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Permanently?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. There's nothing to hold me here now,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI turned and faced him in the glare of the station lights.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" I demanded.\r\n\r\n\"I mean that there isn't any longer a reason why one part of the earth\r\nis better than another. Mexico or Alaska, it's all the same to me.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned on his heel and left me. I watched him swing up the path, with\r\nhis head down; I saw the shadowy figure of the other man fall into line\r\nbehind him. Then I caught the platform of the last car as it passed, and\r\nthat short ride into town was a triumphal procession with the wheels\r\nbeating time and singing: \"It's all the same--the same--to me--to me.\"\r\n\r\nI called Burton by telephone, and was lucky enough to find him at the\r\noffice. He said he had just got in, and, as usual, he wanted something\r\nto eat. We arranged to meet at a little Chinese restaurant, where at\r\nthat hour, nine o'clock, we would be almost alone. Later on, after the\r\ntheater, I knew that the place would be full of people, and\r\nconversation impossible.\r\n\r\nBurton knew the place well, as he did every restaurant in the city.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Mike,\" he said to the unctuous Chinaman who admitted us. And\r\n\"Mike\" smiled a slant-eyed welcome. The room was empty; it was an\r\nunpretentious affair, with lace curtains at the windows and small, very\r\nclean tables. At one corner a cable and slide communicated through a\r\nhole in the ceiling with the floor above, and through the aperture,\r\nBurton's order for chicken and rice, and the inevitable tea, was barked.\r\n\r\nBurton listened attentively to Wardrop's story, as I repeated it.\r\n\r\n\"So Schwartz did it, after all!\" he said regretfully, when I finished.\r\n\"It's a tame ending. It had all the elements of the unusual, and it\r\nresolves itself into an ordinary, every-day, man-to-man feud. I'm\r\ndisappointed; we can't touch Schwartz.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought the _Times-Post_ was hot after him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Schwartz bought the _Times-Post_ at three o'clock this afternoon,\"\r\nBurton said, with repressed rage. \"I'm called off. To-morrow we run a\r\nphotograph of Schwartzwold, his place at Plattsburg, and the next day we\r\neulogize the administration. I'm going down the river on an excursion\r\nboat, and write up the pig-killing contest at the union butchers'\r\npicnic.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is Mrs. Butler?\" I asked, as his rage subsided to mere rumbling in\r\nhis throat.\r\n\r\n\"Delirious\"--shortly. \"She's going to croak, Wardrop's going to Mexico,\r\nSchwartz will be next governor, and Miss Maitland's body will be found\r\nin a cistern. The whole thing has petered out. What's the use of finding\r\nthe murderer if he's coated with asbestos and lined with money? Mike, I\r\nwant some more tea to drown my troubles.\"\r\n\r\nWe called up the hospital about ten-thirty, and learned that Mrs. Butler\r\nwas sinking. Fred was there, and without much hope of getting anything,\r\nwe went over. I took Burton in as a nephew of the dying woman, and I was\r\nglad I had done it. She was quite conscious, but very weak. She told the\r\nstory to Fred and myself, and in a corner Burton took it down in\r\nshorthand. We got her to sign it about daylight sometime, and she died\r\nvery quietly shortly after Edith arrived at eight.\r\n\r\nTo give her story as she gave it would be impossible; the ramblings of a\r\nsick mind, the terrible pathos of it all, is impossible to repeat. She\r\nlay there, her long, thin body practically dead, fighting the death\r\nrattle in her throat. There were pauses when for five minutes she would\r\nlie in a stupor, only to rouse and go forward from the very word where\r\nshe had stopped.\r\n\r\nShe began with her married life, and to understand the beauty of it is\r\nto understand the things that came after. She was perfectly, ideally,\r\nillogically happy. Then one day Henry Butler accepted the nomination for\r\nstate treasurer, and with that things changed. During his term in office\r\nhe altered greatly; his wife could only guess that things were wrong,\r\nfor he refused to talk.\r\n\r\nThe crash came, after all, with terrible suddenness. There had been an\r\nall-night conference at the Butler home, and Mr. Butler, in a frenzy at\r\nfinding himself a dupe, had called the butler from bed and forcibly\r\nejected Fleming and Schwartz from the house. Ellen Butler had been\r\nhorrified, sickened by what she regarded as the vulgarity of the\r\noccurrence. But her loyalty to her husband never wavered.\r\n\r\nButler was one honest man against a complete organization of\r\nunscrupulous ones. His disgrace, imprisonment and suicide at the White\r\nCat had followed in rapid succession. With his death, all that was worth\r\nwhile in his wife died. Her health was destroyed; she became one of the\r\nwretched army of neurasthenics, with only one idea: to retaliate, to pay\r\nback in measure full and running over, her wrecked life, her dead\r\nhusband, her grief and her shame.\r\n\r\nShe laid her plans with the caution and absolute recklessness of a\r\ndiseased mentality. Normally a shrinking, nervous woman, she became\r\ncold, passionless, deliberate in her revenge. To disgrace Schwartz and\r\nFleming was her original intention. But she could not get the papers.\r\n\r\nShe resorted to hounding Fleming, meaning to drive him to suicide. And\r\nshe chose a method that had more nearly driven him to madness. Wherever\r\nhe turned he found the figures eleven twenty-two C. Sometimes just the\r\nnumber, without the letter. It had been Henry Butler's cell number\r\nduring his imprisonment, and if they were graven on his wife's soul,\r\nthey burned themselves in lines of fire on Fleming's brain. For over a\r\nyear she pursued this course--sometimes through the mail, at other times\r\nin the most unexpected places, wherever she could bribe a messenger to\r\ncarry the paper. Sane? No, hardly sane, but inevitable as fate.\r\n\r\nThe time came when other things went badly with Fleming, as I had\r\nalready heard from Wardrop. He fled to the White Cat, and for a week\r\nEllen Butler hunted him vainly. She had decided to kill him, and on the\r\nnight Margery Fleming had found the paper on the pillow, she had been in\r\nthe house. She was not the only intruder in the house that night. Some\r\none--presumably Fleming himself--had been there before her. She found a\r\nladies' desk broken open and a small drawer empty. Evidently Fleming,\r\nunable to draw a check while in hiding, had needed ready money. As to\r\nthe jewels that had been disturbed in Margery's boudoir I could only\r\nsurmise the impulse that, after prompting him to take them, had failed\r\nat the sight of his dead wife's jewels. Surprised by the girl's\r\nappearance, she had crept to the upper floor and concealed herself in an\r\nempty bedroom. It had been almost dawn before she got out. No doubt this\r\nwas the room belonging to the butler, Carter, which Margery had reported\r\nas locked that night.\r\n\r\nShe took a key from the door of a side entrance, and locked the door\r\nbehind her when she left. Within a couple of nights she had learned that\r\nWardrop was coming home from Plattsburg, and she met him at Bellwood. We\r\nalready knew the nature of that meeting. She drove back to town, half\r\nmaddened by her failure to secure the letters that would have cleared\r\nher husband's memory, but the wiser by one thing: Wardrop had\r\ninadvertently told her where Fleming was hiding.\r\n\r\nThe next night she went to the White Cat and tried to get in. She knew\r\nfrom her husband of the secret staircase, for many a political meeting\r\nof the deepest significance had been possible by its use. But the door\r\nwas locked, and she had no key.\r\n\r\nAbove her the warehouse raised its empty height, and it was not long\r\nbefore she decided to see what she could learn from its upper windows.\r\nShe went in at the gate and felt her way, through the rain, to the\r\nwindows. At that moment the gate opened suddenly, and a man muttered\r\nsomething in the darkness. The shock was terrible.\r\n\r\nI had no idea, that night, of what my innocent stumbling into the\r\nwarehouse yard had meant to a half-crazed woman just beyond my range of\r\nvision. After a little she got her courage again, and she pried up an\r\nunlocked window.\r\n\r\nThe rest of her progress must have been much as ours had been, a few\r\nnights later. She found a window that commanded the club, and with three\r\npossibilities that she would lose, and would see the wrong room, she won\r\nthe fourth. The room lay directly before her, distinct in every outline,\r\nwith Fleming seated at the table, facing her and sorting some papers.\r\n\r\nShe rested her revolver on the sill and took absolutely deliberate aim.\r\nHer hands were cold, and she even rubbed them together, to make them\r\nsteady. Then she fired, and a crash of thunder at the very instant\r\ncovered the sound.\r\n\r\nFleming sat for a moment before he swayed forward. On that instant she\r\nrealized that there was some one else in the room--a man who took an\r\nuncertain step or two forward into view, threw up his hands and\r\ndisappeared as silently as he had come. It was Schwartz. Then she saw\r\nthe door into the hall open, saw Wardrop come slowly in and close it,\r\nwatched his sickening realization of what had occurred; then a sudden\r\npanic seized her. Arms seemed to stretch out from the darkness behind\r\nher, to draw her into it. She tried to get away, to run, even to\r\nscream--then she fainted. It was gray dawn when she recovered her senses\r\nand got back to the hotel room she had taken under an assumed name.\r\n\r\nBy night she was quieter. She read the news of Fleming's death in the\r\npapers, and she gloated over it. But there was more to be done; she was\r\nonly beginning. She meant to ruin Schwartz, to kill his credit, to fell\r\nhim with the club of public disfavor. Wardrop had told her that her\r\nhusband's letters were with other papers at the Monmouth Avenue house,\r\nwhere he could not get them.\r\n\r\nFleming's body was taken home that day, Saturday, but she had gone too\r\nfar to stop. She wanted the papers before Lightfoot could get at them\r\nand destroy the incriminating ones. That night she got into the Fleming\r\nhouse, using the key she had taken. She ransacked the library, finding,\r\nnot the letters that Wardrop had said were there, but others, equally or\r\nmore incriminating, canceled notes, private accounts, that would have\r\nruined Schwartz for ever.\r\n\r\nIt was then that I saw the light and went down-stairs. My unlucky\r\nstumble gave her warning enough to turn out the light. For the rest, the\r\nchase through the back hall, the dining-room and the pantry, had\r\nculminated in her escape up the back stairs, while I had fallen down the\r\ndumb-waiter shaft. She had run into Bella on the upper floor, Bella, who\r\nhad almost fainted, and who knew her and kept her until morning, petting\r\nher and soothing her, and finally getting her into a troubled sleep.\r\n\r\nThat day she realized that she was being followed. When Edith's\r\ninvitation came she accepted it at once, for the sake of losing herself\r\nand her papers, until she was ready to use them. It had disconcerted her\r\nto find Margery there, but she managed to get along. For several days\r\neverything had gone well: she was getting stronger again, ready for the\r\nsecond act of the play, prepared to blackmail Schwartz, and then expose\r\nhim. She would have killed him later, probably; she wanted her measure\r\nfull and running over, and so she would disgrace him first.\r\n\r\nThen--Schwartz must have learned of the loss of the papers from the\r\nFleming house, and guessed the rest. She felt sure he had known from the\r\nfirst who had killed Fleming. However that might be, he had had her room\r\nentered, Margery chloroformed in the connecting room, and her papers\r\nwere taken from under her pillow while she was pretending anesthesia.\r\nShe had followed the two men through the house and out the kitchen door,\r\nwhere she had fainted on the grass.\r\n\r\nThe next night, when she had retired early, leaving Margery and me\r\ndown-stairs, it had been an excuse to slip out of the house. How she\r\nfound that Schwartz was at the White Cat, how she got through the side\r\nentrance, we never knew. He had burned the papers before she got there,\r\nand when she tried to kill him, he had struck her hand aside.\r\n\r\nWhen we were out in the cheerful light of day again, Burton turned his\r\nshrewd, blue eyes on me.\r\n\r\n\"Awful story, isn't it?\" he said. \"Those are primitive emotions, if you\r\nlike. Do you know, Knox, there is only one explanation we haven't worked\r\non for the rest of this mystery--I believe in my soul you carried off\r\nthe old lady and the Russia leather bag yourself!\"\r\n\nAt noon that day I telephoned to Margery.\r\n\r\n\"Come up,\" I said, \"and bring the keys to the Monmouth Avenue house. I\r\nhave some things to tell you, and--some things to ask you.\"\r\n\r\nI met her at the station with Lady Gray and the trap. My plans for that\r\nafternoon were comprehensive; they included what I hoped to be the\r\nsolution of the Aunt Jane mystery; also, they included a little drive\r\nthrough the park, and a--well, I shall tell about that, all I am going\r\nto tell, at the proper time.\r\n\r\nTo play propriety, Edith met us at the house. It was still closed, and\r\neven in the short time that had elapsed it smelled close and musty.\r\n\r\nAt the door into the drawing-room I stopped them.\r\n\r\n\"Now, this is going to be a sort of game,\" I explained. \"It's a sort of\r\nbutton, button, who's got the button, without the button. We are\r\nlooking for a drawer, receptacle or closet, which shall contain, bunched\r\ntogether, and without regard to whether they should be there or not, a\r\nsmall revolver, two military brushes and a clothes brush, two or three\r\nsoft bosomed shirts, perhaps a half-dozen collars, and a suit of\r\nunderwear. Also a small flat package about eight inches long and three\r\nwide.\"\r\n\r\n\"What in the world are you talking about?\" Edith asked.\r\n\r\n\"I am not talking, I am theorizing,\" I explained. \"I have a theory, and\r\naccording to it the things should be here. If they are not, it is my\r\nmisfortune, not my fault.\"\r\n\r\nI think Margery caught my idea at once, and as Edith was ready for\r\nanything, we commenced the search. Edith took the top floor, being\r\naccustomed, she said, to finding unexpected things in the servants'\r\nquarters; Margery took the lower floor, and for certain reasons I took\r\nthe second.\r\n\r\nFor ten minutes there was no result. At the end of that time I had\r\nfinished two rooms, and commenced on the blue boudoir. And here, on the\r\ntop shelf of a three-cornered Empire cupboard, with glass doors and\r\nspindle legs, I found what I was looking for. Every article was there. I\r\nstuffed a small package into my pocket, and called the two girls.\r\n\r\n\"The lost is found,\" I stated calmly, when we were all together in the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\n\"When did you lose anything?\" Edith demanded. \"Do you mean to say, Jack\r\nKnox, that you brought us here to help you find a suit of gaudy pajamas\r\nand a pair of military brushes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I brought you here to find Aunt Jane,\" I said soberly, taking a letter\r\nand the flat package out of my pocket. \"You see, my theory worked out.\r\n_Here_ is Aunt Jane, and _there_ is the money from the Russia leather\r\nbag.\"\r\n\r\nI laid the packet in Margery's lap, and without ceremony opened the\r\nletter. It began:\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAREST NIECE:\r\n\r\n     \"I am writing to you, because I can not think what to say to\r\n     Sister Letitia. I am running away! I--am--running--away! My\r\n     dear, it scares me even to write it, all alone in this empty\r\n     house. I have had a cup of tea out of one of your lovely cups,\r\n     and a nap on your pretty couch, and just as soon as it is dark\r\n     I am going to take the train for Boston. When you get this, I\r\n     will be on the ocean, the ocean, my dear, that I have read\r\n     about, and dreamed about, and never seen.\r\n\r\n     \"I am going to realize a dream of forty years--more than twice\r\n     as long as you have lived. Your dear mother saw the continent\r\n     before she died, but the things I have wanted have always been\r\n     denied me. I have been of those that have eyes to see and see\r\n     not. So--I have run away. I am going to London and Paris, and\r\n     even to Italy, if the money your father gave me for the pearls\r\n     will hold out. For a year now I have been getting steamship\r\n     circulars, and I have taken a little French through a\r\n     correspondence school. That was why I always made you sing\r\n     French songs, dearie: I wanted to learn the accent. I think I\r\n     should do very well if I could only sing my French instead of\r\n     speaking it.\r\n\r\n     \"I am afraid that Sister Letitia discovered that I had taken\r\n     some of the pearls. But--half of them were mine, from our\r\n     mother, and although I had wanted a pearl ring all my life, I\r\n     have never had one. I am going to buy me a hat, instead of a\r\n     bonnet, and clothes, and pretty things underneath, and a\r\n     switch; Margery, I have wanted a switch for thirty years.\r\n\r\n     \"I suppose Letitia will never want me back. Perhaps I shall not\r\n     want to come. I tried to write to her when I was leaving, but I\r\n     had cut my hand in the attic, where I had hidden away my\r\n     clothes, and it bled on the paper. I have been worried since\r\n     for fear your Aunt Letitia would find the paper in the basket,\r\n     and be alarmed at the stains. I wanted to leave things in\r\n     order--please tell Letitia--but I was so nervous, and in such\r\n     a hurry. I walked three miles to Wynton and took a street-car.\r\n     I just made up my mind I was going to do it. I am sixty-five,\r\n     and it is time I have a chance to do the things I like.\r\n\r\n     \"I came in on the car, and came directly here. I got in with\r\n     the second key on your key-ring. Did you miss it? And I did the\r\n     strangest thing at Bellwood. I got down the stairs very quietly\r\n     and out on to the porch. I set down my empty traveling bag--I\r\n     was going to buy everything new in the city--to close the door\r\n     behind me. Then I was sure I heard some one at the side of the\r\n     house, and I picked it up and ran down the path in the dark.\r\n\r\n     \"You can imagine my surprise when I opened the bag this morning\r\n     to find I had picked up Harry's. I am emptying it and taking it\r\n     with me, for he has mine.\r\n\r\n     \"If you find this right away, please don't tell Sister Letitia\r\n     for a day or two. You know how firm your Aunt Letitia is. I\r\n     shall send her a present from Boston to pacify her, and perhaps\r\n     when I come back in three or four months, she will be over the\r\n     worst.\r\n\r\n     \"I am not quite comfortable about your father, Margery. He is\r\n     not like himself. The last time I saw him he gave me a little\r\n     piece of paper with a number on it and he said they followed\r\n     him everywhere, and were driving him crazy. Try to have him see\r\n     a doctor. And I left a bottle of complexion cream in the little\r\n     closet over my mantel, where I had hidden my hat and shoes that\r\n     I wore. Please destroy it before your Aunt Letitia sees it.\r\n\r\n     \"Good-by, my dear niece. I suppose I am growing frivolous in my\r\n     old age, but I am going to have silk linings in my clothes\r\n     before I die.\r\n\r\n     \"YOUR LOVING AUNT JANE.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Margery stopped reading, there was an amazed silence. Then we all\r\nthree burst into relieved, uncontrolled mirth. The dear, little, old\r\nlady with her new independence and her sixty-five-year-old, romantic,\r\nstarved heart!\r\n\r\nThen we opened the packet, which was a sadder business, for it had\r\nrepresented Allan Fleming's last clutch at his waning public credit.\r\n\r\nEdith ran to the telephone with the news for Fred, and for the first\r\ntime that day Margery and I were alone. She was standing with one hand\r\non the library table; in the other she held Aunt Jane's letter, half\r\ntremulous, wholly tender. I put my hand over hers, on the table.\r\n\r\n\"Margery!\" I said. She did not stir.\r\n\r\n\"Margery, I want my answer, dear. I love you--love you; it isn't\r\npossible to tell you how much. There isn't enough time in all existence\r\nto tell you. You are mine, Margery--mine. You can't get away from that.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned, very slowly, and looked at me with her level eyes. \"Yours!\"\r\nshe replied softly, and I took her in my arms.\r\n\r\nEdith was still at the telephone.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" she was saying. \"Just wait until I see.\"\r\n\r\nAs she came toward the door, Margery squirmed, but I held her tight. In\r\nthe doorway Edith stopped and stared; then she went swiftly back to the\r\ntelephone.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear,\" she said sweetly. \"They are, this minute.\"\r\n\n", "The Man in Lower Ten": "McKnight is gradually taking over the criminal end of the business. I\r\nnever liked it, and since the strange case of the man in lower ten, I\r\nhave been a bit squeamish. Given a case like that, where you can\r\nbuild up a network of clues that absolutely incriminate three entirely\r\ndifferent people, only one of whom can be guilty, and your faith in\r\ncircumstantial evidence dies of overcrowding. I never see a shivering,\r\nwhite-faced wretch in the prisoners' dock that I do not hark back with\r\nshuddering horror to the strange events on the Pullman car Ontario,\r\nbetween Washington and Pittsburg, on the night of September ninth, last.\r\n\r\nMcKnight could tell the story a great deal better than I, although\r\nhe can not spell three consecutive words correctly. But, while he has\r\nimagination and humor, he is lazy.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt didn't happen to me, anyhow,\u201d he protested, when I put it up to\r\nhim. \u201cAnd nobody cares for second-hand thrills. Besides, you want the\r\nunvarnished and ungarnished truth, and I'm no hand for that. I'm a\r\nlawyer.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo am I, although there have been times when my assumption in that\r\nparticular has been disputed. I am unmarried, and just old enough to\r\ndance with the grown-up little sisters of the girls I used to know. I\r\nam fond of outdoors, prefer horses to the aforesaid grown-up little\r\nsisters, am without sentiment (am crossed out and was substituted.-Ed.)\r\nand completely ruled and frequently routed by my housekeeper, an elderly\r\nwidow.\r\n\r\nIn fact, of all the men of my acquaintance, I was probably the most\r\nprosaic, the least adventurous, the one man in a hundred who would be\r\nlikely to go without a deviation from the normal through the orderly\r\nprocession of the seasons, summer suits to winter flannels, golf to\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\nSo it was a queer freak of the demons of chance to perch on my\r\nunsusceptible thirty-year-old chest, tie me up with a crime, ticket\r\nme with a love affair, and start me on that sensational and not always\r\nrespectable journey that ended so surprisingly less than three weeks\r\nlater in the firm's private office. It had been the most remarkable\r\nperiod of my life. I would neither give it up nor live it again under\r\nany inducement, and yet all that I lost was some twenty yards off my\r\ndrive!\r\n\r\nIt was really McKnight's turn to make the next journey. I had a\r\ntournament at Chevy Chase for Saturday, and a short yacht cruise planned\r\nfor Sunday, and when a man has been grinding at statute law for a week,\r\nhe needs relaxation. But McKnight begged off. It was not the first time\r\nhe had shirked that summer in order to run down to Richmond, and I was\r\nsurly about it. But this time he had a new excuse. \u201cI wouldn't be able\r\nto look after the business if I did go,\u201d he said. He has a sort of\r\nwide-eyed frankness that makes one ashamed to doubt him. \u201cI'm always car\r\nsick crossing the mountains. It's a fact, Lollie. See-sawing over the\r\npeaks does it. Why, crossing the Alleghany Mountains has the Gulf Stream\r\nto Bermuda beaten to a frazzle.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo I gave him up finally and went home to pack. He came later in the\r\nevening with his machine, the Cannonball, to take me to the station, and\r\nhe brought the forged notes in the Bronson case.\r\n\r\n\u201cGuard them with your life,\u201d he warned me. \u201cThey are more precious\r\nthan honor. Sew them in your chest protector, or wherever people keep\r\nvaluables. I never keep any. I'll not be happy until I see Gentleman\r\nAndy doing the lockstep.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe sat down on my clean collars, found my cigarettes and struck a match\r\non the mahogany bed post with one movement.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere's the Pirate?\u201d he demanded. The Pirate is my housekeeper, Mrs.\r\nKlopton, a very worthy woman, so labeled--and libeled--because of a\r\nferocious pair of eyes and what McKnight called a bucaneering nose. I\r\nquietly closed the door into the hall.\r\n\r\n\u201cKeep your voice down, Richey,\u201d I said. \u201cShe is looking for the evening\r\npaper to see if it is going to rain. She has my raincoat and an umbrella\r\nwaiting in the hall.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe collars being damaged beyond repair, he left them and went to the\r\nwindow. He stood there for some time, staring at the blackness that\r\nrepresented the wall of the house next door.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's raining now,\u201d he said over his shoulder, and closed the window\r\nand the shutters. Something in his voice made me glance up, but he was\r\nwatching me, his hands idly in his pockets.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho lives next door?\u201d he inquired in a perfunctory tone, after a pause.\r\nI was packing my razor.\r\n\r\n\u201cHouse is empty,\u201d I returned absently. \u201cIf the landlord would put it in\r\nsome sort of shape---\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you put those notes in your pocket?\u201d he broke in.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d I was impatient. \u201cAlong with my certificates of registration,\r\nbaptism and vaccination. Whoever wants them will have to steal my coat\r\nto get them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I would move them, if I were you. Somebody in the next house was\r\nconfoundedly anxious to see where you put them. Somebody right at that\r\nwindow opposite.\u201d\r\n\r\nI scoffed at the idea, but nevertheless I moved the papers, putting\r\nthem in my traveling-bag, well down at the bottom. McKnight watched me\r\nuneasily.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have a hunch that you are going to have trouble,\u201d he said, as I\r\nlocked the alligator bag. \u201cDarned if I like starting anything important\r\non Friday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a congenital dislike to start anything on any old day,\u201d I\r\nretorted, still sore from my lost Saturday. \u201cAnd if you knew the owner\r\nof that house as I do you would know that if there was any one at that\r\nwindow he is paying rent for the privilege.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Klopton rapped at the door and spoke discreetly from the hall.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid Mr. McKnight bring the evening paper?\u201d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\u201cSorry, but I didn't, Mrs. Klopton,\u201d McKnight called. \u201cThe Cubs won,\r\nthree to nothing.\u201d He listened, grinning, as she moved away with little\r\nirritated rustles of her black silk gown.\r\n\r\nI finished my packing, changed my collar and was ready to go. Then very\r\ncautiously we put out the light and opened the shutters. The window\r\nacross was merely a deeper black in the darkness. It was closed and\r\ndirty. And yet, probably owing to Richey's suggestion, I had an uneasy\r\nsensation of eyes staring across at me. The next moment we were at the\r\ndoor, poised for flight.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe'll have to run for it,\u201d I said in a whisper. \u201cShe's down there with\r\na package of some sort, sandwiches probably. And she's threatened me\r\nwith overshoes for a month. Ready now!\u201d\r\n\r\nI had a kaleidoscopic view of Mrs. Klopton in the lower hall, holding\r\nout an armful of such traveling impedimenta as she deemed essential,\r\nwhile beside her, Euphemia, the colored housemaid, grinned over a\r\nwhite-wrapped box.\r\n\r\n\u201cAwfully sorry-no time-back Sunday,\u201d I panted over my shoulder. Then the\r\ndoor closed and the car was moving away.\r\n\r\nMcKnight bent forward and stared at the facade of the empty house next\r\ndoor as we passed. It was black, staring, mysterious, as empty buildings\r\nare apt to be.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'd like to hold a post-mortem on that corpse of a house,\u201d he said\r\nthoughtfully. \u201cBy George, I've a notion to get out and take a look.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSomebody after the brass pipes,\u201d I scoffed. \u201cHouse has been empty for a\r\nyear.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith one hand on the steering wheel McKnight held out the other for my\r\ncigarette case. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d he said; \u201cbut I don't see what she would want\r\nwith brass pipe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA woman!\u201d I laughed outright. \u201cYou have been looking too hard at the\r\npicture in the back of your watch, that's all. There's an experiment\r\nlike that: if you stare long enough--\u201d\r\n\r\nBut McKnight was growing sulky: he sat looking rigidly ahead, and he\r\ndid not speak again until he brought the Cannonball to a stop at the\r\nstation. Even then it was only a perfunctory remark. He went through the\r\ngate with me, and with five minutes to spare, we lounged and smoked\r\nin the train shed. My mind had slid away from my surroundings and had\r\nwandered to a polo pony that I couldn't afford and intended to buy\r\nanyhow. Then McKnight shook off his taciturnity.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor heaven's sake, don't look so martyred,\u201d he burst out; \u201cI know\r\nyou've done all the traveling this summer. I know you're missing a game\r\nto-morrow. But don't be a patient mother; confound it, I have to go to\r\nRichmond on Sunday. I--I want to see a girl.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, don't mind me,\u201d I observed politely. \u201cPersonally, I wouldn't change\r\nplaces with you. What's her name--North? South?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWest,\u201d he snapped. \u201cDon't try to be funny. And all I have to say,\r\nBlakeley, is that if you ever fall in love I hope you make an egregious\r\nass of yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn view of what followed, this came rather close to prophecy.\r\n\r\nThe trip west was without incident. I played bridge with a furniture\r\ndealer from Grand Rapids, a sales agent for a Pittsburg iron firm and\r\na young professor from an eastern college. I won three rubbers out of\r\nfour, finished what cigarettes McKnight had left me, and went to bed\r\nat one o'clock. It was growing cooler, and the rain had ceased. Once,\r\ntoward morning, I wakened with a start, for no apparent reason, and sat\r\nbolt upright. I had an uneasy feeling that some one had been looking at\r\nme, the same sensation I had experienced earlier in the evening at the\r\nwindow. But I could feel the bag with the notes, between me and the\r\nwindow, and with my arm thrown over it for security, I lapsed again into\r\nslumber. Later, when I tried to piece together the fragments of that\r\njourney, I remembered that my coat, which had been folded and placed\r\nbeyond my restless tossing, had been rescued in the morning from a\r\nheterogeneous jumble of blankets, evening papers and cravat, had been\r\nshaken out with profanity and donned with wrath. At the time, nothing\r\noccurred to me but the necessity of writing to the Pullman Company and\r\nasking them if they ever traveled in their own cars. I even formulated\r\nsome of the letter.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf they are built to scale, why not take a man of ordinary stature\r\nas your unit?\u201d I wrote mentally. \u201cI can not fold together like the\r\ntraveling cup with which I drink your abominable water.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was more cheerful after I had had a cup of coffee in the Union\r\nStation. It was too early to attend to business, and I lounged in the\r\nrestaurant and hid behind the morning papers. As I had expected, they\r\nhad got hold of my visit and its object. On the first page was a staring\r\nannouncement that the forged papers in the Bronson case had been\r\nbrought to Pittsburg. Underneath, a telegram from Washington stated that\r\nLawrence Blakeley, of Blakeley and McKnight, had left for Pittsburg the\r\nnight before, and that, owing to the approaching trial of the Bronson\r\ncase and the illness of John Gilmore, the Pittsburg millionaire, who was\r\nthe chief witness for the prosecution, it was supposed that the visit\r\nwas intimately concerned with the trial.\r\n\r\nI looked around apprehensively. There were no reporters yet in sight,\r\nand thankful to have escaped notice I paid for my breakfast and left.\r\nAt the cab-stand I chose the least dilapidated hansom I could find, and\r\ngiving the driver the address of the Gilmore residence, in the East end,\r\nI got in.\r\n\r\nI was just in time. As the cab turned and rolled off, a slim young man\r\nin a straw hat separated himself from a little group of men and hurried\r\ntoward us.\r\n\r\n\u201cHey! Wait a minute there!\u201d he called, breaking into a trot.\r\n\r\nBut the cabby did not hear, or perhaps did not care to. We jogged\r\ncomfortably along, to my relief, leaving the young man far behind. I\r\navoid reporters on principle, having learned long ago that I am an easy\r\nmark for a clever interviewer.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps nine o'clock when I left the station. Our way was along\r\nthe boulevard which hugged the side of one of the city's great hills.\r\nFar below, to the left, lay the railroad tracks and the seventy times\r\nseven looming stacks of the mills. The white mist of the river, the\r\ngrays and blacks of the smoke blended into a half-revealing haze, dotted\r\nhere and there with fire. It was unlovely, tremendous. Whistler might\r\nhave painted it with its pathos, its majesty, but he would have missed\r\nwhat made it infinitely suggestive--the rattle and roar of iron on iron,\r\nthe rumble of wheels, the throbbing beat, against the ears, of fire and\r\nheat and brawn welding prosperity.\r\n\r\nSomething of this I voiced to the grim old millionaire who was\r\nresponsible for at least part of it. He was propped up in bed in his\r\nEast end home, listening to the market reports read by a nurse, and he\r\nsmiled a little at my enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can't see much beauty in it myself,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it's our badge\r\nof prosperity. The full dinner pail here means a nose that looks like a\r\nflue. Pittsburg without smoke wouldn't be Pittsburg, any more than New\r\nYork without prohibition would be New York. Sit down for a few minutes,\r\nMr. Blakeley. Now, Miss Gardner, Westinghouse Electric.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe nurse resumed her reading in a monotonous voice. She read literally\r\nand without understanding, using initials and abbreviations as they\r\ncame. But the shrewd old man followed her easily. Once, however, he\r\nstopped her.\r\n\r\n\u201cD-o is ditto,\u201d he said gently, \u201cnot do.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the nurse droned along, I found myself looking curiously at a\r\nphotograph in a silver frame on the bed-side table. It was the picture\r\nof a girl in white, with her hands clasped loosely before her. Against\r\nthe dark background her figure stood out slim and young. Perhaps it was\r\nthe rather grim environment, possibly it was my mood, but although as a\r\ngeneral thing photographs of young girls make no appeal to me, this one\r\ndid. I found my eyes straying back to it. By a little finesse I even\r\nmade out the name written across the corner, \u201cAlison.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Gilmore lay back among his pillows and listened to the nurse's\r\nlistless voice. But he was watching me from under his heavy eyebrows,\r\nfor when the reading was over, and we were alone, he indicated the\r\npicture with a gesture.\r\n\r\n\u201cI keep it there to remind myself that I am an old man,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\r\nis my granddaughter, Alison West.\u201d\r\n\r\nI expressed the customary polite surprise, at which, finding me\r\nresponsive, he told me his age with a chuckle of pride. More surprise,\r\nthis time genuine. From that we went to what he ate for breakfast\r\nand did not eat for luncheon, and then to his reserve power, which at\r\nsixty-five becomes a matter for thought. And so, in a wide circle, back\r\nto where we started, the picture.\r\n\r\n\u201cFather was a rascal,\u201d John Gilmore said, picking up the frame. \u201cThe\r\nhappiest day of my life was when I knew he was safely dead in bed and\r\nnot hanged. If the child had looked like him, I--well, she doesn't.\r\nShe's a Gilmore, every inch. Supposed to look like me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery noticeably,\u201d I agreed soberly.\r\n\r\nI had produced the notes by that time, and replacing the picture Mr.\r\nGilmore gathered his spectacles from beside it. He went over the four\r\nnotes methodically, examining each carefully and putting it down before\r\nhe picked up the next. Then he leaned back and took off his glasses.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey're not so bad,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cNot so bad. But I never saw\r\nthem before. That's my unofficial signature. I am inclined to think--\u201d\r\n he was speaking partly to himself--\u201cto think that he has got hold of\r\na letter of mine, probably to Alison. Bronson was a friend of her\r\nrapscallion of a father.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took Mr. Gilmore's deposition and put it into my traveling-bag with\r\nthe forged notes. When I saw them again, almost three weeks later, they\r\nwere unrecognizable, a mass of charred paper on a copper ashtray. In the\r\ninterval other and bigger things had happened: the Bronson forgery case\r\nhad shrunk beside the greater and more imminent mystery of the man in\r\nlower ten. And Alison West had come into the story and into my life.\r\n\nI lunched alone at the Gilmore house, and went back to the city at once.\r\nThe sun had lifted the mists, and a fresh summer wind had cleared away\r\nthe smoke pall. The boulevard was full of cars flying countryward for\r\nthe Saturday half-holiday, toward golf and tennis, green fields and\r\nbabbling girls. I gritted my teeth and thought of McKnight at Richmond,\r\nvisiting the lady with the geographical name. And then, for the first\r\ntime, I associated John Gilmore's granddaughter with the \u201cWest\u201d that\r\nMcKnight had irritably flung at me.\r\n\r\nI still carried my traveling-bag, for McKnight's vision at the window\r\nof the empty house had not been without effect. I did not transfer\r\nthe notes to my pocket, and, if I had, it would not have altered the\r\nsituation later. Only the other day McKnight put this very thing up to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\u201cI warned you,\u201d he reminded me. \u201cI told you there were queer things\r\ncoming, and to be on your guard. You ought to have taken your revolver.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would have been of exactly as much use as a bucket of snow in\r\nAfrica,\u201d I retorted. \u201cIf I had never closed my eyes, or if I had kept\r\nmy finger on the trigger of a six-shooter (which is novelesque for\r\nrevolver), the result would have been the same. And the next time you\r\nwant a little excitement with every variety of thrill thrown in, I can\r\nput you by way of it. You begin by getting the wrong berth in a Pullman\r\ncar, and end--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I know how it ends,\u201d he finished shortly. \u201cDon't you suppose the\r\nwhole thing's written on my spinal marrow?\u201d\r\n\r\nBut I am wandering again. That is the difficulty with the unprofessional\r\nstory-teller: he yaws back and forth and can't keep in the wind; he\r\ndrops his characters overboard when he hasn't any further use for them\r\nand drowns them; he forgets the coffee-pot and the frying-pan and all\r\nthe other small essentials, and, if he carries a love affair, he\r\nmutters a fervent \u201cAllah be praised\u201d when he lands them, drenched with\r\nadventures, at the matrimonial dock at the end of the final chapter.\r\n\r\nI put in a thoroughly unsatisfactory afternoon. Time dragged eternally.\r\nI dropped in at a summer vaudeville, and bought some ties at a\r\nhaberdasher's. I was bored but unexpectant; I had no premonition of what\r\nwas to come. Nothing unusual had ever happened to me; friends of mine\r\nhad sometimes sailed the high seas of adventure or skirted the coasts of\r\nchance, but all of the shipwrecks had occurred after a woman passenger\r\nhad been taken on. \u201cErgo,\u201d I had always said \u201cno women!\u201d I repeated\r\nit to myself that evening almost savagely, when I found my thoughts\r\nstraying back to the picture of John Gilmore's granddaughter. I even\r\nargued as I ate my solitary dinner at a downtown restaurant.\r\n\r\n\u201cHaven't you troubles enough,\u201d I reflected, \u201cwithout looking for more?\r\nHasn't Bad News gone lame, with a matinee race booked for next week?\r\nOtherwise aren't you comfortable? Isn't your house in order? Do you want\r\nto sell a pony in order to have the library done over in mission or the\r\ndrawing-room in gold? Do you want somebody to count the empty cigarette\r\nboxes lying around every morning?\u201d\r\n\r\nLay it to the long idle afternoon, to the new environment, to anything\r\nyou like, but I began to think that perhaps I did. I was confoundedly\r\nlonely. For the first time in my life its even course began to waver:\r\nthe needle registered warning marks on the matrimonial seismograph,\r\nlines vague enough, but lines.\r\n\r\nMy alligator bag lay at my feet, still locked. While I waited for my\r\ncoffee I leaned back and surveyed the people incuriously. There were the\r\nusual couples intent on each other: my new state of mind made me regard\r\nthem with tolerance. But at the next table, where a man and woman dined\r\ntogether, a different atmosphere prevailed. My attention was first\r\ncaught by the woman's face. She had been speaking earnestly across the\r\ntable, her profile turned to me. I had noticed casually her earnest\r\nmanner, her somber clothes, and the great mass of odd, bronze-colored\r\nhair on her neck. But suddenly she glanced toward me and the utter\r\nhopelessness--almost tragedy--of her expression struck me with a shock.\r\nShe half closed her eyes and drew a long breath, then she turned again\r\nto the man across the table.\r\n\r\nNeither one was eating. He sat low in his chair, his chin on his chest,\r\nugly folds of thick flesh protruding over his collar. He was probably\r\nfifty, bald, grotesque, sullen, and yet not without a suggestion of\r\npower. But he had been drinking; as I looked, he raised an unsteady hand\r\nand summoned a waiter with a wine list.\r\n\r\nThe young woman bent across the table and spoke again quickly. She had\r\nunconsciously raised her voice. Not beautiful, in her earnestness and\r\nstress she rather interested me. I had an idle inclination to advise the\r\nwaiter to remove the bottled temptation from the table. I wonder\r\nwhat would have happened if I had? Suppose Harrington had not been\r\nintoxicated when he entered the Pullman car Ontario that night!\r\n\r\nFor they were about to make a journey, I gathered, and the young woman\r\nwished to go alone. I drank three cups of coffee, which accounted for\r\nmy wakefulness later, and shamelessly watched the tableau before me.\r\nThe woman's protest evidently went for nothing: across the table the man\r\ngrunted monosyllabic replies and grew more and more lowering and sullen.\r\nOnce, during a brief unexpected pianissimo in the music, her voice came\r\nto me sharply:\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I could only see him in time!\u201d she was saying. \u201cOh, it's terrible!\u201d\r\n\r\nIn spite of my interest I would have forgotten the whole incident\r\nat once, erased it from my mind as one does the inessentials and\r\nclutterings of memory, had I not met them again, later that evening,\r\nin the Pennsylvania station. The situation between them had not visibly\r\naltered: the same dogged determination showed in the man's face, but the\r\nyoung woman--daughter or wife? I wondered--had drawn down her veil and I\r\ncould only suspect what white misery lay beneath.\r\n\r\nI bought my berth after waiting in a line of some eight or ten people.\r\nWhen, step by step, I had almost reached the window, a tall woman whom\r\nI had not noticed before spoke to me from my elbow. She had a ticket and\r\nmoney in her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you try to get me a lower when you buy yours?\u201d she asked. \u201cI have\r\ntraveled for three nights in uppers.\u201d\r\n\r\nI consented, of course; beyond that I hardly noticed the woman. I had a\r\nvague impression of height and a certain amount of stateliness, but the\r\ncrowd was pushing behind me, and some one was standing on my foot. I got\r\ntwo lowers easily, and, turning with the change and berths, held out the\r\ntickets.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich will you have?\u201d I asked. \u201cLower eleven or lower ten?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt makes no difference,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you very much indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt random I gave her lower eleven, and called a porter to help her\r\nwith her luggage. I followed them leisurely to the train shed, and ten\r\nminutes more saw us under way.\r\n\r\nI looked into my car, but it presented the peculiarly unattractive\r\nappearance common to sleepers. The berths were made up; the center aisle\r\nwas a path between walls of dingy, breeze-repelling curtains, while\r\nthe two seats at each end of the car were piled high with suitcases and\r\numbrellas. The perspiring porter was trying to be six places at once:\r\nsomebody has said that Pullman porters are black so they won't show the\r\ndirt, but they certainly show the heat.\r\n\r\nNine-fifteen was an outrageous hour to go to bed, especially since I\r\nsleep little or not at all on the train, so I made my way to the smoker\r\nand passed the time until nearly eleven with cigarettes and a magazine.\r\nThe car was very close. It was a warm night, and before turning in I\r\nstood a short time in the vestibule. The train had been stopping\r\nat frequent intervals, and, finding the brakeman there, I asked the\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that there was a hot-box on the next car, and that not only\r\nwere we late, but we were delaying the second section, just behind. I\r\nwas beginning to feel pleasantly drowsy, and the air was growing cooler\r\nas we got into the mountains. I said good night to the brakeman and\r\nwent back to my berth. To my surprise, lower ten was already occupied--a\r\nsuit-case projected from beneath, a pair of shoes stood on the floor,\r\nand from behind the curtains came the heavy, unmistakable breathing of\r\ndeep sleep. I hunted out the porter and together we investigated.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you asleep, sir?\u201d asked the porter, leaning over deferentially.\r\nNo answer forthcoming, he opened the curtains and looked in. Yes, the\r\nintruder was asleep--very much asleep--and an overwhelming odor of\r\nwhisky proclaimed that he would probably remain asleep until morning. I\r\nwas irritated. The car was full, and I was not disposed to take an upper\r\nin order to allow this drunken interloper to sleep comfortably in my\r\nberth.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou'll have to get out of this,\u201d I said, shaking him angrily. But he\r\nmerely grunted and turned over. As he did so, I saw his features for the\r\nfirst time. It was the quarrelsome man of the restaurant.\r\n\r\nI was less disposed than ever to relinquish my claim, but the\r\nporter, after a little quiet investigation, offered a solution of the\r\ndifficulty. \u201cThere's no one in lower nine,\u201d he suggested, pulling open\r\nthe curtains just across. \u201cIt's likely nine's his berth, and he's made a\r\nmistake, owing to his condition. You'd better take nine, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nI did, with a firm resolution that if nine's rightful owner turned up\r\nlater I should be just as unwakable as the man opposite. I undressed\r\nleisurely, making sure of the safety of the forged notes, and placing my\r\ngrip as before between myself and the window.\r\n\r\nBeing a man of systematic habits, I arranged my clothes carefully,\r\nputting my shoes out for the porter to polish, and stowing my collar and\r\nscarf in the little hammock swung for the purpose.\r\n\r\nAt last, with my pillows so arranged that I could see out comfortably,\r\nand with the unhygienic-looking blanket turned back--I have always a\r\ndistrust of those much-used affairs--I prepared to wait gradually for\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nBut sleep did not visit me. The train came to frequent, grating stops,\r\nand I surmised the hot box again. I am not a nervous man, but there was\r\nsomething chilling in the thought of the second section pounding along\r\nbehind us. Once, as I was dozing, our locomotive whistled a shrill\r\nwarning--\u201cYou keep back where you belong,\u201d it screamed to my drowsy\r\nears, and from somewhere behind came a chastened \u201cAll-right-I-will.\u201d\r\n\r\nI grew more and more wide-awake. At Cresson I got up on my elbow and\r\nblinked out at the station lights. Some passengers boarded the train\r\nthere and I heard a woman's low tones, a southern voice, rich and\r\nfull. Then quiet again. Every nerve was tense: time passed, perhaps ten\r\nminutes, possibly half an hour. Then, without the slightest warning, as\r\nthe train rounded a curve, a heavy body was thrown into my berth. The\r\nincident, trivial as it seemed, was startling in its suddenness, for\r\nalthough my ears were painfully strained and awake, I had heard no step\r\noutside. The next instant the curtain hung limp again; still without a\r\nsound, my disturber had slipped away into the gloom and darkness. In a\r\nfrenzy of wakefulness, I sat up, drew on a pair of slippers and fumbled\r\nfor my bath-robe.\r\n\r\nFrom a berth across, probably lower ten, came that particular\r\naggravating snore which begins lightly, delicately, faintly soprano,\r\ngoes down the scale a note with every breath, and, after keeping the\r\nlistener tense with expectation, ends with an explosion that tears the\r\nvery air. I was more and more irritable: I sat on the edge of the berth\r\nand hoped the snorer would choke to death. He had considerable vitality,\r\nhowever; he withstood one shock after another and survived to start\r\nagain with new vigor. In desperation I found some cigarettes and one\r\nmatch, piled my blankets over my grip, and drawing the curtains together\r\nas though the berth were still occupied, I made my way to the vestibule\r\nof the car.\r\n\r\nI was not clad for dress parade. Is it because the male is so restricted\r\nto gloom in his every-day attire that he blossoms into gaudy colors in\r\nhis pajamas and dressing-gowns? It would take a Turk to feel at\r\nhome before an audience in my red and yellow bathrobe, a Christmas\r\nremembrance from Mrs. Klopton, with slippers to match.\r\n\r\nSo, naturally, when I saw a feminine figure on the platform, my first\r\ninstinct was to dodge. The woman, however, was quicker than I; she\r\ngave me a startled glance, wheeled and disappeared, with a flash of two\r\nbronze-colored braids, into the next car.\r\n\r\nCigarette box in one hand, match in the other, I leaned against the\r\nuncertain frame of the door and gazed after her vanished figure. The\r\nmountain air flapped my bath-robe around my bare ankles, my one match\r\nburned to the end and went out, and still I stared. For I had seen\r\non her expressive face a haunting look that was horror, nothing less.\r\nHeaven knows, I am not psychological. Emotions have to be written large\r\nbefore I can read them. But a woman in trouble always appeals to me, and\r\nthis woman was more than that. She was in deadly fear.\r\n\r\nIf I had not been afraid of being ridiculous, I would have followed\r\nher. But I fancied that the apparition of a man in a red and yellow\r\nbath-robe, with an unkempt thatch of hair, walking up to her and\r\nassuring her that he would protect her would probably put her into\r\nhysterics. I had done that once before, when burglars had tried to break\r\ninto the house, and had startled the parlor maid into bed for a week.\r\nSo I tried to assure myself that I had imagined the lady's distress--or\r\ncaused it, perhaps--and to dismiss her from my mind. Perhaps she was\r\nmerely anxious about the unpleasant gentleman of the restaurant. I\r\nthought smugly that I could have told her all about him: that he was\r\nsleeping the sleep of the just and the intoxicated in a berth that\r\nought, by all that was fair and right, to have been mine, and that if I\r\nwere tied to a man who snored like that I should have him anesthetized\r\nand his soft palate put where it would never again flap like a loose\r\nsail in the wind.\r\n\r\nWe passed Harrisburg as I stood there. It was starlight, and the great\r\ncrests of the Alleghanies had given way to low hills. At intervals we\r\npassed smudges of gray white, no doubt in daytime comfortable farms,\r\nwhich McKnight says is a good way of putting it, the farms being a lot\r\nmore comfortable than the people on them.\r\n\r\nI was growing drowsy: the woman with the bronze hair and the horrified\r\nface was fading in retrospect. It was colder, too, and I turned with a\r\nshiver to go in. As I did so a bit of paper fluttered into the air and\r\nsettled on my sleeve, like a butterfly on a gorgeous red and yellow\r\nblossom. I picked it up curiously and glanced at it. It was part of a\r\ntelegram that had been torn into bits.\r\n\r\nThere were only parts of four words on the scrap, but it left me puzzled\r\nand thoughtful. It read, \u201c-ower ten, car seve-.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLower ten, car seven,\u201d was my berth-the one I had bought and found\r\npreempted.\r\n\nNo solution offering itself, I went back to my berth. The snorer across\r\nhad apparently strangled, or turned over, and so after a time I dropped\r\nasleep, to be awakened by the morning sunlight across my face.\r\n\r\nI felt for my watch, yawning prodigiously. I reached under the pillow\r\nand failed to find it, but something scratched the back of my hand.\r\nI sat up irritably and nursed the wound, which was bleeding a little.\r\nStill drowsy, I felt more cautiously for what I supposed had been my\r\nscarf pin, but there was nothing there. Wide awake now, I reached for\r\nmy traveling-bag, on the chance that I had put my watch in there. I had\r\ndrawn the satchel to me and had my hand on the lock before I realized\r\nthat it was not my own!\r\n\r\nMine was of alligator hide. I had killed the beast in Florida, after the\r\nexpenditure of enough money to have bought a house and enough energy to\r\nhave built one. The bag I held in my hand was a black one, sealskin, I\r\nthink. The staggering thought of what the loss of my bag meant to me put\r\nmy finger on the bell and kept it there until the porter came.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you ring, sir?\u201d he asked, poking his head through the curtains\r\nobsequiously. McKnight objects that nobody can poke his head through a\r\ncurtain and be obsequious. But Pullman porters can and do.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I snapped. \u201cIt rang itself. What in thunder do you mean by\r\nexchanging my valise for this one? You'll have to find it if you waken\r\nthe entire car to do it. There are important papers in that grip.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPorter,\u201d called a feminine voice from an upper berth near-by. \u201cPorter,\r\nam I to dangle here all day?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet her dangle,\u201d I said savagely. \u201cYou find that bag of mine.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe porter frowned. Then he looked at me with injured dignity. \u201cI\r\nbrought in your overcoat, sir. You carried your own valise.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe fellow was right! In an excess of caution I had refused to\r\nrelinquish my alligator bag, and had turned over my other traps to the\r\nporter. It was clear enough then. I was simply a victim of the usual\r\nsleeping-car robbery. I was in a lather of perspiration by that time:\r\nthe lady down the car was still dangling and talking about it: still\r\nnearer a feminine voice was giving quick orders in French, presumably to\r\na maid. The porter was on his knees, looking under the berth.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot there, sir,\u201d he said, dusting his knees. He was visibly more\r\ncheerful, having been absolved of responsibility. \u201cReckon it was taken\r\nwhile you was wanderin' around the car last night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI'll give you fifty dollars if you find it,\u201d I said. \u201cA hundred. Reach\r\nup my shoes and I'll--\u201d\r\n\r\nI stopped abruptly. My eyes were fixed in stupefied amazement on a\r\ncoat that hung from a hook at the foot of my berth. From the coat they\r\ntraveled, dazed, to the soft-bosomed shirt beside it, and from there to\r\nthe collar and cravat in the net hammock across the windows.\r\n\r\n\u201cA hundred!\u201d the porter repeated, showing his teeth. But I caught him by\r\nthe arm and pointed to the foot of the berth.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat--what color's that coat?\u201d I asked unsteadily.\r\n\r\n\u201cGray, sir.\u201d His tone was one of gentle reproof.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd--the trousers?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe reached over and held up one creased leg. \u201cGray, too,\u201d he grinned.\r\n\r\n\u201cGray!\u201d I could not believe even his corroboration of my own eyes.\r\n\u201cBut my clothes were blue!\u201d The porter was amused: he dived under the\r\ncurtains and brought up a pair of shoes. \u201cYour shoes, sir,\u201d he said with\r\na flourish. \u201cReckon you've been dreaming, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow, there are two things I always avoid in my dress--possibly an\r\nidiosyncrasy of my bachelor existence. These tabooed articles are red\r\nneckties and tan shoes. And not only were the shoes the porter lifted\r\nfrom the floor of a gorgeous shade of yellow, but the scarf which was\r\nrun through the turned over collar was a gaudy red. It took a full\r\nminute for the real import of things to penetrate my dazed intelligence.\r\nThen I gave a vindictive kick at the offending ensemble.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey're not mine, any of them,\u201d I snarled. \u201cThey are some other\r\nfellow's. I'll sit here until I take root before I put them on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey're nice lookin' clothes,\u201d the porter put in, eying the red tie\r\nwith appreciation. \u201cAin't everybody would have left you anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCall the conductor,\u201d I said shortly. Then a possible explanation\r\noccurred to me. \u201cOh, porter--what's the number of this berth?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSeven, sir. If you cain't wear those shoes--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSeven!\u201d In my relief I almost shouted it. \u201cWhy, then, it's simple\r\nenough. I'm in the wrong berth, that's all. My berth is nine.\r\nOnly--where the deuce is the man who belongs here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLikely in nine, sir.\u201d The darky was enjoying himself. \u201cYou and the\r\nother gentleman just got mixed in the night. That's all, sir.\u201d It was\r\nclear that he thought I had been drinking.\r\n\r\nI drew a long breath. Of course, that was the explanation. This was\r\nnumber seven's berth, that was his soft hat, this his umbrella, his\r\ncoat, his bag. My rage turned to irritation at myself.\r\n\r\nThe porter went to the next berth and I could hear his softly\r\ninsinuating voice. \u201cTime to get up, sir. Are you awake? Time to get up.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was no response from number nine. I guessed that he had opened the\r\ncurtains and was looking in. Then he came back.\r\n\r\n\u201cNumber nine's empty,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cEmpty! Do you mean my clothes aren't there?\u201d I demanded. \u201cMy valise?\r\nWhy don't you answer me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou doan' give me time,\u201d he retorted. \u201cThere ain't nothin' there. But\r\nit's been slept in.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe disappointment was the greater for my few moments of hope. I sat\r\nup in a white fury and put on the clothes that had been left me. Then,\r\nstill raging, I sat on the edge of the berth and put on the obnoxious\r\ntan shoes. The porter, called to his duties, made little excursions back\r\nto me, to offer assistance and to chuckle at my discomfiture. He stood\r\nby, outwardly decorous, but with little irritating grins of amusement\r\naround his mouth, when I finally emerged with the red tie in my hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cBet the owner of those clothes didn't become them any more than you\r\ndo,\u201d he said, as he plied the ubiquitous whisk broom.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I get the owner of these clothes,\u201d I retorted grimly, \u201che will\r\nneed a shroud. Where's the conductor?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe conductor was coming, he assured me; also that there was no bag\r\nanswering the description of mine on the car. I slammed my way to the\r\ndressing-room, washed, choked my fifteen and a half neck into a fifteen\r\ncollar, and was back again in less than five minutes. The car, as well\r\nas its occupants, was gradually taking on a daylight appearance. I\r\nhobbled in, for one of the shoes was abominably tight, and found myself\r\nfacing a young woman in blue with an unforgettable face. (\u201cThree women\r\nalready.\u201d McKnight says: \u201cThat's going some, even if you don't count\r\nthe Gilmore nurse.\u201d) She stood, half-turned toward me, one hand idly\r\ndrooping, the other steadying her as she gazed out at the flying\r\nlandscape. I had an instant impression that I had met her somewhere,\r\nunder different circumstances, more cheerful ones, I thought, for the\r\ngirl's dejection now was evident. Beside her, sitting down, a small dark\r\nwoman, considerably older, was talking in a rapid undertone. The girl\r\nnodded indifferently now and then. I fancied, although I was not sure,\r\nthat my appearance brought a startled look into the young woman's face.\r\nI sat down and, hands thrust deep into the other man's pockets, stared\r\nruefully at the other man's shoes.\r\n\r\nThe stage was set. In a moment the curtain was going up on the first act\r\nof the play. And for a while we would all say our little speeches and\r\nsing our little songs, and I, the villain, would hold center stage while\r\nthe gallery hissed.\r\n\r\nThe porter was standing beside lower ten. He had reached in and was\r\nknocking valiantly. But his efforts met with no response. He winked at\r\nme over his shoulder; then he unfastened the curtains and bent forward.\r\nBehind him, I saw him stiffen, heard his muttered exclamation, saw the\r\nbluish pallor that spread over his face and neck. As he retreated a step\r\nthe interior of lower ten lay open to the day.\r\n\r\nThe man in it was on his back, the early morning sun striking full on\r\nhis upturned face. But the light did not disturb him. A small stain of\r\nred dyed the front of his night clothes and trailed across the sheet;\r\nhis half-open eyes were fixed, without seeing, on the shining wood\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nI grasped the porter's shaking shoulders and stared down to where the\r\ntrain imparted to the body a grisly suggestion of motion. \u201cGood Lord,\u201d I\r\ngasped. \u201cThe man's been murdered!\u201d\r\n\nAfterwards, when I tried to recall our discovery of the body in lower\r\nten, I found that my most vivid impression was not that made by the\r\nrevelation of the opened curtain. I had an instantaneous picture of a\r\nslender blue-gowned girl who seemed to sense my words rather than hear\r\nthem, of two small hands that clutched desperately at the seat beside\r\nthem. The girl in the aisle stood, bent toward us, perplexity and alarm\r\nfighting in her face.\r\n\r\nWith twitching hands the porter attempted to draw the curtains together.\r\nThen in a paralysis of shock, he collapsed on the edge of my berth and\r\nsat there swaying. In my excitement I shook him.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor Heaven's sake, keep your nerve, man,\u201d I said bruskly. \u201cYou'll have\r\nevery woman in the car in hysterics. And if you do, you'll wish you\r\ncould change places with the man in there.\u201d He rolled his eyes.\r\n\r\nA man near, who had been reading last night's paper, dropped it quickly\r\nand tiptoed toward us. He peered between the partly open curtains,\r\nclosed them quietly and went back, ostentatiously solemn, to his seat.\r\nThe very crackle with which he opened his paper added to the bursting\r\ncuriosity of the car. For the passengers knew that something was amiss:\r\nI was conscious of a sudden tension.\r\n\r\nWith the curtains closed the porter was more himself; he wiped his lips\r\nwith a handkerchief and stood erect.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's my last trip in this car,\u201d he remarked heavily. \u201cThere's something\r\nwrong with that berth. Last trip the woman in it took an overdose of\r\nsome sleeping stuff, and we found her, jes' like that, dead! And it\r\nain't more'n three months now since there was twins born in that very\r\nspot. No, sir, it ain't natural.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt that moment a thin man with prominent eyes and a spare grayish goatee\r\ncreaked up the aisle and paused beside me.\r\n\r\n\u201cPorter sick?\u201d he inquired, taking in with a professional eye the\r\nporter's horror-struck face, my own excitement and the slightly gaping\r\ncurtains of lower ten. He reached for the darky's pulse and pulled out\r\nan old-fashioned gold watch.\r\n\r\n\u201cHm! Only fifty! What's the matter? Had a shock?\u201d he asked shrewdly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answered for the porter. \u201cWe've both had one. If you are a\r\ndoctor, I wish you would look at the man in the berth across, lower ten.\r\nI'm afraid it's too late, but I'm not experienced in such matters.\u201d\r\n\r\nTogether we opened the curtains, and the doctor, bending down, gave a\r\ncomprehensive glance that took in the rolling head, the relaxed jaw, the\r\nugly stain on the sheet. The examination needed only a moment. Death\r\nwas written in the clear white of the nostrils, the colorless lips, the\r\nsmoothing away of the sinister lines of the night before. With its new\r\ndignity the face was not unhandsome: the gray hair was still plentiful,\r\nthe features strong and well cut.\r\n\r\nThe doctor straightened himself and turned to me. \u201cDead for some time,\u201d\r\n he said, running a professional finger over the stains. \u201cThese are dry\r\nand darkened, you see, and rigor mortis is well established. A friend of\r\nyours?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't know him at all,\u201d I replied. \u201cNever saw him but once before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you don't know if he is traveling alone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, he was not--that is, I don't know anything about him,\u201d I corrected\r\nmyself. It was my first blunder: the doctor glanced up at me quickly and\r\nthen turned his attention again to the body. Like a flash there had come\r\nto me the vision of the woman with the bronze hair and the tragic face,\r\nwhom I had surprised in the vestibule between the cars, somewhere in\r\nthe small hours of the morning. I had acted on my first impulse--the\r\nmasculine one of shielding a woman.\r\n\r\nThe doctor had unfastened the coat of the striped pajamas and exposed\r\nthe dead man's chest. On the left side was a small punctured wound of\r\ninsignificant size.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery neatly done,\u201d the doctor said with appreciation. \u201cCouldn't have\r\ndone it better myself. Right through the intercostal space: no time even\r\nto grunt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn't the heart around there somewhere?\u201d I asked. The medical man\r\nturned toward me and smiled austerely.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat's where it belongs, just under that puncture, when it isn't\r\ngadding around in a man's throat or his boots.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had a new respect for the doctor, for any one indeed who could\r\ncrack even a feeble joke under such circumstances, or who could run an\r\nimpersonal finger over that wound and those stains. Odd how a healthy,\r\nnormal man holds the medical profession in half contemptuous regard\r\nuntil he gets sick, or an emergency like this arises, and then turns\r\nmeekly to the man who knows the ins and outs of his mortal tenement,\r\ntakes his pills or his patronage, ties to him like a rudderless ship in\r\na gale.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuicide, is it, doctor?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\nHe stood erect, after drawing the bed-clothing over the face, and,\r\ntaking off his glasses, he wiped them slowly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it is not suicide,\u201d he announced decisively. \u201cIt is murder.\u201d\r\n\r\nOf course, I had expected that, but the word itself brought a shiver. I\r\nwas just a bit dizzy. Curious faces through the car were turned toward\r\nus, and I could hear the porter behind me breathing audibly. A stout\r\nwoman in negligee came down the aisle and querulously confronted the\r\nporter. She wore a pink dressing-jacket and carried portions of her\r\nclothing.\r\n\r\n\u201cPorter,\u201d she began, in the voice of the lady who had \u201cdangled,\u201d \u201cis\r\nthere a rule of this company that will allow a woman to occupy the\r\ndressing-room for one hour and curl her hair with an alcohol lamp while\r\nrespectable people haven't a place where they can hook their--\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stopped suddenly and stared into lower ten. Her shining pink cheeks\r\ngrew pasty, her jaw fell. I remember trying to think of something to\r\nsay, and of saying nothing at all. Then--she had buried her eyes in the\r\nnondescript garments that hung from her arm and tottered back the way\r\nshe had come. Slowly a little knot of men gathered around us, silent\r\nfor the most part. The doctor was making a search of the berth when the\r\nconductor elbowed his way through, followed by the inquisitive man, who\r\nhad evidently summoned him. I had lost sight, for a time, of the girl in\r\nblue.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo it himself?\u201d the conductor queried, after a businesslike glance at\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, he didn't,\u201d the doctor asserted. \u201cThere's no weapon here, and the\r\nwindow is closed. He couldn't have thrown it out, and he didn't swallow\r\nit. What on earth are you looking for, man?\u201d\r\n\r\nSome one was on the floor at our feet, face down, head peering under the\r\nberth. Now he got up without apology, revealing the man who had summoned\r\nthe conductor. He was dusty, alert, cheerful, and he dragged up with him\r\nthe dead man's suit-case. The sight of it brought back to me at once my\r\nown predicament.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't know whether there's any connection or not, conductor,\u201d I said,\r\n\u201cbut I am a victim, too, in less degree; I've been robbed of everything\r\nI possess, except a red and yellow bath-robe. I happened to be wearing\r\nthe bath-robe, which was probably the reason the thief overlooked it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a fresh murmur in the crowd. Some body laughed nervously. The\r\nconductor was irritated.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can't bother with that now,\u201d he snarled. \u201cThe railroad company is\r\nresponsible for transportation, not for clothes, jewelry and morals. If\r\npeople want to be stabbed and robbed in the company's cars, it's their\r\naffair. Why didn't you sleep in your clothes? I do.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took an angry step forward. Then somebody touched my arm, and I\r\nunclenched my fist. I could understand the conductor's position, and\r\nbeside, in the law, I had been guilty myself of contributory negligence.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm not trying to make you responsible,\u201d I protested as amiably as I\r\ncould, \u201cand I believe the clothes the thief left are as good as my own.\r\nThey are certainly newer. But my valise contained valuable papers and it\r\nis to your interest as well as mine to find the man who stole it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, of course,\u201d the conductor said shrewdly. \u201cFind the man who\r\nskipped out with this gentleman's clothes, and you've probably got the\r\nmurderer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI went to bed in lower nine,\u201d I said, my mind full again of my lost\r\npapers, \u201cand I wakened in number seven. I was up in the night prowling\r\naround, as I was unable to sleep, and I must have gone back to the wrong\r\nberth. Anyhow, until the porter wakened me this morning I knew nothing\r\nof my mistake. In the interval the thief--murderer, too, perhaps--must\r\nhave come back, discovered my error, and taken advantage of it to\r\nfurther his escape.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe inquisitive man looked at me from between narrowed eyelids,\r\nferret-like.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid any one on the train suspect you of having valuable papers?\u201d he\r\ninquired. The crowd was listening intently.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo one,\u201d I answered promptly and positively. The doctor was\r\ninvestigating the murdered man's effects. The pockets of his trousers\r\ncontained the usual miscellany of keys and small change, while in his\r\nhip pocket was found a small pearl-handled revolver of the type women\r\nusually keep around. A gold watch with a Masonic charm had slid down\r\nbetween the mattress and the window, while a showy diamond stud was\r\nstill fastened in the bosom of his shirt. Taken as a whole, the personal\r\nbelongings were those of a man of some means, but without any particular\r\ndegree of breeding. The doctor heaped them together.\r\n\r\n\u201cEither robbery was not the motive,\u201d he reflected, \u201cor the thief\r\noverlooked these things in his hurry.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe latter hypothesis seemed the more tenable, when, after a thorough\r\nsearch, we found no pocketbook and less than a dollar in small change.\r\n\r\nThe suit-case gave no clue. It contained one empty leather-covered flask\r\nand a pint bottle, also empty, a change of linen and some collars with\r\nthe laundry mark, S. H. In the leather tag on the handle was a card\r\nwith the name Simon Harrington, Pittsburg. The conductor sat down on my\r\nunmade berth, across, and made an entry of the name and address. Then,\r\non an old envelope, he wrote a few words and gave it to the porter, who\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess that's all I can do,\u201d he said. \u201cI've had enough trouble this\r\ntrip to last for a year. They don't need a conductor on these trains any\r\nmore; what they ought to have is a sheriff and a posse.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe porter from the next car came in and whispered to him. The conductor\r\nrose unhappily.\r\n\r\n\u201cNext car's caught the disease,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cDoctor, a woman back\r\nthere has got mumps or bubonic plague, or something. Will you come\r\nback?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe strange porter stood aside.\r\n\r\n\u201cLady about the middle of the car,\u201d he said, \u201cin black, sir, with\r\nqueer-looking hair--sort of copper color, I think, sir.\u201d\r\n\nWith the departure of the conductor and the doctor, the group around\r\nlower ten broke up, to re-form in smaller knots through the car. The\r\nporter remained on guard. With something of relief I sank into a seat.\r\nI wanted to think, to try to remember the details of the previous night.\r\nBut my inquisitive acquaintance had other intentions. He came up and sat\r\ndown beside me. Like the conductor, he had taken notes of the dead man's\r\nbelongings, his name, address, clothing and the general circumstances of\r\nthe crime. Now with his little note-book open before him, he prepared to\r\nenjoy the minor sensation of the robbery.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now for the second victim,\u201d he began cheerfully. \u201cWhat is your name\r\nand address, please?\u201d I eyed him with suspicion.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have lost everything but my name and address,\u201d I parried. \u201cWhat do\r\nyou want them for? Publication?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no; dear, no!\u201d he said, shocked at my misapprehension. \u201cMerely for\r\nmy own enlightenment. I like to gather data of this kind and draw my\r\nown conclusions. Most interesting and engrossing. Once or twice I have\r\nforestalled the results of police investigation--but entirely for my own\r\namusement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded tolerantly. Most of us have hobbies; I knew a man once who\r\ncarried his handkerchief up his sleeve and had a mania for old colored\r\nprints cut out of Godey's Lady's Book.\r\n\r\n\u201cI use that inductive method originated by Poe and followed since with\r\nsuch success by Conan Doyle. Have you ever read Gaboriau? Ah, you have\r\nmissed a treat, indeed. And now, to get down to business, what is the\r\nname of our escaped thief and probable murderer?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow on earth do I know?\u201d I demanded impatiently. \u201cHe didn't write it in\r\nblood anywhere, did he?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe little man looked hurt and disappointed.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean to say,\u201d he asked, \u201cthat the pockets of those clothes are\r\nentirely empty?\u201d The pockets! In the excitement I had forgotten entirely\r\nthe sealskin grip which the porter now sat at my feet, and I had not\r\ninvestigated the pockets at all. With the inquisitive man's pencil\r\ntaking note of everything that I found, I emptied them on the opposite\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nUpper left-hand waist-coat, two lead pencils and a fountain pen; lower\r\nright waist-coat, match-box and a small stamp book; right-hand pocket\r\ncoat, pair of gray suede gloves, new, size seven and a half; left-hand\r\npocket, gun-metal cigarette case studded with pearls, half-full of\r\nEgyptian cigarettes. The trousers pockets contained a gold penknife, a\r\nsmall amount of money in bills and change, and a handkerchief with the\r\ninitial \u201cS\u201d on it.\r\n\r\nFurther search through the coat discovered a card-case with cards\r\nbearing the name Henry Pinckney Sullivan, and a leather flask with\r\ngold mountings, filled with what seemed to be very fair whisky, and\r\nmonogrammed H. P. S.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis name evidently is Henry Pinckney Sullivan,\u201d said the cheerful\r\nfollower of Poe, as he wrote it down. \u201cAddress as yet unknown. Blond,\r\nprobably. Have you noticed that it is almost always the blond men who\r\naffect a very light gray, with a touch of red in the scarf? Fact, I\r\nassure you. I kept a record once of the summer attire of men, and ninety\r\nper cent, followed my rule. Dark men like you affect navy blue, or\r\nbrown.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself I was amused at the man's shrewdness.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; the suit he took was dark--a blue,\u201d I said. He rubbed his hands\r\nand smiled at me delightedly. \u201cThen you wore black shoes, not tan,\u201d he\r\nsaid, with a glance at the aggressive yellow ones I wore.\r\n\r\n\u201cRight again,\u201d I acknowledged. \u201cBlack low shoes and black embroidered\r\nhose. If you keep on you'll have a motive for the crime, and the\r\nmurderer's present place of hiding. And if you come back to the smoker\r\nwith me, I'll give you an opportunity to judge if he knew good whisky\r\nfrom bad.\u201d\r\n\r\nI put the articles from the pockets back again and got up. \u201cI wonder\r\nif there is a diner on?\u201d I said. \u201cI need something sustaining after all\r\nthis.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was conscious then of some one at my elbow. I turned to see the young\r\nwoman whose face was so vaguely familiar. In the very act of speaking\r\nshe drew back suddenly and colored.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh,--I beg your pardon,\u201d she said hurriedly, \u201cI--thought you were--some\r\none else.\u201d She was looking in a puzzled fashion at my coat. I felt all\r\nthe cringing guilt of a man who has accidentally picked up the wrong\r\numbrella: my borrowed collar sat tight on my neck.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm sorry,\u201d I said idiotically. \u201cI'm sorry, but--I'm not.\u201d I have\r\nlearned since that she has bright brown hair, with a loose wave in it\r\nthat drops over her ears, and dark blue eyes with black lashes and--but\r\nwhat does it matter? One enjoys a picture as a whole: not as the sum of\r\nits parts.\r\n\r\nShe saw the flask then, and her errand came back to her. \u201cOne of the\r\nladies at the end of car has fainted,\u201d she explained. \u201cI thought perhaps\r\na stimulant--\u201d\r\n\r\nI picked up the flask at once and followed my guide down the aisle. Two\r\nor three women were working over the woman who had fainted. They had\r\nopened her collar and taken out her hairpins, whatever good that might\r\ndo. The stout woman was vigorously rubbing her wrists, with the idea,\r\nno doubt, of working up her pulse! The unconscious woman was the one for\r\nwhom I had secured lower eleven at the station.\r\n\r\nI poured a little liquor in a bungling masculine fashion between her\r\nlips as she leaned back, with closed eyes. She choked, coughed, and\r\nrallied somewhat.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor thing,\u201d said the stout lady. \u201cAs she lies back that way I could\r\nalmost think it was my mother; she used to faint so much.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would make anybody faint,\u201d chimed in another. \u201cMurder and robbery in\r\none night and on one car. I'm thankful I always wear my rings in a bag\r\naround my neck--even if they do get under me and keep me awake.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl in blue was looking at us with wide, startled eyes. I saw her\r\npale a little, saw the quick, apprehensive glance which she threw at her\r\ntraveling companion, the small woman I had noticed before. There was an\r\nexchange--almost a clash--of glances. The small woman frowned. That was\r\nall. I turned my attention again to my patient.\r\n\r\nShe had revived somewhat, and now she asked to have the window opened.\r\nThe train had stopped again and the car was oppressively hot. People\r\naround were looking at their watches and grumbling over the delay.\r\nThe doctor bustled in with a remark about its being his busy day. The\r\namateur detective and the porter together mounted guard over lower ten.\r\nOutside the heat rose in shimmering waves from the tracks: the very wood\r\nof the car was hot to touch. A Camberwell Beauty darted through the open\r\ndoor and made its way, in erratic plunges, great wings waving, down the\r\nsunny aisle. All around lay the peace of harvested fields, the quiet of\r\nthe country.\r\n\nI was growing more and more irritable. The thought of what the loss of\r\nthe notes meant was fast crowding the murder to the back of my mind. The\r\nforced inaction was intolerable.\r\n\r\nThe porter had reported no bag answering the description of mine on the\r\ntrain, but I was disposed to make my own investigation. I made a tour\r\nof the cars, scrutinizing every variety of hand luggage, ranging from\r\nluxurious English bags with gold mountings to the wicker nondescripts of\r\nthe day coach at the rear. I was not alone in my quest, for the girl in\r\nblue was just ahead of me. Car by car she preceded me through the train,\r\nunconscious that I was behind her, looking at each passenger as she\r\npassed. I fancied the proceeding was distasteful, but that she had\r\ndetermined on a course and was carrying it through. We reached the end\r\nof the train almost together--empty-handed, both of us.\r\n\r\nThe girl went out to the platform. When she saw me she moved aside, and\r\nI stepped out beside her. Behind us the track curved sharply; the early\r\nsunshine threw the train, in long black shadow, over the hot earth.\r\nForward somewhere they were hammering. The girl said nothing, but her\r\nprofile was strained and anxious.\r\n\r\n\u201cI--if you have lost anything,\u201d I began, \u201cI wish you would let me try to\r\nhelp. Not that my own success is anything to boast of.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe hardly glanced at me. It was not flattering. \u201cI have not\r\nbeen robbed, if that is what you mean,\u201d she replied quietly. \u201cI\r\nam--perplexed. That is all.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to say to that. I lifted my hat--the other fellow's\r\nhat--and turned to go back to my car. Two or three members of the train\r\ncrew, including the conductor, were standing in the shadow talking.\r\nAnd at that moment, from a farm-house near came the swift clang of the\r\nbreakfast bell, calling in the hands from barn and pasture. I turned\r\nback to the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe may be here for an hour,\u201d I said, \u201cand there is no buffet car on. If\r\nI remember my youth, that bell means ham and eggs and country butter and\r\ncoffee. If you care to run the risk--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am not hungry,\u201d she said, \u201cbut perhaps a cup of coffee--dear me, I\r\nbelieve I am hungry,\u201d she finished. \u201cOnly--\u201d She glanced back of her.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can bring your companion,\u201d I suggested, without enthusiasm. But the\r\nyoung woman shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is not hungry,\u201d she objected, \u201cand she is very--well, I know she\r\nwouldn't come. Do you suppose we could make it if we run?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven't any idea,\u201d I said cheerfully. \u201cAny old train would be better\r\nthan this one, if it does leave us behind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Any train would be better than this one,\u201d she repeated gravely.\r\nI found myself watching her changing expression. I had spoken two dozen\r\nwords to her and already I felt that I knew the lights and shades in\r\nher voice,--I, who had always known how a woman rode to hounds, and who\r\nnever could have told the color of her hair.\r\n\r\nI stepped down on the ties and turned to assist her, and together we\r\nwalked back to where the conductor and the porter from our car were in\r\nclose conversation. Instinctively my hand went to my cigarette pocket\r\nand came out empty. She saw the gesture.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you want to smoke, you may,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a big cousin who\r\nsmokes all the time. He says I am 'kippered.'\u201d\r\n\r\nI drew out the gun-metal cigarette case and opened it. But this most\r\ncommonplace action had an extraordinary result: the girl beside me\r\nstopped dead still and stood staring at it with fascinated eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs--where did you get that?\u201d she demanded, with a catch in her voice;\r\nher gaze still fixed on the cigarette case.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you haven't heard the rest of the tragedy?\u201d I asked, holding out\r\nthe case. \u201cIt's frightfully bad luck for me, but it makes a good story.\r\nYou see--\u201d\r\n\r\nAt that moment the conductor and porter ceased their colloquy. The\r\nconductor came directly toward me, tugging as he came at his bristling\r\ngray mustache.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would like to talk to you in the car,\u201d he said to me, with a curious\r\nglance at the young lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan't it wait?\u201d I objected. \u201cWe are on our way to a cup of coffee and a\r\nslice of bacon. Be merciful, as you are powerful.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm afraid the breakfast will have to wait,\u201d he replied. \u201cI won't keep\r\nyou long.\u201d There was a note of authority in his voice which I resented;\r\nbut, after all, the circumstances were unusual.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe'll have to defer that cup of coffee for a while,\u201d I said to the\r\ngirl; \u201cbut don't despair; there's breakfast somewhere.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs we entered the car, she stood aside, but I felt rather than saw that\r\nshe followed us. I was surprised to see a half dozen men gathered around\r\nthe berth in which I had wakened, number seven. It had not yet been made\r\nup.\r\n\r\nAs we passed along the aisle, I was conscious of a new expression on the\r\nfaces of the passengers. The tall woman who had fainted was searching\r\nmy face with narrowed eyes, while the stout woman of the kindly heart\r\navoided my gaze, and pretended to look out the window.\r\n\r\nAs we pushed our way through the group, I fancied that it closed around\r\nme ominously. The conductor said nothing, but led the way without\r\nceremony to the side of the berth.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat's the matter?\u201d I inquired. I was puzzled, but not apprehensive.\r\n\u201cHave you some of my things? I'd be thankful even for my shoes; these\r\nare confoundedly tight.\u201d\r\n\r\nNobody spoke, and I fell silent, too. For one of the pillows had been\r\nturned over, and the under side of the white case was streaked with\r\nbrownish stains. I think it was a perceptible time before I realized\r\nthat the stains were blood, and that the faces around were filled with\r\nsuspicion and distrust.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it--that looks like blood,\u201d I said vacuously. There was an\r\nincessant pounding in my ears, and the conductor's voice came from far\r\noff.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is blood,\u201d he asserted grimly.\r\n\r\nI looked around with a dizzy attempt at nonchalance. \u201cEven if it is,\u201d\r\n I remonstrated, \u201csurely you don't suppose for a moment that I know\r\nanything about it!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe amateur detective elbowed his way in. He had a scrap of transparent\r\npaper in his hand, and a pencil.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would like permission to trace the stains,\u201d he began eagerly.\r\n\u201cAlso\u201d--to me--\u201cif you will kindly jab your finger with a\r\npin--needle--anything--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you don't keep out of this,\u201d the conductor said savagely, \u201cI will\r\ndo some jabbing myself. As for you, sir--\u201d he turned to me. I was\r\nabsolutely innocent, but I knew that I presented a typical picture of\r\nguilt; I was covered with cold sweat, and the pounding in my ears kept\r\nup dizzily. \u201cAs for you, sir--\u201d\r\n\r\nThe irrepressible amateur detective made a quick pounce at the pillow\r\nand pushed back the cover. Before our incredulous eyes he drew out a\r\nnarrow steel dirk which had been buried to the small cross that served\r\nas a head.\r\n\r\nThere was a chorus of voices around, a quick surging forward of the\r\ncrowd. So that was what had scratched my hand! I buried the wound in my\r\ncoat pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, trying to speak naturally, \u201cdoesn't that prove what I\r\nhave been telling you? The man who committed the murder belonged to this\r\nberth, and made an exchange in some way after the crime. How do you know\r\nhe didn't change the tags so I would come back to this berth?\u201d This was\r\nan inspiration; I was pleased with it. \u201cThat's what he did, he changed\r\nthe tags,\u201d I reiterated.\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur of assent around. The doctor, who was standing beside\r\nme, put his hand on my arm. \u201cIf this gentleman committed this crime, and\r\nI for one feel sure he did not, then who is the fellow who got away? And\r\nwhy did he go?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have only one man's word for that,\u201d the conductor snarled. \u201cI've\r\ntraveled some in these cars myself, and no one ever changed berths with\r\nme.\u201d\r\n\r\nSomebody on the edge of the group asserted that hereafter he would\r\ntravel by daylight. I glanced up and caught the eye of the girl in blue.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are all mad,\u201d she said. Her tone was low, but I heard her\r\ndistinctly. \u201cDon't take them seriously enough to defend yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am glad you think I didn't do it,\u201d I observed meekly, over the crowd.\r\n\u201cNothing else is of any importance.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe conductor had pulled out his note-book again. \u201cYour name, please,\u201d\r\n he said gruffly.\r\n\r\n\u201cLawrence Blakeley, Washington.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour occupation?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAttorney. A member of the firm of Blakeley and McKnight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Blakeley, you say you have occupied the wrong berth and have been\r\nrobbed. Do you know anything of the man who did it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly from what he left behind,\u201d I answered. \u201cThese clothes--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey fit you,\u201d he said with quick suspicion. \u201cIsn't that rather a\r\ncoincidence? You are a large man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood Heavens,\u201d I retorted, stung into fury, \u201cdo I look like a man who\r\nwould wear this kind of a necktie? Do you suppose I carry purple and\r\ngreen barred silk handkerchiefs? Would any man in his senses wear a pair\r\nof shoes a full size too small?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe conductor was inclined to hedge. \u201cYou will have to grant that I\r\nam in a peculiar position,\u201d he said. \u201cI have only your word as to the\r\nexchange of berths, and you understand I am merely doing my duty. Are\r\nthere any clues in the pockets?\u201d\r\n\r\nFor the second time I emptied them of their contents, which he noted.\r\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d he finished. \u201cThere was nothing else?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat's not all, sir,\u201d broke in the porter, stepping forward. \u201cThere was\r\na small black satchel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat's so,\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cI forgot the bag. I don't even know where it\r\nis.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe easily swayed crowd looked suspicious again. I've grown so\r\naccustomed to reading the faces of a jury, seeing them swing from\r\ndoubt to belief, and back again to doubt, that I instinctively watch\r\nexpressions. I saw that my forgetfulness had done me harm--that\r\nsuspicion was roused again.\r\n\r\nThe bag was found a couple of seats away, under somebody's\r\nraincoat--another dubious circumstance. Was I hiding it? It was brought\r\nto the berth and placed beside the conductor, who opened it at once.\r\n\r\nIt contained the usual traveling impedimenta--change of linen, collars,\r\nhandkerchiefs, a bronze-green scarf, and a safety razor. But the\r\nattention of the crowd riveted itself on a flat, Russia leather wallet,\r\naround which a heavy gum band was wrapped, and which bore in gilt\r\nletters the name \u201cSimon Harrington.\u201d\r\n\nThe conductor held it out to me, his face sternly accusing.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs this another coincidence?\u201d he asked. \u201cDid the man who left you his\r\nclothes and the barred silk handkerchief and the tight shoes leave you\r\nthe spoil of the murder?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe men standing around had drawn off a little, and I saw the absolute\r\nfutility of any remonstrance. Have you ever seen a fly, who, in these\r\nhygienic days, finding no cobwebs to entangle him, is caught in a sheet\r\nof fly paper, finds himself more and more mired, and is finally quiet\r\nwith the sticky stillness of despair?\r\n\r\nWell, I was the fly. I had seen too much of circumstantial evidence to\r\nhave any belief that the establishing of my identity would weigh much\r\nagainst the other incriminating details. It meant imprisonment and\r\ntrial, probably, with all the notoriety and loss of practice they would\r\nentail. A man thinks quickly at a time like that. All the probable\r\nconsequences of the finding of that pocket-book flashed through my mind\r\nas I extended my hand to take it. Then I drew my arm back.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't want it,\u201d I said. \u201cLook inside. Maybe the other man took the\r\nmoney and left the wallet.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe conductor opened it, and again there was a curious surging forward\r\nof the crowd. To my intense disappointment the money was still there.\r\n\r\nI stood blankly miserable while it was counted out--five\r\none-hundred-dollar bills, six twenties, and some fives and ones that\r\nbrought the total to six hundred and fifty dollars.\r\n\r\nThe little man with the note-book insisted on taking the numbers of\r\nthe notes, to the conductor's annoyance. It was immaterial to me: small\r\nthings had lost their power to irritate. I was seeing myself in the\r\nprisoner's box, going through all the nerve-racking routine of a trial\r\nfor murder--the challenging of the jury, the endless cross-examinations,\r\nthe alternate hope and fear. I believe I said before that I had no\r\nnerves, but for a few minutes that morning I was as near as a man ever\r\ncomes to hysteria.\r\n\r\nI folded my arms and gave myself a mental shake. I seemed to be the\r\ncenter of a hundred eyes, expressing every shade of doubt and distrust,\r\nbut I tried not to flinch. Then some one created a diversion.\r\n\r\nThe amateur detective was busy again with the seal-skin bag,\r\ninvestigating the make of the safety razor and the manufacturer's name\r\non the bronze-green tie. Now, however, he paused and frowned, as though\r\nsome pet theory had been upset.\r\n\r\nThen from a corner of the bag he drew out and held up for our inspection\r\nsome three inches of fine gold chain, one end of which was blackened and\r\nstained with blood!\r\n\r\nThe conductor held out his hand for it, but the little man was not ready\r\nto give it up. He turned to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou say no watch was left you? Was there a piece of chain like that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo chain at all,\u201d I said sulkily. \u201cNo jewelry of any kind, except plain\r\ngold buttons in the shirt I am wearing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere are your glasses?\u201d he threw at me suddenly: instinctively my hand\r\nwent to my eyes. My glasses had been gone all morning, and I had not\r\neven noticed their absence. The little man smiled cynically and held out\r\nthe chain.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must ask you to examine this,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIsn't it a part of the\r\nfine gold chain you wear over your ear?\u201d\r\n\r\nI didn't want to touch the thing: the stain at the end made me shudder.\r\nBut with a baker's dozen of suspicious eyes--well, we'll say fourteen:\r\nthere were no one-eyed men--I took the fragment in the tips of my\r\nfingers and looked at it helplessly.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery fine chains are much alike,\u201d I managed to say. \u201cFor all I know,\r\nthis may be mine, but I don't know how it got into that sealskin bag. I\r\nnever saw the bag until this morning after daylight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe admits that he had the bag,\u201d somebody said behind me. \u201cHow did you\r\nguess that he wore glasses, anyhow?\u201d to the amateur sleuth.\r\n\r\nThat gentleman cleared his throat. \u201cThere were two reasons,\u201d he said,\r\n\u201cfor suspecting it. When you see a man with the lines of his face\r\ndrooping, a healthy individual with a pensive eye,--suspect astigmatism.\r\nBesides, this gentleman has a pronounced line across the bridge of his\r\nnose and a mark on his ear from the chain.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter this remarkable exhibition of the theoretical as combined with the\r\npractical, he sank into a seat near-by, and still holding the chain, sat\r\nwith closed eyes and pursed lips. It was evident to all the car that the\r\nsolution of the mystery was a question of moments. Once he bent forward\r\neagerly and putting the chain on the window-sill, proceeded to go\r\nover it with a pocket magnifying glass, only to shake his head in\r\ndisappointment. All the people around shook their heads too, although\r\nthey had not the slightest idea what it was about.\r\n\r\nThe pounding in my ears began again. The group around me seemed to be\r\nsuddenly motionless in the very act of moving, as if a hypnotist had\r\ncalled \u201cRigid!\u201d The girl in blue was looking at me, and above the din\r\nI thought she said she must speak to me--something vital. The pounding\r\ngrew louder and merged into a scream. With a grinding and splintering\r\nthe car rose under my feet. Then it fell away into darkness.\r\n\nHave you ever been picked up out of your three-meals-a-day life, whirled\r\naround in a tornado of events, and landed in a situation so grotesque\r\nand yet so horrible that you laugh even while you are groaning, and\r\nstraining at its hopelessness? McKnight says that is hysteria, and that\r\nno man worthy of the name ever admits to it.\r\n\r\nAlso, as McKnight says, it sounds like a tank drama. Just as the\r\nrevolving saw is about to cut the hero into stove lengths, the second\r\nvillain blows up the sawmill. The hero goes up through the roof and\r\nalights on the bank of a stream at the feet of his lady love, who is\r\nmaking daisy chains.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when I was safely home again, with Mrs. Klopton brewing\r\nstrange drinks that came in paper packets from the pharmacy, and that\r\nsmelled to heaven, I remember staggering to the door and closing it, and\r\nthen going back to bed and howling out the absurdity and the madness of\r\nthe whole thing. And while I laughed my very soul was sick, for the\r\ngirl was gone by that time, and I knew by all the loyalty that answers\r\nbetween men for honor that I would have to put her out of my mind.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, all the night that followed, filled as it was with the\r\nshrieking demons of pain, I saw her as I had seen her last, in the queer\r\nhat with green ribbons. I told the doctor this, guardedly, the next\r\nmorning, and he said it was the morphia, and that I was lucky not to\r\nhave seen a row of devils with green tails.\r\n\r\nI don't know anything about the wreck of September ninth last. You who\r\nswallowed the details with your coffee and digested the horrors with\r\nyour chop, probably know a great deal more than I do. I remember very\r\ndistinctly that the jumping and throbbing in my arm brought me back to a\r\nworld that at first was nothing but sky, a heap of clouds that I thought\r\nhazily were the meringue on a blue charlotte russe. As the sense of\r\nhearing was slowly added to vision, I heard a woman near me sobbing that\r\nshe had lost her hat pin, and she couldn't keep her hat on.\r\n\r\nI think I dropped back into unconsciousness again, for the next thing\r\nI remember was of my blue patch of sky clouded with smoke, of a strange\r\nroaring and crackling, of a rain of fiery sparks on my face and of\r\nsomebody beating at me with feeble hands. I opened my eyes and\r\nclosed them again: the girl in blue was bending over me. With that\r\nimperviousness to big things and keenness to small that is the first\r\neffect of shock, I tried to be facetious, when a spark stung my cheek.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will have to rouse yourself!\u201d the girl was repeating desperately.\r\n\u201cYou've been on fire twice already.\u201d A piece of striped ticking floated\r\nslowly over my head. As the wind caught it its charring edges leaped\r\ninto flame.\r\n\r\n\u201cLooks like a kite, doesn't it?\u201d I remarked cheerfully. And then, as my\r\narm gave an excruciating throb--\u201cJove, how my arm hurts!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl bent over and spoke slowly, distinctly, as one might speak to a\r\ndeaf person or a child.\r\n\r\n\u201cListen, Mr. Blakeley,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cYou must rouse yourself.\r\nThere has been a terrible accident. The second section ran into us. The\r\nwreck is burning now, and if we don't move, we will catch fire. Do you\r\nhear?\u201d\r\n\r\nHer voice and my arm were bringing me to my senses. \u201cI hear,\u201d I said.\r\n\u201cI--I'll sit up in a second. Are you hurt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, only bruised. Do you think you can walk?\u201d\r\n\r\nI drew up one foot after another, gingerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey seem to move all right,\u201d I remarked dubiously. \u201cWould you mind\r\ntelling me where the back of my head has gone? I can't help thinking it\r\nisn't there.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe made a quick examination. \u201cIt's pretty badly bumped,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\r\nmust have fallen on it.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had got up on my uninjured elbow by that time, but the pain threw me\r\nback. \u201cDon't look at the wreck,\u201d I entreated her. \u201cIt's no sight for a\r\nwoman. If--if there is any way to tie up this arm, I might be able to do\r\nsomething. There may be people under those cars!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen it is too late to help,\u201d she replied solemnly. A little shower of\r\nfeathers, each carrying its fiery lamp, blew over us from some burning\r\npillow. A part the wreck collapsed with a crash. In a resolute to play\r\na man's part in the tragedy going on around, I got to my knees. Then I\r\nrealized what had not noticed before: the hand and wrist of the broken\r\nleft arm were jammed through the handle of the sealskin grip. I gasped\r\nand sat down suddenly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must not do that,\u201d the girl insisted. I noticed now that she\r\nkept her back to the wreck, her eyes averted. \u201cThe weight of the\r\ntraveling-bag must be agony. Let me support the valise until we get back\r\na few yards. Then you must lie down until we can get it cut off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill it have to be cut off?\u201d I asked as calmly as possible. There were\r\nred-hot stabs of agony clear to my neck, but we were moving slowly away\r\nfrom the track.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she replied, with dumfounding coolness. \u201cIf I had a knife I could\r\ndo it myself. You might sit here and lean against this fence.\u201d\r\n\r\nBy that time my returning faculties had realized that she was going to\r\ncut off the satchel, not the arm. The dizziness was leaving and I was\r\ngradually becoming myself.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you pull, it might come,\u201d I suggested. \u201cAnd with that weight gone, I\r\nthink I will cease to be five feet eleven inches of baby.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe tried gently to loosen the handle, but it would not move, and at\r\nlast, with great drops of cold perspiration over me, I had to give up.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm afraid I can't stand it,\u201d I said. \u201cBut there's a knife somewhere\r\naround these clothes, and if I can find it, perhaps you can cut the\r\nleather.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs I gave her the knife she turned it over, examining it with a peculiar\r\nexpression, bewilderment rather than surprise. But she said nothing. She\r\nset to work deftly, and in a few minutes the bag dropped free.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat's better,\u201d I declared, sitting up. \u201cNow, if you can pin my sleeve\r\nto my coat, it will support the arm so we can get away from here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe pin might give,\u201d she objected, \u201cand the jerk would be terrible.\u201d\r\n She looked around, puzzled; then she got up, coming back in a minute\r\nwith a draggled, partly scorched sheet. This she tore into a large\r\nsquare, and after she had folded it, she slipped it under the broken arm\r\nand tied it securely at the back of my neck.\r\n\r\nThe relief was immediate, and, picking up the sealskin bag, I walked\r\nslowly beside her, away from the track.\r\n\r\nThe first act was over: the curtain fallen. The scene was \u201cstruck.\u201d\r\n\nWe were still dazed, I think, for we wandered like two troubled\r\nchildren, our one idea at first to get as far away as we could from the\r\nhorror behind us. We were both bareheaded, grimy, pallid through the\r\ngrit. Now and then we met little groups of country folk hurrying to the\r\ntrack: they stared at us curiously, and some wished to question us.\r\nBut we hurried past them; we had put the wreck behind us. That way lay\r\nmadness.\r\n\r\nOnly once the girl turned and looked behind her. The wreck was\r\nhidden, but the smoke cloud hung heavy and dense. For the first time I\r\nremembered that my companion had not been alone on the train.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is quiet here,\u201d I suggested. \u201cIf you will sit down on the bank I\r\nwill go back and make some inquiries. I've been criminally thoughtless.\r\nYour traveling companion--\u201d\r\n\r\nShe interrupted me, and something of her splendid poise was gone.\r\n\u201cPlease don't go back,\u201d she said. \u201cI am afraid it would be of no use.\r\nAnd I don't want to be left alone.\u201d\r\n\r\nHeaven knows I did not want her to be alone. I was more than content to\r\nwalk along beside her aimlessly, for any length of time. Gradually, as\r\nshe lost the exaltation of the moment, I was gaining my normal condition\r\nof mind. I was beginning to realize that I had lacked the morning grace\r\nof a shave, that I looked like some lost hope of yesterday, and that\r\nmy left shoe pinched outrageously. A man does not rise triumphant above\r\nsuch handicaps. The girl, for all her disordered hair and the crumpled\r\nlinen of her waist, in spite of her missing hat and the small gold bag\r\nthat hung forlornly from a broken chain, looked exceedingly lovely.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I won't leave you alone,\u201d I said manfully, and we stumbled on\r\ntogether. Thus far we had seen nobody from the wreck, but well up the\r\nlane we came across the tall dark woman who had occupied lower eleven.\r\nShe was half crouching beside the road, her black hair about her\r\nshoulders, and an ugly bruise over her eye. She did not seem to know\r\nus, and refused to accompany us. We left her there at last, babbling\r\nincoherently and rolling in her hands a dozen pebbles she had gathered\r\nin the road.\r\n\r\nThe girl shuddered as we went on. Once she turned and glanced at my\r\nbandage. \u201cDoes it hurt very much?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's growing rather numb. But it might be worse,\u201d I answered\r\nmendaciously. If anything in this world could be worse, I had never\r\nexperienced it.\r\n\r\nAnd so we trudged on bareheaded under the summer sun, growing parched\r\nand dusty and weary, doggedly leaving behind us the pillar of smoke.\r\nI thought I knew of a trolley line somewhere in the direction we\r\nwere going, or perhaps we could find a horse and trap to take us into\r\nBaltimore. The girl smiled when I suggested it.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will create a sensation, won't we?\u201d she asked. \u201cIsn't it queer--or\r\nperhaps it's my state of mind--but I keep wishing for a pair of gloves,\r\nwhen I haven't even a hat!\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the main road we sat down for a moment, and her hair,\r\nwhich had been coming loose for some time, fell over her shoulders in\r\nlittle waves that were most alluring. It seemed a pity to twist it\r\nup again, but when I suggested this, cautiously, she said it was\r\ntroublesome and got in her eyes when it was loose. So she gathered it\r\nup, while I held a row of little shell combs and pins, and when it was\r\ndone it was vastly becoming, too. Funny about hair: a man never knows\r\nhe has it until he begins to lose it, but it's different with a girl.\r\nSomething of the unconventional situation began to dawn on her as she\r\nput in the last hair-pin and patted some stray locks to place.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have not told you my name,\u201d she said abruptly. \u201cI forgot that because\r\nI know who you are, you know nothing about me. I am Alison West, and my\r\nhome is in Richmond.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo that was it! This was the girl of the photograph on John Gilmore's\r\nbedside table. The girl McKnight expected to see in Richmond the next\r\nday, Sunday! She was on her way back to meet him! Well, what difference\r\ndid it make, anyhow? We had been thrown together by the merest chance.\r\nIn an hour or two at the most we would be back in civilization and she\r\nwould recall me, if she remembered me at all, as an unshaven creature in\r\na red cravat and tan shoes, with a soiled Pullman sheet tied around my\r\nneck. I drew a deep breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust a twinge,\u201d I said, when she glanced up quickly. \u201cIt's very good\r\nof you to let me know, Miss West. I have been hearing delightful things\r\nabout you for three months.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom Richey McKnight?\u201d She was frankly curious.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. From Richey McKnight,\u201d I assented. Was it any wonder McKnight was\r\ncrazy about her? I dug my heels into the dust.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been visiting near Cresson, in the mountains,\u201d Miss West was\r\nsaying. \u201cThe person you mentioned, Mrs. Curtis, was my hostess. We--we\r\nwere on our way to Washington together.\u201d She spoke slowly, as if she\r\nwished to give the minimum of explanation. Across her face had come\r\nagain the baffling expression of perplexity and trouble I had seen\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were on your way home, I suppose? Richey spoke about seeing you,\u201d I\r\nfloundered, finding it necessary to say something. She looked at me with\r\nlevel, direct eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she returned quietly. \u201cI did not intend to go home. I--well, it\r\ndoesn't matter; I am going home now.\u201d\r\n\r\nA woman in a calico dress, with two children, each an exact duplicate of\r\nthe other, had come quickly down the road. She took in the situation at\r\na glance, and was explosively hospitable.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou poor things,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you'll take the first road to the left\r\nover there, and turn in at the second pigsty, you will find breakfast on\r\nthe table and a coffee-pot on the stove. And there's plenty of soap and\r\nwater, too. Don't say one word. There isn't a soul there to see you.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe accepted the invitation and she hurried on toward the excitement and\r\nthe railroad. I got up carefully and helped Miss West to her feet.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the second pigsty to the left,\u201d I repeated, \u201cwe will find the\r\nbreakfast I promised you seven eternities ago. Forward to the pigsty!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe said very little for the remainder of that walk. I had almost reached\r\nthe limit of endurance: with every step the broken ends of the bone\r\ngrated together. We found the farm-house without difficulty, and I\r\nremember wondering if I could hold out to the end of the old stone walk\r\nthat led between hedges to the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cAllah be praised,\u201d I said with all the voice I could muster. \u201cBehold\r\nthe coffee-pot!\u201d And then I put down the grip and folded up like a\r\njack-knife on the porch floor.\r\n\r\nWhen I came around something hot was trickling down my neck, and a\r\ndespairing voice was saying, \u201cOh, I don't seem to be able to pour it\r\ninto your mouth. Please open your eyes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I don't want it in my eyes,\u201d I replied dreamily. \u201cI haven't any\r\nidea what came over me. It was the shoes, I think: the left one is a\r\nred-hot torture.\u201d I was sitting by that time and looking across into her\r\nface.\r\n\r\nNever before or since have I fainted, but I would do it joyfully, a\r\ndozen times a day, if I could waken again to the blissful touch of soft\r\nfingers on my face, the hot ecstasy of coffee spilled by those fingers\r\ndown my neck. There was a thrill in every tone of her voice that\r\nmorning. Before long my loyalty to McKnight would step between me and\r\nthe girl he loved: life would develop new complexities. In those early\r\nhours after the wreck, full of pain as they were, there was nothing\r\nof the suspicion and distrust that came later. Shorn of our gauds and\r\nbaubles, we were primitive man and woman, together: our world for the\r\nhour was the deserted farm-house, the slope of wheat-field that led to\r\nthe road, the woodland lot, the pasture.\r\n\r\nWe breakfasted together across the homely table. Our cheerfulness, at\r\nfirst sheer reaction, became less forced as we ate great slices of bread\r\nfrom the granny oven back of the house, and drank hot fluid that smelled\r\nlike coffee and tasted like nothing that I have ever swallowed. We found\r\ncream in stone jars, sunk deep in the chill water of the spring house.\r\nAnd there were eggs, great yellow-brown ones,--a basket of them.\r\n\r\nSo, like two children awakened from a nightmare, we chattered over\r\nour food: we hunted mutual friends, we laughed together at my feeble\r\nwitticisms, but we put the horror behind us resolutely. After all, it\r\nwas the hat with the green ribbons that brought back the strangeness of\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\nAll along I had had the impression that Alison West was deliberately\r\nputting out of her mind something that obtruded now and then. It brought\r\nwith it a return of the puzzled expression that I had surprised early in\r\nthe day, before the wreck. I caught it once, when, breakfast over, she\r\nwas tightening the sling that held the broken arm. I had prolonged the\r\nmorning meal as much as I could, but when the wooden clock with the pink\r\nroses on the dial pointed to half after ten, and the mother with the\r\nduplicate youngsters had not come back, Miss West made the move I had\r\ndreaded.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we are to get into Baltimore at all we must start,\u201d she said,\r\nrising. \u201cYou ought to see a doctor as soon as possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHush,\u201d I said warningly. \u201cDon't mention the arm, please; it is asleep\r\nnow. You may rouse it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I only had a hat,\u201d she reflected. \u201cIt wouldn't need to be much of\r\none, but--\u201d She gave a little cry and darted to the corner. \u201cLook,\u201d she\r\nsaid triumphantly, \u201cthe very thing. With the green streamers tied up in\r\na bow, like this--do you suppose the child would mind? I can put five\r\ndollars or so here--that would buy a dozen of them.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a queer affair of straw, that hat, with a round crown and a rim\r\nthat flopped dismally. With a single movement she had turned it up at\r\none side and fitted it to her head. Grotesque by itself, when she wore\r\nit it was a thing of joy.\r\n\r\nEvidently the lack of head covering had troubled her, for she was elated\r\nat her find. She left me, scrawling a note of thanks and pinning it\r\nwith a bill to the table-cloth, and ran up-stairs to the mirror and the\r\npromised soap and water.\r\n\r\nI did not see her when she came down. I had discovered a bench with\r\na tin basin outside the kitchen door, and was washing, in a helpless,\r\none-sided way. I felt rather than saw that she was standing in the\r\ndoor-way, and I made a final plunge into the basin.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow is it possible for a man with only a right hand to wash his left\r\near?\u201d I asked from the roller towel. I was distinctly uncomfortable: men\r\nare more rigidly creatures of convention than women, whether they admit\r\nit or not. \u201cThere is so much soap on me still that if I laugh I will\r\nblow bubbles. Washing with rain-water and home-made soap is like\r\nmotoring on a slippery road. I only struck the high places.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen, having achieved a brilliant polish with the towel, I looked at the\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\nShe was leaning against the frame of the door, her face perfectly\r\ncolorless, her breath coming in slow, difficult respirations. The\r\nerratic hat was pinned to place, but it had slid rakishly to one side.\r\nWhen I realized that she was staring, not at me, but past me to the road\r\nalong which we had come, I turned and followed her gaze. There was\r\nno one in sight: the lane stretched dust white in the sun,--no moving\r\nfigure on it, no sign of life.\r\n\nThe surprising change in her held me speechless. All the animation of\r\nthe breakfast table was gone: there was no hint of the response with\r\nwhich, before, she had met my nonsensical sallies. She stood there,\r\nwhite-lipped, unsmiling, staring down the dusty road. One hand was\r\nclenched tight over some small object. Her eyes dropped to it from the\r\ndistant road, and then closed, with a quick, indrawn breath. Her color\r\ncame back slowly. Whatever had caused the change, she said nothing.\r\nShe was anxious to leave at once, almost impatient over my deliberate\r\nmasculine way of getting my things together. Afterward I recalled that I\r\nhad wanted to explore the barn for a horse and some sort of a vehicle to\r\ntake us to the trolley, and that she had refused to allow me to look. I\r\nremembered many things later that might have helped me, and did not.\r\nAt the time, I was only completely bewildered. Save the wreck, the\r\nresponsibility for which lay between Providence and the engineer of the\r\nsecond section, all the events of that strange morning were logically\r\nconnected; they came from one cause, and tended unerringly to one end.\r\nBut the cause was buried, the end not yet in view.\r\n\r\nNot until we had left the house well behind did the girl's face relax\r\nits tense lines. I was watching her more closely than I had realized,\r\nfor when we had gone a little way along the road she turned to me\r\nalmost petulantly. \u201cPlease don't stare so at me,\u201d she said, to my sudden\r\nconfusion. \u201cI know the hat is dreadful. Green always makes me look\r\nghastly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps it was the green.\u201d I was unaccountably relieved. \u201cDo you know,\r\na few minutes ago, you looked almost pallid to me!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe glanced at me quickly, but I was gazing ahead. We were out of\r\nsight of the house, now, and with every step away from it the girl was\r\nobviously relieved. Whatever she held in her hand, she never glanced at\r\nit. But she was conscious of it every second. She seemed to come to\r\na decision about it while we were still in sight of the gate, for\r\nshe murmured something and turned back alone, going swiftly, her feet\r\nstirring up small puffs of dust at every step. She fastened something\r\nto the gate-post,--I could see the nervous haste with which she worked.\r\nWhen she joined me again it was without explanation. But the clenched\r\nfingers were free now, and while she looked tired and worn, the strain\r\nhad visibly relaxed.\r\n\r\nWe walked along slowly in the general direction of the suburban trolley\r\nline. Once a man with an empty wagon offered us a lift, but after a\r\nglance at the springless vehicle I declined.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe ends of the bone think they are castanets as it is,\u201d I explained.\r\n\u201cBut the lady--\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young lady, however, declined and we went on together. Once, when\r\nthe trolley line was in sight, she got a pebble in her low shoe, and we\r\nsat down under a tree until she found the cause of the trouble.\r\n\r\n\u201cI--I don't know what I should have done without you,\u201d I blundered.\r\n\u201cMoral support and--and all that. Do you know, my first conscious\r\nthought after the wreck was of relief that you had not been hurt?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was sitting beside me, where a big chestnut tree shaded the road,\r\nand I surprised a look of misery on her face that certainly my words had\r\nnot been meant to produce.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd my first thought,\u201d she said slowly, \u201cwas regret that I--that I\r\nhadn't been obliterated, blown out like a candle. Please don't look like\r\nthat! I am only talking.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut her lips were trembling, and because the little shams of society are\r\nforgotten at times like this, I leaned over and patted her hand lightly,\r\nwhere it rested on the grass beside me.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must not say those things,\u201d I expostulated. \u201cPerhaps, after all,\r\nyour friends--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI had no friends on the train.\u201d Her voice was hard again, her tone\r\nfinal. She drew her hand from under mine, not quickly, but decisively. A\r\ncar was in sight, coming toward us. The steel finger of civilization, of\r\npropriety, of visiting cards and formal introductions was beckoning us\r\nin. Miss West put on her shoe.\r\n\r\nWe said little on the car. The few passengers stared at us frankly, and\r\ndiscussed the wreck, emphasizing its horrors. The girl did not seem to\r\nhear. Once she turned to me with the quick, unexpected movement that was\r\none of her charms.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not wish my mother to know I was in the accident,\u201d she said. \u201cWill\r\nyou please not tell Richey about having met me?\u201d\r\n\r\nI gave my promise, of course. Again, when we were almost into Baltimore,\r\nshe asked to examine the gun-metal cigarette case, and sat silent with\r\nit in her hands, while I told of the early morning's events on the\r\nOntario.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you see,\u201d I finished, \u201cthis grip, everything I have on, belongs to\r\na fellow named Sullivan. He probably left the train before the\r\nwreck,--perhaps just after the murder.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so--you think he committed the--the crime?\u201d Her eyes were on the\r\ncigarette case.\r\n\r\n\u201cNaturally,\u201d I said. \u201cA man doesn't jump off a Pullman car in the middle\r\nof the night in another man's clothes, unless he is trying to get away\r\nfrom something. Besides the dirk, there were the stains that you saw.\r\nWhy, I have the murdered man's pocket-book in this valise at my feet.\r\nWhat does that look like?\u201d\r\n\r\nI colored when I saw the ghost of a smile hovering around the corners\r\nof her mouth. \u201cThat is,\u201d I finished, \u201cif you care to believe that I am\r\ninnocent.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe sustaining chain of her small gold bag gave way just then. She did\r\nnot notice it. I picked it up and slid the trinket into my pocket for\r\nsafekeeping, where I promptly forgot it. Afterwards I wished I had let\r\nit lie unnoticed on the floor of that dirty little suburban car, and\r\neven now, when I see a woman carelessly dangling a similar feminine\r\ntrinket, I shudder involuntarily: there comes back to me the memory of\r\na girl's puzzled eyes under the brim of a flopping hat, the haunting\r\nsuspicion of the sleepless nights that followed.\r\n\r\nJust then I was determined that my companion should not stray back to\r\nthe wreck, and to that end I was determinedly facetious.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know that it is Sunday?\u201d she asked suddenly, \u201cand that we are\r\nactually ragged?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind that,\u201d I retorted. \u201cAll Baltimore is divided on Sunday into\r\nthree parts, those who rise up and go to church, those who rise up\r\nand read the newspapers, and those who don't rise up. The first are\r\nsomewhere between the creed and the sermon, and we need not worry about\r\nthe others.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou treat me like a child,\u201d she said almost pettishly. \u201cDon't try so\r\nhard to be cheerful. It--it is almost ghastly.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter that I subsided like a pricked balloon, and the remainder of the\r\nride was made in silence. The information that she would go to friends\r\nin the city was a shock: it meant an earlier separation than I had\r\nplanned for. But my arm was beginning again. In putting her into a cab\r\nI struck it and gritted my teeth with the pain. It was probably for that\r\nreason that I forgot the gold bag.\r\n\r\nShe leaned forward and held out her hand. \u201cI may not have another chance\r\nto thank you,\u201d she said, \u201cand I think I would better not try, anyhow.\r\nI cannot tell you how grateful I am.\u201d I muttered something about the\r\ngratitude being mine: owing to the knock I was seeing two cabs, and two\r\ngirls were holding out two hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cRemember,\u201d they were both saying, \u201cyou have never met me, Mr. Blakeley.\r\nAnd--if you ever hear anything about me--that is not--pleasant, I want\r\nyou to think the best you can of me. Will you?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe two girls were one now, with little flashes of white light playing\r\nall around. \u201cI--I'm afraid that I shall think too well for my own good,\u201d\r\n I said unsteadily. And the cab drove on.\r\n\nI had my arm done up temporarily in Baltimore and took the next train\r\nhome. I was pretty far gone when I stumbled out of a cab almost into the\r\nscandalized arms of Mrs. Klopton. In fifteen minutes I was in bed, with\r\nthat good woman piling on blankets and blistering me in unprotected\r\nplaces with hot-water bottles. And in an hour I had a whiff of\r\nchloroform and Doctor Williams had set the broken bone.\r\n\r\nI dropped asleep then, waking in the late twilight to a realization that\r\nI was at home again, without the papers that meant conviction for\r\nAndy Bronson, with a charge of murder hanging over my head, and with\r\nsomething more than an impression of the girl my best friend was in love\r\nwith, a girl moreover who was almost as great an enigma as the crime\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I'm no hand at guessing riddles,\u201d I groaned half aloud. Mrs.\r\nKlopton came over promptly and put a cold cloth on my forehead.\r\n\r\n\u201cEuphemia,\u201d she said to some one outside the door, \u201ctelephone the doctor\r\nthat he is still rambling, but that he has switched from green ribbons\r\nto riddles.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere's nothing the matter with me, Mrs. Klopton,\u201d I rebelled. \u201cI was\r\nonly thinking out loud. Confound that cloth: it's trickling all over\r\nme!\u201d I gave it a fling, and heard it land with a soggy thud on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n\u201cThinking out loud is delirium,\u201d Mrs. Klopton said imperturbably. \u201cA\r\nfresh cloth, Euphemia.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis time she held it on with a firm pressure that I was too weak to\r\nresist. I expostulated feebly that I was drowning, which she also laid\r\nto my mental exaltation, and then I finally dropped into a damp sleep.\r\nIt was probably midnight when I roused again. I had been dreaming of the\r\nwreck, and it was inexpressibly comforting to feel the stability of my\r\nbed, and to realize the equal stability of Mrs. Klopton, who sat, fully\r\nattired, by the night light, reading Science and Health.\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes that book say anything about opening the windows on a hot night?\u201d\r\n I suggested, when I had got my bearings.\r\n\r\nShe put it down immediately and came over to me. If there is one time\r\nwhen Mrs. Klopton is chastened--and it is the only time--it is when\r\nshe reads Science and Health. \u201cI don't like to open the shutters, Mr.\r\nLawrence,\u201d she explained. \u201cNot since the night you went away.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut, pressed further, she refused to explain. \u201cThe doctor said you were\r\nnot to be excited,\u201d she persisted. \u201cHere's your beef tea.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a drop until you tell me,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cBesides, you know very\r\nwell there's nothing the matter with me. This arm of mine is only a\r\nfalse belief.\u201d I sat up gingerly. \u201cNow--why don't you open that window?\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Klopton succumbed. \u201cBecause there are queer goings-on in that house\r\nnext door,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you will take the beef tea, Mr. Lawrence, I\r\nwill tell you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe queer goings-on, however, proved to be slightly disappointing. It\r\nseemed that after I left on Friday night, a light was seen flitting\r\nfitfully through the empty house next door. Euphemia had seen it first\r\nand called Mrs. Klopton. Together they had watched it breathlessly until\r\nit disappeared on the lower floor.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou should have been a writer of ghost stories,\u201d I said, giving my\r\npillows a thump. \u201cAnd so it was fitting flitfully!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat's what it was doing,\u201d she reiterated. \u201cFitting flitfully--I mean\r\nflitting fitfully--how you do throw me out, Mr. Lawrence! And what's\r\nmore, it came again!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, come now, Mrs. Klopton,\u201d I objected, \u201cghosts are like lightning;\r\nthey never strike twice in the same night. That is only worth half a cup\r\nof beef tea.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may ask Euphemia,\u201d she retorted with dignity. \u201cNot more than an\r\nhour after, there was a light there again. We saw it through the\r\nchinks of the shutters. Only--this time it began at the lower floor and\r\nclimbed!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou oughtn't to tell ghost stories at night,\u201d came McKnight's voice\r\nfrom the doorway. \u201cReally, Mrs. Klopton, I'm amazed at you. You old\r\nduffer! I've got you to thank for the worst day of my life.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Klopton gulped. Then realizing that the \u201cold duffer\u201d was meant for\r\nme, she took her empty cup and went out muttering.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Pirate's crazy about me, isn't she?\u201d McKnight said to the closing\r\ndoor. Then he swung around and held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy Jove,\u201d he said, \u201cI've been laying you out all day, lilies on the\r\ndoor-bell, black gloves, everything. If you had had the sense of a\r\nmosquito in a snow-storm, you would have telephoned me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never even thought of it.\u201d I was filled with remorse. \u201cUpon my word,\r\nRich, I hadn't an idea beyond getting away from that place. If you had\r\nseen what I saw--\u201d\r\n\r\nMcKnight stopped me. \u201cSeen it! Why, you lunatic, I've been digging for\r\nyou all day in the ruins! I've lunched and dined on horrors. Give me\r\nsomething to rinse them down, Lollie.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe had fished the key of the cellarette from its hiding-place in my shoe\r\nbag and was mixing himself what he called a Bernard Shaw--a foundation\r\nof brandy and soda, with a little of everything else in sight to give it\r\nsnap. Now that I saw him clearly, he looked weary and grimy. I hated to\r\ntell him what I knew he was waiting to hear, but there was no use wading\r\nin by inches. I ducked and got it over.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe notes are gone, Rich,\u201d I said, as quietly as I could. In spite of\r\nhimself his face fell.\r\n\r\n\u201cI--of course I expected it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut--Mrs. Klopton said over the\r\ntelephone that you had brought home a grip and I hoped--well, Lord knows\r\nwe ought not to complain. You're here, damaged, but here.\u201d He lifted his\r\nglass. \u201cHappy days, old man!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you will give me that black bottle and a teaspoon, I'll drink that\r\nin arnica, or whatever the stuff is; Rich,--the notes were gone before\r\nthe wreck!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe wheeled and stared at me, the bottle in his hand. \u201cLost, strayed or\r\nstolen?\u201d he queried with forced lightness.\r\n\r\n\u201cStolen, although I believe the theft was incidental to something else.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Klopton came in at that moment, with an eggnog in her hand. She\r\nglanced at the clock, and, without addressing any one in particular, she\r\nintimated that it was time for self-respecting folks to be at home in\r\nbed. McKnight, who could never resist a fling at her back, spoke to me\r\nin a stage whisper.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs she talking still? or again?\u201d he asked, just before the door closed.\r\nThere was a second's indecision with the knob, then, judging discretion\r\nthe better part, Mrs. Klopton went away.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, then,\u201d McKnight said, settling himself in a chair beside the\r\nbed, \u201cspit it out. Not the wreck--I know all I want about that. But the\r\ntheft. I can tell you beforehand that it was a woman.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had crawled painfully out of bed, and was in the act of pouring the\r\negg-nog down the pipe of the washstand. I paused, with the glass in the\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\u201cA woman!\u201d I repeated, startled. \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don't know the first principles of a good detective yarn,\u201d he said\r\nscornfully. \u201cOf course, it was the woman in the empty house next door.\r\nYou said it was brass pipes, you will remember. Well--on with the dance:\r\nlet joy be unconfined.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo I told the story; I had told it so many times that day that I did it\r\nautomatically. And I told about the girl with the bronze hair, and my\r\nsuspicions. But I did not mention Alison West. McKnight listened to the\r\nend without interruption. When I had finished he drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d he said. \u201cThat's something of a mess, isn't it? If you can only\r\nprove your mild and child-like disposition, they couldn't hold you for\r\nthe murder--which is a regular ten-twent-thirt crime, anyhow. But the\r\nnotes--that's different. They are not burned, anyhow. Your man wasn't on\r\nthe train--therefore, he wasn't in the wreck. If he didn't know what\r\nhe was taking, as you seem to think, he probably reads the papers, and\r\nunless he is a fathead, he's awake by this time to what he's got. He'll\r\ntry to sell them to Bronson, probably.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOr to us,\u201d I put in.\r\n\r\nWe said nothing for a few minutes. McKnight smoked a cigarette and\r\nstared at a photograph of Candida over the mantel. Candida is the best\r\npony for a heavy mount in seven states.\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn't go to Richmond,\u201d he observed finally. The remark followed my\r\nown thoughts so closely that I started. \u201cMiss West is not home yet from\r\nSeal Harbor.\u201d\r\n\r\nReceiving no response, he lapsed again into thoughtful silence. Mrs.\r\nKlopton came in just as the clock struck one, and made preparation for\r\nthe night by putting a large gaudy comfortable into an arm-chair in the\r\ndressing-room, with a smaller, stiff-backed chair for her feet. She was\r\nwonderfully attired in a dressing-gown that was reminiscent, in parts,\r\nof all the ones she had given me for a half dozen Christmases, and she\r\nhad a purple veil wrapped around her head, to hide Heaven knows what\r\ndeficiency. She examined the empty egg-nog glass, inquired what the\r\nevening paper had said about the weather, and then stalked into the\r\ndressing-room, and prepared, with much ostentatious creaking, to sit up\r\nall night.\r\n\r\nWe fell silent again, while McKnight traced a rough outline of the\r\nberths on the white table-cover, and puzzled it out slowly. It was\r\nsomething like this:\r\n            ____________________________________\r\n           |     12     |    10     |     8     |\r\n           |____________|___________|___________|\r\n           |_______________AISLE________________|\r\n           |     11     |    9      |     7     |\r\n           |____________|___________|___________|\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think he changed the tags on seven and nine, so that when you went\r\nback to bed you thought you were crawling into nine, when it was really\r\nseven, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cProbably-yes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen toward morning, when everybody was asleep, your theory is that he\r\nchanged the numbers again and left the train.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can't think of anything else,\u201d I replied wearily.\r\n\r\n\u201cJove, what a game of bridge that fellow would play! It was like\r\nfinessing an eight-spot and winning out. They would scarcely have\r\ndoubted your story had the tags been reversed in the morning. He\r\ncertainly left you in a bad way. Not a jury in the country would stand\r\nout against the stains, the stiletto, and the murdered man's pocket-book\r\nin your possession.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you think Sullivan did it?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said McKnight confidently. \u201cUnless you did it in your\r\nsleep. Look at the stains on his pillow, and the dirk stuck into it. And\r\ndidn't he have the man Harrington's pocket-book?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why did he go off without the money?\u201d I persisted. \u201cAnd where does\r\nthe bronze-haired girl come in?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSearch me,\u201d McKnight retorted flippantly. \u201cInflammation of the\r\nimagination on your part.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen there is the piece of telegram. It said lower ten, car seven. It's\r\nextremely likely that she had it. That telegram was about me, Richey.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm getting a headache,\u201d he said, putting out his cigarette against the\r\nsole of his shoe. \u201cAll I'm certain of just now is that if there hadn't\r\nbeen a wreck, by this time you'd be sitting in an eight by ten cell, and\r\nfeeling like the rhyme for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut listen to this,\u201d I contended, as he picked up his hat, \u201cthis fellow\r\nSullivan is a fugitive, and he's a lot more likely to make advances to\r\nBronson than to us. We could have the case continued, release Bronson on\r\nbail and set a watch on him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot my watch,\u201d McKnight protested. \u201cIt's a family heirloom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou'd better go home,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cGo home and go to bed. You're\r\nsleepy. You can have Sullivan's red necktie to dream over if you think\r\nit will help any.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Klopton's voice came drowsily from the next room, punctuated by a\r\nyawn. \u201cOh, I forgot to tell you,\u201d she called, with the suspicious lisp\r\nwhich characterizes her at night, \u201csomebody called up about noon, Mr.\r\nLawrence. It was long distance, and he said he would call again. The\r\nname was\u201d--she yawned--\u201cSullivan.\u201d\r\n\nI have always smiled at those cases of spontaneous combustion which,\r\nlike fusing the component parts of a seidlitz powder, unite two people\r\nin a bubbling and ephemeral ecstasy. But surely there is possible, with\r\nbut a single meeting, an attraction so great, a community of mind and\r\ninterest so strong, that between that first meeting and the next the\r\nbond may grow into something stronger. This is especially true, I fancy,\r\nof people with temperament, the modern substitute for imagination. It is\r\na nice question whether lovers begin to love when they are together, or\r\nwhen they are apart.\r\n\r\nNot that I followed any such line of reasoning at the time. I would not\r\neven admit my folly to myself. But during the restless hours of that\r\nfirst night after the accident, when my back ached with lying on it,\r\nand any other position was torture, I found my thoughts constantly going\r\nback to Alison West. I dropped into a doze, to dream of touching\r\nher fingers again to comfort her, and awoke to find I had patted a\r\nteaspoonful of medicine out of Mrs. Klopton's indignant hand. What was\r\nit McKnight had said about making an egregious ass of myself?\r\n\r\nAnd that brought me back to Richey, and I fancy I groaned. There is no\r\nuse expatiating on the friendship between two men who have gone together\r\nthrough college, have quarreled and made it up, fussed together over\r\npolitics and debated creeds for years: men don't need to be told, and\r\nwomen can not understand. Nevertheless, I groaned. If it had been any\r\none but Rich!\r\n\r\nSome things were mine, however, and I would hold them: the halcyon\r\nbreakfast, the queer hat, the pebble in her small shoe, the gold bag\r\nwith the broken chain--the bag! Why, it was in my pocket at that moment.\r\n\r\nI got up painfully and found my coat. Yes, there was the purse, bulging\r\nwith an opulent suggestion of wealth inside. I went back to bed again,\r\nsomewhat dizzy, between effort and the touch of the trinket, so lately\r\nhers. I held it up by its broken chain and gloated over it. By careful\r\nattention to orders, I ought to be out in a day or so. Then--I could\r\nreturn it to her. I really ought to do that: it was valuable, and I\r\nwouldn't care to trust it to the mail. I could run down to Richmond, and\r\nsee her once--there was no disloyalty to Rich in that.\r\n\r\nI had no intention of opening the little bag. I put it under my\r\npillow--which was my reason for refusing to have the linen slips\r\nchanged, to Mrs. Klopton's dismay. And sometimes during the morning,\r\nwhile I lay under a virgin field of white, ornamented with strange\r\nflowers, my cigarettes hidden beyond discovery, and Science and Health\r\non a table by my elbow, as if by the merest accident, I slid my hand\r\nunder my pillow and touched it reverently.\r\n\r\nMcKnight came in about eleven. I heard his car at the curb, followed\r\nalmost immediately by his slam at the front door, and his usual clamor\r\non the stairs. He had a bottle under his arm, rightly surmising that\r\nI had been forbidden stimulant, and a large box of cigarettes in his\r\npocket, suspecting my deprivation.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cHow did you sleep after keeping me up half\r\nthe night?\u201d\r\n\r\nI slid my hand around: the purse was well covered. \u201cHave it now, or wait\r\ntill I get the cork out?\u201d he rattled on.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't want anything,\u201d I protested. \u201cI wish you wouldn't be so darned\r\ncheerful, Richey.\u201d He stopped whistling to stare at me.\r\n\r\n\u201c'I am saddest when I sing!'\u201d he quoted unctuously. \u201cIt's pure reaction,\r\nLollie. Yesterday the sky was low: I was digging for my best friend.\r\nTo-day--he lies before me, his peevish self. Yesterday I thought the\r\nnotes were burned: to-day--I look forward to a good cross-country chase,\r\nand with luck we will draw.\u201d His voice changed suddenly. \u201cYesterday--she\r\nwas in Seal Harbor. To-day--she is here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere in Washington?\u201d I asked, as naturally as I could.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Going to stay a week or two.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \u201cOh, I had a little hen and she had a wooden leg\r\n     And nearly every morning she used to lay an egg--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you stop that racket, Rich! It's the real thing this time, I\r\nsuppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n     \u201cShe's the best little chicken that we have on the farm\r\n     And another little drink won't do us any harm--\u201d\r\n\r\nhe finished, twisting out the corkscrew. Then he came over and sat down\r\non the bed.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said judicially, \u201csince you drag it from me, I think perhaps\r\nit is. You--you're such a confirmed woman-hater that I hardly knew how\r\nyou would take it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing of the sort,\u201d I denied testily. \u201cBecause a man reaches the age\r\nof thirty without making maudlin love to every--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI've taken to long country rides,\u201d he went on reflectively, without\r\nlistening to me, \u201cand yesterday I ran over a sheep; nearly went into the\r\nditch. But there's a Providence that watches over fools and lovers, and\r\njust now I know darned well that I'm one, and I have a sneaking idea I'm\r\nboth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are both,\u201d I said with disgust. \u201cIf you can be rational for one\r\nmoment, I wish you would tell me why that man Sullivan called me over\r\nthe telephone yesterday morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cProbably hadn't yet discovered the Bronson notes--providing you hold to\r\nyour theory that the theft was incidental to the murder. May have wanted\r\nhis own clothes again, or to thank you for yours. Search me: I can't\r\nthink of anything else.\u201d The doctor came in just then.\r\n\r\nAs I said before, I think a lot of my doctor--when I am ill. He is a\r\nyoung man, with an air of breezy self-confidence and good humor.\r\nHe looked directly past the bottle, which is a very valuable\r\naccomplishment, and shook hands with McKnight until I could put the\r\ncigarettes under the bedclothes. He had interdicted tobacco. Then he sat\r\ndown beside the bed and felt around the bandages with hands as gentle as\r\na baby's.\r\n\r\n\u201cPretty good shape,\u201d he said. \u201cHow did you sleep?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, occasionally,\u201d I replied. \u201cI would like to sit up, doctor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNonsense. Take a rest while you have an excuse for it. I wish to\r\nthunder I could stay in bed for a day or so. I was up all night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave a drink,\u201d McKnight said, pushing over the bottle.\r\n\r\n\u201cTwins!\u201d The doctor grinned.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave two drinks.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the medical man refused.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wouldn't even wear a champagne-colored necktie during business\r\nhours,\u201d he explained. \u201cBy the way, I had another case from your\r\naccident, Mr. Blakeley, late yesterday afternoon. Under the tongue,\r\nplease.\u201d He stuck a thermometer in my mouth.\r\n\r\nI had a sudden terrible vision of the amateur detective coming to light,\r\nnote-book, cheerful impertinence and incriminating data. \u201cA small man?\u201d\r\n I demanded, \u201cgray hair--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKeep your mouth closed,\u201d the doctor said peremptorily. \u201cNo. A woman,\r\nwith a fractured skull. Beautiful case. Van Kirk was up to his eyes and\r\nsent for me. Hemorrhage, right-sided paralysis, irregular pupils--all\r\nthe trimmings. Worked for two hours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid she recover?\u201d McKnight put in. He was examining the doctor with a\r\nnew awe.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe lifted her right arm before I left,\u201d the doctor finished cheerily,\r\n\u201cso the operation was a success, even if she should die.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood Heavens,\u201d McKnight broke in, \u201cand I thought you were just an\r\nordinary mortal, like the rest of us! Let me touch you for luck. Was she\r\npretty?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and young. Had a wealth of bronze-colored hair. Upon my soul, I\r\nhated to cut it.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcKnight and I exchanged glances.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know her name, doctor?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. The nurses said her clothes came from a Pittsburg tailor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is not conscious, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; she may be, to-morrow--or in a week.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked at the thermometer, murmured something about liquid diet,\r\navoiding my eye--Mrs. Klopton was broiling a chop at the time--and\r\ntook his departure, humming cheerfully as he went down-stairs. McKnight\r\nlooked after him wistfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cJove, I wish I had his constitution,\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cNeither nerves nor\r\nheart! What a chauffeur he would make!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut I was serious.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have an idea,\u201d I said grimly, \u201cthat this small matter of the murder\r\nis going to come up again, and that your uncle will be in the deuce of\r\na fix if it does. If that woman is going to die, somebody ought to be\r\naround to take her deposition. She knows a lot, if she didn't do it\r\nherself. I wish you would go down to the telephone and get the hospital.\r\nFind out her name, and if she is conscious.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcKnight went under protest. \u201cI haven't much time,\u201d he said, looking at\r\nhis watch. \u201cI'm to meet Mrs. West and Alison at one. I want you to know\r\nthem, Lollie. You would like the mother.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not the daughter?\u201d I inquired. I touched the little gold bag under\r\nthe pillow.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said judicially, \u201cyou've always declared against the\r\nimmaturity and romantic nonsense of very young women--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never said anything of the sort,\u201d I retorted furiously.\r\n\r\n\u201c'There is more satisfaction to be had out of a good saddle horse!'\u201d he\r\nquoted me. \u201c'More excitement out of a polo pony, and as for the eternal\r\nmatrimonial chase, give me instead a good stubble, a fox, some decent\r\nhounds and a hunter, and I'll show you the real joys of the chase!'\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor Heaven's sake, go down to the telephone, you make my head ache,\u201d I\r\nsaid savagely.\r\n\r\nI hardly know what prompted me to take out the gold purse and look at\r\nit. It was an imbecile thing to do--call it impulse, sentimentality,\r\nwhat you wish. I brought it out, one eye on the door, for Mrs.\r\nKlopton has a ready eye and a noiseless shoe. But the house was quiet.\r\nDown-stairs McKnight was flirting with the telephone central and\r\nthere was an odor of boneset tea in the air. I think Mrs. Klopton was\r\nfascinated out of her theories by the \u201cboneset\u201d in connection with the\r\nfractured arm.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I held up the bag and looked at it. It must have been\r\nunfastened, for the next instant there was an avalanche on the snowfield\r\nof the counterpane--some money, a wisp of a handkerchief, a tiny booklet\r\nwith thin leaves, covered with a powdery substance--and a necklace. I\r\ndrew myself up slowly and stared at the necklace.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the semi-barbaric affairs that women are wearing now, a\r\nheavy pendant of gold chains and carved cameos, swung from a thin neck\r\nchain of the same metal. The necklace was broken: in three places the\r\nlinks were pulled apart and the cameos swung loose and partly detached.\r\nBut it was the supporting chain that held my eye and fascinated with\r\nits sinister suggestion. Three inches of it had been snapped off, and as\r\nwell as I knew anything on earth, I knew that the bit of chain that the\r\namateur detective had found, blood-stain and all, belonged just there.\r\n\r\nAnd there was no one I could talk to about it, no one to tell me how\r\nhideously absurd it was, no one to give me a slap and tell me there are\r\ntons of fine gold chains made every year, or to point out the long arm\r\nof coincidence!\r\n\r\nWith my one useful hand I fumbled the things back into the bag and\r\nthrust it deep out of sight among the pillows. Then I lay back in a cold\r\nperspiration. What connection had Alison West with this crime? Why had\r\nshe stared so at the gun-metal cigarette case that morning on the train?\r\nWhat had alarmed her so at the farm-house? What had she taken back to\r\nthe gate? Why did she wish she had not escaped from the wreck? And last,\r\nin Heaven's name, how did a part of her necklace become torn off and\r\ncovered with blood?\r\n\r\nDown-stairs McKnight was still at the telephone, and amusing himself\r\nwith Mrs. Klopton in the interval of waiting.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did he come home in a gray suit, when he went away in a blue?\u201d he\r\nrepeated. \u201cWell, wrecks are queer things, Mrs. Klopton. The suit may\r\nhave turned gray with fright. Or perhaps wrecks do as queer stunts as\r\nlightning. Friend of mine once was struck by lightning; he and the caddy\r\nhad taken refuge under a tree. After the flash, when they recovered\r\nconsciousness, there was my friend in the caddy's clothes, and the caddy\r\nin his. And as my friend was a large man and the caddy a very small\r\nboy--\u201d\r\n\r\nMcKnight's story was interrupted by the indignant slam of the\r\ndining-room door. He was obliged to wait some time, and even his eternal\r\ncheerfulness was ebbing when he finally got the hospital.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs Doctor Van Kirk there?\u201d he asked. \u201cNot there? Well, can you tell me\r\nhow the patient is whom Doctor Williams, from Washington, operated on\r\nlast night? Well, I'm glad of that. Is she conscious? Do you happen to\r\nknow her name? Yes, I'll hold the line.\u201d There was a long pause, then\r\nMcKnight's voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cHello--yes. Thank you very much. Good-by.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe came up-stairs, two steps at a time.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here,\u201d he said, bursting into the room, \u201cthere may be something in\r\nyour theory, after all. The woman's name--it may be a coincidence, but\r\nit's curious--her name is Sullivan.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d I said, sitting up suddenly in bed. \u201cShe's\r\nprobably a sister of that scoundrel in lower seven, and she was afraid\r\nof what he might do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I'll go there some day soon. She's not conscious yet. In\r\nthe meantime, the only thing I can do is to keep an eye, through a\r\ndetective, on the people who try to approach Bronson. We'll have the\r\ncase continued, anyhow, in the hope that the stolen notes will sooner or\r\nlater turn up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cConfound this arm,\u201d I said, paying for my energy with some excruciating\r\nthrobs. \u201cThere's so much to be looked after, and here I am, bandaged,\r\nsplinted, and generally useless. It's a beastly shame.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon't forget that I am here,\u201d said McKnight pompously. \u201cAnd another\r\nthing, when you feel this way just remember there are two less desirable\r\nplaces where you might be. One is jail, and the other is--\u201d He strummed\r\non an imaginary harp, with devotional eyes.\r\n\r\nBut McKnight's light-heartedness jarred on me that morning. I lay and\r\nfrowned under my helplessness. When by chance I touched the little gold\r\nbag, it seemed to scorch my fingers. Richey, finding me unresponsive,\r\nleft to keep his luncheon engagement with Alison West. As he clattered\r\ndown the stairs, I turned my back to the morning sunshine and abandoned\r\nmyself to misery. By what strain on her frayed nerves was Alison West\r\nkeeping up, I wondered? Under the circumstances, would I dare to return\r\nthe bag? Knowing that I had it, would she hate me for my knowledge? Or\r\nhad I exaggerated the importance of the necklace, and in that case had\r\nshe forgotten me already?\r\n\r\nBut McKnight had not gone, after all. I heard him coming back, his voice\r\npreceding him, and I groaned with irritation.\r\n\r\n\u201cWake up!\u201d he called. \u201cSomebody's sent you a lot of flowers. Please hold\r\nthe box, Mrs. Klopton; I'm going out to be run down by an automobile.\u201d\r\n\r\nI roused to feeble interest. My brother's wife is punctilious about such\r\nthings; all the new babies in the family have silver rattles, and all\r\nthe sick people flowers.\r\n\r\nMcKnight pulled up an armful of roses, and held them out to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cWonder who they're from?\u201d he said, fumbling in the box for a card.\r\n\u201cThere's no name--yes, here's one.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe held it up and read it with exasperating slowness.\r\n\r\n     \u201c'Best wishes for an early recovery.\r\n                         A COMPANION IN MISFORTUNE.'\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what do you know about that!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cThat's something you\r\ndidn't tell me, Lollie.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was hardly worth mentioning,\u201d I said mendaciously, with my heart\r\nbeating until I could hear it. She had not forgotten, after all.\r\n\r\nMcKnight took a bud and fastened it in his button-hole. I'm afraid I was\r\nnot especially pleasant about it. They were her roses, and anyhow, they\r\nwere meant for me. Richey left very soon, with an irritating final grin\r\nat the box.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-by, sir woman-hater,\u201d he jeered at me from the door.\r\n\r\nSo he wore one of the roses she had sent me, to luncheon with her, and\r\nI lay back among my pillows and tried to remember that it was his game,\r\nanyhow, and that I wasn't even drawing cards. To remember that, and to\r\nforget the broken necklace under my head!\r\n\nI was in the house for a week. Much of that time I spent in composing\r\nand destroying letters of thanks to Miss West, and in growling at the\r\ndoctor. McKnight dropped in daily, but he was less cheerful than usual.\r\nNow and then I caught him eying me as if he had something to say, but\r\nwhatever it was he kept it to himself. Once during the week he went to\r\nBaltimore and saw the woman in the hospital there. From the description\r\nI had little difficulty in recognizing the young woman who had been with\r\nthe murdered man in Pittsburg. But she was still unconscious. An elderly\r\naunt had appeared, a gaunt person in black, who sat around like a\r\nbuzzard on a fence, according to McKnight, and wept, in a mixed figure,\r\ninto a damp handkerchief.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of my imprisonment he stopped in to thrash out a case\r\nthat was coming up in court the next day, and to play a game of double\r\nsolitaire with me.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho won the ball game?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were licked. Ask me something pleasant. Oh, by the way, Bronson's\r\nout to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm glad I'm not on his bond,\u201d I said pessimistically. \u201cHe'll clear\r\nout.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot he.\u201d McKnight pounced on my ace. \u201cHe's no fool. Don't you suppose\r\nhe knows you took those notes to Pittsburg? The papers were full of it.\r\nAnd he knows you escaped with your life and a broken arm from the wreck.\r\nWhat do we do next? The Commonwealth continues the case. A deaf man on a\r\ndark night would know those notes are missing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon't play so fast,\u201d I remonstrated. \u201cI have only one arm to your two.\r\nWho is trailing Bronson? Did you try to get Johnson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI asked for him, but he had some work on hand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe murder's evidently a dead issue,\u201d I reflected. \u201cNo, I'm not joking.\r\nThe wreck destroyed all the evidence. But I'm firmly convinced those\r\nnotes will be offered, either to us or to Bronson very soon. Johnson's\r\na blackguard, but he's a good detective. He could make his fortune as a\r\ngame dog. What's he doing?\u201d\r\n\r\nMcKnight put down his cards, and rising, went to the window. As he held\r\nthe curtain back his customary grin looked a little forced.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo tell you the truth, Lollie,\u201d he said, \u201cfor the last two days he has\r\nbeen watching a well-known Washington attorney named Lawrence Blakeley.\r\nHe's across the street now.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt took a moment for me to grasp what he meant.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, it's ridiculous,\u201d I asserted. \u201cWhat would they trail me for? Go\r\nover and tell Johnson to get out of there, or I'll pot at him with my\r\nrevolver.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can tell him that yourself.\u201d McKnight paused and bent forward.\r\n\u201cHello, here's a visitor; little man with string halt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI won't see him,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cI've been bothered enough with\r\nreporters.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe listened together to Mrs. Klopton's expostulating tones in the lower\r\nhall and the creak of the boards as she came heavily up the stairs. She\r\nhad a piece of paper in her hand torn from a pocket account-book, and on\r\nit was the name, \u201cMr. Wilson Budd Hotchkiss. Important business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, well, show him up,\u201d I said resignedly. \u201cYou'd better put those\r\ncards away, Richey. I fancy it's the rector of the church around the\r\ncorner.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut when the door opened to admit a curiously alert little man,\r\nadjusting his glasses with nervous fingers, my face must have shown my\r\ndismay.\r\n\r\nIt was the amateur detective of the Ontario!\r\n\r\nI shook hands without enthusiasm. Here was the one survivor of the\r\nwrecked car who could do me any amount of harm. There was no hope that\r\nhe had forgotten any of the incriminating details. In fact, he held in\r\nhis hand the very note-book which contained them.\r\n\r\nHis manner was restrained, but it was evident he was highly excited.\r\nI introduced him to McKnight, who has the imagination I lack, and who\r\nplaced him at once, mentally.\r\n\r\n\u201cI only learned yesterday that you had been--er--saved,\u201d he said\r\nrapidly. \u201cTerrible accident--unspeakable. Dream about it all night and\r\nthink about it all day. Broken arm?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. He just wears the splint to be different from other people,\u201d\r\n McKnight drawled lazily. I glared at him: there was nothing to be gained\r\nby antagonizing the little man.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, a fractured humerus, which isn't as funny as it sounds.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHumerus-humorous! Pretty good,\u201d he cackled. \u201cI must say you keep up\r\nyour spirits pretty well, considering everything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou seem to have escaped injury,\u201d I parried. He was fumbling for\r\nsomething in his pockets.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I escaped,\u201d he replied abstractedly. \u201cRemarkable thing, too. I\r\nhaven't a doubt I would have broken my neck, but I landed on--you'll\r\nnever guess what! I landed head first on the very pillow which was under\r\ninspection at the time of the wreck. You remember, don't you? Where did\r\nI put that package?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe found it finally and opened it on a table, displaying with some\r\ntheatricalism a rectangular piece of muslin and a similar patch of\r\nstriped ticking.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou recognize it?\u201d he said. \u201cThe stains, you see, and the hole made by\r\nthe dirk. I tried to bring away the entire pillow, but they thought I\r\nwas stealing it, and made me give it up.\u201d\r\n\r\nRichey touched the pieces gingerly. \u201cBy George,\u201d he said, \u201cand you\r\ncarry that around in your pocket! What if you should mistake it for your\r\nhandkerchief?\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Hotchkiss was not listening. He stood bent somewhat forward,\r\nleaning over the table, and fixed me with his ferret-like eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you see the evening papers, Mr. Blakeley?\u201d he inquired.\r\n\r\nI glanced to where they lay unopened, and shook my head.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I have a disagreeable task,\u201d he said with evident relish. \u201cOf\r\ncourse, you had considered the matter of the man Harrington's death\r\nclosed, after the wreck. I did myself. As far as I was concerned, I\r\nmeant to let it remain so. There were no other survivors, at least none\r\nthat I knew of, and in spite of circumstances, there were a number of\r\npoints in your favor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I put in with a sarcasm that was lost on him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI verified your identity, for instance, as soon as I recovered from\r\nthe shock. Also--I found on inquiring of your tailor that you invariably\r\nwore dark clothing.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcKnight came forward threateningly. \u201cWho are you, anyhow?\u201d he demanded.\r\n\u201cAnd how is this any business of yours?\u201d Mr. Hotchkiss was entirely\r\nunruffled.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have a minor position here,\u201d he said, reaching for a visiting card.\r\n\u201cI am a very small patch on the seat of government, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcKnight muttered something about certain offensive designs against the\r\nsaid patch and retired grumbling to the window. Our visitor was opening\r\nthe paper with a tremendous expenditure of energy.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere it is. Listen.\u201d He read rapidly aloud:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Pittsburg police have sent to Baltimore two detectives who are\r\nlooking up the survivors of the ill-fated Washington Flier. It has\r\ntranspired that Simon Harrington, the Wood Street merchant of that city,\r\nwas not killed in the wreck, but was murdered in his berth the night\r\npreceding the accident. Shortly before the collision, John Flanders, the\r\nconductor of the Flier, sent this telegram to the chief of police:\r\n\r\n  \u201c'Body of Simon Harrington found stabbed in his berth, lower ten,\r\n  Ontario, at six-thirty this morning.\r\n                                        JOHN FLANDERS, Conductor.'\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is hoped that the survivors of the wrecked car Ontario will be\r\nfound, to tell what they know of the discovery of the crime.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. John Gilmore, head of the steel company for which Mr. Harrington\r\nwas purchasing agent, has signified his intention of sifting the matter\r\nto the bottom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you see,\u201d Hotchkiss concluded, \u201cthere's trouble brewing. You and I\r\nare the only survivors of that unfortunate car.\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not contradict him, but I knew of two others, at least: Alison\r\nWest, and the woman we had left beside the road that morning, babbling\r\nincoherently, her black hair tumbling over her white face.\r\n\r\n\u201cUnless we can find the man who occupied lower seven,\u201d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have already tried and failed. To find him would not clear you, of\r\ncourse, unless we could establish some connection between him and the\r\nmurdered man. It is the only thing I see, however. I have learned this\r\nmuch,\u201d Hotchkiss concluded: \u201cLower seven was reserved from Cresson.\u201d\r\n\r\nCresson! Where Alison West and Mrs. Curtis had taken the train!\r\n\r\nMcKnight came forward and suddenly held out his hand. \u201cMr. Hotchkiss,\u201d\r\n he said, \u201cI--I'm sorry if I have been offensive. I thought when you came\r\nin, that, like the Irishman and the government, you were 'forninst' us.\r\nIf you will put those cheerful relics out of sight somewhere, I should\r\nbe glad to have you dine with me at the Incubator.\u201d (His name for his\r\nbachelor apartment.) \u201cCompared with Johnson, you are the great original\r\nprotoplasm.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe strength of this was lost on Hotchkiss, but the invitation was\r\nclear. They went out together, and from my window I watched them get\r\ninto McKnight's car. It was raining, and at the corner the Cannonball\r\nskidded. Across the street my detective, Johnson, looked after them with\r\nhis crooked smile. As he turned up his collar he saw me, and lifted his\r\nhat.\r\n\r\nI left the window and sat down in the growing dusk. So the occupant of\r\nlower seven had got on the car at Cresson, probably with Alison West and\r\nher companion. There was some one she cared about enough to shield. I\r\nwent irritably to the door and summoned Mrs. Klopton.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may throw out those roses,\u201d I said without looking at her. \u201cThey\r\nare quite dead.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have been quite dead for three days,\u201d she retorted spitefully.\r\n\u201cEuphemia said you threatened to dismiss her if she touched them.\u201d\r\n\nBy Sunday evening, a week after the wreck, my inaction had goaded me to\r\nfrenzy. The very sight of Johnson across the street or lurking, always\r\nwithin sight of the house, kept me constantly exasperated. It was on\r\nthat day that things began to come to a focus, a burning-glass of events\r\nthat seemed to center on me.\r\n\r\nI dined alone that evening in no cheerful frame of mind. There had been\r\na polo game the day before and I had lent a pony, which is always a bad\r\nthing to do. And she had wrenched her shoulder, besides helping to\r\nlose the game. There was no one in town: the temperature was ninety and\r\nclimbing, and my left hand persistently cramped under its bandage.\r\n\r\nMrs. Klopton herself saw me served, my bread buttered and cut in\r\ntidbits, my meat ready for my fork. She hovered around me maternally,\r\nobviously trying to cheer me.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe paper says still warmer,\u201d she ventured. \u201cThe thermometer is\r\nninety-two now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd this coffee is two hundred and fifty,\u201d I said, putting down my cup.\r\n\u201cWhere is Euphemia? I haven't seen her around, or heard a dish smash all\r\nday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEuphemia is in bed,\u201d Mrs. Klopton said gravely. \u201cIs your meat cut\r\nsmall enough, Mr. Lawrence?\u201d Mrs. Klopton can throw more mystery into\r\nan ordinary sentence than any one I know. She can say, \u201cAre your sheets\r\ndamp, sir?\u201d And I can tell from her tone that the house across the\r\nstreet has been robbed, or that my left hand neighbor has appendicitis.\r\nSo now I looked up and asked the question she was waiting for.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat's the matter with Euphemia?\u201d I inquired idly.\r\n\r\n\u201cFrightened into her bed,\u201d Mrs. Klopton said in a stage whisper. \u201cShe's\r\nhad three hot water bottles and she hasn't done a thing all day but\r\nmoan.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe oughtn't to take hot water bottles,\u201d I said in my severest\r\ntone. \u201cOne would make me moan. You need not wait, I'll ring if I need\r\nanything.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Klopton sailed to the door, where she stopped and wheeled\r\nindignantly. \u201cI only hope you won't laugh on the wrong side of your face\r\nsome morning, Mr. Lawrence,\u201d she declared, with Christian fortitude.\r\n\u201cBut I warn you, I am going to have the police watch that house next\r\ndoor.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was half inclined to tell her that both it and we were under police\r\nsurveillance at that moment. But I like Mrs. Klopton, in spite of the\r\nfact that I make her life a torment for her, so I refrained.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast night, when the paper said it was going to storm, I sent Euphemia\r\nto the roof to bring the rugs in. Eliza had slipped out, although it was\r\nher evening in. Euphemia went up to the roof--it was eleven o'clock--and\r\nsoon I heard her running down-stairs crying. When she got to my room she\r\njust folded up on the floor. She said there was a black figure sitting\r\non the parapet of the house next door--the empty house--and that when\r\nshe appeared it rose and waved long black arms at her and spit like a\r\ncat.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had finished my dinner and was lighting a cigarette. \u201cIf there was any\r\none up there, which I doubt, they probably sneezed,\u201d I suggested. \u201cBut\r\nif you feel uneasy, I'll take a look around the roof to-night before\r\nI turn in. As far as Euphemia goes, I wouldn't be uneasy about\r\nher--doesn't she always have an attack of some sort when Eliza rings in\r\nan extra evening on her?\u201d\r\n\r\nSo I made a superficial examination of the window locks that night,\r\nvisiting parts of the house that I had not seen since I bought it. Then\r\nI went to the roof. Evidently it had not been intended for any purpose\r\nsave to cover the house, for unlike the houses around, there was no\r\nstaircase. A ladder and a trap-door led to it, and it required some nice\r\nbalancing on my part to get up with my useless arm. I made it, however,\r\nand found this unexplored part of my domain rather attractive. It was\r\ncooler than down-stairs, and I sat on the brick parapet and smoked my\r\nfinal cigarette. The roof of the empty house adjoined mine along the\r\nback wing, but investigation showed that the trap-door across the low\r\ndividing wall was bolted underneath.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing out of the ordinary anywhere, and so I assured\r\nMrs. Klopton. Needless to say, I did not tell her that I had left the\r\ntrap-door open, to see if it would improve the temperature of the house.\r\nI went to bed at midnight, merely because there was nothing else to do.\r\nI turned on the night lamp at the head of my bed, and picked up a volume\r\nof Shaw at random (it was Arms and the Man, and I remember thinking\r\ngrimly that I was a good bit of a chocolate cream soldier myself),\r\nand prepared to go to sleep. Shaw always puts me to sleep. I have\r\nno apologies to make for what occurred that night, and not even an\r\nexplanation that I am sure of. I did a foolish thing under impulse, and\r\nI have not been sorry.\r\n\r\nIt was something after two when the door-bell rang. It rang quickly,\r\ntwice. I got up drowsily, for the maids and Mrs. Klopton always\r\nlock themselves beyond reach of the bell at night, and put on a\r\ndressing-gown. The bell rang again on my way down-stairs. I lit the hall\r\nlight and opened the door. I was wide-awake now, and I saw that it was\r\nJohnson. His bald head shone in the light--his crooked mouth was twisted\r\nin a smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood Heavens, man,\u201d I said irritably. \u201cDon't you ever go home and go to\r\nbed?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe closed the vestibule door behind him and cavalierly turned out the\r\nlight. Our dialogue was sharp, staccato.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you a key to the empty house next door?\u201d he demanded. \u201cSomebody's\r\nin there, and the latch is caught.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe houses are alike. The key to this door may fit. Did you see them go\r\nin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. There's a light moving up from room to room. I saw something like\r\nit last night, and I have been watching. The patrolman reported queer\r\ndoings there a week or so ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA light!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cDo you mean that you--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery likely,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cHave you a revolver?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll kinds in the gun rack,\u201d I replied, and going into the den, I came\r\nback with a Smith and Wesson. \u201cI'm not much use,\u201d I explained, \u201cwith\r\nthis arm, but I'll do what I can. There may be somebody there. The\r\nservants here have been uneasy.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohnson planned the campaign. He suggested on account of my familiarity\r\nwith the roof, that I go there and cut off escape in that direction. \u201cI\r\nhave Robison out there now--the patrolman on the beat,\u201d he said. \u201cHe'll\r\nwatch below and you above, while I search the house. Be as quiet as\r\npossible.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was rather amused. I put on some clothes and felt my way carefully\r\nup the stairs, the revolver swinging free in my pocket, my hand on the\r\nrail. At the foot of the ladder I stopped and looked up. Above me there\r\nwas a gray rectangle of sky dotted with stars. It occurred to me that\r\nwith my one serviceable hand holding the ladder, I was hardly in a\r\nposition to defend myself, that I was about to hoist a body that I am\r\nrather careful of into a danger I couldn't see and wasn't particularly\r\nkeen about anyhow. I don't mind saying that the seconds it took me to\r\nscramble up the ladder were among the most unpleasant that I recall.\r\n\r\nI got to the top, however, without incident. I could see fairly\r\nwell after the darkness of the house beneath, but there was nothing\r\nsuspicious in sight. The roofs, separated by two feet of brick wall,\r\nstretched around me, unbroken save by an occasional chimney. I went very\r\nsoftly over to the other trap, the one belonging to the suspected house.\r\nIt was closed, but I imagined I could hear Johnson's footsteps ascending\r\nheavily. Then even that was gone. A near-by clock struck three as I\r\nstood waiting. I examined my revolver then, for the first time, and\r\nfound it was empty!\r\n\r\nI had been rather skeptical until now. I had had the usual tolerant\r\nattitude of the man who is summoned from his bed to search for burglars,\r\ncombined with the artificial courage of firearms. With the discovery\r\nof my empty gun, I felt like a man on the top of a volcano in lively\r\neruption. Suddenly I found myself staring incredulously at the trap-door\r\nat my feet. I had examined it early in the evening and found it bolted.\r\nDid I imagine it, or had it raised about an inch? Wasn't it moving\r\nslowly as I looked? No, I am not a hero: I was startled almost into a\r\npanic. I had one arm, and whoever was raising that trap-door had two. My\r\nknees had a queer inclination to bend the wrong way.\r\n\r\nJohnson's footsteps were distinct enough, but he was evidently far\r\nbelow. The trap, raised perhaps two inches now, remained stationary.\r\nThere was no sound from beneath it: once I thought I heard two or three\r\ngasping respirations: I am not sure they were not my own. I wanted\r\ndesperately to stand on one leg at a time and hold the other up out of\r\nfocus of a possible revolver.\r\n\r\nI did not see the hand appear. There was nothing there, and then it was\r\nthere, clutching the frame of the trap. I did the only thing I could\r\nthink of; I put my foot on it!\r\n\r\nThere was not a sound from beneath. The next moment I was kneeling and\r\nhad clutched the wrist just above the hand. After a second's struggle,\r\nthe arm was still. With something real to face, I was myself again.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon't move, or I'll stand on the trap and break your arm,\u201d I panted.\r\nWhat else could I threaten? I couldn't shoot, I couldn't even fight.\r\n\u201cJohnson!\u201d I called.\r\n\r\nAnd then I realized the thing that stayed with me for a month, the thing\r\nI can not think of even now without a shudder. The hand lay ice cold,\r\nstrangely quiescent. Under my fingers, an artery was beating feebly.\r\nThe wrist was as slender as--I held the hand to the light. Then I let it\r\ndrop.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood Lord,\u201d I muttered, and remained on my knees, staring at the spot\r\nwhere the hand had been. It was gone now: there was a faint rustle in\r\nthe darkness below, and then silence.\r\n\r\nI held up my own hand in the starlight and stared at a long scratch\r\nin the palm. \u201cA woman!\u201d I said to myself stupidly. \u201cBy all that's\r\nridiculous, a woman!\u201d\r\n\r\nJohnson was striking matches below and swearing softly to himself. \u201cHow\r\nthe devil do you get to the roof?\u201d he called. \u201cI think I've broken my\r\nnose.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe found the ladder after a short search and stood at the bottom,\r\nlooking up at me. \u201cWell, I suppose you haven't seen him?\u201d he inquired.\r\n\u201cThere are enough darned cubbyholes in this house to hide a patrol\r\nwagon load of thieves.\u201d He lighted a fresh match. \u201cHello, here's another\r\ndoor!\u201d\r\n\r\nBy the sound of his diminishing footsteps I supposed it was a rear\r\nstaircase. He came up again in ten minutes or so, this time with the\r\npoliceman.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe's gone, all right,\u201d he said ruefully. \u201cIf you'd been attending to\r\nyour business, Robison, you'd have watched the back door.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm not twins.\u201d Robison was surly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I broke in, as cheerfully as I could, \u201cif you are through with\r\nthis jolly little affair, and can get down my ladder without having\r\nmy housekeeper ring the burglar alarm, I have some good Monongahela\r\nwhisky--eh?\u201d\r\n\r\nThey came without a second invitation across the roof, and with them\r\nsafely away from the house I breathed more freely. Down in the den I\r\nfulfilled my promise, which Johnson drank to the toast, \u201cComing through\r\nthe rye.\u201d He examined my gun rack with the eye of a connoisseur, and\r\neven when he was about to go he cast a loving eye back at the weapons.\r\n\r\n\u201cEver been in the army?\u201d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said with a bitterness that he noticed but failed to comprehend.\r\n\u201cI'm a chocolate cream soldier--you don't read Shaw, I suppose,\r\nJohnson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever heard of him,\u201d the detective said indifferently. \u201cWell, good\r\nnight, Mr. Blakeley. Much obliged.\u201d At the door he hesitated and\r\ncoughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose you understand, Mr. Blakeley,\u201d he said awkwardly, \u201cthat\r\nthis--er--surveillance is all in the day's work. I don't like it, but\r\nit's duty. Every man to his duty, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSometime when you are in an open mood, Johnson,\u201d I returned, \u201cyou can\r\nexplain why I am being watched at all.\u201d\r\n\nOn Monday I went out for the first time. I did not go to the office. I\r\nwanted to walk. I thought fresh air and exercise would drive away the\r\nblue devils that had me by the throat. McKnight insisted on a long day\r\nin his car, but I refused.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't know why not,\u201d he said sulkily. \u201cI can't walk. I haven't walked\r\ntwo consecutive blocks in three years. Automobiles have made legs mere\r\nornaments--and some not even that. We could have Johnson out there\r\nchasing us over the country at five dollars an hour!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe can chase us just as well at five miles an hour,\u201d I said. \u201cBut what\r\ngets me, McKnight, is why I am under surveillance at all. How do the\r\npolice know I was accused of that thing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe young lady who sent the flowers--she isn't likely to talk, is she?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. That is, I didn't say it was a lady.\u201d I groaned as I tried to get\r\nmy splinted arm into a coat. \u201cAnyhow, she didn't tell,\u201d I finished with\r\nconviction, and McKnight laughed.\r\n\r\nIt had rained in the early morning, and Mrs. Klopton predicted more\r\nshowers. In fact, so firm was her belief and so determined her eye that\r\nI took the umbrella she proffered me.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d I said. \u201cWe can leave it next door; I have a story to tell\r\nyou, Richey, and it requires proper setting.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcKnight was puzzled, but he followed me obediently round to the kitchen\r\nentrance of the empty house. It was unlocked, as I had expected. While\r\nwe climbed to the upper floor I retailed the events of the previous\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's the finest thing I ever heard of,\u201d McKnight said, staring up at\r\nthe ladder and the trap. \u201cWhat a vaudeville skit it would make! Only\r\nyou ought not to have put your foot on her hand. They don't do it in the\r\nbest circles.\u201d\r\n\r\nI wheeled on him impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don't understand the situation at all, Richey!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cWhat\r\nwould you say if I tell you it was the hand of a lady? It was covered\r\nwith rings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA lady!\u201d he repeated. \u201cWhy, I'd say it was a darned compromising\r\nsituation, and that the less you say of it the better. Look here,\r\nLawrence, I think you dreamed it. You've been in the house too much. I\r\ntake it all back: you do need exercise.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe escaped through this door, I suppose,\u201d I said as patiently as I\r\ncould. \u201cEvidently down the back staircase. We might as well go down that\r\nway.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAccording to the best precedents in these affairs, we should find a\r\nglove about here,\u201d he said as we started down. But he was more impressed\r\nthan he cared to own. He examined the dusty steps carefully, and once,\r\nwhen a bit of loose plaster fell just behind him, he started like a\r\nnervous woman.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I don't understand is why you let her go,\u201d he said, stopping once,\r\npuzzled. \u201cYou're not usually quixotic.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen we get out into the country, Richey,\u201d I replied gravely, \u201cI am\r\ngoing to tell you another story, and if you don't tell me I'm a fool and\r\na craven, on the strength of it, you are no friend of mine.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe stumbled through the twilight of the staircase into the blackness\r\nof the shuttered kitchen. The house had the moldy smell of closed\r\nbuildings: even on that warm September morning it was damp and chilly.\r\nAs we stepped into the sunshine McKnight gave a shiver.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow that we are out,\u201d he said, \u201cI don't mind telling you that I have\r\nbeen there before. Do you remember the night you left, and, the face at\r\nthe window?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you speak of it--yes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I was curious about that thing,\u201d he went on, as we started up the\r\nstreet, \u201cand I went back. The street door was unlocked, and I examined\r\nevery room. I was Mrs. Klopton's ghost that carried a light, and clumb.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you find anything?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly a clean place rubbed on the window opposite your dressing-room.\r\nSplendid view of an untidy interior. If that house is ever occupied,\r\nyou'd better put stained glass in that window of yours.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs we turned the corner I glanced back. Half a block behind us Johnson\r\nwas moving our way slowly. When he saw me he stopped and proceeded with\r\ngreat deliberation to light a cigar. By hurrying, however, he caught\r\nthe car that we took, and stood unobtrusively on the rear platform.\r\nHe looked fagged, and absent-mindedly paid our fares, to McKnight's\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will give him a run for his money,\u201d he declared, as the car moved\r\ncountryward. \u201cConductor, let us off at the muddiest lane you can find.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt one o'clock, after a six-mile ramble, we entered a small country\r\nhotel. We had seen nothing of Johnson for a half hour. At that time he\r\nwas a quarter of a mile behind us, and losing rapidly. Before we had\r\nfinished our luncheon he staggered into the inn. One of his boots was\r\nunder his arm, and his whole appearance was deplorable. He was coated\r\nwith mud, streaked with perspiration, and he limped as he walked. He\r\nchose a table not far from us and ordered Scotch. Beyond touching his\r\nhat he paid no attention to us.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm just getting my second wind,\u201d McKnight declared. \u201cHow do you feel,\r\nMr. Johnson? Six or eight miles more and we'll all enjoy our dinners.\u201d\r\n Johnson put down the glass he had raised to his lips without replying.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, however, that I was like Johnson. I was soft from my\r\nweek's inaction, and I was pretty well done up. McKnight, who was a well\r\nspring of vitality and high spirits, ordered a strange concoction, made\r\nof nearly everything in the bar, and sent it over to the detective, but\r\nJohnson refused it.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hate that kind of person,\u201d McKnight said pettishly. \u201cKind of a fellow\r\nthat thinks you're going to poison his dog if you offer him a bone.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen we got back to the car line, with Johnson a draggled and drooping\r\ntail to the kite, I was in better spirits. I had told McKnight the story\r\nof the three hours just after the wreck; I had not named the girl, of\r\ncourse; she had my promise of secrecy. But I told him everything else.\r\nIt was a relief to have a fresh mind on it: I had puzzled so much over\r\nthe incident at the farm-house, and the necklace in the gold bag, that I\r\nhad lost perspective.\r\n\r\nHe had been interested, but inclined to be amused, until I came to the\r\nbroken chain. Then he had whistled softly.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut there are tons of fine gold chains made every year,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy\r\nin the world do you think that the--er--smeary piece came from that\r\nnecklace?\u201d\r\n\r\nI had looked around. Johnson was far behind, scraping the mud off his\r\nfeet with a piece of stick.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have the short end of the chain in the sealskin bag,\u201d I reminded him.\r\n\u201cWhen I couldn't sleep this morning I thought I would settle it, one\r\nway or the other. It was hell to go along the way I had been doing.\r\nAnd--there's no doubt about it, Rich. It's the same chain.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe walked along in silence until we caught the car back to town.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said finally, \u201cyou know the girl, of course, and I don't. But\r\nif you like her--and I think myself you're rather hard hit, old man--I\r\nwouldn't give a whoop about the chain in the gold purse. It's just one\r\nof the little coincidences that hang people now and then. And as for\r\nlast night--if she's the kind of a girl you say she is, and you think\r\nshe had anything to do with that, you--you're addled, that's all. You\r\ncan depend on it, the lady of the empty house last week is the lady\r\nof last night. And yet your train acquaintance was in Altoona at that\r\ntime.\u201d\r\n\r\nJust before we got off the car, I reverted to the subject again. It was\r\nnever far back in my mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout the--young lady of the train, Rich,\u201d I said, with what I suppose\r\nwas elaborate carelessness, \u201cI don't want you to get a wrong impression.\r\nI am rather unlikely to see her again, but even if I do, I--I believe\r\nshe is already 'bespoke,' or next thing to it.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe made no reply, but as I opened the door with my latch-key he stood\r\nlooking up at me from the pavement with his quizzical smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cLove is like the measles,\u201d he orated. \u201cThe older you get it, the worse\r\nthe attack.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohnson did not appear again that day. A small man in a raincoat took\r\nhis place. The next morning I made my initial trip to the office,\r\nthe raincoat still on hand. I had a short conference with Miller, the\r\ndistrict attorney, at eleven. Bronson was under surveillance, he said,\r\nand any attempt to sell the notes to him would probably result in their\r\nrecovery. In the meantime, as I knew, the Commonwealth had continued the\r\ncase, in hope of such contingency.\r\n\r\nAt noon I left the office and took a veterinarian to see Candida, the\r\ninjured pony. By one o'clock my first day's duties were performed, and\r\na long Sahara of hot afternoon stretched ahead. McKnight, always glad\r\nto escape from the grind, suggested a vaudeville, and in sheer ennui\r\nI consented. I could neither ride, drive nor golf, and my own company\r\nbored me to distraction.\r\n\r\n\u201cCoolest place in town these days,\u201d he declared. \u201cElectric fans, breezy\r\nsongs, airy costumes. And there's Johnson just behind--the coldest\r\nproposition in Washington.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe gravely bought three tickets and presented the detective with one.\r\nThen we went in. Having lived a normal, busy life, the theater in the\r\nafternoon is to me about on a par with ice-cream for breakfast. Up on\r\nthe stage a very stout woman in short pink skirts, with a smile that\r\nMcKnight declared looked like a slash in a roll of butter, was singing\r\nnasally, with a laborious kick at the end of each verse. Johnson, two\r\nrows ahead, went to sleep. McKnight prodded me with his elbow.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook at the first box to the right,\u201d he said, in a stage whisper. \u201cI\r\nwant you to come over at the end of this act.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was the first time I had seen her since I put her in the cab at\r\nBaltimore. Outwardly I presume I was calm, for no one turned to stare at\r\nme, but every atom of me cried out at the sight of her. She was leaning,\r\nbent forward, lips slightly parted, gazing raptly at the Japanese\r\nconjurer who had replaced what McKnight disrespectfully called the\r\nColumns of Hercules. Compared with the draggled lady of the farm-house,\r\nshe was radiant.\r\n\r\nFor that first moment there was nothing but joy at the sight of her.\r\nMcKnight's touch on my arm brought me back to reality.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome over and meet them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's the cousin Miss West is\r\nvisiting, Mrs. Dallas.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut I would not go. After he went I sat there alone, painfully conscious\r\nthat I was being pointed out and stared at from the box. The abominable\r\nJapanese gave way to yet more atrocious performing dogs.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow many offers of marriage will the young lady in the box have?\u201d\r\n The dog stopped sagely at 'none,' and then pulled out a card that said\r\neight. Wild shouts of glee by the audience. \u201cThe fools,\u201d I muttered.\r\n\r\nAfter a little I glanced over. Mrs. Dallas was talking to McKnight, but\r\nShe was looking straight at me. She was flushed, but more calm than I,\r\nand she did not bow. I fumbled for my hat, but the next moment I saw\r\nthat they were going, and I sat still. When McKnight came back he was\r\ntriumphant.\r\n\r\n\u201cI've made an engagement for you,\u201d he said. \u201cMrs. Dallas asked me to\r\nbring you to dinner to-night, and I said I knew you would fall all over\r\nyourself to go. You are requested to bring along the broken arm, and any\r\nother souvenirs of the wreck that you may possess.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI'll do nothing of the sort,\u201d I declared, struggling against my\r\ninclination. \u201cI can't even tie my necktie, and I have to have my food\r\ncut for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that's all right,\u201d he said easily. \u201cI'll send Stogie over to fix\r\nyou up, and Mrs. Dal knows all about the arm. I told her.\u201d\r\n\r\n(Stogie is his Japanese factotum, so called because he is lean, a\r\nyellowish brown in color, and because he claims to have been shipped\r\ninto this country in a box.)\r\n\r\nThe Cinematograph was finishing the program. The house was dark and the\r\nmusic had stopped, as it does in the circus just before somebody risks\r\nhis neck at so much a neck in the Dip of Death, or the hundred-foot\r\ndive. Then, with a sort of shock, I saw on the white curtain the\r\nannouncement:\r\n\r\n                         THE NEXT PICTURE\r\n\r\nIS THE DOOMED WASHINGTON FLIER, TAKEN A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE SCENE OF\r\nTHE WRECK ON THE FATAL MORNING OF SEPTEMBER TENTH. TWO MILES FARTHER ON\r\nIT MET WITH ALMOST COMPLETE ANNIHILATION.\r\n\r\nI confess to a return of some of the sickening sensations of the wreck;\r\npeople around me were leaning forward with tense faces. Then the letters\r\nwere gone, and I saw a long level stretch of track, even the broken\r\nstone between the ties standing out distinctly. Far off under a cloud\r\nof smoke a small object was rushing toward us and growing larger as it\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nNow it was on us, a mammoth in size, with huge drivers and a colossal\r\ntender. The engine leaped aside, as if just in time to save us from\r\ndestruction, with a glimpse of a stooping fireman and a grimy engineer.\r\nThe long train of sleepers followed. From a forward vestibule a porter\r\nin a white coat waved his hand. The rest of the cars seemed still\r\nwrapped in slumber. With mixed sensations I saw my own car, Ontario, fly\r\npast, and then I rose to my feet and gripped McKnight's shoulder.\r\n\r\nOn the lowest step at the last car, one foot hanging free, was a man.\r\nHis black derby hat was pulled well down to keep it from blowing away,\r\nand his coat was flying open in the wind. He was swung well out from\r\nthe car, his free hand gripping a small valise, every muscle tense for a\r\njump.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood God, that's my man!\u201d I said hoarsely, as the audience broke into\r\napplause. McKnight half rose: in his seat ahead Johnson stifled a yawn\r\nand turned to eye me.\r\n\r\nI dropped into my chair limply, and tried to control my excitement. \u201cThe\r\nman on the last platform of the train,\u201d I said. \u201cHe was just about to\r\nleap; I'll swear that was my bag.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCould you see his face?\u201d McKnight asked in an undertone. \u201cWould you\r\nknow him again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. His hat was pulled down and his head was bent I'm going back to\r\nfind out where that picture was taken. They say two miles, but it may\r\nhave been forty.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe audience, busy with its wraps, had not noticed. Mrs. Dallas and\r\nAlison West had gone. In front of us Johnson had dropped his hat and was\r\nstooping for it.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis way,\u201d I motioned to McKnight, and we wheeled into the narrow\r\npassage beside us, back of the boxes. At the end there was a door\r\nleading into the wings, and as we went boldly through I turned the key.\r\n\r\nThe final set was being struck, and no one paid any attention to us.\r\nLuckily they were similarly indifferent to a banging at the door I had\r\nlocked, a banging which, I judged, signified Johnson.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess we've broken up his interference,\u201d McKnight chuckled.\r\n\r\nStage hands were hurrying in every direction; pieces of the side wall\r\nof the last drawing-room menaced us; a switchboard behind us was singing\r\nlike a tea-kettle. Everywhere we stepped we were in somebody's way. At\r\nlast we were across, confronting a man in his shirt sleeves, who by dots\r\nand dashes of profanity seemed to be directing the chaos.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d he said, wheeling on us. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would like to ask,\u201d I replied, \u201cif you have any idea just where the\r\nlast cinematograph picture was taken.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBroken board--picnickers--lake?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. The Washington Flier.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe glanced at my bandaged arm.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe announcement says two miles,\u201d McKnight put in, \u201cbut we should like\r\nto know whether it is railroad miles, automobile miles, or policeman\r\nmiles.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sorry I can't tell you,\u201d he replied, more civilly. \u201cWe get those\r\npictures by contract. We don't take them ourselves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere are the company's offices?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNew York.\u201d He stepped forward and grasped a super by the shoulder.\r\n\u201cWhat in blazes are you doing with that gold chair in a kitchen set?\r\nTake that piece of pink plush there and throw it over a soap box, if you\r\nhaven't got a kitchen chair.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had not realized the extent of the shock, but now I dropped into a\r\nchair and wiped my forehead. The unexpected glimpse of Alison West,\r\nfollowed almost immediately by the revelation of the picture, had left\r\nme limp and unnerved. McKnight was looking at his watch.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe says the moving picture people have an office down-town. We can make\r\nit if we go now.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo he called a cab, and we started at a gallop. There was no sign of the\r\ndetective. \u201cUpon my word,\u201d Richey said, \u201cI feel lonely without him.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe people at the down-town office of the cinematograph company were\r\nvery obliging. The picture had been taken, they said, at M-, just\r\ntwo miles beyond the scene of the wreck. It was not much, but it was\r\nsomething to work on. I decided not to go home, but to send McKnight's\r\nJap for my clothes, and to dress at the Incubator. I was determined, if\r\npossible, to make my next day's investigations without Johnson. In the\r\nmeantime, even if it was for the last time, I would see Her that night.\r\nI gave Stogie a note for Mrs. Klopton, and with my dinner clothes there\r\ncame back the gold bag, wrapped in tissue paper.\r\n\nCertain things about the dinner at the Dallas house will always be\r\nobscure to me. Dallas was something in the Fish Commission, and I\r\nremember his reeling off fish eggs in billions while we ate our caviar.\r\nHe had some particular stunt he had been urging the government to\r\nfor years--something about forbidding the establishment of mills and\r\nfactories on river-banks--it seems they kill the fish, either the smoke,\r\nor the noise, or something they pour into the water.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dallas was there, I think. Of course, I suppose she must have been;\r\nand there was a woman in yellow: I took her in to dinner, and I remember\r\nshe loosened my clams for me so I could get them. But the only real\r\nperson at the table was a girl across in white, a sublimated young woman\r\nwho was as brilliant as I was stupid, who never by any chance looked\r\ndirectly at me, and who appeared and disappeared across the candles and\r\norchids in a sort of halo of radiance.\r\n\r\nWhen the dinner had progressed from salmon to roast, and the\r\nconversation had done the same thing--from fish to scandal--the\r\nyellow gown turned to me. \u201cWe have been awfully good, haven't we, Mr.\r\nBlakeley?\u201d she asked. \u201cAlthough I am crazy to hear, I have not said\r\n'wreck' once. I'm sure you must feel like the survivor of Waterloo, or\r\nsomething of the sort.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you want me to tell you about the wreck,\u201d I said, glancing across\r\nthe table, \u201cI'm sorry to be disappointing, but I don't remember\r\nanything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are fortunate to be able to forget it.\u201d It was the first word Miss\r\nWest had spoken directly to me, and it went to my head.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are some things I have not forgotten,\u201d I said, over the candles.\r\n\u201cI recall coming to myself some time after, and that a girl, a beautiful\r\ngirl--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said the lady in yellow, leaning forward breathlessly. Miss West\r\nwas staring at me coldly, but, once started, I had to stumble on.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat a girl was trying to rouse me, and that she told me I had been on\r\nfire twice already.\u201d A shudder went around the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut surely that isn't the end of the story,\u201d Mrs. Dallas put in\r\naggrievedly. \u201cWhy, that's the most tantalizing thing I ever heard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm afraid that's all,\u201d I said. \u201cShe went her way and I went mine.\r\nIf she recalls me at all, she probably thinks of me as a weak-kneed\r\nindividual who faints like a woman when everything is over.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d Mrs. Dallas asserted triumphantly. \u201cHe fainted,\r\ndid you hear? when everything was over! He hasn't begun to tell it.\u201d\r\n\r\nI would have given a lot by that time if I had not mentioned the girl.\r\nBut McKnight took it up there and carried it on.\r\n\r\n\u201cBlakeley is a regular geyser,\u201d he said. \u201cHe never spouts until he\r\nreaches the boiling point. And by that same token, although he hasn't\r\nsaid much about the Lady of the Wreck, I think he is crazy about her. In\r\nfact, I am sure of it. He thinks he has locked his secret in the caves\r\nof his soul, but I call you to witness that he has it nailed to his\r\nface. Look at him!\u201d\r\n\r\nI squirmed miserably and tried to avoid the startled eyes of the girl\r\nacross the table. I wanted to choke McKnight and murder the rest of the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt isn't fair,\u201d I said as coolly as I could. \u201cI have my fingers\r\ncrossed; you are five against one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd to think that there was a murder on that very train,\u201d broke in the\r\nlady in yellow. \u201cIt was a perfect crescendo of horrors, wasn't it? And\r\nwhat became of the murdered man, Mr. Blakeley?\u201d\r\n\r\nMcKnight had the sense to jump into the conversation and save my reply.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey say good Pittsburgers go to Atlantic City when they die,\u201d he\r\nsaid. \u201cSo--we are reasonably certain the gentleman did not go to the\r\nseashore.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe meal was over at last, and once in the drawing-room it was clear\r\nwe hung heavy on the hostess' hands. \u201cIt is so hard to get people for\r\nbridge in September,\u201d she wailed, \u201cthere is absolutely nobody in town.\r\nSix is a dreadful number.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's a good poker number,\u201d her husband suggested.\r\n\r\nThe matter settled itself, however. I was hopeless, save as a dummy;\r\nMiss West said it was too hot for cards, and went out on a balcony that\r\noverlooked the Mall. With obvious relief Mrs. Dallas had the card-table\r\nbrought, and I was face to face with the minute I had dreaded and hoped\r\nfor for a week.\r\n\r\nNow it had come, it was more difficult than I had anticipated. I do not\r\nknow if there was a moon, but there was the urban substitute for it--the\r\narc light. It threw the shadow of the balcony railing in long black bars\r\nagainst her white gown, and as it swung sometimes her face was in the\r\nlight. I drew a chair close so that I could watch her.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know,\u201d I said, when she made no effort at speech, \u201cthat you are\r\na much more formidable person to-night, in that gown, than you were the\r\nlast time I saw you?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe light swung on her face; she was smiling faintly. \u201cThe hat with the\r\ngreen ribbons!\u201d she said. \u201cI must take it back; I had almost forgotten.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have not forgotten--anything.\u201d I pulled myself up short. This was\r\nhardly loyalty to Richey. His voice came through the window just then,\r\nand perhaps I was wrong, but I thought she raised her head to listen.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook at this hand,\u201d he was saying. \u201cRegular pianola: you could play it\r\nwith your feet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe's a dear, isn't he?\u201d Alison said unexpectedly. \u201cNo matter how\r\ndepressed and downhearted I am, I always cheer up when I see Richey.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe's more than that,\u201d I returned warmly. \u201cHe is the most honorable\r\nfellow I know. If he wasn't so much that way, he would have a career\r\nbefore him. He wanted to put on the doors of our offices, Blakeley and\r\nMcKnight, P. B. H., which is Poor But Honest.\u201d\r\n\r\nFrom my comparative poverty to the wealth of the girl beside me was\r\na single mental leap. From that wealth to the grandfather who was\r\nresponsible for it was another.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder if you know that I had been to Pittsburg to see your\r\ngrandfather when I met you?\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou?\u201d She was surprised.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. And you remember the alligator bag that I told you was exchanged\r\nfor the one you cut off my arm?\u201d She nodded expectantly. \u201cWell, in that\r\nvalise were the forged Andy Bronson notes, and Mr. Gilmore's deposition\r\nthat they were forged.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was on her feet in an instant. \u201cIn that bag!\u201d she cried. \u201cOh, why\r\ndidn't you tell me that before? Oh, it's so ridiculous, so--so hopeless.\r\nWhy, I could--\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stopped suddenly and sat down again. \u201cI do not know that I am sorry,\r\nafter all,\u201d she said after a pause. \u201cMr. Bronson was a friend of my\r\nfather's. I--I suppose it was a bad thing for you, losing the papers?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it was not a good thing,\u201d I conceded. \u201cWhile we are on the\r\nsubject of losing things, do you remember--do you know that I still have\r\nyour gold purse?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe did not reply at once. The shadow of a column was over her face, but\r\nI guessed that she was staring at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have it!\u201d She almost whispered.\r\n\r\n\u201cI picked it up in the street car,\u201d I said, with a cheerfulness I did\r\nnot feel. \u201cIt looks like a very opulent little purse.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhy didn't she speak about the necklace? For just a careless word to\r\nmake me sane again!\r\n\r\n\u201cYou!\u201d she repeated, horror-stricken. And then I produced the purse and\r\nheld it out on my palm. \u201cI should have sent it to you before, I suppose,\r\nbut, as you know, I have been laid up since the wreck.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe both saw McKnight at the same moment. He had pulled the curtains\r\naside and was standing looking out at us. The tableau of give and\r\ntake was unmistakable; the gold purse, her outstretched hand, my own\r\nattitude. It was over in a second; then he came out and lounged on the\r\nbalcony railing.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey're mad at me in there,\u201d he said airily, \u201cso I came out. I suppose\r\nthe reason they call it bridge is because so many people get cross over\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe heat broke up the card group soon after, and they all came out for\r\nthe night breeze. I had no more words alone with Alison.\r\n\r\nI went back to the Incubator for the night. We said almost nothing on\r\nthe way home; there was a constraint between us for the first time that\r\nI could remember. It was too early for bed, and so we smoked in the\r\nliving-room and tried to talk of trivial things. After a time even those\r\nfailed, and we sat silent. It was McKnight who finally broached the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so she wasn't at Seal Harbor at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know where she was, Lollie?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSomewhere near Cresson.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that was the purse--her purse--with the broken necklace in it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it was. You understand, don't you, Rich, that, having given her my\r\nword, I couldn't tell you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI understand a lot of things,\u201d he said, without bitterness.\r\n\r\nWe sat for some time and smoked. Then Richey got up and stretched\r\nhimself. \u201cI'm off to bed, old man,\u201d he said. \u201cNeed any help with that\r\ngame arm of yours?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d I returned.\r\n\r\nI heard him go into his room and lock the door. It was a bad hour for\r\nme. The first shadow between us, and the shadow of a girl at that.\r\n\nMcKnight is always a sympathizer with the early worm. It was late when\r\nhe appeared. Perhaps, like myself, he had not slept well. But he was\r\napparently cheerful enough, and he made a better breakfast than I did.\r\nIt was one o'clock before we got to Baltimore. After a half hour's wait\r\nwe took a local for M-, the station near which the cinematograph picture\r\nhad been taken.\r\n\r\nWe passed the scene of the wreck, McKnight with curiosity, I with a\r\nsickening sense of horror. Back in the fields was the little farm-house\r\nwhere Alison West and I had intended getting coffee, and winding away\r\nfrom the track, maple trees shading it on each side, was the lane where\r\nwe had stopped to rest, and where I had--it seemed presumption beyond\r\nbelief now--where I had tried to comfort her by patting her hand.\r\n\r\nWe got out at M-, a small place with two or three houses and a general\r\nstore. The station was a one-roomed affair, with a railed-off place at\r\nthe end, where a scale, a telegraph instrument and a chair constituted\r\nthe entire furnishing.\r\n\r\nThe station agent was a young man with a shrewd face. He stopped\r\nhammering a piece of wood over a hole in the floor to ask where we\r\nwanted to go.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe're not going,\u201d said McKnight, \u201cwe're coming. Have a cigar?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe agent took it with an inquiring glance, first at it and then at us.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe want to ask you a few questions,\u201d began McKnight, perching himself\r\non the railing and kicking the chair forward for me. \u201cOr, rather, this\r\ngentleman does.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d said the agent, glancing through the window. \u201cThere's a\r\nhen in that crate choking herself to death.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was back in a minute, and took up his position near a sawdust-filled\r\nbox that did duty as a cuspidor.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow fire away,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the first place,\u201d I began, \u201cdo you remember the day the Washington\r\nFlier was wrecked below here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo I!\u201d he said. \u201cDid Jonah remember the whale?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWere you on the platform here when the first section passed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you recall seeing a man hanging to the platform of the last car?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was no one hanging there when she passed here,\u201d he said with\r\nconviction. \u201cI watched her out of sight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you see anything that morning of a man about my size, carrying a\r\nsmall grip, and wearing dark clothes and a derby hat?\u201d I asked eagerly.\r\n\r\nMcKnight was trying to look unconcerned, but I was frankly anxious. It\r\nwas clear that the man had jumped somewhere in the mile of track just\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, yes, I did.\u201d The agent cleared his throat. \u201cWhen the smash came\r\nthe operator at MX sent word along the wire, both ways. I got it here,\r\nand I was pretty near crazy, though I knew it wasn't any fault of mine.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was standing on the track looking down, for I couldn't leave the\r\noffice, when a young fellow with light hair limped up to me and asked me\r\nwhat that smoke was over there.\r\n\r\n\u201c'That's what's left of the Washington Flier,' I said, 'and I guess\r\nthere's souls going up in that smoke.'\r\n\r\n\u201c'Do you mean the first section?' he said, getting kind of\r\ngreenish-yellow.\r\n\r\n\u201c'That's what I mean,' I said; 'split to kindling wood because Rafferty,\r\non the second section, didn't want to be late.'\r\n\r\n\u201cHe put his hand out in front of him, and the satchel fell with a bang.\r\n\r\n\u201c'My God!' he said, and dropped right on the track in a heap.\r\n\r\n\u201cI got him into the station and he came around, but he kept on groaning\r\nsomething awful. He'd sprained his ankle, and when he got a little\r\nbetter I drove him over in Carter's milk wagon to the Carter place, and\r\nI reckon he stayed there a spell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat's all, is it?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat's all--or, no, there's something else. About noon that day one\r\nof the Carter twins came down with a note from him asking me to send a\r\nlong-distance message to some one in Washington.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo whom?\u201d I asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI reckon I've forgot the name, but the message was that this\r\nfellow--Sullivan was his name--was at M-, and if the man had escaped\r\nfrom the wreck would he come to see him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe wouldn't have sent that message to me,\u201d I said to McKnight, rather\r\ncrestfallen. \u201cHe'd have every object in keeping out of my way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere might be reasons,\u201d McKnight observed judicially. \u201cHe might not\r\nhave found the papers then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas the name Blakeley?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt might have been--I can't say. But the man wasn't there, and there\r\nwas a lot of noise. I couldn't hear well. Then in half an hour down came\r\nthe other twin to say the gentleman was taking on awful and didn't want\r\nthe message sent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe's gone, of course?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Limped down here in about three days and took the noon train for\r\nthe city.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt seemed a certainty now that our man, having hurt himself somewhat\r\nin his jump, had stayed quietly in the farm-house until he was able to\r\ntravel. But, to be positive, we decided to visit the Carter place.\r\n\r\nI gave the station agent a five-dollar bill, which he rolled up with a\r\ncouple of others and stuck in his pocket. I turned as we got to a bend\r\nin the road, and he was looking curiously after us.\r\n\r\nIt was not until we had climbed the hill and turned onto the road to the\r\nCarter place that I realized where we were going. Although we approached\r\nit from another direction, I knew the farm-house at once. It was the one\r\nwhere Alison West and I had breakfasted nine days before. With the new\r\nrestraint between us, I did not tell McKnight. I wondered afterward if\r\nhe had suspected it. I saw him looking hard at the gate-post which had\r\nfigured in one of our mysteries, but he asked no questions. Afterward he\r\ngrew almost taciturn, for him, and let me do most of the talking.\r\n\r\nWe opened the front gate of the Carter place and went slowly up the\r\nwalk. Two ragged youngsters, alike even to freckles and squints, were\r\nplaying in the yard.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs your mother around?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the front room. Walk in,\u201d they answered in identical tones.\r\n\r\nAs we got to the porch we heard voices, and stopped. I knocked, but the\r\npeople within, engaged in animated, rather one-sided conversation, did\r\nnot answer.\r\n\r\n\u201c'In the front room. Walk in,'\u201d quoted McKnight, and did so.\r\n\r\nIn the stuffy farm parlor two people were sitting. One, a pleasant-faced\r\nwoman with a checked apron, rose, somewhat embarrassed, to meet us. She\r\ndid not know me, and I was thankful. But our attention was riveted on\r\na little man who was sitting before a table, writing busily. It was\r\nHotchkiss!\r\n\r\nHe got up when he saw us, and had the grace to look uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuch an interesting case,\u201d he said nervously, \u201cI took the liberty--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here,\u201d said McKnight suddenly, \u201cdid you make any inquiries at the\r\nstation?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA few,\u201d he confessed. \u201cI went to the theater last night--I felt\r\nthe need of a little relaxation--and the sight of a picture there, a\r\ncinematograph affair, started a new line of thought. Probably the\r\nsame clue brought you gentlemen. I learned a good bit from the station\r\nagent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe son-of-a-gun,\u201d said McKnight. \u201cAnd you paid him, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI gave him five dollars,\u201d was the apologetic answer. Mrs. Carter,\r\nhearing sounds of strife in the yard, went out, and Hotchkiss folded up\r\nhis papers.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think the identity of the man is established,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat number\r\nof hat do you wear, Mr. Blakeley?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSeven and a quarter,\u201d I replied.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it's only piling up evidence,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cOn the night\r\nof the murder you wore light gray silk underclothing, with the second\r\nbutton of the shirt missing. Your hat had 'L. B.' in gilt letters\r\ninside, and there was a very minute hole in the toe of one black sock.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHush,\u201d McKnight protested. \u201cIf word gets to Mrs. Klopton that Mr.\r\nBlakeley was wrecked, or robbed, or whatever it was, with a button\r\nmissing and a hole in one sock, she'll retire to the Old Ladies' Home.\r\nI've heard her threaten it.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Hotchkiss was without a sense of humor. He regarded McKnight gravely\r\nand went on:\r\n\r\n\u201cI've been up in the room where the man lay while he was unable to get\r\naway, and there is nothing there. But I found what may be a possible\r\nclue in the dust heap.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Carter tells me that in unpacking his grip the other day she took\r\nout of the coat of the pajamas some pieces of a telegram. As I figure\r\nit, the pajamas were his own. He probably had them on when he effected\r\nthe exchange.\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded assent. All I had retained of my own clothing was the suit of\r\npajamas I was wearing and my bath-robe.\r\n\r\n\u201cTherefore the telegram was his, not yours. I have pieces here, but some\r\nare missing. I am not discouraged, however.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe spread out some bits of yellow paper, and we bent over them\r\ncuriously. It was something like this:\r\n\r\n              Man with p-    Get-\r\n                              Br-\r\n\r\nWe spelled it out slowly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d Hotchkiss announced, \u201cI make it something like this: The 'p.-' is\r\none of two things, pistol--you remember the little pearl-handled affair\r\nbelonging to the murdered man--or it is pocket-book. I am inclined to\r\nthe latter view, as the pocket-book had been disturbed and the pistol\r\nhad not.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took the piece of paper from the table and scrawled four words on it.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d I said, rearranging them, \u201cit happens, Mr. Hotchkiss, that I\r\nfound one of these pieces of the telegram on the train. I thought it had\r\nbeen dropped by some one else, you see, but that's immaterial. Arranged\r\nthis way it almost makes sense. Fill out that 'p.-' with the rest of the\r\nword, as I imagine it, and it makes 'papers,' and add this scrap and you\r\nhave:\r\n\r\n\u201c'Man with papers (in) lower ten, car seven. Get (them).'\r\n\r\nMcKnight slapped Hotchkiss on the back. \u201cYou're a trump,\u201d he said. \u201cBr-\r\nis Bronson, of course. It's almost too easy. You see, Mr. Blakeley\r\nhere engaged lower ten, but found it occupied by the man who was later\r\nmurdered there. The man who did the thing was a friend of Bronson's,\r\nevidently, and in trying to get the papers we have the motive for the\r\ncrime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are still some things to be explained.\u201d Mr. Hotchkiss wiped his\r\nglasses and put them on. \u201cFor one thing, Mr. Blakeley, I am puzzled by\r\nthat bit of chain.\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not glance at McKnight. I felt that the hand, with which I was\r\ngathering up the bits of torn paper were shaking. It seemed to me that\r\nthis astute little man was going to drag in the girl in spite of me.\r\n\nHotchkiss jotted down the bits of telegram and rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cwe've done something. We've found where the murderer\r\nleft the train, we know what day he went to Baltimore, and, most\r\nimportant of all, we have a motive for the crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems the irony of fate,\u201d said McKnight, getting up, \u201cthat a\r\nman should kill another man for certain papers he is supposed to be\r\ncarrying, find he hasn't got them after all, decide to throw suspicion\r\non another man by changing berths and getting out, bag and baggage, and\r\nthen, by the merest fluke of chance, take with him, in the valise he\r\nchanged for his own, the very notes he was after. It was a bit of luck\r\nfor him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen why,\u201d put in Hotchkiss doubtfully, \u201cwhy did he collapse when he\r\nheard of the wreck? And what about the telephone message the station\r\nagent sent? You remember they tried to countermand it, and with some\r\nexcitement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will ask him those questions when we get him,\u201d McKnight said. We\r\nwere on the unrailed front porch by that time, and Hotchkiss had put\r\naway his notebook. The mother of the twins followed us to the steps.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me,\u201d she exclaimed volubly, \u201cand to think I was forgetting to tell\r\nyou! I put the young man to bed with a spice poultice on his ankle: my\r\nmother always was a firm believer in spice poultices. It's wonderful\r\nwhat they will do in croup! And then I took the children and went down\r\nto see the wreck. It was Sunday, and the mister had gone to church;\r\nhasn't missed a day since he took the pledge nine years ago. And on the\r\nway I met two people, a man and a woman. They looked half dead, so I\r\nsent them right here for breakfast and some soap and water. I always say\r\nsoap is better than liquor after a shock.\u201d\r\n\r\nHotchkiss was listening absently: McKnight was whistling under his\r\nbreath, staring down across the field to where a break in the woods\r\nshowed a half dozen telegraph poles, the line of the railroad.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must have been twelve o'clock when we got back; I wanted the\r\nchildren to see everything, because it isn't likely they'll ever see\r\nanother wreck like that. Rows of--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout twelve o'clock,\u201d I broke in, \u201cand what then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe young man up-stairs was awake,\u201d she went on, \u201cand hammering at his\r\ndoor like all possessed. And it was locked on the outside!\u201d She paused\r\nto enjoy her sensation.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would like to see that lock,\u201d Hotchkiss said promptly, but for some\r\nreason the woman demurred.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will bring the key down,\u201d she said and disappeared. When she returned\r\nshe held out an ordinary door key of the cheapest variety.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe had to break the lock,\u201d she volunteered, \u201cand the key didn't turn up\r\nfor two days. Then one of the twins found the turkey gobbler trying to\r\nswallow it. It has been washed since,\u201d she hastened to assure Hotchkiss,\r\nwho showed an inclination to drop it.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don't think he locked the door himself and threw the key out of the\r\nwindow?\u201d the little man asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe windows are covered with mosquito netting, nailed on. The mister\r\nblamed it on the children, and it might have been Obadiah. He's the\r\nquiet kind, and you never know what he's about.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe's about to strangle, isn't he,\u201d McKnight remarked lazily, \u201cor is\r\nthat Obadiah?\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Carter picked the boy up and inverted him, talking amiably all the\r\ntime. \u201cHe's always doing it,\u201d she said, giving him a shake. \u201cWhenever we\r\nmiss anything we look to see if Obadiah's black in the face.\u201d She gave\r\nhim another shake, and the quarter I had given him shot out as if blown\r\nfrom a gun. Then we prepared to go back to the station.\r\n\r\nFrom where I stood I could look into the cheery farm kitchen, where\r\nAlison West and I had eaten our al fresco breakfast. I looked at the\r\ntable with mixed emotions, and then, gradually, the meaning of something\r\non it penetrated my mind. Still in its papers, evidently just opened,\r\nwas a hat box, and protruding over the edge of the box was a streamer of\r\nvivid green ribbon.\r\n\r\nOn the plea that I wished to ask Mrs. Carter a few more questions, I let\r\nthe others go on. I watched them down the flagstone walk; saw McKnight\r\nstop and examine the gate-posts and saw, too, the quick glance he threw\r\nback at the house. Then I turned to Mrs. Carter.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would like to speak to the young lady up-stairs,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\nShe threw up her hands with a quick gesture of surrender. \u201cI've done all\r\nI could,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cShe won't like it very well, but--she's in the\r\nroom over the parlor.\u201d\r\n\r\nI went eagerly up the ladder-like stairs, to the rag-carpeted hall. Two\r\ndoors were open, showing interiors of four poster beds and high bureaus.\r\nThe door of the room over the parlor was almost closed. I hesitated\r\nin the hallway: after all, what right had I to intrude on her? But she\r\nsettled my difficulty by throwing open the door and facing me.\r\n\r\n\u201cI--I beg your pardon, Miss West,\u201d I stammered. \u201cIt has just occurred\r\nto me that I am unpardonably rude. I saw the hat down-stairs and I--I\r\nguessed--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe hat!\u201d she said. \u201cI might have known. Does Richey know I am here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't think so.\u201d I turned to go down the stairs again. Then I halted.\r\n\u201cThe fact is,\u201d I said, in an attempt at justification, \u201cI'm in rather\r\na mess these days, and I'm apt to do irresponsible things. It is not\r\nimpossible that I shall be arrested, in a day or so, for the murder of\r\nSimon Harrington.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe drew her breath in sharply. \u201cMurder!\u201d she echoed. \u201cThen they have\r\nfound you after all!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't regard it as anything more than--er--inconvenient,\u201d I lied.\r\n\u201cThey can't convict me, you know. Almost all the witnesses are dead.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was not deceived for a moment. She came over to me and stood, both\r\nhands on the rail of the stair. \u201cI know just how grave it is,\u201d she said\r\nquietly. \u201cMy grandfather will not leave one stone unturned, and he can\r\nbe terrible--terrible. But\u201d--she looked directly into my eyes as I stood\r\nbelow her on the stairs--\u201cthe time may come--soon--when I can help you.\r\nI'm afraid I shall not want to; I'm a dreadful coward, Mr. Blakeley.\r\nBut--I will.\u201d She tried to smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish you would let me help you,\u201d I said unsteadily. \u201cLet us make it a\r\nbargain: each help the other!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl shook her head with a sad little smile. \u201cI am only as unhappy\r\nas I deserve to be,\u201d she said. And when I protested and took a step\r\ntoward her she retreated, with her hands out before her.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy don't you ask me all the questions you are thinking?\u201d she demanded,\r\nwith a catch in her voice. \u201cOh, I know them. Or are you afraid to ask?\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked at her, at the lines around her eyes, at the drawn look about\r\nher mouth. Then I held out my hand. \u201cAfraid!\u201d I said, as she gave me\r\nhers. \u201cThere is nothing in God's green earth I am afraid of, save of\r\ntrouble for you. To ask questions would be to imply a lack of faith. I\r\nask you nothing. Some day, perhaps, you will come to me yourself and let\r\nme help you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe next moment I was out in the golden sunshine: the birds were singing\r\ncarols of joy: I walked dizzily through rainbow-colored clouds, past the\r\ntwins, cherubs now, swinging on the gate. It was a new world into which\r\nI stepped from the Carter farm-house that morning, for--I had kissed\r\nher!\r\n\nMcKnight and Hotchkiss were sauntering slowly down the road as I caught\r\nup with them. As usual, the little man was busy with some abstruse\r\nmental problem.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe idea is this,\u201d he was saying, his brows knitted in thought, \u201cif\r\na left-handed man, standing in the position of the man in the picture,\r\nshould jump from a car, would he be likely to sprain his right ankle?\r\nWhen a right-handed man prepares for a leap of that kind, my theory\r\nis that he would hold on with his right hand, and alight at the proper\r\ntime, on his right foot. Of course--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI imagine, although I don't know,\u201d interrupted McKnight, \u201cthat a man\r\neither ambidextrous or one-armed, jumping from the Washington Flier,\r\nwould be more likely to land on his head.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnyhow,\u201d I interposed, \u201cwhat difference does it make whether Sullivan\r\nused one hand or the other? One pair of handcuffs will put both hands\r\nout of commission.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs usual when one of his pet theories was attacked, Hotchkiss looked\r\naggrieved.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear sir,\u201d he expostulated, \u201cdon't you understand what bearing this\r\nhas on the case? How was the murdered man lying when he was found?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn his back,\u201d I said promptly, \u201chead toward the engine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d he retorted, \u201cand what then? Your heart lies under your\r\nfifth intercostal space, and to reach it a right-handed blow would have\r\nstruck either down or directly in.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, gentleman, the point of entrance for the stiletto was below the\r\nheart, striking up! As Harrington lay with his head toward the engine, a\r\nperson in the aisle must have used the left hand.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcKnight's eyes sought mine and he winked at me solemnly as I\r\nunostentatiously transferred the hat I was carrying to my right hand.\r\nLong training has largely counterbalanced heredity in my case, but I\r\nstill pitch ball, play tennis and carve with my left hand. But Hotchkiss\r\nwas too busy with his theories to notice me.\r\n\r\nWe were only just in time for our train back to Baltimore, but McKnight\r\ntook advantage of a second's delay to shake the station agent warmly by\r\nthe hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to express my admiration for you,\u201d he said beamingly. \u201cAbility\r\nof your order is thrown away here. You should have been a city\r\npoliceman, my friend.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe agent looked a trifle uncertain.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe young lady was the one who told me to keep still,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nMcKnight glanced at me, gave the agent's hand a final shake, and climbed\r\non board. But I knew perfectly that he had guessed the reason for my\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nHe was very silent on the way home. Hotchkiss, too, had little to say.\r\nHe was reading over his notes intently, stopping now and then to make a\r\npenciled addition. Just before we left the train Richey turned to me. \u201cI\r\nsuppose it was the key to the door that she tied to the gate?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cProbably. I did not ask her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCurious, her locking that fellow in,\u201d he reflected.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may depend on it, there was a good reason for it all. And I wish\r\nyou wouldn't be so suspicious of motives, Rich,\u201d I said warmly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly yesterday you were the suspicious one,\u201d he retorted, and we lapsed\r\ninto strained silence.\r\n\r\nIt was late when we got to Washington. One of Mrs. Klopton's small\r\ntyrannies was exacting punctuality at meals, and, like several other\r\nthings, I respected it. There are always some concessions that should be\r\nmade in return for faithful service.\r\n\r\nSo, as my dinner hour of seven was long past, McKnight and I went to a\r\nlittle restaurant down town where they have a very decent way of fixing\r\nchicken a la King. Hotchkiss had departed, economically bent, for a\r\nsmall hotel where he lived on the American plan.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to think some things over,\u201d he said in response to my invitation\r\nto dinner, \u201cand, anyhow, there's no use dining out when I pay the same,\r\ndinner or no dinner, where I am stopping.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe day had been hot, and the first floor dining-room was sultry in\r\nspite of the palms and fans which attempted to simulate the verdure and\r\nbreezes of the country.\r\n\r\nIt was crowded, too, with a typical summer night crowd, and, after\r\nsitting for a few minutes in a sweltering corner, we got up and went\r\nto the smaller dining-room up-stairs. Here it was not so warm, and we\r\nsettled ourselves comfortably by a window.\r\n\r\nOver in a corner half a dozen boys on their way back to school were\r\nragging a perspiring waiter, a proceeding so exactly to McKnight's taste\r\nthat he insisted on going over to join them. But their table was full,\r\nand somehow that kind of fun had lost its point for me.\r\n\r\nNot far from us a very stout, middle-aged man, apoplectic with the heat,\r\nwas elephantinely jolly for the benefit of a bored-looking girl across\r\nthe table from him, and at the next table a newspaper woman ate alone,\r\nthe last edition propped against the water-bottle before her, her hat,\r\nfor coolness, on the corner of the table. It was a motley Bohemian\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\nI looked over the room casually, while McKnight ordered the meal. Then\r\nmy attention was attracted to the table next to ours. Two people were\r\nsitting there, so deep in conversation that they did not notice us. The\r\nwoman's face was hidden under her hat, as she traced the pattern of the\r\ncloth mechanically with her fork. But the man's features stood out clear\r\nin the light of the candles on the table. It was Bronson!\r\n\r\n\u201cHe shows the strain, doesn't he?\u201d McKnight said, holding up the wine\r\nlist as if he read from it. \u201cWho's the woman?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSearch me,\u201d I replied, in the same way.\r\n\r\nWhen the chicken came, I still found myself gazing now and then at the\r\nabstracted couple near me. Evidently the subject of conversation was\r\nunpleasant. Bronson was eating little, the woman not at all. Finally he\r\ngot up, pushed his chair back noisily, thrust a bill at the waiter and\r\nstalked out.\r\n\r\nThe woman sat still for a moment; then, with an apparent resolution to\r\nmake the best of it, she began slowly to eat the meal before her.\r\n\r\nBut the quarrel had taken away her appetite, for the mixture in our\r\nchafing-dish was hardly ready to serve before she pushed her chair back\r\na little and looked around the room.\r\n\r\nI caught my first glimpse of her face then, and I confess it startled\r\nme. It was the tall, stately woman of the Ontario, the woman I had\r\nlast seen cowering beside the road, rolling pebbles in her hand, blood\r\nstreaming from a cut over her eye. I could see the scar now, a little\r\naffair, about an inch long, gleaming red through its layers of powder.\r\n\r\nAnd then, quite unexpectedly, she turned and looked directly at me.\r\nAfter a minute's uncertainty, she bowed, letting her eyes rest on mine\r\nwith a calmly insolent stare. She glanced at McKnight for a moment, then\r\nback to me. When she looked away again I breathed easier.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d asked McKnight under his breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cOntario.\u201d I formed it with my lips rather than said it. McKnight's\r\neyebrows went up and he looked with increased interest at the\r\nblack-gowned figure.\r\n\r\nI ate little after that. The situation was rather bad for me, I began to\r\nsee. Here was a woman who could, if she wished, and had any motive for\r\nso doing, put me in jail under a capital charge. A word from her to the\r\npolice, and polite surveillance would become active interference.\r\n\r\nThen, too, she could say that she had seen me, just after the wreck,\r\nwith a young woman from the murdered man's car, and thus probably bring\r\nAlison West into the case.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, then, that I ate little. The woman across seemed\r\nin no hurry to go. She loitered over a demi-tasse, and that finished,\r\nsat with her elbow on the table, her chin in her hand, looking darkly at\r\nthe changing groups in the room.\r\n\r\nThe fun at the table where the college boys sat began to grow a little\r\nnoisy; the fat man, now a purplish shade, ambled away behind his slim\r\ncompanion; the newspaper woman pinned on her business-like hat and\r\nstalked out. Still the woman at the next table waited.\r\n\r\nIt was a relief when the meal was over. We got our hats and were about\r\nto leave the room, when a waiter touched me on the arm.\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon, sir,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the lady at the table near the\r\nwindow, the lady in black, sir, would like to speak to you.\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked down between the rows of tables to where the woman sat alone,\r\nher chin still resting on her hand, her black eyes still insolently\r\nstaring, this time at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'll have to go,\u201d I said to McKnight hurriedly. \u201cShe knows all about\r\nthat affair and she'd be a bad enemy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't like her lamps,\u201d McKnight observed, after a glance at her.\r\n\u201cBetter jolly her a little. Good-by.\u201d\r\n\nI went back slowly to where the woman sat alone.\r\n\r\nShe smiled rather oddly as I drew near, and pointed to the chair Bronson\r\nhad vacated.\r\n\r\n\u201cSit down, Mr. Blakeley,\u201d she said, \u201cI am going to take a few minutes of\r\nyour valuable time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d I sat down opposite her and glanced at a cuckoo clock on\r\nthe wall. \u201cI am sorry, but I have only a few minutes. If you--\u201d She\r\nlaughed a little, not very pleasantly, and opening a small black fan\r\ncovered with spangles, waved it slowly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe fact is,\u201d she said, \u201cI think we are about to make a bargain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA bargain?\u201d I asked incredulously. \u201cYou have a second advantage of me.\r\nYou know my name\u201d--I paused suggestively and she took the cue.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Mrs. Conway,\u201d she said, and flicked a crumb off the table with an\r\nover-manicured finger.\r\n\r\nThe name was scarcely a surprise. I had already surmised that this might\r\nbe the woman whom rumor credited as being Bronson's common-law wife.\r\nRumor, I remembered, had said other things even less pleasant, things\r\nwhich had been brought out at Bronson's arrest for forgery.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe met last under less fortunate circumstances,\u201d she was saying. \u201cI\r\nhave been fit for nothing since that terrible day. And you--you had a\r\nbroken arm, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI still have it,\u201d I said, with a lame attempt at jocularity; \u201cbut to\r\nhave escaped at all was a miracle. We have much, indeed, to be thankful\r\nfor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose we have,\u201d she said carelessly, \u201calthough sometimes I doubt\r\nit.\u201d She was looking somberly toward the door through which her late\r\ncompanion had made his exit.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou sent for me--\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I sent for you.\u201d She roused herself and sat erect. \u201cNow, Mr.\r\nBlakeley, have you found those papers?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe papers? What papers?\u201d I parried. I needed time to think.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Blakeley,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cI think we can lay aside all\r\nsubterfuge. In the first place let me refresh your mind about a few\r\nthings. The Pittsburg police are looking for the survivors of the car\r\nOntario; there are three that I know of--yourself, the young woman with\r\nwhom you left the scene of the wreck, and myself. The wreck, you will\r\nadmit, was a fortunate one for you.\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded without speaking.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the time of the collision you were in rather a hole,\u201d she went\r\non, looking at me with a disagreeable smile. \u201cYou were, if I remember,\r\naccused of a rather atrocious crime. There was a lot of corroborative\r\nevidence, was there not? I seem to remember a dirk and the murdered\r\nman's pocket-book in your possession, and a few other things that\r\nwere--well, rather unpleasant.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was thrown a bit off my guard.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou remember also,\u201d I said quickly, \u201cthat a man disappeared from the\r\ncar, taking my clothes, papers and everything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI remember that you said so.\u201d Her tone was quietly insulting, and I bit\r\nmy lip at having been caught. It was no time to make a defense.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have missed one calculation,\u201d I said coldly, \u201cand that is, the\r\ndiscovery of the man who left the train.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have found him?\u201d She bent forward, and again I regretted my hasty\r\nspeech. \u201cI knew it; I said so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are going to find him,\u201d I asserted, with a confidence I did not\r\nfeel. \u201cWe can produce at any time proof that a man left the Flier a few\r\nmiles beyond the wreck. And we can find him, I am positive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you have not found him yet?\u201d She was clearly disappointed. \u201cWell,\r\nso be it. Now for our bargain. You will admit that I am no fool.\u201d\r\n\r\nI made no such admission, and she smiled mockingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow flattering you are!\u201d she said. \u201cVery well. Now for the premises.\r\nYou take to Pittsburg four notes held by the Mechanics' National Bank,\r\nto have Mr. Gilmore, who is ill, declare his indorsement of them forged.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the journey back to Pittsburg two things happen to you: you lose\r\nyour clothing, your valise and your papers, including the notes, and\r\nyou are accused of murder. In fact, Mr. Blakeley, the circumstances were\r\nmost singular, and the evidence--well, almost conclusive.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was completely at her mercy, but I gnawed my lip with irritation.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow for the bargain.\u201d She leaned over and lowered her voice. \u201cA fair\r\nexchange, you know. The minute you put those four notes in my hand--that\r\nminute the blow to my head has caused complete forgetfulness as to\r\nthe events of that awful morning. I am the only witness, and I will be\r\nsilent. Do you understand? They will call off their dogs.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy head was buzzing with the strangeness of the idea.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut,\u201d I said, striving to gain time, \u201cI haven't the notes. I can't give\r\nyou what I haven't got.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have had the case continued,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cYou expect to find\r\nthem. Another thing,\u201d she added slowly, watching my face, \u201cif you don't\r\nget them soon, Bronson will have them. They have been offered to him\r\nalready, but at a prohibitive price.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut,\u201d I said, bewildered, \u201cwhat is your object in coming to me? If\r\nBronson will get them anyhow--\u201d\r\n\r\nShe shut her fan with a click and her face was not particularly pleasant\r\nto look at.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are dense,\u201d she said insolently. \u201cI want those papers--for myself,\r\nnot for Andy Bronson.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen the idea is,\u201d I said, ignoring her tone, \u201cthat you think you have\r\nme in a hole, and that if I find those papers and give them to you you\r\nwill let me out. As I understand it, our friend Bronson, under those\r\ncircumstances, will also be in a hole.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe notes would be of no use to you for a limited length of time,\u201d\r\n I went on, watching her narrowly. \u201cIf they are not turned over to the\r\nstate's attorney within a reasonable time there will have to be a nolle\r\npros--that is, the case will simply be dropped for lack of evidence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA week would answer, I think,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cYou will do it, then?\u201d\r\n\r\nI laughed, although I was not especially cheerful.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I'll not do it. I expect to come across the notes any time now,\r\nand I expect just as certainly to turn them over to the state's attorney\r\nwhen I get them.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe got up suddenly, pushing her chair back with a noisy grating sound\r\nthat turned many eyes toward us.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou're more of a fool than I thought you,\u201d she sneered, and left me at\r\nthe table.\r\n\nI confess I was staggered. The people at the surrounding tables, after\r\nglancing curiously in my direction, looked away again.\r\n\r\nI got my hat and went out in a very uncomfortable frame of mind. That\r\nshe would inform the police at once of what she knew I never doubted,\r\nunless possibly she would give a day or two's grace in the hope that I\r\nwould change my mind.\r\n\r\nI reviewed the situation as I waited for a car. Two passed me going in\r\nthe opposite direction, and on the first one I saw Bronson, his hat over\r\nhis eyes, his arms folded, looking moodily ahead. Was it imagination? or\r\nwas the small man huddled in the corner of the rear seat Hotchkiss?\r\n\r\nAs the car rolled on I found myself smiling. The alert little man was\r\nfor all the world like a terrier, ever on the scent, and scouring about\r\nin every direction.\r\n\r\nI found McKnight at the Incubator, with his coat off, working with\r\nenthusiasm and a manicure file over the horn of his auto.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's the worst horn I ever ran across,\u201d he groaned, without looking up,\r\nas I came in. \u201cThe blankety-blank thing won't blow.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe punched it savagely, finally eliciting a faint throaty croak.\r\n\r\n\u201cSounds like croup,\u201d I suggested. \u201cMy sister-in-law uses camphor and\r\ngoose greese for it; or how about a spice poultice?\u201d\r\n\r\nBut McKnight never sees any jokes but his own. He flung the horn\r\nclattering into a corner, and collapsed sulkily into a chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d I said, \u201cif you're through manicuring that horn, I'll tell you\r\nabout my talk with the lady in black.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat's wrong?\u201d asked McKnight languidly. \u201cPolice watching her, too?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot exactly. The fact is, Rich, there's the mischief to pay.\u201d\r\n\r\nStogie came in, bringing a few additions to our comfort. When he went\r\nout I told my story.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must remember,\u201d I said, \u201cthat I had seen this woman before the\r\nmorning of the wreck. She was buying her Pullman ticket when I did. Then\r\nthe next morning, when the murder was discovered, she grew hysterical,\r\nand I gave her some whisky. The third and last time I saw her, until\r\nto-night, was when she crouched beside the road, after the wreck.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcKnight slid down in his chair until his weight rested on the small of\r\nhis back, and put his feet on the big reading table.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is rather a facer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's really too good a situation for\r\na commonplace lawyer. It ought to be dramatized. You can't agree, of\r\ncourse; and by refusing you run the chance of jail, at least, and of\r\nhaving Alison brought into publicity, which is out of the question. You\r\nsay she was at the Pullman window when you were?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; I bought her ticket for her. Gave her lower eleven.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you took ten?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLower ten.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcKnight straightened up and looked at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen she thought you were in lower ten.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose she did, if she thought at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut listen, man.\u201d McKnight was growing excited. \u201cWhat do you figure out\r\nof this? The Conway woman knows you have taken the notes to Pittsburg.\r\nThe probabilities are that she follows you there, on the chance of an\r\nopportunity to get them, either for Bronson or herself.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing doing during the trip over or during the day in Pittsburg; but\r\nshe learns the number of your berth as you buy it at the Pullman ticket\r\noffice in Pittsburg, and she thinks she sees her chance. No one could\r\nhave foreseen that that drunken fellow would have crawled into your\r\nberth.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, I figure it out this way: She wanted those notes desperately--does\r\nstill--not for Bronson, but to hold over his head for some purpose. In\r\nthe night, when everything is quiet, she slips behind the curtains of\r\nlower ten, where the man's breathing shows he is asleep. Didn't you say\r\nhe snored?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe did!\u201d I affirmed. \u201cBut I tell you--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow keep still and listen. She gropes cautiously around in the\r\ndarkness, finally discovering the wallet under the pillow. Can't you see\r\nit yourself?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was leaning forward, excitedly, and I could almost see the gruesome\r\ntragedy he was depicting.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe draws out the wallet. Then, perhaps she remembers the alligator\r\nbag, and on the possibility that the notes are there, instead of in\r\nthe pocket-book, she gropes around for it. Suddenly, the man awakes and\r\nclutches at the nearest object, perhaps her neck chain, which breaks.\r\nShe drops the pocket-book and tries to escape, but he has caught her\r\nright hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is all in silence; the man is still stupidly drunk. But he holds her\r\nin a tight grip. Then the tragedy. She must get away; in a minute\r\nthe car will be aroused. Such a woman, on such an errand, does not go\r\nwithout some sort of a weapon, in this case a dagger, which, unlike a\r\nrevolver, is noiseless.\r\n\r\n\u201cWith a quick thrust--she's a big woman and a bold one--she strikes.\r\nPossibly Hotchkiss is right about the left-hand blow. Harrington may\r\nhave held her right hand, or perhaps she held the dirk in her left hand\r\nas she groped with her right. Then, as the man falls back, and his grasp\r\nrelaxes, she straightens and attempts to get away. The swaying of the\r\ncar throws her almost into your berth, and, trembling with terror, she\r\ncrouches behind the curtains of lower ten until everything is still.\r\nThen she goes noiselessly back to her berth.\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to fit partly, at least,\u201d I said. \u201cIn the morning when she\r\nfound that the crime had been not only fruitless, but that she had\r\nsearched the wrong berth and killed the wrong man; when she saw me\r\nemerge, unhurt, just as she was bracing herself for the discovery of my\r\ndead body, then she went into hysterics. You remember, I gave her some\r\nwhisky.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt really seems a tenable theory. But, like the Sullivan theory, there\r\nare one or two things that don't agree with the rest. For one thing, how\r\ndid the remainder of that chain get into Alison West's possession?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe may have picked it up on the floor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe'll admit that,\u201d I said; \u201cand I'm sure I hope so. Then how did the\r\nmurdered man's pocket-book get into the sealskin bag? And the dirk, how\r\naccount for that, and the blood-stains?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow what's the use,\u201d asked McKnight aggrievedly, \u201cof my building up\r\nbeautiful theories for you to pull down? We'll take it to Hotchkiss.\r\nMaybe he can tell from the blood-stains if the murderer's finger nails\r\nwere square or pointed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHotchkiss is no fool,\u201d I said warmly. \u201cUnder all his theories there's\r\na good hard layer of common sense. And we must remember, Rich, that\r\nneither of our theories includes the woman at Doctor Van Kirk's\r\nhospital, that the charming picture you have just drawn does not account\r\nfor Alison West's connection with the case, or for the bits of telegram\r\nin the Sullivan fellow's pajamas pocket. You are like the man who put\r\nthe clock together; you've got half of the works left over.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, go home,\u201d said McKnight disgustedly. \u201cI'm no Edgar Allan Poe.\r\nWhat's the use of coming here and asking me things if you're so\r\nparticular?\u201d\r\n\r\nWith one of his quick changes of mood, he picked up his guitar.\r\n\r\n\u201cListen to this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a Hawaiian song about a fat lady, oh,\r\nignorant one! and how she fell off her mule.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut for all the lightness of the words, the voice that followed me down\r\nthe stairs was anything but cheery.\r\n\r\n     \u201cThere was a Kanaka in Balu did dwell,\r\n     Who had for his daughter a monstrous fat girl--\r\n\r\nhe sang in his clear tenor. I paused on the lower floor and listened. He\r\nhad stopped singing as abruptly as he had begun.\r\n\nI had not been home for thirty-six hours, since the morning of the\r\npreceding day. Johnson was not in sight, and I let myself in quietly\r\nwith my latchkey. It was almost midnight, and I had hardly settled\r\nmyself in the library when the bell rang and I was surprised to find\r\nHotchkiss, much out of breath, in the vestibule.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, come in, Mr. Hotchkiss,\u201d I said. \u201cI thought you were going home to\r\ngo to bed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I was, so I was.\u201d He dropped into a chair beside my reading lamp and\r\nmopped his face. \u201cAnd here it is almost midnight, and I'm wider awake\r\nthan ever. I've seen Sullivan, Mr. Blakeley.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have,\u201d he said impressively.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were following Bronson at eight o'clock. Was that when it\r\nhappened?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSomething of the sort. When I left you at the door of the restaurant, I\r\nturned and almost ran into a plain clothes man from the central office.\r\nI know him pretty well; once or twice he has taken me with him on\r\ninteresting bits of work. He knows my hobby.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know him, too, probably. It was the man Arnold, the detective whom\r\nthe state's attorney has had watching Bronson.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohnson being otherwise occupied, I had asked for Arnold myself.\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, he stopped me at once; said he'd been on the fellow's tracks\r\nsince early morning and had had no time for luncheon. Bronson, it seems,\r\nisn't eating much these days. I at once jotted down the fact, because it\r\nargued that he was being bothered by the man with the notes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt might point to other things,\u201d I suggested. \u201cIndigestion, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\nHotchkiss ignored me. \u201cWell, Arnold had some reason for thinking that\r\nBronson would try to give him the slip that night, so he asked me to\r\nstay around the private entrance there while he ran across the Street\r\nand got something to eat. It seemed a fair presumption that, as he had\r\ngone there with a lady, they would dine leisurely, and Arnold would have\r\nplenty of time to get back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about your own dinner?\u201d I asked curiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cSir,\u201d he said pompously, \u201cI have given you a wrong estimate of Wilson\r\nBudd Hotchkiss if you think that a question of dinner would even obtrude\r\nitself on his mind at such a time as this.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was a frail little man, and to-night he looked pale with heat and\r\nover-exertion.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you have any luncheon?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\nHe was somewhat embarrassed at that.\r\n\r\n\u201cI--really, Mr. Blakeley, the events of the day were so engrossing--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI'm not going to see you drop on the floor from\r\nexhaustion. Just wait a minute.\u201d\r\n\r\nI went back to the pantry, only to be confronted with rows of locked\r\ndoors and empty dishes. Downstairs, in the basement kitchen, however, I\r\nfound two unattractive looking cold chops, some dry bread and a piece\r\nof cake, wrapped in a napkin, and from its surreptitious and generally\r\nhang-dog appearance, destined for the coachman in the stable at the\r\nrear. Trays there were none--everything but the chairs and tables seemed\r\nunder lock and key, and there was neither napkin, knife nor fork to be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe luncheon was not attractive in appearance, but Hotchkiss ate his\r\ncold chops and gnawed at the crusts as though he had been famished,\r\nwhile he told his story.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had been there only a few minutes,\u201d he said, with a chop in one hand\r\nand the cake in the other, \u201cwhen Bronson rushed out and cut across the\r\nstreet. He's a tall man, Mr. Blakeley, and I had had work keeping close.\r\nIt was a relief when he jumped on a passing car, although being well\r\nbehind, it was a hard run for me to catch him. He had left the lady.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnce on the car, we simply rode from one end of the line to the other\r\nand back again. I suppose he was passing the time, for he looked at his\r\nwatch now and then, and when I did once get a look at us face it made\r\nme--er--uncomfortable. He could have crushed me like a fly, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had brought Mr. Hotchkiss a glass of wine, and he was looking better.\r\nHe stopped to finish it, declining with a wave of his hand to have it\r\nrefilled, and continued:\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout nine o'clock or a little later he got off somewhere near\r\nWashington Circle. He went along one of the residence streets there,\r\nturned to his left a square or two, and rang a bell. He had been\r\nadmitted when I got there, but I guessed from the appearance of the\r\nplace that it was a boarding-house.\r\n\r\n\u201cI waited a few minutes and rang the bell. When a maid answered it, I\r\nasked for Mr. Sullivan. Of course there was no Mr. Sullivan there.\r\n\r\n\u201cI said I was sorry; that the man I was looking for was a new boarder.\r\nShe was sure there was no such boarder in the house; the only new\r\narrival was a man on the third floor--she thought his name was Stuart.\r\n\r\n\u201c'My friend has a cousin by that name,' I said. 'I'll just go up and\r\nsee.'\r\n\r\n\u201cShe wanted to show me up, but I said it was unnecessary. So after\r\ntelling me it was the bedroom and sitting-room on the third floor front,\r\nI went up.\r\n\r\n\u201cI met a couple of men on the stairs, but neither of them paid any\r\nattention to me. A boarding-house is the easiest place in the world to\r\nenter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey're not always so easy to leave,\u201d I put in, to his evident\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I got to the third story, I took out a bunch of keys and posted\r\nmyself by a door near the ones the girl had indicated. I could hear\r\nvoices in one of the front rooms, but could not understand what they\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was no violent dispute, but a steady hum. Then Bronson jerked the\r\ndoor open. If he had stepped into the hall he would have seen me fitting\r\na key into the door before me. But he spoke before he came out.\r\n\r\n\u201c'You're acting like a maniac,' he said. 'You know I can get those\r\nthings some way; I'm not going to threaten you. It isn't necessary. You\r\nknow me.'\r\n\r\n\u201c'It would be no use,' the other man said. 'I tell you, I haven't seen\r\nthe notes for ten days.'\r\n\r\n\u201c'But you will,' Bronson said savagely. 'You're standing in your own\r\nway, that's all. If you're holding out expecting me to raise my figure,\r\nyou're making a mistake. It's my last offer.'\r\n\r\n\u201c'I couldn't take it if it was for a million,' said the man inside the\r\nroom. 'I'd do it, I expect, if I could. The best of us have our price.'\r\n\r\n\u201cBronson slammed the door then, and flung past me down the hall.\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter a couple of minutes I knocked at the door, and a tall man about\r\nyour size, Mr. Blakeley, opened it. He was very blond, with a smooth\r\nface and blue eyes--what I think you would call a handsome man.\r\n\r\n\u201c'I beg your pardon for disturbing you,' I said. 'Can you tell me which\r\nis Mr. Johnson's room? Mr. Francis Johnson?'\r\n\r\n\u201c'I can not say,' he replied civilly. 'I've only been here a few days.'\r\n\r\n\u201cI thanked him and left, but I had had a good look at him, and I think\r\nI'd know him readily any place.\u201d\r\n\r\nI sat for a few minutes thinking it over. \u201cBut what did he mean by\r\nsaying he hadn't seen the notes for ten days? And why is Bronson making\r\nthe overtures?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think he was lying,\u201d Hotchkiss reflected. \u201cBronson hasn't reached his\r\nfigure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's a big advance, Mr. Hotchkiss, and I appreciate what you have done\r\nmore than I can tell you,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd now, if you can locate any of\r\nmy property in this fellow's room, we'll send him up for larceny, and at\r\nleast have him where we can get at him. I'm going to Cresson to-morrow,\r\nto try to trace him a little from there. But I'll be back in a couple of\r\ndays, and we'll begin to gather in these scattered threads.\u201d\r\n\r\nHotchkiss rubbed his hands together delightedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat's it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's what we want to do, Mr. Blakeley. We'll\r\ngather up the threads ourselves; if we let the police in too soon,\r\nthey'll tangle it up again. I'm not vindictive by nature; but when a\r\nfellow like Sullivan not only commits a murder, but goes to all sorts\r\nof trouble to put the burden of guilt on an innocent man--I say hunt him\r\ndown, sir!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are convinced, of course, that Sullivan did it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho else?\u201d He looked over his glasses at me with the air of a man whose\r\nmental attitude is unassailable. \u201cWell, listen to this,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\nThen I told him at length of my encounter with Bronson in the\r\nrestaurant, of the bargain proposed by Mrs. Conway, and finally of\r\nMcKnight's new theory. But, although he was impressed, he was far from\r\nconvinced.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's a very vivid piece of imagination,\u201d he said drily; \u201cbut while it\r\nfits the evidence as far as it goes, it doesn't go far enough. How about\r\nthe stains in lower seven, the dirk, and the wallet? Haven't we even got\r\nmotive in that telegram from Bronson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I admitted, \u201cbut that bit of chain--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPooh,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cPerhaps, like yourself, Sullivan wore glasses\r\nwith a chain. Our not finding them does not prove they did not exist.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd there I made an error; half confidences are always mistakes. I could\r\nnot tell of the broken chain in Alison West's gold purse.\r\n\r\nIt was one o'clock when Hotchkiss finally left. We had by that time\r\narranged a definite course of action--Hotchkiss to search Sullivan's\r\nrooms and if possible find evidence to have him held for larceny, while\r\nI went to Cresson.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, however, when I entered the train the following\r\nmorning, Hotchkiss was already there. He had bought a new note-book, and\r\nwas sharpening a fresh pencil.\r\n\r\n\u201cI changed my plans, you see,\u201d he said, bustling his newspaper aside for\r\nme. \u201cIt is no discredit to your intelligence, Mr. Blakeley, but you lack\r\nthe professional eye, the analytical mind. You legal gentlemen call a\r\nspade a spade, although it may be a shovel.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \u201c'A primrose by the river's brim\r\n     A yellow primrose was to him,\r\n     And nothing more!'\u201d\r\n\r\nI quoted as the train pulled out.\r\n\nI slept most of the way to Cresson, to the disgust of the little\r\ndetective. Finally he struck up an acquaintance with a kindly-faced old\r\npriest on his way home to his convent school, armed with a roll of dance\r\nmusic and surreptitious bundles that looked like boxes of candy.\r\nFrom scraps of conversation I gleaned that there had been mysterious\r\noccurrences at the convent,--ending in the theft of what the reverend\r\nfather called vaguely, \u201ca quantity of undermuslins.\u201d I dropped asleep at\r\nthat point, and when I roused a few moments later, the conversation had\r\nprogressed. Hotchkiss had a diagram on an envelope.\r\n\r\n\u201cWith this window bolted, and that one inaccessible, and if, as you say,\r\nthe--er--garments were in a tub here at X, then, as you hold the key\r\nto the other door,--I think you said the convent dog did not raise any\r\ndisturbance? Pardon a personal question, but do you ever walk in your\r\nsleep?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe priest looked bewildered.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'll tell you what to do,\u201d Hotchkiss said cheerfully, leaning\r\nforward, \u201clook around a little yourself before you call in the police.\r\nSomnambulism is a queer thing. It's a question whether we are most\r\nourselves sleeping or waking. Ever think of that? Live a saintly life\r\nall day, prayers and matins and all that, and the subconscious mind\r\nhikes you out of bed at night to steal undermuslins! Subliminal theft,\r\nso to speak. Better examine the roof.\u201d\r\n\r\nI dozed again. When I wakened Hotchkiss sat alone, and the priest, from\r\na corner, was staring at him dazedly, over his breviary.\r\n\r\nIt was raining when we reached Cresson, a wind-driven rain that had\r\nforced the agent at the newsstand to close himself in, and that beat\r\nback from the rails in parallel lines of white spray. As he went up the\r\nmain street, Hotchkiss was cheerfully oblivious of the weather, of\r\nthe threatening dusk, of our generally draggled condition. My draggled\r\ncondition, I should say, for he improved every moment,--his eyes\r\nbrighter, his ruddy face ruddier, his collar newer and glossier.\r\nSometime, when it does not encircle the little man's neck, I shall test\r\nthat collar with a match.\r\n\r\nI was growing steadily more depressed: I loathed my errand and its\r\nnecessity. I had always held that a man who played the spy on a woman\r\nwas beneath contempt. Then, I admit I was afraid of what I might learn.\r\nFor a time, however, this promised to be a negligible quantity. The\r\nstreets of the straggling little mountain town had been clean-washed of\r\nhumanity by the downpour. Windows and doors were inhospitably shut, and\r\nfrom around an occasional drawn shade came narrow strips of light that\r\nmerely emphasized our gloom. When Hotchkiss' umbrella turned inside out,\r\nI stopped.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't know where you are going,\u201d I snarled, \u201cI don't care. But I'm\r\ngoing to get under cover inside of ten seconds. I'm not amphibious.\u201d\r\n\r\nI ducked into the next shelter, which happened to be the yawning\r\nentrance to a livery stable, and shook myself, dog fashion. Hotchkiss\r\nwiped his collar with his handkerchief. It emerged gleaming and\r\nunwilted.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis will do as well as any place,\u201d he said, raising his voice above\r\nthe rattle of the rain. \u201cGot to make a beginning.\u201d\r\n\r\nI sat down on the usual chair without a back, just inside the door,\r\nand stared out at the darkening street. The whole affair had an air of\r\nunreality. Now that I was there, I doubted the necessity, or the value,\r\nof the journey. I was wet and uncomfortable. Around me, with Cresson\r\nas a center, stretched an irregular circumference of mountain, with\r\npossibly a ten-mile radius, and in it I was to find the residence of a\r\nwoman whose first name I did not know, and a man who, so far, had been a\r\npurely chimerical person.\r\n\r\nHotchkiss had penetrated the steaming interior of the cave, and now his\r\nvoice, punctuated by the occasional thud of horses' hoofs, came to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cSomething light will do,\u201d he was saying. \u201cA runabout, perhaps.\u201d He came\r\nforward rubbing his hands, followed by a thin man in overalls. \u201cMr. Peck\r\nsays,\u201d he began,--\u201cthis is Mr. Peck of Peck and Peck,--says that the\r\nplace we are looking for is about seven miles from the town. It's\r\nclearing, isn't it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not,\u201d I returned savagely. \u201cAnd we don't want a runabout, Mr.\r\nPeck. What we require is hermetically sealed diving suit. I suppose\r\nthere isn't a machine to be had?\u201d Mr. Peck gazed at me, in silence:\r\nmachine to him meant other things than motors. \u201cAutomobile,\u201d I\r\nsupplemented. His face cleared.\r\n\r\n\u201cNone but private affairs. I can give you a good buggy with a rubber\r\napron. Mike, is the doctor's horse in?\u201d\r\n\r\nI am still uncertain as to whether the raw-boned roan we took out that\r\nnight over the mountains was the doctor's horse or not. If it was, the\r\ndoctor may be a good doctor, but he doesn't know anything about a horse.\r\nAnd furthermore, I hope he didn't need the beast that miserable evening.\r\n\r\nWhile they harnessed the horse, Hotchkiss told me what he had learned.\r\n\r\n\u201cSix Curtises in the town and vicinity,\u201d he said. \u201cSort of family name\r\naround here. One of them is telegraph operator at the station. Person we\r\nare looking for is--was--a wealthy widow with a brother named Sullivan!\r\nBoth supposed to have been killed on the Flier.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHer brother,\u201d I repeated stupidly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d Hotchkiss went on, \u201cthree people, in one party, took the\r\ntrain here that night, Miss West, Mrs. Curtis and Sullivan. The two\r\nwomen had the drawing-room, Sullivan had lower seven. What we want to\r\nfind out is just who these people were, where they came from, if Bronson\r\nknew them, and how Miss West became entangled with them. She may have\r\nmarried Sullivan, for one thing.\u201d\r\n\r\nI fell into gloom after that. The roan was led unwillingly into the\r\nweather, Hotchkiss and I in eclipse behind the blanket. The liveryman\r\nstood in the doorway and called directions to us. \u201cYou can't miss it,\u201d\r\n he finished. \u201cGot the name over the gate anyhow, 'The Laurels.' The\r\nservants are still there: leastways, we didn't bring them down.\u201d He even\r\ntook a step into the rain as Hotchkiss picked up the lines. \u201cIf you're\r\ngoing to settle the estate,\u201d he bawled, \u201cdon't forget us, Peck and Peck.\r\nA half-bushel of name and a bushel of service.\u201d\r\n\r\nHotchkiss could not drive. Born a clerk, he guided the roan much as\r\nhe would drive a bad pen. And the roan spattered through puddles and\r\nsplashed ink--mud, that is--until I was in a frenzy of irritation.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to say when we get there?\u201d I asked after I had\r\nfinally taken the reins in my one useful hand. \u201cGet out there at\r\nmidnight and tell the servants we have come to ask a few questions about\r\nthe family? It's an idiotic trip anyhow; I wish I had stayed at home.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe roan fell just then, and we had to crawl out and help him up. By the\r\ntime we had partly unharnessed him our matches were gone, and the small\r\nbicycle lamp on the buggy was wavering only too certainly. We were\r\ncovered with mud, panting with exertion, and even Hotchkiss showed a\r\ndisposition to be surly. The rain, which had lessened for a time, came\r\non again, the lightning flashes doing more than anything else to reveal\r\nour isolated position.\r\n\r\nAnother mile saw us, if possible, more despondent. The water in our\r\nclothes had had time to penetrate: the roan had sprained his shoulder,\r\nand drew us along in a series of convulsive jerks. And then through\r\nthe rain-spattered window of the blanket, I saw a light. It was a small\r\nlight, rather yellow, and it lasted perhaps thirty seconds. Hotchkiss\r\nmissed it, and was inclined to doubt me. But in a couple of minutes the\r\nroan hobbled to the side of the road and stopped, and I made out a break\r\nin the pines and an arched gate.\r\n\r\nIt was a small gate, too narrow for the buggy. I pulled the horse into\r\nas much shelter as possible under the trees, and we got out. Hotchkiss\r\ntied the beast and we left him there, head down against the driving\r\nrain, drooping and dejected. Then we went toward the house.\r\n\r\nIt was a long walk. The path bent and twisted, and now and then we\r\nlost it. We were climbing as we went. Oddly there were no lights ahead,\r\nalthough it was only ten o'clock,--not later. Hotchkiss kept a little\r\nahead of me, knocking into trees now and then, but finding the path in\r\nhalf the time I should have taken. Once, as I felt my way around a tree\r\nin the blackness, I put my hand unexpectedly on his shoulder, and felt a\r\nshudder go down my back.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you expect me to do?\u201d he protested, when I remonstrated. \u201cHang\r\nout a red lantern? What was that? Listen.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe both stood peering into the gloom. The sharp patter of the rain\r\non leaves had ceased, and from just ahead there came back to us the\r\nstealthy padding of feet in wet soil. My hand closed on Hotchkiss'\r\nshoulder, and we listened together, warily. The steps were close by,\r\nunmistakable. The next flash of lightning showed nothing moving: the\r\nhouse was in full view now, dark and uninviting, looming huge above a\r\nterrace, with an Italian garden at the side. Then the blackness again.\r\nSomebody's teeth were chattering: I accused Hotchkiss but he denied it.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlthough I'm not very comfortable, I'll admit,\u201d he confessed; \u201cthere\r\nwas something breathing right at my elbow here a moment ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNonsense!\u201d I took his elbow and steered him in what I made out to be\r\nthe direction of the steps of the Italian garden. \u201cI saw a deer just\r\nahead by the last flash; that's what you heard. By Jove, I hear wheels.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe paused to listen and Hotchkiss put his hand on something close to us.\r\n\u201cHere's your deer,\u201d he said. \u201cBronze.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs we neared the house the sense of surveillance we had had in the\r\npark gradually left us. Stumbling over flower beds, running afoul of\r\na sun-dial, groping our way savagely along hedges and thorny banks, we\r\nreached the steps finally and climbed the terrace.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Hotchkiss fell over one of the two stone urns which,\r\nwith tall boxwood trees in them, mounted guard at each side of the door.\r\nHe didn't make any attempt to get up. He sat in a puddle on the brick\r\nfloor of the terrace and clutched his leg and swore softly in Government\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nThe occasional relief of the lightning was gone. I could not see an\r\noutline of the house before me. We had no matches, and an instant's\r\ninvestigation showed that the windows were boarded and the house closed.\r\nHotchkiss, still recumbent, was ascertaining the damage, tenderly\r\npeeling down his stocking.\r\n\r\n\u201cUpon my soul,\u201d he said finally, \u201cI don't know whether this moisture is\r\nblood or rain. I think I've broken a bone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBlood is thicker than water,\u201d I suggested. \u201cIs it sticky? See if you\r\ncan move your toes.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause: Hotchkiss moved his toes. By that time I had found a\r\nknocker and was making the night hideous. But there was no response save\r\nthe wind that blew sodden leaves derisively in our faces. Once Hotchkiss\r\ndeclared he heard a window-sash lifted, but renewed violence with the\r\nknocker produced no effect.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere's only one thing to do,\u201d I said finally. \u201cI'll go back and try to\r\nbring the buggy up for you. You can't walk, can you?\u201d\r\n\r\nHotchkiss sat back in his puddle and said he didn't think he could stir,\r\nbut for me to go back to town and leave him, that he didn't have any\r\nfamily dependent on him, and that if he was going to have pneumonia he\r\nhad probably got it already. I left him there, and started back to get\r\nthe horse.\r\n\r\nIf possible, it was worse than before. There was no lightning, and only\r\nby a miracle did I find the little gate again. I drew a long breath of\r\nrelief, followed by another, equally long, of dismay. For I had found\r\nthe hitching strap and there was nothing at the end of it! In a lull of\r\nthe wind I seemed to hear, far off, the eager thud of stable-bound feet.\r\nSo for the second time I climbed the slope to the Laurels, and on the\r\nway I thought of many things to say.\r\n\r\nI struck the house at a new angle, for I found a veranda, destitute of\r\nchairs and furnishings, but dry and evidently roofed. It was better than\r\nthe terrace, and so, by groping along the wall, I tried to make my way\r\nto Hotchkiss. That was how I found the open window. I had passed perhaps\r\nsix, all closed, and to have my hand grope for the next one, and to find\r\ninstead the soft drapery of an inner curtain, was startling, to say the\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nI found Hotchkiss at last around an angle of the stone wall, and told\r\nhim that the horse was gone. He was disconcerted, but not abased;\r\nmaintaining that it was a new kind of knot that couldn't slip and that\r\nthe horse must have chewed the halter through! He was less enthusiastic\r\nthan I had expected about the window.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt looks uncommonly like a trap,\u201d he said. \u201cI tell you there was some\r\none in the park below when we were coming up. Man has a sixth sense that\r\nscientists ignore--a sense of the nearness of things. And all the time\r\nyou have been gone, some one has been watching me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCouldn't see you,\u201d I maintained; \u201cI can't see you now. And your sense\r\nof contiguity didn't tell you about that flower crock.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the end, of course, he consented to go with me. He was very lame, and\r\nI helped him around to the open window. He was full of moral courage,\r\nthe little man: it was only the physical in him that quailed. And as we\r\ngroped along, he insisted on going through the window first.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf it is a trap,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI have two arms to your one, and,\r\nbesides, as I said before, life holds much for you. As for me, the\r\ngovernment would merely lose an indifferent employee.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen he found I was going first he was rather hurt, but I did not wait\r\nfor his protests. I swung my feet over the sill and dropped. I made a\r\nclutch at the window-frame with my good hand when I found no floor under\r\nmy feet, but I was too late. I dropped probably ten feet and landed with\r\na crash that seemed to split my ear-drums. I was thoroughly shaken, but\r\nin some miraculous way the bandaged arm had escaped injury.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor Heaven's sake,\u201d Hotchkiss was calling from above, \u201chave you broken\r\nyour back?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I returned, as steadily as I could, \u201cmerely driven it up through\r\nmy skull. This is a staircase. I'm coming up to open another window.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was eerie work, but I accomplished it finally, discovering, not\r\nwithout mishap, a room filled with more tables than I had ever dreamed\r\nof, tables that seemed to waylay and strike at me. When I had got\r\na window open, Hotchkiss crawled through, and we were at last under\r\nshelter.\r\n\r\nOur first thought was for a light. The same laborious investigation\r\nthat had landed us where we were, revealed that the house was lighted\r\nby electricity, and that the plant was not in operation. By accident\r\nI stumbled across a tabouret with smoking materials, and found a half\r\ndozen matches. The first one showed us the magnitude of the room we\r\nstood in, and revealed also a brass candle-stick by the open fireplace,\r\na candle-stick almost four feet high, supporting a candle of similar\r\ncolossal proportions. It was Hotchkiss who discovered that it had been\r\nrecently lighted. He held the match to it and peered at it over his\r\nglasses.\r\n\r\n\u201cWithin ten minutes,\u201d he announced impressively, \u201cthis candle has been\r\nburning. Look at the wax! And the wick! Both soft.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps it's the damp weather,\u201d I ventured, moving a little nearer to\r\nthe circle of light. A gust of wind came in just then, and the flame\r\nturned over on its side and threatened demise. There was something\r\nalmost ridiculous in the haste with which we put down the window and\r\nnursed the flicker to life.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarly ghost-like appearance of the room added to the\r\nuncanniness of the situation. The furniture was swathed in white covers\r\nfor the winter; even the pictures wore shrouds. And in a niche between\r\ntwo windows a bust on a pedestal, similarly wrapped, one arm extended\r\nunder its winding sheet, made a most life-like ghost, if any ghost can\r\nbe life-like.\r\n\r\nIn the light of the candle we surveyed each other, and we were objects\r\nfor mirth. Hotchkiss was taking off his sodden shoes and preparing to\r\nmake himself comfortable, while I hung my muddy raincoat over the ghost\r\nin the corner. Thus habited, he presented a rakish but distinctly more\r\ncomfortable appearance.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen these people built,\u201d Hotchkiss said, surveying the huge dimensions\r\nof the room, \u201cthey must have bought a mountain and built all over it.\r\nWhat a room!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt seemed to be a living-room, although Hotchkiss remarked that it\r\nwas much more like a dead one. It was probably fifty feet long and\r\ntwenty-five feet wide. It was very high, too, with a domed ceiling,\r\nand a gallery ran around the entire room, about fifteen feet above the\r\nfloor. The candle light did not penetrate beyond the dim outlines of the\r\ngallery rail, but I fancied the wall there hung with smaller pictures.\r\n\r\nHotchkiss had discovered a fire laid in the enormous fireplace, and in a\r\nfew minutes we were steaming before a cheerful blaze. Within the radius\r\nof its light and heat, we were comfortable again. But the brightness\r\nmerely emphasized the gloom of the ghostly corners. We talked in subdued\r\ntones, and I smoked, a box of Russian cigarettes which I found in a\r\ntable drawer. We had decided to stay all night, there being nothing else\r\nto do. I suggested a game of double-dummy bridge, but did not urge it\r\nwhen my companion asked me if it resembled euchre. Gradually, as the\r\necclesiastical candle paled in the firelight, we grew drowsy. I drew\r\na divan into the cheerful area, and stretched myself out for sleep.\r\nHotchkiss, who said the pain in his leg made him wakeful, sat wide-eyed\r\nby the fire, smoking a pipe.\r\n\r\nI have no idea how much time had passed when something threw itself\r\nviolently on my chest. I roused with a start and leaped to my feet, and\r\na large Angora cat fell with a thump to the floor. The fire was still\r\nbright, and there was an odor of scorched leather through the room, from\r\nHotchkiss' shoes. The little detective was sound asleep, his dead pipe\r\nin his fingers. The cat sat back on its haunches and wailed.\r\n\r\nThe curtain at the door into the hallway bellied slowly out into the\r\nroom and fell again. The cat looked toward it and opened its mouth\r\nfor another howl. I thrust at it with my foot, but it refused to move.\r\nHotchkiss stirred uneasily, and his pipe clattered to the floor.\r\n\r\nThe cat was standing at my feet, staring behind me. Apparently it was\r\nfollowing with its eyes, an object unseen to me, that moved behind\r\nme. The tip of its tail waved threateningly, but when I wheeled I saw\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nI took the candle and made a circuit of the room. Behind the curtain\r\nthat had moved the door was securely closed. The windows were shut and\r\nlocked, and everywhere the silence was absolute. The cat followed me\r\nmajestically. I stooped and stroked its head, but it persisted in its\r\nuncanny watching of the corners of the room.\r\n\r\nWhen I went back to my divan, after putting a fresh log on the fire, I\r\nwas reassured. I took the precaution, and smiled at myself for doing it,\r\nto put the fire tongs within reach of my hand. But the cat would not let\r\nme sleep. After a time I decided that it wanted water, and I started\r\nout in search of some, carrying the candle without the stand. I wandered\r\nthrough several rooms, all closed and dismantled, before I found a small\r\nlavatory opening off a billiard room. The cat lapped steadily, and I\r\nfilled a glass to take back with me. The candle flickered in a sickly\r\nfashion that threatened to leave me there lost in the wanderings of the\r\nmany hallways, and from somewhere there came an occasional violent puff\r\nof wind. The cat stuck by my feet, with the hair on its back raised\r\nmenacingly. I don't like cats; there is something psychic about them.\r\n\r\nHotchkiss was still asleep when I got back to the big room. I moved his\r\nboots back from the fire, and trimmed the candle. Then, with sleep gone\r\nfrom me, I lay back on my divan and reflected on many things: on my\r\nidiocy in coming; on Alison West, and the fact that only a week before\r\nshe had been a guest in this very house; on Richey and the constraint\r\nthat had come between us. From that I drifted back to Alison, and to the\r\nbarrier my comparative poverty would be.\r\n\r\nThe emptiness, the stillness were oppressive. Once I heard footsteps\r\ncoming, rhythmical steps that neither hurried nor dragged, and seemed to\r\nmount endless staircases without coming any closer. I realized finally\r\nthat I had not quite turned off the tap, and that the lavatory, which I\r\nhad circled to reach, must be quite close.\r\n\r\nThe cat lay by the fire, its nose on its folded paws, content in the\r\nwarmth and companionship. I watched it idly. Now and then the green\r\nwood hissed in the fire, but the cat never batted an eye. Through an\r\nunshuttered window the lightning flashed. Suddenly the cat looked up.\r\nIt lifted its head and stared directly at the gallery above. Then it\r\nblinked, and stared again. I was amused. Not until it had got up on its\r\nfeet, eyes still riveted on the balcony, tail waving at the tip, the\r\nhair on its back a bristling brush, did I glance casually over my head.\r\n\r\nFrom among the shadows a face gazed down at me, a face that seemed a\r\nfitting tenant of the ghostly room below. I saw it as plainly as I might\r\nsee my own face in a mirror. While I stared at it with horrified eyes,\r\nthe apparition faded. The rail was there, the Bokhara rug still swung\r\nfrom it, but the gallery was empty.\r\n\r\nThe cat threw back its head and wailed.\r\n\nI jumped up and seized the fire tongs. The cat's wail had roused\r\nHotchkiss, who was wide-awake at once. He took in my offensive attitude,\r\nthe tongs, the direction of my gaze, and needed nothing more. As he\r\npicked up the candle and darted out into the hall, I followed him. He\r\nmade directly for the staircase, and part way up he turned off to the\r\nright through a small door. We were on the gallery itself; below us the\r\nfire gleamed cheerfully, the cat was not in sight. There was no sign\r\nof my ghostly visitant, but as we stood there the Bokhara rug, without\r\nwarning, slid over the railing and fell to the floor below.\r\n\r\n\u201cMan or woman?\u201d Hotchkiss inquired in his most professional tone.\r\n\r\n\u201cNeither--that is, I don't know. I didn't notice anything but the eyes,\u201d\r\n I muttered. \u201cThey were looking a hole in me. If you'd seen that cat you\r\nwould realize my state of mind. That was a traditional graveyard yowl.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't think you saw anything at all,\u201d he lied cheerfully. \u201cYou dozed\r\noff, and the rest is the natural result of a meal on a buffet car.\u201d\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he examined the Bokhara carefully when we went down,\r\nand when I finally went to sleep he was reading the only book in\r\nsight--Elwell on Bridge. The first rays of daylight were coming mistily\r\ninto the room when he roused me. He had his finger on his lips, and he\r\nwhispered sibilantly while I tried to draw on my distorted boots.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think we have him,\u201d he said triumphantly. \u201cI've been looking around\r\nsome, and I can tell you this much. Just before we came in through the\r\nwindow last night, another man came. Only--he did not drop, as you\r\ndid. He swung over to the stair railing, and then down. The rail is\r\nscratched. He was long enough ahead of us to go into the dining-room\r\nand get a decanter out of the sideboard. He poured out the liquor into\r\na glass, left the decanter there, and took the whisky into the library\r\nacross the hall. Then--he broke into a desk, using a paper knife for a\r\njimmy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood Lord, Hotchkiss,\u201d I exclaimed; \u201cwhy, it may have been Sullivan\r\nhimself! Confound your theories--he's getting farther away every\r\nminute.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was Sullivan,\u201d Hotchkiss returned imperturbably. \u201cAnd he has not\r\ngone. His boots are by the library fire.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe probably had a dozen pairs where he could get them,\u201d I scoffed. \u201cAnd\r\nwhile you and I sat and slept, the very man we want to get our hands on\r\nleered at us over that railing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSoftly, softly, my friend,\u201d Hotchkiss said, as I stamped into my other\r\nshoe. \u201cI did not say he was gone. Don't jump at conclusions. It is\r\nfatal to reasoning. As a matter of fact, he didn't relish a night on the\r\nmountains any more than we did. After he had unintentionally frightened\r\nyou almost into paralysis, what would my gentleman naturally do? Go out\r\nin the storm again? Not if I know the Alice-sit-by-the-fire type. He\r\nwent up-stairs, well up near the roof, locked himself in and went to\r\nbed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd he is there now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is there now.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had no weapons. I am aware that the traditional hero is always armed,\r\nand that Hotchkiss as the low comedian should have had a revolver that\r\nmissed fire. As a fact, we had nothing of the sort. Hotchkiss carried\r\nthe fire tongs, but my sense of humor was too strong for me; I declined\r\nthe poker.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll we want is a little peaceable conversation with him,\u201d I demurred.\r\n\u201cWe can't brain him first and converse with him afterward. And anyhow,\r\nwhile I can't put my finger on the place, I think your theory is weak.\r\nIf he wouldn't run a hundred miles through fire and water to get away\r\nfrom us, then he is not the man we want.\u201d\r\n\r\nHotchkiss, however, was certain. He had found the room and listened\r\noutside the door to the sleeper's heavy breathing, and so we climbed\r\npast luxurious suites, revealed in the deepening daylight, past long\r\nvistas of hall and boudoir. And we were both badly winded when we got\r\nthere. It was a tower room, reached by narrow stairs, and well above the\r\nroof level. Hotchkiss was glowing.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is partly good luck, but not all,\u201d he panted in a whisper. \u201cIf we\r\nhad persisted in the search last night, he would have taken alarm and\r\nfled. Now--we have him. Are you ready?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe gave a mighty rap at the door with the fire tongs, and stood\r\nexpectant. Certainly he was right; some one moved within.\r\n\r\n\u201cHello! Hello there!\u201d Hotchkiss bawled. \u201cYou might as well come out. We\r\nwon't hurt you, if you'll come peaceably.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTell him we represent the law,\u201d I prompted. \u201cThat's the customary\r\nthing, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut at that moment a bullet came squarely through the door and flattened\r\nitself with a sharp pst against the wall of the tower staircase. We\r\nducked unanimously, dropped back out of range, and Hotchkiss retaliated\r\nwith a spirited bang at the door with the tongs. This brought another\r\nbullet. It was a ridiculous situation. Under the circumstances, no\r\ndoubt, we should have retired, at least until we had armed ourselves,\r\nbut Hotchkiss had no end of fighting spirit, and as for me, my blood was\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\u201cBreak the lock,\u201d I suggested, and Hotchkiss, standing at the side, out\r\nof range, retaliated for every bullet by a smashing blow with the tongs.\r\nThe shots ceased after a half dozen, and the door was giving, slowly.\r\nOne of us on each side of the door, we were ready for almost any kind\r\nof desperate resistance. As it swung open Hotchkiss poised the tongs; I\r\nstood, bent forward, my arm drawn back for a blow.\r\n\r\nNothing happened.\r\n\r\nThere was not a sound. Finally, at the risk of losing an eye which I\r\njustly value, I peered around and into the room. There was no desperado\r\nthere: only a fresh-faced, trembling-lipped servant, sitting on the edge\r\nof her bed, with a quilt around her shoulders and the empty revolver at\r\nher feet.\r\n\r\nWe were victorious, but no conquered army ever beat such a retreat\r\nas ours down the tower stairs and into the refuge of the living-room.\r\nThere, with the door closed, sprawled on the divan, I went from one\r\nspasm of mirth into another, becoming sane at intervals, and suffering\r\nrelapse again every time I saw Hotchkiss' disgruntled countenance. He\r\nwas pacing the room, the tongs still in his hand, his mouth pursed\r\nwith irritation. Finally he stopped in front of me and compelled my\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you have finished cackling,\u201d he said with dignity, \u201cI wish to\r\njustify my position. Do you think the--er--young woman up-stairs put\r\na pair of number eight boots to dry in the library last night? Do you\r\nthink she poured the whisky out of that decanter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have been known to do it,\u201d I put in, but his eye silenced me.\r\n\r\n\u201cMoreover, if she had been the person who peered at you over the\r\ngallery railing last night, don't you suppose, with her--er--belligerent\r\ndisposition, she could have filled you as full of lead as a window\r\nweight?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do,\u201d I assented. \u201cIt wasn't Alice-sit-by-the-fire. I grant you that.\r\nThen who was it?\u201d\r\n\r\nHotchkiss felt certain that it had been Sullivan, but I was not so sure.\r\nWhy would he have crawled like a thief into his own house? If he had\r\ncrossed the park, as seemed probable, when we did, he had not made any\r\nattempt to use the knocker. I gave it up finally, and made an effort to\r\nconciliate the young woman in the tower.\r\n\r\nWe had heard no sound since our spectacular entrance into her room. I\r\nwas distinctly uncomfortable as, alone this time, I climbed to the tower\r\nstaircase. Reasoning from before, she would probably throw a chair at\r\nme. I stopped at the foot of the staircase and called.\r\n\r\n\u201cHello up there,\u201d I said, in as debonair a manner as I could summon.\r\n\u201cGood morning. Wie geht es bei ihen?\u201d\r\n\r\nNo reply.\r\n\r\n\u201cBon jour, mademoiselle,\u201d I tried again. This time there was a movement\r\nof some sort from above, but nothing fell on me.\r\n\r\n\u201cI--we want to apologize for rousing you so--er--unexpectedly this\r\nmorning,\u201d I went on. \u201cThe fact is, we wanted to talk to you, and\r\nyou--you were hard to waken. We are travelers, lost in your mountains,\r\nand we crave a breakfast and an audience.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe came to the door then. I could feel that she was investigating the\r\ntop of my head from above. \u201cIs Mr. Sullivan with you?\u201d she asked. It was\r\nthe first word from her, and she was not sure of her voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. We are alone. If you will come down and look at us you will find\r\nus two perfectly harmless people, whose horse--curses on him--departed\r\nwithout leave last night and left us at your gate.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe relaxed somewhat then and came down a step or two. \u201cI was afraid I\r\nhad killed somebody,\u201d she said. \u201cThe housekeeper left yesterday, and the\r\nother maids went with her.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen she saw that I was comparatively young and lacked the earmarks of\r\nthe highwayman, she was greatly relieved. She was inclined to fight shy\r\nof Hotchkiss, however, for some reason. She gave us a breakfast of a\r\nsort, for there was little in the house, and afterward we telephoned to\r\nthe town for a vehicle. While Hotchkiss examined scratches and replaced\r\nthe Bokhara rug, I engaged Jennie in conversation.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you tell me,\u201d I asked, \u201cwho is managing the estate since Mrs.\r\nCurtis was killed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo one,\u201d she returned shortly.\r\n\r\n\u201cHas--any member of the family been here since the accident?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir. There was only the two, and some think Mr. Sullivan was killed\r\nas well as his sister.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don't?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d with conviction.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe wheeled on me with quick suspicion.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you a detective?\u201d she demanded.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou told him to say you represented the law.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am a lawyer. Some of them misrepresent the law, but I--\u201d\r\n\r\nShe broke in impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cA sheriff's officer?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. Look here, Jennie; I am all that I should be. You'll have to\r\nbelieve that. And I'm in a bad position through no fault of my own. I\r\nwant you to answer some questions. If you will help me, I will do what I\r\ncan for you. Do you live near here?\u201d\r\n\r\nHer chin quivered. It was the first sign of weakness she had shown.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy home is in Pittsburg,\u201d she said, \u201cand I haven't enough money to\r\nget there. They hadn't paid any wages for two months. They didn't pay\r\nanybody.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d I returned. \u201cI'll send you back to Pittsburg, Pullman\r\nincluded, if you will tell me some things I want to know.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe agreed eagerly. Outside the window Hotchkiss was bending over,\r\nexamining footprints in the drive.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d I began, \u201cthere has been a Miss West staying here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Sullivan was attentive to her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. She was the granddaughter of a wealthy man in Pittsburg. My aunt\r\nhas been in his family for twenty years. Mrs. Curtis wanted her brother\r\nto marry Miss West.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you think he did marry her?\u201d I could not keep the excitement out of\r\nmy voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. There were reasons\u201d--she stopped abruptly.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know anything of the family? Are they--were they New Yorkers?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey came from somewhere in the south. I have heard Mrs. Curtis say her\r\nmother was a Cuban. I don't know much about them, but Mr. Sullivan had\r\na wicked temper, though he didn't look it. Folks say big, light-haired\r\npeople are easy going, but I don't believe it, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long was Miss West here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo weeks.\u201d\r\n\r\nI hesitated about further questioning. Critical as my position was, I\r\ncould not pry deeper into Alison West's affairs. If she had got into the\r\nhands of adventurers, as Sullivan and his sister appeared to have been,\r\nshe was safely away from them again. But something of the situation\r\nin the car Ontario was forming itself in my mind: the incident at the\r\nfarmhouse lacked only motive to be complete. Was Sullivan, after all, a\r\nrascal or a criminal? Was the murderer Sullivan or Mrs. Conway? The lady\r\nor the tiger again.\r\n\r\nJennie was speaking.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope Miss West was not hurt?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe liked her, all of us.\r\nShe was not like Mrs. Curtis.\u201d\r\n\r\nI wanted to say that she was not like anybody in the world.\r\nInstead--\u201cShe escaped with some bruises,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\nShe glanced at my arm. \u201cYou were on the train?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe waited for more questions, but none coming, she went to the door.\r\nThen she closed it softly and came back.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Curtis is dead? You are sure of it?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was killed instantly, I believe. The body was not recovered. But I\r\nhave reasons for believing that Mr. Sullivan is living.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d she said. \u201cI--I think he was here the night before last.\r\nThat is why I went to the tower room. I believe he would kill me if\r\nhe could.\u201d As nearly as her round and comely face could express\r\nit, Jennie's expression was tragic at that moment. I made a quick\r\nresolution, and acted on it at once.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are not entirely frank with me, Jennie,\u201d I protested. \u201cAnd I am\r\ngoing to tell you more than I have. We are talking at cross purposes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was on the wrecked train, in the same car with Mrs. Curtis, Miss West\r\nand Mr. Sullivan. During the night there was a crime committed in that\r\ncar and Mr. Sullivan disappeared. But he left behind him a chain of\r\ncircumstantial evidence that involved me completely, so that I may, at\r\nany time, be arrested.\u201d\r\n\r\nApparently she did not comprehend for a moment. Then, as if the meaning\r\nof my words had just dawned on her, she looked up and gasped:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean--Mr. Sullivan committed the crime himself?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think he did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat was it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was murder,\u201d I said deliberately.\r\n\r\nHer hands clenched involuntarily, and she shrank back. \u201cA woman?\u201d She\r\ncould scarcely form her words.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, a man; a Mr. Simon Harrington, of Pittsburg.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer effort to retain her self-control was pitiful. Then she broke down\r\nand cried, her head on the back of a tall chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was my fault,\u201d she said wretchedly, \u201cmy fault, I should not have\r\nsent them the word.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes she grew quiet. She seemed to hesitate over\r\nsomething, and finally determined to say it.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will understand better, sir, when I say that I was raised in the\r\nHarrington family. Mr. Harrington was Mr. Sullivan's wife's father!\u201d\r\n\nSo it had been the tiger, not the lady! Well, I had held to that theory\r\nall through. Jennie suddenly became a valuable person; if necessary she\r\ncould prove the connection between Sullivan and the murdered man, and\r\nshow a motive for the crime. I was triumphant when Hotchkiss came in.\r\nWhen the girl had produced a photograph of Mrs. Sullivan, and I had\r\nrecognized the bronze-haired girl of the train, we were both well\r\nsatisfied--which goes to prove the ephemeral nature of most human\r\ncontentments.\r\n\r\nJennie either had nothing more to say, or feared she had said too much.\r\nShe was evidently uneasy before Hotchkiss. I told her that Mrs. Sullivan\r\nwas recovering in a Baltimore hospital, but she already knew it, from\r\nsome source, and merely nodded. She made a few preparations for leaving,\r\nwhile Hotchkiss and I compared notes, and then, with the cat in her\r\narms, she climbed into the trap from the town. I sat with her, and on\r\nthe way down she told me a little, not much.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you see Mrs. Sullivan,\u201d she advised, \u201cand she is conscious, she\r\nprobably thinks that both her husband and her father were killed in the\r\nwreck. She will be in a bad way, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean that she--still cares about her husband?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe cat crawled over on to my knee, and rubbed its head against my hand\r\ninvitingly. Jennie stared at the undulating line of the mountain crests,\r\na colossal sun against a blue ocean of sky. \u201cYes, she cares,\u201d she said\r\nsoftly. \u201cWomen are made like that. They say they are cats, but Peter\r\nthere in your lap wouldn't come back and lick your hand if you kicked\r\nhim. If--if you have to tell her the truth, be as gentle as you can,\r\nsir. She has been good to me--that's why I have played the spy here all\r\nsummer. It's a thankless thing, spying on people.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is that,\u201d I agreed soberly.\r\n\r\nHotchkiss and I arrived in Washington late that evening, and, rather\r\nthan arouse the household, I went to the club. I was at the office early\r\nthe next morning and admitted myself. McKnight rarely appeared before\r\nhalf after ten, and our modest office force some time after nine. I\r\nlooked over my previous day's mail and waited, with such patience as I\r\npossessed, for McKnight. In the interval I called up Mrs. Klopton\r\nand announced that I would dine at home that night. What my household\r\nsubsists on during my numerous absences I have never discovered. Tea,\r\nprobably, and crackers. Diligent search when I have made a midnight\r\narrival, never reveals anything more substantial. Possibly I imagine it,\r\nbut the announcement that I am about to make a journey always seems\r\nto create a general atmosphere of depression throughout the house,\r\nas though Euphemia and Eliza, and Thomas, the stableman, were already\r\nsubsisting, in imagination, on Mrs. Klopton's meager fare.\r\n\r\nSo I called her up and announced my arrival. There was something unusual\r\nin her tone, as though her throat was tense with indignation. Always\r\nshrill, her elderly voice rasped my ear painfully through the receiver.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have changed the butcher, Mr. Lawrence,\u201d she announced portentously.\r\n\u201cThe last roast was a pound short, and his mutton-chops--any\r\nself-respecting sheep would refuse to acknowledge them.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs I said before, I can always tell from the voice in which Mrs. Klopton\r\nconveys the most indifferent matters, if something of real significance\r\nhas occurred. Also, through long habit, I have learned how quickest to\r\nbring her to the point.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are pessimistic this morning,\u201d I returned. \u201cWhat's the matter, Mrs.\r\nKlopton? You haven't used that tone since Euphemia baked a pie for the\r\niceman. What is it now? Somebody poison the dog?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe cleared her throat.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe house has been broken into, Mr. Lawrence,\u201d she said. \u201cI have lived\r\nin the best families, and never have I stood by and seen what I\r\nsaw yesterday--every bureau drawer opened, and my--my most sacred\r\nbelongings--\u201d she choked.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you notify the police?\u201d I asked sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cPolice!\u201d she sniffed. \u201cPolice! It was the police that did it--two\r\ndetectives with a search warrant. I--I wouldn't dare tell you over the\r\ntelephone what one of them said when he found the whisky and rock candy\r\nfor my cough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid they take anything?\u201d I demanded, every nerve on edge.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey took the cough medicine,\u201d she returned indignantly, \u201cand they\r\nsaid--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cConfound the cough medicine!\u201d I was frantic. \u201cDid they take anything\r\nelse? Were they in my dressing-room?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I threatened to sue them, and I told them what you would do when\r\nyou came back. But they wouldn't listen. They took away that black\r\nsealskin bag you brought home from Pittsburg with you!\u201d\r\n\r\nI knew then that my hours of freedom were numbered. To have found\r\nSullivan and then, in support of my case against him, to have produced\r\nthe bag, minus the bit of chain, had been my intention. But the police\r\nhad the bag, and, beyond knowing something of Sullivan's history, I was\r\npractically no nearer his discovery than before. Hotchkiss hoped he had\r\nhis man in the house off Washington Circle, but on the very night he had\r\nseen him Jennie claimed that Sullivan had tried to enter the Laurels.\r\nThen--suppose we found Sullivan and proved the satchel and its contents\r\nhis? Since the police had the bit of chain it might mean involving\r\nAlison in the story. I sat down and buried my face in my hands. There\r\nwas no escape. I figured it out despondingly.\r\n\r\nAgainst me was the evidence of the survivors of the Ontario that I had\r\nbeen accused of the murder at the time. There had been blood-stains on\r\nmy pillow and a hidden dagger. Into the bargain, in my possession had\r\nbeen found a traveling-bag containing the dead man's pocket-book.\r\n\r\nIn my favor was McKnight's theory against Mrs. Conway. She had a motive\r\nfor wishing to secure the notes, she believed I was in lower ten, and\r\nshe had collapsed at the discovery of the crime in the morning.\r\n\r\nAgainst both of these theories, I accuse a purely chimerical person\r\nnamed Sullivan, who was not seen by any of the survivors--save one,\r\nAlison, whom I could not bring into the case. I could find a motive for\r\nhis murdering his father-in-law, whom he hated, but again--I would have\r\nto drag in the girl.\r\n\r\nAnd not one of the theories explained the telegram and the broken\r\nnecklace.\r\n\r\nOutside the office force was arriving. They were comfortably ignorant\r\nof my presence, and over the transom floated scraps of dialogue and the\r\nstenographer's gurgling laugh. McKnight had a relative, who was reading\r\nlaw with him, in the intervals between calling up the young women of his\r\nacquaintance. He came in singing, and the office boy joined in with the\r\nuncertainty of voice of fifteen. I smiled grimly. I was too busy with my\r\nown troubles to find any joy in opening the door and startling them into\r\nsilence. I even heard, without resentment, Blobs of the uncertain voice\r\ninquire when \u201cBlake\u201d would be back.\r\n\r\nI hoped McKnight would arrive before the arrest occurred. There were\r\nmany things to arrange. But when at last, impatient of his delay, I\r\ntelephoned, I found he had been gone for more than an hour. Clearly he\r\nwas not coming directly to the office, and with such resignation as I\r\ncould muster I paced the floor and waited.\r\n\r\nI felt more alone than I have ever felt in my life. \u201cBorn an orphan,\u201d\r\n as Richey said, I had made my own way, carved out myself such success as\r\nhad been mine. I had built up my house of life on the props of law and\r\norder, and now some unknown hand had withdrawn the supports, and I stood\r\namong ruins.\r\n\r\nI suppose it is the maternal in a woman that makes a man turn to her\r\nwhen everything else fails. The eternal boy in him goes to have his\r\nwounded pride bandaged, his tattered self-respect repaired. If he loves\r\nthe woman, he wants her to kiss the hurt.\r\n\r\nThe longing to see Alison, always with me, was stronger than I was that\r\nmorning. It might be that I would not see her again. I had nothing to\r\nsay to her save one thing, and that, under the cloud that hung over me,\r\nI did not dare to say. But I wanted to see her, to touch her hand--as\r\nonly a lonely man can crave it, I wanted the comfort of her, the peace\r\nthat lay in her presence. And so, with every step outside the door a\r\nthreat, I telephoned to her.\r\n\r\nShe was gone! The disappointment was great, for my need was great. In\r\na fury of revolt against the scheme of things, I heard that she had\r\nstarted home to Richmond--but that she might still be caught at the\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nTo see her had by that time become an obsession. I picked up my hat,\r\nthrew open the door, and, oblivious of the shock to the office force\r\nof my presence, followed so immediately by my exit, I dashed out to the\r\nelevator. As I went down in one cage I caught a glimpse of Johnson and\r\ntwo other men going up in the next. I hardly gave them a thought. There\r\nwas no hansom in sight, and I jumped on a passing car. Let come what\r\nmight, arrest, prison, disgrace, I was going to see Alison.\r\n\r\nI saw her. I flung into the station, saw that it was empty--empty, for\r\nshe was not there. Then I hurried back to the gates. She was there, a\r\nfamiliar figure in blue, the very gown in which I always thought of\r\nher, the one she had worn when, Heaven help me--I had kissed her, at the\r\nCarter farm. And she was not alone. Bending over her, talking earnestly,\r\nwith all his boyish heart in his face, was Richey.\r\n\r\nThey did not see me, and I was glad of it. After all, it had been\r\nMcKnight's game first. I turned on my heel and made my way blindly out\r\nof the station. Before I lost them I turned once and looked toward them,\r\nstanding apart from the crowd, absorbed in each other. They were the\r\nonly two people on earth that I cared about, and I left them there\r\ntogether. Then I went back miserably to the office and awaited arrest.\r\n\nStrangely enough, I was not disturbed that day. McKnight did not appear\r\nat all. I sat at my desk and transacted routine business all afternoon,\r\nworking with feverish energy. Like a man on the verge of a critical\r\nillness or a hazardous journey, I cleared up my correspondence, paid\r\nbills until I had writer's cramp from signing checks, read over my will,\r\nand paid up my life insurance, made to the benefit of an elderly sister\r\nof my mother's. I no longer dreaded arrest. After that morning in the\r\nstation, I felt that anything would be a relief from the tension. I\r\nwent home with perfect openness, courting the warrant that I knew was\r\nwaiting, but I was not molested. The delay puzzled me. The early part of\r\nthe evening was uneventful. I read until late, with occasional lapses,\r\nwhen my book lay at my elbow, and I smoked and thought. Mrs. Klopton\r\nclosed the house with ostentatious caution, about eleven, and hung\r\naround waiting to enlarge on the outrageousness of the police search. I\r\ndid not encourage her.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne would think,\u201d she concluded pompously, one foot in the hall, \u201cthat\r\nyou were something you oughtn't to be, Mr. Lawrence. They acted as\r\nthough you had committed a crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm not sure that I didn't, Mrs. Klopton,\u201d I said wearily. \u201cSomebody\r\ndid, the general verdict seems to point my way.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stared at me in speechless indignation. Then she flounced out. She\r\ncame back once to say that the paper predicted cooler weather, and that\r\nshe had put a blanket on my bed, but, to her disappointment, I refused\r\nto reopen the subject.\r\n\r\nAt half past eleven McKnight and Hotchkiss came in. Richey has a habit\r\nof stopping his car in front of the house and honking until some\r\none comes out. He has a code of signals with the horn, which I never\r\nremember. Two long and a short blast mean, I believe, \u201cSend out a box of\r\ncigarettes,\u201d and six short blasts, which sound like a police call, mean\r\n\u201cCan you lend me some money?\u201d To-night I knew something was up, for he\r\ngot out and rang the door-bell like a Christian.\r\n\r\nThey came into the library, and Hotchkiss wiped his collar until it\r\ngleamed. McKnight was aggressively cheerful.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot pinched yet!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWhat do you think of that for luck!\r\nYou always were a fortunate devil, Lawrence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I assented, with some bitterness, \u201cI hardly know how to contain\r\nmyself for joy sometimes. I suppose you know\u201d--to Hotchkiss--\u201cthat the\r\npolice were here while we were at Cresson, and that they found the bag\r\nthat I brought from the wreck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThings are coming to a head,\u201d he said thoughtfully \u201cunless a little\r\nplan that I have in mind--\u201d he hesitated.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope so; I am pretty nearly desperate,\u201d I said doggedly. \u201cI've got a\r\nmental toothache, and the sooner it's pulled the better.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTut, tut,\u201d said McKnight, \u201cthink of the disgrace to the firm if its\r\nsenior member goes up for life, or--\u201d he twisted his handkerchief into a\r\nnoose, and went through an elaborate pantomime.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlthough jail isn't so bad, anyhow,\u201d he finished, \u201cthere are fellows\r\nthat get the habit and keep going back and going back.\u201d He looked at\r\nhis watch, and I fancied his cheerfulness was strained. Hotchkiss was\r\nnervously fumbling my book.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you ever read The Purloined Letter, Mr. Blakeley?\u201d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\u201cProbably, years ago,\u201d I said. \u201cPoe, isn't it?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was choked at my indifference. \u201cIt is a masterpiece,\u201d he said, with\r\nenthusiasm. \u201cI re-read it to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what happened?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I inspected the rooms in the house off Washington Circle. I--I\r\nmade some discoveries, Mr. Blakeley. For one thing, our man there is\r\nleft-handed.\u201d He looked around for our approval. \u201cThere was a small\r\ncushion on the dresser, and the scarf pins in it had been stuck in with\r\nthe left hand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSomebody may have twisted the cushion,\u201d I objected, but he looked hurt,\r\nand I desisted.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is only one discrepancy,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut it troubles me.\r\nAccording to Mrs. Carter, at the farmhouse, our man wore gaudy pajamas,\r\nwhile I found here only the most severely plain night-shirts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAny buttons off?\u201d McKnight inquired, looking again at his watch.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe buttons were there,\u201d the amateur detective answered gravely, \u201cbut\r\nthe buttonhole next the top one was torn through.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcKnight winked at me furtively.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am convinced of one thing,\u201d Hotchkiss went on, clearing his throat,\r\n\u201cthe papers are not in that room. Either he carries them with him, or he\r\nhas sold them.\u201d\r\n\r\nA sound on the street made both my visitors listen sharply. Whatever it\r\nwas it passed on, however. I was growing curious and the restraint was\r\ntelling on McKnight. He has no talent for secrecy. In the interval\r\nwe discussed the strange occurrence at Cresson, which lost nothing by\r\nHotchkiss' dry narration.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthe woman in the Baltimore hospital is the wife\r\nof Henry Sullivan and the daughter of the man he murdered. No wonder he\r\ncollapsed when he heard of the wreck.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJoy, probably,\u201d McKnight put in. \u201cIs that clock right, Lawrence? Never\r\nmind, it doesn't matter. By the way, Mrs. Conway dropped in the office\r\nyesterday, while you were away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d I sprang from my chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cSure thing. Said she had heard great things of us, and wanted us to\r\nhandle her case against the railroad.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would like to know what she is driving at,\u201d I reflected. \u201cIs she\r\ntrying to reach me through you?\u201d\r\n\r\nRichey's flippancy is often a cloak for deeper feeling. He dropped it\r\nnow. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cshe's after the notes, of course. And I'll tell\r\nyou I felt like a poltroon--whatever that may be--when I turned\r\nher down. She stood by the door with her face white, and told me\r\ncontemptuously that I could save you from a murder charge and wouldn't\r\ndo it. She made me feel like a cur. I was just as guilty as if I could\r\nhave obliged her. She hinted that there were reasons and she laid my\r\nattitude to beastly motives.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d I said, as easily as I could. Hotchkiss had gone to the\r\nwindow. \u201cShe was excited. There are no 'reasons,' whatever she means.\u201d\r\n\r\nRichey put his hand on my shoulder. \u201cWe've been together too long to\r\nlet any 'reasons' or 'unreasons' come between us, old man,\u201d he said, not\r\nvery steadily. Hotchkiss, who had been silent, here came forward in\r\nhis most impressive manner. He put his hands under his coat-tails and\r\ncoughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Blakeley,\u201d he began, \u201cby Mr. McKnight's advice we have arranged a\r\nlittle interview here to-night. If all has gone as I planned, Mr.\r\nHenry Pinckney Sullivan is by this time under arrest. Within a very few\r\nminutes--he will be here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wanted to talk to him before he was locked up,\u201d Richey explained.\r\n\u201cHe's clever enough to be worth knowing, and, besides, I'm not so\r\ncocksure of his guilt as our friend the Patch on the Seat of Government.\r\nNo murderer worthy of the name needs six different motives for the\r\nsame crime, beginning with robbery, and ending with an unpleasant\r\nfather-in-law.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe were all silent for a while. McKnight stationed himself at a window,\r\nand Hotchkiss paced the floor expectantly. \u201cIt's a great day for modern\r\ndetective methods,\u201d he chirruped. \u201cWhile the police have been guarding\r\nhouses and standing with their mouths open waiting for clues to fall in\r\nand choke them, we have pieced together, bit by bit, a fabric--\u201d\r\n\r\nThe door-bell rang, followed immediately by sounds of footsteps in the\r\nhall. McKnight threw the door open, and Hotchkiss, raised on his toes,\r\nflung out his arm in a gesture of superb eloquence.\r\n\r\n\u201cBehold--your man!\u201d he declaimed.\r\n\r\nThrough the open doorway came a tall, blond fellow, clad in light gray,\r\nwearing tan shoes, and followed closely by an officer.\r\n\r\n\u201cI brought him here as you suggested, Mr. McKnight,\u201d said the constable.\r\n\r\nBut McKnight was doubled over the library table in silent convulsions of\r\nmirth, and I was almost as bad. Little Hotchkiss stood up, his important\r\nattitude finally changing to one of chagrin, while the blond man ceased\r\nto look angry, and became sheepish.\r\n\r\nIt was Stuart, our confidential clerk for the last half dozen years!\r\n\r\nMcKnight sat up and wiped his eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cStuart,\u201d he said sternly, \u201cthere are two very serious things we have\r\nlearned about you. First, you jab your scarf pins into your cushion\r\nwith your left hand, which is most reprehensible; second, you\r\nwear--er--night-shirts, instead of pajamas. Worse than that, perhaps, we\r\nfind that one of them has a buttonhole torn out at the neck.\u201d\r\n\r\nStuart was bewildered. He looked from McKnight to me, and then at the\r\ncrestfallen Hotchkiss.\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven't any idea what it's all about,\u201d he said. \u201cI was arrested as\r\nI reached my boarding-house to-night, after the theater, and brought\r\ndirectly here. I told the officer it was a mistake.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoor Hotchkiss tried bravely to justify the fiasco. \u201cYou can not deny,\u201d\r\n he contended, \u201cthat Mr. Andrew Bronson followed you to your rooms last\r\nMonday evening.\u201d\r\n\r\nStuart looked at us and flushed.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don't deny it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there was nothing criminal about\r\nit, on my part, at least. Mr. Bronson has been trying to induce me to\r\nsecure the forged notes for him. But I did not even know where they\r\nwere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you were not on the wrecked Washington Flier?\u201d persisted Hotchkiss.\r\nBut McKnight interfered.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no use trying to put the other man's identity on Stuart, Mr.\r\nHotchkiss,\u201d he protested. \u201cHe has been our confidential clerk for six\r\nyears, and has not been away from the office a day for a year. I am\r\nafraid that the beautiful fabric we have pieced out of all these scraps\r\nis going to be a crazy quilt.\u201d His tone was facetious, but I could\r\ndetect the undercurrent of real disappointment.\r\n\r\nI paid the constable for his trouble, and he departed. Stuart, still\r\nindignant, left to go back to Washington Circle. He shook hands with\r\nMcKnight and myself magnanimously, but he hurled a look of utter hatred\r\nat Hotchkiss, sunk crestfallen in his chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs far as I can see,\u201d said McKnight dryly, \u201cwe're exactly as far along\r\nas we were the day we met at the Carter place. We're not a step nearer\r\nto finding our man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have one thing that may be of value,\u201d I suggested. \u201cHe is the\r\nhusband of a bronze-haired woman at Van Kirk's hospital, and it is just\r\npossible we may trace him through her. I hope we are not going to lose\r\nyour valuable co-operation, Mr. Hotchkiss?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\nHe roused at that to feeble interest, \u201cI--oh, of course not, if you\r\nstill care to have me, I--I was wondering about--the man who just went\r\nout, Stuart, you say? I--told his landlady to-night that he wouldn't\r\nneed the room again. I hope she hasn't rented it to somebody else.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe cheered him as best we could, and I suggested that we go to Baltimore\r\nthe next day and try to find the real Sullivan through his wife. He left\r\nsometime after midnight, and Richey and I were alone.\r\n\r\nHe drew a chair near the lamp and lighted a cigarette, and for a time we\r\nwere silent. I was in the shadow, and I sat back and watched him. It\r\nwas not surprising, I thought, that she cared for him: women had always\r\nloved him, perhaps because he always loved them. There was no disloyalty\r\nin the thought: it was the lad's nature to give and crave affection.\r\nOnly--I was different. I had never really cared about a girl before,\r\nand my life had been singularly loveless. I had fought a lonely battle\r\nalways. Once before, in college, we had both laid ourselves and our\r\ncallow devotions at the feet of the same girl. Her name was Dorothy--I\r\nhad forgotten the rest--but I remembered the sequel. In a spirit of\r\nquixotic youth I had relinquished my claim in favor of Richey and had\r\ngone cheerfully on my way, elevated by my heroic sacrifice to a somber,\r\nwhite-hot martyrdom. As is often the case, McKnight's first words showed\r\nour parallel lines of thought.\r\n\r\n\u201cI say, Lollie,\u201d he asked, \u201cdo you remember Dorothy Browne?\u201d Browne,\r\nthat was it!\r\n\r\n\u201cDorothy Browne?\u201d I repeated. \u201cOh--why yes, I recall her now. Why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI was thinking about her. That's all. You remember\r\nyou were crazy about her, and dropped back because she preferred me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI got out,\u201d I said with dignity, \u201cbecause you declared you would shoot\r\nyourself if she didn't go with you to something or other!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, why yes, I recall now!\u201d he mimicked. He tossed his cigarette in\r\nthe general direction of the hearth and got up. We were both a little\r\nconscious, and he stood with his back to me, fingering a Japanese vase\r\non the mantel.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was thinking,\u201d he began, turning the vase around, \u201cthat, if you feel\r\npretty well again, and--and ready to take hold, that I should like to go\r\naway for a week or so. Things are fairly well cleaned up at the office.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean--you are going to Richmond?\u201d I asked, after a scarcely\r\nperceptible pause. He turned and faced me, with his hands thrust in his\r\npockets.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. That's off, Lollie. The Sieberts are going for a week's cruise\r\nalong the coast. I--the hot weather has played hob with me and the\r\ncruise means seven days' breeze and bridge.\u201d\r\n\r\nI lighted a cigarette and offered him the box, but he refused. He was\r\nlooking haggard and suddenly tired. I could not think of anything to\r\nsay, and neither could he, evidently. The matter between us lay too deep\r\nfor speech.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow's Candida?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cMartin says a month, and she will be all right,\u201d I returned, in the\r\nsame tone. He picked up his hat, but he had something more to say. He\r\nblurted it out, finally, half way to the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Seiberts are not going for a couple of days,\u201d he said, \u201cand if you\r\nwant a day or so off to go down to Richmond yourself--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps I shall,\u201d I returned, as indifferently as I could. \u201cNot going\r\nyet, are you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. It is late.\u201d He drew in his breath as if he had something more\r\nto say, but the impulse passed. \u201cWell, good night,\u201d he said from the\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood night, old man.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe next moment the outer door slammed and I heard the engine of the\r\nCannonball throbbing in the street. Then the quiet settled down around\r\nme again, and there in the lamplight I dreamed dreams. I was going to\r\nsee her.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the idea of being shut away, even temporarily, from so great\r\nand wonderful a world became intolerable. The possibility of arrest\r\nbefore I could get to Richmond was hideous, the night without end.\r\n\r\nI made my escape the next morning through the stable back of the house,\r\nand then, by devious dark and winding ways, to the office. There, after\r\na conference with Blobs, whose features fairly jerked with excitement,\r\nI double-locked the door of my private office and finished off some\r\nimperative work. By ten o'clock I was free, and for the twentieth time\r\nI consulted my train schedule. At five minutes after ten, with McKnight\r\nnot yet in sight, Blobs knocked at the door, the double rap we had\r\nagreed upon, and on being admitted slipped in and quietly closed the\r\ndoor behind him. His eyes were glistening with excitement, and a purple\r\ndab of typewriter ink gave him a peculiarly villainous and stealthy\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey're here,\u201d he said, \u201ctwo of 'em, and that crazy Stuart wasn't on,\r\nand said you were somewhere in the building.\u201d\r\n\r\nA door slammed outside, followed by steps on the uncarpeted outer\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis way,\u201d said Blobs, in a husky undertone, and, darting into a\r\nlavatory, threw open a door that I had always supposed locked. Thence\r\ninto a back hall piled high with boxes and past the presses of a\r\nbookbindery to the freight elevator.\r\n\r\nGreatly to Blobs' disappointment, there was no pursuit. I was\r\nexhilarated but out of breath when we emerged into an alleyway, and the\r\nsharp daylight shone on Blobs' excited face.\r\n\r\n\u201cGreat sport, isn't it?\u201d I panted, dropping a dollar into his\r\npalm, inked to correspond with his face. \u201cRegular walk-away in the\r\nhundred-yard dash.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGimme two dollars more and I'll drop 'em down the elevator shaft,\u201d he\r\nsuggested ferociously. I left him there with his blood-thirsty schemes,\r\nand started for the station. I had a tendency to look behind me now and\r\nthen, but I reached the station unnoticed. The afternoon was hot, the\r\ntrain rolled slowly along, stopping to pant at sweltering stations,\r\nfrom whose roofs the heat rose in waves. But I noticed these things\r\nobjectively, not subjectively, for at the end of the journey was a girl\r\nwith blue eyes and dark brown hair, hair that could--had I not seen\r\nit?--hang loose in bewitching tangles or be twisted into little coils of\r\ndelight.\r\n\nI telephoned as soon as I reached my hotel, and I had not known how much\r\nI had hoped from seeing her until I learned that she was out of town. I\r\nhung up the receiver, almost dizzy with disappointment, and it was fully\r\nfive minutes before I thought of calling up again and asking if she was\r\nwithin telephone reach. It seemed she was down on the bay staying with\r\nthe Samuel Forbeses.\r\n\r\nSammy Forbes! It was a name to conjure with just then. In the old days\r\nat college I had rather flouted him, but now I was ready to take him to\r\nmy heart. I remembered that he had always meant well, anyhow, and that\r\nhe was explosively generous. I called him up.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the fumes of gasoline!\u201d he said, when I told him who I was.\r\n\u201cBlakeley, the Fount of Wisdom against Woman! Blakeley, the Great\r\nUnkissed! Welcome to our city!\u201d\r\n\r\nWhereupon he proceeded to urge me to come down to the Shack, and to say\r\nthat I was an agreeable surprise, because four times in two hours\r\nyouths had called up to ask if Alison West was stopping with him, and\r\nto suggest that they had a vacant day or two. \u201cOh--Miss West!\u201d I shouted\r\npolitely. There was a buzzing on the line. \u201cIs she there?\u201d Sam had no\r\nsuspicions. Was not I in his mind always the Great Unkissed?--which\r\nsounds like the Great Unwashed and is even more of a reproach. He asked\r\nme down promptly, as I had hoped, and thrust aside my objections.\r\n\r\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d he said. \u201cBring yourself. The lady that keeps my\r\nboarding-house is calling to me to insist. You remember Dorothy, don't\r\nyou, Dorothy Browne? She says unless you have lost your figure you\r\ncan wear my clothes all right. All you need here is a bathing suit for\r\ndaytime and a dinner coat for evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt sounds cool,\u201d I temporized. \u201cIf you are sure I won't put you\r\nout--very well, Sam, since you and your wife are good enough. I have a\r\ncouple of days free. Give my love to Dorothy until I can do it myself.\u201d\r\n\r\nSam met me himself and drove me out to the Shack, which proved to be a\r\nsubstantial house overlooking the water. On the way he confided to me\r\nthat lots of married men thought they were contented when they were\r\nmerely resigned, but that it was the only life, and that Sam, Junior,\r\ncould swim like a duck. Incidentally, he said that Alison was his wife's\r\ncousin, their respective grandmothers having, at proper intervals,\r\nmarried the same man, and that Alison would lose her good looks if she\r\nwas not careful.\r\n\r\n\u201cI say she's worried, and I stick to it,\u201d he said, as he threw the lines\r\nto a groom and prepared to get out. \u201cYou know her, and she's the kind\r\nof girl you think you can read like a book. But you can't; don't fool\r\nyourself. Take a good look at her at dinner, Blake; you won't lose your\r\nhead like the other fellows--and then tell me what's wrong with her.\r\nWe're mighty fond of Allie.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe went ponderously up the steps, for Sam had put on weight since I knew\r\nhim. At the door he turned around. \u201cDo you happen to know the MacLures\r\nat Seal Harbor?\u201d he asked irrelevantly, but Mrs. Sam came into the hall\r\njust then, both hands out to greet me, and, whatever Forbes had meant to\r\nsay, he did not pick up the subject again.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are having tea in here,\u201d Dorothy said gaily, indicating the door\r\nbehind her. \u201cTea by courtesy, because I think tea is the only beverage\r\nthat isn't represented. And then we must dress, for this is hop night at\r\nthe club.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich is as great a misnomer as the tea,\u201d Sam put in, ponderously\r\nstruggling out of his linen driving coat. \u201cIt's bridge night, and the\r\nonly hops are in the beer.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was still gurgling over this as he took me upstairs. He showed me my\r\nroom himself, and then began the fruitless search for evening raiment\r\nthat kept me home that night from the club. For I couldn't wear Sam's\r\nclothes. That was clear, after a perspiring seance of a half hour.\r\n\r\n\u201cI won't do it, Sam,\u201d I said, when I had draped his dress-coat on me\r\ntoga fashion. \u201cWho am I to have clothing to spare, like this, when many\r\na poor chap hasn't even a cellar door to cover him. I won't do it; I'm\r\nselfish, but not that selfish.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLord,\u201d he said, wiping his face, \u201chow you've kept your figure! I can't\r\nwear a belt any more; got to have suspenders.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe reflected over his grievance for some time, sitting on the side of\r\nthe bed. \u201cYou could go as you are,\u201d he said finally. \u201cWe do it all the\r\ntime, only to-night happens to be the annual something or other, and--\u201d\r\n he trailed off into silence, trying to buckle my belt around him. \u201cA\r\ngood six inches,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI never get into a hansom cab any more\r\nthat I don't expect to see the horse fly up into the air. Well,\r\nAllie isn't going either. She turned down Granger this afternoon, the\r\nAnnapolis fellow you met on the stairs, pigeon-breasted chap--and she\r\nalways gets a headache on those occasions.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe got up heavily and went to the door. \u201cGranger is leaving,\u201d he said,\r\n\u201cI may be able to get his dinner coat for you. How well do you know\r\nher?\u201d he asked, with his hand on the knob.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you mean Dolly--?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlison.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFairly well,\u201d I said cautiously. \u201cNot as well as I would like to. I\r\ndined with her last week in Washington. And--I knew her before that.\u201d\r\n\r\nForbes touched the bell instead of going out, and told the servant who\r\nanswered to see if Mr. Granger's suitcase had gone. If not, to bring it\r\nacross the hall. Then he came back to his former position on the bed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, we feel responsible for Allie--near relation and all that,\u201d he\r\nbegan pompously. \u201cAnd we can't talk to the people here at the\r\nhouse--all the men are in love with her, and all the women are jealous.\r\nThen--there's a lot of money, too, or will be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cConfound the money!\u201d I muttered. \u201cThat is--nothing. Razor slipped.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can tell you,\u201d he went on, \u201cbecause you don't lose your head over\r\nevery pretty face--although Allie is more than that, of course. But\r\nabout a month ago she went away--to Seal Harbor, to visit Janet MacLure.\r\nKnow her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe came home to Richmond yesterday, and then came down here--Allie, I\r\nmean. And yesterday afternoon Dolly had a letter from Janet--something\r\nabout a second man--and saying she was disappointed not to have had\r\nAlison there, that she had promised them a two weeks' visit! What do\r\nyou make of that? And that isn't the worst. Allie herself wasn't in\r\nthe room, but there were eight other women, and because Dolly had put\r\nbelladonna in her eyes the night before to see how she would look, and\r\nas a result couldn't see anything nearer than across the room, some one\r\nread the letter aloud to her, and the whole story is out. One of the\r\ncats told Granger and the boy proposed to Allie to-day, to show her he\r\ndidn't care a tinker's dam where she had been.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood boy!\u201d I said, with enthusiasm. I liked the Granger fellow--since\r\nhe was out of the running. But Sam was looking at me with suspicion.\r\n\r\n\u201cBlake,\u201d he said, \u201cif I didn't know you for what you are, I'd say you\r\nwere interested there yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nBeing so near her, under the same roof, with even the tie of a dubious\r\nsecret between us, was making me heady. I pushed Forbes toward the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cI interested!\u201d I retorted, holding him by the shoulders. \u201cThere isn't a\r\nword in your vocabulary to fit my condition. I am an island in a sunlit\r\nsea of emotion, Sam, a--an empty place surrounded by longing--a--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAn empty place surrounded by longing!\u201d he retorted. \u201cYou want your\r\ndinner, that's what's the matter with you--\u201d\r\n\r\nI shut the door on him then. He seemed suddenly sordid. Dinner, I\r\nthought! Although, as matter of fact, I made a very fair meal when,\r\nGranger's suitcase not having gone, in his coat and some other man's\r\ntrousers, I was finally fit for the amenities. Alison did not come\r\ndown to dinner, so it was clear she would not go over to the club-house\r\ndance. I pled my injured arm and a ficticious, vaguely located sprain\r\nfrom the wreck, as an excuse for remaining at home. Sam regaled the\r\ntable with accounts of my distrust of women, my one love affair--with\r\nDorothy; to which I responded, as was expected, that only my failure\r\nthere had kept me single all these years, and that if Sam should be\r\nmysteriously missing during the bathing hour to-morrow, and so on.\r\n\r\nAnd when the endless meal was over, and yards of white veils had been\r\ntied over pounds of hair--or is it, too, bought by the yard?--and some\r\neight ensembles with their abject complements had been packed into three\r\nautomobiles and a trap, I drew a long breath and faced about. I had\r\njust then only one object in life--to find Alison, to assure her of my\r\nabsolute faith and confidence in her, and to offer my help and my poor\r\nself, if she would let me, in her service.\r\n\r\nShe was not easy to find. I searched the lower floor, the verandas and\r\nthe grounds, circumspectly. Then I ran into a little English girl who\r\nturned out to be her maid, and who also was searching. She was concerned\r\nbecause her mistress had had no dinner, and because the tray of food she\r\ncarried would soon be cold. I took the tray from her, on the glimpse of\r\nsomething white on the shore, and that was how I met the Girl again.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting on an over-turned boat, her chin in her hands, staring\r\nout to sea. The soft tide of the bay lapped almost at her feet, and the\r\ndraperies of her white gown melted hazily into the sands. She looked\r\nlike a wraith, a despondent phantom of the sea, although the adjective\r\nis redundant. Nobody ever thinks of a cheerful phantom. Strangely\r\nenough, considering her evident sadness, she was whistling softly to\r\nherself, over and over, some dreary little minor air that sounded like\r\na Bohemian dirge. She glanced up quickly when I made a misstep and my\r\ndishes jingled. All considered, the tray was out of the picture: the\r\nsea, the misty starlight, the girl, with her beauty--even the sad little\r\nwhistle that stopped now and then to go bravely on again, as though it\r\nfought against the odds of a trembling lip. And then I came, accompanied\r\nby a tray of little silver dishes that jingled and an unmistakable odor\r\nof broiled chicken!\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d she said quickly; and then, \u201cOh! I thought you were Jenkins.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTimeo Danaos--what's the rest of it?\u201d I asked, tendering my offering.\r\n\u201cYou didn't have any dinner, you know.\u201d I sat down beside her. \u201cSee,\r\nI'll be the table. What was the old fairy tale? 'Little goat bleat:\r\nlittle table appear!' I'm perfectly willing to be the goat, too.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was laughing rather tremulously.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe never do meet like other people, do we?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe really ought\r\nto shake hands and say how are you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't want to meet you like other people, and I suppose you always\r\nthink of me as wearing the other fellow's clothes,\u201d I returned meekly.\r\n\u201cI'm doing it again: I don't seem to be able to help it. These are\r\nGranger's that I have on now.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe threw back her head and laughed again, joyously, this time.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it's so ridiculous,\u201d she said, \u201cand you have never seen me when I\r\nwas not eating! It's too prosaic!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich reminds me that the chicken is getting cold, and the ice warm,\u201d\r\n I suggested. \u201cAt the time, I thought there could be no place better than\r\nthe farmhouse kitchen--but this is. I ordered all this for something I\r\nwant to say to you--the sea, the sand, the stars.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow alliterative you are!\u201d she said, trying to be flippant. \u201cYou are\r\nnot to say anything until I have had my supper. Look how the things are\r\nspilled around!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut she ate nothing, after all, and pretty soon I put the tray down in\r\nthe sand. I said little; there was no hurry. We were together, and time\r\nmeant nothing against that age-long wash of the sea. The air blew her\r\nhair in small damp curls against her face, and little by little the tide\r\nretreated, leaving our boat an oasis in a waste of gray sand.\r\n\r\n  \u201cIf seven maids with seven mops swept it for half a year\r\n  Do you suppose, the walrus said, that they could get it clear?\u201d\r\n\r\nshe threw at me once when she must have known I was going to speak. I\r\nheld her hand, and as long as I merely held it she let it lie warm in\r\nmine. But when I raised it to my lips, and kissed the soft, open palm,\r\nshe drew it away without displeasure.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot that, please,\u201d she protested, and fell to whistling softly again,\r\nher chin in her hands. \u201cI can't sing,\u201d she said, to break an awkward\r\npause, \u201cand so, when I'm fidgety, or have something on my mind, I\r\nwhistle. I hope you don't dislike it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI love it,\u201d I asserted warmly. I did; when she pursed her lips like\r\nthat I was mad to kiss them.\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw you--at the station,\u201d she said, suddenly. \u201cYou--you were in a\r\nhurry to go.\u201d I did not say anything, and after a pause she drew a long\r\nbreath. \u201cMen are queer, aren't they?\u201d she said, and fell to whistling\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAfter a while she sat up as if she had made a resolution. \u201cI am going\r\nto confess something,\u201d she announced suddenly. \u201cYou said, you know, that\r\nyou had ordered all this for something you--you wanted to say to me.\r\nBut the fact is, I fixed it all--came here, I mean, because--I knew you\r\nwould come, and I had something to tell you. It was such a miserable\r\nthing I--needed the accessories to help me out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't want to hear anything that distresses you to tell,\u201d I assured\r\nher. \u201cI didn't come here to force your confidence, Alison. I came\r\nbecause I couldn't help it.\u201d She did not object to my use of her name.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you found--your papers?\u201d she asked, looking directly at me for\r\nalmost the first time.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot yet. We hope to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe--police have not interfered with you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey haven't had any opportunity,\u201d I equivocated. \u201cYou needn't distress\r\nyourself about that, anyhow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I do. I wonder why you still believe in me? Nobody else does.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder,\u201d I repeated, \u201cwhy I do!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you produce Harry Sullivan,\u201d she was saying, partly to herself, \u201cand\r\nif you could connect him with Mr. Bronson, and get a full account of why\r\nhe was on the train, and all that, it--it would help, wouldn't it?\u201d\r\n\r\nI acknowledged that it would. Now that the whole truth was almost in\r\nmy possession, I was stricken with the old cowardice. I did not want to\r\nknow what she might tell me. The yellow line on the horizon, where the\r\nmoon was coming up, was a broken bit of golden chain: my heel in the\r\nsand was again pressed on a woman's yielding fingers: I pulled myself\r\ntogether with a jerk.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn order that what you might tell me may help me, if it will,\u201d I said\r\nconstrainedly, \u201cit would be necessary, perhaps, that you tell it to the\r\npolice. Since they have found the end of the necklace--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe end of the necklace!\u201d she repeated slowly. \u201cWhat about the end of\r\nthe necklace?\u201d\r\n\r\nI stared at her. \u201cDon't you remember\u201d--I leaned forward--\u201cthe end of the\r\ncameo necklace, the part that was broken off, and was found in the black\r\nsealskin bag, stained with--with blood?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBlood,\u201d she said dully. \u201cYou mean that you found the broken end? And\r\nthen--you had my gold pocket-book, and you saw the necklace in it, and\r\nyou--must have thought--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn't think anything,\u201d I hastened to assure her. \u201cI tell you,\r\nAlison, I never thought of anything but that you were unhappy, and that\r\nI had no right to help you. God knows, I thought you didn't want me to\r\nhelp you.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand to me and I took it between both of mine. No word\r\nof love had passed between us, but I felt that she knew and understood.\r\nIt was one of the moments that come seldom in a lifetime, and then only\r\nin great crises, a moment of perfect understanding and trust.\r\n\r\nThen she drew her hand away and sat, erect and determined, her fingers\r\nlaced in her lap. As she talked the moon came up slowly and threw its\r\nbright pathway across the water. Back of us, in the trees beyond the sea\r\nwall, a sleepy bird chirruped drowsily, and a wave, larger and bolder\r\nthan its brothers, sped up the sand, bringing the moon's silver to our\r\nvery feet. I bent toward the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am going to ask just one question.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnything you like.\u201d Her voice was almost dreary. \u201cWas it because of\r\nanything you are going to tell me that you refused Richey?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe drew her breath in sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, without looking at me. \u201cNo. That was not the reason.\u201d\r\n\nShe told her story evenly, with her eyes on the water, only now and\r\nthen, when I, too, sat looking seaward, I thought she glanced at me\r\nfurtively. And once, in the middle of it, she stopped altogether.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don't realize it, probably,\u201d she protested, \u201cbut you look like a--a\r\nwar god. Your face is horrible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will turn my back, if it will help any,\u201d I said stormily, \u201cbut if you\r\nexpect me to look anything but murderous, why, you don't know what I am\r\ngoing through with. That's all.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe story of her meeting with the Curtis woman was brief enough. They\r\nhad met in Rome first, where Alison and her mother had taken a villa for\r\na year. Mrs. Curtis had hovered on the ragged edges of society there,\r\npleading the poverty of the south since the war as a reason for not\r\ngoing out more. There was talk of a brother, but Alison had not seen\r\nhim, and after a scandal which implicated Mrs. Curtis and a young\r\nattache of the Austrian embassy, Alison had been forbidden to see the\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe women had never liked her, anyhow,\u201d she said. \u201cShe did\r\nunconventional things, and they are very conventional there. And they\r\nsaid she did not always pay her--her gambling debts. I didn't like\r\nthem. I thought they didn't like her because she was poor--and popular.\r\nThen--we came home, and I almost forgot her, but last spring, when\r\nmother was not well--she had taken grandfather to the Riviera, and it\r\nalways uses her up--we went to Virginia Hot Springs, and we met them\r\nthere, the brother, too, this time. His name was Sullivan, Harry\r\nPinckney Sullivan.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know. Go on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMother had a nurse, and I was alone a great deal, and they were very\r\nkind to me. I--I saw a lot of them. The brother rather attracted me,\r\npartly--partly because he did not make love to me. He even seemed to\r\navoid me, and I was piqued. I had been spoiled, I suppose. Most of the\r\nother men I knew had--had--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know that, too,\u201d I said bitterly, and moved away from her a trifle.\r\nI was brutal, but the whole story was a long torture. I think she knew\r\nwhat I was suffering, for she showed no resentment.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was early and there were few people around--none that I cared about.\r\nAnd mother and the nurse played cribbage eternally, until I felt as\r\nthough the little pegs were driven into my brain. And when Mrs. Curtis\r\narranged drives and picnics, I--I slipped away and went. I suppose you\r\nwon't believe me, but I had never done that kind of thing before, and\r\nI--well, I have paid up, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat sort of looking chap was Sullivan?\u201d I demanded. I had got up and\r\nwas pacing back and forward on the sand. I remember kicking savagely at\r\na bit of water-soaked board that lay in my way.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery handsome--as large as you are, but fair, and even more erect.\u201d\r\n\r\nI drew my shoulders up sharply. I am straight enough, but I was fairly\r\nsagging with jealous rage.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen mother began to get around, somebody told her that I had been\r\ngoing about with Mrs. Curtis and her brother, and we had a dreadful\r\ntime. I was dragged home like a bad child. Did anybody ever do that to\r\nyou?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNobody ever cared. I was born an orphan,\u201d I said, with a cheerless\r\nattempt at levity. \u201cGo on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf Mrs. Curtis knew, she never said anything. She wrote me charming\r\nletters, and in the summer, when they went to Cresson, she asked me to\r\nvisit her there. I was too proud to let her know that I could not go\r\nwhere I wished, and so--I sent Polly, my maid, to her aunt's in the\r\ncountry, pretended to go to Seal Harbor, and really went to Cresson. You\r\nsee I warned you it would be an unpleasant story.\u201d\r\n\r\nI went over and stood in front of her. All the accumulated jealousy of\r\nthe last few weeks had been fired by what she told me. If Sullivan had\r\ncome across the sands just then, I think I would have strangled him with\r\nmy hands, out of pure hate.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you marry him?\u201d I demanded. My voice sounded hoarse and strange in\r\nmy ears. \u201cThat's all I want to know. Did you marry him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\nI drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou--cared about him?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said finally. \u201cI did not care about him.\u201d\r\n\r\nI sat down on the edge of the boat and mopped my hot face. I was\r\nheartily ashamed of myself, and mingled with my abasement was a great\r\nrelief. If she had not married him, and had not cared for him, nothing\r\nelse was of any importance.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was sorry, of course, the moment the train had started, but I had\r\nwired I was coming, and I could not go back, and then when I got there,\r\nthe place was charming. There were no neighbors, but we fished and rode\r\nand motored, and--it was moonlight, like this.\u201d\r\n\r\nI put my hand over both of hers, clasped in her lap. \u201cI know,\u201d I\r\nacknowledged repentantly, \u201cand--people do queer things when it is\r\nmoonlight. The moon has got me to-night, Alison. If I am a boor,\r\nremember that, won't you?\u201d\r\n\r\nHer fingers lay quiet under mine. \u201cAnd so,\u201d she went on with a little\r\nsigh, \u201cI began to think perhaps I cared. But all the time I felt that\r\nthere was something not quite right. Now and then Mrs. Curtis would say\r\nor do something that gave me a queer start, as if she had dropped a mask\r\nfor a moment. And there was trouble with the servants; they were almost\r\ninsolent. I couldn't understand. I don't know when it dawned on me that\r\nthe old Baron Cavalcanti had been right when he said they were not my\r\nkind of people. But I wanted to get away, wanted it desperately.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course, they were not your kind,\u201d I cried. \u201cThe man was married! The\r\ngirl Jennie, a housemaid, was a spy in Mrs. Sullivan's employ. If he had\r\npretended to marry you I would have killed him! Not only that, but the\r\nman he murdered, Harrington, was his wife's father. And I'll see\r\nhim hang by the neck yet if it takes every energy and every penny I\r\npossess.\u201d\r\n\r\nI could have told her so much more gently, have broken the shock\r\nfor her; I have never been proud of that evening on the sand. I was\r\nalternately a boor and a ruffian--like a hurt youngster who passes the\r\nblow that has hurt him on to his playmate, that both may bawl together.\r\nAnd now Alison sat, white and cold, without speech.\r\n\r\n\u201cMarried!\u201d she said finally, in a small voice. \u201cWhy, I don't think it\r\nis possible, is it? I--I was on my way to Baltimore to marry him myself,\r\nwhen the wreck came.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you said you didn't care for him!\u201d I protested, my heavy masculine\r\nmind unable to jump the gaps in her story. And then, without the\r\nslightest warning, I realized that she was crying. She shook off my hand\r\nand fumbled for her handkerchief, and failing to find it, she accepted\r\nthe one I thrust into her wet fingers.\r\n\r\nThen, little by little, she told me from the handkerchief, a sordid\r\nstory of a motor trip in the mountains without Mrs. Curtis, of a lost\r\nroad and a broken car, and a rainy night when they--she and Sullivan,\r\ntramped eternally and did not get home. And of Mrs. Curtis, when they\r\ngot home at dawn, suddenly grown conventional and deeply shocked. Of\r\nher own proud, half-disdainful consent to make possible the hackneyed\r\ncompromising situation by marrying the rascal, and then--of his\r\ndisappearance from the train. It was so terrible to her, such a\r\nHeaven-sent relief to me, in spite of my rage against Sullivan, that I\r\nlaughed aloud. At which she looked at me over the handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know it's funny,\u201d she said, with a catch in her breath. \u201cWhen I think\r\nthat I nearly married a murderer--and didn't--I cry for sheer joy.\u201d Then\r\nshe buried her face and cried again.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease don't,\u201d I protested unsteadily. \u201cI won't be responsible if you\r\nkeep on crying like that. I may forget that I have a capital charge\r\nhanging over my head, and that I may be arrested at any moment.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat brought her out of the handkerchief at once. \u201cI meant to be so\r\nhelpful,\u201d she said, \u201cand I've thought of nothing but myself! There were\r\nsome things I meant to tell you. If Jennie was--what you say, then I\r\nunderstand why she came to me just before I left. She had been packing\r\nmy things and she must have seen what condition I was in, for she came\r\nover to me when I was getting my wraps on, to leave, and said, 'Don't do\r\nit, Miss West, I beg you won't do it; you'll be sorry ever after.' And\r\njust then Mrs. Curtis came in and Jennie slipped out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. As we went through the station the telegraph operator gave Har--Mr.\r\nSullivan a message. He read it on the platform, and it excited him\r\nterribly. He took his sister aside and they talked together. He was\r\nwhite with either fear or anger--I don't know which. Then, when we\r\nboarded the train, a woman in black, with beautiful hair, who was\r\nstanding on the car platform, touched him on the arm and then drew back.\r\nHe looked at her and glanced away again, but she reeled as if he had\r\nstruck her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen what?\u201d The situation was growing clearer.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Curtis and I had the drawing-room. I had a dreadful night, just\r\nsleeping a little now and then. I dreaded to see dawn come. It was to be\r\nmy wedding-day. When we found Harry had disappeared in the night, Mrs.\r\nCurtis was in a frenzy. Then--I saw his cigarette case in your hand. I\r\nhad given it to him. You wore his clothes. The murder was discovered and\r\nyou were accused of it! What could I do? And then, afterward, when I saw\r\nhim asleep at the farmhouse, I--I was panic-stricken. I locked him in\r\nand ran. I didn't know why he did it, but--he had killed a man.\u201d\r\n\r\nSome one was calling Alison through a megaphone, from the veranda. It\r\nsounded like Sam. \u201cAll-ee,\u201d he called. \u201cAll-ee! I'm going to have some\r\nanchovies on toast! All-ee!\u201d Neither of us heard.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder,\u201d I reflected, \u201cif you would be willing to repeat a part of\r\nthat story--just from the telegram on--to a couple of detectives, say\r\non Monday. If you would tell that, and--how the end of your necklace got\r\ninto the sealskin bag--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy necklace!\u201d she repeated. \u201cBut it isn't mine. I picked it up in the\r\ncar.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll-ee!\u201d Sam again. \u201cI see you down there. I'm making a julep!\u201d\r\n\r\nAlison turned and called through her hands. \u201cComing in a moment, Sam,\u201d\r\n she said, and rose. \u201cIt must be very late: Sam is home. We would better\r\ngo back to the house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon't,\u201d I begged her. \u201cAnchovies and juleps and Sam will go on for\r\never, and I have you such a little time. I suppose I am only one of a\r\ndozen or so, but--you are the only girl in the world. You know I love\r\nyou, don't you, dear?\u201d\r\n\r\nSam was whistling, an irritating bird call, over and over. She pursed\r\nher red lips and answered him in kind. It was more than I could endure.\r\n\r\n\u201cSam or no Sam,\u201d I said firmly, \u201cI am going to kiss you!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Sam's voice came strident through the megaphone. \u201cBe good, you two,\u201d\r\n he bellowed, \u201cI've got the binoculars!\u201d And so, under fire, we walked\r\nsedately back to the house. My pulses were throbbing--the little swish\r\nof her dress beside me on the grass was pain and ecstasy. I had but to\r\nput out my hand to touch her, and I dared not.\r\n\r\nSam, armed with a megaphone and field glasses, bent over the rail and\r\nwatched us with gleeful malignity.\r\n\r\n\u201cHome early, aren't you?\u201d Alison called, when we reached the steps.\r\n\r\n\u201cLed a club when my partner had doubled no-trumps, and she fainted.\r\nDamn the heart convention!\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cThe others are not here\r\nyet.\u201d\r\n\r\nThree hours later I went up to bed. I had not seen Alison alone again.\r\nThe noise was at its height below, and I glanced down into the garden,\r\nstill bright in the moonlight. Leaning against a tree, and staring\r\ninterestedly into the billiard room, was Johnson.\r\n\nThat was Saturday night, two weeks after the wreck. The previous five\r\ndays had been full of swift-following events--the woman in the house\r\nnext door, the picture in the theater of a man about to leap from the\r\ndoomed train, the dinner at the Dallases', and Richey's discovery that\r\nAlison was the girl in the case. In quick succession had come our visit\r\nto the Carter place, the finding of the rest of the telegram, my seeing\r\nAlison there, and the strange interview with Mrs. Conway. The Cresson\r\ntrip stood out in my memory for its serio-comic horrors and its one real\r\nthrill. Then--the discovery by the police of the seal-skin bag and the\r\nbit of chain; Hotchkiss producing triumphantly Stuart for Sullivan and\r\nhis subsequent discomfiture; McKnight at the station with Alison, and\r\nlater the confession that he was out of the running.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, when I thought it all over, the entire week and its events were\r\ntwo sides of a triangle that was narrowing rapidly to an apex, a point.\r\nAnd the said apex was at that moment in the drive below my window,\r\nresting his long legs by sitting on a carriage block, and smoking a pipe\r\nthat made the night hideous. The sense of the ridiculous is very close\r\nto the sense of tragedy. I opened my screen and whistled, and Johnson\r\nlooked up and grinned. We said nothing. I held up a handful of cigars,\r\nhe extended his hat, and when I finally went to sleep, it was to a\r\nsoothing breeze that wafted in salt air and a faint aroma of good\r\ntobacco. I was thoroughly tired, but I slept restlessly, dreaming of\r\ntwo detectives with Pittsburg warrants being held up by Hotchkiss at the\r\npoint of a splint, while Alison fastened their hands with a chain that\r\nwas broken and much too short. I was roused about dawn by a light rap at\r\nthe door, and, opening it, I found Forbes, in a pair of trousers and a\r\npajama coat. He was as pleasant as most fleshy people are when they have\r\nto get up at night, and he said the telephone had been ringing for an\r\nhour, and he didn't know why somebody else in the blankety-blank house\r\ncouldn't have heard it. He wouldn't get to sleep until noon.\r\n\r\nAs he was palpably asleep on his feet, I left him grumbling and went to\r\nthe telephone. It proved to be Richey, who had found me by the simple\r\nexpedient of tracing Alison, and he was jubilant.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou'll have to come back,\u201d he said. \u201cGot a railroad schedule there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't sleep with one in my pocket,\u201d I retorted, \u201cbut if you'll hold\r\nthe line I'll call out the window to Johnson. He's probably got one.\u201d'\r\n\r\n\u201cJohnson!\u201d I could hear the laugh with which McKnight comprehended the\r\nsituation. He was still chuckling when I came back.\r\n\r\n\u201cTrain to Richmond at six-thirty A.M.,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat time is it now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFour. Listen, Lollie. We've got him. Do you hear? Through the woman\r\nat Baltimore. Then the other woman, the lady of the restaurant\u201d--he was\r\nobviously avoiding names--\u201cshe is playing our cards for us. No--I don't\r\nknow why, and I don't care. But you be at the Incubator to-night at\r\neight o'clock. If you can't shake Johnson, bring him, bless him.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo this day I believe the Sam Forbeses have not recovered from the\r\nsurprise of my unexpected arrival, my one appearance at dinner in\r\nGranger's clothes, and the note on my dresser which informed them the\r\nnext morning that I had folded my tents like the Arabs and silently\r\nstole away. For at half after five Johnson and I, the former as\r\nuninquisitive as ever, were on our way through the dust to the station,\r\nthree miles away, and by four that afternoon we were in Washington. The\r\njourney had been uneventful. Johnson relaxed under the influence of my\r\ntobacco, and spoke at some length on the latest improvements in gallows,\r\ndilating on the absurdity of cutting out the former free passes to see\r\nthe affair in operation. I remember, too, that he mentioned the curious\r\nanomaly that permits a man about to be hanged to eat a hearty meal. I\r\ndid not enjoy my dinner that night.\r\n\r\nBefore we got into Washington I had made an arrangement with Johnson to\r\nsurrender myself at two the following afternoon. Also, I had wired to\r\nAlison, asking her if she would carry out the contract she had made. The\r\ndetective saw me home, and left me there. Mrs. Klopton received me with\r\ndignified reserve. The very tone in which she asked me when I would dine\r\ntold me that something was wrong.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow--what is it, Mrs. Klopton?\u201d I demanded finally, when she had\r\ninformed me, in a patient and long-suffering tone, that she felt worn\r\nout and thought she needed a rest.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I lived with Mr. Justice Springer,\u201d she began acidly, her\r\nmending-basket in her hands, \u201cit was an orderly, well-conducted\r\nhousehold. You can ask any of the neighbors. Meals were cooked and,\r\nwhat's more, they were eaten; there was none of this 'here one day and\r\ngone the next' business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d I observed. \u201cYou're tired, that's all, Mrs. Klopton. And I\r\nwish you would go out; I want to bathe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat's not all,\u201d she said with dignity, from the doorway. \u201cWomen coming\r\nand going here, women whose shoes I am not fit--I mean, women who are\r\nnot fit to touch my shoes--coming here as insolent as you please, and\r\nasking for you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cWhat did you tell them--her, whichever it\r\nwas?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTold her you were sick in a hospital and wouldn't be out for a year!\u201d\r\n she said triumphantly. \u201cAnd when she said she thought she'd come in and\r\nwait for you, I slammed the door on her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat time was she here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLate last night. And she had a light-haired man across the street. If\r\nshe thought I didn't see him, she don't know me.\u201d Then she closed the\r\ndoor and left me to my bath and my reflections.\r\n\r\nAt five minutes before eight I was at the Incubator, where I found\r\nHotchkiss and McKnight. They were bending over a table, on which lay\r\nMcKnight's total armament--a pair of pistols, an elephant gun and an old\r\ncavalry saber.\r\n\r\n\u201cDraw up a chair and help yourself to pie,\u201d he said, pointing to the\r\narsenal. \u201cThis is for the benefit of our friend Hotchkiss here, who says\r\nhe is a small man and fond of life.\u201d\r\n\r\nHotchkiss, who had been trying to get the wrong end of a cartridge into\r\nthe barrel of one of the revolvers, straightened himself and mopped his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have desperate people to handle,\u201d he said pompously, \u201cand we may\r\nneed desperate means.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHotchkiss is like the small boy whose one ambition was to have people\r\ngrow ashen and tremble at the mention of his name,\u201d McKnight jibed. But\r\nthey were serious enough, both of them, under it all, and when they had\r\ntold me what they planned, I was serious, too.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou're compounding a felony,\u201d I remonstrated, when they had explained.\r\n\u201cI'm not eager to be locked away, but, by Jove, to offer her the stolen\r\nnotes in exchange for Sullivan!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe haven't got either of them, you know,\u201d McKnight remonstrated, \u201cand\r\nwe won't have, if we don't start. Come along, Fido,\u201d to Hotchkiss.\r\n\r\nThe plan was simplicity itself. According to Hotchkiss, Sullivan was\r\nto meet Bronson at Mrs. Conway's apartment, at eight-thirty that night,\r\nwith the notes. He was to be paid there and the papers destroyed. \u201cBut\r\njust before that interesting finale,\u201d McKnight ended, \u201cwe will walk in,\r\ntake the notes, grab Sullivan, and give the police a jolt that will put\r\nthem out of the count.\u201d\r\n\r\nI suppose not one of us, slewing around corners in the machine that\r\nnight, had the faintest doubt that we were on the right track, or that\r\nFate, scurvy enough before, was playing into our hands at last. Little\r\nHotchkiss was in a state of fever; he alternately twitched and examined\r\nthe revolver, and a fear that the two movements might be synchronous\r\nkept me uneasy. He produced and dilated on the scrap of pillow slip from\r\nthe wreck, and showed me the stiletto, with its point in cotton batting\r\nfor safekeeping. And in the intervals he implored Richey not to make\r\nsuch fine calculations at the corners.\r\n\r\nWe were all grave enough and very quiet, however, when we reached the\r\nlarge building where Mrs. Conway had her apartment. McKnight left the\r\npower on, in case we might want to make a quick get-away, and Hotchkiss\r\ngave a final look at the revolver. I had no weapon. Somehow it all\r\nseemed melodramatic to the verge of farce. In the doorway Hotchkiss\r\nwas a half dozen feet ahead; Richey fell back beside me. He dropped his\r\naffectation of gayety, and I thought he looked tired. \u201cSame old Sam, I\r\nsuppose?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cSame, only more of him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose Alison was there? How is she?\u201d he inquired irrelevantly.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well. I did not see her this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\nHotchkiss was waiting near the elevator. McKnight put his hand on\r\nmy arm. \u201cNow, look here, old man,\u201d he said, \u201cI've got two arms and a\r\nrevolver, and you've got one arm and a splint. If Hotchkiss is right,\r\nand there is a row, you crawl under a table.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe deuce I will!\u201d I declared scornfully.\r\n\r\nWe crowded out of the elevator at the fourth floor, and found ourselves\r\nin a rather theatrical hallway of draperies and armor. It was very\r\nquiet; we stood uncertainly after the car had gone, and looked at the\r\ntwo or three doors in sight. They were heavy, covered with metal,\r\nand sound proof. From somewhere above came the metallic accuracy of a\r\nplayer-piano, and through the open window we could hear--or feel--the\r\nthrob of the Cannonball's engine.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Sherlock,\u201d McKnight said, \u201cwhat's the next move in the game? Is\r\nit our jump, or theirs? You brought us here.\u201d\r\n\r\nNone of us knew just what to do next. No sound of conversation\r\npenetrated the heavy doors. We waited uneasily for some minutes, and\r\nHotchkiss looked at his watch. Then he put it to his ear.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood gracious!\u201d he exclaimed, his head cocked on one side, \u201cI believe\r\nit has stopped. I'm afraid we are late.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe were late. My watch and Hotchkiss' agreed at nine o clock, and, with\r\nthe discovery that our man might have come and gone, our zest in the\r\nadventure began to flag. McKnight motioned us away from the door and\r\nrang the bell. There was no response, no sound within. He rang it twice,\r\nthe last time long and vigorously, without result. Then he turned and\r\nlooked at us.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't half like this,\u201d he said. \u201cThat woman is in; you heard me ask\r\nthe elevator boy. For two cents I'd--\u201d\r\n\r\nI had seen it when he did. The door was ajar about an inch, and a narrow\r\nwedge of rose-colored light showed beyond. I pushed the door a little\r\nand listened. Then, with both men at my heels, I stepped into the\r\nprivate corridor of the apartment and looked around. It was a square\r\nreception hall, with rugs on the floor, a tall mahogany rack for hats,\r\nand a couple of chairs. A lantern of rose-colored glass and a desk light\r\nover a writing-table across made the room bright and cheerful. It was\r\nempty.\r\n\r\nNone of us was comfortable. The place was full of feminine trifles\r\nthat made us feel the weakness of our position. Some such instinct made\r\nMcKnight suggest division.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe look like an invading army,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she's here alone, we will\r\nstartle her into a spasm. One of us could take a look around and--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat was that? Didn't you hear something?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe sound, whatever it had been, was not repeated. We went awkwardly out\r\ninto the hall, very uncomfortable, all of us, and flipped a coin. The\r\nchoice fell to me, which was right enough, for the affair was mine,\r\nprimarily.\r\n\r\n\u201cWait just inside the door,\u201d I directed, \u201cand if Sullivan comes, or\r\nanybody that answers his description, grab him without ceremony and ask\r\nhim questions afterwards.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe apartment, save in the hallway, was unlighted. By one of those\r\nfreaks of arrangement possible only in the modern flat, I found the\r\nkitchen first, and was struck a smart and unexpected blow by a swinging\r\ndoor. I carried a handful of matches, and by the time I had passed\r\nthrough a butler's pantry and a refrigerator room I was completely lost\r\nin the darkness. Until then the situation had been merely uncomfortable;\r\nsuddenly it became grisly. From somewhere near came a long-sustained\r\ngroan, followed almost instantly by the crash of something--glass or\r\nchina--on the floor.\r\n\r\nI struck a fresh match, and found myself in a narrow rear hallway.\r\nBehind me was the door by which I must have come; with a keen desire\r\nto get back to the place I had started from, I opened the door and\r\nattempted to cross the room. I thought I had kept my sense of direction,\r\nbut I crashed without warning into what, from the resulting jangle, was\r\nthe dining-table, probably laid for dinner. I cursed my stupidity in\r\ngetting into such a situation, and I cursed my nerves for making my hand\r\nshake when I tried to strike a match. The groan had not been repeated.\r\n\r\nI braced myself against the table and struck the match sharply against\r\nthe sole of my shoe. It flickered faintly and went out. And then,\r\nwithout the slightest warning, another dish went off the table. It fell\r\nwith a thousand splinterings; the very air seemed broken into crashing\r\nwaves of sound. I stood still, braced against the table, holding the red\r\nend of the dying match, and listened. I had not long to wait; the groan\r\ncame again, and I recognized it, the cry of a dog in straits. I breathed\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, old fellow,\u201d I said. \u201cCome on, old man. Let's have a look at\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\nI could hear the thud of his tail on the floor, but he did not move. He\r\nonly whimpered. There is something companionable in the presence of a\r\ndog, and I fancied this dog in trouble. Slowly I began to work my way\r\naround the table toward him.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood boy,\u201d I said, as he whimpered. \u201cWe'll find the light, which ought\r\nto be somewhere or other around here, and then--\u201d\r\n\r\nI stumbled over something, and I drew back my foot almost instantly.\r\n\u201cDid I step on you, old man?\u201d I exclaimed, and bent to pat him. I\r\nremember straightening suddenly and hearing the dog pad softly toward\r\nme around the table. I recall even that I had put the matches down and\r\ncould not find them. Then, with a bursting horror of the room and its\r\ncontents, of the gibbering dark around me, I turned and made for the\r\ndoor by which I had entered.\r\n\r\nI could not find it. I felt along the endless wainscoting, past miles of\r\nwall. The dog was beside me, I think, but he was part and parcel now, to\r\nmy excited mind, with the Thing under the table. And when, after aeons\r\nof search, I found a knob and stumbled into the reception hall, I was as\r\nnearly in a panic as any man could be.\r\n\r\nI was myself again in a second, and by the light from the hall I led\r\nthe way back to the tragedy I had stumbled on. Bronson still sat at the\r\ntable, his elbows propped on it, his cigarette still lighted, burning a\r\nhole in the cloth. Partly under the table lay Mrs. Conway face down. The\r\ndog stood over her and wagged his tail.\r\n\r\nMcKnight pointed silently to a large copper ashtray, filled with ashes\r\nand charred bits of paper.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe notes, probably,\u201d he said ruefully. \u201cHe got them after all, and\r\nburned them before her. It was more than she could stand. Stabbed him\r\nfirst and then herself.\u201d\r\n\r\nHotchkiss got up and took off his hat. \u201cThey are dead,\u201d he announced\r\nsolemnly, and took his note-book out of his hatband.\r\n\r\nMcKnight and I did the only thing we could think of--drove Hotchkiss and\r\nthe dog out of the room, and closed and locked the door. \u201cIt's a matter\r\nfor the police,\u201d McKnight asserted. \u201cI suppose you've got an officer\r\ntied to you somewhere, Lawrence? You usually have.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe left Hotchkiss in charge and went down-stairs. It was McKnight who\r\nfirst saw Johnson, leaning against a park railing across the street, and\r\ncalled him over. We told him in a few words what we had found, and he\r\ngrinned at me cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter while, in a few weeks or months, Mr. Blakeley,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen\r\nyou get tired of monkeying around with the blood-stain and finger-print\r\nspecialist up-stairs, you come to me. I've had that fellow you want\r\nunder surveillance for ten days!\u201d\r\n\nAt ten minutes before two the following day, Monday, I arrived at my\r\noffice. I had spent the morning putting my affairs in shape, and in a\r\ntrip to the stable. The afternoon would see me either a free man or a\r\nprisoner for an indefinite length of time, and, in spite of Johnson's\r\npromise to produce Sullivan, I was more prepared for the latter than the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nBlobs was watching for me outside the door, and it was clear that he was\r\nin a state of excitement bordering on delirium. He did nothing, however,\r\nsave to tip me a wink that meant \u201cAs man to man, I'm for you.\u201d I was too\r\nmuch engrossed either to reprove him or return the courtesy, but I heard\r\nhim follow me down the hall to the small room where we keep outgrown\r\nlawbooks, typewriter supplies and, incidentally, our wraps. I was\r\nwondering vaguely if I would ever hang my hat on its nail again, when\r\nthe door closed behind me. It shut firmly, without any particular amount\r\nof sound, and I was left in the dark. I groped my way to it, irritably,\r\nto find it locked on the outside. I shook it frantically, and was\r\nrewarded by a sibilant whisper through the keyhole.\r\n\r\n\u201cKeep quiet,\u201d Blobs was saying huskily. \u201cYou're in deadly peril. The\r\npolice are waiting in your office, three of 'em. I'm goin' to lock the\r\nwhole bunch in and throw the key out of the window.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome back here, you imp of Satan!\u201d I called furiously, but I could hear\r\nhim speeding down the corridor, and the slam of the outer office door\r\nby which he always announced his presence. And so I stood there in that\r\nridiculous cupboard, hot with the heat of a steaming September day,\r\nmusty with the smell of old leather bindings, littered with broken\r\novershoes and handleless umbrellas. I was apoplectic with rage one\r\nminute, and choked with laughter the next. It seemed an hour before\r\nBlobs came back.\r\n\r\nHe came without haste, strutting with new dignity, and paused outside my\r\nprison door.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I guess that will hold them for a while,\u201d he remarked\r\ncomfortably, and proceeded to turn the key. \u201cI've got 'em fastened up\r\nlike sardines in a can!\u201d he explained, working with the lock. \u201cGee whiz!\r\nyou'd ought to hear 'em!\u201d When he got his breath after the shaking I\r\ngave him, he began to splutter. \u201cHow'd I know?\u201d he demanded sulkily.\r\n\u201cYou nearly broke your neck gettin' away the other time. And I haven't\r\ngot the old key. It's lost.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere's it lost?\u201d I demanded, with another gesture toward his coat\r\ncollar.\r\n\r\n\u201cDown the elevator shaft.\u201d There was a gleam of indignant satisfaction\r\nthrough his tears of rage and humiliation.\r\n\r\nAnd so, while he hunted the key in the debris at the bottom of the\r\nshaft, I quieted his prisoners with the assurance that the lock had\r\nslipped, and that they would be free as lords as soon as we could find\r\nthe janitor with a pass-key. Stuart went down finally and discovered\r\nBlobs, with the key in his pocket, telling the engineer how he had tried\r\nto save me from arrest and failed. When Stuart came up he was almost\r\ncheerful, but Blobs did not appear again that day.\r\n\r\nSimultaneous with the finding of the key came Hotchkiss, and we went\r\nin together. I shook hands with two men who, with Hotchkiss, made a\r\nnot very animated group. The taller one, an oldish man, lean and hard,\r\nannounced his errand at once.\r\n\r\n\u201cA Pittsburg warrant?\u201d I inquired, unlocking my cigar drawer.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Allegheny County has assumed jurisdiction, the exact locality\r\nwhere the crime was committed being in doubt.\u201d He seemed to be the\r\nspokesman. The other, shorter and rotund, kept an amiable silence. \u201cWe\r\nhope you will see the wisdom of waiving extradition,\u201d he went on. \u201cIt\r\nwill save time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI'll come, of course,\u201d I agreed. \u201cThe sooner the better. But I want you\r\nto give me an hour here, gentlemen. I think we can interest you. Have a\r\ncigar?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe lean man took a cigar; the rotund man took three, putting two in his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow about the catch of that door?\u201d he inquired jovially. \u201cAny danger\r\nof it going off again?\u201d Really, considering the circumstances, they were\r\nremarkably cheerful. Hotchkiss, however, was not. He paced the floor\r\nuneasily, his hands under his coat-tails. The arrival of McKnight\r\ncreated a diversion; he carried a long package and a corkscrew, and\r\nshook hands with the police and opened the bottle with a single gesture.\r\n\r\n\u201cI always want something to cheer on these occasions,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere's\r\nthe water, Blakeley? Everybody ready?\u201d Then in French he toasted the two\r\ndetectives.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo your eternal discomfiture,\u201d he said, bowing ceremoniously. \u201cMay you\r\ngo home and never come back! If you take Monsieur Blakeley with you, I\r\nhope you choke.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe lean man nodded gravely. \u201cProsit,\u201d he said. But the fat one leaned\r\nback and laughed consumedly.\r\n\r\nHotchkiss finished a mental synopsis of his position, and put down his\r\nglass. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d he said pompously, \u201cwithin five minutes the man you\r\nwant will be here, a murderer caught in a net of evidence so fine that a\r\nmosquito could not get through.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe detectives glanced at each other solemnly. Had they not in their\r\npossession a sealskin bag containing a wallet and a bit of gold chain,\r\nwhich, by putting the crime on me, would leave a gap big enough for\r\nSullivan himself to crawl through?\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy don't you say your little speech before Johnson brings the other\r\nman, Lawrence?\u201d McKnight inquired. \u201cThey won't believe you, but it will\r\nhelp them to understand what is coming.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou understand, of course,\u201d the lean man put in gravely, \u201cthat what you\r\nsay may be used against you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI'll take the risk,\u201d I answered impatiently.\r\n\r\nIt took some time to tell the story of my worse than useless trip to\r\nPittsburg, and its sequel. They listened gravely, without interruption.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Hotchkiss here,\u201d I finished, \u201cbelieves that the man Sullivan,\r\nwhom we are momentarily expecting, committed the crime. Mr. McKnight is\r\ninclined to implicate Mrs. Conway, who stabbed Bronson and then herself\r\nlast night. As for myself, I am open to conviction.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope not,\u201d said the stout detective quizzically. And then Alison\r\nwas announced. My impulse to go out and meet her was forestalled by the\r\ndetectives, who rose when I did. McKnight, therefore, brought her in,\r\nand I met her at the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have put you to a great deal of trouble,\u201d I said contritely, when I\r\nsaw her glance around the room. \u201cI wish I had not--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is only right that I should come,\u201d she replied, looking up at me.\r\n\u201cI am the unconscious cause of most of it, I am afraid. Mrs. Dallas is\r\ngoing to wait in the outer office.\u201d\r\n\r\nI presented Hotchkiss and the two detectives, who eyed her with\r\ninterest. In her poise, her beauty, even in her gown, I fancy she\r\nrepresented a new type to them. They remained standing until she sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have brought the necklace,\u201d she began, holding out a white-wrapped\r\nbox, \u201cas you asked me to.\u201d\r\n\r\nI passed it, unopened, to the detectives. \u201cThe necklace from which was\r\nbroken the fragment you found in the sealskin bag,\u201d I explained. \u201cMiss\r\nWest found it on the floor of the car, near lower ten.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did you find it?\u201d asked the lean detective, bending forward.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the morning, not long before the wreck.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you ever see it before?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am not certain,\u201d she replied. \u201cI have seen one very much like it.\u201d\r\n Her tone was troubled. She glanced at me as if for help, but I was\r\npowerless.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d The detective was watching her closely. At that moment there\r\ncame an interruption. The door opened without ceremony, and Johnson\r\nushered in a tall, blond man, a stranger to all of us: I glanced at\r\nAlison; she was pale, but composed and scornful. She met the new-comer's\r\neyes full, and, caught unawares, he took a hasty backward step.\r\n\r\n\u201cSit down, Mr. Sullivan,\u201d McKnight beamed cordially. \u201cHave a cigar? I\r\nbeg your pardon, Alison, do you mind this smoke?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d she said composedly. Sullivan had had a second to sound\r\nhis bearings.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo--no, thanks,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cIf you will be good enough to explain--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut that's what you're to do,\u201d McKnight said cheerfully, pulling up a\r\nchair. \u201cYou've got the most attentive audience you could ask. These two\r\ngentlemen are detectives from Pittsburg, and we are all curious to know\r\nthe finer details of what happened on the car Ontario two weeks ago, the\r\nnight your father-in-law was murdered.\u201d Sullivan gripped the arms of his\r\nchair. \u201cWe are not prejudiced, either. The gentlemen from Pittsburg are\r\nbetting on Mr. Blakeley, over there. Mr. Hotchkiss, the gentleman by the\r\nradiator, is ready to place ten to one odds on you. And some of us have\r\nstill other theories.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Sullivan said slowly, \u201cI give you my word of honor that I\r\ndid not kill Simon Harrington, and that I do not know who did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFiddlededee!\u201d cried Hotchkiss, bustling forward. \u201cWhy, I can tell\r\nyou--\u201d But McKnight pushed him firmly into a chair and held him there.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am ready to plead guilty to the larceny,\u201d Sullivan went on. \u201cI took\r\nMr. Blakeley's clothes, I admit. If I can reimburse him in any way for\r\nthe inconvenience-\u201d\r\n\r\nThe stout detective was listening with his mouth open. \u201cDo you mean\r\nto say,\u201d he demanded, \u201cthat you got into Mr. Blakeley's berth, as he\r\ncontends, took his clothes and forged notes, and left the train before\r\nthe wreck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe notes, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI gave them to Bronson yesterday. Much good they did him!\u201d bitterly.\r\nWe were all silent for a moment. The two detectives were adjusting\r\nthemselves with difficulty to a new point of view; Sullivan was looking\r\ndejectedly at the floor, his hands hanging loose between his knees.\r\nI was watching Alison; from where I stood, behind her, I could almost\r\ntouch the soft hair behind her ear.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no intention of pressing any charge against you,\u201d I said with\r\nforced civility, for my hands were itching to get at him, \u201cif you will\r\ngive us a clear account of what happened on the Ontario that night.\u201d\r\n\r\nSullivan raised his handsome, haggard head and looked around at me.\r\n\u201cI've seen you before, haven't I?\u201d he asked. \u201cWeren't you an uninvited\r\nguest at the Laurels a few days--or nights--ago? The cat, you remember,\r\nand the rug that slipped?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI remember,\u201d I said shortly. He glanced from me to Alison and quickly\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe truth can't hurt me,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it's devilish unpleasant.\r\nAlison, you know all this. You would better go out.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis use of her name crazed me. I stepped in front of her and stood over\r\nhim. \u201cYou will not bring Miss West into the conversation,\u201d I threatened,\r\n\u201cand she will stay if she wishes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, very well,\u201d he said with assumed indifference. Hotchkiss just then\r\nescaped from Richey's grasp and crossed the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you ever wear glasses?\u201d he asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever.\u201d Sullivan glanced with some contempt at mine.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'd better begin by going back a little,\u201d he went on sullenly. \u201cI\r\nsuppose you know I was married to Ida Harrington about five years ago.\r\nShe was a good girl, and I thought a lot of her. But her father opposed\r\nthe marriage--he'd never liked me, and he refused to make any sort of\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had thought, of course, that there would be money, and it was a\r\nbad day when I found out I'd made a mistake. My sister was wild with\r\ndisappointment. We were pretty hard up, my sister and I.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was watching Alison. Her hands were tightly clasped in her lap, and\r\nshe was staring out of the window at the cheerless roof below. She had\r\nset her lips a little, but that was all.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou understand, of course, that I'm not defending myself,\u201d went on the\r\nsullen voice. \u201cThe day came when old Harrington put us both out of the\r\nhouse at the point of a revolver, and I threatened--I suppose you know\r\nthat, too--I threatened to kill him.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy sister and I had hard times after that. We lived on the continent\r\nfor a while. I was at Monte Carlo and she was in Italy. She met a young\r\nlady there, the granddaughter of a steel manufacturer and an heiress,\r\nand she sent for me. When I got to Rome the girl was gone. Last winter I\r\nwas all in--social secretary to an Englishman, a wholesale grocer with\r\na new title, but we had a row, and I came home. I went out to the Heaton\r\nboys' ranch in Wyoming, and met Bronson there. He lent me money, and\r\nI've been doing his dirty work ever since.\u201d\r\n\r\nSullivan got up then and walked slowly forward and back as he talked,\r\nhis eyes on the faded pattern of the office rug.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you want to live in hell,\u201d he said savagely, \u201cput yourself in\r\nanother man's power. Bronson got into trouble, forging John Gilmore's\r\nname to those notes, and in some way he learned that a man was bringing\r\nthe papers back to Washington on the Flier. He even learned the number\r\nof his berth, and the night before the wreck, just as I was boarding the\r\ntrain, I got a telegram.\u201d\r\n\r\nHotchkiss stepped forward once more importantly. \u201cWhich read, I think:\r\n'Man with papers in lower ten, car seven. Get them.'\u201d\r\n\r\nSullivan looked at the little man with sulky blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was something like that, anyhow. But it was a nasty business, and it\r\nmade matters worse that he didn't care that a telegram which must pass\r\nthrough a half dozen hands was more or less incriminating to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, to add to the unpleasantness of my position, just after we\r\nboarded the train--I was accompanying my sister and this young lady,\r\nMiss West--a woman touched me on the sleeve, and I turned to face--my\r\nwife!\r\n\r\n\u201cThat took away my last bit of nerve. I told my sister, and you can\r\nunderstand she was in a bad way, too. We knew what it meant. Ida had\r\nheard that I was going--\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stopped and glanced uneasily at Alison.\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cIt is too late to shield me. The time to have\r\ndone that was when I was your guest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he went on, his eyes turned carefully away from my face, which\r\nmust have presented certainly anything but a pleasant sight. \u201cMiss West\r\nwas going to do me the honor to marry me, and--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou scoundrel!\u201d I burst forth, thrusting past Alison West's chair.\r\n\u201cYou--you infernal cur!\u201d\r\n\r\nOne of the detectives got up and stood between us. \u201cYou must remember,\r\nMr. Blakeley, that you are forcing this story from this man. These\r\ndetails are unpleasant, but important. You were going to marry this\r\nyoung lady,\u201d he said, turning to Sullivan, \u201calthough you already had a\r\nwife living?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was my sister's plan, and I was in a bad way for money. If I could\r\nmarry, secretly, a wealthy girl and go to Europe, it was unlikely that\r\nIda--that is, Mrs. Sullivan--would hear of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo it was more than a shock to see my wife on the train, and to realize\r\nfrom her face that she knew what was going on. I don't know yet, unless\r\nsome of the servants--well, never mind that.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt meant that the whole thing had gone up. Old Harrington had carried\r\na gun for me for years, and the same train wouldn't hold both of us. Of\r\ncourse, I thought that he was in the coach just behind ours.\u201d\r\n\r\nHotchkiss was leaning forward now, his eyes narrowed, his thin lips\r\ndrawn to a line.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you left-handed, Mr. Sullivan?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\nSullivan stopped in surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cCan't do anything with my left hand.\u201d Hotchkiss\r\nsubsided, crestfallen but alert. \u201cI tore up that cursed telegram, but I\r\nwas afraid to throw the scraps away. Then I looked around for lower ten.\r\nIt was almost exactly across--my berth was lower seven, and it was, of\r\ncourse, a bit of exceptional luck for me that the car was number seven.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you tell your sister of the telegram from Bronson?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. It would do no good, and she was in a bad way without that to make\r\nher worse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour sister was killed, think.\u201d The shorter detective took a small\r\npackage from his pocket and held it in his hand, snapping the rubber\r\nband which held it.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, she was killed,\u201d Sullivan said soberly. \u201cWhat I say now can do her\r\nno harm.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stopped to push back the heavy hair which dropped over his forehead,\r\nand went on more connectedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was late, after midnight, and we went at once to our berths. I\r\nundressed, and then I lay there for an hour, wondering how I was going\r\nto get the notes. Some one in lower nine was restless and wide awake,\r\nbut finally became quiet.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe man in ten was sleeping heavily. I could hear his breathing, and it\r\nseemed to be only a question of getting across and behind the curtains\r\nof his berth without being seen. After that, it was a mere matter of\r\nquiet searching.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe car became very still. I was about to try for the other berth, when\r\nsome one brushed softly past, and I lay back again.\r\n\r\n\u201cFinally, however, when things had been quiet for a time, I got up, and\r\nafter looking along the aisle, I slipped behind the curtains of lower\r\nten. You understand, Mr. Blakeley, that I thought you were in lower ten,\r\nwith the notes.\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded curtly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm not trying to defend myself,\u201d he went on. \u201cI was ready to steal the\r\nnotes--I had to. But murder!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe wiped his forehead with his handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I slipped across and behind the curtains. It was very still. The\r\nman in ten didn't move, although my heart was thumping until I thought\r\nhe would hear it.\r\n\r\n\u201cI felt around cautiously. It was perfectly dark, and I came across a\r\nbit of chain, about as long as my finger. It seemed a queer thing to\r\nfind there, and it was sticky, too.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe shuddered, and I could see Alison's hands clenching and unclenching\r\nwith the strain.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll at once it struck me that the man was strangely silent, and I think\r\nI lost my nerve. Anyhow, I drew the curtains open a little, and let the\r\nlight fall on my hands. They were red, blood-red.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe leaned one hand on the back of the chair, and was silent for a\r\nmoment, as though he lived over again the awful events of that more than\r\nawful night.\r\n\r\nThe stout detective had let his cigar go out; he was still drawing at it\r\nnervously. Richey had picked up a paper-weight and was tossing it from\r\nhand to hand; when it slipped and fell to the floor, a startled shudder\r\npassed through the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was something glittering in there,\u201d Sullivan resumed, \u201cand on\r\nimpulse I picked it up. Then I dropped the curtains and stumbled back to\r\nmy own berth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere you wiped your hands on the bed-clothing and stuck the dirk\r\ninto the pillow.\u201d Hotchkiss was seeing his carefully built structure\r\ncrumbling to pieces, and he looked chagrined.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose I did--I'm not very clear about what happened then. But when\r\nI rallied a little I saw a Russia leather wallet lying in the aisle\r\nalmost at my feet, and, like a fool, I stuck it, with the bit of chain,\r\ninto my bag.\r\n\r\n\u201cI sat there, shivering, for what seemed hours. It was still perfectly\r\nquiet, except for some one snoring. I thought that would drive me crazy.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe more I thought of it the worse things looked. The telegram was the\r\nfirst thing against me--it would put the police on my track at once,\r\nwhen it was discovered that the man in lower ten had been killed.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I remembered the notes, and I took out the wallet and opened it.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stopped for a minute, as if the recalling of the next occurrence was\r\nalmost beyond him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI took out the wallet,\u201d he said simply, \u201cand opening it, held it to the\r\nlight. In gilt letters was the name, Simon Harrington.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe detectives were leaning forward now, their eyes on his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cThings seemed to whirl around for a while. I sat there almost\r\nparalyzed, wondering what this new development meant for me.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy wife, I knew, would swear I had killed her father; nobody would be\r\nlikely to believe the truth.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you believe me now?\u201d He rooked around at us defiantly. \u201cI am telling\r\nthe absolute truth, and not one of you believes me!\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter a bit the man in lower nine got up and walked along the aisle\r\ntoward the smoking compartment. I heard him go, and, leaning from my\r\nberth, watched him out of sight.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was then I got the idea of changing berths with him, getting into\r\nhis clothes, and leaving the train. I give you my word I had no idea of\r\nthrowing suspicion on him.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlison looked scornfully incredulous, but I felt that the man was\r\ntelling the truth.\r\n\r\n\u201cI changed the numbers of the berths, and it worked well. I got into\r\nthe other man's berth, and he came back to mine. The rest was easy. I\r\ndressed in his clothes--luckily, they fitted--and jumped the train not\r\nfar from Baltimore, just before the wreck.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is something else you must clear up,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy did you try\r\nto telephone me from M-, and why did you change your mind about the\r\nmessage?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked astounded.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou knew I was at M-?\u201d he stammered.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, we traced you. What about the message?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it was this way: of course, I did not know your name, Mr.\r\nBlakeley. The telegram said, 'Man with papers in lower ten, car seven,\u201d\r\n and after I had made what I considered my escape, I began to think I had\r\nleft the man in my berth in a bad way.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe would probably be accused of the crime. So, although when the wreck\r\noccurred I supposed every one connected with the affair had been killed,\r\nthere was a chance that you had survived. I've not been of much account,\r\nbut I didn't want a man to swing because I'd left him in my place.\r\nBesides, I began to have a theory of my own.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs we entered the car a tall, dark woman passed us, with a glass of\r\nwater in her hand, and I vaguely remembered her. She was amazingly like\r\nBlanche Conway.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf she, too, thought the man with the notes was in lower ten, it\r\nexplained a lot, including that piece of a woman's necklace. She was a\r\nfury, Blanche Conway, capable of anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen why did you countermand that message?\u201d I asked curiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I got to the Carter house, and got to bed--I had sprained my ankle\r\nin the jump--I went through the alligator bag I had taken from lower\r\nnine. When I found your name, I sent the first message. Then, soon\r\nafter, I came across the notes. It seemed too good to be true, and I was\r\ncrazy for fear the message had gone.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt first I was going to send them to Bronson; then I began to see what\r\nthe possession of the notes meant to me. It meant power over Bronson,\r\nmoney, influence, everything. He was a devil, that man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, he's at home now,\u201d said McKnight, and we were glad to laugh and\r\nrelieve the tension.\r\n\r\nAlison put her hand over her eyes, as if to shut out the sight of the\r\nman she had so nearly married, and I furtively touched one of the soft\r\nlittle curls that nestled at the back of her neck.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I was able to walk,\u201d went on the sullen voice, \u201cI came at once to\r\nWashington. I tried to sell the notes to Bronson, but he was almost at\r\nthe end of his rope. Not even my threat to send them back to you, Mr.\r\nBlakeley, could make him meet my figure. He didn't have the money.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcKnight was triumphant.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think you gentlemen will see reason in my theory now,\u201d he said. \u201cMrs.\r\nConway wanted the notes to force a legal marriage, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe detective with the small package carefully rolled off the rubber\r\nband, and unwrapped it. I held my breath as he took out, first, the\r\nRussia leather wallet.\r\n\r\n\u201cThese things, Mr. Blakeley, we found in the seal-skin bag Mr. Sullivan\r\nsays he left you. This wallet, Mr. Sullivan--is this the one you found\r\non the floor of the car?\u201d\r\n\r\nSullivan opened it, and, glancing at the name inside, \u201cSimon\r\nHarrington,\u201d nodded affirmatively.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd this,\u201d went on the detective--\u201cthis is a piece of gold chain?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to be,\u201d said Sullivan, recoiling at the blood-stained end.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis, I believe, is the dagger.\u201d He held it up, and Alison gave a faint\r\ncry of astonishment and dismay. Sullivan's face grew ghastly, and he sat\r\ndown weakly on the nearest chair.\r\n\r\nThe detective looked at him shrewdly, then at Alison's agitated face.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere have you seen this dagger before, young lady?\u201d he asked, kindly\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, don't ask me!\u201d she gasped breathlessly, her eyes turned on\r\nSullivan. \u201cIt's--it's too terrible!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTell him,\u201d I advised, leaning over to her. \u201cIt will be found out later,\r\nanyhow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAsk him,\u201d she said, nodding toward Sullivan. The detective unwrapped\r\nthe small box Alison had brought, disclosing the trampled necklace and\r\nbroken chain. With clumsy fingers he spread it on the table and fitted\r\ninto place the bit of chain. There could be no doubt that it belonged\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere did you find that chain?\u201d Sullivan asked hoarsely, looking for\r\nthe first time at Alison.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the floor, near the murdered man's berth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Mr. Sullivan,\u201d said the detective civilly, \u201cI believe you can\r\ntell us, in the light of these two exhibits, who really did murder Simon\r\nHarrington.\u201d\r\n\r\nSullivan looked again at the dagger, a sharp little bit of steel with\r\na Florentine handle. Then he picked up the locket and pressed a hidden\r\nspring under one of the cameos. Inside, very neatly engraved, was the\r\nname and a date.\r\n\r\n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d he said, his face ghastly, \u201cit is of no use for me to\r\nattempt a denial. The dagger and necklace belonged to my sister, Alice\r\nCurtis!\u201d\r\n\nHotchkiss was the first to break the tension.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Sullivan,\u201d he asked suddenly, \u201cwas your sister left-handed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\nHotchkiss put away his note-book and looked around with an air of\r\ntriumphant vindication. It gave us a chance to smile and look relieved.\r\nAfter all, Mrs. Curtis was dead. It was the happiest solution of the\r\nunhappy affair. McKnight brought Sullivan some whisky, and he braced up\r\na little.\r\n\r\n\u201cI learned through the papers that my wife was in a Baltimore hospital,\r\nand yesterday I ventured there to see her. I felt if she would help me\r\nto keep straight, that now, with her father and my sister both dead, we\r\nmight be happy together.\r\n\r\n\u201cI understand now what puzzled me then. It seemed that my sister went\r\ninto the next car and tried to make my wife promise not to interfere.\r\nBut Ida--Mrs. Sullivan--was firm, of course. She said her father had\r\npapers, certificates and so on, that would stop the marriage at once.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe said, also, that her father was in our car, and that there would be\r\nthe mischief to pay in the morning. It was probably when my sister tried\r\nto get the papers that he awakened, and she had to do--what she did.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was over. Save for a technicality or two, I was a free man. Alison\r\nrose quietly and prepared to go; the men stood to let her pass, save\r\nSullivan who sat crouched in his chair, his face buried in his hands.\r\nHotchkiss, who had been tapping the desk with his pencil, looked up\r\nabruptly and pointed the pencil at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf all this is true, and I believe it is,--then who was in the house\r\nnext door, Blakeley, the night you and Mr. Johnson searched? You\r\nremember, you said it was a woman's hand at the trap door.\u201d\r\n\r\nI glanced hastily at Johnson, whose face was impassive. He had his hand\r\non the knob of the door and he opened it before he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere were a number of scratches on Mrs. Conway's right hand,\u201d he\r\nobserved to the room in general. \u201cHer wrist was bandaged and badly\r\nbruised.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe went out then, but he turned as he closed the door and threw at me a\r\nglance of half-amused, half-contemptuous tolerance.\r\n\r\nMcKnight saw Alison, with Mrs. Dallas, to their carriage, and came back\r\nagain. The gathering in the office was breaking up. Sullivan, looking\r\nworn and old, was standing by the window, staring at the broken necklace\r\nin his hand. When he saw me watching him, he put it on the desk and\r\npicked up his hat.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I can not do anything more--\u201d he hesitated.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think you have done about enough,\u201d I replied grimly, and he went out.\r\n\r\nI believe that Richey and Hotchkiss led me somewhere to dinner, and\r\nthat, for fear I would be lonely without him, they sent for Johnson.\r\nAnd I recall a spirited discussion in which Hotchkiss told the detective\r\nthat he could manage certain cases, but that he lacked induction. Richey\r\nand I were mainly silent. My thoughts would slip ahead to that hour,\r\nlater in the evening, when I should see Alison again.\r\n\r\nI dressed in savage haste finally, and was so particular about my tie\r\nthat Mrs. Klopton gave up in despair.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish, until your arm is better, that you would buy the kind that\r\nhooks on,\u201d she protested, almost tearfully. \u201cI'm sure they look very\r\nnice, Mr. Lawrence. My late husband always--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat's a lover's knot you've tied this time,\u201d I snarled, and, jerking\r\nopen the bow knot she had so painfully executed, looked out the\r\nwindow for Johnson--until I recalled that he no longer belonged in my\r\nperspective. I ended by driving frantically to the club and getting\r\nGeorge to do it.\r\n\r\nI was late, of course. The drawing-room and library at the Dallas home\r\nwere empty. I could hear billiard balls rolling somewhere, and I turned\r\nthe other way. I found Alison at last on the balcony, sitting much as\r\nshe had that night on the beach,--her chin in her hands, her eyes fixed\r\nunseeingly on the trees and lights of the square across. She was even\r\nwhistling a little, softly. But this time the plaintiveness was gone.\r\nIt was a tender little tune. She did not move, as I stood beside her,\r\nlooking down. And now, when the moment had come, all the thousand and\r\none things I had been waiting to say forsook me, precipitately beat\r\na retreat, and left me unsupported. The arc-moon sent little fugitive\r\nlights over her hair, her eyes, her gown.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon't--do that,\u201d I said unsteadily. \u201cYou--you know what I want to do\r\nwhen you whistle!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe glanced up at me, and she did not stop. She did not stop! She went\r\non whistling softly, a bit tremulously. And straightway I forgot the\r\nstreet, the chance of passers-by, the voices in the house behind us.\r\n\u201cThe world doesn't hold any one but you,\u201d I said reverently. \u201cIt is our\r\nworld, sweetheart. I love you.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd I kissed her.\r\n\r\nA boy was whistling on the pavement below. I let her go reluctantly and\r\nsat back where I could see her.\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven't done this the way I intended to at all,\u201d I confessed. \u201cIn\r\nbooks they get things all settled, and then kiss the lady.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSettled?\u201d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, about getting married and that sort of thing,\u201d I explained with\r\nelaborate carelessness. \u201cWe--we could go down to Bermuda--or--or\r\nJamaica, say in December.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe drew her hand away and faced me squarely.\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe you are afraid!\u201d she declared. \u201cI refuse to marry you unless\r\nyou propose properly. Everybody does it. And it is a woman's privilege:\r\nshe wants to have that to look back to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d I consented with an exaggerated sigh. \u201cIf you will promise\r\nnot to think I look like an idiot, I shall do it, knee and all.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had to pass her to close the door behind us, but when I kissed her\r\nagain she protested that we were not really engaged.\r\n\r\nI turned to look down at her. \u201cIt is a terrible thing,\u201d I said\r\nexultantly, \u201cto love a girl the way I love you, and to have only one\r\narm!\u201d Then I closed the door.\r\n\r\nFrom across the street there came a sharp crescendo whistle, and a\r\nvaguely familiar figure separated itself from the park railing.\r\n\r\n\u201cSay,\u201d he called, in a hoarse whisper, \u201cshall I throw the key down the\r\nelevator shaft?\u201d\r\n\n"}
