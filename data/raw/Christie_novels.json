{"The Mysterious Affair at Styles": "The intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the\r\ntime as \u201cThe Styles Case\u201d has now somewhat subsided. Nevertheless, in\r\nview of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked,\r\nboth by my friend Poirot and the family themselves, to write an account\r\nof the whole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the\r\nsensational rumours which still persist.\r\n\r\nI will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my\r\nbeing connected with the affair.\r\n\r\nI had been invalided home from the Front; and, after spending some\r\nmonths in a rather depressing Convalescent Home, was given a month\u2019s\r\nsick leave. Having no near relations or friends, I was trying to make\r\nup my mind what to do, when I ran across John Cavendish. I had seen\r\nvery little of him for some years. Indeed, I had never known him\r\nparticularly well. He was a good fifteen years my senior, for one\r\nthing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. As a boy, though,\r\nI had often stayed at Styles, his mother\u2019s place in Essex.\r\n\r\nWe had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me\r\ndown to Styles to spend my leave there.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe mater will be delighted to see you again\u2014after all those years,\u201d\r\nhe added.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour mother keeps well?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes. I suppose you know that she has married again?\u201d\r\n\r\nI am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly. Mrs. Cavendish, who\r\nhad married John\u2019s father when he was a widower with two sons, had been\r\na handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her. She certainly could\r\nnot be a day less than seventy now. I recalled her as an energetic,\r\nautocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social\r\nnotoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady\r\nBountiful. She was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable\r\nfortune of her own.\r\n\r\nTheir country-place, Styles Court, had been purchased by Mr. Cavendish\r\nearly in their married life. He had been completely under his wife\u2019s\r\nascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her\r\nlifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that\r\nwas distinctly unfair to his two sons. Their step-mother, however, had\r\nalways been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the\r\ntime of their father\u2019s remarriage that they always thought of her as\r\ntheir own mother.\r\n\r\nLawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. He had qualified as a\r\ndoctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at\r\nhome while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any\r\nmarked success.\r\n\r\nJohn practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled\r\ndown to the more congenial life of a country squire. He had married two\r\nyears ago, and had taken his wife to live at Styles, though I\r\nentertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother\r\nto increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home\r\nof his own. Mrs. Cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her\r\nown plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this\r\ncase she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.\r\n\r\nJohn noticed my surprise at the news of his mother\u2019s remarriage and\r\nsmiled rather ruefully.\r\n\r\n\u201cRotten little bounder too!\u201d he said savagely. \u201cI can tell you,\r\nHastings, it\u2019s making life jolly difficult for us. As for Evie\u2014you\r\nremember Evie?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I suppose she was after your time. She\u2019s the mater\u2019s factotum,\r\ncompanion, Jack of all trades! A great sport\u2014old Evie! Not precisely\r\nyoung and beautiful, but as game as they make them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were going to say\u2014\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, this fellow! He turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a\r\nsecond cousin or something of Evie\u2019s, though she didn\u2019t seem\r\nparticularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. The fellow is an\r\nabsolute outsider, anyone can see that. He\u2019s got a great black beard,\r\nand wears patent leather boots in all weathers! But the mater cottoned\r\nto him at once, took him on as secretary\u2014you know how she\u2019s always\r\nrunning a hundred societies?\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. No\r\ndoubt the fellow was very useful to her. But you could have knocked us\r\nall down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced\r\nthat she and Alfred were engaged! The fellow must be at least twenty\r\nyears younger than she is! It\u2019s simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but\r\nthere you are\u2014she is her own mistress, and she\u2019s married him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must be a difficult situation for you all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDifficult! It\u2019s damnable!\u201d\r\n\r\nThus it came about that, three days later, I descended from the train\r\nat Styles St. Mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason\r\nfor existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country\r\nlanes. John Cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out\r\nto the car.\r\n\r\n\u201cGot a drop or two of petrol still, you see,\u201d he remarked. \u201cMainly\r\nowing to the mater\u2019s activities.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe village of Styles St. Mary was situated about two miles from the\r\nlittle station, and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it. It\r\nwas a still, warm day in early July. As one looked out over the flat\r\nEssex country, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it\r\nseemed almost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great\r\nwar was running its appointed course. I felt I had suddenly strayed\r\ninto another world. As we turned in at the lodge gates, John said:\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll find it very quiet down here, Hastings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, that\u2019s just what I want.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. I drill\r\nwith the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms. My wife\r\nworks regularly \u2018on the land\u2019. She is up at five every morning to milk,\r\nand keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. It\u2019s a jolly good life taking\r\nit all round\u2014if it weren\u2019t for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp!\u201d He\r\nchecked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch. \u201cI wonder if we\u2019ve\r\ntime to pick up Cynthia. No, she\u2019ll have started from the hospital by\r\nnow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCynthia! That\u2019s not your wife?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, Cynthia is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of my mother\u2019s, the daughter of an old\r\nschoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor. He came a\r\ncropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. My mother came\r\nto the rescue, and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. She\r\nworks in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster, seven miles away.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house.\r\nA lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed,\r\nstraightened herself at our approach.\r\n\r\n\u201cHullo, Evie, here\u2019s our wounded hero! Mr. Hastings\u2014Miss Howard.\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip. I had an\r\nimpression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face. She was a\r\npleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly\r\nin its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with\r\nfeet to match\u2014these last encased in good thick boots. Her conversation,\r\nI soon found, was couched in the telegraphic style.\r\n\r\n\u201cWeeds grow like house afire. Can\u2019t keep even with \u2019em. Shall press you\r\nin. Better be careful.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful,\u201d I\r\nresponded.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t say it. Never does. Wish you hadn\u2019t later.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a cynic, Evie,\u201d said John, laughing. \u201cWhere\u2019s tea to-day\u2014inside\r\nor out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOut. Too fine a day to be cooped up in the house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome on then, you\u2019ve done enough gardening for to-day. \u2018The labourer\r\nis worthy of his hire\u2019, you know. Come and be refreshed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Miss Howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, \u201cI\u2019m\r\ninclined to agree with you.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade\r\nof a large sycamore.\r\n\r\nA figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps to\r\nmeet us.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy wife, Hastings,\u201d said John.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget my first sight of Mary Cavendish. Her tall,\r\nslender form, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of\r\nslumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful\r\ntawny eyes of hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman\u2019s\r\nthat I have ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed,\r\nwhich nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in\r\nan exquisitely civilised body\u2014all these things are burnt into my\r\nmemory. I shall never forget them.\r\n\r\nShe greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear\r\nvoice, and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I\r\nhad accepted John\u2019s invitation. Mrs. Cavendish gave me some tea, and\r\nher few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a\r\nthoroughly fascinating woman. An appreciative listener is always\r\nstimulating, and I described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents\r\nof my Convalescent Home, in a way which, I flatter myself, greatly\r\namused my hostess. John, of course, good fellow though he is, could\r\nhardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open French\r\nwindow near at hand:\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you\u2019ll write to the Princess after tea, Alfred? I\u2019ll write to\r\nLady Tadminster for the second day, myself. Or shall we wait until we\r\nhear from the Princess? In case of a refusal, Lady Tadminster might\r\nopen it the first day, and Mrs. Crosbie the second. Then there\u2019s the\r\nDuchess\u2014about the school f\u00eate.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was the murmur of a man\u2019s voice, and then Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s rose\r\nin reply:\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, certainly. After tea will do quite well. You are so thoughtful,\r\nAlfred dear.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe French window swung open a little wider, and a handsome\r\nwhite-haired old lady, with a somewhat masterful cast of features,\r\nstepped out of it on to the lawn. A man followed her, a suggestion of\r\ndeference in his manner.\r\n\r\nMrs. Inglethorp greeted me with effusion.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, if it isn\u2019t too delightful to see you again, Mr. Hastings, after\r\nall these years. Alfred, darling, Mr. Hastings\u2014my husband.\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked with some curiosity at \u201cAlfred darling\u201d. He certainly struck a\r\nrather alien note. I did not wonder at John objecting to his beard. It\r\nwas one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen. He wore\r\ngold-rimmed pince-nez, and had a curious impassivity of feature. It\r\nstruck me that he might look natural on a stage, but was strangely out\r\nof place in real life. His voice was rather deep and unctuous. He\r\nplaced a wooden hand in mine and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a pleasure, Mr. Hastings.\u201d Then, turning to his wife: \u201cEmily\r\ndearest, I think that cushion is a little damp.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe beamed fondly on him, as he substituted another with every\r\ndemonstration of the tenderest care. Strange infatuation of an\r\notherwise sensible woman!\r\n\r\nWith the presence of Mr. Inglethorp, a sense of constraint and veiled\r\nhostility seemed to settle down upon the company. Miss Howard, in\r\nparticular, took no pains to conceal her feelings. Mrs. Inglethorp,\r\nhowever, seemed to notice nothing unusual. Her volubility, which I\r\nremembered of old, had lost nothing in the intervening years, and she\r\npoured out a steady flood of conversation, mainly on the subject of the\r\nforthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place\r\nshortly. Occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of\r\ndays or dates. His watchful and attentive manner never varied. From the\r\nvery first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and I flatter\r\nmyself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd.\r\n\r\nPresently Mrs. Inglethorp turned to give some instructions about\r\nletters to Evelyn Howard, and her husband addressed me in his\r\npainstaking voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cIs soldiering your regular profession, Mr. Hastings?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, before the war I was in Lloyd\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you will return there after it is over?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps. Either that or a fresh start altogether.\u201d\r\n\r\nMary Cavendish leant forward.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat would you really choose as a profession, if you could just\r\nconsult your inclination?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that depends.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo secret hobby?\u201d she asked. \u201cTell me\u2014you\u2019re drawn to something?\r\nEveryone is\u2014usually something absurd.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll laugh at me.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve always had a secret hankering to be a detective!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe real thing\u2014Scotland Yard? Or Sherlock Holmes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Sherlock Holmes by all means. But really, seriously, I am awfully\r\ndrawn to it. I came across a man in Belgium once, a very famous\r\ndetective, and he quite inflamed me. He was a marvellous little fellow.\r\nHe used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of\r\nmethod. My system is based on his\u2014though of course I have progressed\r\nrather further. He was a funny little man, a great dandy, but\r\nwonderfully clever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLike a good detective story myself,\u201d remarked Miss Howard. \u201cLots of\r\nnonsense written, though. Criminal discovered in last chapter. Everyone\r\ndumbfounded. Real crime\u2014you\u2019d know at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere have been a great number of undiscovered crimes,\u201d I argued.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mean the police, but the people that are right in it. The\r\nfamily. You couldn\u2019t really hoodwink them. They\u2019d know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen,\u201d I said, much amused, \u201cyou think that if you were mixed up in a\r\ncrime, say a murder, you\u2019d be able to spot the murderer right off?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course I should. Mightn\u2019t be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers.\r\nBut I\u2019m certain I\u2019d know. I\u2019d feel it in my fingertips if he came near\r\nme.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt might be a \u2018she\u2019,\u201d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\u201cMight. But murder\u2019s a violent crime. Associate it more with a man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot in a case of poisoning.\u201d Mrs. Cavendish\u2019s clear voice startled me.\r\n\u201cDr. Bauerstein was saying yesterday that, owing to the general\r\nignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession,\r\nthere were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Mary, what a gruesome conversation!\u201d cried Mrs. Inglethorp. \u201cIt\r\nmakes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave. Oh, there\u2019s\r\nCynthia!\u201d\r\n\r\nA young girl in V.A.D. uniform ran lightly across the lawn.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Cynthia, you are late to-day. This is Mr. Hastings\u2014Miss Murdoch.\u201d\r\n\r\nCynthia Murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life and\r\nvigour. She tossed off her little V.A.D. cap, and I admired the great\r\nloose waves of her auburn hair, and the smallness and whiteness of the\r\nhand she held out to claim her tea. With dark eyes and eyelashes she\r\nwould have been a beauty.\r\n\r\nShe flung herself down on the ground beside John, and as I handed her a\r\nplate of sandwiches she smiled up at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cSit down here on the grass, do. It\u2019s ever so much nicer.\u201d\r\n\r\nI dropped down obediently.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou work at Tadminster, don\u2019t you, Miss Murdoch?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor my sins.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo they bully you, then?\u201d I asked, smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like to see them!\u201d cried Cynthia with dignity.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have got a cousin who is nursing,\u201d I remarked. \u201cAnd she is terrified\r\nof \u2018Sisters\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t wonder. Sisters _are_, you know, Mr. Hastings. They simp-ly\r\n_are_! You\u2019ve no idea! But I\u2019m not a nurse, thank heaven, I work in the\r\ndispensary.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow many people do you poison?\u201d I asked, smiling.\r\n\r\nCynthia smiled too.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, hundreds!\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cCynthia,\u201d called Mrs. Inglethorp, \u201cdo you think you could write a few\r\nnotes for me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, Aunt Emily.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe jumped up promptly, and something in her manner reminded me that\r\nher position was a dependent one, and that Mrs. Inglethorp, kind as she\r\nmight be in the main, did not allow her to forget it.\r\n\r\nMy hostess turned to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cJohn will show you your room. Supper is at half-past seven. We have\r\ngiven up late dinner for some time now. Lady Tadminster, our Member\u2019s\r\nwife\u2014she was the late Lord Abbotsbury\u2019s daughter\u2014does the same. She\r\nagrees with me that one must set an example of economy. We are quite a\r\nwar household; nothing is wasted here\u2014every scrap of waste paper, even,\r\nis saved and sent away in sacks.\u201d\r\n\r\nI expressed my appreciation, and John took me into the house and up the\r\nbroad staircase, which forked right and left half-way to different\r\nwings of the building. My room was in the left wing, and looked out\r\nover the park.\r\n\r\nJohn left me, and a few minutes later I saw him from my window walking\r\nslowly across the grass arm in arm with Cynthia Murdoch. I heard Mrs.\r\nInglethorp call \u201cCynthia\u201d impatiently, and the girl started and ran\r\nback to the house. At the same moment, a man stepped out from the\r\nshadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction. He looked\r\nabout forty, very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face. Some\r\nviolent emotion seemed to be mastering him. He looked up at my window\r\nas he passed, and I recognized him, though he had changed much in the\r\nfifteen years that had elapsed since we last met. It was John\u2019s younger\r\nbrother, Lawrence Cavendish. I wondered what it was that had brought\r\nthat singular expression to his face.\r\n\r\nThen I dismissed him from my mind, and returned to the contemplation of\r\nmy own affairs.\r\n\r\nThe evening passed pleasantly enough; and I dreamed that night of that\r\nenigmatical woman, Mary Cavendish.\r\n\r\nThe next morning dawned bright and sunny, and I was full of the\r\nanticipation of a delightful visit.\r\n\r\nI did not see Mrs. Cavendish until lunch-time, when she volunteered to\r\ntake me for a walk, and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the\r\nwoods, returning to the house about five.\r\n\r\nAs we entered the large hall, John beckoned us both into the\r\nsmoking-room. I saw at once by his face that something disturbing had\r\noccurred. We followed him in, and he shut the door after us.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here, Mary, there\u2019s the deuce of a mess. Evie\u2019s had a row with\r\nAlfred Inglethorp, and she\u2019s off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEvie? Off?\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn nodded gloomily.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; you see she went to the mater, and\u2014Oh,\u2014here\u2019s Evie herself.\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Howard entered. Her lips were set grimly together, and she carried\r\na small suit-case. She looked excited and determined, and slightly on\r\nthe defensive.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt any rate,\u201d she burst out, \u201cI\u2019ve spoken my mind!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Evelyn,\u201d cried Mrs. Cavendish, \u201cthis can\u2019t be true!\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Howard nodded grimly.\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue enough! Afraid I said some things to Emily she won\u2019t forget or\r\nforgive in a hurry. Don\u2019t mind if they\u2019ve only sunk in a bit. Probably\r\nwater off a duck\u2019s back, though. I said right out: \u2018You\u2019re an old\r\nwoman, Emily, and there\u2019s no fool like an old fool. The man\u2019s twenty\r\nyears younger than you, and don\u2019t you fool yourself as to what he\r\nmarried you for. Money! Well, don\u2019t let him have too much of it. Farmer\r\nRaikes has got a very pretty young wife. Just ask your Alfred how much\r\ntime he spends over there.\u2019 She was very angry. Natural! I went on,\r\n\u2018I\u2019m going to warn you, whether you like it or not. That man would as\r\nsoon murder you in your bed as look at you. He\u2019s a bad lot. You can say\r\nwhat you like to me, but remember what I\u2019ve told you. He\u2019s a bad lot!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Howard made an extremely expressive grimace.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Darling Alfred\u2019\u2014\u2018dearest Alfred\u2019\u2014\u2018wicked calumnies\u2019 \u2014\u2018wicked\r\nlies\u2019\u2014\u2018wicked woman\u2019\u2014to accuse her \u2018dear husband!\u2019 The sooner I left\r\nher house the better. So I\u2019m off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut not now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis minute!\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment we sat and stared at her. Finally John Cavendish, finding\r\nhis persuasions of no avail, went off to look up the trains. His wife\r\nfollowed him, murmuring something about persuading Mrs. Inglethorp to\r\nthink better of it.\r\n\r\nAs she left the room, Miss Howard\u2019s face changed. She leant towards me\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Hastings, you\u2019re honest. I can trust you?\u201d\r\n\r\nI was a little startled. She laid her hand on my arm, and sank her\r\nvoice to a whisper.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook after her, Mr. Hastings. My poor Emily. They\u2019re a lot of\r\nsharks\u2014all of them. Oh, I know what I\u2019m talking about. There isn\u2019t one\r\nof them that\u2019s not hard up and trying to get money out of her. I\u2019ve\r\nprotected her as much as I could. Now I\u2019m out of the way, they\u2019ll\r\nimpose upon her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course, Miss Howard,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ll do everything I can, but I\u2019m\r\nsure you\u2019re excited and overwrought.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger.\r\n\r\n\u201cYoung man, trust me. I\u2019ve lived in the world rather longer than you\r\nhave. All I ask you is to keep your eyes open. You\u2019ll see what I mean.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe throb of the motor came through the open window, and Miss Howard\r\nrose and moved to the door. John\u2019s voice sounded outside. With her hand\r\non the handle, she turned her head over her shoulder, and beckoned to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\u201cAbove all, Mr. Hastings, watch that devil\u2014her husband!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was no time for more. Miss Howard was swallowed up in an eager\r\nchorus of protests and good-byes. The Inglethorps did not appear.\r\n\r\nAs the motor drove away, Mrs. Cavendish suddenly detached herself from\r\nthe group, and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall\r\nbearded man who had been evidently making for the house. The colour\r\nrose in her cheeks as she held out her hand to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho is that?\u201d I asked sharply, for instinctively I distrusted the man.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Dr. Bauerstein,\u201d said John shortly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who is Dr. Bauerstein?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s staying in the village doing a rest cure, after a bad nervous\r\nbreakdown. He\u2019s a London specialist; a very clever man\u2014one of the\r\ngreatest living experts on poisons, I believe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s a great friend of Mary\u2019s,\u201d put in Cynthia, the irrepressible.\r\n\r\nJohn Cavendish frowned and changed the subject.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome for a stroll, Hastings. This has been a most rotten business. She\r\nalways had a rough tongue, but there is no stauncher friend in England\r\nthan Evelyn Howard.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe took the path through the plantation, and we walked down to the\r\nvillage through the woods which bordered one side of the estate.\r\n\r\nAs we passed through one of the gates on our way home again, a pretty\r\nyoung woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty girl,\u201d I remarked appreciatively.\r\n\r\nJohn\u2019s face hardened.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is Mrs. Raikes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe one that Miss Howard\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said John, with rather unnecessary abruptness.\r\n\r\nI thought of the white-haired old lady in the big house, and that vivid\r\nwicked little face that had just smiled into ours, and a vague chill of\r\nforeboding crept over me. I brushed it aside.\r\n\r\n\u201cStyles is really a glorious old place,\u201d I said to John.\r\n\r\nHe nodded rather gloomily.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s a fine property. It\u2019ll be mine some day\u2014should be mine now\r\nby rights, if my father had only made a decent will. And then I\r\nshouldn\u2019t be so damned hard up as I am now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHard up, are you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Hastings, I don\u2019t mind telling you that I\u2019m at my wits\u2019 end\r\nfor money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t your brother help you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLawrence? He\u2019s gone through every penny he ever had, publishing rotten\r\nverses in fancy bindings. No, we\u2019re an impecunious lot. My mother\u2019s\r\nalways been awfully good to us, I must say. That is, up to now. Since\r\nher marriage, of course\u2014\u2014\u201d he broke off, frowning.\r\n\r\nFor the first time I felt that, with Evelyn Howard, something\r\nindefinable had gone from the atmosphere. Her presence had spelt\r\nsecurity. Now that security was removed\u2014and the air seemed rife with\r\nsuspicion. The sinister face of Dr. Bauerstein recurred to me\r\nunpleasantly. A vague suspicion of everyone and everything filled my\r\nmind. Just for a moment I had a premonition of approaching evil.\r\n\nI had arrived at Styles on the 5th of July. I come now to the events of\r\nthe 16th and 17th of that month. For the convenience of the reader I\r\nwill recapitulate the incidents of those days in as exact a manner as\r\npossible. They were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of\r\nlong and tedious cross-examinations.\r\n\r\nI received a letter from Evelyn Howard a couple of days after her\r\ndeparture, telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital in\r\nMiddlingham, a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away, and begging\r\nme to let her know if Mrs. Inglethorp should show any wish to be\r\nreconciled.\r\n\r\nThe only fly in the ointment of my peaceful days was Mrs. Cavendish\u2019s\r\nextraordinary, and, for my part, unaccountable preference for the\r\nsociety of Dr. Bauerstein. What she saw in the man I cannot imagine,\r\nbut she was always asking him up to the house, and often went off for\r\nlong expeditions with him. I must confess that I was quite unable to\r\nsee his attraction.\r\n\r\nThe 16th of July fell on a Monday. It was a day of turmoil. The famous\r\nbazaar had taken place on Saturday, and an entertainment, in connection\r\nwith the same charity, at which Mrs. Inglethorp was to recite a War\r\npoem, was to be held that night. We were all busy during the morning\r\narranging and decorating the Hall in the village where it was to take\r\nplace. We had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the\r\ngarden. I noticed that John\u2019s manner was somewhat unusual. He seemed\r\nvery excited and restless.\r\n\r\nAfter tea, Mrs. Inglethorp went to lie down to rest before her efforts\r\nin the evening and I challenged Mary Cavendish to a single at tennis.\r\n\r\nAbout a quarter to seven, Mrs. Inglethorp called us that we should be\r\nlate as supper was early that night. We had rather a scramble to get\r\nready in time; and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nThe entertainment was a great success, Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s recitation\r\nreceiving tremendous applause. There were also some tableaux in which\r\nCynthia took part. She did not return with us, having been asked to a\r\nsupper party, and to remain the night with some friends who had been\r\nacting with her in the tableaux.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, Mrs. Inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast, as\r\nshe was rather overtired; but she appeared in her briskest mood about\r\n12.30, and swept Lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuch a charming invitation from Mrs. Rolleston. Lady Tadminster\u2019s\r\nsister, you know. The Rollestons came over with the Conqueror\u2014one of\r\nour oldest families.\u201d\r\n\r\nMary had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with Dr.\r\nBauerstein.\r\n\r\nWe had a pleasant luncheon, and as we drove away Lawrence suggested\r\nthat we should return by Tadminster, which was barely a mile out of our\r\nway, and pay a visit to Cynthia in her dispensary. Mrs. Inglethorp\r\nreplied that this was an excellent idea, but as she had several letters\r\nto write she would drop us there, and we could come back with Cynthia\r\nin the pony-trap.\r\n\r\nWe were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter, until Cynthia\r\nappeared to vouch for us, looking very cool and sweet in her long white\r\noverall. She took us up to her sanctum, and introduced us to her fellow\r\ndispenser, a rather awe-inspiring individual, whom Cynthia cheerily\r\naddressed as \u201cNibs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a lot of bottles!\u201d I exclaimed, as my eye travelled round the\r\nsmall room. \u201cDo you really know what\u2019s in them all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSay something original,\u201d groaned Cynthia. \u201cEvery single person who\r\ncomes up here says that. We are really thinking of bestowing a prize on\r\nthe first individual who does _not_ say: \u2018What a lot of bottles!\u2019 And I\r\nknow the next thing you\u2019re going to say is: \u2018How many people have you\r\npoisoned?\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nI pleaded guilty with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone by\r\nmistake, you wouldn\u2019t joke about it. Come on, let\u2019s have tea. We\u2019ve got\r\nall sorts of secret stories in that cupboard. No, Lawrence\u2014that\u2019s the\r\npoison cupboard. The big cupboard\u2014that\u2019s right.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had a very cheery tea, and assisted Cynthia to wash up afterwards.\r\nWe had just put away the last tea-spoon when a knock came at the door.\r\nThe countenances of Cynthia and Nibs were suddenly petrified into a\r\nstern and forbidding expression.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in,\u201d said Cynthia, in a sharp professional tone.\r\n\r\nA young and rather scared looking nurse appeared with a bottle which\r\nshe proffered to Nibs, who waved her towards Cynthia with the somewhat\r\nenigmatical remark:\r\n\r\n\u201c_I_\u2019m not really here to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\nCynthia took the bottle and examined it with the severity of a judge.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis should have been sent up this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSister is very sorry. She forgot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSister should read the rules outside the door.\u201d\r\n\r\nI gathered from the little nurse\u2019s expression that there was not the\r\nleast likelihood of her having the hardihood to retail this message to\r\nthe dreaded \u201cSister\u201d.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo now it can\u2019t be done until to-morrow,\u201d finished Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think you could possibly let us have it to-night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Cynthia graciously, \u201cwe are very busy, but if we have time\r\nit shall be done.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe little nurse withdrew, and Cynthia promptly took a jar from the\r\nshelf, refilled the bottle, and placed it on the table outside the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nI laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cDiscipline must be maintained?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. Come out on our little balcony. You can see all the outside\r\nwards there.\u201d\r\n\r\nI followed Cynthia and her friend and they pointed out the different\r\nwards to me. Lawrence remained behind, but after a few moments Cynthia\r\ncalled to him over her shoulder to come and join us. Then she looked at\r\nher watch.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing more to do, Nibs?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right. Then we can lock up and go.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had seen Lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon. Compared\r\nto John, he was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know. He was\r\nthe opposite of his brother in almost every respect, being unusually\r\nshy and reserved. Yet he had a certain charm of manner, and I fancied\r\nthat, if one really knew him well, one could have a deep affection for\r\nhim. I had always fancied that his manner to Cynthia was rather\r\nconstrained, and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him.\r\nBut they were both gay enough this afternoon, and chatted together like\r\na couple of children.\r\n\r\nAs we drove through the village, I remembered that I wanted some\r\nstamps, so accordingly we pulled up at the post office.\r\n\r\nAs I came out again, I cannoned into a little man who was just\r\nentering. I drew aside and apologised, when suddenly, with a loud\r\nexclamation, he clasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon ami_ Hastings!\u201d he cried. \u201cIt is indeed _mon ami_ Hastings!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot!\u201d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\nI turned to the pony-trap.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a very pleasant meeting for me, Miss Cynthia. This is my old\r\nfriend, Monsieur Poirot, whom I have not seen for years.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, we know Monsieur Poirot,\u201d said Cynthia gaily. \u201cBut I had no idea\r\nhe was a friend of yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d said Poirot seriously. \u201cI know Mademoiselle Cynthia. It\r\nis by the charity of that good Mrs. Inglethorp that I am here.\u201d Then,\r\nas I looked at him inquiringly: \u201cYes, my friend, she had kindly\r\nextended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who, alas, are\r\nrefugees from their native land. We Belgians will always remember her\r\nwith gratitude.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot was an extraordinary looking little man. He was hardly more than\r\nfive feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity. His\r\nhead was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little\r\non one side. His moustache was very stiff and military. The neatness of\r\nhis attire was almost incredible. I believe a speck of dust would have\r\ncaused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified\r\nlittle man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his\r\ntime one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police. As a\r\ndetective, his _flair_ had been extraordinary, and he had achieved\r\ntriumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellow\r\nBelgians, and I promised to go and see him at an early date. Then he\r\nraised his hat with a flourish to Cynthia, and we drove away.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a dear little man,\u201d said Cynthia. \u201cI\u2019d no idea you knew him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been entertaining a celebrity unawares,\u201d I replied.\r\n\r\nAnd, for the rest of the way home, I recited to them the various\r\nexploits and triumphs of Hercule Poirot.\r\n\r\nWe arrived back in a very cheerful mood. As we entered the hall, Mrs.\r\nInglethorp came out of her boudoir. She looked flushed and upset.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s you,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs there anything the matter, Aunt Emily?\u201d asked Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly not,\u201d said Mrs. Inglethorp sharply. \u201cWhat should there be?\u201d\r\nThen catching sight of Dorcas, the parlourmaid, going into the\r\ndining-room, she called to her to bring some stamps into the boudoir.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, m\u2019m.\u201d The old servant hesitated, then added diffidently: \u201cDon\u2019t\r\nyou think, m\u2019m, you\u2019d better get to bed? You\u2019re looking very tired.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right, Dorcas\u2014yes\u2014no\u2014not now. I\u2019ve some letters I must\r\nfinish by post-time. Have you lighted the fire in my room as I told\r\nyou?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, m\u2019m.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll go to bed directly after supper.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe went into the boudoir again, and Cynthia stared after her.\r\n\r\n\u201cGoodness gracious! I wonder what\u2019s up?\u201d she said to Lawrence.\r\n\r\nHe did not seem to have heard her, for without a word he turned on his\r\nheel and went out of the house.\r\n\r\nI suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and, Cynthia agreeing,\r\nI ran upstairs to fetch my racquet.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cavendish was coming down the stairs. It may have been my fancy,\r\nbut she, too, was looking odd and disturbed.\r\n\r\n\u201cHad a good walk with Dr. Bauerstein?\u201d I asked, trying to appear as\r\nindifferent as I could.\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go,\u201d she replied abruptly. \u201cWhere is Mrs. Inglethorp?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the boudoir.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer hand clenched itself on the banisters, then she seemed to nerve\r\nherself for some encounter, and went rapidly past me down the stairs\r\nacross the hall to the boudoir, the door of which she shut behind her.\r\n\r\nAs I ran out to the tennis court a few moments later, I had to pass the\r\nopen boudoir window, and was unable to help overhearing the following\r\nscrap of dialogue. Mary Cavendish was saying in the voice of a woman\r\ndesperately controlling herself:\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you won\u2019t show it to me?\u201d\r\n\r\nTo which Mrs. Inglethorp replied:\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Mary, it has nothing to do with that matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen show it to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you it is not what you imagine. It does not concern you in the\r\nleast.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo which Mary Cavendish replied, with a rising bitterness:\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course, I might have known you would shield him.\u201d\r\n\r\nCynthia was waiting for me, and greeted me eagerly with:\r\n\r\n\u201cI say! There\u2019s been the most awful row! I\u2019ve got it all out of\r\nDorcas.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat kind of a row?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBetween Aunt Emily and _him_. I do hope she\u2019s found him out at last!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas Dorcas there, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course not. She \u2018happened to be near the door\u2019. It was a real old\r\nbust-up. I do wish I knew what it was all about.\u201d\r\n\r\nI thought of Mrs. Raikes\u2019s gipsy face, and Evelyn Howard\u2019s warnings,\r\nbut wisely decided to hold my peace, whilst Cynthia exhausted every\r\npossible hypothesis, and cheerfully hoped, \u201cAunt Emily will send him\r\naway, and will never speak to him again.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was anxious to get hold of John, but he was nowhere to be seen.\r\nEvidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon. I tried\r\nto forget the few words I had overheard; but, do what I would, I could\r\nnot dismiss them altogether from my mind. What was Mary Cavendish\u2019s\r\nconcern in the matter?\r\n\r\nMr. Inglethorp was in the drawing-room when I came down to supper. His\r\nface was impassive as ever, and the strange unreality of the man struck\r\nme afresh.\r\n\r\nMrs. Inglethorp came down last. She still looked agitated, and during\r\nthe meal there was a somewhat constrained silence. Inglethorp was\r\nunusually quiet. As a rule, he surrounded his wife with little\r\nattentions, placing a cushion at her back, and altogether playing the\r\npart of the devoted husband. Immediately after supper, Mrs. Inglethorp\r\nretired to her boudoir again.\r\n\r\n\u201cSend my coffee in here, Mary,\u201d she called. \u201cI\u2019ve just five minutes to\r\ncatch the post.\u201d\r\n\r\nCynthia and I went and sat by the open window in the drawing-room. Mary\r\nCavendish brought our coffee to us. She seemed excited.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you young people want lights, or do you enjoy the twilight?\u201d she\r\nasked. \u201cWill you take Mrs. Inglethorp her coffee, Cynthia? I will pour\r\nit out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not trouble, Mary,\u201d said Inglethorp. \u201cI will take it to Emily.\u201d He\r\npoured it out, and went out of the room carrying it carefully.\r\n\r\nLawrence followed him, and Mrs. Cavendish sat down by us.\r\n\r\nWe three sat for some time in silence. It was a glorious night, hot and\r\nstill. Mrs. Cavendish fanned herself gently with a palm leaf.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost too hot,\u201d she murmured. \u201cWe shall have a thunderstorm.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlas, that these harmonious moments can never endure! My paradise was\r\nrudely shattered by the sound of a well known, and heartily disliked,\r\nvoice in the hall.\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Bauerstein!\u201d exclaimed Cynthia. \u201cWhat a funny time to come.\u201d\r\n\r\nI glanced jealously at Mary Cavendish, but she seemed quite\r\nundisturbed, the delicate pallor of her cheeks did not vary.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments, Alfred Inglethorp had ushered the doctor in, the\r\nlatter laughing, and protesting that he was in no fit state for a\r\ndrawing-room. In truth, he presented a sorry spectacle, being literally\r\nplastered with mud.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have you been doing, doctor?\u201d cried Mrs. Cavendish.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must make my apologies,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cI did not really mean to\r\ncome in, but Mr. Inglethorp insisted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Bauerstein, you are in a plight,\u201d said John, strolling in from\r\nthe hall. \u201cHave some coffee, and tell us what you have been up to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, I will.\u201d He laughed rather ruefully, as he described how he\r\nhad discovered a very rare species of fern in an inaccessible place,\r\nand in his efforts to obtain it had lost his footing, and slipped\r\nignominiously into a neighbouring pond.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe sun soon dried me off,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid my appearance is\r\nvery disreputable.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, Mrs. Inglethorp called to Cynthia from the hall, and\r\nthe girl ran out.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust carry up my despatch-case, will you, dear? I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe door into the hall was a wide one. I had risen when Cynthia did,\r\nJohn was close by me. There were therefore three witnesses who could\r\nswear that Mrs. Inglethorp was carrying her coffee, as yet untasted, in\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\nMy evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of Dr.\r\nBauerstein. It seemed to me the man would never go. He rose at last,\r\nhowever, and I breathed a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll walk down to the village with you,\u201d said Mr. Inglethorp. \u201cI must\r\nsee our agent over those estate accounts.\u201d He turned to John. \u201cNo one\r\nneed sit up. I will take the latch-key.\u201d\r\n\nTo make this part of my story clear, I append the following plan of the\r\nfirst floor of Styles. The servants\u2019 rooms are reached through the door\r\nB. They have no communication with the right wing, where the\r\nInglethorps\u2019 rooms were situated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       01\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed to be the middle of the night when I was awakened by Lawrence\r\nCavendish. He had a candle in his hand, and the agitation of his face\r\ntold me at once that something was seriously wrong.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d I asked, sitting up in bed, and trying to collect\r\nmy scattered thoughts.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are afraid my mother is very ill. She seems to be having some kind\r\nof fit. Unfortunately she has locked herself in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll come at once.\u201d\r\n\r\nI sprang out of bed; and, pulling on a dressing-gown, followed Lawrence\r\nalong the passage and the gallery to the right wing of the house.\r\n\r\nJohn Cavendish joined us, and one or two of the servants were standing\r\nround in a state of awe-stricken excitement. Lawrence turned to his\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think we had better do?\u201d\r\n\r\nNever, I thought, had his indecision of character been more apparent.\r\n\r\nJohn rattled the handle of Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s door violently, but with\r\nno effect. It was obviously locked or bolted on the inside. The whole\r\nhousehold was aroused by now. The most alarming sounds were audible\r\nfrom the interior of the room. Clearly something must be done.\r\n\r\n\u201cTry going through Mr. Inglethorp\u2019s room, sir,\u201d cried Dorcas. \u201cOh, the\r\npoor mistress!\u201d\r\n\r\nSuddenly I realized that Alfred Inglethorp was not with us\u2014that he\r\nalone had given no sign of his presence. John opened the door of his\r\nroom. It was pitch dark, but Lawrence was following with the candle,\r\nand by its feeble light we saw that the bed had not been slept in, and\r\nthat there was no sign of the room having been occupied.\r\n\r\nWe went straight to the connecting door. That, too, was locked or\r\nbolted on the inside. What was to be done?\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, dear, sir,\u201d cried Dorcas, wringing her hands, \u201cwhat ever shall we\r\ndo?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must try and break the door in, I suppose. It\u2019ll be a tough job,\r\nthough. Here, let one of the maids go down and wake Baily and tell him\r\nto go for Dr. Wilkins at once. Now then, we\u2019ll have a try at the door.\r\nHalf a moment, though, isn\u2019t there a door into Miss Cynthia\u2019s rooms?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, but that\u2019s always bolted. It\u2019s never been undone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we might just see.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe ran rapidly down the corridor to Cynthia\u2019s room. Mary Cavendish was\r\nthere, shaking the girl\u2014who must have been an unusually sound\r\nsleeper\u2014and trying to wake her.\r\n\r\nIn a moment or two he was back.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo good. That\u2019s bolted too. We must break in the door. I think this\r\none is a shade less solid than the one in the passage.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe strained and heaved together. The framework of the door was solid,\r\nand for a long time it resisted our efforts, but at last we felt it\r\ngive beneath our weight, and finally, with a resounding crash, it was\r\nburst open.\r\n\r\nWe stumbled in together, Lawrence still holding his candle. Mrs.\r\nInglethorp was lying on the bed, her whole form agitated by violent\r\nconvulsions, in one of which she must have overturned the table beside\r\nher. As we entered, however, her limbs relaxed, and she fell back upon\r\nthe pillows.\r\n\r\nJohn strode across the room, and lit the gas. Turning to Annie, one of\r\nthe housemaids, he sent her downstairs to the dining-room for brandy.\r\nThen he went across to his mother whilst I unbolted the door that gave\r\non the corridor.\r\n\r\nI turned to Lawrence, to suggest that I had better leave them now that\r\nthere was no further need of my services, but the words were frozen on\r\nmy lips. Never have I seen such a ghastly look on any man\u2019s face. He\r\nwas white as chalk, the candle he held in his shaking hand was\r\nsputtering onto the carpet, and his eyes, petrified with terror, or\r\nsome such kindred emotion, stared fixedly over my head at a point on\r\nthe further wall. It was as though he had seen something that turned\r\nhim to stone. I instinctively followed the direction of his eyes, but I\r\ncould see nothing unusual. The still feebly flickering ashes in the\r\ngrate, and the row of prim ornaments on the mantelpiece, were surely\r\nharmless enough.\r\n\r\nThe violence of Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s attack seemed to be passing. She was\r\nable to speak in short gasps.\r\n\r\n\u201cBetter now\u2014very sudden\u2014stupid of me\u2014to lock myself in.\u201d\r\n\r\nA shadow fell on the bed and, looking up, I saw Mary Cavendish standing\r\nnear the door with her arm around Cynthia. She seemed to be supporting\r\nthe girl, who looked utterly dazed and unlike herself. Her face was\r\nheavily flushed, and she yawned repeatedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor Cynthia is quite frightened,\u201d said Mrs. Cavendish in a low clear\r\nvoice. She herself, I noticed, was dressed in her white land smock.\r\nThen it must be later than I thought. I saw that a faint streak of\r\ndaylight was showing through the curtains of the windows, and that the\r\nclock on the mantelpiece pointed to close upon five o\u2019clock.\r\n\r\nA strangled cry from the bed startled me. A fresh access of pain seized\r\nthe unfortunate old lady. The convulsions were of a violence terrible\r\nto behold. Everything was confusion. We thronged round her, powerless\r\nto help or alleviate. A final convulsion lifted her from the bed, until\r\nshe appeared to rest upon her head and her heels, with her body arched\r\nin an extraordinary manner. In vain Mary and John tried to administer\r\nmore brandy. The moments flew. Again the body arched itself in that\r\npeculiar fashion.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, Dr. Bauerstein pushed his way authoritatively into the\r\nroom. For one instant he stopped dead, staring at the figure on the\r\nbed, and, at the same instant, Mrs. Inglethorp cried out in a strangled\r\nvoice, her eyes fixed on the doctor:\r\n\r\n\u201cAlfred\u2014Alfred\u2014\u2014\u201d Then she fell back motionless on the pillows.\r\n\r\nWith a stride, the doctor reached the bed, and seizing her arms worked\r\nthem energetically, applying what I knew to be artificial respiration.\r\nHe issued a few short sharp orders to the servants. An imperious wave\r\nof his hand drove us all to the door. We watched him, fascinated,\r\nthough I think we all knew in our hearts that it was too late, and that\r\nnothing could be done now. I could see by the expression on his face\r\nthat he himself had little hope.\r\n\r\nFinally he abandoned his task, shaking his head gravely. At that\r\nmoment, we heard footsteps outside, and Dr. Wilkins, Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s\r\nown doctor, a portly, fussy little man, came bustling in.\r\n\r\nIn a few words Dr. Bauerstein explained how he had happened to be\r\npassing the lodge gates as the car came out, and had run up to the\r\nhouse as fast as he could, whilst the car went on to fetch Dr. Wilkins.\r\nWith a faint gesture of the hand, he indicated the figure on the bed.\r\n\r\n\u201cVe\u2014ry sad. Ve\u2014ry sad,\u201d murmured Dr. Wilkins. \u201cPoor dear lady. Always\r\ndid far too much\u2014far too much\u2014against my advice. I warned her. Her\r\nheart was far from strong. \u2018Take it easy,\u2019 I said to her,\r\n\u2018Take\u2014it\u2014easy\u2019. But no\u2014her zeal for good works was too great. Nature\r\nrebelled. Na\u2014ture\u2014re\u2014belled.\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Bauerstein, I noticed, was watching the local doctor narrowly. He\r\nstill kept his eyes fixed on him as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe convulsions were of a peculiar violence, Dr. Wilkins. I am sorry\r\nyou were not here in time to witness them. They were quite\u2014tetanic in\r\ncharacter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Dr. Wilkins wisely.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like to speak to you in private,\u201d said Dr. Bauerstein. He\r\nturned to John. \u201cYou do not object?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly not.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe all trooped out into the corridor, leaving the two doctors alone,\r\nand I heard the key turned in the lock behind us.\r\n\r\nWe went slowly down the stairs. I was violently excited. I have a\r\ncertain talent for deduction, and Dr. Bauerstein\u2019s manner had started a\r\nflock of wild surmises in my mind. Mary Cavendish laid her hand upon my\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it? Why did Dr. Bauerstein seem so\u2014peculiar?\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked at her.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know what I think?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cListen!\u201d I looked round, the others were out of earshot. I lowered my\r\nvoice to a whisper. \u201cI believe she has been poisoned! I\u2019m certain Dr.\r\nBauerstein suspects it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_What?_\u201d She shrank against the wall, the pupils of her eyes dilating\r\nwildly. Then, with a sudden cry that startled me, she cried out: \u201cNo,\r\nno\u2014not that\u2014not that!\u201d And breaking from me, fled up the stairs. I\r\nfollowed her, afraid that she was going to faint. I found her leaning\r\nagainst the bannisters, deadly pale. She waved me away impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no\u2014leave me. I\u2019d rather be alone. Let me just be quiet for a\r\nminute or two. Go down to the others.\u201d\r\n\r\nI obeyed her reluctantly. John and Lawrence were in the dining-room. I\r\njoined them. We were all silent, but I suppose I voiced the thoughts of\r\nus all when I at last broke it by saying:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is Mr. Inglethorp?\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not in the house.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur eyes met. Where _was_ Alfred Inglethorp? His absence was strange\r\nand inexplicable. I remembered Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s dying words. What lay\r\nbeneath them? What more could she have told us, if she had had time?\r\n\r\nAt last we heard the doctors descending the stairs. Dr. Wilkins was\r\nlooking important and excited, and trying to conceal an inward\r\nexultation under a manner of decorous calm. Dr. Bauerstein remained in\r\nthe background, his grave bearded face unchanged. Dr. Wilkins was the\r\nspokesman for the two. He addressed himself to John:\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Cavendish, I should like your consent to a post-mortem.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that necessary?\u201d asked John gravely. A spasm of pain crossed his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Dr. Bauerstein.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean by that\u2014\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat neither Dr. Wilkins nor myself could give a death certificate\r\nunder the circumstances.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn bent his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn that case, I have no alternative but to agree.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Dr. Wilkins briskly. \u201cWe propose that it should take\r\nplace to-morrow night\u2014or rather to-night.\u201d And he glanced at the\r\ndaylight. \u201cUnder the circumstances, I am afraid an inquest can hardly\r\nbe avoided\u2014these formalities are necessary, but I beg that you won\u2019t\r\ndistress yourselves.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, and then Dr. Bauerstein drew two keys from his\r\npocket, and handed them to John.\r\n\r\n\u201cThese are the keys of the two rooms. I have locked them and, in my\r\nopinion, they would be better kept locked for the present.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctors then departed.\r\n\r\nI had been turning over an idea in my head, and I felt that the moment\r\nhad now come to broach it. Yet I was a little chary of doing so. John,\r\nI knew, had a horror of any kind of publicity, and was an easygoing\r\noptimist, who preferred never to meet trouble half-way. It might be\r\ndifficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan. Lawrence, on the\r\nother hand, being less conventional, and having more imagination, I\r\nfelt I might count upon as an ally. There was no doubt that the moment\r\nhad come for me to take the lead.\r\n\r\n\u201cJohn,\u201d I said, \u201cI am going to ask you something.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou remember my speaking of my friend Poirot? The Belgian who is here?\r\nHe has been a most famous detective.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI want you to let me call him in\u2014to investigate this matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2014now? Before the post-mortem?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, time is an advantage if\u2014if\u2014there has been foul play.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRubbish!\u201d cried Lawrence angrily. \u201cIn my opinion the whole thing is a\r\nmare\u2019s nest of Bauerstein\u2019s! Wilkins hadn\u2019t an idea of such a thing,\r\nuntil Bauerstein put it into his head. But, like all specialists,\r\nBauerstein\u2019s got a bee in his bonnet. Poisons are his hobby, so of\r\ncourse he sees them everywhere.\u201d\r\n\r\nI confess that I was surprised by Lawrence\u2019s attitude. He was so seldom\r\nvehement about anything.\r\n\r\nJohn hesitated.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t feel as you do, Lawrence,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI\u2019m inclined to\r\ngive Hastings a free hand, though I should prefer to wait a bit. We\r\ndon\u2019t want any unnecessary scandal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d I cried eagerly, \u201cyou need have no fear of that. Poirot is\r\ndiscretion itself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, then, have it your own way. I leave it in your hands.\r\nThough, if it is as we suspect, it seems a clear enough case. God\r\nforgive me if I am wronging him!\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch. It was six o\u2019clock. I determined to lose no time.\r\n\r\nFive minutes\u2019 delay, however, I allowed myself. I spent it in\r\nransacking the library until I discovered a medical book which gave a\r\ndescription of strychnine poisoning.\r\n\nThe house which the Belgians occupied in the village was quite close to\r\nthe park gates. One could save time by taking a narrow path through the\r\nlong grass, which cut off the detours of the winding drive. So I,\r\naccordingly, went that way. I had nearly reached the lodge, when my\r\nattention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me.\r\nIt was Mr. Inglethorp. Where had he been? How did he intend to explain\r\nhis absence?\r\n\r\nHe accosted me eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God! This is terrible! My poor wife! I have only just heard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cDenby kept me late last night. It was one o\u2019clock before we\u2019d\r\nfinished. Then I found that I\u2019d forgotten the latch-key after all. I\r\ndidn\u2019t want to arouse the household, so Denby gave me a bed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you hear the news?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWilkins knocked Denby up to tell him. My poor Emily! She was so\r\nself-sacrificing\u2014such a noble character. She over-taxed her strength.\u201d\r\n\r\nA wave of revulsion swept over me. What a consummate hypocrite the man\r\nwas!\r\n\r\n\u201cI must hurry on,\u201d I said, thankful that he did not ask me whither I\r\nwas bound.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes I was knocking at the door of Leastways Cottage.\r\n\r\nGetting no answer, I repeated my summons impatiently. A window above me\r\nwas cautiously opened, and Poirot himself looked out.\r\n\r\nHe gave an exclamation of surprise at seeing me. In a few brief words,\r\nI explained the tragedy that had occurred, and that I wanted his help.\r\n\r\n\u201cWait, my friend, I will let you in, and you shall recount to me the\r\naffair whilst I dress.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn a few moments he had unbarred the door, and I followed him up to his\r\nroom. There he installed me in a chair, and I related the whole story,\r\nkeeping back nothing, and omitting no circumstance, however\r\ninsignificant, whilst he himself made a careful and deliberate toilet.\r\n\r\nI told him of my awakening, of Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s dying words, of her\r\nhusband\u2019s absence, of the quarrel the day before, of the scrap of\r\nconversation between Mary and her mother-in-law that I had overheard,\r\nof the former quarrel between Mrs. Inglethorp and Evelyn Howard, and of\r\nthe latter\u2019s innuendoes.\r\n\r\nI was hardly as clear as I could wish. I repeated myself several times,\r\nand occasionally had to go back to some detail that I had forgotten.\r\nPoirot smiled kindly on me.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe mind is confused? Is it not so? Take time, _mon ami_. You are\r\nagitated; you are excited\u2014it is but natural. Presently, when we are\r\ncalmer, we will arrange the facts, neatly, each in his proper place. We\r\nwill examine\u2014and reject. Those of importance we will put on one side;\r\nthose of no importance, pouf!\u201d\u2014he screwed up his cherub-like face, and\r\npuffed comically enough\u2014\u201cblow them away!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all very well,\u201d I objected, \u201cbut how are you going to decide\r\nwhat is important, and what isn\u2019t? That always seems the difficulty to\r\nme.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head energetically. He was now arranging his moustache\r\nwith exquisite care.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot so. _Voyons!_ One fact leads to another\u2014so we continue. Does the\r\nnext fit in with that? _A merveille!_ Good! We can proceed. This next\r\nlittle fact\u2014no! Ah, that is curious! There is something missing\u2014a link\r\nin the chain that is not there. We examine. We search. And that little\r\ncurious fact, that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally,\r\nwe put it here!\u201d He made an extravagant gesture with his hand. \u201cIt is\r\nsignificant! It is tremendous!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cY\u2014es\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d Poirot shook his forefinger so fiercely at me that I quailed\r\nbefore it. \u201cBeware! Peril to the detective who says: \u2018It is so small\u2014it\r\ndoes not matter. It will not agree. I will forget it.\u2019 That way lies\r\nconfusion! Everything matters.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know. You always told me that. That\u2019s why I have gone into all the\r\ndetails of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I am pleased with you. You have a good memory, and you have given\r\nme the facts faithfully. Of the order in which you present them, I say\r\nnothing\u2014truly, it is deplorable! But I make allowances\u2014you are upset.\r\nTo that I attribute the circumstance that you have omitted one fact of\r\nparamount importance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have not told me if Mrs. Inglethorp ate well last night.\u201d\r\n\r\nI stared at him. Surely the war had affected the little man\u2019s brain. He\r\nwas carefully engaged in brushing his coat before putting it on, and\r\nseemed wholly engrossed in the task.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd, anyway, I don\u2019t see\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do not see? But it is of the first importance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t see why,\u201d I said, rather nettled. \u201cAs far as I can remember,\r\nshe didn\u2019t eat much. She was obviously upset, and it had taken her\r\nappetite away. That was only natural.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully, \u201cit was only natural.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe opened a drawer, and took out a small despatch-case, then turned to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow I am ready. We will proceed to the ch\u00e2teau, and study matters on\r\nthe spot. Excuse me, _mon ami_, you dressed in haste, and your tie is\r\non one side. Permit me.\u201d With a deft gesture, he rearranged it.\r\n\r\n\u201c_\u00c7a y est!_ Now, shall we start?\u201d\r\n\r\nWe hurried up the village, and turned in at the lodge gates. Poirot\r\nstopped for a moment, and gazed sorrowfully over the beautiful expanse\r\nof park, still glittering with morning dew.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo beautiful, so beautiful, and yet, the poor family, plunged in\r\nsorrow, prostrated with grief.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked at me keenly as he spoke, and I was aware that I reddened\r\nunder his prolonged gaze.\r\n\r\nWas the family prostrated by grief? Was the sorrow at Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s\r\ndeath so great? I realized that there was an emotional lack in the\r\natmosphere. The dead woman had not the gift of commanding love. Her\r\ndeath was a shock and a distress, but she would not be passionately\r\nregretted.\r\n\r\nPoirot seemed to follow my thoughts. He nodded his head gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, you are right,\u201d he said, \u201cit is not as though there was a blood\r\ntie. She has been kind and generous to these Cavendishes, but she was\r\nnot their own mother. Blood tells\u2014always remember that\u2014blood tells.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot,\u201d I said, \u201cI wish you would tell me why you wanted to know if\r\nMrs. Inglethorp ate well last night? I have been turning it over in my\r\nmind, but I can\u2019t see how it has anything to do with the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a minute or two as we walked along, but finally he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not mind telling you\u2014though, as you know, it is not my habit to\r\nexplain until the end is reached. The present contention is that Mrs.\r\nInglethorp died of strychnine poisoning, presumably administered in her\r\ncoffee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what time was the coffee served?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout eight o\u2019clock.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTherefore she drank it between then and half-past eight\u2014certainly not\r\nmuch later. Well, strychnine is a fairly rapid poison. Its effects\r\nwould be felt very soon, probably in about an hour. Yet, in Mrs.\r\nInglethorp\u2019s case, the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five\r\no\u2019clock the next morning: nine hours! But a heavy meal, taken at about\r\nthe same time as the poison, might retard its effects, though hardly to\r\nthat extent. Still, it is a possibility to be taken into account. But,\r\naccording to you, she ate very little for supper, and yet the symptoms\r\ndo not develop until early the next morning! Now that is a curious\r\ncircumstance, my friend. Something may arise at the autopsy to explain\r\nit. In the meantime, remember it.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs we neared the house, John came out and met us. His face looked weary\r\nand haggard.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a very dreadful business, Monsieur Poirot,\u201d he said. \u201cHastings\r\nhas explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI comprehend perfectly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, it is only suspicion so far. We have nothing to go upon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely. It is a matter of precaution only.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn turned to me, taking out his cigarette-case, and lighting a\r\ncigarette as he did so.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know that fellow Inglethorp is back?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I met him.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn flung the match into an adjacent flower bed, a proceeding which\r\nwas too much for Poirot\u2019s feelings. He retrieved it, and buried it\r\nneatly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s jolly difficult to know how to treat him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat difficulty will not exist long,\u201d pronounced Poirot quietly.\r\n\r\nJohn looked puzzled, not quite understanding the portent of this\r\ncryptic saying. He handed the two keys which Dr. Bauerstein had given\r\nhim to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cShow Monsieur Poirot everything he wants to see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe rooms are locked?\u201d asked Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Bauerstein considered it advisable.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen he is very sure. Well, that simplifies matters for us.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe went up together to the room of the tragedy. For convenience I\r\nappend a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       02\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoirot locked the door on the inside, and proceeded to a minute\r\ninspection of the room. He darted from one object to the other with the\r\nagility of a grasshopper. I remained by the door, fearing to obliterate\r\nany clues. Poirot, however, did not seem grateful to me for my\r\nforbearance.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have you, my friend,\u201d he cried, \u201cthat you remain there like\u2014how\r\ndo you say it?\u2014ah, yes, the stuck pig?\u201d\r\n\r\nI explained that I was afraid of obliterating any foot-marks.\r\n\r\n\u201cFoot-marks? But what an idea! There has already been practically an\r\narmy in the room! What foot-marks are we likely to find? No, come here\r\nand aid me in my search. I will put down my little case until I need\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe did so, on the round table by the window, but it was an ill-advised\r\nproceeding; for, the top of it being loose, it tilted up, and\r\nprecipitated the despatch-case on the floor.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh voil\u00e0 une table!_\u201d cried Poirot. \u201cAh, my friend, one may live in a\r\nbig house and yet have no comfort.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter which piece of moralizing, he resumed his search.\r\n\r\nA small purple despatch-case, with a key in the lock, on the\r\nwriting-table, engaged his attention for some time. He took out the key\r\nfrom the lock, and passed it to me to inspect. I saw nothing peculiar,\r\nhowever. It was an ordinary key of the Yale type, with a bit of twisted\r\nwire through the handle.\r\n\r\nNext, he examined the framework of the door we had broken in, assuring\r\nhimself that the bolt had really been shot. Then he went to the door\r\nopposite leading into Cynthia\u2019s room. That door was also bolted, as I\r\nhad stated. However, he went to the length of unbolting it, and opening\r\nand shutting it several times; this he did with the utmost precaution\r\nagainst making any noise. Suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed\r\nto rivet his attention. He examined it carefully, and then, nimbly\r\nwhipping out a pair of small forceps from his case, he drew out some\r\nminute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope.\r\n\r\nOn the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small\r\nsaucepan on it. A small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the\r\nsaucepan, and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood\r\nnear it.\r\n\r\nI wondered how I could have been so unobservant as to overlook this.\r\nHere was a clue worth having. Poirot delicately dipped his finger into\r\nliquid, and tasted it gingerly. He made a grimace.\r\n\r\n\u201cCocoa\u2014with\u2014I think\u2014rum in it.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe passed on to the debris on the floor, where the table by the bed had\r\nbeen overturned. A reading-lamp, some books, matches, a bunch of keys,\r\nand the crushed fragments of a coffee-cup lay scattered about.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, this is curious,\u201d said Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must confess that I see nothing particularly curious about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do not? Observe the lamp\u2014the chimney is broken in two places; they\r\nlie there as they fell. But see, the coffee-cup is absolutely smashed\r\nto powder.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said wearily, \u201cI suppose someone must have stepped on it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Poirot, in an odd voice. \u201cSomeone stepped on it.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe rose from his knees, and walked slowly across to the mantelpiece,\r\nwhere he stood abstractedly fingering the ornaments, and straightening\r\nthem\u2014a trick of his when he was agitated.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon ami_,\u201d he said, turning to me, \u201csomebody stepped on that cup,\r\ngrinding it to powder, and the reason they did so was either because it\r\ncontained strychnine or\u2014which is far more serious\u2014because it did not\r\ncontain strychnine!\u201d\r\n\r\nI made no reply. I was bewildered, but I knew that it was no good\r\nasking him to explain. In a moment or two he roused himself, and went\r\non with his investigations. He picked up the bunch of keys from the\r\nfloor, and twirling them round in his fingers finally selected one,\r\nvery bright and shining, which he tried in the lock of the purple\r\ndespatch-case. It fitted, and he opened the box, but after a moment\u2019s\r\nhesitation, closed and relocked it, and slipped the bunch of keys, as\r\nwell as the key that had originally stood in the lock, into his own\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no authority to go through these papers. But it should be\r\ndone\u2014at once!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the\r\nwash-stand. Crossing the room to the left-hand window, a round stain,\r\nhardly visible on the dark brown carpet, seemed to interest him\r\nparticularly. He went down on his knees, examining it minutely\u2014even\r\ngoing so far as to smell it.\r\n\r\nFinally, he poured a few drops of the cocoa into a test tube, sealing\r\nit up carefully. His next proceeding was to take out a little notebook.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have found in this room,\u201d he said, writing busily, \u201csix points of\r\ninterest. Shall I enumerate them, or will you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you,\u201d I replied hastily.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, then. One, a coffee-cup that has been ground into powder;\r\ntwo, a despatch-case with a key in the lock; three, a stain on the\r\nfloor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat may have been done some time ago,\u201d I interrupted.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee. Four, a\r\nfragment of some dark green fabric\u2014only a thread or two, but\r\nrecognizable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d I cried. \u201cThat was what you sealed up in the envelope.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. It may turn out to be a piece of one of Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s own\r\ndresses, and quite unimportant. We shall see. Five, _this_!\u201d With a\r\ndramatic gesture, he pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the\r\nfloor by the writing-table. \u201cIt must have been done since yesterday,\r\notherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with\r\nblotting-paper and a hot iron. One of my best hats once\u2014but that is not\r\nto the point.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was very likely done last night. We were very agitated. Or perhaps\r\nMrs. Inglethorp herself dropped her candle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou brought only one candle into the room?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Lawrence Cavendish was carrying it. But he was very upset. He\r\nseemed to see something over here\u201d\u2014I indicated the mantelpiece\u2014\u201cthat\r\nabsolutely paralysed him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is interesting,\u201d said Poirot quickly. \u201cYes, it is suggestive\u201d\u2014his\r\neye sweeping the whole length of the wall\u2014\u201cbut it was not his candle\r\nthat made this great patch, for you perceive that this is white grease;\r\nwhereas Monsieur Lawrence\u2019s candle, which is still on the\r\ndressing-table, is pink. On the other hand, Mrs. Inglethorp had no\r\ncandlestick in the room, only a reading-lamp.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen,\u201d I said, \u201cwhat do you deduce?\u201d\r\n\r\nTo which my friend only made a rather irritating reply, urging me to\r\nuse my own natural faculties.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the sixth point?\u201d I asked. \u201cI suppose it is the sample of cocoa.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully. \u201cI might have included that in the six,\r\nbut I did not. No, the sixth point I will keep to myself for the\r\npresent.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked quickly round the room. \u201cThere is nothing more to be done\r\nhere, I think, unless\u201d\u2014he stared earnestly and long at the dead ashes\r\nin the grate. \u201cThe fire burns\u2014and it destroys. But by chance\u2014there\r\nmight be\u2014let us see!\u201d\r\n\r\nDeftly, on hands and knees, he began to sort the ashes from the grate\r\ninto the fender, handling them with the greatest caution. Suddenly, he\r\ngave a faint exclamation.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe forceps, Hastings!\u201d\r\n\r\nI quickly handed them to him, and with skill he extracted a small piece\r\nof half charred paper.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, _mon ami!_\u201d he cried. \u201cWhat do you think of that?\u201d\r\n\r\nI scrutinized the fragment. This is an exact reproduction of it:\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       03\r\n\r\n\r\nI was puzzled. It was unusually thick, quite unlike ordinary notepaper.\r\nSuddenly an idea struck me.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot!\u201d I cried. \u201cThis is a fragment of a will!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked up at him sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are not surprised?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said gravely, \u201cI expected it.\u201d\r\n\r\nI relinquished the piece of paper, and watched him put it away in his\r\ncase, with the same methodical care that he bestowed on everything. My\r\nbrain was in a whirl. What was this complication of a will? Who had\r\ndestroyed it? The person who had left the candle grease on the floor?\r\nObviously. But how had anyone gained admission? All the doors had been\r\nbolted on the inside.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, my friend,\u201d said Poirot briskly, \u201cwe will go. I should like to\r\nask a few questions of the parlourmaid\u2014Dorcas, her name is, is it not?\u201d\r\n\r\nWe passed through Alfred Inglethorp\u2019s room, and Poirot delayed long\r\nenough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it. We\r\nwent out through that door, locking both it and that of Mrs.\r\nInglethorp\u2019s room as before.\r\n\r\nI took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to see,\r\nand went myself in search of Dorcas.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned with her, however, the boudoir was empty.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot,\u201d I cried, \u201cwhere are you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am here, my friend.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe had stepped outside the French window, and was standing, apparently\r\nlost in admiration, before the various shaped flower beds.\r\n\r\n\u201cAdmirable!\u201d he murmured. \u201cAdmirable! What symmetry! Observe that\r\ncrescent; and those diamonds\u2014their neatness rejoices the eye. The\r\nspacing of the plants, also, is perfect. It has been recently done; is\r\nit not so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I believe they were at it yesterday afternoon. But come in\u2014Dorcas\r\nis here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien, eh bien!_ Do not grudge me a moment\u2019s satisfaction of the\r\neye.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but this affair is more important.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal\r\nimportance?\u201d\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders. There was really no arguing with him if he\r\nchose to take that line.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do not agree? But such things have been. Well, we will come in and\r\ninterview the brave Dorcas.\u201d\r\n\r\nDorcas was standing in the boudoir, her hands folded in front of her,\r\nand her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap. She was the\r\nvery model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant.\r\n\r\nIn her attitude towards Poirot, she was inclined to be suspicious, but\r\nhe soon broke down her defences. He drew forward a chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cPray be seated, mademoiselle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have been with your mistress many years, is it not so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTen years, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a long time, and very faithful service. You were much attached\r\nto her, were you not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was a very good mistress to me, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you will not object to answering a few questions. I put them to\r\nyou with Mr. Cavendish\u2019s full approval.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, certainly, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday\r\nafternoon. Your mistress had a quarrel?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. But I don\u2019t know that I ought\u2014\u2014\u201d Dorcas hesitated.\r\n\r\nPoirot looked at her keenly.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy good Dorcas, it is necessary that I should know every detail of\r\nthat quarrel as fully as possible. Do not think that you are betraying\r\nyour mistress\u2019s secrets. Your mistress lies dead, and it is necessary\r\nthat we should know all\u2014if we are to avenge her. Nothing can bring her\r\nback to life, but we do hope, if there has been foul play, to bring the\r\nmurderer to justice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAmen to that,\u201d said Dorcas fiercely. \u201cAnd, naming no names, there\u2019s\r\n_one_ in this house that none of us could ever abide! And an ill day it\r\nwas when first _he_ darkened the threshold.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot waited for her indignation to subside, and then, resuming his\r\nbusiness-like tone, he asked:\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, as to this quarrel? What is the first you heard of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, sir, I happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat time was that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t say exactly, sir, but it wasn\u2019t tea-time by a long way.\r\nPerhaps four o\u2019clock\u2014or it may have been a bit later. Well, sir, as I\r\nsaid, I happened to be passing along, when I heard voices very loud and\r\nangry in here. I didn\u2019t exactly mean to listen, but\u2014well, there it is.\r\nI stopped. The door was shut, but the mistress was speaking very sharp\r\nand clear, and I heard what she said quite plainly. \u2018You have lied to\r\nme, and deceived me,\u2019 she said. I didn\u2019t hear what Mr. Inglethorp\r\nreplied. He spoke a good bit lower than she did\u2014but she answered: \u2018How\r\ndare you? I have kept you and clothed you and fed you! You owe\r\neverything to me! And this is how you repay me! By bringing disgrace\r\nupon our name!\u2019 Again I didn\u2019t hear what he said, but she went on:\r\n\u2018Nothing that you can say will make any difference. I see my duty\r\nclearly. My mind is made up. You need not think that any fear of\r\npublicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.\u2019 Then I\r\nthought I heard them coming out, so I went off quickly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are sure it was Mr. Inglethorp\u2019s voice you heard?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, sir, whose else\u2019s could it be?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what happened next?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLater, I came back to the hall; but it was all quiet. At five o\u2019clock,\r\nMrs. Inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of\r\ntea\u2014nothing to eat\u2014to the boudoir. She was looking dreadful\u2014so white\r\nand upset. \u2018Dorcas,\u2019 she says, \u2018I\u2019ve had a great shock.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m sorry for\r\nthat, m\u2019m,\u2019 I says. \u2018You\u2019ll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea,\r\nm\u2019m.\u2019 She had something in her hand. I don\u2019t know if it was a letter,\r\nor just a piece of paper, but it had writing on it, and she kept\r\nstaring at it, almost as if she couldn\u2019t believe what was written\r\nthere. She whispered to herself, as though she had forgotten I was\r\nthere: \u2018These few words\u2014and everything\u2019s changed.\u2019 And then she says to\r\nme: \u2018Never trust a man, Dorcas, they\u2019re not worth it!\u2019 I hurried off,\r\nand got her a good strong cup of tea, and she thanked me, and said\r\nshe\u2019d feel better when she\u2019d drunk it. \u2018I don\u2019t know what to do,\u2019 she\r\nsays. \u2018Scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing, Dorcas.\r\nI\u2019d rather hush it up if I could.\u2019 Mrs. Cavendish came in just then, so\r\nshe didn\u2019t say any more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe still had the letter, or whatever it was, in her hand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat would she be likely to do with it afterwards?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, sir, I expect she would lock it up in that purple\r\ncase of hers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that where she usually kept important papers?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. She brought it down with her every morning, and took it up\r\nevery night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did she lose the key of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe missed it yesterday at lunch-time, sir, and told me to look\r\ncarefully for it. She was very much put out about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut she had a duplicate key?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nDorcas was looking very curiously at him and, to tell the truth, so was\r\nI. What was all this about a lost key? Poirot smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind, Dorcas, it is my business to know things. Is this the key\r\nthat was lost?\u201d He drew from his pocket the key that he had found in\r\nthe lock of the despatch-case upstairs.\r\n\r\nDorcas\u2019s eyes looked as though they would pop out of her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, sir, right enough. But where did you find it? I looked\r\neverywhere for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was\r\nto-day. Now, to pass to another subject, had your mistress a dark green\r\ndress in her wardrobe?\u201d\r\n\r\nDorcas was rather startled by the unexpected question.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you quite sure?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHas anyone else in the house got a green dress?\u201d\r\n\r\nDorcas reflected.\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Cynthia has a green evening dress.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLight or dark green?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA light green, sir; a sort of chiffon, they call it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that is not what I want. And nobody else has anything green?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir\u2014not that I know of.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot\u2019s face did not betray a trace of whether he was disappointed or\r\notherwise. He merely remarked:\r\n\r\n\u201cGood, we will leave that and pass on. Have you any reason to believe\r\nthat your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot _last_ night, sir, I know she didn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you know so positively?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause the box was empty. She took the last one two days ago, and she\r\ndidn\u2019t have any more made up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are quite sure of that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPositive, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen that is cleared up! By the way, your mistress didn\u2019t ask you to\r\nsign any paper yesterday?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo sign a paper? No, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen Mr. Hastings and Mr. Lawrence came in yesterday evening, they\r\nfound your mistress busy writing letters. I suppose you can give me no\r\nidea to whom these letters were addressed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I couldn\u2019t, sir. I was out in the evening. Perhaps Annie\r\ncould tell you, though she\u2019s a careless girl. Never cleared the\r\ncoffee-cups away last night. That\u2019s what happens when I\u2019m not here to\r\nlook after things.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot lifted his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cSince they have been left, Dorcas, leave them a little longer, I pray\r\nyou. I should like to examine them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat time did you go out last evening?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout six o\u2019clock, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, Dorcas, that is all I have to ask you.\u201d He rose and\r\nstrolled to the window. \u201cI have been admiring these flower beds. How\r\nmany gardeners are employed here, by the way?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly three now, sir. Five, we had, before the war, when it was kept as\r\na gentleman\u2019s place should be. I wish you could have seen it then, sir.\r\nA fair sight it was. But now there\u2019s only old Manning, and young\r\nWilliam, and a new-fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such-like.\r\nAh, these are dreadful times!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe good times will come again, Dorcas. At least, we hope so. Now,\r\nwill you send Annie to me here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. Thank you, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you know that Mrs. Inglethorp took sleeping powders?\u201d I asked,\r\nin lively curiosity, as Dorcas left the room. \u201cAnd about the lost key\r\nand the duplicate?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne thing at a time. As to the sleeping powders, I knew by this.\u201d He\r\nsuddenly produced a small cardboard box, such as chemists use for\r\npowders.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere did you find it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the wash-stand drawer in Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s bedroom. It was Number\r\nSix of my catalogue.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I suppose, as the last powder was taken two days ago, it is not of\r\nmuch importance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cProbably not, but do you notice anything that strikes you as peculiar\r\nabout this box?\u201d\r\n\r\nI examined it closely.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t say that I do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLook at the label.\u201d\r\n\r\nI read the label carefully: \u201c\u2018One powder to be taken at bedtime, if\r\nrequired. Mrs. Inglethorp.\u2019 No, I see nothing unusual.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot the fact that there is no chemist\u2019s name?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cTo be sure, that is odd!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that, without his\r\nprinted name?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t say that I have.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was becoming quite excited, but Poirot damped my ardour by remarking:\r\n\r\n\u201cYet the explanation is quite simple. So do not intrigue yourself, my\r\nfriend.\u201d\r\n\r\nAn audible creaking proclaimed the approach of Annie, so I had no time\r\nto reply.\r\n\r\nAnnie was a fine, strapping girl, and was evidently labouring under\r\nintense excitement, mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the\r\ntragedy.\r\n\r\nPoirot came to the point at once, with a business-like briskness.\r\n\r\n\u201cI sent for you, Annie, because I thought you might be able to tell me\r\nsomething about the letters Mrs. Inglethorp wrote last night. How many\r\nwere there? And can you tell me any of the names and addresses?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnnie considered.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere were four letters, sir. One was to Miss Howard, and one was to\r\nMr. Wells, the lawyer, and the other two I don\u2019t think I remember,\r\nsir\u2014oh, yes, one was to Ross\u2019s, the caterers in Tadminster. The other\r\none, I don\u2019t remember.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThink,\u201d urged Poirot.\r\n\r\nAnnie racked her brains in vain.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, but it\u2019s clean gone. I don\u2019t think I can have noticed\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt does not matter,\u201d said Poirot, not betraying any sign of\r\ndisappointment. \u201cNow I want to ask you about something else. There is a\r\nsaucepan in Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s room with some cocoa in it. Did she have\r\nthat every night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, it was put in her room every evening, and she warmed it up\r\nin the night\u2014whenever she fancied it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat was it? Plain cocoa?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, made with milk, with a teaspoonful of sugar, and two\r\nteaspoonfuls of rum in it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho took it to her room?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlways?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt what time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I went to draw the curtains, as a rule, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you bring it straight up from the kitchen then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, you see there\u2019s not much room on the gas stove, so cook used\r\nto make it early, before putting the vegetables on for supper. Then I\r\nused to bring it up, and put it on the table by the swing door, and\r\ntake it into her room later.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe swing door is in the left wing, is it not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the table, is it on this side of the door, or on the\r\nfarther\u2014servants\u2019 side?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s this side, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat time did you bring it up last night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout quarter-past seven, I should say, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd when did you take it into Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s room?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I went to shut up, sir. About eight o\u2019clock. Mrs. Inglethorp came\r\nup to bed before I\u2019d finished.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, between seven-fifteen and eight o\u2019clock, the cocoa was standing\r\non the table in the left wing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Annie had been growing redder and redder in the face, and\r\nnow she blurted out unexpectedly:\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd if there _was_ salt in it, sir, it wasn\u2019t me. I never took the\r\nsalt near it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat makes you think there was salt in it?\u201d asked Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cSeeing it on the tray, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou saw some salt on the tray?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Coarse kitchen salt, it looked. I never noticed it when I took\r\nthe tray up, but when I came to take it into the mistress\u2019s room I saw\r\nit at once, and I suppose I ought to have taken it down again, and\r\nasked cook to make some fresh. But I was in a hurry, because Dorcas was\r\nout, and I thought maybe the cocoa itself was all right, and the salt\r\nhad only gone on the tray. So I dusted it off with my apron, and took\r\nit in.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement. Unknown to\r\nherself, Annie had provided us with an important piece of evidence. How\r\nshe would have gaped if she had realized that her \u201ccoarse kitchen salt\u201d\r\nwas strychnine, one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind. I\r\nmarvelled at Poirot\u2019s calm. His self-control was astonishing. I awaited\r\nhis next question with impatience, but it disappointed me.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you went into Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s room, was the door leading into\r\nMiss Cynthia\u2019s room bolted?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! Yes, sir; it always was. It had never been opened.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the door into Mr. Inglethorp\u2019s room? Did you notice if that was\r\nbolted too?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnnie hesitated.\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t rightly say, sir; it was shut but I couldn\u2019t say whether it\r\nwas bolted or not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you finally left the room, did Mrs. Inglethorp bolt the door\r\nafter you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, not then, but I expect she did later. She usually did lock it\r\nat night. The door into the passage, that is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you notice any candle grease on the floor when you did the room\r\nyesterday?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCandle grease? Oh, no, sir. Mrs. Inglethorp didn\u2019t have a candle, only\r\na reading-lamp.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor,\r\nyou think you would have been sure to have seen it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, and I would have taken it out with a piece of blotting-paper\r\nand a hot iron.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen Poirot repeated the question he had put to Dorcas:\r\n\r\n\u201cDid your mistress ever have a green dress?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor a mantle, nor a cape, nor a\u2014how do you call it?\u2014a sports coat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot green, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor anyone else in the house?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnnie reflected.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are sure of that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Bien!_ That is all I want to know. Thank you very much.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a nervous giggle, Annie took herself creakingly out of the room.\r\nMy pent-up excitement burst forth.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot,\u201d I cried, \u201cI congratulate you! This is a great discovery.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is a great discovery?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, that it was the cocoa and not the coffee that was poisoned. That\r\nexplains everything! Of course it did not take effect until the early\r\nmorning, since the cocoa was only drunk in the middle of the night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you think that the cocoa\u2014mark well what I say, Hastings, the\r\n_cocoa_\u2014contained strychnine?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course! That salt on the tray, what else could it have been?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt might have been salt,\u201d replied Poirot placidly.\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders. If he was going to take the matter that way,\r\nit was no good arguing with him. The idea crossed my mind, not for the\r\nfirst time, that poor old Poirot was growing old. Privately I thought\r\nit lucky that he had associated with him someone of a more receptive\r\ntype of mind.\r\n\r\nPoirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are not pleased with me, _mon ami?_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Poirot,\u201d I said coldly, \u201cit is not for me to dictate to you.\r\nYou have a right to your own opinion, just as I have to mine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA most admirable sentiment,\u201d remarked Poirot, rising briskly to his\r\nfeet. \u201cNow I have finished with this room. By the way, whose is the\r\nsmaller desk in the corner?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Inglethorp\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d He tried the roll top tentatively. \u201cLocked. But perhaps one of\r\nMrs. Inglethorp\u2019s keys would open it.\u201d He tried several, twisting and\r\nturning them with a practiced hand, and finally uttering an ejaculation\r\nof satisfaction. \u201c_Voil\u00e0!_ It is not the key, but it will open it at a\r\npinch.\u201d He slid back the roll top, and ran a rapid eye over the neatly\r\nfiled papers. To my surprise, he did not examine them, merely remarking\r\napprovingly as he relocked the desk: \u201cDecidedly, he is a man of method,\r\nthis Mr. Inglethorp!\u201d\r\n\r\nA \u201cman of method\u201d was, in Poirot\u2019s estimation, the highest praise that\r\ncould be bestowed on any individual.\r\n\r\nI felt that my friend was not what he had been as he rambled on\r\ndisconnectedly:\r\n\r\n\u201cThere were no stamps in his desk, but there might have been, eh, _mon\r\nami?_ There might have been? Yes\u201d\u2014his eyes wandered round the\r\nroom\u2014\u201cthis boudoir has nothing more to tell us. It did not yield much.\r\nOnly this.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe pulled a crumpled envelope out of his pocket, and tossed it over to\r\nme. It was rather a curious document. A plain, dirty looking old\r\nenvelope with a few words scrawled across it, apparently at random. The\r\nfollowing is a facsimile of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       04\r\n\n\u201cWhere did you find this?\u201d I asked Poirot, in lively curiosity.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the waste-paper basket. You recognise the handwriting?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it is Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s. But what does it mean?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot say\u2014but it is suggestive.\u201d\r\n\r\nA wild idea flashed across me. Was it possible that Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s\r\nmind was deranged? Had she some fantastic idea of demoniacal\r\npossession? And, if that were so, was it not also possible that she\r\nmight have taken her own life?\r\n\r\nI was about to expound these theories to Poirot, when his own words\r\ndistracted me.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d he said, \u201cnow to examine the coffee-cups!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Poirot! What on earth is the good of that, now that we know\r\nabout the cocoa?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, _l\u00e0 l\u00e0!_ That miserable cocoa!\u201d cried Poirot flippantly.\r\n\r\nHe laughed with apparent enjoyment, raising his arms to heaven in mock\r\ndespair, in what I could not but consider the worst possible taste.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd, anyway,\u201d I said, with increasing coldness, \u201cas Mrs. Inglethorp\r\ntook her coffee upstairs with her, I do not see what you expect to\r\nfind, unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of\r\nstrychnine on the coffee tray!\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot was sobered at once.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, come, my friend,\u201d he said, slipping his arms through mine. \u201c_Ne\r\nvous f\u00e2chez pas!_ Allow me to interest myself in my coffee-cups, and I\r\nwill respect your cocoa. There! Is it a bargain?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was so quaintly humorous that I was forced to laugh; and we went\r\ntogether to the drawing-room, where the coffee-cups and tray remained\r\nundisturbed as we had left them.\r\n\r\nPoirot made me recapitulate the scene of the night before, listening\r\nvery carefully, and verifying the position of the various cups.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo Mrs. Cavendish stood by the tray\u2014and poured out. Yes. Then she came\r\nacross to the window where you sat with Mademoiselle Cynthia. Yes. Here\r\nare the three cups. And the cup on the mantelpiece, half drunk, that\r\nwould be Mr. Lawrence Cavendish\u2019s. And the one on the tray?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJohn Cavendish\u2019s. I saw him put it down there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood. One, two, three, four, five\u2014but where, then, is the cup of Mr.\r\nInglethorp?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe does not take coffee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen all are accounted for. One moment, my friend.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith infinite care, he took a drop or two from the grounds in each cup,\r\nsealing them up in separate test tubes, tasting each in turn as he did\r\nso. His physiognomy underwent a curious change. An expression gathered\r\nthere that I can only describe as half puzzled, and half relieved.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Bien!_\u201d he said at last. \u201cIt is evident! I had an idea\u2014but clearly I\r\nwas mistaken. Yes, altogether I was mistaken. Yet it is strange. But no\r\nmatter!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd, with a characteristic shrug, he dismissed whatever it was that was\r\nworrying him from his mind. I could have told him from the beginning\r\nthat this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind\r\nalley, but I restrained my tongue. After all, though he was old, Poirot\r\nhad been a great man in his day.\r\n\r\n\u201cBreakfast is ready,\u201d said John Cavendish, coming in from the hall.\r\n\u201cYou will breakfast with us, Monsieur Poirot?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot acquiesced. I observed John. Already he was almost restored to\r\nhis normal self. The shock of the events of the last night had upset\r\nhim temporarily, but his equable poise soon swung back to the normal.\r\nHe was a man of very little imagination, in sharp contrast with his\r\nbrother, who had, perhaps, too much.\r\n\r\nEver since the early hours of the morning, John had been hard at work,\r\nsending telegrams\u2014one of the first had gone to Evelyn Howard\u2014writing\r\nnotices for the papers, and generally occupying himself with the\r\nmelancholy duties that a death entails.\r\n\r\n\u201cMay I ask how things are proceeding?\u201d he said. \u201cDo your investigations\r\npoint to my mother having died a natural death\u2014or\u2014or must we prepare\r\nourselves for the worst?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think, Mr. Cavendish,\u201d said Poirot gravely, \u201cthat you would do well\r\nnot to buoy yourself up with any false hopes. Can you tell me the views\r\nof the other members of the family?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy brother Lawrence is convinced that we are making a fuss over\r\nnothing. He says that everything points to its being a simple case of\r\nheart failure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe does, does he? That is very interesting\u2014very interesting,\u201d murmured\r\nPoirot softly. \u201cAnd Mrs. Cavendish?\u201d\r\n\r\nA faint cloud passed over John\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have not the least idea what my wife\u2019s views on the subject are.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe answer brought a momentary stiffness in its train. John broke the\r\nrather awkward silence by saying with a slight effort:\r\n\r\n\u201cI told you, didn\u2019t I, that Mr. Inglethorp has returned?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot bent his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s an awkward position for all of us. Of course one has to treat him\r\nas usual\u2014but, hang it all, one\u2019s gorge does rise at sitting down to eat\r\nwith a possible murderer!\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\u201cI quite understand. It is a very difficult situation for you, Mr.\r\nCavendish. I would like to ask you one question. Mr. Inglethorp\u2019s\r\nreason for not returning last night was, I believe, that he had\r\nforgotten the latch-key. Is not that so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose you are quite sure that the latch-key _was_ forgotten\u2014that\r\nhe did not take it after all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no idea. I never thought of looking. We always keep it in the\r\nhall drawer. I\u2019ll go and see if it\u2019s there now.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot held up his hand with a faint smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, Mr. Cavendish, it is too late now. I am certain that you would\r\nfind it. If Mr. Inglethorp did take it, he has had ample time to\r\nreplace it by now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut do you think\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think nothing. If anyone had chanced to look this morning before his\r\nreturn, and seen it there, it would have been a valuable point in his\r\nfavour. That is all.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn looked perplexed.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not worry,\u201d said Poirot smoothly. \u201cI assure you that you need not\r\nlet it trouble you. Since you are so kind, let us go and have some\r\nbreakfast.\u201d\r\n\r\nEveryone was assembled in the dining-room. Under the circumstances, we\r\nwere naturally not a cheerful party. The reaction after a shock is\r\nalways trying, and I think we were all suffering from it. Decorum and\r\ngood breeding naturally enjoined that our demeanour should be much as\r\nusual, yet I could not help wondering if this self-control were really\r\na matter of great difficulty. There were no red eyes, no signs of\r\nsecretly indulged grief. I felt that I was right in my opinion that\r\nDorcas was the person most affected by the personal side of the\r\ntragedy.\r\n\r\nI pass over Alfred Inglethorp, who acted the bereaved widower in a\r\nmanner that I felt to be disgusting in its hypocrisy. Did he know that\r\nwe suspected him, I wondered. Surely he could not be unaware of the\r\nfact, conceal it as we would. Did he feel some secret stirring of fear,\r\nor was he confident that his crime would go unpunished? Surely the\r\nsuspicion in the atmosphere must warn him that he was already a marked\r\nman.\r\n\r\nBut did everyone suspect him? What about Mrs. Cavendish? I watched her\r\nas she sat at the head of the table, graceful, composed, enigmatic. In\r\nher soft grey frock, with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her\r\nslender hands, she looked very beautiful. When she chose, however, her\r\nface could be sphinx-like in its inscrutability. She was very silent,\r\nhardly opening her lips, and yet in some queer way I felt that the\r\ngreat strength of her personality was dominating us all.\r\n\r\nAnd little Cynthia? Did she suspect? She looked very tired and ill, I\r\nthought. The heaviness and languor of her manner were very marked. I\r\nasked her if she were feeling ill, and she answered frankly:\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve got the most beastly headache.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave another cup of coffee, mademoiselle?\u201d said Poirot solicitously.\r\n\u201cIt will revive you. It is unparalleled for the _mal de t\u00eate_.\u201d He\r\njumped up and took her cup.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo sugar,\u201d said Cynthia, watching him, as he picked up the\r\nsugar-tongs.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo sugar? You abandon it in the war-time, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I never take it in coffee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Sacr\u00e9!_\u201d murmured Poirot to himself, as he brought back the\r\nreplenished cup.\r\n\r\nOnly I heard him, and glancing up curiously at the little man I saw\r\nthat his face was working with suppressed excitement, and his eyes were\r\nas green as a cat\u2019s. He had heard or seen something that had affected\r\nhim strongly\u2014but what was it? I do not usually label myself as dense,\r\nbut I must confess that nothing out of the ordinary had attracted _my_\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nIn another moment, the door opened and Dorcas appeared.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Wells to see you, sir,\u201d she said to John.\r\n\r\nI remembered the name as being that of the lawyer to whom Mrs.\r\nInglethorp had written the night before.\r\n\r\nJohn rose immediately.\r\n\r\n\u201cShow him into my study.\u201d Then he turned to us. \u201cMy mother\u2019s lawyer,\u201d\r\nhe explained. And in a lower voice: \u201cHe is also Coroner\u2014you understand.\r\nPerhaps you would like to come with me?\u201d\r\n\r\nWe acquiesced and followed him out of the room. John strode on ahead\r\nand I took the opportunity of whispering to Poirot:\r\n\r\n\u201cThere will be an inquest then?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded absently. He seemed absorbed in thought; so much so that\r\nmy curiosity was aroused.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it? You are not attending to what I say.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is true, my friend. I am much worried.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause Mademoiselle Cynthia does not take sugar in her coffee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat? You cannot be serious?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I am most serious. Ah, there is something there that I do not\r\nunderstand. My instinct was right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat instinct?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffee-cups.\r\n_Chut!_ no more now!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe followed John into his study, and he closed the door behind us.\r\n\r\nMr. Wells was a pleasant man of middle-age, with keen eyes, and the\r\ntypical lawyer\u2019s mouth. John introduced us both, and explained the\r\nreason of our presence.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will understand, Wells,\u201d he added, \u201cthat this is all strictly\r\nprivate. We are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for\r\ninvestigation of any kind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so, quite so,\u201d said Mr. Wells soothingly. \u201cI wish we could have\r\nspared you the pain and publicity of an inquest, but of course it\u2019s\r\nquite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor\u2019s certificate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I suppose so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cClever man, Bauerstein. Great authority on toxicology, I believe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said John with a certain stiffness in his manner. Then he\r\nadded rather hesitatingly: \u201cShall we have to appear as witnesses\u2014all of\r\nus, I mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou, of course\u2014and ah\u2014er\u2014Mr.\u2014er\u2014Inglethorp.\u201d\r\n\r\nA slight pause ensued before the lawyer went on in his soothing manner:\r\n\r\n\u201cAny other evidence will be simply confirmatory, a mere matter of\r\nform.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d\r\n\r\nA faint expression of relief swept over John\u2019s face. It puzzled me, for\r\nI saw no occasion for it.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you know of nothing to the contrary,\u201d pursued Mr. Wells, \u201cI had\r\nthought of Friday. That will give us plenty of time for the doctor\u2019s\r\nreport. The post-mortem is to take place to-night, I believe?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen that arrangement will suit you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerfectly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI need not tell you, my dear Cavendish, how distressed I am at this\r\nmost tragic affair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you give us no help in solving it, monsieur?\u201d interposed Poirot,\r\nspeaking for the first time since we had entered the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cI?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, we heard that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote to you last night. You should\r\nhave received the letter this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did, but it contains no information. It is merely a note asking me\r\nto call upon her this morning, as she wanted my advice on a matter of\r\ngreat importance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe gave you no hint as to what that matter might be?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, no.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a pity,\u201d said John.\r\n\r\n\u201cA great pity,\u201d agreed Poirot gravely.\r\n\r\nThere was silence. Poirot remained lost in thought for a few minutes.\r\nFinally he turned to the lawyer again.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Wells, there is one thing I should like to ask you\u2014that is, if it\r\nis not against professional etiquette. In the event of Mrs.\r\nInglethorp\u2019s death, who would inherit her money?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe lawyer hesitated a moment, and then replied:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe knowledge will be public property very soon, so if Mr. Cavendish\r\ndoes not object\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d interpolated John.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not see any reason why I should not answer your question. By her\r\nlast will, dated August of last year, after various unimportant\r\nlegacies to servants, etc., she gave her entire fortune to her stepson,\r\nMr. John Cavendish.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas not that\u2014pardon the question, Mr. Cavendish\u2014rather unfair to her\r\nother stepson, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I do not think so. You see, under the terms of their father\u2019s\r\nwill, while John inherited the property, Lawrence, at his stepmother\u2019s\r\ndeath, would come into a considerable sum of money. Mrs. Inglethorp\r\nleft her money to her elder stepson, knowing that he would have to keep\r\nup Styles. It was, to my mind, a very fair and equitable distribution.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cI see. But I am right in saying, am I not, that by your English law\r\nthat will was automatically revoked when Mrs. Inglethorp remarried?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Wells bowed his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I was about to proceed, Monsieur Poirot, that document is now null\r\nand void.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Hein!_\u201d said Poirot. He reflected for a moment, and then asked: \u201cWas\r\nMrs. Inglethorp herself aware of that fact?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know. She may have been.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was,\u201d said John unexpectedly. \u201cWe were discussing the matter of\r\nwills being revoked by marriage only yesterday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! One more question, Mr. Wells. You say \u2018her last will.\u2019 Had Mrs.\r\nInglethorp, then, made several former wills?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn an average, she made a new will at least once a year,\u201d said Mr.\r\nWells imperturbably. \u201cShe was given to changing her mind as to her\r\ntestamentary dispositions, now benefiting one, now another member of\r\nher family.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuppose,\u201d suggested Poirot, \u201cthat, unknown to you, she had made a new\r\nwill in favour of someone who was not, in any sense of the word, a\r\nmember of the family\u2014we will say Miss Howard, for instance\u2014would you be\r\nsurprised?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot in the least.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d Poirot seemed to have exhausted his questions.\r\n\r\nI drew close to him, while John and the lawyer were debating the\r\nquestion of going through Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s papers.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you think Mrs. Inglethorp made a will leaving all her money to Miss\r\nHoward?\u201d I asked in a low voice, with some curiosity.\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen why did you ask?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn Cavendish had turned to Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you come with us, Monsieur Poirot? We are going through my\r\nmother\u2019s papers. Mr. Inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely\r\nto Mr. Wells and myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich simplifies matters very much,\u201d murmured the lawyer. \u201cAs\r\ntechnically, of course, he was entitled\u2014\u2014\u201d He did not finish the\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will look through the desk in the boudoir first,\u201d explained John,\r\n\u201cand go up to her bedroom afterwards. She kept her most important\r\npapers in a purple despatch-case, which we must look through\r\ncarefully.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the lawyer, \u201cit is quite possible that there may be a later\r\nwill than the one in my possession.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere _is_ a later will.\u201d It was Poirot who spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d John and the lawyer looked at him startled.\r\n\r\n\u201cOr, rather,\u201d pursued my friend imperturbably, \u201cthere _was_ one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u2014there was one? Where is it now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBurnt!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBurnt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. See here.\u201d He took out the charred fragment we had found in the\r\ngrate in Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s room, and handed it to the lawyer with a\r\nbrief explanation of when and where he had found it.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut possibly this is an old will?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not think so. In fact I am almost certain that it was made no\r\nearlier than yesterday afternoon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cImpossible!\u201d broke simultaneously from both men.\r\n\r\nPoirot turned to John.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you will allow me to send for your gardener, I will prove it to\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, of course\u2014but I don\u2019t see\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot raised his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo as I ask you. Afterwards you shall question as much as you please.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d He rang the bell.\r\n\r\nDorcas answered it in due course.\r\n\r\n\u201cDorcas, will you tell Manning to come round and speak to me here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nDorcas withdrew.\r\n\r\nWe waited in a tense silence. Poirot alone seemed perfectly at his\r\nease, and dusted a forgotten corner of the bookcase.\r\n\r\nThe clumping of hobnailed boots on the gravel outside proclaimed the\r\napproach of Manning. John looked questioningly at Poirot. The latter\r\nnodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome inside, Manning,\u201d said John, \u201cI want to speak to you.\u201d\r\n\r\nManning came slowly and hesitatingly through the French window, and\r\nstood as near it as he could. He held his cap in his hands, twisting it\r\nvery carefully round and round. His back was much bent, though he was\r\nprobably not as old as he looked, but his eyes were sharp and\r\nintelligent, and belied his slow and rather cautious speech.\r\n\r\n\u201cManning,\u201d said John, \u201cthis gentleman will put some questions to you\r\nwhich I want you to answer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYessir,\u201d mumbled Manning.\r\n\r\nPoirot stepped forward briskly. Manning\u2019s eye swept over him with a\r\nfaint contempt.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were planting a bed of begonias round by the south side of the\r\nhouse yesterday afternoon, were you not, Manning?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, me and Willum.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Mrs. Inglethorp came to the window and called you, did she not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, she did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me in your own words exactly what happened after that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, sir, nothing much. She just told Willum to go on his bicycle\r\ndown to the village, and bring back a form of will, or such-like\u2014I\r\ndon\u2019t know what exactly\u2014she wrote it down for him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, he did, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what happened next?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe went on with the begonias, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid not Mrs. Inglethorp call you again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, both me and Willum, she called.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe made us come right in, and sign our names at the bottom of a long\r\npaper\u2014under where she\u2019d signed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you see anything of what was written above her signature?\u201d asked\r\nPoirot sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, there was a bit of blotting paper over that part.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you signed where she told you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, first me and then Willum.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did she do with it afterwards?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, sir, she slipped it into a long envelope, and put it inside a\r\nsort of purple box that was standing on the desk.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat time was it when she first called you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout four, I should say, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot earlier? Couldn\u2019t it have been about half-past three?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I shouldn\u2019t say so, sir. It would be more likely to be a bit after\r\nfour\u2014not before it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, Manning, that will do,\u201d said Poirot pleasantly.\r\n\r\nThe gardener glanced at his master, who nodded, whereupon Manning\r\nlifted a finger to his forehead with a low mumble, and backed\r\ncautiously out of the window.\r\n\r\nWe all looked at each other.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d murmured John. \u201cWhat an extraordinary coincidence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow\u2014a coincidence?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat my mother should have made a will on the very day of her death!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Wells cleared his throat and remarked drily:\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you so sure it is a coincidence, Cavendish?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour mother, you tell me, had a violent quarrel with\u2014someone yesterday\r\nafternoon\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d cried John again. There was a tremor in his voice,\r\nand he had gone very pale.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly and\r\nhurriedly makes a new will. The contents of that will we shall never\r\nknow. She told no one of its provisions. This morning, no doubt, she\r\nwould have consulted me on the subject\u2014but she had no chance. The will\r\ndisappears, and she takes its secret with her to her grave. Cavendish,\r\nI much fear there is no coincidence there. Monsieur Poirot, I am sure\r\nyou agree with me that the facts are very suggestive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuggestive, or not,\u201d interrupted John, \u201cwe are most grateful to\r\nMonsieur Poirot for elucidating the matter. But for him, we should\r\nnever have known of this will. I suppose, I may not ask you, monsieur,\r\nwhat first led you to suspect the fact?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled and answered:\r\n\r\n\u201cA scribbled over old envelope, and a freshly planted bed of begonias.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn, I think, would have pressed his questions further, but at that\r\nmoment the loud purr of a motor was audible, and we all turned to the\r\nwindow as it swept past.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvie!\u201d cried John. \u201cExcuse me, Wells.\u201d He went hurriedly out into the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nPoirot looked inquiringly at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Howard,\u201d I explained.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, I am glad she has come. There is a woman with a head and a heart\r\ntoo, Hastings. Though the good God gave her no beauty!\u201d\r\n\r\nI followed John\u2019s example, and went out into the hall, where Miss\r\nHoward was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass\r\nof veils that enveloped her head. As her eyes fell on me, a sudden pang\r\nof guilt shot through me. This was the woman who had warned me so\r\nearnestly, and to whose warning I had, alas, paid no heed! How soon,\r\nand how contemptuously, I had dismissed it from my mind. Now that she\r\nhad been proved justified in so tragic a manner, I felt ashamed. She\r\nhad known Alfred Inglethorp only too well. I wondered whether, if she\r\nhad remained at Styles, the tragedy would have taken place, or would\r\nthe man have feared her watchful eyes?\r\n\r\nI was relieved when she shook me by the hand, with her well remembered\r\npainful grip. The eyes that met mine were sad, but not reproachful;\r\nthat she had been crying bitterly, I could tell by the redness of her\r\neyelids, but her manner was unchanged from its old gruffness.\r\n\r\n\u201cStarted the moment I got the wire. Just come off night duty. Hired\r\ncar. Quickest way to get here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you had anything to eat this morning, Evie?\u201d asked John.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought not. Come along, breakfast\u2019s not cleared away yet, and\r\nthey\u2019ll make you some fresh tea.\u201d He turned to me. \u201cLook after her,\r\nHastings, will you? Wells is waiting for me. Oh, here\u2019s Monsieur\r\nPoirot. He\u2019s helping us, you know, Evie.\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Howard shook hands with Poirot, but glanced suspiciously over her\r\nshoulder at John.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u2014helping us?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHelping us to investigate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing to investigate. Have they taken him to prison yet?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTaken who to prison?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho? Alfred Inglethorp, of course!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Evie, do be careful. Lawrence is of the opinion that my mother\r\ndied from heart seizure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMore fool, Lawrence!\u201d retorted Miss Howard. \u201cOf course Alfred\r\nInglethorp murdered poor Emily\u2014as I always told you he would.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Evie, don\u2019t shout so. Whatever we may think or suspect, it is\r\nbetter to say as little as possible for the present. The inquest isn\u2019t\r\nuntil Friday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot until fiddlesticks!\u201d The snort Miss Howard gave was truly\r\nmagnificent. \u201cYou\u2019re all off your heads. The man will be out of the\r\ncountry by then. If he\u2019s any sense, he won\u2019t stay here tamely and wait\r\nto be hanged.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn Cavendish looked at her helplessly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know what it is,\u201d she accused him, \u201cyou\u2019ve been listening to the\r\ndoctors. Never should. What do they know? Nothing at all\u2014or just enough\r\nto make them dangerous. I ought to know\u2014my own father was a doctor.\r\nThat little Wilkins is about the greatest fool that even I have ever\r\nseen. Heart seizure! Sort of thing he would say. Anyone with any sense\r\ncould see at once that her husband had poisoned her. I always said he\u2019d\r\nmurder her in her bed, poor soul. Now he\u2019s done it. And all you can do\r\nis to murmur silly things about \u2018heart seizure\u2019 and \u2018inquest on\r\nFriday.\u2019 You ought to be ashamed of yourself, John Cavendish.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d asked John, unable to help a faint smile.\r\n\u201cDash it all, Evie, I can\u2019t haul him down to the local police station\r\nby the scruff of his neck.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you might do something. Find out how he did it. He\u2019s a crafty\r\nbeggar. Dare say he soaked fly papers. Ask cook if she\u2019s missed any.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me very forcibly at that moment that to harbour Miss\r\nHoward and Alfred Inglethorp under the same roof, and keep the peace\r\nbetween them, was likely to prove a Herculean task, and I did not envy\r\nJohn. I could see by the expression of his face that he fully\r\nappreciated the difficulty of the position. For the moment, he sought\r\nrefuge in retreat, and left the room precipitately.\r\n\r\nDorcas brought in fresh tea. As she left the room, Poirot came over\r\nfrom the window where he had been standing, and sat down facing Miss\r\nHoward.\r\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d he said gravely, \u201cI want to ask you something.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAsk away,\u201d said the lady, eyeing him with some disfavour.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to be able to count upon your help.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you to hang Alfred with pleasure,\u201d she replied gruffly.\r\n\u201cHanging\u2019s too good for him. Ought to be drawn and quartered, like in\r\ngood old times.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are at one then,\u201d said Poirot, \u201cfor I, too, want to hang the\r\ncriminal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlfred Inglethorp?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHim, or another.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo question of another. Poor Emily was never murdered until _he_ came\r\nalong. I don\u2019t say she wasn\u2019t surrounded by sharks\u2014she was. But it was\r\nonly her purse they were after. Her life was safe enough. But along\r\ncomes Mr. Alfred Inglethorp\u2014and within two months\u2014hey presto!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBelieve me, Miss Howard,\u201d said Poirot very earnestly, \u201cif Mr.\r\nInglethorp is the man, he shall not escape me. On my honour, I will\r\nhang him as high as Haman!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d said Miss Howard more enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I must ask you to trust me. Now your help may be very valuable to\r\nme. I will tell you why. Because, in all this house of mourning, yours\r\nare the only eyes that have wept.\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Howard blinked, and a new note crept into the gruffness of her\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you mean that I was fond of her\u2014yes, I was. You know, Emily was a\r\nselfish old woman in her way. She was very generous, but she always\r\nwanted a return. She never let people forget what she had done for\r\nthem\u2014and, that way she missed love. Don\u2019t think she ever realized it,\r\nthough, or felt the lack of it. Hope not, anyway. I was on a different\r\nfooting. I took my stand from the first. \u2018So many pounds a year I\u2019m\r\nworth to you. Well and good. But not a penny piece besides\u2014not a pair\r\nof gloves, nor a theatre ticket.\u2019 She didn\u2019t understand\u2014was very\r\noffended sometimes. Said I was foolishly proud. It wasn\u2019t that\u2014but I\r\ncouldn\u2019t explain. Anyway, I kept my self-respect. And so, out of the\r\nwhole bunch, I was the only one who could allow myself to be fond of\r\nher. I watched over her. I guarded her from the lot of them, and then a\r\nglib-tongued scoundrel comes along, and pooh! all my years of devotion\r\ngo for nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\u201cI understand, mademoiselle, I understand all you feel. It is most\r\nnatural. You think that we are lukewarm\u2014that we lack fire and\r\nenergy\u2014but trust me, it is not so.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn stuck his head in at this juncture, and invited us both to come up\r\nto Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s room, as he and Mr. Wells had finished looking\r\nthrough the desk in the boudoir.\r\n\r\nAs we went up the stairs, John looked back to the dining-room door, and\r\nlowered his voice confidentially:\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here, what\u2019s going to happen when these two meet?\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head helplessly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve told Mary to keep them apart if she can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill she be able to do so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Lord only knows. There\u2019s one thing, Inglethorp himself won\u2019t be\r\ntoo keen on meeting her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the keys still, haven\u2019t you, Poirot?\u201d I asked, as we\r\nreached the door of the locked room.\r\n\r\nTaking the keys from Poirot, John unlocked it, and we all passed in.\r\nThe lawyer went straight to the desk, and John followed him.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy mother kept most of her important papers in this despatch-case, I\r\nbelieve,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nPoirot drew out the small bunch of keys.\r\n\r\n\u201cPermit me. I locked it, out of precaution, this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not locked now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cImpossible!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSee.\u201d And John lifted the lid as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Milles tonnerres!_\u201d cried Poirot, dumbfounded. \u201cAnd I\u2014who have both\r\nthe keys in my pocket!\u201d He flung himself upon the case. Suddenly he\r\nstiffened. \u201c_Eh voil\u00e0 une affaire!_ This lock has been forced.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot laid down the case again.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut who forced it? Why should they? When? But the door was locked?\u201d\r\nThese exclamations burst from us disjointedly.\r\n\r\nPoirot answered them categorically\u2014almost mechanically.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho? That is the question. Why? Ah, if I only knew. When? Since I was\r\nhere an hour ago. As to the door being locked, it is a very ordinary\r\nlock. Probably any other of the doorkeys in this passage would fit it.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe stared at one another blankly. Poirot had walked over to the\r\nmantelpiece. He was outwardly calm, but I noticed his hands, which from\r\nlong force of habit were mechanically straightening the spill vases on\r\nthe mantelpiece, were shaking violently.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee here, it was like this,\u201d he said at last. \u201cThere was something in\r\nthat case\u2014some piece of evidence, slight in itself perhaps, but still\r\nenough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime. It was vital\r\nto him that it should be destroyed before it was discovered and its\r\nsignificance appreciated. Therefore, he took the risk, the great risk,\r\nof coming in here. Finding the case locked, he was obliged to force it,\r\nthus betraying his presence. For him to take that risk, it must have\r\nbeen something of great importance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what was it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d cried Poirot, with a gesture of anger. \u201cThat, I do not know! A\r\ndocument of some kind, without doubt, possibly the scrap of paper\r\nDorcas saw in her hand yesterday afternoon. And I\u2014\u201d his anger burst\r\nforth freely\u2014\u201cmiserable animal that I am! I guessed nothing! I have\r\nbehaved like an imbecile! I should never have left that case here. I\r\nshould have carried it away with me. Ah, triple pig! And now it is\r\ngone. It is destroyed\u2014but is it destroyed? Is there not yet a chance\u2014we\r\nmust leave no stone unturned\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nHe rushed like a madman from the room, and I followed him as soon as I\r\nhad sufficiently recovered my wits. But, by the time I had reached the\r\ntop of the stairs, he was out of sight.\r\n\r\nMary Cavendish was standing where the staircase branched, staring down\r\ninto the hall in the direction in which he had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat has happened to your extraordinary little friend, Mr. Hastings?\r\nHe has just rushed past me like a mad bull.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s rather upset about something,\u201d I remarked feebly. I really did\r\nnot know how much Poirot would wish me to disclose. As I saw a faint\r\nsmile gather on Mrs. Cavendish\u2019s expressive mouth, I endeavoured to try\r\nand turn the conversation by saying: \u201cThey haven\u2019t met yet, have they?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Inglethorp and Miss Howard.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe looked at me in rather a disconcerting manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you think it would be such a disaster if they did meet?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t you?\u201d I said, rather taken aback.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d She was smiling in her quiet way. \u201cI should like to see a good\r\nflare up. It would clear the air. At present we are all thinking so\r\nmuch, and saying so little.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJohn doesn\u2019t think so,\u201d I remarked. \u201cHe\u2019s anxious to keep them apart.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, John!\u201d\r\n\r\nSomething in her tone fired me, and I blurted out:\r\n\r\n\u201cOld John\u2019s an awfully good sort.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe studied me curiously for a minute or two, and then said, to my\r\ngreat surprise:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are loyal to your friend. I like you for that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you my friend too?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am a very bad friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause it is true. I am charming to my friends one day, and forget\r\nall about them the next.\u201d\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know what impelled me, but I was nettled, and I said foolishly\r\nand not in the best of taste:\r\n\r\n\u201cYet you seem to be invariably charming to Dr. Bauerstein!\u201d\r\n\r\nInstantly I regretted my words. Her face stiffened. I had the\r\nimpression of a steel curtain coming down and blotting out the real\r\nwoman. Without a word, she turned and went swiftly up the stairs,\r\nwhilst I stood like an idiot gaping after her.\r\n\r\nI was recalled to other matters by a frightful row going on below. I\r\ncould hear Poirot shouting and expounding. I was vexed to think that my\r\ndiplomacy had been in vain. The little man appeared to be taking the\r\nwhole house into his confidence, a proceeding of which I, for one,\r\ndoubted the wisdom. Once again I could not help regretting that my\r\nfriend was so prone to lose his head in moments of excitement. I\r\nstepped briskly down the stairs. The sight of me calmed Poirot almost\r\nimmediately. I drew him aside.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d I said, \u201cis this wise? Surely you don\u2019t want the\r\nwhole house to know of this occurrence? You are actually playing into\r\nthe criminal\u2019s hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think so, Hastings?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well, my friend, I will be guided by you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood. Although, unfortunately, it is a little too late now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked so crestfallen and abashed that I felt quite sorry, though I\r\nstill thought my rebuke a just and wise one.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said at last, \u201clet us go, _mon ami_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have finished here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor the moment, yes. You will walk back with me to the village?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWillingly.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe picked up his little suit-case, and we went out through the open\r\nwindow in the drawing-room. Cynthia Murdoch was just coming in, and\r\nPoirot stood aside to let her pass.\r\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me, mademoiselle, one minute.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d she turned inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you ever make up Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s medicines?\u201d\r\n\r\nA slight flush rose in her face, as she answered rather constrainedly:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly her powders?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe flush deepened as Cynthia replied:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, I did make up some sleeping powders for her once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThese?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot produced the empty box which had contained powders.\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you tell me what they were? Sulphonal? Veronal?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, they were bromide powders.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! Thank you, mademoiselle; good morning.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs we walked briskly away from the house, I glanced at him more than\r\nonce. I had often before noticed that, if anything excited him, his\r\neyes turned green like a cat\u2019s. They were shining like emeralds now.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy friend,\u201d he broke out at last, \u201cI have a little idea, a very\r\nstrange, and probably utterly impossible idea. And yet\u2014it fits in.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders. I privately thought that Poirot was rather too\r\nmuch given to these fantastic ideas. In this case, surely, the truth\r\nwas only too plain and apparent.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo that is the explanation of the blank label on the box,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\u201cVery simple, as you said. I really wonder that I did not think of it\r\nmyself.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot did not appear to be listening to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have made one more discovery, _l\u00e0-bas_,\u201d he observed, jerking his\r\nthumb over his shoulder in the direction of Styles. \u201cMr. Wells told me\r\nas we were going upstairs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat was it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLocked up in the desk in the boudoir, they found a will of Mrs.\r\nInglethorp\u2019s, dated before her marriage, leaving her fortune to Alfred\r\nInglethorp. It must have been made just at the time they were engaged.\r\nIt came quite as a surprise to Wells\u2014and to John Cavendish also. It was\r\nwritten on one of those printed will forms, and witnessed by two of the\r\nservants\u2014not Dorcas.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid Mr. Inglethorp know of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe says not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne might take that with a grain of salt,\u201d I remarked sceptically.\r\n\u201cAll these wills are very confusing. Tell me, how did those scribbled\r\nwords on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made\r\nyesterday afternoon?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon ami_, have you ever, when writing a letter, been arrested by the\r\nfact that you did not know how to spell a certain word?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, often. I suppose everyone has.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. And have you not, in such a case, tried the word once or\r\ntwice on the edge of the blotting-paper, or a spare scrap of paper, to\r\nsee if it looked right? Well, that is what Mrs. Inglethorp did. You\r\nwill notice that the word \u2018possessed\u2019 is spelt first with one \u2018s\u2019 and\r\nsubsequently with two\u2014correctly. To make sure, she had further tried it\r\nin a sentence, thus: \u2018I am possessed.\u2019 Now, what did that tell me? It\r\ntold me that Mrs. Inglethorp had been writing the word \u2018possessed\u2019 that\r\nafternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh\r\nin my mind, the possibility of a will\u2014(a document almost certain to\r\ncontain that word)\u2014occurred to me at once. This possibility was\r\nconfirmed by a further circumstance. In the general confusion, the\r\nboudoir had not been swept that morning, and near the desk were several\r\ntraces of brown mould and earth. The weather had been perfectly fine\r\nfor some days, and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\n\u201cI strolled to the window, and saw at once that the begonia beds had\r\nbeen newly planted. The mould in the beds was exactly similar to that\r\non the floor of the boudoir, and also I learnt from you that they _had_\r\nbeen planted yesterday afternoon. I was now sure that one, or possibly\r\nboth of the gardeners\u2014for there were two sets of footprints in the\r\nbed\u2014had entered the boudoir, for if Mrs. Inglethorp had merely wished\r\nto speak to them she would in all probability have stood at the window,\r\nand they would not have come into the room at all. I was now quite\r\nconvinced that she had made a fresh will, and had called the two\r\ngardeners in to witness her signature. Events proved that I was right\r\nin my supposition.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was very ingenious,\u201d I could not help admitting. \u201cI must confess\r\nthat the conclusions I drew from those few scribbled words were quite\r\nerroneous.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou gave too much rein to your imagination. Imagination is a good\r\nservant, and a bad master. The simplest explanation is always the most\r\nlikely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnother point\u2014how did you know that the key of the despatch-case had\r\nbeen lost?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did not know it. It was a guess that turned out to be correct. You\r\nobserved that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle. That\r\nsuggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy\r\nkey-ring. Now, if it had been lost and recovered, Mrs. Inglethorp would\r\nat once have replaced it on her bunch; but on her bunch I found what\r\nwas obviously the duplicate key, very new and bright, which led me to\r\nthe hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the\r\nlock of the despatch-case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cAlfred Inglethorp, without doubt.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot looked at me curiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are very sure of his guilt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, naturally. Every fresh circumstance seems to establish it more\r\nclearly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d said Poirot quietly, \u201cthere are several points in\r\nhis favour.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, come now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see only one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat he was not in the house last night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Bad shot!\u2019 as you English say! You have chosen the one point that to\r\nmy mind tells against him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow is that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause if Mr. Inglethorp knew that his wife would be poisoned last\r\nnight, he would certainly have arranged to be away from the house. His\r\nexcuse was an obviously trumped up one. That leaves us two\r\npossibilities: either he knew what was going to happen or he had a\r\nreason of his own for his absence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that reason?\u201d I asked sceptically.\r\n\r\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow should I know? Discreditable, without doubt. This Mr. Inglethorp,\r\nI should say, is somewhat of a scoundrel\u2014but that does not of necessity\r\nmake him a murderer.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head, unconvinced.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe do not agree, eh?\u201d said Poirot. \u201cWell, let us leave it. Time will\r\nshow which of us is right. Now let us turn to other aspects of the\r\ncase. What do you make of the fact that all the doors of the bedroom\r\nwere bolted on the inside?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell\u2014\u2014\u201d I considered. \u201cOne must look at it logically.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should put it this way. The doors _were_ bolted\u2014our own eyes have\r\ntold us that\u2014yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor, and\r\nthe destruction of the will, prove that during the night someone\r\nentered the room. You agree so far?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerfectly. Put with admirable clearness. Proceed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, encouraged, \u201cas the person who entered did not do so by\r\nthe window, nor by miraculous means, it follows that the door must have\r\nbeen opened from inside by Mrs. Inglethorp herself. That strengthens\r\nthe conviction that the person in question was her husband. She would\r\nnaturally open the door to her own husband.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy should she? She had bolted the door leading into his room\u2014a most\r\nunusual proceeding on her part\u2014she had had a most violent quarrel with\r\nhim that very afternoon. No, he was the last person she would admit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you agree with me that the door must have been opened by Mrs.\r\nInglethorp herself?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is another possibility. She may have forgotten to bolt the door\r\ninto the passage when she went to bed, and have got up later, towards\r\nmorning, and bolted it then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot, is that seriously your opinion?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I do not say it is so, but it might be. Now, to turn to another\r\nfeature, what do you make of the scrap of conversation you overheard\r\nbetween Mrs. Cavendish and her mother-in-law?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI had forgotten that,\u201d I said thoughtfully. \u201cThat is as enigmatical as\r\never. It seems incredible that a woman like Mrs. Cavendish, proud and\r\nreticent to the last degree, should interfere so violently in what was\r\ncertainly not her affair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely. It was an astonishing thing for a woman of her breeding to\r\ndo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is certainly curious,\u201d I agreed. \u201cStill, it is unimportant, and\r\nneed not be taken into account.\u201d\r\n\r\nA groan burst from Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have I always told you? Everything must be taken into account. If\r\nthe fact will not fit the theory\u2014let the theory go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we shall see,\u201d I said, nettled.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, we shall see.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had reached Leastways Cottage, and Poirot ushered me upstairs to his\r\nown room. He offered me one of the tiny Russian cigarettes he himself\r\noccasionally smoked. I was amused to notice that he stowed away the\r\nused matches most carefully in a little china pot. My momentary\r\nannoyance vanished.\r\n\r\nPoirot had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which\r\ncommanded a view of the village street. The fresh air blew in warm and\r\npleasant. It was going to be a hot day.\r\n\r\nSuddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing\r\ndown the street at a great pace. It was the expression on his face that\r\nwas extraordinary\u2014a curious mingling of terror and agitation.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook, Poirot!\u201d I said.\r\n\r\nHe leant forward.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Tiens!_\u201d he said. \u201cIt is Mr. Mace, from the chemist\u2019s shop. He is\r\ncoming here.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young man came to a halt before Leastways Cottage, and, after\r\nhesitating a moment, pounded vigorously at the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cA little minute,\u201d cried Poirot from the window. \u201cI come.\u201d\r\n\r\nMotioning to me to follow him, he ran swiftly down the stairs and\r\nopened the door. Mr. Mace began at once.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Mr. Poirot, I\u2019m sorry for the inconvenience, but I heard that\r\nyou\u2019d just come back from the Hall?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, we have.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young man moistened his dry lips. His face was working curiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all over the village about old Mrs. Inglethorp dying so suddenly.\r\nThey do say\u2014\u201d he lowered his voice cautiously\u2014\u201cthat it\u2019s poison?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot\u2019s face remained quite impassive.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly the doctors can tell us that, Mr. Mace.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, exactly\u2014of course\u2014\u2014\u201d The young man hesitated, and then his\r\nagitation was too much for him. He clutched Poirot by the arm, and sank\r\nhis voice to a whisper: \u201cJust tell me this, Mr. Poirot, it isn\u2019t\u2014it\r\nisn\u2019t strychnine, is it?\u201d\r\n\r\nI hardly heard what Poirot replied. Something evidently of a\r\nnon-committal nature. The young man departed, and as he closed the door\r\nPoirot\u2019s eyes met mine.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, nodding gravely. \u201cHe will have evidence to give at the\r\ninquest.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe went slowly upstairs again. I was opening my lips, when Poirot\r\nstopped me with a gesture of his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot now, not now, _mon ami_. I have need of reflection. My mind is in\r\nsome disorder\u2014which is not well.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor about ten minutes he sat in dead silence, perfectly still, except\r\nfor several expressive motions of his eyebrows, and all the time his\r\neyes grew steadily greener. At last he heaved a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is well. The bad moment has passed. Now all is arranged and\r\nclassified. One must never permit confusion. The case is not clear\r\nyet\u2014no. For it is of the most complicated! It puzzles _me_. _Me_,\r\nHercule Poirot! There are two facts of significance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what are they?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first is the state of the weather yesterday. That is very\r\nimportant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it was a glorious day!\u201d I interrupted. \u201cPoirot, you\u2019re pulling my\r\nleg!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. The thermometer registered 80 degrees in the shade. Do not\r\nforget that, my friend. It is the key to the whole riddle!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the second point?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe important fact that Monsieur Inglethorp wears very peculiar\r\nclothes, has a black beard, and uses glasses.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot, I cannot believe you are serious.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am absolutely serious, my friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut this is childish!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it is very momentous.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd supposing the Coroner\u2019s jury returns a verdict of Wilful Murder\r\nagainst Alfred Inglethorp. What becomes of your theories, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey would not be shaken because twelve stupid men had happened to\r\nmake a mistake! But that will not occur. For one thing, a country jury\r\nis not anxious to take responsibility upon itself, and Mr. Inglethorp\r\nstands practically in the position of local squire. Also,\u201d he added\r\nplacidly, \u201c_I_ should not allow it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_You_ would not allow it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked at the extraordinary little man, divided between annoyance and\r\namusement. He was so tremendously sure of himself. As though he read my\r\nthoughts, he nodded gently.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, _mon ami_, I would do what I say.\u201d He got up and laid his\r\nhand on my shoulder. His physiognomy underwent a complete change. Tears\r\ncame into his eyes. \u201cIn all this, you see, I think of that poor Mrs.\r\nInglethorp who is dead. She was not extravagantly loved\u2014no. But she was\r\nvery good to us Belgians\u2014I owe her a debt.\u201d\r\n\r\nI endeavoured to interrupt, but Poirot swept on.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me tell you this, Hastings. She would never forgive me if I let\r\nAlfred Inglethorp, her husband, be arrested _now_\u2014when a word from me\r\ncould save him!\u201d\r\n\nIn the interval before the inquest, Poirot was unfailing in his\r\nactivity. Twice he was closeted with Mr. Wells. He also took long walks\r\ninto the country. I rather resented his not taking me into his\r\nconfidence, the more so as I could not in the least guess what he was\r\ndriving at.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that he might have been making inquiries at Raikes\u2019s\r\nfarm; so, finding him out when I called at Leastways Cottage on\r\nWednesday evening, I walked over there by the fields, hoping to meet\r\nhim. But there was no sign of him, and I hesitated to go right up to\r\nthe farm itself. As I walked away, I met an aged rustic, who leered at\r\nme cunningly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019m from the Hall, bain\u2019t you?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I\u2019m looking for a friend of mine whom I thought might have walked\r\nthis way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA little chap? As waves his hands when he talks? One of them Belgies\r\nfrom the village?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said eagerly. \u201cHe has been here, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, ay, he\u2019s been here, right enough. More\u2019n once too. Friend of\r\nyours, is he? Ah, you gentlemen from the Hall\u2014you\u2019m a pretty lot!\u201d And\r\nhe leered more jocosely than ever.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, do the gentlemen from the Hall come here often?\u201d I asked, as\r\ncarelessly as I could.\r\n\r\nHe winked at me knowingly.\r\n\r\n\u201c_One_ does, mister. Naming no names, mind. And a very liberal\r\ngentleman too! Oh, thank you, sir, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\r\n\r\nI walked on sharply. Evelyn Howard had been right then, and I\r\nexperienced a sharp twinge of disgust, as I thought of Alfred\r\nInglethorp\u2019s liberality with another woman\u2019s money. Had that piquant\r\ngipsy face been at the bottom of the crime, or was it the baser\r\nmainspring of money? Probably a judicious mixture of both.\r\n\r\nOn one point, Poirot seemed to have a curious obsession. He once or\r\ntwice observed to me that he thought Dorcas must have made an error in\r\nfixing the time of the quarrel. He suggested to her repeatedly that it\r\nwas four-thirty, and not four o\u2019clock when she had heard the voices.\r\n\r\nBut Dorcas was unshaken. Quite an hour, or even more, had elapsed\r\nbetween the time when she had heard the voices and five o\u2019clock, when\r\nshe had taken tea to her mistress.\r\n\r\nThe inquest was held on Friday at the Stylites Arms in the village.\r\nPoirot and I sat together, not being required to give evidence.\r\n\r\nThe preliminaries were gone through. The jury viewed the body, and John\r\nCavendish gave evidence of identification.\r\n\r\nFurther questioned, he described his awakening in the early hours of\r\nthe morning, and the circumstances of his mother\u2019s death.\r\n\r\nThe medical evidence was next taken. There was a breathless hush, and\r\nevery eye was fixed on the famous London specialist, who was known to\r\nbe one of the greatest authorities of the day on the subject of\r\ntoxicology.\r\n\r\nIn a few brief words, he summed up the result of the post-mortem. Shorn\r\nof its medical phraseology and technicalities, it amounted to the fact\r\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp had met her death as the result of strychnine\r\npoisoning. Judging from the quantity recovered, she must have taken not\r\nless than three-quarters of a grain of strychnine, but probably one\r\ngrain or slightly over.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it possible that she could have swallowed the poison by accident?\u201d\r\nasked the Coroner.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should consider it very unlikely. Strychnine is not used for\r\ndomestic purposes, as some poisons are, and there are restrictions\r\nplaced on its sale.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes anything in your examination lead you to determine how the poison\r\nwas administered?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou arrived at Styles before Dr. Wilkins, I believe?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is so. The motor met me just outside the lodge gates, and I\r\nhurried there as fast as I could.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you relate to us exactly what happened next?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI entered Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s room. She was at that moment in a typical\r\ntetanic convulsion. She turned towards me, and gasped out:\r\n\u2018Alfred\u2014Alfred\u2014\u2014\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCould the strychnine have been administered in Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s\r\nafter-dinner coffee which was taken to her by her husband?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPossibly, but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action. The\r\nsymptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed. It\r\nis retarded under certain conditions, none of which, however, appear to\r\nhave been present in this case. I presume Mrs. Inglethorp took the\r\ncoffee after dinner about eight o\u2019clock, whereas the symptoms did not\r\nmanifest themselves until the early hours of the morning, which, on the\r\nface of it, points to the drug having been taken much later in the\r\nevening.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Inglethorp was in the habit of drinking a cup of cocoa in the\r\nmiddle of the night. Could the strychnine have been administered in\r\nthat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I myself took a sample of the cocoa remaining in the saucepan and\r\nhad it analysed. There was no strychnine present.\u201d\r\n\r\nI heard Poirot chuckle softly beside me.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you know?\u201d I whispered.\r\n\r\n\u201cListen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should say\u201d\u2014the doctor was continuing\u2014\u201cthat I would have been\r\nconsiderably surprised at any other result.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSimply because strychnine has an unusually bitter taste. It can be\r\ndetected in a solution of one in seventy thousand, and can only be\r\ndisguised by some strongly flavoured substance. Cocoa would be quite\r\npowerless to mask it.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne of the jury wanted to know if the same objection applied to coffee.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. Coffee has a bitter taste of its own which would probably cover\r\nthe taste of strychnine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you consider it more likely that the drug was administered in the\r\ncoffee, but that for some unknown reason its action was delayed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but, the cup being completely smashed, there is no possibility of\r\nanalyzing its contents.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis concluded Dr. Bauerstein\u2019s evidence. Dr. Wilkins corroborated it\r\non all points. Sounded as to the possibility of suicide, he repudiated\r\nit utterly. The deceased, he said, suffered from a weak heart, but\r\notherwise enjoyed perfect health, and was of a cheerful and\r\nwell-balanced disposition. She would be one of the last people to take\r\nher own life.\r\n\r\nLawrence Cavendish was next called. His evidence was quite unimportant,\r\nbeing a mere repetition of that of his brother. Just as he was about to\r\nstep down, he paused, and said rather hesitatingly:\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like to make a suggestion if I may?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe glanced deprecatingly at the Coroner, who replied briskly:\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, Mr. Cavendish, we are here to arrive at the truth of this\r\nmatter, and welcome anything that may lead to further elucidation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is just an idea of mine,\u201d explained Lawrence. \u201cOf course I may be\r\nquite wrong, but it still seems to me that my mother\u2019s death might be\r\naccounted for by natural means.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you make that out, Mr. Cavendish?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy mother, at the time of her death, and for some time before it, was\r\ntaking a tonic containing strychnine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said the Coroner.\r\n\r\nThe jury looked up, interested.\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe,\u201d continued Lawrence, \u201cthat there have been cases where the\r\ncumulative effect of a drug, administered for some time, has ended by\r\ncausing death. Also, is it not possible that she may have taken an\r\noverdose of her medicine by accident?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at\r\nthe time of her death. We are much obliged to you, Mr. Cavendish.\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Wilkins was recalled and ridiculed the idea.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat Mr. Cavendish suggests is quite impossible. Any doctor would tell\r\nyou the same. Strychnine is, in a certain sense, a cumulative poison,\r\nbut it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in\r\nthis way. There would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms\r\nwhich would at once have attracted my attention. The whole thing is\r\nabsurd.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the second suggestion? That Mrs. Inglethorp may have inadvertently\r\ntaken an overdose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThree, or even four doses, would not have resulted in death. Mrs.\r\nInglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a\r\ntime, as she dealt with Coot\u2019s, the Cash Chemists in Tadminster. She\r\nwould have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the\r\namount of strychnine found at the post-mortem.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any\r\nway instrumental in causing her death?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. The supposition is ridiculous.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that the\r\nchemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat, of course, is always possible,\u201d replied the doctor.\r\n\r\nBut Dorcas, who was the next witness called, dispelled even that\r\npossibility. The medicine had not been newly made up. On the contrary,\r\nMrs. Inglethorp had taken the last dose on the day of her death.\r\n\r\nSo the question of the tonic was finally abandoned, and the Coroner\r\nproceeded with his task. Having elicited from Dorcas how she had been\r\nawakened by the violent ringing of her mistress\u2019s bell, and had\r\nsubsequently roused the household, he passed to the subject of the\r\nquarrel on the preceding afternoon.\r\n\r\nDorcas\u2019s evidence on this point was substantially what Poirot and I had\r\nalready heard, so I will not repeat it here.\r\n\r\nThe next witness was Mary Cavendish. She stood very upright, and spoke\r\nin a low, clear, and perfectly composed voice. In answer to the\r\nCoroner\u2019s question, she told how, her alarm clock having aroused her at\r\nfour-thirty as usual, she was dressing, when she was startled by the\r\nsound of something heavy falling.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat would have been the table by the bed?\u201d commented the Coroner.\r\n\r\n\u201cI opened my door,\u201d continued Mary, \u201cand listened. In a few minutes a\r\nbell rang violently. Dorcas came running down and woke my husband, and\r\nwe all went to my mother-in-law\u2019s room, but it was locked\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Coroner interrupted her.\r\n\r\n\u201cI really do not think we need trouble you further on that point. We\r\nknow all that can be known of the subsequent happenings. But I should\r\nbe obliged if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the\r\nday before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI?\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a faint insolence in her voice. She raised her hand and\r\nadjusted the ruffle of lace at her neck, turning her head a little as\r\nshe did so. And quite spontaneously the thought flashed across my mind:\r\n\u201cShe is gaining time!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I understand,\u201d continued the Coroner deliberately, \u201cthat you were\r\nsitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the\r\nboudoir. That is so, is it not?\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was news to me and glancing sideways at Poirot, I fancied that it\r\nwas news to him as well.\r\n\r\nThere was the faintest pause, the mere hesitation of a moment, before\r\nshe answered:\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that is so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the boudoir window was open, was it not?\u201d\r\n\r\nSurely her face grew a little paler as she answered:\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you cannot have failed to hear the voices inside, especially as\r\nthey were raised in anger. In fact, they would be more audible where\r\nyou were than in the hall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPossibly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI really do not remember hearing anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean to say you did not hear voices?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, I heard the voices, but I did not hear what they said.\u201d A\r\nfaint spot of colour came into her cheek. \u201cI am not in the habit of\r\nlistening to private conversations.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Coroner persisted.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you remember nothing at all? _Nothing_, Mrs. Cavendish? Not one\r\nstray word or phrase to make you realize that it _was_ a private\r\nconversation?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe paused, and seemed to reflect, still outwardly as calm as ever.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; I remember. Mrs. Inglethorp said something\u2014I do not remember\r\nexactly what\u2014about causing scandal between husband and wife.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d the Coroner leant back satisfied. \u201cThat corresponds with what\r\nDorcas heard. But excuse me, Mrs. Cavendish, although you realized it\r\nwas a private conversation, you did not move away? You remained where\r\nyou were?\u201d\r\n\r\nI caught the momentary gleam of her tawny eyes as she raised them. I\r\nfelt certain that at that moment she would willingly have torn the\r\nlittle lawyer, with his insinuations, into pieces, but she replied\r\nquietly enough:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. I was very comfortable where I was. I fixed my mind on my book.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that is all you can tell us?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is all.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe examination was over, though I doubted if the Coroner was entirely\r\nsatisfied with it. I think he suspected that Mary Cavendish could tell\r\nmore if she chose.\r\n\r\nAmy Hill, shop assistant, was next called, and deposed to having sold a\r\nwill form on the afternoon of the 17th to William Earl, under-gardener\r\nat Styles.\r\n\r\nWilliam Earl and Manning succeeded her, and testified to witnessing a\r\ndocument. Manning fixed the time at about four-thirty, William was of\r\nthe opinion that it was rather earlier.\r\n\r\nCynthia Murdoch came next. She had, however, little to tell. She had\r\nknown nothing of the tragedy, until awakened by Mrs. Cavendish.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did not hear the table fall?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. I was fast asleep.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Coroner smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cA good conscience makes a sound sleeper,\u201d he observed. \u201cThank you,\r\nMiss Murdoch, that is all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Howard.\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Howard produced the letter written to her by Mrs. Inglethorp on\r\nthe evening of the 17th. Poirot and I had, of course already seen it.\r\nIt added nothing to our knowledge of the tragedy. The following is a\r\nfacsimile:\r\n\r\nSTYLES COURT\r\nESSEX\r\nhand written note:\r\n\r\n     July 17th\r\n     My dear Evelyn\r\n     Can we not bury\r\n     the hachet? I have\r\n     found it hard to forgive\r\n     the things you said\r\n     against my dear husband\r\n     but I am an old woman\r\n     & very fond of you\r\n     Yours affectionately,\r\n    Emily Inglethorpe\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was handed to the jury who scrutinized it attentively.\r\n\r\n\u201cI fear it does not help us much,\u201d said the Coroner, with a sigh.\r\n\u201cThere is no mention of any of the events of that afternoon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPlain as a pikestaff to me,\u201d said Miss Howard shortly. \u201cIt shows\r\nclearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out she\u2019d been\r\nmade a fool of!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt says nothing of the kind in the letter,\u201d the Coroner pointed out.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, because Emily never could bear to put herself in the wrong. But\r\n_I_ know her. She wanted me back. But she wasn\u2019t going to own that I\u2019d\r\nbeen right. She went round about. Most people do. Don\u2019t believe in it\r\nmyself.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Wells smiled faintly. So, I noticed, did several of the jury. Miss\r\nHoward was obviously quite a public character.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnyway, all this tomfoolery is a great waste of time,\u201d continued the\r\nlady, glancing up and down the jury disparagingly. \u201cTalk\u2014talk\u2014talk!\r\nWhen all the time we know perfectly well\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Coroner interrupted her in an agony of apprehension:\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, Miss Howard, that is all.\u201d\r\n\r\nI fancy he breathed a sigh of relief when she complied.\r\n\r\nThen came the sensation of the day. The Coroner called Albert Mace,\r\nchemist\u2019s assistant.\r\n\r\nIt was our agitated young man of the pale face. In answer to the\r\nCoroner\u2019s questions, he explained that he was a qualified pharmacist,\r\nbut had only recently come to this particular shop, as the assistant\r\nformerly there had just been called up for the army.\r\n\r\nThese preliminaries completed, the Coroner proceeded to business.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Mace, have you lately sold strychnine to any unauthorized person?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen was this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLast Monday night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMonday? Not Tuesday?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, Monday, the 16th.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you tell us to whom you sold it?\u201d\r\n\r\nYou could have heard a pin drop.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. It was to Mr. Inglethorp.\u201d\r\n\r\nEvery eye turned simultaneously to where Alfred Inglethorp was sitting,\r\nimpassive and wooden. He started slightly, as the damning words fell\r\nfrom the young man\u2019s lips. I half thought he was going to rise from his\r\nchair, but he remained seated, although a remarkably well acted\r\nexpression of astonishment rose on his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are sure of what you say?\u201d asked the Coroner sternly.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite sure, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you in the habit of selling strychnine indiscriminately over the\r\ncounter?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe wretched young man wilted visibly under the Coroner\u2019s frown.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, sir\u2014of course not. But, seeing it was Mr. Inglethorp of the\r\nHall, I thought there was no harm in it. He said it was to poison a\r\ndog.\u201d\r\n\r\nInwardly I sympathized. It was only human nature to endeavour to please\r\n\u201cThe Hall\u201d\u2014especially when it might result in custom being transferred\r\nfrom Coot\u2019s to the local establishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, Mr. Inglethorp did so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you got the book here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was produced; and, with a few words of stern censure, the Coroner\r\ndismissed the wretched Mr. Mace.\r\n\r\nThen, amidst a breathless silence, Alfred Inglethorp was called. Did he\r\nrealize, I wondered, how closely the halter was being drawn around his\r\nneck?\r\n\r\nThe Coroner went straight to the point.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn Monday evening last, did you purchase strychnine for the purpose of\r\npoisoning a dog?\u201d\r\n\r\nInglethorp replied with perfect calmness:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I did not. There is no dog at Styles, except an outdoor sheepdog,\r\nwhich is in perfect health.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou deny absolutely having purchased strychnine from Albert Mace on\r\nMonday last?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you also deny _this_?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Coroner handed him the register in which his signature was\r\ninscribed.\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly I do. The hand-writing is quite different from mine. I will\r\nshow you.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe took an old envelope out of his pocket, and wrote his name on it,\r\nhanding it to the jury. It was certainly utterly dissimilar.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen what is your explanation of Mr. Mace\u2019s statement?\u201d\r\n\r\nAlfred Inglethorp replied imperturbably:\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Mace must have been mistaken.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Coroner hesitated for a moment, and then said:\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Inglethorp, as a mere matter of form, would you mind telling us\r\nwhere you were on the evening of Monday, July 16th?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally\u2014I cannot remember.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is absurd, Mr. Inglethorp,\u201d said the Coroner sharply. \u201cThink\r\nagain.\u201d\r\n\r\nInglethorp shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot tell you. I have an idea that I was out walking.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn what direction?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI really can\u2019t remember.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Coroner\u2019s face grew graver.\r\n\r\n\u201cWere you in company with anyone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you meet anyone on your walk?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a pity,\u201d said the Coroner dryly. \u201cI am to take it then that\r\nyou decline to say where you were at the time that Mr. Mace positively\r\nrecognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you like to take it that way, yes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBe careful, Mr. Inglethorp.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot was fidgeting nervously.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Sacr\u00e9!_\u201d he murmured. \u201cDoes this imbecile of a man _want_ to be\r\narrested?\u201d\r\n\r\nInglethorp was indeed creating a bad impression. His futile denials\r\nwould not have convinced a child. The Coroner, however, passed briskly\r\nto the next point, and Poirot drew a deep breath of relief.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou had a discussion with your wife on Tuesday afternoon?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPardon me,\u201d interrupted Alfred Inglethorp, \u201cyou have been misinformed.\r\nI had no quarrel with my dear wife. The whole story is absolutely\r\nuntrue. I was absent from the house the entire afternoon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you anyone who can testify to that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have my word,\u201d said Inglethorp haughtily.\r\n\r\nThe Coroner did not trouble to reply.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are two witnesses who will swear to having heard your\r\ndisagreement with Mrs. Inglethorp.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThose witnesses were mistaken.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was puzzled. The man spoke with such quiet assurance that I was\r\nstaggered. I looked at Poirot. There was an expression of exultation on\r\nhis face which I could not understand. Was he at last convinced of\r\nAlfred Inglethorp\u2019s guilt?\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Inglethorp,\u201d said the Coroner, \u201cyou have heard your wife\u2019s dying\r\nwords repeated here. Can you explain them in any way?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly I can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me very simple. The room was dimly lighted. Dr. Bauerstein\r\nis much of my height and build, and, like me, wears a beard. In the dim\r\nlight, and suffering as she was, my poor wife mistook him for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d murmured Poirot to himself. \u201cBut it is an idea, that!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think it is true?\u201d I whispered.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not say that. But it is truly an ingenious supposition.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou read my wife\u2019s last words as an accusation\u201d\u2014Inglethorp was\r\ncontinuing\u2014\u201cthey were, on the contrary, an appeal to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Coroner reflected a moment, then he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe, Mr. Inglethorp, that you yourself poured out the coffee,\r\nand took it to your wife that evening?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI poured it out, yes. But I did not take it to her. I meant to do so,\r\nbut I was told that a friend was at the hall door, so I laid down the\r\ncoffee on the hall table. When I came through the hall again a few\r\nminutes later, it was gone.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis statement might, or might not, be true, but it did not seem to me\r\nto improve matters much for Inglethorp. In any case, he had had ample\r\ntime to introduce the poison.\r\n\r\nAt that point, Poirot nudged me gently, indicating two men who were\r\nsitting together near the door. One was a little, sharp, dark,\r\nferret-faced man, the other was tall and fair.\r\n\r\nI questioned Poirot mutely. He put his lips to my ear.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know who that little man is?\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is Detective Inspector James Japp of Scotland Yard\u2014Jimmy Japp.\r\nThe other man is from Scotland Yard too. Things are moving quickly, my\r\nfriend.\u201d\r\n\r\nI stared at the two men intently. There was certainly nothing of the\r\npoliceman about them. I should never have suspected them of being\r\nofficial personages.\r\n\r\nI was still staring, when I was startled and recalled by the verdict\r\nbeing given:\r\n\r\n\u201cWilful Murder against some person or persons unknown.\u201d\r\n\nAs we came out of the Stylites Arms, Poirot drew me aside by a gentle\r\npressure of the arm. I understood his object. He was waiting for the\r\nScotland Yard men.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments, they emerged, and Poirot at once stepped forward, and\r\naccosted the shorter of the two.\r\n\r\n\u201cI fear you do not remember me, Inspector Japp.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, if it isn\u2019t Mr. Poirot!\u201d cried the Inspector. He turned to the\r\nother man. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard me speak of Mr. Poirot? It was in 1904 he and\r\nI worked together\u2014the Abercrombie forgery case\u2014you remember, he was run\r\ndown in Brussels. Ah, those were great days, moosier. Then, do you\r\nremember \u2018Baron\u2019 Altara? There was a pretty rogue for you! He eluded\r\nthe clutches of half the police in Europe. But we nailed him in\r\nAntwerp\u2014thanks to Mr. Poirot here.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs these friendly reminiscences were being indulged in, I drew nearer,\r\nand was introduced to Detective-Inspector Japp, who, in his turn,\r\nintroduced us both to his companion, Superintendent Summerhaye.\r\n\r\n\u201cI need hardly ask what you are doing here, gentlemen,\u201d remarked\r\nPoirot.\r\n\r\nJapp closed one eye knowingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed. Pretty clear case I should say.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Poirot answered gravely:\r\n\r\n\u201cThere I differ from you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, come!\u201d said Summerhaye, opening his lips for the first time.\r\n\u201cSurely the whole thing is clear as daylight. The man\u2019s caught\r\nred-handed. How he could be such a fool beats me!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Japp was looking attentively at Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your fire, Summerhaye,\u201d he remarked jocularly. \u201cMe and Moosier\r\nhere have met before\u2014and there\u2019s no man\u2019s judgment I\u2019d sooner take than\r\nhis. If I\u2019m not greatly mistaken, he\u2019s got something up his sleeve.\r\nIsn\u2019t that so, moosier?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have drawn certain conclusions\u2014yes.\u201d\r\n\r\nSummerhaye was still looking rather sceptical, but Japp continued his\r\nscrutiny of Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s this way,\u201d he said, \u201cso far, we\u2019ve only seen the case from the\r\noutside. That\u2019s where the Yard\u2019s at a disadvantage in a case of this\r\nkind, where the murder\u2019s only out, so to speak, after the inquest. A\r\nlot depends on being on the spot first thing, and that\u2019s where Mr.\r\nPoirot\u2019s had the start of us. We shouldn\u2019t have been here as soon as\r\nthis even, if it hadn\u2019t been for the fact that there was a smart doctor\r\non the spot, who gave us the tip through the Coroner. But you\u2019ve been\r\non the spot from the first, and you may have picked up some little\r\nhints. From the evidence at the inquest, Mr. Inglethorp murdered his\r\nwife as sure as I stand here, and if anyone but you hinted the contrary\r\nI\u2019d laugh in his face. I must say I was surprised the jury didn\u2019t bring\r\nit in Wilful Murder against him right off. I think they would have, if\r\nit hadn\u2019t been for the Coroner\u2014he seemed to be holding them back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps, though, you have a warrant for his arrest in your pocket\r\nnow,\u201d suggested Poirot.\r\n\r\nA kind of wooden shutter of officialdom came down from Japp\u2019s\r\nexpressive countenance.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps I have, and perhaps I haven\u2019t,\u201d he remarked dryly.\r\n\r\nPoirot looked at him thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am very anxious, Messieurs, that he should not be arrested.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI dare say,\u201d observed Summerhaye sarcastically.\r\n\r\nJapp was regarding Poirot with comical perplexity.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you go a little further, Mr. Poirot? A wink\u2019s as good as a\r\nnod\u2014from you. You\u2019ve been on the spot\u2014and the Yard doesn\u2019t want to make\r\nany mistakes, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is exactly what I thought. Well, I will tell you this. Use your\r\nwarrant: Arrest Mr. Inglethorp. But it will bring you no kudos\u2014the case\r\nagainst him will be dismissed at once! _Comme \u00e7a!_\u201d And he snapped his\r\nfingers expressively.\r\n\r\nJapp\u2019s face grew grave, though Summerhaye gave an incredulous snort.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I was literally dumb with astonishment. I could only\r\nconclude that Poirot was mad.\r\n\r\nJapp had taken out a handkerchief, and was gently dabbing his brow.\r\n\r\n\u201cI daren\u2019t do it, Mr. Poirot. _I_\u2019d take your word, but there\u2019s others\r\nover me who\u2019ll be asking what the devil I mean by it. Can\u2019t you give me\r\na little more to go on?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot reflected a moment.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt can be done,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI admit I do not wish it. It forces\r\nmy hand. I would have preferred to work in the dark just for the\r\npresent, but what you say is very just\u2014the word of a Belgian policeman,\r\nwhose day is past, is not enough! And Alfred Inglethorp must not be\r\narrested. That I have sworn, as my friend Hastings here knows. See,\r\nthen, my good Japp, you go at once to Styles?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, in about half an hour. We\u2019re seeing the Coroner and the doctor\r\nfirst.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood. Call for me in passing\u2014the last house in the village. I will go\r\nwith you. At Styles, Mr. Inglethorp will give you, or if he refuses\u2014as\r\nis probable\u2014I will give you such proofs that shall satisfy you that the\r\ncase against him could not possibly be sustained. Is that a bargain?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a bargain,\u201d said Japp heartily. \u201cAnd, on behalf of the Yard,\r\nI\u2019m much obliged to you, though I\u2019m bound to confess I can\u2019t at present\r\nsee the faintest possible loop-hole in the evidence, but you always\r\nwere a marvel! So long, then, moosier.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe two detectives strode away, Summerhaye with an incredulous grin on\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, my friend,\u201d cried Poirot, before I could get in a word, \u201cwhat do\r\nyou think? _Mon Dieu!_ I had some warm moments in that court; I did not\r\nfigure to myself that the man would be so pig-headed as to refuse to\r\nsay anything at all. Decidedly, it was the policy of an imbecile.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cH\u2019m! There are other explanations besides that of imbecility,\u201d I\r\nremarked. \u201cFor, if the case against him is true, how could he defend\r\nhimself except by silence?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, in a thousand ingenious ways,\u201d cried Poirot. \u201cSee; say that it is\r\nI who have committed this murder, I can think of seven most plausible\r\nstories! Far more convincing than Mr. Inglethorp\u2019s stony denials!\u201d\r\n\r\nI could not help laughing.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Poirot, I am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy! But,\r\nseriously, in spite of what I heard you say to the detectives, you\r\nsurely cannot still believe in the possibility of Alfred Inglethorp\u2019s\r\ninnocence?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not now as much as before? Nothing has changed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the evidence is so conclusive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, too conclusive.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe turned in at the gate of Leastways Cottage, and proceeded up the now\r\nfamiliar stairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes, too conclusive,\u201d continued Poirot, almost to himself. \u201cReal\r\nevidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory. It has to be\r\nexamined\u2014sifted. But here the whole thing is cut and dried. No, my\r\nfriend, this evidence has been very cleverly manufactured\u2014so cleverly\r\nthat it has defeated its own ends.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you make that out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause, so long as the evidence against him was vague and intangible,\r\nit was very hard to disprove. But, in his anxiety, the criminal has\r\ndrawn the net so closely that one cut will set Inglethorp free.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was silent. And in a minute or two, Poirot continued:\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us look at the matter like this. Here is a man, let us say, who\r\nsets out to poison his wife. He has lived by his wits as the saying\r\ngoes. Presumably, therefore, he has some wits. He is not altogether a\r\nfool. Well, how does he set about it? He goes boldly to the village\r\nchemist\u2019s and purchases strychnine under his own name, with a trumped\r\nup story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd. He does not\r\nemploy the poison that night. No, he waits until he has had a violent\r\nquarrel with her, of which the whole household is cognisant, and which\r\nnaturally directs their suspicions upon him. He prepares no defence\u2014no\r\nshadow of an alibi, yet he knows the chemist\u2019s assistant must\r\nnecessarily come forward with the facts. Bah! Do not ask me to believe\r\nthat any man could be so idiotic! Only a lunatic, who wished to commit\r\nsuicide by causing himself to be hanged, would act so!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStill\u2014I do not see\u2014\u2014\u201d I began.\r\n\r\n\u201cNeither do I see. I tell you, _mon ami_, it puzzles me. _Me_\u2014Hercule\r\nPoirot!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut if you believe him innocent, how do you explain his buying the\r\nstrychnine?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery simply. He did _not_ buy it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut Mace recognized him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon, he saw a man with a black beard like Mr.\r\nInglethorp\u2019s, and wearing glasses like Mr. Inglethorp, and dressed in\r\nMr. Inglethorp\u2019s rather noticeable clothes. He could not recognize a\r\nman whom he had probably only seen in the distance, since, you\r\nremember, he himself had only been in the village a fortnight, and Mrs.\r\nInglethorp dealt principally with Coot\u2019s in Tadminster.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you think\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon ami_, do you remember the two points I laid stress upon? Leave\r\nthe first one for the moment, what was the second?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe important fact that Alfred Inglethorp wears peculiar clothes, has\r\na black beard, and uses glasses,\u201d I quoted.\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. Now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as John or\r\nLawrence Cavendish. Would it be easy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said thoughtfully. \u201cOf course an actor\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Poirot cut me short ruthlessly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why would it not be easy? I will tell you, my friend: Because they\r\nare both clean-shaven men. To make up successfully as one of these two\r\nin broad daylight, it would need an actor of genius, and a certain\r\ninitial facial resemblance. But in the case of Alfred Inglethorp, all\r\nthat is changed. His clothes, his beard, the glasses which hide his\r\neyes\u2014those are the salient points about his personal appearance. Now,\r\nwhat is the first instinct of the criminal? To divert suspicion from\r\nhimself, is it not so? And how can he best do that? By throwing it on\r\nsomeone else. In this instance, there was a man ready to his hand.\r\nEverybody was predisposed to believe in Mr. Inglethorp\u2019s guilt. It was\r\na foregone conclusion that he would be suspected; but, to make it a\r\nsure thing there must be tangible proof\u2014such as the actual buying of\r\nthe poison, and that, with a man of the peculiar appearance of Mr.\r\nInglethorp, was not difficult. Remember, this young Mace had never\r\nactually spoken to Mr. Inglethorp. How should he doubt that the man in\r\nhis clothes, with his beard and his glasses, was not Alfred\r\nInglethorp?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may be so,\u201d I said, fascinated by Poirot\u2019s eloquence. \u201cBut, if that\r\nwas the case, why does he not say where he was at six o\u2019clock on Monday\r\nevening?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, why indeed?\u201d said Poirot, calming down. \u201cIf he were arrested, he\r\nprobably would speak, but I do not want it to come to that. I must make\r\nhim see the gravity of his position. There is, of course, something\r\ndiscreditable behind his silence. If he did not murder his wife, he is,\r\nnevertheless, a scoundrel, and has something of his own to conceal,\r\nquite apart from the murder.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can it be?\u201d I mused, won over to Poirot\u2019s views for the moment,\r\nalthough still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction\r\nwas the correct one.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you not guess?\u201d asked Poirot, smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, can you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, I had a little idea sometime ago\u2014and it has turned out to be\r\ncorrect.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou never told me,\u201d I said reproachfully.\r\n\r\nPoirot spread out his hands apologetically.\r\n\r\n\u201cPardon me, _mon ami_, you were not precisely _sympathique_.\u201d He turned\r\nto me earnestly. \u201cTell me\u2014you see now that he must not be arrested?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d I said doubtfully, for I was really quite indifferent to the\r\nfate of Alfred Inglethorp, and thought that a good fright would do him\r\nno harm.\r\n\r\nPoirot, who was watching me intently, gave a sigh.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, my friend,\u201d he said, changing the subject, \u201capart from Mr.\r\nInglethorp, how did the evidence at the inquest strike you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, pretty much what I expected.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid nothing strike you as peculiar about it?\u201d\r\n\r\nMy thoughts flew to Mary Cavendish, and I hedged:\r\n\r\n\u201cIn what way?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish\u2019s evidence for instance?\u201d\r\n\r\nI was relieved.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Lawrence! No, I don\u2019t think so. He\u2019s always a nervous chap.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHis suggestion that his mother might have been poisoned accidentally\r\nby means of the tonic she was taking, that did not strike you as\r\nstrange\u2014 _hein?_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t say it did. The doctors ridiculed it of course. But it was\r\nquite a natural suggestion for a layman to make.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut Monsieur Lawrence is not a layman. You told me yourself that he\r\nhad started by studying medicine, and that he had taken his degree.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s true. I never thought of that.\u201d I was rather startled. \u201cIt\r\n_is_ odd.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom the first, his behaviour has been peculiar. Of all the household,\r\nhe alone would be likely to recognize the symptoms of strychnine\r\npoisoning, and yet we find him the only member of the family to uphold\r\nstrenuously the theory of death from natural causes. If it had been\r\nMonsieur John, I could have understood it. He has no technical\r\nknowledge, and is by nature unimaginative. But Monsieur Lawrence\u2014no!\r\nAnd now, to-day, he puts forward a suggestion that he himself must have\r\nknown was ridiculous. There is food for thought in this, _mon ami!_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s very confusing,\u201d I agreed.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen there is Mrs. Cavendish,\u201d continued Poirot. \u201cThat\u2019s another who\r\nis not telling all she knows! What do you make of her attitude?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to make of it. It seems inconceivable that she\r\nshould be shielding Alfred Inglethorp. Yet that is what it looks like.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded reflectively.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it is queer. One thing is certain, she overheard a good deal more\r\nof that \u2018private conversation\u2019 than she was willing to admit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet she is the last person one would accuse of stooping to\r\neavesdrop!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. One thing her evidence _has_ shown me. I made a mistake.\r\nDorcas was quite right. The quarrel did take place earlier in the\r\nafternoon, about four o\u2019clock, as she said.\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked at him curiously. I had never understood his insistence on\r\nthat point.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, a good deal that was peculiar came out to-day,\u201d continued Poirot.\r\n\u201cDr. Bauerstein, now, what was _he_ doing up and dressed at that hour\r\nin the morning? It is astonishing to me that no one commented on the\r\nfact.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has insomnia, I believe,\u201d I said doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich is a very good, or a very bad explanation,\u201d remarked Poirot. \u201cIt\r\ncovers everything, and explains nothing. I shall keep my eye on our\r\nclever Dr. Bauerstein.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAny more faults to find with the evidence?\u201d I inquired satirically.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon ami_,\u201d replied Poirot gravely, \u201cwhen you find that people are not\r\ntelling you the truth\u2014look out! Now, unless I am much mistaken, at the\r\ninquest to-day only one\u2014at most, two persons were speaking the truth\r\nwithout reservation or subterfuge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, come now, Poirot! I won\u2019t cite Lawrence, or Mrs. Cavendish. But\r\nthere\u2019s John\u2014and Miss Howard, surely they were speaking the truth?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBoth of them, my friend? One, I grant you, but both\u2014\u2014!\u201d\r\n\r\nHis words gave me an unpleasant shock. Miss Howard\u2019s evidence,\r\nunimportant as it was, had been given in such a downright\r\nstraightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt her\r\nsincerity. Still, I had a great respect for Poirot\u2019s sagacity\u2014except on\r\nthe occasions when he was what I described to myself as \u201cfoolishly\r\npig-headed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d I asked. \u201cMiss Howard had always seemed to me\r\nso essentially honest\u2014almost uncomfortably so.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot gave me a curious look, which I could not quite fathom. He\r\nseemed to speak, and then checked himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Murdoch too,\u201d I continued, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing untruthful about\r\n_her_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. But it was strange that she never heard a sound, sleeping next\r\ndoor; whereas Mrs. Cavendish, in the other wing of the building,\r\ndistinctly heard the table fall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, she\u2019s young. And she sleeps soundly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes, indeed! She must be a famous sleeper, that one!\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not quite like the tone of his voice, but at that moment a smart\r\nknock reached our ears, and looking out of the window we perceived the\r\ntwo detectives waiting for us below.\r\n\r\nPoirot seized his hat, gave a ferocious twist to his moustache, and,\r\ncarefully brushing an imaginary speck of dust from his sleeve, motioned\r\nme to precede him down the stairs; there we joined the detectives and\r\nset out for Styles.\r\n\r\nI think the appearance of the two Scotland Yard men was rather a\r\nshock\u2014especially to John, though of course after the verdict, he had\r\nrealized that it was only a matter of time. Still, the presence of the\r\ndetectives brought the truth home to him more than anything else could\r\nhave done.\r\n\r\nPoirot had conferred with Japp in a low tone on the way up, and it was\r\nthe latter functionary who requested that the household, with the\r\nexception of the servants, should be assembled together in the\r\ndrawing-room. I realized the significance of this. It was up to Poirot\r\nto make his boast good.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I was not sanguine. Poirot might have excellent reasons for\r\nhis belief in Inglethorp\u2019s innocence, but a man of the type of\r\nSummerhaye would require tangible proofs, and these I doubted if Poirot\r\ncould supply.\r\n\r\nBefore very long we had all trooped into the drawing-room, the door of\r\nwhich Japp closed. Poirot politely set chairs for everyone. The\r\nScotland Yard men were the cynosure of all eyes. I think that for the\r\nfirst time we realized that the thing was not a bad dream, but a\r\ntangible reality. We had read of such things\u2014now we ourselves were\r\nactors in the drama. To-morrow the daily papers, all over England,\r\nwould blazon out the news in staring headlines:\r\n\r\n\u201cMYSTERIOUS TRAGEDY IN ESSEX\u201d\r\n\r\n    \u201cWEALTHY LADY POISONED\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThere would be pictures of Styles, snap-shots of \u201cThe family leaving\r\nthe Inquest\u201d\u2014the village photographer had not been idle! All the things\r\nthat one had read a hundred times\u2014things that happen to other people,\r\nnot to oneself. And now, in this house, a murder had been committed. In\r\nfront of us were \u201cthe detectives in charge of the case.\u201d The well-known\r\nglib phraseology passed rapidly through my mind in the interval before\r\nPoirot opened the proceedings.\r\n\r\nI think everyone was a little surprised that it should be he and not\r\none of the official detectives who took the initiative.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mesdames_ and _messieurs_,\u201d said Poirot, bowing as though he were a\r\ncelebrity about to deliver a lecture, \u201cI have asked you to come here\r\nall together, for a certain object. That object, it concerns Mr. Alfred\r\nInglethorp.\u201d\r\n\r\nInglethorp was sitting a little by himself\u2014I think, unconsciously,\r\neveryone had drawn his chair slightly away from him\u2014and he gave a faint\r\nstart as Poirot pronounced his name.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Inglethorp,\u201d said Poirot, addressing him directly, \u201ca very dark\r\nshadow is resting on this house\u2014the shadow of murder.\u201d\r\n\r\nInglethorp shook his head sadly.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy poor wife,\u201d he murmured. \u201cPoor Emily! It is terrible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not think, monsieur,\u201d said Poirot pointedly, \u201cthat you quite\r\nrealize how terrible it may be\u2014for you.\u201d And as Inglethorp did not\r\nappear to understand, he added: \u201cMr. Inglethorp, you are standing in\r\nvery grave danger.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe two detectives fidgeted. I saw the official caution \u201cAnything you\r\nsay will be used in evidence against you,\u201d actually hovering on\r\nSummerhaye\u2019s lips. Poirot went on.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you understand now, monsieur?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. What do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI mean,\u201d said Poirot deliberately, \u201cthat you are suspected of\r\npoisoning your wife.\u201d\r\n\r\nA little gasp ran round the circle at this plain speaking.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d cried Inglethorp, starting up. \u201cWhat a monstrous idea!\r\n_I_\u2014poison my dearest Emily!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not think\u201d\u2014Poirot watched him narrowly\u2014\u201cthat you quite realize\r\nthe unfavourable nature of your evidence at the inquest. Mr.\r\nInglethorp, knowing what I have now told you, do you still refuse to\r\nsay where you were at six o\u2019clock on Monday afternoon?\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a groan, Alfred Inglethorp sank down again and buried his face in\r\nhis hands. Poirot approached and stood over him.\r\n\r\n\u201cSpeak!\u201d he cried menacingly.\r\n\r\nWith an effort, Inglethorp raised his face from his hands. Then, slowly\r\nand deliberately, he shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will not speak?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. I do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me\r\nof what you say.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully, like a man whose mind is made up.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Soit!_\u201d he said. \u201cThen I must speak for you.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlfred Inglethorp sprang up again.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou? How can you speak? You do not know\u2014\u2014\u201d he broke off abruptly.\r\n\r\nPoirot turned to face us. \u201c_Mesdames_ and _messieurs_! I speak! Listen!\r\nI, Hercule Poirot, affirm that the man who entered the chemist\u2019s shop,\r\nand purchased strychnine at six o\u2019clock on Monday last was not Mr.\r\nInglethorp, for at six o\u2019clock on that day Mr. Inglethorp was escorting\r\nMrs. Raikes back to her home from a neighbouring farm. I can produce no\r\nless than five witnesses to swear to having seen them together, either\r\nat six or just after and, as you may know, the Abbey Farm, Mrs.\r\nRaikes\u2019s home, is at least two and a half miles distant from the\r\nvillage. There is absolutely no question as to the alibi!\u201d\r\n\nThere was a moment\u2019s stupefied silence. Japp, who was the least\r\nsurprised of any of us, was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy word,\u201d he cried, \u201cyou\u2019re the goods! And no mistake, Mr. Poirot!\r\nThese witnesses of yours are all right, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Voil\u00e0!_ I have prepared a list of them\u2014names and addresses. You must\r\nsee them, of course. But you will find it all right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure of that.\u201d Japp lowered his voice. \u201cI\u2019m much obliged to you. A\r\npretty mare\u2019s nest arresting him would have been.\u201d He turned to\r\nInglethorp. \u201cBut, if you\u2019ll excuse me, sir, why couldn\u2019t you say all\r\nthis at the inquest?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will tell you why,\u201d interrupted Poirot. \u201cThere was a certain\r\nrumour\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA most malicious and utterly untrue one,\u201d interrupted Alfred\r\nInglethorp in an agitated voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Mr. Inglethorp was anxious to have no scandal revived just at\r\npresent. Am I right?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite right.\u201d Inglethorp nodded. \u201cWith my poor Emily not yet buried,\r\ncan you wonder I was anxious that no more lying rumours should be\r\nstarted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBetween you and me, sir,\u201d remarked Japp, \u201cI\u2019d sooner have any amount\r\nof rumours than be arrested for murder. And I venture to think your\r\npoor lady would have felt the same. And, if it hadn\u2019t been for Mr.\r\nPoirot here, arrested you would have been, as sure as eggs is eggs!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was foolish, no doubt,\u201d murmured Inglethorp. \u201cBut you do not know,\r\ninspector, how I have been persecuted and maligned.\u201d And he shot a\r\nbaleful glance at Evelyn Howard.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, sir,\u201d said Japp, turning briskly to John, \u201cI should like to see\r\nthe lady\u2019s bedroom, please, and after that I\u2019ll have a little chat with\r\nthe servants. Don\u2019t you bother about anything. Mr. Poirot, here, will\r\nshow me the way.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs they all went out of the room, Poirot turned and made me a sign to\r\nfollow him upstairs. There he caught me by the arm, and drew me aside.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuick, go to the other wing. Stand there\u2014just this side of the baize\r\ndoor. Do not move till I come.\u201d Then, turning rapidly, he rejoined the\r\ntwo detectives.\r\n\r\nI followed his instructions, taking up my position by the baize door,\r\nand wondering what on earth lay behind the request. Why was I to stand\r\nin this particular spot on guard? I looked thoughtfully down the\r\ncorridor in front of me. An idea struck me. With the exception of\r\nCynthia Murdoch\u2019s, everyone\u2019s room was in this left wing. Had that\r\nanything to do with it? Was I to report who came or went? I stood\r\nfaithfully at my post. The minutes passed. Nobody came. Nothing\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nIt must have been quite twenty minutes before Poirot rejoined me.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have not stirred?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve stuck here like a rock. Nothing\u2019s happened.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d Was he pleased, or disappointed? \u201cYou\u2019ve seen nothing at all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you have probably heard something? A big bump\u2014eh, _mon ami?_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it possible? Ah, but I am vexed with myself! I am not usually\r\nclumsy. I made but a slight gesture\u201d\u2014I know Poirot\u2019s gestures\u2014\u201cwith the\r\nleft hand, and over went the table by the bed!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked so childishly vexed and crest-fallen that I hastened to\r\nconsole him.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind, old chap. What does it matter? Your triumph downstairs\r\nexcited you. I can tell you, that was a surprise to us all. There must\r\nbe more in this affair of Inglethorp\u2019s with Mrs. Raikes than we\r\nthought, to make him hold his tongue so persistently. What are you\r\ngoing to do now? Where are the Scotland Yard fellows?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGone down to interview the servants. I showed them all our exhibits. I\r\nam disappointed in Japp. He has no method!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHullo!\u201d I said, looking out of the window. \u201cHere\u2019s Dr. Bauerstein. I\r\nbelieve you\u2019re right about that man, Poirot. I don\u2019t like him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is clever,\u201d observed Poirot meditatively.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, clever as the devil! I must say I was overjoyed to see him in the\r\nplight he was in on Tuesday. You never saw such a spectacle!\u201d And I\r\ndescribed the doctor\u2019s adventure. \u201cHe looked a regular scarecrow!\r\nPlastered with mud from head to foot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou saw him, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Of course, he didn\u2019t want to come in\u2014it was just after dinner\u2014but\r\nMr. Inglethorp insisted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Poirot caught me violently by the shoulders. \u201cWas Dr.\r\nBauerstein here on Tuesday evening? Here? And you never told me? Why\r\ndid you not tell me? Why? Why?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe appeared to be in an absolute frenzy.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Poirot,\u201d I expostulated, \u201cI never thought it would interest\r\nyou. I didn\u2019t know it was of any importance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cImportance? It is of the first importance! So Dr. Bauerstein was here\r\non Tuesday night\u2014the night of the murder. Hastings, do you not see?\r\nThat alters everything\u2014everything!\u201d\r\n\r\nI had never seen him so upset. Loosening his hold of me, he\r\nmechanically straightened a pair of candlesticks, still murmuring to\r\nhimself: \u201cYes, that alters everything\u2014everything.\u201d\r\n\r\nSuddenly he seemed to come to a decision.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Allons!_\u201d he said. \u201cWe must act at once. Where is Mr. Cavendish?\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn was in the smoking-room. Poirot went straight to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Cavendish, I have some important business in Tadminster. A new\r\nclue. May I take your motor?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, of course. Do you mean at once?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you please.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn rang the bell, and ordered round the car. In another ten minutes,\r\nwe were racing down the park and along the high road to Tadminster.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Poirot,\u201d I remarked resignedly, \u201cperhaps you will tell me what\r\nall this is about?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, _mon ami_, a good deal you can guess for yourself. Of course you\r\nrealize that, now Mr. Inglethorp is out of it, the whole position is\r\ngreatly changed. We are face to face with an entirely new problem. We\r\nknow now that there is one person who did not buy the poison. We have\r\ncleared away the manufactured clues. Now for the real ones. I have\r\nascertained that anyone in the household, with the exception of Mrs.\r\nCavendish, who was playing tennis with you, could have personated Mr.\r\nInglethorp on Monday evening. In the same way, we have his statement\r\nthat he put the coffee down in the hall. No one took much notice of\r\nthat at the inquest\u2014but now it has a very different significance. We\r\nmust find out who did take that coffee to Mrs. Inglethorp eventually,\r\nor who passed through the hall whilst it was standing there. From your\r\naccount, there are only two people whom we can positively say did not\r\ngo near the coffee\u2014Mrs. Cavendish, and Mademoiselle Cynthia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that is so.\u201d I felt an inexpressible lightening of the heart.\r\nMary Cavendish could certainly not rest under suspicion.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn clearing Alfred Inglethorp,\u201d continued Poirot, \u201cI have been obliged\r\nto show my hand sooner than I intended. As long as I might be thought\r\nto be pursuing him, the criminal would be off his guard. Now, he will\r\nbe doubly careful. Yes\u2014doubly careful.\u201d He turned to me abruptly. \u201cTell\r\nme, Hastings, you yourself\u2014have you no suspicions of anybody?\u201d\r\n\r\nI hesitated. To tell the truth, an idea, wild and extravagant in\r\nitself, had once or twice that morning flashed through my brain. I had\r\nrejected it as absurd, nevertheless it persisted.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t call it a suspicion,\u201d I murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s so utterly\r\nfoolish.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome now,\u201d urged Poirot encouragingly. \u201cDo not fear. Speak your mind.\r\nYou should always pay attention to your instincts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell then,\u201d I blurted out, \u201cit\u2019s absurd\u2014but I suspect Miss Howard of\r\nnot telling all she knows!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Howard?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014you\u2019ll laugh at me\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. Why should I?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t help feeling,\u201d I continued blunderingly; \u201cthat we\u2019ve rather\r\nleft her out of the possible suspects, simply on the strength of her\r\nhaving been away from the place. But, after all, she was only fifteen\r\nmiles away. A car would do it in half an hour. Can we say positively\r\nthat she was away from Styles on the night of the murder?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, my friend,\u201d said Poirot unexpectedly, \u201cwe can. One of my first\r\nactions was to ring up the hospital where she was working.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I learnt that Miss Howard had been on afternoon duty on Tuesday,\r\nand that\u2014a convoy coming in unexpectedly\u2014she had kindly offered to\r\nremain on night duty, which offer was gratefully accepted. That\r\ndisposes of that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d I said, rather nonplussed. \u201cReally,\u201d I continued, \u201cit\u2019s her\r\nextraordinary vehemence against Inglethorp that started me off\r\nsuspecting her. I can\u2019t help feeling she\u2019d do anything against him. And\r\nI had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the\r\nwill. She might have burnt the new one, mistaking it for the earlier\r\none in his favour. She is so terribly bitter against him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou consider her vehemence unnatural?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cY\u2014es. She is so very violent. I wondered really whether she is quite\r\nsane on that point.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head energetically.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, you are on a wrong tack there. There is nothing weak-minded or\r\ndegenerate about Miss Howard. She is an excellent specimen of\r\nwell-balanced English beef and brawn. She is sanity itself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYet her hatred of Inglethorp seems almost a mania. My idea was\u2014a very\r\nridiculous one, no doubt\u2014that she had intended to poison him\u2014and that,\r\nin some way, Mrs. Inglethorp got hold of it by mistake. But I don\u2019t at\r\nall see how it could have been done. The whole thing is absurd and\r\nridiculous to the last degree.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStill you are right in one thing. It is always wise to suspect\r\neverybody until you can prove logically, and to your own satisfaction,\r\nthat they are innocent. Now, what reasons are there against Miss\r\nHoward\u2019s having deliberately poisoned Mrs. Inglethorp?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, she was devoted to her!\u201d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\u201cTcha! Tcha!\u201d cried Poirot irritably. \u201cYou argue like a child. If Miss\r\nHoward were capable of poisoning the old lady, she would be quite\r\nequally capable of simulating devotion. No, we must look elsewhere. You\r\nare perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against\r\nAlfred Inglethorp is too violent to be natural; but you are quite wrong\r\nin the deduction you draw from it. I have drawn my own deductions,\r\nwhich I believe to be correct, but I will not speak of them at\r\npresent.\u201d He paused a minute, then went on. \u201cNow, to my way of\r\nthinking, there is one insuperable objection to Miss Howard\u2019s being the\r\nmurderess.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that is?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat in no possible way could Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s death benefit Miss\r\nHoward. Now there is no murder without a motive.\u201d\r\n\r\nI reflected.\r\n\r\n\u201cCould not Mrs. Inglethorp have made a will in her favour?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you yourself suggested that possibility to Mr. Wells?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was for a reason. I did not want to mention the name of the\r\nperson who was actually in my mind. Miss Howard occupied very much the\r\nsame position, so I used her name instead.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStill, Mrs. Inglethorp might have done so. Why, that will, made on the\r\nafternoon of her death may\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Poirot\u2019s shake of the head was so energetic that I stopped.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, my friend. I have certain little ideas of my own about that will.\r\nBut I can tell you this much\u2014it was not in Miss Howard\u2019s favour.\u201d\r\n\r\nI accepted his assurance, though I did not really see how he could be\r\nso positive about the matter.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, with a sigh, \u201cwe will acquit Miss Howard, then. It is\r\npartly your fault that I ever came to suspect her. It was what you said\r\nabout her evidence at the inquest that set me off.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did I say about her evidence at the inquest?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you remember? When I cited her and John Cavendish as being above\r\nsuspicion?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh\u2014ah\u2014yes.\u201d He seemed a little confused, but recovered himself. \u201cBy\r\nthe way, Hastings, there is something I want you to do for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. What is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNext time you happen to be alone with Lawrence Cavendish, I want you\r\nto say this to him. \u2018I have a message for you, from Poirot. He says:\r\n\u201cFind the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace!\u201d\u2019 Nothing more.\r\nNothing less.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.\u2019 Is that\r\nright?\u201d I asked, much mystified.\r\n\r\n\u201cExcellent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what does it mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that I will leave you to find out. You have access to the facts.\r\nJust say that to him, and see what he says.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well\u2014but it\u2019s all extremely mysterious.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe were running into Tadminster now, and Poirot directed the car to the\r\n\u201cAnalytical Chemist.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot hopped down briskly, and went inside. In a few minutes he was\r\nback again.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is all my business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat were you doing there?\u201d I asked, in lively curiosity.\r\n\r\n\u201cI left something to be analysed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe sample of cocoa I took from the saucepan in the bedroom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut that has already been tested!\u201d I cried, stupefied. \u201cDr. Bauerstein\r\nhad it tested, and you yourself laughed at the possibility of there\r\nbeing strychnine in it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know Dr. Bauerstein had it tested,\u201d replied Poirot quietly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I have a fancy for having it analysed again, that is all.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd not another word on the subject could I drag out of him.\r\n\r\nThis proceeding of Poirot\u2019s, in respect of the cocoa, puzzled me\r\nintensely. I could see neither rhyme nor reason in it. However, my\r\nconfidence in him, which at one time had rather waned, was fully\r\nrestored since his belief in Alfred Inglethorp\u2019s innocence had been so\r\ntriumphantly vindicated.\r\n\r\nThe funeral of Mrs. Inglethorp took place the following day, and on\r\nMonday, as I came down to a late breakfast, John drew me aside, and\r\ninformed me that Mr. Inglethorp was leaving that morning, to take up\r\nhis quarters at the Stylites Arms until he should have completed his\r\nplans.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd really it\u2019s a great relief to think he\u2019s going, Hastings,\u201d\r\ncontinued my honest friend. \u201cIt was bad enough before, when we thought\r\nhe\u2019d done it, but I\u2019m hanged if it isn\u2019t worse now, when we all feel\r\nguilty for having been so down on the fellow. The fact is, we\u2019ve\r\ntreated him abominably. Of course, things did look black against him. I\r\ndon\u2019t see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we\r\ndid. Still, there it is, we were in the wrong, and now there\u2019s a\r\nbeastly feeling that one ought to make amends; which is difficult, when\r\none doesn\u2019t like the fellow a bit better than one did before. The whole\r\nthing\u2019s damned awkward! And I\u2019m thankful he\u2019s had the tact to take\r\nhimself off. It\u2019s a good thing Styles wasn\u2019t the mater\u2019s to leave to\r\nhim. Couldn\u2019t bear to think of the fellow lording it here. He\u2019s welcome\r\nto her money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to keep up the place all right?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes. There are the death duties, of course, but half my father\u2019s\r\nmoney goes with the place, and Lawrence will stay with us for the\r\npresent, so there is his share as well. We shall be pinched at first,\r\nof course, because, as I once told you, I am in a bit of a hole\r\nfinancially myself. Still, the Johnnies will wait now.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the general relief at Inglethorp\u2019s approaching departure, we had the\r\nmost genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy. Cynthia,\r\nwhose young spirits were naturally buoyant, was looking quite her\r\npretty self again, and we all, with the exception of Lawrence, who\r\nseemed unalterably gloomy and nervous, were quietly cheerful, at the\r\nopening of a new and hopeful future.\r\n\r\nThe papers, of course, had been full of the tragedy. Glaring headlines,\r\nsandwiched biographies of every member of the household, subtle\r\ninnuendoes, the usual familiar tag about the police having a clue.\r\nNothing was spared us. It was a slack time. The war was momentarily\r\ninactive, and the newspapers seized with avidity on this crime in\r\nfashionable life: \u201cThe Mysterious Affair at Styles\u201d was the topic of\r\nthe moment.\r\n\r\nNaturally it was very annoying for the Cavendishes. The house was\r\nconstantly besieged by reporters, who were consistently denied\r\nadmission, but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds,\r\nwhere they lay in wait with cameras, for any unwary members of the\r\nhousehold. We all lived in a blast of publicity. The Scotland Yard men\r\ncame and went, examining, questioning, lynx-eyed and reserved of\r\ntongue. Towards what end they were working, we did not know. Had they\r\nany clue, or would the whole thing remain in the category of\r\nundiscovered crimes?\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, Dorcas came up to me rather mysteriously, and asked if\r\nshe might have a few words with me.\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. What is it, Dorcas?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s just this, sir. You\u2019ll be seeing the Belgian gentleman\r\nto-day perhaps?\u201d I nodded. \u201cWell, sir, you know how he asked me so\r\nparticular if the mistress, or anyone else, had a green dress?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes. You have found one?\u201d My interest was aroused.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, not that, sir. But since then I\u2019ve remembered what the young\r\ngentlemen\u201d\u2014John and Lawrence were still the \u201cyoung gentlemen\u201d to\r\nDorcas\u2014\u201ccall the \u2018dressing-up box.\u2019 It\u2019s up in the front attic, sir. A\r\ngreat chest, full of old clothes and fancy dresses, and what not. And\r\nit came to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst\r\nthem. So, if you\u2019d tell the Belgian gentleman\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will tell him, Dorcas,\u201d I promised.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you very much, sir. A very nice gentleman he is, sir. And quite\r\na different class from them two detectives from London, what goes\r\nprying about, and asking questions. I don\u2019t hold with foreigners as a\r\nrule, but from what the newspapers say I make out as how these brave\r\nBelges isn\u2019t the ordinary run of foreigners, and certainly he\u2019s a most\r\npolite spoken gentleman.\u201d\r\n\r\nDear old Dorcas! As she stood there, with her honest face upturned to\r\nmine, I thought what a fine specimen she was of the old-fashioned\r\nservant that is so fast dying out.\r\n\r\nI thought I might as well go down to the village at once, and look up\r\nPoirot; but I met him half-way, coming up to the house, and at once\r\ngave him Dorcas\u2019s message.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, the brave Dorcas! We will look at the chest, although\u2014but no\r\nmatter\u2014we will examine it all the same.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe entered the house by one of the windows. There was no one in the\r\nhall, and we went straight up to the attic.\r\n\r\nSure enough, there was the chest, a fine old piece, all studded with\r\nbrass nails, and full to overflowing with every imaginable type of\r\ngarment.\r\n\r\nPoirot bundled everything out on the floor with scant ceremony. There\r\nwere one or two green fabrics of varying shades; but Poirot shook his\r\nhead over them all. He seemed somewhat apathetic in the search, as\r\nthough he expected no great results from it. Suddenly he gave an\r\nexclamation.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLook!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe chest was nearly empty, and there, reposing right at the bottom,\r\nwas a magnificent black beard.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Oh\u00f3!_\u201d said Poirot. \u201c_Oh\u00f3!_\u201d He turned it over in his hands,\r\nexamining it closely. \u201cNew,\u201d he remarked. \u201cYes, quite new.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\u2019s hesitation, he replaced it in the chest, heaped all\r\nthe other things on top of it as before, and made his way briskly\r\ndownstairs. He went straight to the pantry, where we found Dorcas\r\nbusily polishing her silver.\r\n\r\nPoirot wished her good morning with Gallic politeness, and went on:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have been looking through that chest, Dorcas. I am much obliged to\r\nyou for mentioning it. There is, indeed, a fine collection there. Are\r\nthey often used, may I ask?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, sir, not very often nowadays, though from time to time we do\r\nhave what the young gentlemen call \u2018a dress-up night.\u2019 And very funny\r\nit is sometimes, sir. Mr. Lawrence, he\u2019s wonderful. Most comic! I shall\r\nnever forget the night he came down as the Char of Persia, I think he\r\ncalled it\u2014a sort of Eastern King it was. He had the big paper knife in\r\nhis hand, and \u2018Mind, Dorcas,\u2019 he says, \u2018you\u2019ll have to be very\r\nrespectful. This is my specially sharpened scimitar, and it\u2019s off with\r\nyour head if I\u2019m at all displeased with you!\u2019 Miss Cynthia, she was\r\nwhat they call an Apache, or some such name\u2014a Frenchified sort of\r\ncut-throat, I take it to be. A real sight she looked. You\u2019d never have\r\nbelieved a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into\r\nsuch a ruffian. Nobody would have known her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThese evenings must have been great fun,\u201d said Poirot genially. \u201cI\r\nsuppose Mr. Lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs,\r\nwhen he was Shah of Persia?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe did have a beard, sir,\u201d replied Dorcas, smiling. \u201cAnd well I know\r\nit, for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with! And\r\nI\u2019m sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance. I didn\u2019t know as\r\nthere was a beard up there at all. It must have been got quite lately,\r\nI think. There was a red wig, I know, but nothing else in the way of\r\nhair. Burnt corks they use mostly\u2014though \u2018tis messy getting it off\r\nagain. Miss Cynthia was a nigger once, and, oh, the trouble she had.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo Dorcas knows nothing about that black beard,\u201d said Poirot\r\nthoughtfully, as we walked out into the hall again.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you think it is _the_ one?\u201d I whispered eagerly.\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do. You notice it had been trimmed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. It was cut exactly the shape of Mr. Inglethorp\u2019s, and I found one\r\nor two snipped hairs. Hastings, this affair is very deep.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho put it in the chest, I wonder?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSomeone with a good deal of intelligence,\u201d remarked Poirot dryly. \u201cYou\r\nrealize that he chose the one place in the house to hide it where its\r\npresence would not be remarked? Yes, he is intelligent. But we must be\r\nmore intelligent. We must be so intelligent that he does not suspect us\r\nof being intelligent at all.\u201d\r\n\r\nI acquiesced.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, _mon ami_, you will be of great assistance to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was pleased with the compliment. There had been times when I hardly\r\nthought that Poirot appreciated me at my true worth.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he continued, staring at me thoughtfully, \u201cyou will be\r\ninvaluable.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was naturally gratifying, but Poirot\u2019s next words were not so\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must have an ally in the house,\u201d he observed reflectively.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have me,\u201d I protested.\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue, but you are not sufficient.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was hurt, and showed it. Poirot hurried to explain himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do not quite take my meaning. You are known to be working with me.\r\nI want somebody who is not associated with us in any way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I see. How about John?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I think not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe dear fellow isn\u2019t perhaps very bright,\u201d I said thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere comes Miss Howard,\u201d said Poirot suddenly. \u201cShe is the very\r\nperson. But I am in her black books, since I cleared Mr. Inglethorp.\r\nStill, we can but try.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a nod that was barely civil, Miss Howard assented to Poirot\u2019s\r\nrequest for a few minutes\u2019 conversation.\r\n\r\nWe went into the little morning-room, and Poirot closed the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Monsieur Poirot,\u201d said Miss Howard impatiently, \u201cwhat is it? Out\r\nwith it. I\u2019m busy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you remember, mademoiselle, that I once asked you to help me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I do.\u201d The lady nodded. \u201cAnd I told you I\u2019d help you with\r\npleasure\u2014to hang Alfred Inglethorp.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d Poirot studied her seriously. \u201cMiss Howard, I will ask you one\r\nquestion. I beg of you to reply to it truthfully.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever tell lies,\u201d replied Miss Howard.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is this. Do you still believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by\r\nher husband?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked sharply. \u201cYou needn\u2019t think your pretty\r\nexplanations influence me in the slightest. I\u2019ll admit that it wasn\u2019t\r\nhe who bought strychnine at the chemist\u2019s shop. What of that? I dare\r\nsay he soaked fly paper, as I told you at the beginning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is arsenic\u2014not strychnine,\u201d said Poirot mildly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat does that matter? Arsenic would put poor Emily out of the way\r\njust as well as strychnine. If I\u2019m convinced he did it, it doesn\u2019t\r\nmatter a jot to me _how_ he did it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. _If_ you are convinced he did it,\u201d said Poirot quietly. \u201cI\r\nwill put my question in another form. Did you ever in your heart of\r\nhearts believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by her husband?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d cried Miss Howard. \u201cHaven\u2019t I always told you the man\r\nis a villain? Haven\u2019t I always told you he would murder her in her bed?\r\nHaven\u2019t I always hated him like poison?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Poirot. \u201cThat bears out my little idea entirely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat little idea?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Howard, do you remember a conversation that took place on the day\r\nof my friend\u2019s arrival here? He repeated it to me, and there is a\r\nsentence of yours that has impressed me very much. Do you remember\r\naffirming that if a crime had been committed, and anyone you loved had\r\nbeen murdered, you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the\r\ncriminal was, even if you were quite unable to prove it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I remember saying that. I believe it too. I suppose you think it\r\nnonsense?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet you will pay no attention to my instinct against Alfred\r\nInglethorp.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Poirot curtly. \u201cBecause your instinct is not against Mr.\r\nInglethorp.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. You wish to believe he committed the crime. You believe him\r\ncapable of committing it. But your instinct tells you he did not commit\r\nit. It tells you more\u2014shall I go on?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was staring at him, fascinated, and made a slight affirmative\r\nmovement of the hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cShall I tell you why you have been so vehement against Mr. Inglethorp?\r\nIt is because you have been trying to believe what you wish to believe.\r\nIt is because you are trying to drown and stifle your instinct, which\r\ntells you another name\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d cried Miss Howard wildly, flinging up her hands. \u201cDon\u2019t\r\nsay it! Oh, don\u2019t say it! It isn\u2019t true! It can\u2019t be true. I don\u2019t know\r\nwhat put such a wild\u2014such a dreadful\u2014idea into my head!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am right, am I not?\u201d asked Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes; you must be a wizard to have guessed. But it can\u2019t be\r\nso\u2014it\u2019s too monstrous, too impossible. It _must_ be Alfred Inglethorp.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask me about it,\u201d continued Miss Howard, \u201cbecause I shan\u2019t tell\r\nyou. I won\u2019t admit it, even to myself. I must be mad to think of such a\r\nthing.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded, as if satisfied.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will ask you nothing. It is enough for me that it is as I thought.\r\nAnd I\u2014I, too, have an instinct. We are working together towards a\r\ncommon end.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask me to help you, because I won\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t lift a finger\r\nto\u2014to\u2014\u2014\u201d She faltered.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will help me in spite of yourself. I ask you nothing\u2014but you will\r\nbe my ally. You will not be able to help yourself. You will do the only\r\nthing that I want of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that is?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will watch!\u201d\r\n\r\nEvelyn Howard bowed her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I can\u2019t help doing that. I am always watching\u2014always hoping I\r\nshall be proved wrong.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we are wrong, well and good,\u201d said Poirot. \u201cNo one will be more\r\npleased than I shall. But, if we are right? If we are right, Miss\r\nHoward, on whose side are you then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt could be hushed up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere must be no hushing up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut Emily herself\u2014\u2014\u201d She broke off.\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Howard,\u201d said Poirot gravely, \u201cthis is unworthy of you.\u201d\r\n\r\nSuddenly she took her face from her hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cthat was not Evelyn Howard who spoke!\u201d She\r\nflung her head up proudly. \u201c_This_ is Evelyn Howard! And she is on the\r\nside of Justice! Let the cost be what it may.\u201d And with these words,\r\nshe walked firmly out of the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d said Poirot, looking after her, \u201cgoes a very valuable ally.\r\nThat woman, Hastings, has got brains as well as a heart.\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not reply.\r\n\r\n\u201cInstinct is a marvellous thing,\u201d mused Poirot. \u201cIt can neither be\r\nexplained nor ignored.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou and Miss Howard seem to know what you are talking about,\u201d I\r\nobserved coldly. \u201cPerhaps you don\u2019t realize that _I_ am still in the\r\ndark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally? Is that so, _mon ami?_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Enlighten me, will you?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot studied me attentively for a moment or two. Then, to my intense\r\nsurprise, he shook his head decidedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, my friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, look here, why not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo is enough for a secret.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I think it is very unfair to keep back facts from me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am not keeping back facts. Every fact that I know is in your\r\npossession. You can draw your own deductions from them. This time it is\r\na question of ideas.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStill, it would be interesting to know.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot looked at me very earnestly, and again shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d he said sadly, \u201c_you_ have no instincts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was intelligence you were requiring just now,\u201d I pointed out.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe two often go together,\u201d said Poirot enigmatically.\r\n\r\nThe remark seemed so utterly irrelevant that I did not even take the\r\ntrouble to answer it. But I decided that if I made any interesting and\r\nimportant discoveries\u2014as no doubt I should\u2014I would keep them to myself,\r\nand surprise Poirot with the ultimate result.\r\n\r\nThere are times when it is one\u2019s duty to assert oneself.\r\n\nI had had no opportunity as yet of passing on Poirot\u2019s message to\r\nLawrence. But now, as I strolled out on the lawn, still nursing a\r\ngrudge against my friend\u2019s high-handedness, I saw Lawrence on the\r\ncroquet lawn, aimlessly knocking a couple of very ancient balls about,\r\nwith a still more ancient mallet.\r\n\r\nIt struck me that it would be a good opportunity to deliver my message.\r\nOtherwise, Poirot himself might relieve me of it. It was true that I\r\ndid not quite gather its purport, but I flattered myself that by\r\nLawrence\u2019s reply, and perhaps a little skillful cross-examination on my\r\npart, I should soon perceive its significance. Accordingly I accosted\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you,\u201d I remarked untruthfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. The truth is, I\u2019ve got a message for you\u2014from Poirot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe told me to wait until I was alone with you,\u201d I said, dropping my\r\nvoice significantly, and watching him intently out of the corner of my\r\neye. I have always been rather good at what is called, I believe,\r\ncreating an atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was no change of expression in the dark melancholic face. Had he\r\nany idea of what I was about to say?\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the message.\u201d I dropped my voice still lower. \u201c\u2018Find the extra\r\ncoffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat on earth does he mean?\u201d Lawrence stared at me in quite unaffected\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot in the least. Do you?\u201d\r\n\r\nI was compelled to shake my head.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat extra coffee-cup?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019d better ask Dorcas, or one of the maids, if he wants to know about\r\ncoffee-cups. It\u2019s their business, not mine. I don\u2019t know anything about\r\nthe coffee-cups, except that we\u2019ve got some that are never used, which\r\nare a perfect dream! Old Worcester. You\u2019re not a connoisseur, are you,\r\nHastings?\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou miss a lot. A really perfect bit of old china\u2014it\u2019s pure delight to\r\nhandle it, or even to look at it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what am I to tell Poirot?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTell him I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. It\u2019s double Dutch to\r\nme.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was moving off towards the house again when he suddenly called me\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\u201cI say, what was the end of that message? Say it over again, will you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.\u2019 Are you sure\r\nyou don\u2019t know what it means?\u201d I asked him earnestly.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said musingly, \u201cI don\u2019t. I\u2014I wish I did.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boom of the gong sounded from the house, and we went in together.\r\nPoirot had been asked by John to remain to lunch, and was already\r\nseated at the table.\r\n\r\nBy tacit consent, all mention of the tragedy was barred. We conversed\r\non the war, and other outside topics. But after the cheese and biscuits\r\nhad been handed round, and Dorcas had left the room, Poirot suddenly\r\nleant forward to Mrs. Cavendish.\r\n\r\n\u201cPardon me, madame, for recalling unpleasant memories, but I have a\r\nlittle idea\u201d\u2014Poirot\u2019s \u201clittle ideas\u201d were becoming a perfect\r\nbyword\u2014\u201cand would like to ask one or two questions.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf me? Certainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are too amiable, madame. What I want to ask is this: the door\r\nleading into Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s room from that of Mademoiselle Cynthia,\r\nit was bolted, you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly it was bolted,\u201d replied Mary Cavendish, rather surprised. \u201cI\r\nsaid so at the inquest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBolted?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d She looked perplexed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI mean,\u201d explained Poirot, \u201cyou are sure it was bolted, and not merely\r\nlocked?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I see what you mean. No, I don\u2019t know. I said bolted, meaning that\r\nit was fastened, and I could not open it, but I believe all the doors\r\nwere found bolted on the inside.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStill, as far as you are concerned, the door might equally well have\r\nbeen locked?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou yourself did not happen to notice, madame, when you entered Mrs.\r\nInglethorp\u2019s room, whether that door was bolted or not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2014I believe it was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you did not see it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. I\u2014never looked.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut _I_ did,\u201d interrupted Lawrence suddenly. \u201cI happened to notice\r\nthat it _was_ bolted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that settles it.\u201d And Poirot looked crestfallen.\r\n\r\nI could not help rejoicing that, for once, one of his \u201clittle ideas\u201d\r\nhad come to naught.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch Poirot begged me to accompany him home. I consented rather\r\nstiffly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are annoyed, is it not so?\u201d he asked anxiously, as we walked\r\nthrough the park.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d I said coldly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is well. That lifts a great load from my mind.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was not quite what I had intended. I had hoped that he would have\r\nobserved the stiffness of my manner. Still, the fervour of his words\r\nwent towards the appeasing of my just displeasure. I thawed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI gave Lawrence your message,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what did he say? He was entirely puzzled?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I am quite sure he had no idea of what you meant.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had expected Poirot to be disappointed; but, to my surprise, he\r\nreplied that that was as he had thought, and that he was very glad. My\r\npride forbade me to ask any questions.\r\n\r\nPoirot switched off on another tack.\r\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle Cynthia was not at lunch to-day? How was that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is at the hospital again. She resumed work to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, she is an industrious little demoiselle. And pretty too. She is\r\nlike pictures I have seen in Italy. I would rather like to see that\r\ndispensary of hers. Do you think she would show it to me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure she would be delighted. It\u2019s an interesting little place.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes she go there every day?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe has all Wednesdays off, and comes back to lunch on Saturdays.\r\nThose are her only times off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will remember. Women are doing great work nowadays, and Mademoiselle\r\nCynthia is clever\u2014oh, yes, she has brains, that little one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I believe she has passed quite a stiff exam.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWithout doubt. After all, it is very responsible work. I suppose they\r\nhave very strong poisons there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, she showed them to us. They are kept locked up in a little\r\ncupboard. I believe they have to be very careful. They always take out\r\nthe key before leaving the room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed. It is near the window, this cupboard?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, right the other side of the room. Why?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wondered. That is all. Will you come in?\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had reached the cottage.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. I think I\u2019ll be getting back. I shall go round the long way\r\nthrough the woods.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe woods round Styles were very beautiful. After the walk across the\r\nopen park, it was pleasant to saunter lazily through the cool glades.\r\nThere was hardly a breath of wind, the very chirp of the birds was\r\nfaint and subdued. I strolled on a little way, and finally flung myself\r\ndown at the foot of a grand old beech-tree. My thoughts of mankind were\r\nkindly and charitable. I even forgave Poirot for his absurd secrecy. In\r\nfact, I was at peace with the world. Then I yawned.\r\n\r\nI thought about the crime, and it struck me as being very unreal and\r\nfar off.\r\n\r\nI yawned again.\r\n\r\nProbably, I thought, it really never happened. Of course, it was all a\r\nbad dream. The truth of the matter was that it was Lawrence who had\r\nmurdered Alfred Inglethorp with a croquet mallet. But it was absurd of\r\nJohn to make such a fuss about it, and to go shouting out: \u201cI tell you\r\nI won\u2019t have it!\u201d\r\n\r\nI woke up with a start.\r\n\r\nAt once I realized that I was in a very awkward predicament. For, about\r\ntwelve feet away from me, John and Mary Cavendish were standing facing\r\neach other, and they were evidently quarrelling. And, quite as\r\nevidently, they were unaware of my vicinity, for before I could move or\r\nspeak John repeated the words which had aroused me from my dream.\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you, Mary, I won\u2019t have it.\u201d\r\n\r\nMary\u2019s voice came, cool and liquid:\r\n\r\n\u201cHave _you_ any right to criticize my actions?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will be the talk of the village! My mother was only buried on\r\nSaturday, and here you are gadding about with the fellow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d she shrugged her shoulders, \u201cif it is only village gossip that\r\nyou mind!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it isn\u2019t. I\u2019ve had enough of the fellow hanging about. He\u2019s a\r\nPolish Jew, anyway.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA tinge of Jewish blood is not a bad thing. It leavens the\u201d\u2014she looked\r\nat him\u2014\u201cstolid stupidity of the ordinary Englishman.\u201d\r\n\r\nFire in her eyes, ice in her voice. I did not wonder that the blood\r\nrose to John\u2019s face in a crimson tide.\r\n\r\n\u201cMary!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d Her tone did not change.\r\n\r\nThe pleading died out of his voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cAm I to understand that you will continue to see Bauerstein against my\r\nexpress wishes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I choose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou defy me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but I deny your right to criticize my actions. Have _you_ no\r\nfriends of whom I should disapprove?\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn fell back a pace. The colour ebbed slowly from his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he said, in an unsteady voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see!\u201d said Mary quietly. \u201cYou _do_ see, don\u2019t you, that _you_ have\r\nno right to dictate to _me_ as to the choice of my friends?\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn glanced at her pleadingly, a stricken look on his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo right? Have I _no_ right, Mary?\u201d he said unsteadily. He stretched\r\nout his hands. \u201cMary\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment, I thought she wavered. A softer expression came over her\r\nface, then suddenly she turned almost fiercely away.\r\n\r\n\u201cNone!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was walking away when John sprang after her, and caught her by the\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\u201cMary\u201d\u2014his voice was very quiet now\u2014\u201care you in love with this fellow\r\nBauerstein?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, and suddenly there swept across her face a strange\r\nexpression, old as the hills, yet with something eternally young about\r\nit. So might some Egyptian sphinx have smiled.\r\n\r\nShe freed herself quietly from his arm, and spoke over her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she said; and then swiftly passed out of the little glade,\r\nleaving John standing there as though he had been turned to stone.\r\n\r\nRather ostentatiously, I stepped forward, crackling some dead branches\r\nwith my feet as I did so. John turned. Luckily, he took it for granted\r\nthat I had only just come upon the scene.\r\n\r\n\u201cHullo, Hastings. Have you seen the little fellow safely back to his\r\ncottage? Quaint little chap! Is he any good, though, really?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was considered one of the finest detectives of his day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, well, I suppose there must be something in it, then. What a rotten\r\nworld it is, though!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou find it so?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood Lord, yes! There\u2019s this terrible business to start with. Scotland\r\nYard men in and out of the house like a jack-in-the-box! Never know\r\nwhere they won\u2019t turn up next. Screaming headlines in every paper in\r\nthe country\u2014damn all journalists, I say! Do you know there was a whole\r\ncrowd staring in at the lodge gates this morning. Sort of Madame\r\nTussaud\u2019s chamber of horrors business that can be seen for nothing.\r\nPretty thick, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCheer up, John!\u201d I said soothingly. \u201cIt can\u2019t last for ever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t it, though? It can last long enough for us never to be able to\r\nhold up our heads again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, you\u2019re getting morbid on the subject.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEnough to make a man morbid, to be stalked by beastly journalists and\r\nstared at by gaping moon-faced idiots, wherever he goes! But there\u2019s\r\nworse than that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn lowered his voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you ever thought, Hastings\u2014it\u2019s a nightmare to me\u2014who did it? I\r\ncan\u2019t help feeling sometimes it must have been an accident.\r\nBecause\u2014because\u2014who could have done it? Now Inglethorp\u2019s out of the\r\nway, there\u2019s no one else; no one, I mean, except\u2014one of us.\u201d\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, that was nightmare enough for any man! One of us? Yes,\r\nsurely it must be so, unless\u2014\u2014-\r\n\r\nA new idea suggested itself to my mind. Rapidly, I considered it. The\r\nlight increased. Poirot\u2019s mysterious doings, his hints\u2014they all fitted\r\nin. Fool that I was not to have thought of this possibility before, and\r\nwhat a relief for us all.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, John,\u201d I said, \u201cit isn\u2019t one of us. How could it be?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know, but, still, who else is there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you guess?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked cautiously round, and lowered my voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Bauerstein!\u201d I whispered.\r\n\r\n\u201cImpossible!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what earthly interest could he have in my mother\u2019s death?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat I don\u2019t see,\u201d I confessed, \u201cbut I\u2019ll tell you this: Poirot thinks\r\nso.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot? Does he? How do you know?\u201d\r\n\r\nI told him of Poirot\u2019s intense excitement on hearing that Dr.\r\nBauerstein had been at Styles on the fatal night, and added:\r\n\r\n\u201cHe said twice: \u2018That alters everything.\u2019 And I\u2019ve been thinking. You\r\nknow Inglethorp said he had put down the coffee in the hall? Well, it\r\nwas just then that Bauerstein arrived. Isn\u2019t it possible that, as\r\nInglethorp brought him through the hall, the doctor dropped something\r\ninto the coffee in passing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cH\u2019m,\u201d said John. \u201cIt would have been very risky.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but it was possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then, how could he know it was her coffee? No, old fellow, I don\u2019t\r\nthink that will wash.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut I had remembered something else.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite right. That wasn\u2019t how it was done. Listen.\u201d And I then\r\ntold him of the cocoa sample which Poirot had taken to be analysed.\r\n\r\nJohn interrupted just as I had done.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, look here, Bauerstein had had it analysed already?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes, that\u2019s the point. I didn\u2019t see it either until now. Don\u2019t\r\nyou understand? Bauerstein had it analysed\u2014that\u2019s just it! If\r\nBauerstein\u2019s the murderer, nothing could be simpler than for him to\r\nsubstitute some ordinary cocoa for his sample, and send that to be\r\ntested. And of course they would find no strychnine! But no one would\r\ndream of suspecting Bauerstein, or think of taking another\r\nsample\u2014except Poirot,\u201d I added, with belated recognition.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but what about the bitter taste that cocoa won\u2019t disguise?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ve only his word for that. And there are other possibilities.\r\nHe\u2019s admittedly one of the world\u2019s greatest toxicologists\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of the world\u2019s greatest what? Say it again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe knows more about poisons than almost anybody,\u201d I explained. \u201cWell,\r\nmy idea is, that perhaps he\u2019s found some way of making strychnine\r\ntasteless. Or it may not have been strychnine at all, but some obscure\r\ndrug no one has ever heard of, which produces much the same symptoms.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cH\u2019m, yes, that might be,\u201d said John. \u201cBut look here, how could he have\r\ngot at the cocoa? That wasn\u2019t downstairs?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t,\u201d I admitted reluctantly.\r\n\r\nAnd then, suddenly, a dreadful possibility flashed through my mind. I\r\nhoped and prayed it would not occur to John also. I glanced sideways at\r\nhim. He was frowning perplexedly, and I drew a deep breath of relief,\r\nfor the terrible thought that had flashed across my mind was this: that\r\nDr. Bauerstein might have had an accomplice.\r\n\r\nYet surely it could not be! Surely no woman as beautiful as Mary\r\nCavendish could be a murderess. Yet beautiful women had been known to\r\npoison.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly I remembered that first conversation at tea on the day of\r\nmy arrival, and the gleam in her eyes as she had said that poison was a\r\nwoman\u2019s weapon. How agitated she had been on that fatal Tuesday\r\nevening! Had Mrs. Inglethorp discovered something between her and\r\nBauerstein, and threatened to tell her husband? Was it to stop that\r\ndenunciation that the crime had been committed?\r\n\r\nThen I remembered that enigmatical conversation between Poirot and\r\nEvelyn Howard. Was this what they had meant? Was this the monstrous\r\npossibility that Evelyn had tried not to believe?\r\n\r\nYes, it all fitted in.\r\n\r\nNo wonder Miss Howard had suggested \u201chushing it up.\u201d Now I understood\r\nthat unfinished sentence of hers: \u201cEmily herself\u2014\u2014\u201d And in my heart I\r\nagreed with her. Would not Mrs. Inglethorp have preferred to go\r\nunavenged rather than have such terrible dishonour fall upon the name\r\nof Cavendish.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s another thing,\u201d said John suddenly, and the unexpected sound\r\nof his voice made me start guiltily. \u201cSomething which makes me doubt if\r\nwhat you say can be true.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked, thankful that he had gone away from the subject\r\nof how the poison could have been introduced into the cocoa.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, the fact that Bauerstein demanded a post-mortem. He needn\u2019t have\r\ndone so. Little Wilkins would have been quite content to let it go at\r\nheart disease.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said doubtfully. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know. Perhaps he thought it\r\nsafer in the long run. Someone might have talked afterwards. Then the\r\nHome Office might have ordered exhumation. The whole thing would have\r\ncome out, then, and he would have been in an awkward position, for no\r\none would have believed that a man of his reputation could have been\r\ndeceived into calling it heart disease.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s possible,\u201d admitted John. \u201cStill,\u201d he added, \u201cI\u2019m blest if\r\nI can see what his motive could have been.\u201d\r\n\r\nI trembled.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here,\u201d I said, \u201cI may be altogether wrong. And, remember, all\r\nthis is in confidence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, of course\u2014that goes without saying.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had walked, as we talked, and now we passed through the little gate\r\ninto the garden. Voices rose near at hand, for tea was spread out under\r\nthe sycamore-tree, as it had been on the day of my arrival.\r\n\r\nCynthia was back from the hospital, and I placed my chair beside her,\r\nand told her of Poirot\u2019s wish to visit the dispensary.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course! I\u2019d love him to see it. He\u2019d better come to tea there one\r\nday. I must fix it up with him. He\u2019s such a dear little man! But he\r\n_is_ funny. He made me take the brooch out of my tie the other day, and\r\nput it in again, because he said it wasn\u2019t straight.\u201d\r\n\r\nI laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a mania with him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\r\n\r\nWe were silent for a minute or two, and then, glancing in the direction\r\nof Mary Cavendish, and dropping her voice, Cynthia said:\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Hastings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter tea, I want to talk to you.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer glance at Mary had set me thinking. I fancied that between these\r\ntwo there existed very little sympathy. For the first time, it occurred\r\nto me to wonder about the girl\u2019s future. Mrs. Inglethorp had made no\r\nprovisions of any kind for her, but I imagined that John and Mary would\r\nprobably insist on her making her home with them\u2014at any rate until the\r\nend of the war. John, I knew, was very fond of her, and would be sorry\r\nto let her go.\r\n\r\nJohn, who had gone into the house, now reappeared. His good-natured\r\nface wore an unaccustomed frown of anger.\r\n\r\n\u201cConfound those detectives! I can\u2019t think what they\u2019re after! They\u2019ve\r\nbeen in every room in the house\u2014turning things inside out, and upside\r\ndown. It really is too bad! I suppose they took advantage of our all\r\nbeing out. I shall go for that fellow Japp, when I next see him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLot of Paul Prys,\u201d grunted Miss Howard.\r\n\r\nLawrence opined that they had to make a show of doing something.\r\n\r\nMary Cavendish said nothing.\r\n\r\nAfter tea, I invited Cynthia to come for a walk, and we sauntered off\r\ninto the woods together.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d I inquired, as soon as we were protected from prying eyes by\r\nthe leafy screen.\r\n\r\nWith a sigh, Cynthia flung herself down, and tossed off her hat. The\r\nsunlight, piercing through the branches, turned the auburn of her hair\r\nto quivering gold.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Hastings\u2014you are always so kind, and you know such a lot.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt struck me at this moment that Cynthia was really a very charming\r\ngirl! Much more charming than Mary, who never said things of that kind.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d I asked benignantly, as she hesitated.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to ask your advice. What shall I do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. You see, Aunt Emily always told me I should be provided for. I\r\nsuppose she forgot, or didn\u2019t think she was likely to die\u2014anyway, I am\r\n_not_ provided for! And I don\u2019t know what to do. Do you think I ought\r\nto go away from here at once?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens, no! They don\u2019t want to part with you, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\r\n\r\nCynthia hesitated a moment, plucking up the grass with her tiny hands.\r\nThen she said: \u201cMrs. Cavendish does. She hates me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHates you?\u201d I cried, astonished.\r\n\r\nCynthia nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I don\u2019t know why, but she can\u2019t bear me; and _he_ can\u2019t, either.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere I know you\u2019re wrong,\u201d I said warmly. \u201cOn the contrary, John is\r\nvery fond of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes\u2014_John_. I meant Lawrence. Not, of course, that I care whether\r\nLawrence hates me or not. Still, it\u2019s rather horrid when no one loves\r\nyou, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut they do, Cynthia dear,\u201d I said earnestly. \u201cI\u2019m sure you are\r\nmistaken. Look, there is John\u2014and Miss Howard\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nCynthia nodded rather gloomily. \u201cYes, John likes me, I think, and of\r\ncourse Evie, for all her gruff ways, wouldn\u2019t be unkind to a fly. But\r\nLawrence never speaks to me if he can help it, and Mary can hardly\r\nbring herself to be civil to me. She wants Evie to stay on, is begging\r\nher to, but she doesn\u2019t want me, and\u2014and\u2014I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\r\nSuddenly the poor child burst out crying.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know what possessed me. Her beauty, perhaps, as she sat there,\r\nwith the sunlight glinting down on her head; perhaps the sense of\r\nrelief at encountering someone who so obviously could have no\r\nconnection with the tragedy; perhaps honest pity for her youth and\r\nloneliness. Anyway, I leant forward, and taking her little hand, I said\r\nawkwardly:\r\n\r\n\u201cMarry me, Cynthia.\u201d\r\n\r\nUnwittingly, I had hit upon a sovereign remedy for her tears. She sat\r\nup at once, drew her hand away, and said, with some asperity:\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly!\u201d\r\n\r\nI was a little annoyed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not being silly. I am asking you to do me the honour of becoming\r\nmy wife.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo my intense surprise, Cynthia burst out laughing, and called me a\r\n\u201cfunny dear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly sweet of you,\u201d she said, \u201cbut you know you don\u2019t want\r\nto!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I do. I\u2019ve got\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind what you\u2019ve got. You don\u2019t really want to\u2014and I don\u2019t\r\neither.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, of course, that settles it,\u201d I said stiffly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see\r\nanything to laugh at. There\u2019s nothing funny about a proposal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed,\u201d said Cynthia. \u201cSomebody might accept you next time.\r\nGood-bye, you\u2019ve cheered me up _very_ much.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd, with a final uncontrollable burst of merriment, she vanished\r\nthrough the trees.\r\n\r\nThinking over the interview, it struck me as being profoundly\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me suddenly that I would go down to the village, and\r\nlook up Bauerstein. Somebody ought to be keeping an eye on the fellow.\r\nAt the same time, it would be wise to allay any suspicions he might\r\nhave as to his being suspected. I remembered how Poirot had relied on\r\nmy diplomacy. Accordingly, I went to the little house with the\r\n\u201cApartments\u201d card inserted in the window, where I knew he lodged, and\r\ntapped on the door.\r\n\r\nAn old woman came and opened it.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d I said pleasantly. \u201cIs Dr. Bauerstein in?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stared at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHeard what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s took.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTook? Dead?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, took by the perlice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the police!\u201d I gasped. \u201cDo you mean they\u2019ve arrested him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s it, and\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nI waited to hear no more, but tore up the village to find Poirot.\r\n\nTo my extreme annoyance, Poirot was not in, and the old Belgian who\r\nanswered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to London.\r\n\r\nI was dumbfounded. What on earth could Poirot be doing in London! Was\r\nit a sudden decision on his part, or had he already made up his mind\r\nwhen he parted from me a few hours earlier?\r\n\r\nI retraced my steps to Styles in some annoyance. With Poirot away, I\r\nwas uncertain how to act. Had he foreseen this arrest? Had he not, in\r\nall probability, been the cause of it? Those questions I could not\r\nresolve. But in the meantime what was I to do? Should I announce the\r\narrest openly at Styles, or not? Though I did not acknowledge it to\r\nmyself, the thought of Mary Cavendish was weighing on me. Would it not\r\nbe a terrible shock to her? For the moment, I set aside utterly any\r\nsuspicions of her. She could not be implicated\u2014otherwise I should have\r\nheard some hint of it.\r\n\r\nOf course, there was no possibility of being able permanently to\r\nconceal Dr. Bauerstein\u2019s arrest from her. It would be announced in\r\nevery newspaper on the morrow. Still, I shrank from blurting it out. If\r\nonly Poirot had been accessible, I could have asked his advice. What\r\npossessed him to go posting off to London in this unaccountable way?\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, my opinion of his sagacity was immeasurably\r\nheightened. I would never have dreamt of suspecting the doctor, had not\r\nPoirot put it into my head. Yes, decidedly, the little man was clever.\r\n\r\nAfter some reflecting, I decided to take John into my confidence, and\r\nleave him to make the matter public or not, as he thought fit.\r\n\r\nHe gave vent to a prodigious whistle, as I imparted the news.\r\n\r\n\u201cGreat Scott! You _were_ right, then. I couldn\u2019t believe it at the\r\ntime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it is astonishing until you get used to the idea, and see how it\r\nmakes everything fit in. Now, what are we to do? Of course, it will be\r\ngenerally known to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn reflected.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d he said at last, \u201cwe won\u2019t say anything at present. There\r\nis no need. As you say, it will be known soon enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut to my intense surprise, on getting down early the next morning, and\r\neagerly opening the newspapers, there was not a word about the arrest!\r\nThere was a column of mere padding about \u201cThe Styles Poisoning Case,\u201d\r\nbut nothing further. It was rather inexplicable, but I supposed that,\r\nfor some reason or other, Japp wished to keep it out of the papers. It\r\nworried me just a little, for it suggested the possibility that there\r\nmight be further arrests to come.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, I decided to go down to the village, and see if Poirot\r\nhad returned yet; but, before I could start, a well-known face blocked\r\none of the windows, and the well-known voice said:\r\n\r\n\u201c_Bonjour, mon ami!_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot,\u201d I exclaimed, with relief, and seizing him by both hands, I\r\ndragged him into the room. \u201cI was never so glad to see anyone. Listen,\r\nI have said nothing to anybody but John. Is that right?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy friend,\u201d replied Poirot, \u201cI do not know what you are talking\r\nabout.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Bauerstein\u2019s arrest, of course,\u201d I answered impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs Bauerstein arrested, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you not know it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot the least in the world.\u201d But, pausing a moment, he added: \u201cStill,\r\nit does not surprise me. After all, we are only four miles from the\r\ncoast.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe coast?\u201d I asked, puzzled. \u201cWhat has that got to do with it?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely, it is obvious!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot to me. No doubt I am very dense, but I cannot see what the\r\nproximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of Mrs.\r\nInglethorp.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing at all, of course,\u201d replied Poirot, smiling. \u201cBut we were\r\nspeaking of the arrest of Dr. Bauerstein.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, he is arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d cried Poirot, in apparently lively astonishment. \u201cDr.\r\nBauerstein arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cImpossible! That would be too good a farce! Who told you that, my\r\nfriend?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, no one exactly told me,\u201d I confessed. \u201cBut he is arrested.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, very likely. But for espionage, _mon ami_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEspionage?\u201d I gasped.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot for poisoning Mrs. Inglethorp?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot unless our friend Japp has taken leave of his senses,\u201d replied\r\nPoirot placidly.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut\u2014but I thought you thought so too?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot gave me one look, which conveyed a wondering pity, and his full\r\nsense of the utter absurdity of such an idea.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean to say,\u201d I asked, slowly adapting myself to the new idea,\r\n\u201cthat Dr. Bauerstein is a spy?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you never suspected it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt never entered my head.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt did not strike you as peculiar that a famous London doctor should\r\nbury himself in a little village like this, and should be in the habit\r\nof walking about at all hours of the night, fully dressed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I confessed, \u201cI never thought of such a thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is, of course, a German by birth,\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully,\r\n\u201cthough he has practised so long in this country that nobody thinks of\r\nhim as anything but an Englishman. He was naturalized about fifteen\r\nyears ago. A very clever man\u2014a Jew, of course.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe blackguard!\u201d I cried indignantly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. He is, on the contrary, a patriot. Think what he stands to\r\nlose. I admire the man myself.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut I could not look at it in Poirot\u2019s philosophical way.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd this is the man with whom Mrs. Cavendish has been wandering about\r\nall over the country!\u201d I cried indignantly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I should fancy he had found her very useful,\u201d remarked Poirot.\r\n\u201cSo long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together, any\r\nother vagaries of the doctor\u2019s passed unobserved.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you think he never really cared for her?\u201d I asked eagerly\u2014rather\r\ntoo eagerly, perhaps, under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat, of course, I cannot say, but\u2014shall I tell you my own private\r\nopinion, Hastings?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is this: that Mrs. Cavendish does not care, and never has\r\ncared one little jot about Dr. Bauerstein!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d I could not disguise my pleasure.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am quite sure of it. And I will tell you why.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause she cares for someone else, _mon ami_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d What did he mean? In spite of myself, an agreeable warmth spread\r\nover me. I am not a vain man where women are concerned, but I\r\nremembered certain evidences, too lightly thought of at the time,\r\nperhaps, but which certainly seemed to indicate\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\nMy pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of Miss\r\nHoward. She glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in\r\nthe room, and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper. This she\r\nhanded to Poirot, murmuring as she did so the cryptic words:\r\n\r\n\u201cOn top of the wardrobe.\u201d Then she hurriedly left the room.\r\n\r\nPoirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly, and uttered an exclamation\r\nof satisfaction. He spread it out on the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome here, Hastings. Now tell me, what is that initial\u2014J. or L.?\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a medium sized sheet of paper, rather dusty, as though it had\r\nlain by for some time. But it was the label that was attracting\r\nPoirot\u2019s attention. At the top, it bore the printed stamp of Messrs.\r\nParkson\u2019s, the well-known theatrical costumiers, and it was addressed\r\nto \u201c\u2014(the debatable initial) Cavendish, Esq., Styles Court, Styles St.\r\nMary, Essex.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt might be T., or it might be L.,\u201d I said, after studying the thing\r\nfor a minute or two. \u201cIt certainly isn\u2019t a J.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d replied Poirot, folding up the paper again. \u201cI, also, am of\r\nyour way of thinking. It is an L., depend upon it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere did it come from?\u201d I asked curiously. \u201cIs it important?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cModerately so. It confirms a surmise of mine. Having deduced its\r\nexistence, I set Miss Howard to search for it, and, as you see, she has\r\nbeen successful.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did she mean by \u2018On the top of the wardrobe\u2019?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe meant,\u201d replied Poirot promptly, \u201cthat she found it on top of a\r\nwardrobe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA funny place for a piece of brown paper,\u201d I mused.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. The top of a wardrobe is an excellent place for brown\r\npaper and cardboard boxes. I have kept them there myself. Neatly\r\narranged, there is nothing to offend the eye.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot,\u201d I asked earnestly, \u201chave you made up your mind about this\r\ncrime?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014that is to say, I believe I know how it was committed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, I have no proof beyond my surmise, unless\u2014\u2014\u201d With\r\nsudden energy, he caught me by the arm, and whirled me down the hall,\r\ncalling out in French in his excitement: \u201cMademoiselle Dorcas,\r\nMademoiselle Dorcas, _un moment, s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet!_\u201d\r\n\r\nDorcas, quite flurried by the noise, came hurrying out of the pantry.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy good Dorcas, I have an idea\u2014a little idea\u2014if it should prove\r\njustified, what magnificent chance! Tell me, on Monday, not Tuesday,\r\nDorcas, but Monday, the day before the tragedy, did anything go wrong\r\nwith Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s bell?\u201d\r\n\r\nDorcas looked very surprised.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, now you mention it, it did; though I don\u2019t know how you came\r\nto hear of it. A mouse, or some such, must have nibbled the wire\r\nthrough. The man came and put it right on Tuesday morning.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a long drawn exclamation of ecstasy, Poirot led the way back to\r\nthe morning-room.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee you, one should not ask for outside proof\u2014no, reason should be\r\nenough. But the flesh is weak, it is consolation to find that one is on\r\nthe right track. Ah, my friend, I am like a giant refreshed. I run! I\r\nleap!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd, in very truth, run and leap he did, gambolling wildly down the\r\nstretch of lawn outside the long window.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is your remarkable little friend doing?\u201d asked a voice behind me,\r\nand I turned to find Mary Cavendish at my elbow. She smiled, and so did\r\nI. \u201cWhat is it all about?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally, I can\u2019t tell you. He asked Dorcas some question about a bell,\r\nand appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering about as\r\nyou see!\u201d\r\n\r\nMary laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow ridiculous! He\u2019s going out of the gate. Isn\u2019t he coming back\r\nto-day?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve given up trying to guess what he\u2019ll do next.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs he quite mad, Mr. Hastings?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know. Sometimes, I feel sure he is as mad as a\r\nhatter; and then, just as he is at his maddest, I find there is method\r\nin his madness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn spite of her laugh, Mary was looking thoughtful this morning. She\r\nseemed grave, almost sad.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity to tackle her on\r\nthe subject of Cynthia. I began rather tactfully, _I_ thought, but I\r\nhad not gone far before she stopped me authoritatively.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are an excellent advocate, I have no doubt, Mr. Hastings, but in\r\nthis case your talents are quite thrown away. Cynthia will run no risk\r\nof encountering any unkindness from me.\u201d\r\n\r\nI began to stammer feebly that I hoped she hadn\u2019t thought\u2014\u2014 But again\r\nshe stopped me, and her words were so unexpected that they quite drove\r\nCynthia, and her troubles, out of my mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Hastings,\u201d she said, \u201cdo you think I and my husband are happy\r\ntogether?\u201d\r\n\r\nI was considerably taken aback, and murmured something about it\u2019s not\r\nbeing my business to think anything of the sort.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cwhether it is your business or not, I will\r\ntell you that we are _not_ happy.\u201d\r\n\r\nI said nothing, for I saw that she had not finished.\r\n\r\nShe began slowly, walking up and down the room, her head a little bent,\r\nand that slim, supple figure of hers swaying gently as she walked. She\r\nstopped suddenly, and looked up at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about me, do you?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhere I come\r\nfrom, who I was before I married John\u2014anything, in fact? Well, I will\r\ntell you. I will make a father confessor of you. You are kind, I\r\nthink\u2014yes, I am sure you are kind.\u201d\r\n\r\nSomehow, I was not quite as elated as I might have been. I remembered\r\nthat Cynthia had begun her confidences in much the same way. Besides, a\r\nfather confessor should be elderly, it is not at all the role for a\r\nyoung man.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy father was English,\u201d said Mrs. Cavendish, \u201cbut my mother was a\r\nRussian.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said, \u201cnow I understand\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUnderstand what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA hint of something foreign\u2014different\u2014that there has always been about\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy mother was very beautiful, I believe. I don\u2019t know, because I never\r\nsaw her. She died when I was quite a little child. I believe there was\r\nsome tragedy connected with her death\u2014she took an overdose of some\r\nsleeping draught by mistake. However that may be, my father was\r\nbroken-hearted. Shortly afterwards, he went into the Consular Service.\r\nEverywhere he went, I went with him. When I was twenty-three, I had\r\nbeen nearly all over the world. It was a splendid life\u2014I loved it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a smile on her face, and her head was thrown back. She seemed\r\nliving in the memory of those old glad days.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen my father died. He left me very badly off. I had to go and live\r\nwith some old aunts in Yorkshire.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cYou will understand\r\nme when I say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as I had\r\nbeen. The narrowness, the deadly monotony of it, almost drove me mad.\u201d\r\nShe paused a minute, and added in a different tone: \u201cAnd then I met\r\nJohn Cavendish.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can imagine that, from my aunts\u2019 point of view, it was a very good\r\nmatch for me. But I can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed\r\nwith me. No, he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable\r\nmonotony of my life.\u201d\r\n\r\nI said nothing, and after a moment, she went on:\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand me. I was quite honest with him. I told him, what\r\nwas true, that I liked him very much, that I hoped to come to like him\r\nmore, but that I was not in any way what the world calls \u2018in love\u2019 with\r\nhim. He declared that that satisfied him, and so\u2014we were married.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe waited a long time, a little frown had gathered on her forehead.\r\nShe seemed to be looking back earnestly into those past days.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think\u2014I am sure\u2014he cared for me at first. But I suppose we were not\r\nwell matched. Almost at once, we drifted apart. He\u2014it is not a pleasing\r\nthing for my pride, but it is the truth\u2014tired of me very soon.\u201d I must\r\nhave made some murmur of dissent, for she went on quickly: \u201cOh, yes, he\r\ndid! Not that it matters now\u2014now that we\u2019ve come to the parting of the\r\nways.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe answered quietly:\r\n\r\n\u201cI mean that I am not going to remain at Styles.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou and John are not going to live here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJohn may live here, but I shall not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are going to leave him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe paused a long time, and said at last:\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps\u2014because I want to be\u2014free!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd, as she spoke, I had a sudden vision of broad spaces, virgin tracts\r\nof forests, untrodden lands\u2014and a realization of what freedom would\r\nmean to such a nature as Mary Cavendish. I seemed to see her for a\r\nmoment as she was, a proud wild creature, as untamed by civilization as\r\nsome shy bird of the hills. A little cry broke from her lips:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know, you don\u2019t know, how this hateful place has been prison\r\nto me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI understand,\u201d I said, \u201cbut\u2014but don\u2019t do anything rash.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, rash!\u201d Her voice mocked at my prudence.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly I said a thing I could have bitten out my tongue for:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know that Dr. Bauerstein has been arrested?\u201d\r\n\r\nAn instant coldness passed like a mask over her face, blotting out all\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\u201cJohn was so kind as to break that to me this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what do you think?\u201d I asked feebly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf the arrest?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat should I think? Apparently he is a German spy; so the gardener\r\nhad told John.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer face and voice were absolutely cold and expressionless. Did she\r\ncare, or did she not?\r\n\r\nShe moved away a step or two, and fingered one of the flower vases.\r\n\r\n\u201cThese are quite dead. I must do them again. Would you mind\r\nmoving\u2014thank you, Mr. Hastings.\u201d And she walked quietly past me out of\r\nthe window, with a cool little nod of dismissal.\r\n\r\nNo, surely she could not care for Bauerstein. No woman could act her\r\npart with that icy unconcern.\r\n\r\nPoirot did not make his appearance the following morning, and there was\r\nno sign of the Scotland Yard men.\r\n\r\nBut, at lunch-time, there arrived a new piece of evidence\u2014or rather\r\nlack of evidence. We had vainly tried to trace the fourth letter, which\r\nMrs. Inglethorp had written on the evening preceding her death. Our\r\nefforts having been in vain, we had abandoned the matter, hoping that\r\nit might turn up of itself one day. And this is just what did happen,\r\nin the shape of a communication, which arrived by the second post from\r\na firm of French music publishers, acknowledging Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s\r\ncheque, and regretting they had been unable to trace a certain series\r\nof Russian folksongs. So the last hope of solving the mystery, by means\r\nof Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s correspondence on the fatal evening, had to be\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nJust before tea, I strolled down to tell Poirot of the new\r\ndisappointment, but found, to my annoyance, that he was once more out.\r\n\r\n\u201cGone to London again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, monsieur, he has but taken the train to Tadminster. \u2018To see a\r\nyoung lady\u2019s dispensary,\u2019 he said.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSilly ass!\u201d I ejaculated. \u201cI told him Wednesday was the one day she\r\nwasn\u2019t there! Well, tell him to look us up to-morrow morning, will\r\nyou?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut, on the following day, no sign of Poirot. I was getting angry. He\r\nwas really treating us in the most cavalier fashion.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, Lawrence drew me aside, and asked if I was going down to\r\nsee him.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I shall. He can come up here if he wants to see us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Lawrence looked indeterminate. Something unusually nervous and\r\nexcited in his manner roused my curiosity.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked. \u201cI could go if there\u2019s anything special.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much, but\u2014well, if you are going, will you tell him\u2014\u2014\u201d he\r\ndropped his voice to a whisper\u2014\u201cI think I\u2019ve found the extra\r\ncoffee-cup!\u201d\r\n\r\nI had almost forgotten that enigmatical message of Poirot\u2019s, but now my\r\ncuriosity was aroused afresh.\r\n\r\nLawrence would say no more, so I decided that I would descend from my\r\nhigh horse, and once more seek out Poirot at Leastways Cottage.\r\n\r\nThis time I was received with a smile. Monsieur Poirot was within.\r\nWould I mount? I mounted accordingly.\r\n\r\nPoirot was sitting by the table, his head buried in his hands. He\r\nsprang up at my entrance.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked solicitously. \u201cYou are not ill, I trust?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, not ill. But I decide an affair of great moment.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhether to catch the criminal or not?\u201d I asked facetiously.\r\n\r\nBut, to my great surprise, Poirot nodded gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018To speak or not to speak,\u2019 as your so great Shakespeare says, \u2018that\r\nis the question.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not trouble to correct the quotation.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are not serious, Poirot?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am of the most serious. For the most serious of all things hangs in\r\nthe balance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that is?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA woman\u2019s happiness, _mon ami_,\u201d he said gravely.\r\n\r\nI did not quite know what to say.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe moment has come,\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully, \u201cand I do not know\r\nwhat to do. For, see you, it is a big stake for which I play. No one\r\nbut I, Hercule Poirot, would attempt it!\u201d And he tapped himself proudly\r\non the breast.\r\n\r\nAfter pausing a few minutes respectfully, so as not to spoil his\r\neffect, I gave him Lawrence\u2019s message.\r\n\r\n\u201cAha!\u201d he cried. \u201cSo he has found the extra coffee-cup. That is good.\r\nHe has more intelligence than would appear, this long-faced Monsieur\r\nLawrence of yours!\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not myself think very highly of Lawrence\u2019s intelligence; but I\r\nforebore to contradict Poirot, and gently took him to task for\r\nforgetting my instructions as to which were Cynthia\u2019s days off.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is true. I have the head of a sieve. However, the other young lady\r\nwas most kind. She was sorry for my disappointment, and showed me\r\neverything in the kindest way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, well, that\u2019s all right, then, and you must go to tea with Cynthia\r\nanother day.\u201d\r\n\r\nI told him about the letter.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sorry for that,\u201d he said. \u201cI always had hopes of that letter. But\r\nno, it was not to be. This affair must all be unravelled from within.\u201d\r\nHe tapped his forehead. \u201cThese little grey cells. It is \u2018up to them\u2019\u2014as\r\nyou say over here.\u201d Then, suddenly, he asked: \u201cAre you a judge of\r\nfinger-marks, my friend?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, rather surprised, \u201cI know that there are no two\r\nfinger-marks alike, but that\u2019s as far as my science goes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe unlocked a little drawer, and took out some photographs which he\r\nlaid on the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have numbered them, 1, 2, 3. Will you describe them to me?\u201d\r\n\r\nI studied the proofs attentively.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll greatly magnified, I see. No. 1, I should say, are a man\u2019s\r\nfinger-prints; thumb and first finger. No. 2 are a lady\u2019s; they are\r\nmuch smaller, and quite different in every way. No. 3\u201d\u2014I paused for\r\nsome time\u2014\u201cthere seem to be a lot of confused finger-marks, but here,\r\nvery distinctly, are No. 1\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOverlapping the others?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou recognize them beyond fail?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes; they are identical.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded, and gently taking the photographs from me locked them up\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d I said, \u201cthat as usual, you are not going to explain?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary. No. 1 were the finger-prints of Monsieur Lawrence.\r\nNo. 2 were those of Mademoiselle Cynthia. They are not important. I\r\nmerely obtained them for comparison. No. 3 is a little more\r\ncomplicated.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is, as you see, highly magnified. You may have noticed a sort of\r\nblur extending all across the picture. I will not describe to you the\r\nspecial apparatus, dusting powder, etc., which I used. It is a\r\nwell-known process to the police, and by means of it you can obtain a\r\nphotograph of the finger-prints of any object in a very short space of\r\ntime. Well, my friend, you have seen the finger-marks\u2014it remains to\r\ntell you the particular object on which they had been left.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on\u2014I am really excited.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien!_ Photo No. 3 represents the highly magnified surface of a\r\ntiny bottle in the top poison cupboard of the dispensary in the Red\r\nCross Hospital at Tadminster\u2014which sounds like the house that Jack\r\nbuilt!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cBut what were Lawrence Cavendish\u2019s\r\nfinger-marks doing on it? He never went near the poison cupboard the\r\nday we were there!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, he did!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cImpossible! We were all together the whole time.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, my friend, there was a moment when you were not all together.\r\nThere was a moment when you could not have been all together, or it\r\nwould not have been necessary to call to Monsieur Lawrence to come and\r\njoin you on the balcony.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d forgotten that,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut it was only for a moment.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLong enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLong enough for what?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot\u2019s smile became rather enigmatical.\r\n\r\n\u201cLong enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a\r\nvery natural interest and curiosity.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur eyes met. Poirot\u2019s were pleasantly vague. He got up and hummed a\r\nlittle tune. I watched him suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot,\u201d I said, \u201cwhat was in this particular little bottle?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot looked out of the window.\r\n\r\n\u201cHydro-chloride of strychnine,\u201d he said, over his shoulder, continuing\r\nto hum.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d I said it quite quietly. I was not surprised. I had\r\nexpected that answer.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey use the pure hydro-chloride of strychnine very little\u2014only\r\noccasionally for pills. It is the official solution, Liq. Strychnine\r\nHydro-clor. that is used in most medicines. That is why the\r\nfinger-marks have remained undisturbed since then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you manage to take this photograph?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI dropped my hat from the balcony,\u201d explained Poirot simply. \u201cVisitors\r\nwere not permitted below at that hour, so, in spite of my many\r\napologies, Mademoiselle Cynthia\u2019s colleague had to go down and fetch it\r\nfor me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you knew what you were going to find?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, not at all. I merely realized that it was possible, from your\r\nstory, for Monsieur Lawrence to go to the poison cupboard. The\r\npossibility had to be confirmed, or eliminated.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot,\u201d I said, \u201cyour gaiety does not deceive me. This is a very\r\nimportant discovery.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know,\u201d said Poirot. \u201cBut one thing does strike me. No doubt\r\nit has struck you too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, that there is altogether too much strychnine about this case.\r\nThis is the third time we run up against it. There was strychnine in\r\nMrs. Inglethorp\u2019s tonic. There is the strychnine sold across the\r\ncounter at Styles St. Mary by Mace. Now we have more strychnine,\r\nhandled by one of the household. It is confusing; and, as you know, I\r\ndo not like confusion.\u201d\r\n\r\nBefore I could reply, one of the other Belgians opened the door and\r\nstuck his head in.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is a lady below, asking for Mr Hastings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA lady?\u201d\r\n\r\nI jumped up. Poirot followed me down the narrow stairs. Mary Cavendish\r\nwas standing in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been visiting an old woman in the village,\u201d she explained, \u201cand\r\nas Lawrence told me you were with Monsieur Poirot I thought I would\r\ncall for you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlas, madame,\u201d said Poirot, \u201cI thought you had come to honour me with\r\na visit!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will some day, if you ask me,\u201d she promised him, smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is well. If you should need a father confessor, madame\u201d\u2014she\r\nstarted ever so slightly\u2014\u201cremember, Papa Poirot is always at your\r\nservice.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stared at him for a few minutes, as though seeking to read some\r\ndeeper meaning into his words. Then she turned abruptly away.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, will you not walk back with us too, Monsieur Poirot?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEnchanted, madame.\u201d\r\n\r\nAll the way to Styles, Mary talked fast and feverishly. It struck me\r\nthat in some way she was nervous of Poirot\u2019s eyes.\r\n\r\nThe weather had broken, and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its\r\nshrewishness. Mary shivered a little, and buttoned her black sports\r\ncoat closer. The wind through the trees made a mournful noise, like\r\nsome great giant sighing.\r\n\r\nWe walked up to the great door of Styles, and at once the knowledge\r\ncame to us that something was wrong.\r\n\r\nDorcas came running out to meet us. She was crying and wringing her\r\nhands. I was aware of other servants huddled together in the\r\nbackground, all eyes and ears.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, m\u2019am! Oh, m\u2019am! I don\u2019t know how to tell you\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it, Dorcas?\u201d I asked impatiently. \u201cTell us at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s those wicked detectives. They\u2019ve arrested him\u2014they\u2019ve arrested\r\nMr. Cavendish!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cArrested Lawrence?\u201d I gasped.\r\n\r\nI saw a strange look come into Dorcas\u2019s eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir. Not Mr. Lawrence\u2014Mr. John.\u201d\r\n\r\nBehind me, with a wild cry, Mary Cavendish fell heavily against me, and\r\nas I turned to catch her I met the quiet triumph in Poirot\u2019s eyes.\r\n\nThe trial of John Cavendish for the murder of his stepmother took place\r\ntwo months later.\r\n\r\nOf the intervening weeks I will say little, but my admiration and\r\nsympathy went out unfeignedly to Mary Cavendish. She ranged herself\r\npassionately on her husband\u2019s side, scorning the mere idea of his\r\nguilt, and fought for him tooth and nail.\r\n\r\nI expressed my admiration to Poirot, and he nodded thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, she is of those women who show at their best in adversity. It\r\nbrings out all that is sweetest and truest in them. Her pride and her\r\njealousy have\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJealousy?\u201d I queried.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Have you not realized that she is an unusually jealous woman? As\r\nI was saying, her pride and jealousy have been laid aside. She thinks\r\nof nothing but her husband, and the terrible fate that is hanging over\r\nhim.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe spoke very feelingly, and I looked at him earnestly, remembering\r\nthat last afternoon, when he had been deliberating whether or not to\r\nspeak. With his tenderness for \u201ca woman\u2019s happiness,\u201d I felt glad that\r\nthe decision had been taken out of his hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cEven now,\u201d I said, \u201cI can hardly believe it. You see, up to the very\r\nlast minute, I thought it was Lawrence!\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot grinned.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know you did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut John! My old friend John!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery murderer is probably somebody\u2019s old friend,\u201d observed Poirot\r\nphilosophically. \u201cYou cannot mix up sentiment and reason.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI must say I think you might have given me a hint.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps, _mon ami_, I did not do so, just because he _was_ your old\r\nfriend.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was rather disconcerted by this, remembering how I had busily passed\r\non to John what I believed to be Poirot\u2019s views concerning Bauerstein.\r\nHe, by the way, had been acquitted of the charge brought against him.\r\nNevertheless, although he had been too clever for them this time, and\r\nthe charge of espionage could not be brought home to him, his wings\r\nwere pretty well clipped for the future.\r\n\r\nI asked Poirot whether he thought John would be condemned. To my\r\nintense surprise, he replied that, on the contrary, he was extremely\r\nlikely to be acquitted.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, Poirot\u2014\u2014\u201d I protested.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, my friend, have I not said to you all along that I have no proofs.\r\nIt is one thing to know that a man is guilty, it is quite another\r\nmatter to prove him so. And, in this case, there is terribly little\r\nevidence. That is the whole trouble. I, Hercule Poirot, know, but I\r\nlack the last link in my chain. And unless I can find that missing\r\nlink\u2014\u2014\u201d He shook his head gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did you first suspect John Cavendish?\u201d I asked, after a minute or\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you not suspect him at all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot after that fragment of conversation you overheard between Mrs.\r\nCavendish and her mother-in-law, and her subsequent lack of frankness\r\nat the inquest?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you not put two and two together, and reflect that if it was not\r\nAlfred Inglethorp who was quarrelling with his wife\u2014and you remember,\r\nhe strenuously denied it at the inquest\u2014it must be either Lawrence or\r\nJohn. Now, if it was Lawrence, Mary Cavendish\u2019s conduct was just as\r\ninexplicable. But if, on the other hand, it was John, the whole thing\r\nwas explained quite naturally.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d I cried, a light breaking in upon me, \u201cit was John who quarrelled\r\nwith his mother that afternoon?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you have known this all along?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. Mrs. Cavendish\u2019s behaviour could only be explained that\r\nway.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet you say he may be acquitted?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly I do. At the police court proceedings, we shall hear the\r\ncase for the prosecution, but in all probability his solicitors will\r\nadvise him to reserve his defence. That will be sprung upon us at the\r\ntrial. And\u2014ah, by the way, I have a word of caution to give you, my\r\nfriend. I must not appear in the case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. Officially, I have nothing to do with it. Until I have found that\r\nlast link in my chain, I must remain behind the scenes. Mrs. Cavendish\r\nmust think I am working for her husband, not against him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI say, that\u2019s playing it a bit low down,\u201d I protested.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. We have to deal with a most clever and unscrupulous man,\r\nand we must use any means in our power\u2014otherwise he will slip through\r\nour fingers. That is why I have been careful to remain in the\r\nbackground. All the discoveries have been made by Japp, and Japp will\r\ntake all the credit. If I am called upon to give evidence at all\u201d\u2014he\r\nsmiled broadly\u2014\u201cit will probably be as a witness for the defence.\u201d\r\n\r\nI could hardly believe my ears.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is quite _en r\u00e8gle_,\u201d continued Poirot. \u201cStrangely enough, I can\r\ngive evidence that will demolish one contention of the prosecution.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich one?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe one that relates to the destruction of the will. John Cavendish\r\ndid not destroy that will.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot was a true prophet. I will not go into the details of the police\r\ncourt proceedings, as it involves many tiresome repetitions. I will\r\nmerely state baldly that John Cavendish reserved his defence, and was\r\nduly committed for trial.\r\n\r\nSeptember found us all in London. Mary took a house in Kensington,\r\nPoirot being included in the family party.\r\n\r\nI myself had been given a job at the War Office, so was able to see\r\nthem continually.\r\n\r\nAs the weeks went by, the state of Poirot\u2019s nerves grew worse and\r\nworse. That \u201clast link\u201d he talked about was still lacking. Privately, I\r\nhoped it might remain so, for what happiness could there be for Mary,\r\nif John were not acquitted?\r\n\r\nOn September 15th John Cavendish appeared in the dock at the Old\r\nBailey, charged with \u201cThe Wilful Murder of Emily Agnes Inglethorp,\u201d and\r\npleaded \u201cNot Guilty.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir Ernest Heavywether, the famous K.C., had been engaged to defend\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMr. Philips, K.C., opened the case for the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe murder, he said, was a most premeditated and cold-blooded one. It\r\nwas neither more nor less than the deliberate poisoning of a fond and\r\ntrusting woman by the stepson to whom she had been more than a mother.\r\nEver since his boyhood, she had supported him. He and his wife had\r\nlived at Styles Court in every luxury, surrounded by her care and\r\nattention. She had been their kind and generous benefactress.\r\n\r\nHe proposed to call witnesses to show how the prisoner, a profligate\r\nand spendthrift, had been at the end of his financial tether, and had\r\nalso been carrying on an intrigue with a certain Mrs. Raikes, a\r\nneighbouring farmer\u2019s wife. This having come to his stepmother\u2019s ears,\r\nshe taxed him with it on the afternoon before her death, and a quarrel\r\nensued, part of which was overheard. On the previous day, the prisoner\r\nhad purchased strychnine at the village chemist\u2019s shop, wearing a\r\ndisguise by means of which he hoped to throw the onus of the crime upon\r\nanother man\u2014to wit, Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s husband, of whom he had been\r\nbitterly jealous. Luckily for Mr. Inglethorp, he had been able to\r\nproduce an unimpeachable alibi.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of July 17th, continued Counsel, immediately after the\r\nquarrel with her son, Mrs. Inglethorp made a new will. This will was\r\nfound destroyed in the grate of her bedroom the following morning, but\r\nevidence had come to light which showed that it had been drawn up in\r\nfavour of her husband. Deceased had already made a will in his favour\r\nbefore her marriage, but\u2014and Mr. Philips wagged an expressive\r\nforefinger\u2014the prisoner was not aware of that. What had induced the\r\ndeceased to make a fresh will, with the old one still extant, he could\r\nnot say. She was an old lady, and might possibly have forgotten the\r\nformer one; or\u2014this seemed to him more likely\u2014she may have had an idea\r\nthat it was revoked by her marriage, as there had been some\r\nconversation on the subject. Ladies were not always very well versed in\r\nlegal knowledge. She had, about a year before, executed a will in\r\nfavour of the prisoner. He would call evidence to show that it was the\r\nprisoner who ultimately handed his stepmother her coffee on the fatal\r\nnight. Later in the evening, he had sought admission to her room, on\r\nwhich occasion, no doubt, he found an opportunity of destroying the\r\nwill which, as far as he knew, would render the one in his favour\r\nvalid.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner had been arrested in consequence of the discovery, in his\r\nroom, by Detective Inspector Japp\u2014a most brilliant officer\u2014of the\r\nidentical phial of strychnine which had been sold at the village\r\nchemist\u2019s to the supposed Mr. Inglethorp on the day before the murder.\r\nIt would be for the jury to decide whether or not these damning facts\r\nconstituted an overwhelming proof of the prisoner\u2019s guilt.\r\n\r\nAnd, subtly implying that a jury which did not so decide, was quite\r\nunthinkable, Mr. Philips sat down and wiped his forehead.\r\n\r\nThe first witnesses for the prosecution were mostly those who had been\r\ncalled at the inquest, the medical evidence being again taken first.\r\n\r\nSir Ernest Heavywether, who was famous all over England for the\r\nunscrupulous manner in which he bullied witnesses, only asked two\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\u201cI take it, Dr. Bauerstein, that strychnine, as a drug, acts quickly?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that you are unable to account for the delay in this case?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Mace identified the phial handed him by Counsel as that sold by him\r\nto \u201cMr. Inglethorp.\u201d Pressed, he admitted that he only knew Mr.\r\nInglethorp by sight. He had never spoken to him. The witness was not\r\ncross-examined.\r\n\r\nAlfred Inglethorp was called, and denied having purchased the poison.\r\nHe also denied having quarrelled with his wife. Various witnesses\r\ntestified to the accuracy of these statements.\r\n\r\nThe gardeners\u2019 evidence, as to the witnessing of the will was taken,\r\nand then Dorcas was called.\r\n\r\nDorcas, faithful to her \u201cyoung gentlemen,\u201d denied strenuously that it\r\ncould have been John\u2019s voice she heard, and resolutely declared, in the\r\nteeth of everything, that it was Mr. Inglethorp who had been in the\r\nboudoir with her mistress. A rather wistful smile passed across the\r\nface of the prisoner in the dock. He knew only too well how useless her\r\ngallant defiance was, since it was not the object of the defence to\r\ndeny this point. Mrs. Cavendish, of course, could not be called upon to\r\ngive evidence against her husband.\r\n\r\nAfter various questions on other matters, Mr. Philips asked:\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the month of June last, do you remember a parcel arriving for Mr.\r\nLawrence Cavendish from Parkson\u2019s?\u201d\r\n\r\nDorcas shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember, sir. It may have done, but Mr. Lawrence was away\r\nfrom home part of June.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the event of a parcel arriving for him whilst he was away, what\r\nwould be done with it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would either be put in his room or sent on after him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, I should leave it on the hall table. It would be Miss Howard\r\nwho would attend to anything like that.\u201d\r\n\r\nEvelyn Howard was called and, after being examined on other points, was\r\nquestioned as to the parcel.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t remember. Lots of parcels come. Can\u2019t remember one special one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do not know if it was sent after Mr. Lawrence Cavendish to Wales,\r\nor whether it was put in his room?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t think it was sent after him. Should have remembered it if it\r\nwas.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSupposing a parcel arrived addressed to Mr. Lawrence Cavendish, and\r\nafterwards it disappeared, should you remark its absence?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t think so. I should think someone had taken charge of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe, Miss Howard, that it was you who found this sheet of brown\r\npaper?\u201d He held up the same dusty piece which Poirot and I had examined\r\nin the morning-room at Styles.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you come to look for it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Belgian detective who was employed on the case asked me to search\r\nfor it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere did you eventually discover it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the top of\u2014of\u2014a wardrobe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn top of the prisoner\u2019s wardrobe?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2014I believe so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you not find it yourself?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you must know where you found it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it was on the prisoner\u2019s wardrobe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is better.\u201d\r\n\r\nAn assistant from Parkson\u2019s, Theatrical Costumiers, testified that on\r\nJune 29th, they had supplied a black beard to Mr. L. Cavendish, as\r\nrequested. It was ordered by letter, and a postal order was enclosed.\r\nNo, they had not kept the letter. All transactions were entered in\r\ntheir books. They had sent the beard, as directed, to \u201cL. Cavendish,\r\nEsq., Styles Court.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir Ernest Heavywether rose ponderously.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere was the letter written from?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom Styles Court.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe same address to which you sent the parcel?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the letter came from there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\nLike a beast of prey, Heavywether fell upon him:\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you know that letter came from Styles? Did you notice the\r\npostmark?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014but\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, you did _not_ notice the postmark! And yet you affirm so\r\nconfidently that it came from Styles. It might, in fact, have been any\r\npostmark?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cY\u2014es.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn fact, the letter, though written on stamped notepaper, might have\r\nbeen posted from anywhere? From Wales, for instance?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe witness admitted that such might be the case, and Sir Ernest\r\nsignified that he was satisfied.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Wells, second housemaid at Styles, stated that after she had\r\ngone to bed she remembered that she had bolted the front door, instead\r\nof leaving it on the latch as Mr. Inglethorp had requested. She had\r\naccordingly gone downstairs again to rectify her error. Hearing a\r\nslight noise in the West wing, she had peeped along the passage, and\r\nhad seen Mr. John Cavendish knocking at Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s door.\r\n\r\nSir Ernest Heavywether made short work of her, and under his unmerciful\r\nbullying she contradicted herself hopelessly, and Sir Ernest sat down\r\nagain with a satisfied smile on his face.\r\n\r\nWith the evidence of Annie, as to the candle grease on the floor, and\r\nas to seeing the prisoner take the coffee into the boudoir, the\r\nproceedings were adjourned until the following day.\r\n\r\nAs we went home, Mary Cavendish spoke bitterly against the prosecuting\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat hateful man! What a net he has drawn around my poor John! How he\r\ntwisted every little fact until he made it seem what it wasn\u2019t!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said consolingly, \u201cit will be the other way about to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said meditatively; then suddenly dropped her voice. \u201cMr.\r\nHastings, you do not think\u2014surely it could not have been Lawrence\u2014Oh,\r\nno, that could not be!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut I myself was puzzled, and as soon as I was alone with Poirot I\r\nasked him what he thought Sir Ernest was driving at.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Poirot appreciatively. \u201cHe is a clever man, that Sir\r\nErnest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you think he believes Lawrence guilty?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not think he believes or cares anything! No, what he is trying\r\nfor is to create such confusion in the minds of the jury that they are\r\ndivided in their opinion as to which brother did it. He is endeavouring\r\nto make out that there is quite as much evidence against Lawrence as\r\nagainst John\u2014and I am not at all sure that he will not succeed.\u201d\r\n\r\nDetective-inspector Japp was the first witness called when the trial\r\nwas reopened, and gave his evidence succinctly and briefly. After\r\nrelating the earlier events, he proceeded:\r\n\r\n\u201cActing on information received, Superintendent Summerhaye and myself\r\nsearched the prisoner\u2019s room, during his temporary absence from the\r\nhouse. In his chest of drawers, hidden beneath some underclothing, we\r\nfound: first, a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez similar to those worn by\r\nMr. Inglethorp\u201d\u2014these were exhibited\u2014\u201csecondly, this phial.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe phial was that already recognized by the chemist\u2019s assistant, a\r\ntiny bottle of blue glass, containing a few grains of a white\r\ncrystalline powder, and labelled: \u201cStrychnine Hydro-chloride. POISON.\u201d\r\n\r\nA fresh piece of evidence discovered by the detectives since the police\r\ncourt proceedings was a long, almost new piece of blotting-paper. It\r\nhad been found in Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s cheque book, and on being reversed\r\nat a mirror, showed clearly the words: \u201c. . . erything of which I die\r\npossessed I leave to my beloved husband Alfred Ing...\u201d This placed\r\nbeyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour of\r\nthe deceased lady\u2019s husband. Japp then produced the charred fragment of\r\npaper recovered from the grate, and this, with the discovery of the\r\nbeard in the attic, completed his evidence.\r\n\r\nBut Sir Ernest\u2019s cross-examination was yet to come.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat day was it when you searched the prisoner\u2019s room?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTuesday, the 24th of July.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly a week after the tragedy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou found these two objects, you say, in the chest of drawers. Was the\r\ndrawer unlocked?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes it not strike you as unlikely that a man who had committed a\r\ncrime should keep the evidence of it in an unlocked drawer for anyone\r\nto find?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe might have stowed them there in a hurry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you have just said it was a whole week since the crime. He would\r\nhave had ample time to remove them and destroy them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no perhaps about it. Would he, or would he not have had\r\nplenty of time to remove and destroy them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas the pile of underclothes under which the things were hidden heavy\r\nor light?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHeavyish.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn other words, it was winter underclothing. Obviously, the prisoner\r\nwould not be likely to go to that drawer?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKindly answer my question. Would the prisoner, in the hottest week of\r\na hot summer, be likely to go to a drawer containing winter\r\nunderclothing. Yes, or no?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn that case, is it not possible that the articles in question might\r\nhave been put there by a third person, and that the prisoner was quite\r\nunaware of their presence?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should not think it likely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it is possible?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is all.\u201d\r\n\r\nMore evidence followed. Evidence as to the financial difficulties in\r\nwhich the prisoner had found himself at the end of July. Evidence as to\r\nhis intrigue with Mrs. Raikes\u2014poor Mary, that must have been bitter\r\nhearing for a woman of her pride. Evelyn Howard had been right in her\r\nfacts, though her animosity against Alfred Inglethorp had caused her to\r\njump to the conclusion that he was the person concerned.\r\n\r\nLawrence Cavendish was then put into the box. In a low voice, in answer\r\nto Mr. Philips\u2019 questions, he denied having ordered anything from\r\nParkson\u2019s in June. In fact, on June 29th, he had been staying away, in\r\nWales.\r\n\r\nInstantly, Sir Ernest\u2019s chin was shooting pugnaciously forward.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou deny having ordered a black beard from Parkson\u2019s on June 29th?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! In the event of anything happening to your brother, who will\r\ninherit Styles Court?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe brutality of the question called a flush to Lawrence\u2019s pale face.\r\nThe judge gave vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation, and the\r\nprisoner in the dock leant forward angrily.\r\n\r\nHeavywether cared nothing for his client\u2019s anger.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnswer my question, if you please.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d said Lawrence quietly, \u201cthat I should.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by you \u2018suppose\u2019? Your brother has no children. You\r\n_would_ inherit it, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s better,\u201d said Heavywether, with ferocious geniality. \u201cAnd\r\nyou\u2019d inherit a good slice of money too, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally, Sir Ernest,\u201d protested the judge, \u201cthese questions are not\r\nrelevant.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir Ernest bowed, and having shot his arrow proceeded.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn Tuesday, the 17th July, you went, I believe, with another guest, to\r\nvisit the dispensary at the Red Cross Hospital in Tadminster?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you\u2014while you happened to be alone for a few seconds\u2014unlock the\r\npoison cupboard, and examine some of the bottles?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2014may have done so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI put it to you that you did do so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir Ernest fairly shot the next question at him.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you examine one bottle in particular?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I do not think so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBe careful, Mr. Cavendish. I am referring to a little bottle of\r\nHydro-chloride of Strychnine.\u201d\r\n\r\nLawrence was turning a sickly greenish colour.\r\n\r\n\u201cN\u2014o\u2014I am sure I didn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen how do you account for the fact that you left the unmistakable\r\nimpress of your finger-prints on it?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe bullying manner was highly efficacious with a nervous disposition.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2014I suppose I must have taken up the bottle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose so too! Did you abstract any of the contents of the bottle?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen why did you take it up?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI once studied to be a doctor. Such things naturally interest me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! So poisons \u2018naturally interest\u2019 you, do they? Still, you waited to\r\nbe alone before gratifying that \u2018interest\u2019 of yours?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was pure chance. If the others had been there, I should have done\r\njust the same.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStill, as it happens, the others were not there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn fact, during the whole afternoon, you were only alone for a couple\r\nof minutes, and it happened\u2014I say, it happened\u2014to be during those two\r\nminutes that you displayed your \u2018natural interest\u2019 in Hydro-chloride of\r\nStrychnine?\u201d\r\n\r\nLawrence stammered pitiably.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a satisfied and expressive countenance, Sir Ernest observed:\r\n\r\n\u201cI have nothing more to ask you, Mr. Cavendish.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis bit of cross-examination had caused great excitement in court. The\r\nheads of the many fashionably attired women present were busily laid\r\ntogether, and their whispers became so loud that the judge angrily\r\nthreatened to have the court cleared if there was not immediate\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nThere was little more evidence. The hand-writing experts were called\r\nupon for their opinion of the signature of \u201cAlfred Inglethorp\u201d in the\r\nchemist\u2019s poison register. They all declared unanimously that it was\r\ncertainly not his hand-writing, and gave it as their view that it might\r\nbe that of the prisoner disguised. Cross-examined, they admitted that\r\nit might be the prisoner\u2019s hand-writing cleverly counterfeited.\r\n\r\nSir Ernest Heavywether\u2019s speech in opening the case for the defence was\r\nnot a long one, but it was backed by the full force of his emphatic\r\nmanner. Never, he said, in the course of his long experience, had he\r\nknown a charge of murder rest on slighter evidence. Not only was it\r\nentirely circumstantial, but the greater part of it was practically\r\nunproved. Let them take the testimony they had heard and sift it\r\nimpartially. The strychnine had been found in a drawer in the\r\nprisoner\u2019s room. That drawer was an unlocked one, as he had pointed\r\nout, and he submitted that there was no evidence to prove that it was\r\nthe prisoner who had concealed the poison there. It was, in fact, a\r\nwicked and malicious attempt on the part of some third person to fix\r\nthe crime on the prisoner. The prosecution had been unable to produce a\r\nshred of evidence in support of their contention that it was the\r\nprisoner who ordered the black beard from Parkson\u2019s. The quarrel which\r\nhad taken place between prisoner and his stepmother was freely\r\nadmitted, but both it and his financial embarrassments had been grossly\r\nexaggerated.\r\n\r\nHis learned friend\u2014Sir Ernest nodded carelessly at Mr. Philips\u2014had\r\nstated that if the prisoner were an innocent man, he would have come\r\nforward at the inquest to explain that it was he, and not Mr.\r\nInglethorp, who had been the participator in the quarrel. He thought\r\nthe facts had been misrepresented. What had actually occurred was this.\r\nThe prisoner, returning to the house on Tuesday evening, had been\r\nauthoritatively told that there had been a violent quarrel between Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Inglethorp. No suspicion had entered the prisoner\u2019s head that\r\nanyone could possibly have mistaken his voice for that of Mr.\r\nInglethorp. He naturally concluded that his stepmother had had two\r\nquarrels.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution averred that on Monday, July 16th, the prisoner had\r\nentered the chemist\u2019s shop in the village, disguised as Mr. Inglethorp.\r\nThe prisoner, on the contrary, was at that time at a lonely spot called\r\nMarston\u2019s Spinney, where he had been summoned by an anonymous note,\r\ncouched in blackmailing terms, and threatening to reveal certain\r\nmatters to his wife unless he complied with its demands. The prisoner\r\nhad, accordingly, gone to the appointed spot, and after waiting there\r\nvainly for half an hour had returned home. Unfortunately, he had met\r\nwith no one on the way there or back who could vouch for the truth of\r\nhis story, but luckily he had kept the note, and it would be produced\r\nas evidence.\r\n\r\nAs for the statement relating to the destruction of the will, the\r\nprisoner had formerly practised at the Bar, and was perfectly well\r\naware that the will made in his favour a year before was automatically\r\nrevoked by his stepmother\u2019s remarriage. He would call evidence to show\r\nwho did destroy the will, and it was possible that that might open up\r\nquite a new view of the case.\r\n\r\nFinally, he would point out to the jury that there was evidence against\r\nother people besides John Cavendish. He would direct their attention to\r\nthe fact that the evidence against Mr. Lawrence Cavendish was quite as\r\nstrong, if not stronger than that against his brother.\r\n\r\nHe would now call the prisoner.\r\n\r\nJohn acquitted himself well in the witness-box. Under Sir Ernest\u2019s\r\nskilful handling, he told his tale credibly and well. The anonymous\r\nnote received by him was produced, and handed to the jury to examine.\r\nThe readiness with which he admitted his financial difficulties, and\r\nthe disagreement with his stepmother, lent value to his denials.\r\n\r\nAt the close of his examination, he paused, and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like to make one thing clear. I utterly reject and disapprove\r\nof Sir Ernest Heavywether\u2019s insinuations against my brother. My\r\nbrother, I am convinced, had no more to do with the crime than I have.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir Ernest merely smiled, and noted with a sharp eye that John\u2019s\r\nprotest had produced a very favourable impression on the jury.\r\n\r\nThen the cross-examination began.\r\n\r\n\u201cI understand you to say that it never entered your head that the\r\nwitnesses at the inquest could possibly have mistaken your voice for\r\nthat of Mr. Inglethorp. Is not that very surprising?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I was told there had been a quarrel between my\r\nmother and Mr. Inglethorp, and it never occurred to me that such was\r\nnot really the case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot when the servant Dorcas repeated certain fragments of the\r\nconversation\u2014fragments which you must have recognized?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did not recognize them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour memory must be unusually short!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but we were both angry, and, I think, said more than we meant. I\r\npaid very little attention to my mother\u2019s actual words.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Philips\u2019 incredulous sniff was a triumph of forensic skill. He\r\npassed on to the subject of the note.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have produced this note very opportunely. Tell me, is there\r\nnothing familiar about the hand-writing of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot that I know of.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you not think that it bears a marked resemblance to your own\r\nhand-writing\u2014carelessly disguised?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I do not think so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI put it to you that it is your own hand-writing!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI put it to you that, anxious to prove an alibi, you conceived the\r\nidea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment, and wrote this\r\nnote yourself in order to bear out your statement!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it not a fact that, at the time you claim to have been waiting\r\nabout at a solitary and unfrequented spot, you were really in the\r\nchemist\u2019s shop in Styles St. Mary, where you purchased strychnine in\r\nthe name of Alfred Inglethorp?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, that is a lie.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI put it to you that, wearing a suit of Mr. Inglethorp\u2019s clothes, with\r\na black beard trimmed to resemble his, you were there\u2014and signed the\r\nregister in his name!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is absolutely untrue.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I will leave the remarkable similarity of hand-writing between\r\nthe note, the register, and your own, to the consideration of the\r\njury,\u201d said Mr. Philips, and sat down with the air of a man who has\r\ndone his duty, but who was nevertheless horrified by such deliberate\r\nperjury.\r\n\r\nAfter this, as it was growing late, the case was adjourned till Monday.\r\n\r\nPoirot, I noticed, was looking profoundly discouraged. He had that\r\nlittle frown between the eyes that I knew so well.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it, Poirot?\u201d I inquired.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, _mon ami_, things are going badly, badly.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself, my heart gave a leap of relief. Evidently there was\r\na likelihood of John Cavendish being acquitted.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the house, my little friend waved aside Mary\u2019s offer of\r\ntea.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I thank you, madame. I will mount to my room.\u201d\r\n\r\nI followed him. Still frowning, he went across to the desk and took out\r\na small pack of patience cards. Then he drew up a chair to the table,\r\nand, to my utter amazement, began solemnly to build card houses!\r\n\r\nMy jaw dropped involuntarily, and he said at once:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, _mon ami_, I am not in my second childhood! I steady my nerves,\r\nthat is all. This employment requires precision of the fingers. With\r\nprecision of the fingers goes precision of the brain. And never have I\r\nneeded that more than now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the trouble?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\nWith a great thump on the table, Poirot demolished his carefully built\r\nup edifice.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is this, _mon ami!_ That I can build card houses seven stories\r\nhigh, but I cannot\u201d\u2014thump\u2014\u201cfind\u201d\u2014thump\u2014\u201c that last link of which I\r\nspoke to you.\u201d\r\n\r\nI could not quite tell what to say, so I held my peace, and he began\r\nslowly building up the cards again, speaking in jerks as he did so.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is done\u2014so! By placing\u2014one card\u2014on another\u2014with\r\nmathematical\u2014precision!\u201d\r\n\r\nI watched the card house rising under his hands, story by story. He\r\nnever hesitated or faltered. It was really almost like a conjuring\r\ntrick.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a steady hand you\u2019ve got,\u201d I remarked. \u201cI believe I\u2019ve only seen\r\nyour hand shake once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn an occasion when I was enraged, without doubt,\u201d observed Poirot,\r\nwith great placidity.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes indeed! You were in a towering rage. Do you remember? It was when\r\nyou discovered that the lock of the despatch-case in Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s\r\nbedroom had been forced. You stood by the mantelpiece, twiddling the\r\nthings on it in your usual fashion, and your hand shook like a leaf! I\r\nmust say\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nBut I stopped suddenly. For Poirot, uttering a hoarse and inarticulate\r\ncry, again annihilated his masterpiece of cards, and putting his hands\r\nover his eyes swayed backwards and forwards, apparently suffering the\r\nkeenest agony.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens, Poirot!\u201d I cried. \u201cWhat is the matter? Are you taken\r\nill?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d he gasped. \u201cIt is\u2014it is\u2014that I have an idea!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d I exclaimed, much relieved. \u201cOne of your \u2018little ideas\u2019?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, _ma foi_, no!\u201d replied Poirot frankly. \u201cThis time it is an idea\r\ngigantic! Stupendous! And you\u2014_you_, my friend, have given it to me!\u201d\r\n\r\nSuddenly clasping me in his arms, he kissed me warmly on both cheeks,\r\nand before I had recovered from my surprise ran headlong from the room.\r\n\r\nMary Cavendish entered at that moment.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat _is_ the matter with Monsieur Poirot? He rushed past me crying\r\nout: \u2018A garage! For the love of Heaven, direct me to a garage, madame!\u2019\r\nAnd, before I could answer, he had dashed out into the street.\u201d\r\n\r\nI hurried to the window. True enough, there he was, tearing down the\r\nstreet, hatless, and gesticulating as he went. I turned to Mary with a\r\ngesture of despair.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be stopped by a policeman in another minute. There he goes,\r\nround the corner!\u201d\r\n\r\nOur eyes met, and we stared helplessly at one another.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can be the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. He was building card houses, when suddenly he said he\r\nhad an idea, and rushed off as you saw.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Mary, \u201cI expect he will be back before dinner.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut night fell, and Poirot had not returned.\r\n\nPoirot\u2019s abrupt departure had intrigued us all greatly. Sunday morning\r\nwore away, and still he did not reappear. But about three o\u2019clock a\r\nferocious and prolonged hooting outside drove us to the window, to see\r\nPoirot alighting from a car, accompanied by Japp and Summerhaye. The\r\nlittle man was transformed. He radiated an absurd complacency. He bowed\r\nwith exaggerated respect to Mary Cavendish.\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame, I have your permission to hold a little _r\u00e9union_ in the\r\n_salon_? It is necessary for everyone to attend.\u201d\r\n\r\nMary smiled sadly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know, Monsieur Poirot, that you have _carte blanche_ in every\r\nway.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are too amiable, madame.\u201d\r\n\r\nStill beaming, Poirot marshalled us all into the drawing-room, bringing\r\nforward chairs as he did so.\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Howard\u2014here. Mademoiselle Cynthia. Monsieur Lawrence. The good\r\nDorcas. And Annie. _Bien!_ We must delay our proceedings a few minutes\r\nuntil Mr. Inglethorp arrives. I have sent him a note.\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Howard rose immediately from her seat.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf that man comes into the house, I leave it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no!\u201d Poirot went up to her and pleaded in a low voice.\r\n\r\nFinally Miss Howard consented to return to her chair. A few minutes\r\nlater Alfred Inglethorp entered the room.\r\n\r\nThe company once assembled, Poirot rose from his seat with the air of a\r\npopular lecturer, and bowed politely to his audience.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Messieurs, mesdames_, as you all know, I was called in by Monsieur\r\nJohn Cavendish to investigate this case. I at once examined the bedroom\r\nof the deceased which, by the advice of the doctors, had been kept\r\nlocked, and was consequently exactly as it had been when the tragedy\r\noccurred. I found: first, a fragment of green material; second, a stain\r\non the carpet near the window, still damp; thirdly, an empty box of\r\nbromide powders.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo take the fragment of green material first, I found it caught in the\r\nbolt of the communicating door between that room and the adjoining one\r\noccupied by Mademoiselle Cynthia. I handed the fragment over to the\r\npolice who did not consider it of much importance. Nor did they\r\nrecognize it for what it was\u2014a piece torn from a green land armlet.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a little stir of excitement.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow there was only one person at Styles who worked on the land\u2014Mrs.\r\nCavendish. Therefore it must have been Mrs. Cavendish who entered the\r\ndeceased\u2019s room through the door communicating with Mademoiselle\r\nCynthia\u2019s room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut that door was bolted on the inside!\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I examined the room, yes. But in the first place we have only her\r\nword for it, since it was she who tried that particular door and\r\nreported it fastened. In the ensuing confusion she would have had ample\r\nopportunity to shoot the bolt across. I took an early opportunity of\r\nverifying my conjectures. To begin with, the fragment corresponds\r\nexactly with a tear in Mrs. Cavendish\u2019s armlet. Also, at the inquest,\r\nMrs. Cavendish declared that she had heard, from her own room, the fall\r\nof the table by the bed. I took an early opportunity of testing that\r\nstatement by stationing my friend Monsieur Hastings in the left wing of\r\nthe building, just outside Mrs. Cavendish\u2019s door. I myself, in company\r\nwith the police, went to the deceased\u2019s room, and whilst there I,\r\napparently accidentally, knocked over the table in question, but found\r\nthat, as I had expected, Monsieur Hastings had heard no sound at all.\r\nThis confirmed my belief that Mrs. Cavendish was not speaking the truth\r\nwhen she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of\r\nthe tragedy. In fact, I was convinced that, far from having been in her\r\nown room, Mrs. Cavendish was actually in the deceased\u2019s room when the\r\nalarm was given.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shot a quick glance at Mary. She was very pale, but smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cI proceeded to reason on that assumption. Mrs. Cavendish is in her\r\nmother-in-law\u2019s room. We will say that she is seeking for something and\r\nhas not yet found it. Suddenly Mrs. Inglethorp awakens and is seized\r\nwith an alarming paroxysm. She flings out her arm, overturning the bed\r\ntable, and then pulls desperately at the bell. Mrs. Cavendish,\r\nstartled, drops her candle, scattering the grease on the carpet. She\r\npicks it up, and retreats quickly to Mademoiselle Cynthia\u2019s room,\r\nclosing the door behind her. She hurries out into the passage, for the\r\nservants must not find her where she is. But it is too late! Already\r\nfootsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings.\r\nWhat can she do? Quick as thought, she hurries back to the young girl\u2019s\r\nroom, and starts shaking her awake. The hastily aroused household come\r\ntrooping down the passage. They are all busily battering at Mrs.\r\nInglethorp\u2019s door. It occurs to nobody that Mrs. Cavendish has not\r\narrived with the rest, but\u2014and this is significant\u2014I can find no one\r\nwho saw her come from the other wing.\u201d He looked at Mary Cavendish. \u201cAm\r\nI right, madame?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite right, monsieur. You understand that, if I had thought I would\r\ndo my husband any good by revealing these facts, I would have done so.\r\nBut it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of his guilt or\r\ninnocence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn a sense, that is correct, madame. But it cleared my mind of many\r\nmisconceptions, and left me free to see other facts in their true\r\nsignificance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe will!\u201d cried Lawrence. \u201cThen it was you, Mary, who destroyed the\r\nwill?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, and Poirot shook his also.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThere is only one person who could possibly\r\nhave destroyed that will\u2014Mrs. Inglethorp herself!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cImpossible!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cShe had only made it out that very\r\nafternoon!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNevertheless, _mon ami_, it was Mrs. Inglethorp. Because, in no other\r\nway can you account for the fact that, on one of the hottest days of\r\nthe year, Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire to be lighted in her room.\u201d\r\n\r\nI gave a gasp. What idiots we had been never to think of that fire as\r\nbeing incongruous! Poirot was continuing:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe temperature on that day, messieurs, was 80 degrees in the shade.\r\nYet Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire! Why? Because she wished to destroy\r\nsomething, and could think of no other way. You will remember that, in\r\nconsequence of the War economics practiced at Styles, no waste paper\r\nwas thrown away. There was therefore no means of destroying a thick\r\ndocument such as a will. The moment I heard of a fire being lighted in\r\nMrs. Inglethorp\u2019s room, I leaped to the conclusion that it was to\r\ndestroy some important document\u2014possibly a will. So the discovery of\r\nthe charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me. I did not, of\r\ncourse, know at the time that the will in question had only been made\r\nthis afternoon, and I will admit that, when I learnt that fact, I fell\r\ninto a grievous error. I came to the conclusion that Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s\r\ndetermination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the\r\nquarrel she had that afternoon, and that therefore the quarrel took\r\nplace after, and not before the making of the will.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere, as we know, I was wrong, and I was forced to abandon that idea.\r\nI faced the problem from a new standpoint. Now, at four o\u2019clock, Dorcas\r\noverheard her mistress saying angrily: \u2018You need not think that any\r\nfear of publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.\u201d\r\nI conjectured, and conjectured rightly, that these words were\r\naddressed, not to her husband, but to Mr. John Cavendish. At five\r\no\u2019clock, an hour later, she uses almost the same words, but the\r\nstandpoint is different. She admits to Dorcas, \u2018I don\u2019t know what to\r\ndo; scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing.\u2019 At four\r\no\u2019clock she has been angry, but completely mistress of herself. At five\r\no\u2019clock she is in violent distress, and speaks of having had a great\r\nshock.\r\n\r\n\u201cLooking at the matter psychologically, I drew one deduction which I\r\nwas convinced was correct. The second \u2018scandal\u2019 she spoke of was not\r\nthe same as the first\u2014and it concerned herself!\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us reconstruct. At four o\u2019clock, Mrs. Inglethorp quarrels with her\r\nson, and threatens to denounce him to his wife\u2014who, by the way,\r\noverheard the greater part of the conversation. At four-thirty, Mrs.\r\nInglethorp, in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills,\r\nmakes a will in favour of her husband, which the two gardeners witness.\r\nAt five o\u2019clock, Dorcas finds her mistress in a state of considerable\r\nagitation, with a slip of paper\u2014\u2018a letter,\u2019 Dorcas thinks\u2014in her hand,\r\nand it is then that she orders the fire in her room to be lighted.\r\nPresumably, then, between four-thirty and five o\u2019clock, something has\r\noccurred to occasion a complete revolution of feeling, since she is now\r\nas anxious to destroy the will, as she was before to make it. What was\r\nthat something?\r\n\r\n\u201cAs far as we know, she was quite alone during that half-hour. Nobody\r\nentered or left that boudoir. What then occasioned this sudden change\r\nof sentiment?\r\n\r\n\u201cOne can only guess, but I believe my guess to be correct. Mrs.\r\nInglethorp had no stamps in her desk. We know this, because later she\r\nasked Dorcas to bring her some. Now in the opposite corner of the room\r\nstood her husband\u2019s desk\u2014locked. She was anxious to find some stamps,\r\nand, according to my theory, she tried her own keys in the desk. That\r\none of them fitted I know. She therefore opened the desk, and in\r\nsearching for the stamps she came across something else\u2014that slip of\r\npaper which Dorcas saw in her hand, and which assuredly was never meant\r\nfor Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s eyes. On the other hand, Mrs. Cavendish believed\r\nthat the slip of paper to which her mother-in-law clung so tenaciously\r\nwas a written proof of her own husband\u2019s infidelity. She demanded it\r\nfrom Mrs. Inglethorp who assured her, quite truly, that it had nothing\r\nto do with that matter. Mrs. Cavendish did not believe her. She thought\r\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp was shielding her stepson. Now Mrs. Cavendish is a\r\nvery resolute woman, and, behind her mask of reserve, she was madly\r\njealous of her husband. She determined to get hold of that paper at all\r\ncosts, and in this resolution chance came to her aid. She happened to\r\npick up the key of Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s despatch-case, which had been lost\r\nthat morning. She knew that her mother-in-law invariably kept all\r\nimportant papers in this particular case.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Cavendish, therefore, made her plans as only a woman driven\r\ndesperate through jealousy could have done. Some time in the evening\r\nshe unbolted the door leading into Mademoiselle Cynthia\u2019s room.\r\nPossibly she applied oil to the hinges, for I found that it opened\r\nquite noiselessly when I tried it. She put off her project until the\r\nearly hours of the morning as being safer, since the servants were\r\naccustomed to hearing her move about her room at that time. She dressed\r\ncompletely in her land kit, and made her way quietly through\r\nMademoiselle Cynthia\u2019s room into that of Mrs. Inglethorp.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, and Cynthia interrupted:\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I should have woken up if anyone had come through my room?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot if you were drugged, mademoiselle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDrugged?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mais, oui!_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou remember\u201d\u2014he addressed us collectively again\u2014\u201cthat through all the\r\ntumult and noise next door Mademoiselle Cynthia slept. That admitted of\r\ntwo possibilities. Either her sleep was feigned\u2014which I did not\r\nbelieve\u2014or her unconsciousness was indeed by artificial means.\r\n\r\n\u201cWith this latter idea in my mind, I examined all the coffee-cups most\r\ncarefully, remembering that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had brought\r\nMademoiselle Cynthia her coffee the night before. I took a sample from\r\neach cup, and had them analysed\u2014with no result. I had counted the cups\r\ncarefully, in the event of one having been removed. Six persons had\r\ntaken coffee, and six cups were duly found. I had to confess myself\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I discovered that I had been guilty of a very grave oversight.\r\nCoffee had been brought in for seven persons, not six, for Dr.\r\nBauerstein had been there that evening. This changed the face of the\r\nwhole affair, for there was now one cup missing. The servants noticed\r\nnothing, since Annie, the housemaid, who took in the coffee, brought in\r\nseven cups, not knowing that Mr. Inglethorp never drank it, whereas\r\nDorcas, who cleared them away the following morning, found six as\r\nusual\u2014or strictly speaking she found five, the sixth being the one\r\nfound broken in Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s room.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was confident that the missing cup was that of Mademoiselle Cynthia.\r\nI had an additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the\r\ncups found contained sugar, which Mademoiselle Cynthia never took in\r\nher coffee. My attention was attracted by the story of Annie about some\r\n\u2018salt\u2019 on the tray of cocoa which she took every night to Mrs.\r\nInglethorp\u2019s room. I accordingly secured a sample of that cocoa, and\r\nsent it to be analysed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut that had already been done by Dr. Bauerstein,\u201d said Lawrence\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot exactly. The analyst was asked by him to report whether strychnine\r\nwas, or was not, present. He did not have it tested, as I did, for a\r\nnarcotic.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor a narcotic?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Here is the analyst\u2019s report. Mrs. Cavendish administered a safe,\r\nbut effectual, narcotic to both Mrs. Inglethorp and Mademoiselle\r\nCynthia. And it is possible that she had a _mauvais quart d\u2019heure_ in\r\nconsequence! Imagine her feelings when her mother-in-law is suddenly\r\ntaken ill and dies, and immediately after she hears the word \u2018Poison\u2019!\r\nShe has believed that the sleeping draught she administered was\r\nperfectly harmless, but there is no doubt that for one terrible moment\r\nshe must have feared that Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s death lay at her door. She\r\nis seized with panic, and under its influence she hurries downstairs,\r\nand quickly drops the coffee-cup and saucer used by Mademoiselle\r\nCynthia into a large brass vase, where it is discovered later by\r\nMonsieur Lawrence. The remains of the cocoa she dare not touch. Too\r\nmany eyes are upon her. Guess at her relief when strychnine is\r\nmentioned, and she discovers that after all the tragedy is not her\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are now able to account for the symptoms of strychnine poisoning\r\nbeing so long in making their appearance. A narcotic taken with\r\nstrychnine will delay the action of the poison for some hours.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot paused. Mary looked up at him, the colour slowly rising in her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll you have said is quite true, Monsieur Poirot. It was the most\r\nawful hour of my life. I shall never forget it. But you are wonderful.\r\nI understand now\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I meant when I told you that you could safely confess to Papa\r\nPoirot, eh? But you would not trust me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see everything now,\u201d said Lawrence. \u201cThe drugged cocoa, taken on top\r\nof the poisoned coffee, amply accounts for the delay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. But was the coffee poisoned, or was it not? We come to a\r\nlittle difficulty here, since Mrs. Inglethorp never drank it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The cry of surprise was universal.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. You will remember my speaking of a stain on the carpet in Mrs.\r\nInglethorp\u2019s room? There were some peculiar points about that stain. It\r\nwas still damp, it exhaled a strong odour of coffee, and imbedded in\r\nthe nap of the carpet I found some little splinters of china. What had\r\nhappened was plain to me, for not two minutes before I had placed my\r\nlittle case on the table near the window, and the table, tilting up,\r\nhad deposited it upon the floor on precisely the identical spot. In\r\nexactly the same way, Mrs. Inglethorp had laid down her cup of coffee\r\non reaching her room the night before, and the treacherous table had\r\nplayed her the same trick.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat happened next is mere guess work on my part, but I should say\r\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp picked up the broken cup and placed it on the\r\ntable by the bed. Feeling in need of a stimulant of some kind, she\r\nheated up her cocoa, and drank it off then and there. Now we are faced\r\nwith a new problem. We know the cocoa contained no strychnine. The\r\ncoffee was never drunk. Yet the strychnine must have been administered\r\nbetween seven and nine o\u2019clock that evening. What third medium was\r\nthere\u2014a medium so suitable for disguising the taste of strychnine that\r\nit is extraordinary no one has thought of it?\u201d Poirot looked round the\r\nroom, and then answered himself impressively. \u201cHer medicine!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean that the murderer introduced the strychnine into her\r\ntonic?\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was no need to introduce it. It was already there\u2014in the\r\nmixture. The strychnine that killed Mrs. Inglethorp was the identical\r\nstrychnine prescribed by Dr. Wilkins. To make that clear to you, I will\r\nread you an extract from a book on dispensing which I found in the\r\nDispensary of the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The following prescription has become famous in text books:\r\n\r\n\r\n          Strychninae Sulph. . . . . . 1 gr.\r\n\r\n          Potass Bromide . . . . . . . 3vi\r\n\r\n          Aqua ad. . . . . . . . . . . . . 3viii\r\n\r\n          Fiat Mistura\r\n\r\n\r\n_This solution deposits in a few hours the greater part of the\r\nstrychnine salt as an insoluble bromide in transparent crystals. A lady\r\nin England lost her life by taking a similar mixture: the precipitated\r\nstrychnine collected at the bottom, and in taking the last dose she\r\nswallowed nearly all of it!_\r\n\r\n\u201cNow there was, of course, no bromide in Dr. Wilkins\u2019 prescription, but\r\nyou will remember that I mentioned an empty box of bromide powders. One\r\nor two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine\r\nwould effectually precipitate the strychnine, as the book describes,\r\nand cause it to be taken in the last dose. You will learn later that\r\nthe person who usually poured out Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s medicine was always\r\nextremely careful not to shake the bottle, but to leave the sediment at\r\nthe bottom of it undisturbed.\r\n\r\n\u201cThroughout the case, there have been evidences that the tragedy was\r\nintended to take place on Monday evening. On that day, Mrs.\r\nInglethorp\u2019s bell wire was neatly cut, and on Monday evening\r\nMademoiselle Cynthia was spending the night with friends, so that Mrs.\r\nInglethorp would have been quite alone in the right wing, completely\r\nshut off from help of any kind, and would have died, in all\r\nprobability, before medical aid could have been summoned. But in her\r\nhurry to be in time for the village entertainment Mrs. Inglethorp\r\nforgot to take her medicine, and the next day she lunched away from\r\nhome, so that the last\u2014and fatal\u2014dose was actually taken twenty-four\r\nhours later than had been anticipated by the murderer; and it is owing\r\nto that delay that the final proof\u2014the last link of the chain\u2014is now in\r\nmy hands.\u201d\r\n\r\nAmid breathless excitement, he held out three thin strips of paper.\r\n\r\n\u201cA letter in the murderer\u2019s own hand-writing, _mes amis!_ Had it been a\r\nlittle clearer in its terms, it is possible that Mrs. Inglethorp,\r\nwarned in time, would have escaped. As it was, she realized her danger,\r\nbut not the manner of it.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the deathly silence, Poirot pieced together the slips of paper and,\r\nclearing his throat, read:\r\n\r\nDearest Evelyn:\r\n\r\n    \u2018You will be anxious at hearing nothing. It is all right\u2014only it\r\n    will be to-night instead of last night. You understand. There\u2019s a\r\n    good time coming once the old woman is dead and out of the way. No\r\n    one can possibly bring home the crime to me. That idea of yours\r\n    about the bromides was a stroke of genius! But we must be very\r\n    circumspect. A false step\u2014\u2014\u2019\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cHere, my friends, the letter breaks off. Doubtless the writer was\r\ninterrupted; but there can be no question as to his identity. We all\r\nknow this hand-writing and\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nA howl that was almost a scream broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou devil! How did you get it?\u201d\r\n\r\nA chair was overturned. Poirot skipped nimbly aside. A quick movement\r\non his part, and his assailant fell with a crash.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Messieurs, mesdames_,\u201d said Poirot, with a flourish, \u201clet me\r\nintroduce you to the murderer, Mr. Alfred Inglethorp!\u201d\r\n\n\u201cPoirot, you old villain,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ve half a mind to strangle you!\r\nWhat do you mean by deceiving me as you have done?\u201d\r\n\r\nWe were sitting in the library. Several hectic days lay behind us. In\r\nthe room below, John and Mary were together once more, while Alfred\r\nInglethorp and Miss Howard were in custody. Now at last, I had Poirot\r\nto myself, and could relieve my still burning curiosity.\r\n\r\nPoirot did not answer me for a moment, but at last he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cI did not deceive you, _mon ami_. At most, I permitted you to deceive\r\nyourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it is difficult to explain. You see, my friend, you have a\r\nnature so honest, and a countenance so transparent, that\u2014_enfin_, to\r\nconceal your feelings is impossible! If I had told you my ideas, the\r\nvery first time you saw Mr. Alfred Inglethorp that astute gentleman\r\nwould have\u2014in your so expressive idiom\u2014\u2018smelt a rat\u2019! And then,\r\n_bonjour_ to our chances of catching him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that I have more diplomacy than you give me credit for.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy friend,\u201d besought Poirot, \u201cI implore you, do not enrage yourself!\r\nYour help has been of the most invaluable. It is but the extremely\r\nbeautiful nature that you have, which made me pause.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I grumbled, a little mollified. \u201cI still think you might have\r\ngiven me a hint.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I did, my friend. Several hints. You would not take them. Think\r\nnow, did I ever say to you that I believed John Cavendish guilty? Did I\r\nnot, on the contrary, tell you that he would almost certainly be\r\nacquitted?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd did I not immediately afterwards speak of the difficulty of\r\nbringing the murderer to justice? Was it not plain to you that I was\r\nspeaking of two entirely different persons?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cit was not plain to me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen again,\u201d continued Poirot, \u201cat the beginning, did I not repeat to\r\nyou several times that I didn\u2019t want Mr. Inglethorp arrested _now_?\r\nThat should have conveyed something to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean to say you suspected him as long ago as that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. To begin with, whoever else might benefit by Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s\r\ndeath, her husband would benefit the most. There was no getting away\r\nfrom that. When I went up to Styles with you that first day, I had no\r\nidea as to how the crime had been committed, but from what I knew of\r\nMr. Inglethorp I fancied that it would be very hard to find anything to\r\nconnect him with it. When I arrived at the ch\u00e2teau, I realized at once\r\nthat it was Mrs. Inglethorp who had burnt the will; and there, by the\r\nway, you cannot complain, my friend, for I tried my best to force on\r\nyou the significance of that bedroom fire in midsummer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d I said impatiently. \u201cGo on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, my friend, as I say, my views as to Mr. Inglethorp\u2019s guilt were\r\nvery much shaken. There was, in fact, so much evidence against him that\r\nI was inclined to believe that he had not done it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did you change your mind?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I found that the more efforts I made to clear him, the more\r\nefforts he made to get himself arrested. Then, when I discovered that\r\nInglethorp had nothing to do with Mrs. Raikes and that in fact it was\r\nJohn Cavendish who was interested in that quarter, I was quite sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSimply this. If it had been Inglethorp who was carrying on an intrigue\r\nwith Mrs. Raikes, his silence was perfectly comprehensible. But, when I\r\ndiscovered that it was known all over the village that it was John who\r\nwas attracted by the farmer\u2019s pretty wife, his silence bore quite a\r\ndifferent interpretation. It was nonsense to pretend that he was afraid\r\nof the scandal, as no possible scandal could attach to him. This\r\nattitude of his gave me furiously to think, and I was slowly forced to\r\nthe conclusion that Alfred Inglethorp wanted to be arrested. _Eh bien!_\r\nfrom that moment, I was equally determined that he should not be\r\narrested.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWait a minute. I don\u2019t see why he wished to be arrested?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause, _mon ami_, it is the law of your country that a man once\r\nacquitted can never be tried again for the same offence. Aha! but it\r\nwas clever\u2014his idea! Assuredly, he is a man of method. See here, he\r\nknew that in his position he was bound to be suspected, so he conceived\r\nthe exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence\r\nagainst himself. He wished to be arrested. He would then produce his\r\nirreproachable alibi\u2014and, hey presto, he was safe for life!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I still don\u2019t see how he managed to prove his alibi, and yet go to\r\nthe chemist\u2019s shop?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot stared at me in surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it possible? My poor friend! You have not yet realized that it was\r\nMiss Howard who went to the chemist\u2019s shop?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Howard?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, certainly. Who else? It was most easy for her. She is of a good\r\nheight, her voice is deep and manly; moreover, remember, she and\r\nInglethorp are cousins, and there is a distinct resemblance between\r\nthem, especially in their gait and bearing. It was simplicity itself.\r\nThey are a clever pair!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was\r\ndone,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Bon!_ I will reconstruct for you as far as possible. I am inclined to\r\nthink that Miss Howard was the master mind in that affair. You remember\r\nher once mentioning that her father was a doctor? Possibly she\r\ndispensed his medicines for him, or she may have taken the idea from\r\none of the many books lying about when Mademoiselle Cynthia was\r\nstudying for her exam. Anyway, she was familiar with the fact that the\r\naddition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause\r\nthe precipitation of the latter. Probably the idea came to her quite\r\nsuddenly. Mrs. Inglethorp had a box of bromide powders, which she\r\noccasionally took at night. What could be easier than quietly to\r\ndissolve one or more of those powders in Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s large sized\r\nbottle of medicine when it came from Coot\u2019s? The risk is practically\r\nnil. The tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later. If\r\nanyone has seen either of them touching the medicine, they will have\r\nforgotten it by that time. Miss Howard will have engineered her\r\nquarrel, and departed from the house. The lapse of time, and her\r\nabsence, will defeat all suspicion. Yes, it was a clever idea! If they\r\nhad left it alone, it is possible the crime might never have been\r\nbrought home to them. But they were not satisfied. They tried to be too\r\nclever\u2014and that was their undoing.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot puffed at his tiny cigarette, his eyes fixed on the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey arranged a plan to throw suspicion on John Cavendish, by buying\r\nstrychnine at the village chemist\u2019s, and signing the register in his\r\nhand-writing.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn Monday Mrs. Inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicine. On\r\nMonday, therefore, at six o\u2019clock, Alfred Inglethorp arranges to be\r\nseen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village. Miss\r\nHoward has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and Mrs.\r\nRaikes to account for his holding his tongue afterwards. At six\r\no\u2019clock, Miss Howard, disguised as Alfred Inglethorp, enters the\r\nchemist\u2019s shop, with her story about a dog, obtains the strychnine, and\r\nwrites the name of Alfred Inglethorp in John\u2019s handwriting, which she\r\nhad previously studied carefully.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, as it will never do if John, too, can prove an alibi, she writes\r\nhim an anonymous note\u2014still copying his hand-writing\u2014which takes him to\r\na remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo far, all goes well. Miss Howard goes back to Middlingham. Alfred\r\nInglethorp returns to Styles. There is nothing that can compromise him\r\nin any way, since it is Miss Howard who has the strychnine, which,\r\nafter all, is only wanted as a blind to throw suspicion on John\r\nCavendish.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut now a hitch occurs. Mrs. Inglethorp does not take her medicine\r\nthat night. The broken bell, Cynthia\u2019s absence\u2014arranged by Inglethorp\r\nthrough his wife\u2014all these are wasted. And then\u2014he makes his slip.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Inglethorp is out, and he sits down to write to his accomplice,\r\nwho, he fears, may be in a panic at the non-success of their plan. It\r\nis probable that Mrs. Inglethorp returned earlier than he expected.\r\nCaught in the act, and somewhat flurried he hastily shuts and locks his\r\ndesk. He fears that if he remains in the room he may have to open it\r\nagain, and that Mrs. Inglethorp might catch sight of the letter before\r\nhe could snatch it up. So he goes out and walks in the woods, little\r\ndreaming that Mrs. Inglethorp will open his desk, and discover the\r\nincriminating document.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut this, as we know, is what happened. Mrs. Inglethorp reads it, and\r\nbecomes aware of the perfidy of her husband and Evelyn Howard, though,\r\nunfortunately, the sentence about the bromides conveys no warning to\r\nher mind. She knows that she is in danger\u2014but is ignorant of where the\r\ndanger lies. She decides to say nothing to her husband, but sits down\r\nand writes to her solicitor, asking him to come on the morrow, and she\r\nalso determines to destroy immediately the will which she has just\r\nmade. She keeps the fatal letter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was to discover that letter, then, that her husband forced the lock\r\nof the despatch-case?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and from the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he\r\nrealized its importance. That letter excepted, there was absolutely\r\nnothing to connect him with the crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing I can\u2019t make out, why didn\u2019t he destroy it at\r\nonce when he got hold of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause he did not dare take the biggest risk of all\u2014that of keeping\r\nit on his own person.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLook at it from his point of view. I have discovered that there were\r\nonly five short minutes in which he could have taken it\u2014the five\r\nminutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene, for before\r\nthat time Annie was brushing the stairs, and would have seen anyone who\r\npassed going to the right wing. Figure to yourself the scene! He enters\r\nthe room, unlocking the door by means of one of the other doorkeys\u2014they\r\nwere all much alike. He hurries to the despatch-case\u2014it is locked, and\r\nthe keys are nowhere to be seen. That is a terrible blow to him, for it\r\nmeans that his presence in the room cannot be concealed as he had\r\nhoped. But he sees clearly that everything must be risked for the sake\r\nof that damning piece of evidence. Quickly, he forces the lock with a\r\npenknife, and turns over the papers until he finds what he is looking\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut now a fresh dilemma arises: he dare not keep that piece of paper\r\non him. He may be seen leaving the room\u2014he may be searched. If the\r\npaper is found on him, it is certain doom. Probably, at this minute,\r\ntoo, he hears the sounds below of Mr. Wells and John leaving the\r\nboudoir. He must act quickly. Where can he hide this terrible slip of\r\npaper? The contents of the waste-paper-basket are kept and in any case,\r\nare sure to be examined. There are no means of destroying it; and he\r\ndare not keep it. He looks round, and he sees\u2014what do you think, _mon\r\nami?_\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn a moment, he has torn the letter into long thin strips, and rolling\r\nthem up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other\r\nspills in the vase on the mantle-piece.\u201d\r\n\r\nI uttered an exclamation.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo one would think of looking there,\u201d Poirot continued. \u201cAnd he will\r\nbe able, at his leisure, to come back and destroy this solitary piece\r\nof evidence against him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, all the time, it was in the spill vase in Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s\r\nbedroom, under our very noses?\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, my friend. That is where I discovered my \u2018last link,\u2019 and I owe\r\nthat very fortunate discovery to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Do you remember telling me that my hand shook as I was\r\nstraightening the ornaments on the mantelpiece?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t see\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but I saw. Do you know, my friend, I remembered that earlier in\r\nthe morning, when we had been there together, I had straightened all\r\nthe objects on the mantelpiece. And, if they were already straightened,\r\nthere would be no need to straighten them again, unless, in the\r\nmeantime, someone else had touched them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me,\u201d I murmured, \u201cso that is the explanation of your\r\nextraordinary behaviour. You rushed down to Styles, and found it still\r\nthere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and it was a race for time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I still can\u2019t understand why Inglethorp was such a fool as to\r\nleave it there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, but he had no opportunity. _I_ saw to that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Do you remember reproving me for taking the household into my\r\nconfidence on the subject?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, my friend, I saw there was just one chance. I was not sure then\r\nif Inglethorp was the criminal or not, but if he was I reasoned that he\r\nwould not have the paper on him, but would have hidden it somewhere,\r\nand by enlisting the sympathy of the household I could effectually\r\nprevent his destroying it. He was already under suspicion, and by\r\nmaking the matter public I secured the services of about ten amateur\r\ndetectives, who would be watching him unceasingly, and being himself\r\naware of their watchfulness he would not dare seek further to destroy\r\nthe document. He was therefore forced to depart from the house, leaving\r\nit in the spill vase.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut surely Miss Howard had ample opportunities of aiding him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but Miss Howard did not know of the paper\u2019s existence. In\r\naccordance with their prearranged plan, she never spoke to Alfred\r\nInglethorp. They were supposed to be deadly enemies, and until John\r\nCavendish was safely convicted they neither of them dared risk a\r\nmeeting. Of course I had a watch kept on Mr. Inglethorp, hoping that\r\nsooner or later he would lead me to the hiding-place. But he was too\r\nclever to take any chances. The paper was safe where it was; since no\r\none had thought of looking there in the first week, it was not likely\r\nthey would do so afterwards. But for your lucky remark, we might never\r\nhave been able to bring him to justice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI understand that now; but when did you first begin to suspect Miss\r\nHoward?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I discovered that she had told a lie at the inquest about the\r\nletter she had received from Mrs. Inglethorp.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, what was there to lie about?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou saw that letter? Do you recall its general appearance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014more or less.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will recollect, then, that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote a very\r\ndistinctive hand, and left large clear spaces between her words. But if\r\nyou look at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that\r\n\u2018July 17th\u2019 is quite different in this respect. Do you see what I\r\nmean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I confessed, \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do not see that that letter was not written on the 17th, but on\r\nthe 7th\u2014the day after Miss Howard\u2019s departure? The \u20181\u2019 was written in\r\nbefore the \u20187\u2019 to turn it into the \u201817th\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is exactly what I asked myself. Why does Miss Howard suppress the\r\nletter written on the 17th, and produce this faked one instead? Because\r\nshe did not wish to show the letter of the 17th. Why, again? And at\r\nonce a suspicion dawned in my mind. You will remember my saying that it\r\nwas wise to beware of people who were not telling you the truth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d I cried indignantly, \u201cafter that, you gave me two reasons\r\nwhy Miss Howard could not have committed the crime!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd very good reasons too,\u201d replied Poirot. \u201cFor a long time they were\r\na stumbling-block to me until I remembered a very significant fact:\r\nthat she and Alfred Inglethorp were cousins. She could not have\r\ncommitted the crime single-handed, but the reasons against that did not\r\ndebar her from being an accomplice. And, then, there was that rather\r\nover-vehement hatred of hers! It concealed a very opposite emotion.\r\nThere was, undoubtedly, a tie of passion between them long before he\r\ncame to Styles. They had already arranged their infamous plot\u2014that he\r\nshould marry this rich, but rather foolish old lady, induce her to make\r\na will leaving her money to him, and then gain their ends by a very\r\ncleverly conceived crime. If all had gone as they planned, they would\r\nprobably have left England, and lived together on their poor victim\u2019s\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are a very astute and unscrupulous pair. While suspicion was to\r\nbe directed against him, she would be making quiet preparations for a\r\nvery different _d\u00e9nouement_. She arrives from Middlingham with all the\r\ncompromising items in her possession. No suspicion attaches to her. No\r\nnotice is paid to her coming and going in the house. She hides the\r\nstrychnine and glasses in John\u2019s room. She puts the beard in the attic.\r\nShe will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t quite see why they tried to fix the blame on John,\u201d I\r\nremarked. \u201cIt would have been much easier for them to bring the crime\r\nhome to Lawrence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but that was mere chance. All the evidence against him arose out\r\nof pure accident. It must, in fact, have been distinctly annoying to\r\nthe pair of schemers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHis manner was unfortunate,\u201d I observed thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. You realize, of course, what was at the back of that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did not understand that he believed Mademoiselle Cynthia guilty of\r\nthe crime?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I exclaimed, astonished. \u201cImpossible!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. I myself nearly had the same idea. It was in my mind when\r\nI asked Mr. Wells that first question about the will. Then there were\r\nthe bromide powders which she had made up, and her clever male\r\nimpersonations, as Dorcas recounted them to us. There was really more\r\nevidence against her than anyone else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are joking, Poirot!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. Shall I tell you what made Monsieur Lawrence turn so pale when he\r\nfirst entered his mother\u2019s room on the fatal night? It was because,\r\nwhilst his mother lay there, obviously poisoned, he saw, over your\r\nshoulder, that the door into Mademoiselle Cynthia\u2019s room was unbolted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut he declared that he saw it bolted!\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Poirot dryly. \u201cAnd that was just what confirmed my\r\nsuspicion that it was not. He was shielding Mademoiselle Cynthia.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why should he shield her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause he is in love with her.\u201d\r\n\r\nI laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, Poirot, you are quite wrong! I happen to know for a fact that,\r\nfar from being in love with her, he positively dislikes her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho told you that, _mon ami?_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCynthia herself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_La pauvre petite!_ And she was concerned?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe said that she did not mind at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen she certainly did mind very much,\u201d remarked Poirot. \u201cThey are\r\nlike that\u2014_les femmes!_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat you say about Lawrence is a great surprise to me,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why? It was most obvious. Did not Monsieur Lawrence make the sour\r\nface every time Mademoiselle Cynthia spoke and laughed with his\r\nbrother? He had taken it into his long head that Mademoiselle Cynthia\r\nwas in love with Monsieur John. When he entered his mother\u2019s room, and\r\nsaw her obviously poisoned, he jumped to the conclusion that\r\nMademoiselle Cynthia knew something about the matter. He was nearly\r\ndriven desperate. First he crushed the coffee-cup to powder under his\r\nfeet, remembering that _she_ had gone up with his mother the night\r\nbefore, and he determined that there should be no chance of testing its\r\ncontents. Thenceforward, he strenuously, and quite uselessly, upheld\r\nthe theory of \u2018Death from natural causes\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what about the \u2018extra coffee-cup\u2019?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was fairly certain that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had hidden it, but\r\nI had to make sure. Monsieur Lawrence did not know at all what I meant;\r\nbut, on reflection, he came to the conclusion that if he could find an\r\nextra coffee-cup anywhere his lady love would be cleared of suspicion.\r\nAnd he was perfectly right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne thing more. What did Mrs. Inglethorp mean by her dying words?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey were, of course, an accusation against her husband.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me, Poirot,\u201d I said with a sigh, \u201cI think you have explained\r\neverything. I am glad it has all ended so happily. Even John and his\r\nwife are reconciled.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThanks to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you mean\u2014thanks to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear friend, do you not realize that it was simply and solely the\r\ntrial which has brought them together again? That John Cavendish still\r\nloved his wife, I was convinced. Also, that she was equally in love\r\nwith him. But they had drifted very far apart. It all arose from a\r\nmisunderstanding. She married him without love. He knew it. He is a\r\nsensitive man in his way, he would not force himself upon her if she\r\ndid not want him. And, as he withdrew, her love awoke. But they are\r\nboth unusually proud, and their pride held them inexorably apart. He\r\ndrifted into an entanglement with Mrs. Raikes, and she deliberately\r\ncultivated the friendship of Dr. Bauerstein. Do you remember the day of\r\nJohn Cavendish\u2019s arrest, when you found me deliberating over a big\r\ndecision?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I quite understood your distress.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPardon me, _mon ami_, but you did not understand it in the least. I\r\nwas trying to decide whether or not I would clear John Cavendish at\r\nonce. I could have cleared him\u2014though it might have meant a failure to\r\nconvict the real criminals. They were entirely in the dark as to my\r\nreal attitude up to the very last moment\u2014which partly accounts for my\r\nsuccess.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean that you could have saved John Cavendish from being\r\nbrought to trial?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, my friend. But I eventually decided in favour of \u2018a woman\u2019s\r\nhappiness\u2019. Nothing but the great danger through which they have passed\r\ncould have brought these two proud souls together again.\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked at Poirot in silent amazement. The colossal cheek of the\r\nlittle man! Who on earth but Poirot would have thought of a trial for\r\nmurder as a restorer of conjugal happiness!\r\n\r\n\u201cI perceive your thoughts, _mon ami_,\u201d said Poirot, smiling at me. \u201cNo\r\none but Hercule Poirot would have attempted such a thing! And you are\r\nwrong in condemning it. The happiness of one man and one woman is the\r\ngreatest thing in all the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis words took me back to earlier events. I remembered Mary as she lay\r\nwhite and exhausted on the sofa, listening, listening. There had come\r\nthe sound of the bell below. She had started up. Poirot had opened the\r\ndoor, and meeting her agonized eyes had nodded gently. \u201cYes, madame,\u201d\r\nhe said. \u201cI have brought him back to you.\u201d He had stood aside, and as I\r\nwent out I had seen the look in Mary\u2019s eyes, as John Cavendish had\r\ncaught his wife in his arms.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you are right, Poirot,\u201d I said gently. \u201cYes, it is the\r\ngreatest thing in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nSuddenly, there was a tap at the door, and Cynthia peeped in.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2014I only\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in,\u201d I said, springing up.\r\n\r\nShe came in, but did not sit down.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2014only wanted to tell you something\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\nCynthia fidgeted with a little tassel for some moments, then, suddenly\r\nexclaiming: \u201cYou dears!\u201d kissed first me and then Poirot, and rushed\r\nout of the room again.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat on earth does this mean?\u201d I asked, surprised.\r\n\r\nIt was very nice to be kissed by Cynthia, but the publicity of the\r\nsalute rather impaired the pleasure.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt means that she has discovered Monsieur Lawrence does not dislike\r\nher as much as she thought,\u201d replied Poirot philosophically.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere he is.\u201d\r\n\r\nLawrence at that moment passed the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cEh! Monsieur Lawrence,\u201d called Poirot. \u201cWe must congratulate you, is\r\nit not so?\u201d\r\n\r\nLawrence blushed, and then smiled awkwardly. A man in love is a sorry\r\nspectacle. Now Cynthia had looked charming.\r\n\r\nI sighed.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it, _mon ami?_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d I said sadly. \u201cThey are two delightful women!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd neither of them is for you?\u201d finished Poirot. \u201cNever mind. Console\r\nyourself, my friend. We may hunt together again, who knows? And then\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\n", "The Man in the Brown Suit": "Nadina, the Russian dancer who had taken Paris by storm, swayed to\r\nthe sound of the applause, bowed and bowed again. Her narrow black\r\neyes narrowed themselves still more, the long line of her scarlet\r\nmouth curved faintly upwards. Enthusiastic Frenchmen continued to\r\nbeat the ground appreciatively as the curtain fell with a swish,\r\nhiding the reds and blues and magentas of the bizarre _d\u00e9cors._ In\r\na swirl of blue and orange draperies the dancer left the stage. A\r\nbearded gentleman received her enthusiastically in his arms. It\r\nwas the Manager.\r\n\r\n\u201cMagnificent, _petite,_ magnificent,\u201d he cried. \u201cTo-night you have\r\nsurpassed yourself.\u201d He kissed her gallantly on both cheeks in a\r\nsomewhat matter-of-fact manner.\r\n\r\nMadame Nadina accepted the tribute with the ease of long habit and\r\npassed on to her dressing-room, where bouquets were heaped\r\ncarelessly everywhere, marvellous garments of futuristic design\r\nhung on pegs, and the air was hot and sweet with the scent of the\r\nmassed blossoms and with more sophisticated perfumes and essences.\r\nJeanne, the dresser, ministered to her mistress, talking incessantly\r\nand pouring out a stream of fulsome compliment.\r\n\r\nA knock at the door interrupted the flow. Jeanne went to answer\r\nit, and returned with a card in her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame will receive?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me see.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dancer stretched out a languid hand, but at the sight of the\r\nname on the card, \u201cCount Sergius Paulovitch,\u201d a sudden flicker of\r\ninterest came into her eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will see him. The maize _peignoir,_ Jeanne, and quickly. And\r\nwhen the Count comes you may go.\u201d\r\n\r\n_\u201cBien, Madame.\u201d_\r\n\r\nJeanne brought the _peignoir,_ an exquisite wisp of corn-coloured\r\nchiffon and ermine. Nadina slipped into it, and sat smiling to\r\nherself, whilst one long white hand beat a slow tattoo on the glass\r\nof the dressing-table.\r\n\r\nThe Count was prompt to avail himself of the privilege accorded to\r\nhim\u2014a man of medium height, very slim, very elegant, very pale,\r\nextraordinarily weary. In feature, little to take hold of, a man\r\ndifficult to recognize again if one left his mannerisms out of\r\naccount. He bowed over the dancer\u2019s hand with exaggerated\r\ncourtliness.\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame, this is a pleasure indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo much Jeanne heard before she went out closing the door behind\r\nher. Alone with her visitor, a subtle change came over Nadina\u2019s\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\u201cCompatriots though we are, we will not speak Russian, I think,\u201d\r\nshe observed.\r\n\r\n\u201cSince we neither of us know a word of the language, it might be\r\nas well,\u201d agreed her guest.\r\n\r\nBy common consent, they dropped into English, and nobody, now that\r\nthe Count\u2019s mannerisms had dropped from him, could doubt that it\r\nwas his native language. He had, indeed, started life as a\r\nquick-change music-hall artiste in London.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou had a great success to-night,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI congratulate\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll the same,\u201d said the woman, \u201cI am disturbed. My position is\r\nnot what it was. The suspicions aroused during the War have never\r\ndied down. I am continually watched and spied upon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut no charge of espionage was ever brought against you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOur chief lays his plans too carefully for that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLong life to the \u2018Colonel,\u2019\u201d said the Count, smiling. \u201cAmazing\r\nnews, is it not, that he means to retire? To retire! Just like a\r\ndoctor, or a butcher, or a plumber\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOr any other business man,\u201d finished Nadina. \u201cIt should not\r\nsurprise us. That is what the \u2018Colonel\u2019 has always been\u2014an excellent\r\nman of business. He has organized crime as another man might\r\norganize a boot factory. Without committing himself, he has planned\r\nand directed a series of stupendous _coups,_ embracing every branch\r\nof what we might call his \u2018profession.\u2019 Jewel robberies, forgery,\r\nespionage (the latter very profitable in war-time), sabotage,\r\ndiscreet assassination, there is hardly anything he has not touched.\r\nWisest of all, he knows when to stop. The game begins to be\r\ndangerous? \u2014he retires gracefully\u2014with an enormous fortune!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cH\u2019m!\u201d said the Count doubtfully. \u201cIt is rather\u2014upsetting for all\r\nof us. We are at a loose end, as it were.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut we are being paid off\u2014on a most generous scale!\u201d Something,\r\nsome undercurrent of mockery in her tone, made the man look at her\r\nsharply. She was smiling to herself, and the quality of her smile\r\naroused his curiosity. But he proceeded diplomatically:\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, the \u2018Colonel\u2019 has always been a generous paymaster. I\r\nattribute much of his success to that\u2014and to his invariable plan\r\nof providing a suitable scapegoat. A great brain, undoubtedly a\r\ngreat brain! And an apostle of the maxim, \u2018If you want a thing done\r\nsafely, do not do it yourself!\u2019 Here are we, every one of us\r\nincriminated up to the hilt and absolutely in his power, and not\r\none of us has anything on him.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe paused, almost as though he were expecting her to disagree with\r\nhim, but she remained silent, smiling to herself as before.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot one of us,\u201d he mused. \u201cStill, you know, he is superstitious,\r\nthe old man. Years ago, I believe, he went to one of these\r\nfortune-telling people. She prophesied a lifetime of success, but\r\ndeclared that his downfall would be brought about through a woman.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe had interested her now. She looked up eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is strange, very strange! Through a woman, you say?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe smiled and shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cDoubtless, now that he has\u2014retired, he will marry. Some young\r\nsociety beauty, who will disperse his millions faster than he\r\nacquired them.\u201d\r\n\r\nNadina shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, that is not the way of it. Listen, my friend, to-morrow\r\nI go to London.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut your contract here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall be away only one night. And I go incognito, like Royalty.\r\nNo one will ever know that I have left France. And why do you think\r\nthat I go?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHardly for pleasure at this time of year. January, a detestable\r\nfoggy month! It must be for profit, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d She rose and stood in front of him, every graceful line\r\nof her arrogant with pride. \u201cYou said just now that none of us had\r\nanything on the chief. You were wrong. I have. I, a woman, have\r\nhad the wit and, yes, the courage\u2014for it needs courage\u2014to\r\ndouble-cross him. You remember the De Beer diamonds?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I remember. At Kimberley, just before the war broke out? I\r\nhad nothing to do with it, and I never heard the details, the case\r\nwas hushed up for some reason, was it not? A fine haul too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA hundred thousand pounds worth of stones. Two of us worked\r\nit\u2014under the \u2018Colonel\u2019s\u2019 orders, of course. And it was then that\r\nI saw my chance. You see, the plan was to substitute some of the\r\nDe Beer diamonds for some sample diamonds brought from South\r\nAmerica by two young prospectors who happened to be in Kimberley\r\nat the time. Suspicion was then bound to fall on them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery clever,\u201d interpolated the Count approvingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe \u2018Colonel\u2019 is always clever. Well, I did my part\u2014but I also\r\ndid one thing which the \u2018Colonel\u2019 had not foreseen. I kept back\r\nsome of the South American stones\u2014one or two are unique and could\r\neasily be proved never to have passed through De Beer\u2019s hands. With\r\nthese diamonds in my possession, I have the whip-hand of my esteemed\r\nchief. Once the two young men are cleared, his part in the matter\r\nis bound to be suspected. I have said nothing all these years, I\r\nhave been content to know that I had this weapon in reserve, but\r\nnow matters are different. I want my price\u2014and it will be a big,\r\nI might almost say a staggering price.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExtraordinary,\u201d said the Count. \u201cAnd doubtless you carry these\r\ndiamonds about with you everywhere?\u201d\r\n\r\nHis eyes roamed gently round the disordered room.\r\n\r\nNadina laughed softly. \u201cYou need suppose nothing of the sort. I am\r\nnot a fool. The diamonds are in a safe place where no one will\r\ndream of looking for them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never thought you a fool, my dear lady, but may I venture to\r\nsuggest that you are somewhat foolhardy? The \u2018Colonel\u2019 is not the\r\ntype of man to take kindly to being blackmailed, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am not afraid of him,\u201d she laughed. \u201cThere is only one man I\r\nhave ever feared\u2014and he is dead.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man looked at her curiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us hope that he will not come to life again, then,\u201d he remarked\r\nlightly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d cried the dancer sharply.\r\n\r\nThe Count looked slightly surprised.\r\n\r\n\u201cI only meant that a resurrection would be awkward for you,\u201d he\r\nexplained. \u201cA foolish joke.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe gave a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, he is dead all right. Killed in the war. He was a man who\r\nonce\u2014loved me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn South Africa?\u201d asked the Count negligently.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, since you ask it, in South Africa.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is your native country, is it not?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe nodded. Her visitor rose and reached for his hat.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he remarked, \u201cyou know your own business best, but, if I\r\nwere you, I should fear the \u2018Colonel\u2019 far more than any disillusioned\r\nlover. He is a man whom it is particularly easy to\u2014underestimate.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe laughed scornfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs if I did not know him after all these years!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder if you do?\u201d he said softly. \u201cI very much wonder if you\r\ndo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I am not a fool! And I am not alone in this. The South African\r\nmail-boat docks at Southampton to-morrow, and on board her is a\r\nman who has come specially from Africa at my request and who has\r\ncarried out certain orders of mine. The \u2018Colonel\u2019 will have not\r\none of us to deal with, but two.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that wise?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is necessary.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are sure of this man?\u201d\r\n\r\nA rather peculiar smile played over the dancer\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am quite sure of him. He is inefficient, but perfectly\r\ntrustworthy.\u201d She paused, and then added in an indifferent tone of\r\nvoice: \u201cAs a matter of fact, he happens to be my husband.\u201d\r\n\nEverybody has been at me, right and left, to write this story from\r\nthe great (represented by Lord Nasby) to the small (represented by\r\nour late maid of all work, Emily, whom I saw when I was last in\r\nEngland. \u201cLor\u2019, miss, what a beyewtiful book you might make out of\r\nit all\u2014just like the pictures!\u201d).\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll admit that I\u2019ve certain qualifications for the task. I was\r\nmixed up in the affair from the very beginning, I was in the thick\r\nof it all through, and I was triumphantly \u201cin at the death.\u201d Very\r\nfortunately, too, the gaps that I cannot supply from my own\r\nknowledge are amply covered by Sir Eustace Pedler\u2019s diary, of which\r\nhe has kindly begged me to make use.\r\n\r\nSo here goes. Anne Beddingfeld starts to narrate her adventures.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d always longed for adventures. You see, my life had such a\r\ndreadful sameness. My father, Professor Beddingfeld, was one of\r\nEngland\u2019s greatest living authorities on Primitive Man. He really\r\nwas a genius\u2014every one admits that. His mind dwelt in Palaeolithic\r\ntimes, and the inconvenience of life for him was that his body\r\ninhabited the modern world. Papa did not care for modern man\u2014even\r\nNeolithic Man he despised as a mere herder of cattle, and he did\r\nnot rise to enthusiasm until he reached the Mousterian period.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately one cannot entirely dispense with modern men. One is\r\nforced to have some kind of truck with butchers and bakers and\r\nmilkmen and greengrocers. Therefore, Papa being immersed in the\r\npast, Mamma having died when I was a baby, it fell to me to\r\nundertake the practical side of living. Frankly, I hate Palaeolithic\r\nMan, be he Aurignacian, Mousterian, Chellian, or anything else,\r\nand though I typed and revised most of Papa\u2019s _Neanderthal Man and\r\nhis Ancestors,_ Neanderthal men themselves fill me with loathing,\r\nand I always reflect what a fortunate circumstance it was that they\r\nbecame extinct in remote ages.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether Papa guessed my feelings on the subject,\r\nprobably not, and in any case he would not have been interested.\r\nThe opinion of other people never interested him in the slightest\r\ndegree. I think it was really a sign of his greatness. In the same\r\nway, he lived quite detached from the necessities of daily life.\r\nHe ate what was put before him in an exemplary fashion, but seemed\r\nmildly pained when the question of paying for it arose. We never\r\nseemed to have any money. His celebrity was not of the kind that\r\nbrought in a cash return. Although he was a fellow of almost every\r\nimportant society, and had rows of letters after his name, the\r\ngeneral public scarcely knew of his existence, and his long learned\r\nbooks, though adding signally to the sum-total of human knowledge,\r\nhad no attraction for the masses. Only on one occasion did he leap\r\ninto the public gaze. He had read a paper before some society on\r\nthe subject of the young of the chimpanzee. The young of the human\r\nrace show some anthropoid features, whereas the young of the\r\nchimpanzee approach more nearly to the human than the adult\r\nchimpanzee does. That seems to show that whereas our ancestors were\r\nmore Simian than we are, the chimpanzee\u2019s were of a higher type\r\nthan the present species\u2014in other words, the chimpanzee is a\r\ndegenerate. That enterprising newspaper, the _Daily Budget,_ being\r\nhard up for something spicy, immediately brought itself out with\r\nlarge headlines. \u201cWe are not descended from monkeys, but are\r\nmonkeys descended from _us?_ Eminent Professor says chimpanzees\r\nare decadent humans.\u201d Shortly afterwards a reporter called to see\r\nPapa, and endeavoured to induce him to write a series of popular\r\narticles on the theory. I have seldom seen Papa so angry. He turned\r\nthe reporter out of the house with scant ceremony, much to my\r\nsecret sorrow, as we were particularly short of money at the\r\nmoment. In fact, for a moment I meditated running after the young\r\nman and informing him that my father had changed his mind and would\r\nsend the articles in question. I could easily have written them\r\nmyself, and the probabilities were that Papa would never have\r\nlearnt of the transaction, not being a reader of the _Daily Budget._\r\nHowever, I rejected this course as being too risky, so I merely\r\nput on my best hat and went sadly down the village to interview\r\nour justly irate grocer.\r\n\r\nThe reporter from the _Daily Budget_ was the only young man who\r\never came to our house. There were times when I envied Emily, our\r\nlittle servant, who \u201cwalked out\u201d whenever occasion offered with a\r\nlarge sailor to whom she was affianced. In between times, to \u201ckeep\r\nher hand in\u201d as she expressed it, she walked out with the\r\ngreengrocer\u2019s young man, and the chemist\u2019s assistant. I reflected\r\nsadly that I had no one to \u201ckeep my hand in\u201d with. All Papa\u2019s\r\nfriends were aged Professors\u2014usually with long beards. It is true\r\nthat Professor Peterson once clasped me affectionately and said I\r\nhad a \u201cneat little waist\u201d and then tried to kiss me. The phrase\r\nalone dated him hopelessly. No self-respecting female has had a\r\n\u201cneat little waist\u201d since I was in my cradle.\r\n\r\nI yearned for adventure, for love, for romance, and I seemed\r\ncondemned to an existence of drab utility. The village possessed\r\na lending library, full of tattered works of fiction, and I enjoyed\r\nperils and love-making at second hand, and went to sleep dreaming\r\nof stern, silent Rhodesians, and of strong men who always \u201cfelled\r\ntheir opponent with a single blow.\u201d There was no one in the village\r\nwho even looked as though he could \u201cfell\u201d an opponent, with a\r\nsingle blow or with several.\r\n\r\nThere was the Kinema too, with a weekly episode of \u201cThe Perils of\r\nPamela.\u201d Pamela was a magnificent young woman. Nothing daunted her.\r\nShe fell out of aeroplanes, adventured in submarines, climbed\r\nskyscrapers and crept about in the Underworld without turning a\r\nhair. She was not really clever, the Master Criminal of the\r\nUnderworld caught her each time, but as he seemed loath to knock\r\nher on the head in a simple way, and always doomed her to death in\r\na sewer-gas chamber or by some new and marvellous means, the hero\r\nwas always able to rescue her at the beginning of the following\r\nweek\u2019s episode. I used to come out with my head in a delirious\r\nwhirl\u2014and then I would get home and find a notice from the Gas\r\nCompany threatening to cut us off if the outstanding account was\r\nnot paid!\r\n\r\nAnd yet, though I did not suspect it, every moment was bringing\r\nadventure nearer to me.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that there are many people in the world who have\r\nnever heard of the finding of an antique skull at the Broken Hill\r\nMine in Northern Rhodesia. I came down one morning to find Papa\r\nexcited to the point of apoplexy. He poured out the whole story to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou understand, Anne? There are undoubtedly certain resemblances\r\nto the Java skull, but superficial\u2014superficial only. No, here we\r\nhave what I have always maintained\u2014the ancestral form of the\r\nNeanderthal race. You grant that the Gibraltar skull is the most\r\nprimitive of the Neanderthal skulls found? Why? The cradle of the\r\nrace was in Africa. They passed to Europe\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot marmalade on kippers, papa,\u201d I said hastily, arresting my\r\nparent\u2019s absent-minded hand. \u201cYes, you were saying?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey passed to Europe on\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nHere he broke down with a bad fit of choking, the result of an\r\nimmoderate mouthful of kipper-bones.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut we must start at once,\u201d he declared, as he rose to his feet\r\nat the conclusion of the meal. \u201cThere is no time to be lost. We\r\nmust be on the spot\u2014there are doubtless incalculable finds to be\r\nfound in the neighbourhood. I shall be interested to note whether\r\nthe implements are typical of the Mousterian period\u2014there will be\r\nthe remains of the primitive ox, I should say, but not those of\r\nthe woolly rhinoceros. Yes, a little army will be starting soon.\r\nWe must get ahead of them. You will write to Cook\u2019s to-day, Anne?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about money, papa?\u201d I hinted delicately.\r\n\r\nHe turned a reproachful eye upon me.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour point of view always depresses me, my child. We must not be\r\nsordid. No, no, in the cause of science one must not be sordid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI feel Cook\u2019s might be sordid, papa.\u201d\r\n\r\nPapa looked pained.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Anne, you will pay them in ready money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got any ready money.\u201d\r\n\r\nPapa looked thoroughly exasperated.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy child, I really cannot be bothered with these vulgar money\r\ndetails. The bank\u2014I had something from the Manager yesterday,\r\nsaying I had twenty-seven pounds.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s your overdraft, I fancy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, I have it! Write to my publishers.\u201d\r\n\r\nI acquiesced doubtfully, Papa\u2019s books bringing in more glory than\r\nmoney. I liked the idea of going to Rhodesia immensely. \u201cStern\r\nsilent men,\u201d I murmured to myself in an ecstasy. Then something in\r\nmy parent\u2019s appearance struck me as unusual.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have odd boots on, papa,\u201d I said. \u201cTake off the brown one and\r\nput on the other black one. And don\u2019t forget your muffler. It\u2019s a\r\nvery cold day.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Papa stalked off, correctly booted and well\r\nmufflered.\r\n\r\nHe returned late that evening, and, to my dismay, I saw his muffler\r\nand overcoat were missing.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me, Anne, you are quite right. I took them off to go into\r\nthe cavern. One gets so dirty there.\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded feelingly, remembering an occasion when Papa had returned\r\nliterally plastered from head to foot with rich Pleiocene clay.\r\n\r\nOur principal reason for settling in Little Hampsly had been the\r\nneighbourhood of Hampsly Cavern, a buried cave rich in deposits of\r\nthe Aurignacian culture. We had a tiny Museum in the village, and\r\nthe curator and Papa spent most of their days messing about\r\nunderground and bringing to light portions of woolly rhinoceros\r\nand cave bear.\r\n\r\nPapa coughed badly all the evening, and the following morning I\r\nsaw he had a temperature and sent for the doctor.\r\n\r\nPoor Papa, he never had a chance. It was double pneumonia. He died\r\nfour days later.\r\n\nEvery one was very kind to me. Dazed as I was, I appreciated that.\r\nI felt no overwhelming grief. Papa had never loved me, I knew that\r\nwell enough. If he had, I might have loved him in return. No, there\r\nhad not been love between us, but we had belonged together, and I\r\nhad looked after him, and had secretly admired his learning and\r\nhis uncompromising devotion to science. And it hurt me that Papa\r\nshould have died just when the interest of life was at its height\r\nfor him. I should have felt happier if I could have buried him in\r\na cave, with paintings of reindeer and flint implements, but the\r\nforce of public opinion constrained a neat tomb (with marble slab)\r\nin our hideous local churchyard. The vicar\u2019s consolations, though\r\nwell meant, did not console me in the least.\r\n\r\nIt took some time to dawn upon me that the thing I had always\r\nlonged for\u2014freedom\u2014was at last mine. I was an orphan, and\r\npractically penniless, but free. At the same time I realized the\r\nextraordinary kindness of all these good people. The vicar did his\r\nbest to persuade me that his wife was in urgent need of a companion\r\nhelp. Our tiny local library suddenly made up its mind to have an\r\nassistant librarian. Finally, the doctor called upon me, and after\r\nmaking various ridiculous excuses for failing to send in a proper\r\nbill, he hummed and hawed a good deal and suddenly suggested that\r\nI should marry him.\r\n\r\nI was very much astonished. The doctor was nearer forty than\r\nthirty, and a round, tubby little man. He was not at all like the\r\nhero of \u201cThe Perils of Pamela,\u201d and even less like a stern and\r\nsilent Rhodesian. I reflected a minute and then asked him why he\r\nwanted to marry me. That seemed to fluster him a good deal, and he\r\nmurmured that a wife was a great help to a General Practitioner.\r\nThe position seemed even more unromantic than before, and yet\r\nsomething in me urged towards its acceptance. Safety, that was what\r\nI was being offered. Safety\u2014and a Comfortable Home. Thinking it\r\nover now, I believe I did the little man an injustice. He was\r\nhonestly in love with me, but a mistaken delicacy prevented him\r\nfrom pressing his suit on those lines. Anyway, my love of romance\r\nrebelled.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely kind of you,\u201d I said. \u201cBut it\u2019s impossible. I could\r\nnever marry a man unless I loved him madly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think\u2014\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d I said firmly.\r\n\r\nHe sighed.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, my dear child, what do you propose to do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave adventures and see the world,\u201d I replied, without the least\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Anne, you are very much of a child still. You don\u2019t\r\nunderstand\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe practical difficulties? Yes, I do, doctor. I\u2019m not a\r\nsentimental schoolgirl\u2014I\u2019m a hard-headed mercenary shrew! You\u2019d\r\nknow it if you married me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish you would reconsider\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe sighed again.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have another proposal to make. An aunt of mine who lives in\r\nWales is in want of a young lady to help her. How would that suit\r\nyou?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, doctor, I\u2019m going to London. If things happen anywhere, they\r\nhappen in London. I shall keep my eyes open and you\u2019ll see,\r\nsomething will turn up! You\u2019ll hear of me next in China or\r\nTimbuctoo.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy next visitor was Mr. Flemming, Papa\u2019s London solicitor. He came\r\ndown specially from town to see me. An ardent anthropologist\r\nhimself, he was a great admirer of Papa\u2019s works. He was a tall,\r\nspare man with a thin face and grey hair. He rose to meet me as I\r\nentered the room and, taking both my hands in his, patted them\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy poor child,\u201d he said. \u201cMy poor, poor child.\u201d\r\n\r\nWithout conscious hypocrisy, I found myself assuming the demeanour\r\nof a bereaved orphan. He hypnotized me into it. He was benignant,\r\nkind and fatherly\u2014and without the least doubt he regarded me as a\r\nperfect fool of a girl left adrift to face an unkind world. From\r\nthe first I felt that it was quite useless to try to convince him\r\nof the contrary. As things turned out, perhaps it was just as well\r\nI didn\u2019t.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear child, do you think you can listen to me whilst I try to\r\nmake a few things clear to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour father, as you know, was a very great man. Posterity will\r\nappreciate him. But he was not a good man of business.\u201d\r\n\r\nI knew that quite as well, if not better than Mr. Flemming, but I\r\nrestrained myself from saying so. He continued:\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not suppose you understand much of these matters. I will try\r\nto explain as clearly as I can.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe explained at unnecessary length. The upshot seemed to be that\r\nI was left to face life with the sum of \u00a387, 17s. 4d. It seemed a\r\nstrangely unsatisfying amount. I waited in some trepidation for\r\nwhat was coming next. I feared that Mr. Flemming would be sure to\r\nhave an aunt in Scotland who was in want of a bright young\r\ncompanion. Apparently, however, he hadn\u2019t.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe question is,\u201d he went on, \u201cthe future. I understand you have\r\nno living relatives?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m alone in the world,\u201d I said, and was struck anew by my likeness\r\nto a film heroine.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have friends?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery one has been very kind to me,\u201d I said gratefully.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho would not be kind to one so young and charming?\u201d said Mr.\r\nFlemming gallantly. \u201cWell, well, my dear, we must see what can be\r\ndone.\u201d He hesitated a minute, and then said: \u201cSupposing\u2014how would\r\nit be if you came to us for a time?\u201d\r\n\r\nI jumped at the chance. London! The place for things to happen.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s awfully kind of you,\u201d I said. \u201cMight I really? Just while\r\nI\u2019m looking round. I must start out to earn my living, you know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes, my dear child. I quite understand. We will look round\r\nfor something\u2014suitable.\u201d\r\n\r\nI felt instinctively that Mr. Flemming\u2019s ideas of \u201csomething\r\nsuitable\u201d and mine were likely to be widely divergent, but it was\r\ncertainly not the moment to air my views.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is settled then. Why not return with me to-day?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, thank you, but will Mrs. Flemming\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy wife will be delighted to welcome you.\u201d\r\n\r\nI wonder if husbands know as much about their wives as they think\r\nthey do. If I had a husband, I should hate him to bring home\r\norphans without consulting me first.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will send her a wire from the station,\u201d continued the lawyer.\r\n\r\nMy few personal belongings were soon packed. I contemplated my hat\r\nsadly before putting it on. It had originally been what I call a\r\n\u201cMary\u201d hat, meaning by that the kind of hat a housemaid ought to\r\nwear on her day out\u2014but doesn\u2019t! A limp thing of black straw with\r\na suitably depressed brim. With the inspiration of genius, I had\r\nkicked it once, punched it twice, dented in the crown and affixed\r\nto it a thing like a cubist\u2019s dream of a jazz carrot. The result\r\nhad been distinctly chic. The carrot I had already removed, of\r\ncourse, and now I proceeded to undo the rest of my handiwork. The\r\n\u201cMary\u201d hat resumed its former status with an additional battered\r\nappearance which made it even more depressing than formerly. I\r\nmight as well look as much like the popular conception of an orphan\r\nas possible. I was just a shade nervous of Mrs. Flemming\u2019s\r\nreception, but hoped my appearance might have a sufficiently\r\ndisarming effect.\r\n\r\nMr. Flemming was nervous too. I realized that as we went up the\r\nstairs of the tall house in a quiet Kensington Square. Mrs. Flemming\r\ngreeted me pleasantly enough. She was a stout, placid woman of the\r\n\u201cgood wife and mother\u201d type. She took me up to a spotless\r\nchintz-hung bedroom, hoped I had everything I wanted, informed me\r\nthat tea would be ready in about a quarter of an hour, and left me\r\nto my own devices.\r\n\r\nI heard her voice, slightly raised, as she entered the drawing-room\r\nbelow on the first floor.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Henry, why on earth\u2014\u2014\u201d I lost the rest, but the acerbity of\r\nthe tone was evident. And a few minutes later another phrase\r\nfloated up to me, in an even more acid voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cI agree with you! She is certainly _very_ good-looking.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt is really a very hard life. Men will not be nice to you if you\r\nare not good-looking, and women will not be nice to you if you are.\r\n\r\nWith a deep sigh I proceeded to do things to my hair. I have nice\r\nhair. It is black\u2014a real black, not dark brown, and it grows well\r\nback from my forehead and down over the ears. With a ruthless hand\r\nI dragged it upwards. As ears, my ears are quite all right, but\r\nthere is no doubt about it, ears are _d\u00e9mod\u00e9_ nowadays. They are\r\nlike the \u201cQueen of Spain\u2019s legs\u201d in Professor Peterson\u2019s young day.\r\nWhen I had finished I looked almost unbelievably like the kind of\r\norphan that walks out in a queue with a little bonnet and a red\r\ncloak.\r\n\r\nI noticed when I went down that Mrs. Flemming\u2019s eyes rested on my\r\nexposed ears with quite a kindly glance. Mr. Flemming seemed\r\npuzzled. I had no doubt that he was saying to himself, \u201cWhat _has_\r\nthe child done to herself?\u201d\r\n\r\nOn the whole the rest of the day passed off well. It was settled\r\nthat I was to start at once to look for something to do.\r\n\r\nWhen I went to bed, I stared earnestly at my face in the glass.\r\nWas I really good-looking? Honestly, I couldn\u2019t say I thought so!\r\nI hadn\u2019t got a straight Grecian nose, or a rosebud mouth, or any\r\nof the things you ought to have. It is true that a curate once told\r\nme that my eyes were like \u201cimprisoned sunshine in a dark, dark\r\nwood\u201d\u2014but curates always know so many quotations, and fire them\r\noff at random. I\u2019d much prefer to have Irish blue eyes than dark\r\ngreen ones with yellow flecks! Still, green is a good colour for\r\nadventuresses.\r\n\r\nI wound a black garment tightly round me, leaving my arms and\r\nshoulders bare. Then I brushed back my hair and pulled it well down\r\nover my ears again. I put a lot of powder on my face, so that the\r\nskin seemed even whiter than usual. I fished about until I found\r\nsome old lip-salve, and I put oceans of it on my lips. Then I did\r\nunder my eyes with burnt cork. Finally, I draped a red ribbon over\r\nmy bare shoulder, stuck a scarlet feather in my hair, and placed\r\na cigarette in one corner of my mouth. The whole effect pleased me\r\nvery much.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnna the Adventuress,\u201d I said aloud, nodding at my reflection.\r\n\u201cAnna the Adventuress. Episode I, \u2018The House in Kensington\u2019!\u201d\r\n\r\nGirls are foolish things.\r\n\nIn the succeeding weeks I was a good deal bored.\r\n\r\nMrs. Flemming and her friends seemed to me to be supremely\r\nuninteresting. They talked for hours of themselves and their\r\nchildren and of the difficulties of getting good milk for the\r\nchildren and of what they said to the Dairy when the milk wasn\u2019t\r\ngood. Then they would go on to servants, and the difficulties of\r\ngetting good servants and of what they had said to the woman at\r\nthe Registry Office and of what the woman at the Registry Office\r\nhad said to them. They never seemed to read the papers or to care\r\nabout what went on in the world. They disliked travelling\u2014everything\r\nwas so different to England. The Riviera was all right, of course,\r\nbecause one met all one\u2019s friends there.\r\n\r\nI listened and contained myself with difficulty. Most of these\r\nwomen were rich. The whole wide beautiful world was theirs to\r\nwander in and they deliberately stayed in dirty dull London and\r\ntalked about milkmen and servants! I think now, looking back, that\r\nI was perhaps a shade intolerant. But they _were_ stupid\u2014stupid\r\neven at their chosen job: most of them kept the most extraordinarily\r\ninadequate and muddled housekeeping accounts.\r\n\r\nMy affairs did not progress very fast. The house and furniture had\r\nbeen sold, and the amount realized had just covered our debts. As\r\nyet, I had not been successful in finding a post. Not that I really\r\nwanted one! I had the firm conviction that, if I went about looking\r\nfor adventure, adventure would meet me halfway. It is a theory of\r\nmine that one always gets what one wants. My theory was about to\r\nbe proved in practice.\r\n\r\nIt was early in January\u2014the 8th, to be exact. I was returning from\r\nan unsuccessful interview with a lady who said she wanted a\r\nsecretary-companion, but really seemed to require a strong charwoman\r\nwho would work twelve hours a day for \u00a325 a year. Having parted\r\nwith mutual veiled impolitenesses, I walked down Edgware Road (the\r\ninterview had taken place in a house in St. John\u2019s Wood) and across\r\nHyde Park to St. George\u2019s Hospital. There I entered Hyde Park\r\nCorner Tube Station and took a ticket to Gloucester Road.\r\n\r\nOnce on the platform I walked to the extreme end of it. My inquiring\r\nmind wished to satisfy itself as to whether there really _were_\r\npoints and an opening between the two tunnels just beyond the\r\nstation in the direction of Down Street. I was foolishly pleased\r\nto find I was right. There were not many people on the platform,\r\nand at the extreme end there was only myself and one man. As I\r\npassed him, I sniffed dubiously. If there is one smell I cannot\r\nbear it is that of moth balls! This man\u2019s heavy overcoat simply\r\nreeked of them. And yet most men begin to wear their winter\r\novercoats before January, and consequently by this time the smell\r\nought to have worn off. The man was beyond me, standing close to\r\nthe edge of the tunnel. He seemed lost in thought, and I was able\r\nto stare at him without rudeness. He was a small thin man, very\r\nbrown of face, with light blue eyes and a small dark beard.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust come from abroad,\u201d I deduced. \u201cThat\u2019s why his overcoat smells\r\nso. He\u2019s come from India. Not an officer, or he wouldn\u2019t have a\r\nbeard. Perhaps a tea-planter.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this moment the man turned as though to retrace his steps along\r\nthe platform. He glanced at me and then his eyes went on to\r\nsomething behind me, and his face changed. It was distorted by\r\nfear\u2014almost panic. He stood a step backwards as though involuntarily\r\nrecoiling from some danger, forgetting that he was standing on the\r\nextreme edge of the platform, and went down and over.\r\n\r\nThere was a vivid flash from the rails and a crackling sound. I\r\nshrieked. People came running up. Two station officials seemed to\r\nmaterialize from nowhere and took command.\r\n\r\nI remained where I was, rooted to the spot by a sort of horrible\r\nfascination. Part of me was appalled at the sudden disaster, and\r\nanother part of me was coolly and dispassionately interested in\r\nthe methods employed for lifting the man off the live rail and back\r\nonto the platform.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me pass, please. I am a medical man.\u201d\r\n\r\nA tall man with a brown beard pressed past me and bent over the\r\nmotionless body.\r\n\r\nAs he examined it, a curious sense of unreality seemed to possess\r\nme. The thing wasn\u2019t real\u2014couldn\u2019t be. Finally, the doctor stood\r\nupright and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cDead as a door-nail. Nothing to be done.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had all crowded nearer, and an aggrieved porter raised his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow then, stand back there, will you? What\u2019s the sense in crowding\r\nround.\u201d\r\n\r\nA sudden nausea seized me, and I turned blindly and ran up the\r\nstairs again towards the lift. I felt that it was too horrible. I\r\nmust get out into the open air. The doctor who had examined the\r\nbody was just ahead of me. The lift was just about to go up,\r\nanother having descended, and he broke into a run. As he did so,\r\nhe dropped a piece of paper.\r\n\r\nI stopped, picked it up, and ran after him. But the lift gates\r\nclanged in my face, and I was left holding the paper in my hand.\r\nBy the time the second lift reached the street level, there was no\r\nsign of my quarry. I hoped it was nothing important that he had\r\nlost, and for the first time I examined it.\r\n\r\nIt was a plain half-sheet of notepaper with some figures and words\r\nscrawled upon it in pencil. This is a facsimile of it:\r\n\r\n[Indistinct cursive script which appears to say something like:\r\n \"1 7 . 1 2 2 Kilmorden Castle\"]\r\n\r\nOn the face of it, it certainly did not appear to be of any\r\nimportance. Still, I hesitated to throw it away. As I stood there\r\nholding it, I involuntarily wrinkled my nose in displeasure. Moth\r\nballs again! I held the paper gingerly to my nose. Yes, it smelt\r\nstrongly of them. But, then\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\nI folded up the paper carefully and put it in my bag. I walked home\r\nslowly and did a good deal of thinking.\r\n\r\nI explained to Mrs. Flemming that I had witnessed a nasty accident\r\nin the Tube and that I was rather upset and would go to my room\r\nand lie down. The kind woman insisted on my having a cup of tea.\r\nAfter that I was left to my own devices, and I proceeded to carry\r\nout a plan I had formed coming home. I wanted to know what it was\r\nthat had produced that curious feeling of unreality whilst I was\r\nwatching the doctor examine the body. First I lay down on the floor\r\nin the attitude of the corpse, then I laid a bolster down in my\r\nstead, and proceeded to duplicate, so far as I could remember,\r\nevery motion and gesture of the doctor. When I had finished I had\r\ngot what I wanted. I sat back on my heels and frowned at the\r\nopposite walls.\r\n\r\nThere was a brief notice in the evening papers that a man had been\r\nkilled in the Tube, and a doubt was expressed whether it was\r\nsuicide or accident. That seemed to me to make my duty clear, and\r\nwhen Mr. Flemming heard my story he quite agreed with me.\r\n\r\n\u201cUndoubtedly you will be wanted at the inquest. You say no one else\r\nwas near enough to see what happened?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI had the feeling some one was coming up behind me, but I can\u2019t\r\nbe sure\u2014and, anyway, they wouldn\u2019t be as near as I was.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe inquest was held. Mr. Flemming made all the arrangements and\r\ntook me there with him. He seemed to fear that it would be a great\r\nordeal to me, and I had to conceal from him my complete composure.\r\n\r\nThe deceased had been identified as L. B. Carton. Nothing had been\r\nfound in his pockets except a house-agent\u2019s order to view a house\r\non the river near Marlow. It was in the name of L. B. Carton,\r\nRussell Hotel. The bureau clerk from the hotel identified the man\r\nas having arrived the day before and booked a room under that name.\r\nHe had registered as L. B. Carton, Kimberley, S. Africa. He had\r\nevidently come straight off the steamer.\r\n\r\nI was the only person who had seen anything of the affair.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think it was an accident?\u201d the coroner asked me.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am positive of it. Something alarmed him, and he stepped\r\nbackwards blindly without thinking what he was doing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what could have alarmed him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat I don\u2019t know. But there was something. He looked\r\npanic-stricken.\u201d\r\n\r\nA stolid juryman suggested that some men were terrified of cats.\r\nThe man might have seen a cat. I didn\u2019t think his suggestion a very\r\nbrilliant one, but it seemed to pass muster with the jury, who were\r\nobviously impatient to get home and only too pleased at being able\r\nto give a verdict of accident as opposed to suicide.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is extraordinary to me,\u201d said the coroner, \u201cthat the doctor\r\nwho first examined the body has not come forward. His name and\r\naddress should have been taken at the time. It was most irregular\r\nnot to do so.\u201d\r\n\r\nI smiled to myself. I had my own theory in regard to the doctor.\r\nIn pursuance of it, I determined to make a call upon Scotland Yard\r\nat an early date.\r\n\r\nBut the next morning brought a surprise. The Flemmings took in the\r\n_Daily Budget,_ and the _Daily Budget_ was having a day after its\r\nown heart.\r\n\r\nEXTRAORDINARY SEQUEL TO TUBE ACCIDENT.\r\n\r\nWOMAN FOUND STABBED IN LONELY HOUSE.\r\n\r\nI read eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cA sensational discovery was made yesterday at the Mill House,\r\nMarlow. The Mill House, which is the property of Sir Eustace\r\nPedler, M.P., is to be let unfurnished, and an order to view this\r\nproperty was found in the pocket of the man who was at first\r\nthought to have committed suicide by throwing himself on the live\r\nrail at Hyde Park Corner Tube Station. In an upper room of the Mill\r\nHouse the body of a beautiful young woman was discovered yesterday,\r\nstrangled. She is thought to be a foreigner, but so far has not\r\nbeen identified. The police are reported to have a clue. Sir\r\nEustace Pedler, the owner of the Mill House, is wintering on the\r\nRiviera.\u201d\r\n\nNobody came forward to identify the dead woman. The inquest elicited\r\nthe following facts.\r\n\r\nShortly after one o\u2019clock on January 8th, a well-dressed woman with\r\na slight foreign accent had entered the offices of Messrs. Butler\r\nand Park, house-agents, in Knightsbridge. She explained that she\r\nwanted to rent or purchase a house on the Thames within easy reach\r\nof London. The particulars of several were given to her, including\r\nthose of the Mill House. She gave the name of Mrs. de Castina and\r\nher address as the Ritz, but there proved to be no one of that name\r\nstaying there, and the hotel people failed to identify the body.\r\n\r\nMrs. James, the wife of Sir Eustace Pedler\u2019s gardener, who acted\r\nas caretaker to the Mill House and inhabited the small lodge\r\nopening on the main road, gave evidence. About three o\u2019clock that\r\nafternoon, a lady came to see over the house. She produced an order\r\nfrom the house-agents, and, as was the usual custom, Mrs. James\r\ngave her the keys of the house. It was situated at some distance\r\nfrom the lodge, and she was not in the habit of accompanying\r\nprospective tenants. A few minutes later a young man arrived. Mrs.\r\nJames described him as tall and broad-shouldered, with a bronzed\r\nface and light grey eyes. He was clean-shaven and was wearing a\r\nbrown suit. He explained to Mrs. James that he was a friend of the\r\nlady who had come to look over the house, but had stopped at the\r\npost office to send a telegram. She directed him to the house, and\r\nthought no more about the matter.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later he reappeared, handed her back the keys and\r\nexplained that he feared the house would not suit them. Mrs. James\r\ndid not see the lady, but thought that she had gone on ahead. What\r\nshe did notice was that the young man seemed very much upset about\r\nsomething. \u201cHe looked like a man who\u2019d seen a ghost. I thought he\r\nwas taken ill.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn the following day another lady and gentleman came to see the\r\nproperty and discovered the body lying on the floor in one of the\r\nupstairs rooms. Mrs. James identified it as that of the lady who\r\nhad come the day before. The house-agents also recognized it as\r\nthat of \u201cMrs. de Castina.\u201d The police surgeon gave it as his\r\nopinion that the woman had been dead about twenty-four hours. The\r\n_Daily Budget_ had jumped to the conclusion that the man in the\r\nTube had murdered the woman and afterwards committed suicide.\r\nHowever, as the Tube victim was dead at two o\u2019clock, and the woman\r\nwas alive and well at three o\u2019clock, the only logical conclusion\r\nto come to was that the two occurrences had nothing to do with each\r\nother, and that the order to view the house at Marlow found in the\r\ndead man\u2019s pocket was merely one of those coincidences which so\r\noften occur in this life.\r\n\r\nA verdict of \u201cWilful Murder against some person or persons unknown\u201d\r\nwas returned, and the police (and the _Daily Budget_) were left to\r\nlook for \u201cthe man in the brown suit.\u201d Since Mrs. James was positive\r\nthat there was no one in the house when the lady entered it, and\r\nthat nobody except the young man in question entered it until the\r\nfollowing afternoon, it seemed only logical to conclude that he\r\nwas the murderer of the unfortunate Mrs. de Castina. She had been\r\nstrangled with a piece of stout black cord, and had evidently been\r\ncaught unawares with no time to cry out. The black silk handbag\r\nwhich she carried contained a well-filled notecase and some loose\r\nchange, a fine lace handkerchief, unmarked, and the return half of\r\na first-class ticket to London. Nothing much there to go upon.\r\n\r\nSuch were the details published broadcast by the _Daily Budget,_\r\nand \u201cFind the Man in the Brown Suit\u201d was their daily war-cry. On\r\nan average about five hundred people wrote daily to announce their\r\nsuccess in the quest, and tall young men with well-tanned faces\r\ncursed the day when their tailors had persuaded them to a brown\r\nsuit. The accident in the Tube, dismissed as a coincidence, faded\r\nout of the public mind.\r\n\r\nWas it a coincidence? I was not so sure. No doubt I was\r\nprejudiced\u2014the Tube incident was my own pet mystery\u2014but there\r\ncertainly seemed to me to be a connection of some kind between the\r\ntwo fatalities. In each there was a man with a tanned face\u2014evidently\r\nan Englishman living abroad, and there were other things. It was\r\nthe consideration of these other things that finally impelled me\r\nto what I considered a dashing step. I presented myself at Scotland\r\nYard and demanded to see whoever was in charge of the Mill House\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nMy request took some time to understand, as I had inadvertently\r\nselected the department for lost umbrellas, but eventually I was\r\nushered into a small room and presented to Detective Inspector\r\nMeadows.\r\n\r\nInspector Meadows was a small man with a ginger head and what I\r\nconsidered a peculiarly irritating manner. A satellite, also in\r\nplain clothes, sat unobtrusively in a corner.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d I said nervously.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood morning. Will you take a seat? I understand you\u2019ve something\r\nto tell me that you think may be of use to us.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis tone seemed to indicate that such a thing was unlikely in the\r\nextreme. I felt my temper stirred.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course you know about the man who was killed in the Tube? The\r\nman who had an order to view this same house at Marlow in his\r\npocket.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said the inspector. \u201cYou are the Miss Beddingfeld who gave\r\nevidence at the inquest. Certainly the man had an order in his\r\npocket. A lot of other people may have had too\u2014only they didn\u2019t\r\nhappen to be killed.\u201d\r\n\r\nI rallied my forces.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think it odd that this man had no ticket in his pocket?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEasiest thing in the world to drop your ticket. Done it myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd no money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe had some loose change in his trousers pocket.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut no notecase.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome men don\u2019t carry a pocket-book or notecase of any kind.\u201d\r\n\r\nI tried another tack.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s odd that the doctor never came forward\r\nafterwards?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA busy medical man very often doesn\u2019t read the papers. He probably\r\nforgot all about the accident.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn fact, inspector, you are determined to find nothing odd,\u201d I\r\nsaid sweetly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m inclined to think you\u2019re a little too fond of the word,\r\nMiss Beddingfeld. Young ladies are romantic, I know\u2014fond of\r\nmysteries and such-like. But as I\u2019m a busy man\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nI took the hint and rose.\r\n\r\nThe man in the corner raised a meek voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps the young lady would tell us briefly what her ideas really\r\nare on the subject, inspector?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe inspector fell in with the suggestion readily enough.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, come now, Miss Beddingfeld, don\u2019t be offended. You\u2019ve asked\r\nquestions and hinted things. Just say straight out what it is\r\nyou\u2019ve got in your head.\u201d\r\n\r\nI wavered between injured dignity and the overwhelming desire to\r\nexpress my theories. Injured dignity went to the wall.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou said at the inquest you were positive it wasn\u2019t suicide?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m quite certain of that. The man was frightened. What\r\nfrightened him? It wasn\u2019t me. But some one might have been walking\r\nup the platform towards us\u2014some one he recognized.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t see any one?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI didn\u2019t turn my head. Then, as soon as the body\r\nwas recovered from the line, a man pushed forward to examine it,\r\nsaying he was a doctor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing unusual in that,\u201d said the inspector dryly.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut he wasn\u2019t a doctor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t a doctor,\u201d I repeated.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you know that, Miss Beddingfeld?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say, exactly. I\u2019ve worked in Hospital during\r\nthe war, and I\u2019ve seen doctors handle bodies. There\u2019s a sort of\r\ndeft professional callousness that this man hadn\u2019t got. Besides,\r\na doctor doesn\u2019t usually feel for the heart on the right side of\r\nthe body.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe did that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I didn\u2019t notice it specially at the time\u2014except that I felt\r\nthere was something wrong. But I worked it out when I got home,\r\nand then I saw why the whole thing had looked so unhandy to me at\r\nthe time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cH\u2019m,\u201d said the inspector. He was reaching slowly for pen and\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn running his hands over the upper part of the man\u2019s body he\r\nwould have ample opportunity to take anything he wanted from the\r\npockets.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound likely to me,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cBut\u2014well, can\r\nyou describe him at all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was tall and broad-shouldered, wore a dark overcoat and black\r\nboots, a bowler hat. He had a dark pointed beard and gold-rimmed\r\neyeglasses.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTake away the overcoat, the beard and the eyeglasses, and there\r\nwouldn\u2019t be much to know him by,\u201d grumbled the inspector. \u201cHe could\r\nalter his appearance easy enough in five minutes if he wanted\r\nto\u2014which he would do if he\u2019s the swell pickpocket you suggest.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had not intended to suggest anything of the kind. But from this\r\nmoment I gave the inspector up as hopeless.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing more you can tell us about him?\u201d he demanded, as I rose\r\nto depart.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said. I seized my opportunity to fire a parting shot. \u201cHis\r\nhead was markedly brachycephalic. He will not find it so easy to\r\nalter that.\u201d\r\n\r\nI observed with pleasure that Inspector Meadow\u2019s pen wavered. It\r\nwas clear that he did not know how to spell brachycephalic.\r\n\nIn the first heat of indignation I found my next step unexpectedly\r\neasy to tackle. I had had a half-formed plan in my head when I went\r\ninto Scotland Yard. One to be carried out if my interview there\r\nwas unsatisfactory (it had been profoundly unsatisfactory). That\r\nis, if I had the nerve to go through with it.\r\n\r\nThings that one would shrink from attempting normally are easily\r\ntackled in a flush of anger. Without giving myself time to reflect,\r\nI walked straight to the house of Lord Nasby.\r\n\r\nLord Nasby was the millionaire owner of the _Daily Budget._ He\r\nowned other papers\u2014several of them, but the _Daily Budget_ was his\r\nspecial child. It was as the owner of the _Daily Budget_ that he\r\nwas known to every householder in the United Kingdom. Owing to the\r\nfact that an itinerary of the great man\u2019s daily proceedings had\r\njust been published, I knew exactly where to find him at this\r\nmoment. It was his hour for dictating to his secretary in his own\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nI did not, of course, suppose that any young woman who chose to\r\ncome and ask for him would be at once admitted to the august\r\npresence. But I had attended to that side of the matter. In the\r\ncard-tray in the hall of the Flemmings\u2019 house I had observed the\r\ncard of the Marquis of Loamsley, England\u2019s most famous sporting\r\npeer. I had removed the card, cleaned it carefully with bread-crumbs,\r\nand pencilled upon it the words: \u201cPlease give Miss Beddingfeld a\r\nfew moments of your time.\u201d Adventuresses must not be too scrupulous\r\nin their methods.\r\n\r\nThe thing worked. A powdered footman received the card and bore it\r\naway. Presently a pale secretary appeared. I fenced with him\r\nsuccessfully. He retired defeated. He again reappeared and begged\r\nme to follow him. I did so. I entered a large room, a\r\nfrightened-looking shorthand-typist fled past me like a visitant\r\nfrom the spirit-world. Then the door shut and I was face to face\r\nwith Lord Nasby.\r\n\r\nA big man. Big head. Big face. Big moustache. Big stomach. I pulled\r\nmyself together. I had not come here to comment on Lord Nasby\u2019s\r\nstomach. He was already roaring at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what is it? What does Loamsley want? You his secretary?\r\nWhat\u2019s it all about?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo begin with,\u201d I said with as great an appearance of coolness as\r\nI could manage, \u201cI don\u2019t know Lord Loamsley, and he certainly knows\r\nnothing about me. I took his card from the tray in the house of\r\nthe people I\u2019m staying with, and I wrote those words on it myself.\r\nIt was important that I should see you.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment it appeared to be a toss up as to whether Lord Nasby\r\nhad apoplexy or not. In the end, he swallowed twice and got over\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\u201cI admire your coolness, young woman. Well, you see me! If you\r\ninterest me, you will continue to see me for exactly two minutes\r\nlonger.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will be ample,\u201d I replied. \u201cAnd I shall interest you. It\u2019s\r\nthe Mill House Mystery.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve found \u2018The Man in the Brown Suit,\u2019 write to the Editor,\u201d\r\nhe interrupted hastily.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you will interrupt, I shall be more than two minutes,\u201d I said\r\nsternly. \u201cI haven\u2019t found \u2018The Man in the Brown Suit,\u2019 but I\u2019m\r\nquite likely to do so.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn as few words as possible I put the facts of the Tube accident\r\nand the conclusions I had drawn from them before him. When I had\r\nfinished he said unexpectedly:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you know of brachycephalic heads?\u201d\r\n\r\nI mentioned Papa.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Monkey man? Eh? Well, you seem to have a head of some kind\r\nupon your own shoulders, young woman. But it\u2019s all pretty thin,\r\nyou know. Not much to go upon. And no use to us\u2014as it stands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m perfectly aware of that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you want, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI want a job on your paper to investigate this matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t do that. We\u2019ve got our own special man on it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve got my own special knowledge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat you\u2019ve just told me, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, Lord Nasby. I\u2019ve still got something up my sleeve.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you have, have you? You seem a bright sort of girl. Well, what\r\nis it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen this so-called doctor got into the lift, he dropped a piece\r\nof paper. I picked it up. It smelt of moth balls. So did the dead\r\nman. The doctor didn\u2019t. So I saw at once that the doctor must have\r\ntaken it off the body. It had two words written on it and some\r\nfigures.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see it.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord Nasby stretched out a careless hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think not,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s my find, you see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m right. You _are_ a bright girl. Quite right to hang on to it.\r\nNo scruples about not handing it over to the police?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI went there to do so this morning. They persisted in regarding\r\nthe whole thing as having nothing to do with the Marlow affair, so\r\nI thought that in the circumstances I was justified in retaining\r\nthe paper. Besides, the inspector put my back up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShort-sighted man. Well, my dear girl, here\u2019s all I can do for\r\nyou. Go on working on this line of yours. If you get\r\nanything\u2014anything that\u2019s publishable\u2014send it along and you shall\r\nhave your chance. There\u2019s always room for real talent on the\r\n_Daily Budget._ But you\u2019ve got to make good first. See?\u201d\r\n\r\nI thanked him, and apologized for my methods.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. I rather like cheek\u2014from a pretty girl. By the\r\nway, you said two minutes and you\u2019ve been three, allowing for\r\ninterruptions. For a woman, that\u2019s quite remarkable! Must be your\r\nscientific training.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was in the street again, breathing hard as though I had been\r\nrunning. I found Lord Nasby rather wearing as a new acquaintance.\r\n\nI went home with a feeling of exultation. My scheme had succeeded\r\nfar better than I could possibly have hoped. Lord Nasby had been\r\npositively genial. It only now remained for me to \u201cMake good,\u201d as\r\nhe expressed it. Once locked in my own room, I took out my precious\r\npiece of paper and studied it attentively. Here was the clue to\r\nthe mystery.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, what did the figures represent? There were five of\r\nthem, and a dot after the first two. \u201cSeventeen\u2014one hundred and\r\ntwenty-two,\u201d I murmured.\r\n\r\nThat did not seem to lead to anything.\r\n\r\nNext I added them up. That is often done in works of fiction and\r\nleads to surprising deductions.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne and seven make eight and one is nine and two are eleven and\r\ntwo are thirteen.\u201d\r\n\r\nThirteen! Fateful number! Was this a warning to me to leave the\r\nwhole thing alone? Very possibly. Anyway, except as a warning, it\r\nseemed to be singularly useless. I declined to believe that any\r\nconspirator would take that way of writing thirteen in real life.\r\nIf he meant thirteen, he would write thirteen. \u201c13\u201d\u2014like that.\r\n\r\nThere was a space between the one and the two. I accordingly\r\nsubtracted twenty-two from a hundred and seventy-one. The result\r\nwas a hundred and fifty-nine. I did it again and made it a hundred\r\nand forty-nine. These arithmetical exercises were doubtless\r\nexcellent practice, but as regarded the solution of the mystery,\r\nthey seemed totally ineffectual. I left arithmetic alone, not\r\nattempting fancy division or multiplication, and went on to the\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nKilmorden Castle. That was something definite. A place. Probably\r\nthe cradle of an aristocratic family. (Missing heir? Claimant to\r\ntitle?) Or possibly a picturesque ruin. (Buried treasure?)\r\n\r\nYes, on the whole I inclined to the theory of buried treasure.\r\nFigures always go with buried treasure. One pace to the right,\r\nseven paces to the left, dig one foot, descend twenty-two steps.\r\nThat sort of idea. I could work out that later. The thing was to\r\nget to Kilmorden Castle as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nI made a strategic sally from my room and returned laden with books\r\nof reference. _Who\u2019s Who_, Whitaker, a Gazetteer, a History of\r\nScotch Ancestral Homes, and Somebody or other\u2019s British Isles.\r\n\r\nTime passed. I searched diligently, but with growing annoyance.\r\nFinally, I shut the last book with a bang. There appeared to be no\r\nsuch place as Kilmorden Castle. Here was an unexpected check. There\r\n_must_ be such a place. Why should any one invent a name like that\r\nand write it down on a piece of paper? Absurd!\r\n\r\nAnother idea occurred to me. Possibly it was a castellated\r\nabomination in the suburbs with a high-sounding name invented by\r\nits owner. But if so, it was going to be extraordinarily hard to\r\nfind. I sat back gloomily on my heels (I always sit on the floor\r\nto do anything really important) and wondered how on earth I was\r\nto set about it.\r\n\r\nWas there any other line I could follow? I reflected earnestly and\r\nthen sprang to my feet delightedly. Of course! I must visit the\r\n\u201cscene of the crime.\u201d Always done by the best sleuths! And no\r\nmatter how long afterwards it may be, they always find something\r\nthat the police have overlooked. My course was clear. I must go to\r\nMarlow.\r\n\r\nBut how was I to get into the house? I discarded several adventurous\r\nmethods, and plumped for stern simplicity. The house had been to\r\nlet\u2014presumably was still to let. I would be a prospective tenant.\r\n\r\nI also decided on attacking the local house-agents, as having fewer\r\nhouses on their books.\r\n\r\nHere, however, I reckoned without my host. A pleasant clerk produced\r\nparticulars of about half a dozen desirable properties. It took\r\nall my ingenuity to find objections to them. In the end I feared\r\nI had drawn a blank.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ve really nothing else?\u201d I asked, gazing pathetically into\r\nthe clerk\u2019s eyes. \u201cSomething right on the river, and with a fair\r\namount of garden and a small lodge,\u201d I added, summing up the main\r\npoints of the Mill House, as I had gathered them from the papers.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, of course there\u2019s Sir Eustace Pedler\u2019s place,\u201d said the man\r\ndoubtfully. \u201cThe Mill House, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot\u2014not where\u2014\u2014\u201d I faltered. (Really, faltering is getting to be\r\nmy strong point.)\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it! Where the murder took place. But perhaps you wouldn\u2019t\r\nlike\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think I should mind,\u201d I said with an appearance of\r\nrallying. I felt my _bona fides_ was now quite established. \u201cAnd\r\nperhaps I might get it cheap\u2014in the circumstances.\u201d\r\n\r\nA master touch that, I thought.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s possible. There\u2019s no pretending that it will be easy\r\nto let now\u2014servants and all that, you know. If you like the place\r\nafter you\u2019ve seen it, I should advise you to make an offer. Shall\r\nI write you out an order?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you please.\u201d\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later I was at the lodge of the Mill House.\r\nIn answer to my knock, the door flew open and a tall middle-aged\r\nwoman literally bounced out.\r\n\r\n\u201cNobody can go into the house, do you hear that? Fairly sick of\r\nyou reporters, I am. Sir Eustace\u2019s orders are\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI understood the house was to let,\u201d I said freezingly, holding\r\nout my order. \u201cOf course, if it\u2019s already taken\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure I beg your pardon, miss. I\u2019ve been fairly pestered\r\nwith these newspaper people. Not a minute\u2019s peace. No, the house\r\nisn\u2019t let\u2014nor likely to be now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre the drains wrong?\u201d I asked in an anxious whisper.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Lord, miss, the _drains_ is all right! But surely you\u2019ve heard\r\nabout that foreign lady as was done to death here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe I did read something about it in the papers,\u201d I said\r\ncarelessly.\r\n\r\nMy indifference piqued the good woman. If I had betrayed any\r\ninterest, she would probably have closed up like an oyster. As it\r\nwas, she positively bridled.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should say you did, miss! It\u2019s been in all the newspapers. The\r\n_Daily Budget\u2019s_ out still to catch the man who did it. It seems,\r\naccording to them, as our police are no good at all. Well, I hope\r\nthey\u2019ll get him\u2014although a nice-looking young fellow he was and no\r\nmistake. A kind of soldierly look about him\u2014ah, well, I dare say\r\nhe\u2019d been wounded in the war, and sometimes they go a bit queer\r\nafterwards, my sister\u2019s boy did. Perhaps she\u2019d used him bad\u2014they\u2019re\r\na bad lot, those foreigners. Though she was a fine-looking woman.\r\nStood there where you\u2019re standing now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas she dark or fair?\u201d I ventured. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell from these\r\nnewspaper portraits.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDark hair, and a very white face\u2014too white for nature, I thought,\r\nand her lips reddened something cruel. I don\u2019t like to see it\u2014a\r\nlittle powder now and then is quite another thing.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe were conversing like old friends now. I put another question.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid she seem nervous or upset at all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit. She was smiling to herself, quiet like, as though she\r\nwas amused at something. That\u2019s why you could have knocked me down\r\nwith a feather when, the next afternoon, those people came running\r\nout calling for the police and saying there\u2019d been murder done. I\r\nshall never get over it, and as for setting foot in that house\r\nafter dark I wouldn\u2019t do it, not if it was ever so. Why, I wouldn\u2019t\r\neven stay here at the lodge, if Sir Eustace hadn\u2019t been down on\r\nhis bended knees to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought Sir Eustace Pedler was at Cannes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo he was, miss. He come back to England when he heard the news,\r\nand, as to the bended knees, that was a figure of speech, his\r\nsecretary, Mr. Pagett, having offered us double pay to stay on,\r\nand, as my John says, money is money nowadays.\u201d\r\n\r\nI concurred heartily with John\u2019s by no means original remarks.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe young man now,\u201d said Mrs. James, reverting suddenly to a\r\nformer point in the conversation. \u201cHe was upset. His eyes, light\r\neyes, they were, I noticed them particular, was all shining.\r\nExcited, _I_ thought. But I never dreamt of anything being wrong.\r\nNot even when he came out again looking all queer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long was he in the house?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, not long, a matter of five minutes maybe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow tall was he, do you think? About six foot?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should say so maybe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was clean-shaven, you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, miss\u2014not even one of these toothbrush moustaches.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas his chin at all shiny?\u201d I asked on a sudden impulse.\r\n\r\nMrs. James stared at me with awe.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, now you come to mention it, miss, it _was._ However did you\r\nknow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a curious thing, but murderers often have shiny chins,\u201d I\r\nexplained wildly.\r\n\r\nMrs. James accepted the statement in all good faith.\r\n\r\n\u201cReally, now, miss. I never heard that before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t notice what kind of a head he had, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust the ordinary kind, miss. I\u2019ll fetch you the keys, shall I?\u201d\r\n\r\nI accepted them, and went on my way to the Mill House. My\r\nreconstructions so far I considered good. All along I had realized\r\nthat the differences between the man Mrs. James had described and\r\nmy Tube \u201cdoctor\u201d were those of non-essentials. An overcoat, a\r\nbeard, gold-rimmed eyeglasses. The \u201cdoctor\u201d had appeared middle-aged,\r\nbut I remembered that he had stooped over the body like a\r\ncomparatively young man. There had been a suppleness which told of\r\nyoung joints.\r\n\r\nThe victim of the accident (the Moth Ball man, as I called him to\r\nmyself) and the foreign woman, Mrs. de Castina, or whatever her\r\nreal name was, had had an assignation to meet at the Mill House.\r\nThat was how I pieced the thing together. Either because they\r\nfeared they were being watched or for some other reason, they chose\r\nthe rather ingenious method of both getting an order to view the\r\nsame house. Thus their meeting there might have the appearance of\r\npure chance.\r\n\r\nThat the Moth Ball man had suddenly caught sight of the \u201cdoctor,\u201d\r\nand that the meeting was totally unexpected and alarming to him,\r\nwas another fact of which I was fairly sure. What had happened\r\nnext? The \u201cdoctor\u201d had removed his disguise and followed the woman\r\nto Marlow. But it was possible that had he removed it rather\r\nhastily traces of spirit-gum might still linger on his chin. Hence\r\nmy question to Mrs. James.\r\n\r\nWhilst occupied with my thoughts I had arrived at the low\r\nold-fashioned door of the Mill House. Unlocking it with the key,\r\nI passed inside. The hall was low and dark, the place smelt forlorn\r\nand mildewy. In spite of myself, I shivered. Did the woman who had\r\ncome here \u201csmiling to herself\u201d a few days ago feel no chill of\r\npremonition as she entered this house? I wondered. Did the smile\r\nfade from her lips, and did a nameless dread close round her heart?\r\nOr had she gone upstairs, smiling still, unconscious of the doom\r\nthat was so soon to overtake her? My heart beat a little faster.\r\nWas the house really empty? Was doom waiting for me in it also?\r\nFor the first time, I understood the meaning of the much-used word,\r\n\u201catmosphere.\u201d There was an atmosphere in this house, an atmosphere\r\nof cruelty, of menace, of evil.\r\n\nShaking off the feelings that oppressed me, I went quickly upstairs.\r\nI had no difficulty in finding the room of the tragedy. On the day\r\nthe body was discovered it had rained heavily, and large muddy\r\nboots had trampled the uncarpeted floor in every direction. I\r\nwondered if the murderer had left any footmarks the previous day.\r\nIt was likely that the police would be reticent on the subject if\r\nhe had, but on consideration I decided it was unlikely. The weather\r\nhad been fine and dry.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing of interest about the room. It was almost square\r\nwith two big bay windows, plain white walls and a bare floor, the\r\nboards being stained round the edges where the carpet had ceased.\r\nI searched it carefully, but there was not so much as a pin lying\r\nabout. The gifted young detective did not seem likely to discover\r\na neglected clue.\r\n\r\nI had brought with me a pencil and notebook. There did not seem\r\nmuch to note, but I duly dotted down a brief sketch of the room to\r\ncover my disappointment at the failure of my quest. As I was in\r\nthe act of returning the pencil to my bag, it slipped from my\r\nfingers and rolled along the floor.\r\n\r\nThe Mill House was really old, and the floors were very uneven.\r\nThe pencil rolled steadily, with increasing momentum, until it came\r\nto rest under one of the windows. In the recess of each window\r\nthere was a broad window-seat, underneath which there was a\r\ncupboard. My pencil was lying right against the cupboard door. The\r\ncupboard was shut, but it suddenly occurred to me that if it had\r\nbeen open my pencil would have rolled inside. I opened the door,\r\nand my pencil immediately rolled in and sheltered modestly in the\r\nfarthest corner. I retrieved it, noting as I did so that owing to\r\nthe lack of light and the peculiar formation of the cupboard one\r\ncould not see it, but had to feel for it. Apart from my pencil the\r\ncupboard was empty, but being thorough by nature I tried the one\r\nunder the opposite window.\r\n\r\nAt first sight, it looked as though that also was empty, but I\r\ngrubbed about perseveringly, and was rewarded by feeling my hand\r\nclose on a hard paper cylinder which lay in a sort of trough, or\r\ndepression, in the far corner of the cupboard. As soon as I had it\r\nin my hand, I knew what it was. A roll of Kodak films. Here was a\r\nfind!\r\n\r\nI realized, of course, that these films might very well be an old\r\nroll belonging to Sir Eustace Pedler which had rolled in here and\r\nhad not been found when the cupboard was emptied. But I did not\r\nthink so. The red paper was far too fresh-looking. It was just as\r\ndusty as it would have been had it laid there for two or three\r\ndays\u2014that is to say, since the murder. Had it been there for any\r\nlength of time, it would have been thickly coated.\r\n\r\nWho had dropped it? The woman or the man? I remembered that the\r\ncontents of her handbag had appeared to be intact. If it had been\r\njerked open in the struggle and the roll of films had fallen out,\r\nsurely some of the loose money would have been scattered about\r\nalso? No, it was not the woman who had dropped the films.\r\n\r\nI sniffed suddenly and suspiciously. Was the smell of moth balls\r\nbecoming an obsession with me? I could swear that the roll of films\r\nsmelt of it also? I held them under my nose. They had, as usual,\r\na strong smell of their own, but apart from that I could clearly\r\ndetect the odour I disliked so much. I soon found the cause. A\r\nminute shred of cloth had caught on a rough edge of the centre\r\nwood, and that shred was strongly impregnated with moth balls. At\r\nsome time or another the films had been carried in the overcoat\r\npocket of the man who was killed in the Tube. Was it he who had\r\ndropped them here? Hardly. His movements were all accounted for.\r\n\r\nNo, it was the other man, the \u201cdoctor.\u201d He had taken the films when\r\nhe had taken the paper. It was he who had dropped them here during\r\nhis struggle with the woman.\r\n\r\nI had got my clue! I would have the roll developed, and then I\r\nwould have further developments to work upon.\r\n\r\nVery elated, I left the house, returned the keys to Mrs. James and\r\nmade my way as quickly as possible to the station. On the way back\r\nto town, I took out my paper and studied it afresh. Suddenly the\r\nfigures took on a new significance. Suppose they were a date? 17\r\n1 22. The 17th of January, 1922. Surely that must be it! Idiot that\r\nI was not to have thought of it before. But in that case I _must_\r\nfind out the whereabouts of Kilmorden Castle, for to-day was\r\nactually the 14th. Three days. Little enough\u2014almost hopeless when\r\none had no idea of where to look!\r\n\r\nIt was too late to hand in my roll to-day. I had to hurry home to\r\nKensington so as not to be late for dinner. It occurred to me that\r\nthere was an easy way of verifying whether some of my conclusions\r\nwere correct. I asked Mr. Flemming whether there had been a camera\r\namongst the dead man\u2019s belongings. I knew that he had taken an\r\ninterest in the case and was conversant with all the details.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise and annoyance he replied that there had been no\r\ncamera. All Carton\u2019s effects had been gone over very carefully in\r\nthe hopes of finding something that might throw light upon his\r\nstate of mind. He was positive that there had been no photographic\r\napparatus of any kind.\r\n\r\nThat was rather a set-back to my theory. If he had no camera, why\r\nshould he be carrying a roll of films?\r\n\r\nI set out early next morning to take my precious roll to be\r\ndeveloped. I was so fussy that I went all the way to Regent Street\r\nto the big Kodak place. I handed it in and asked for a print of\r\neach film. The man finished stacking together a heap of films\r\npacked in yellow tin cylinders for the tropics, and picked up my\r\nroll.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve made a mistake, I think,\u201d he said, smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m sure I haven\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve given me the wrong roll. This is an _unexposed_ one.\u201d\r\n\r\nI walked out with what dignity I could muster. I dare say it is\r\ngood for one now and again to realize what an idiot one can be!\r\nBut nobody relishes the process.\r\n\r\nAnd then, just as I was passing one of the big shipping offices,\r\nI came to a sudden halt. In the window was a beautiful model of\r\none of the company\u2019s boats, and it was labelled \u201cKenilworth Castle.\u201d\r\nA wild idea shot through my brain. I pushed the door open and went\r\nin. I went up to the counter and in faltering voice (genuine this\r\ntime!) I murmured:\r\n\r\n\u201cKilmorden Castle?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the 17th from Southampton. Cape Town? First or second class?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFirst class, eighty-seven pounds\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nI interrupted him. The coincidence was too much for me. Exactly\r\nthe amount of my legacy! I would put all my eggs in one basket.\r\n\r\n\u201cFirst class,\u201d I said.\r\n\n  _(Extracts from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an extraordinary thing that I never seem to get any peace.\r\nI am a man who likes a quiet life. I like my Club, my rubber of\r\nBridge, a well-cooked meal, a sound wine. I like England in the\r\nsummer, and the Riviera in the winter. I have no desire to\r\nparticipate in sensational happenings. Sometimes, in front of a\r\ngood fire, I do not object to reading about them in the newspaper.\r\nBut that is as far as I am willing to go. My object in life is to\r\nbe thoroughly comfortable. I have devoted a certain amount of\r\nthought, and a considerable amount of money, to further that end.\r\nBut I cannot say that I always succeed. If things do not actually\r\nhappen to me, they happen round me, and frequently, in spite of\r\nmyself, I become involved. I hate being involved.\r\n\r\nAll this because Guy Pagett came into my bedroom this morning with\r\na telegram in his hand and a face as long as a mute at a funeral.\r\n\r\nGuy Pagett is my secretary, a zealous, painstaking, hard-working\r\nfellow, admirable in every respect. I know no one who annoys me\r\nmore. For a long time I have been racking my brains as to how to\r\nget rid of him. But you cannot very well dismiss a secretary\r\nbecause he prefers work to play, likes getting up early in the\r\nmorning, and has positively no vices. The only amusing thing about\r\nthe fellow is his face. He has the face of a fourteenth-century\r\npoisoner\u2014the sort of man the Borgias got to do their odd jobs for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t mind so much if Pagett didn\u2019t make me work too. My idea\r\nof work is something that should be undertaken lightly and\r\nairily\u2014trifled with, in fact! I doubt if Guy Pagett has ever\r\ntrifled with anything in his life. He takes everything seriously.\r\nThat is what makes him so difficult to live with.\r\n\r\nLast week I had the brilliant idea of sending him off to Florence.\r\nHe talked about Florence and how much he wanted to go there.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d I cried, \u201cyou shall go to-morrow. I will pay all\r\nyour expenses.\u201d\r\n\r\nJanuary isn\u2019t the usual time for going to Florence, but it would\r\nbe all one to Pagett. I could imagine him going about, guide-book\r\nin hand, religiously doing all the picture galleries. And a week\u2019s\r\nfreedom was cheap to me at the price.\r\n\r\nIt has been a delightful week. I have done everything I wanted to,\r\nand nothing that I did not want to do. But when I blinked my eyes\r\nopen, and perceived Pagett standing between me and the light at\r\nthe unearthly hour of 9 a.m. this morning, I realized that freedom\r\nwas over.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d I said, \u201chas the funeral already taken place, or\r\nis it for later in the morning?\u201d\r\n\r\nPagett does not appreciate dry humour. He merely stared.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you know, Sir Eustace?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKnow what?\u201d I said crossly. \u201cFrom the expression of your face I\r\ninferred that one of your near and dear relatives was to be interred\r\nthis morning.\u201d\r\n\r\nPagett ignored the sally as far as possible.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you couldn\u2019t know about this.\u201d He tapped the telegram.\r\n\u201cI know you dislike being aroused early\u2014but it _is_ nine\r\no\u2019clock\u201d\u2014Pagett insists on regarding 9 a.m. as practically the\r\nmiddle of the day\u2014\u201cand I thought that under the circumstances\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\nHe tapped the telegram again.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is that thing?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a telegram from the police at Marlow. A woman has been\r\nmurdered in your house.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat aroused me in earnest.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat colossal cheek,\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cWhy in _my_ house? Who murdered\r\nher?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey don\u2019t say. I suppose we shall go back to England at once,\r\nSir Eustace?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou need suppose nothing of the kind. Why should we go back?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe police\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat on earth have I to do with the police?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it was your house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat,\u201d I said, \u201cappears to be more my misfortune than my fault.\u201d\r\n\r\nGuy Pagett shook his head gloomily.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will have a very unfortunate effect upon the constituency,\u201d he\r\nremarked lugubriously.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t see why it should have\u2014and yet I have a feeling that in\r\nsuch matters Pagett\u2019s instincts are always right. On the face of\r\nit, a Member of Parliament will be none the less efficient because\r\na stray young woman comes and gets herself murdered in an empty\r\nhouse that belongs to him\u2014but there is no accounting for the view\r\nthe respectable British public takes of a matter.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a foreigner too, and that makes it worse,\u201d continued Pagett\r\ngloomily.\r\n\r\nAgain I believe he is right. If it is disreputable to have a woman\r\nmurdered in your house, it becomes more disreputable if the woman\r\nis a foreigner. Another idea struck me.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens,\u201d I exclaimed, \u201cI hope this won\u2019t upset Caroline.\u201d\r\n\r\nCaroline is the lady who cooks for me. Incidentally she is the wife\r\nof my gardener. What kind of a wife she makes I do not know, but\r\nshe is an excellent cook. James, on the other hand, is not a good\r\ngardener\u2014but I support him in idleness and give him the lodge to\r\nlive in solely on account of Caroline\u2019s cooking.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose she\u2019ll stay after this,\u201d said Pagett.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou always were a cheerful fellow,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\nI expect I shall have to go back to England. Pagett clearly intends\r\nthat I shall. And there is Caroline to pacify.\r\n\r\n_Three days later._\r\n\r\nIt is incredible to me that any one who can get away from England\r\nin winter does not do so! It is an abominable climate. All this\r\ntrouble is very annoying. The house-agents say it will be next to\r\nimpossible to let the Mill House after all the publicity. Caroline\r\nhas been pacified\u2014with double pay. We could have sent her a cable\r\nto that effect from Cannes. In fact, as I have said all along,\r\nthere was no earthly purpose to serve by our coming over. I shall\r\ngo back to-morrow.\r\n\r\n_One day later._\r\n\r\nSeveral very surprising things have occurred. To begin with, I met\r\nAugustus Milray, the most perfect example of an old ass the present\r\nGovernment has produced. His manner oozed diplomatic secrecy as he\r\ndrew me aside in the Club into a quiet corner. He talked a good\r\ndeal. About South Africa and the industrial situation there. About\r\nthe growing rumours of a strike on the Rand. Of the secret causes\r\nactuating that strike. I listened as patiently as I could. Finally,\r\nhe dropped his voice to a whisper and explained that certain\r\ndocuments had come to light which ought to be placed in the hands\r\nof General Smuts.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve no doubt you\u2019re quite right,\u201d I said, stifling a yawn.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how are we to get them to him? Our position in the matter is\r\ndelicate\u2014very delicate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the post?\u201d I said cheerfully. \u201cPut a two-penny\r\nstamp on and drop \u2019em in the nearest letter-box.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe seemed quite shocked at the suggestion.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Pedler! The common post!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt has always been a mystery to me why Governments employ Kings\u2019\r\nMessengers and draw such attention to their confidential documents.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like the post, send one of your young Foreign Office\r\nfellows. He\u2019ll enjoy the trip.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cImpossible,\u201d said Milray, wagging his head in a senile fashion.\r\n\u201cThere are reasons, my dear Pedler\u2014I assure you there are reasons.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, rising, \u201call this is very interesting, but I must\r\nbe off\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne minute, my dear Pedler, one minute, I beg of you. Now tell\r\nme, in confidence, is it not true that you intend visiting South\r\nAfrica shortly yourself? You have large interests in Rhodesia, I\r\nknow, and the question of Rhodesia joining in the Union is one in\r\nwhich you have a vital interest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I had thought of going out in about a month\u2019s time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly make it sooner? This month? This week, in\r\nfact?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could,\u201d I said, eyeing him with some interest. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know\r\nthat I particularly want to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou would be doing the Government a great service\u2014a very great\r\nservice. You would not find them\u2014er\u2014ungrateful.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMeaning, you want me to be the postman?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. Your position is an unofficial one, your journey is _bona\r\nfide._ Everything would be eminently satisfactory.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said slowly, \u201cI don\u2019t mind if I do. The one thing I am\r\nanxious to do is to get out of England again as soon as possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will find the climate of South Africa delightful\u2014quite\r\ndelightful.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow, I know all about the climate. I was out there\r\nshortly before the war.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am really much obliged to you, Pedler. I will send you round\r\nthe package by messenger. To be placed in General Smuts\u2019s own\r\nhands, you understand? The _Kilmorden Castle_ sails on Saturday\u2014quite\r\na good boat.\u201d\r\n\r\nI accompanied him a short way along Pall Mall before we parted. He\r\nshook me warmly by the hand, and thanked me again effusively.\r\n\r\nI walked home reflecting on the curious by-ways of Governmental\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nIt was the following evening that Jarvis, my butler, informed me\r\nthat a gentleman wished to see me on private business, but declined\r\nto give his name. I have always a lively apprehension of insurance\r\ntouts, so told Jarvis to say I could not see him. Guy Pagett,\r\nunfortunately, when he might for once have been of real use, was\r\nlaid up with a bilious attack. These earnest, hard-working young\r\nmen with weak stomachs are always liable to bilious attacks.\r\n\r\nJarvis returned.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe gentleman asked me to tell you, Sir Eustace, that he comes to\r\nyou from Mr. Milray.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat altered the complexion of things. A few minutes later I was\r\nconfronting my visitor in the library. He was a well-built young\r\nfellow with a deeply tanned face. A scar ran diagonally from the\r\ncorner of his eye to the jaw, disfiguring what would otherwise have\r\nbeen a handsome though somewhat reckless countenance.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cwhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Milray sent me to you, Sir Eustace. I am to accompany you to\r\nSouth Africa as your secretary.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a secretary already. I don\u2019t\r\nwant another.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think you do, Sir Eustace. Where is your secretary now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s down with a bilious attack,\u201d I explained.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are sure it\u2019s only a bilious attack?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course it is. He\u2019s subject to them.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy visitor smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may or may not be a bilious attack. Time will show. But I can\r\ntell you this, Sir Eustace, Mr. Milray would not be surprised if\r\nan attempt were made to get your secretary out of the way. Oh, you\r\nneed have no fear for yourself\u201d\u2014I suppose a momentary alarm had\r\nflickered across my face\u2014\u201cyou are not threatened. Your secretary\r\nout of the way, access to you would be easier. In any case, Mr.\r\nMilray wishes me to accompany you. The passage-money will be our\r\naffair, of course, but you will take the necessary steps about the\r\npassport, as though you had decided that you needed the services\r\nof a second secretary.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe seemed a determined young man. We stared at each other and he\r\nstared me down.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d I said feebly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will say nothing to any one as to my accompanying you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d I said again.\r\n\r\nAfter all, perhaps it was better to have this fellow with me, but\r\nI had a premonition that I was getting into deep waters. Just when\r\nI thought I had attained peace!\r\n\r\nI stopped my visitor as he was turning to depart.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt might be just as well if I knew my new secretary\u2019s name,\u201d I\r\nobserved sarcastically.\r\n\r\nHe considered for a minute.\r\n\r\n\u201cHarry Rayburn seems quite a suitable name,\u201d he observed.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious way of putting it.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d I said for the third time.\r\n\n  _(Anne\u2019s Narrative Resumed)_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is most undignified for a heroine to be sea-sick. In books the\r\nmore it rolls and tosses, the better she likes it. When everybody\r\nelse is ill, she alone staggers along the deck, braving the elements\r\nand positively rejoicing in the storm. I regret to say that at the\r\nfirst roll the _Kilmorden_ gave, I turned pale and hastened below.\r\nA sympathetic stewardess received me. She suggested dry toast and\r\nginger ale.\r\n\r\nI remained groaning in my cabin for three days. Forgotten was my\r\nquest. I had no longer any interest in solving mysteries. I was a\r\ntotally different Anne to the one who had rushed back to the South\r\nKensington square so jubilantly from the shipping office.\r\n\r\nI smile now as I remember my abrupt entry into the drawing-room.\r\nMrs. Flemming was alone there. She turned her head as I entered.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that you, Anne, my dear? There is something I want to talk over\r\nwith you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d I said, curbing my impatience.\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Emery is leaving me.\u201d Miss Emery was the governness. \u201cAs you\r\nhave not yet succeeded in finding anything, I wondered if you would\r\ncare\u2014it would be so nice if you remained with us altogether?\u201d\r\n\r\nI was touched. She didn\u2019t want me, I knew. It was sheer Christian\r\ncharity that prompted the offer. I felt remorseful for my secret\r\ncriticism of her. Getting up, I ran impulsively across the room\r\nand flung my arms round her neck.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a dear,\u201d I said. \u201cA dear, a dear, a dear! And thank you\r\never so much. But it\u2019s all right, I\u2019m off to South Africa on\r\nSaturday.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy abrupt onslaught had startled the good lady. She was not used\r\nto sudden demonstrations of affection. My words startled her still\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo South Africa? My dear Anne. We would have to look into anything\r\nof that kind very carefully.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat was the last thing I wanted. I explained that I had already\r\ntaken my passage, and that upon arrival I proposed to take up the\r\nduties of a parlourmaid. It was the only thing I could think of on\r\nthe spur of the moment. There was, I said, a great demand for\r\nparlourmaids in South Africa. I assured her that I was equal to\r\ntaking care of myself, and in the end, with a sigh of relief at\r\ngetting me off her hands, she accepted the project without further\r\nquery. At parting, she slipped an envelope into my hand. Inside it\r\nI found five new crisp five-pound notes and the words: \u201cI hope you\r\nwill not be offended and will accept this with my love.\u201d She was\r\na very good, kind woman. I could not have continued to live in the\r\nsame house with her, but I did recognize her intrinsic worth.\r\n\r\nSo here I was, with twenty-five pounds in my pocket, facing the\r\nworld and pursuing my adventure.\r\n\r\nIt was on the fourth day that the stewardess finally urged me up\r\non deck. Under the impression that I should die quicker below, I\r\nhad steadfastly refused to leave my bunk. She now tempted me with\r\nthe advent of Madeira. Hope rose in my breast. I could leave the\r\nboat and go ashore and be a parlourmaid there. Anything for dry\r\nland.\r\n\r\nMuffled in coats and rugs, and weak as a kitten on my legs, I was\r\nhauled up and deposited, an inert mass, on a deck-chair. I lay\r\nthere with my eyes closed, hating life. The purser, a fair-haired\r\nyoung man, with a round boyish face, came and sat down beside me.\r\n\r\n\u201cHullo! Feeling rather sorry for yourself, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I replied, hating him.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, you won\u2019t know yourself in another day or two. We\u2019ve had\r\nrather a nasty dusting in the Bay, but there\u2019s smooth weather\r\nahead. I\u2019ll be taking you on at quoits to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not reply.\r\n\r\n\u201cThink you\u2019ll never recover, eh? But I\u2019ve seen people much worse\r\nthan you, and two days later they were the life and soul of the\r\nship. You\u2019ll be the same.\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not feel sufficiently pugnacious to tell him outright that\r\nhe was a liar. I endeavoured to convey it by a glance. He chatted\r\npleasantly for a few minutes more, then he mercifully departed.\r\nPeople passed and repassed, brisk couples \u201cexercising,\u201d curveting\r\nchildren, laughing young people. A few other pallid sufferers lay,\r\nlike myself, in deck-chairs.\r\n\r\nThe air was pleasant, crisp, not too cold, and the sun was shining\r\nbrightly. Insensibly, I felt a little cheered. I began to watch\r\nthe people. One woman in particular attracted me. She was about\r\nthirty, of medium height and very fair with a round dimpled face\r\nand very blue eyes. Her clothes, though perfectly plain, had that\r\nindefinable air of \u201ccut\u201d about them which spoke of Paris. Also, in\r\na pleasant but self-possessed way, she seemed to own the ship!\r\n\r\nDeck stewards ran to and fro obeying her commands. She had a\r\nspecial deck-chair, and an apparently inexhaustible supply of\r\ncushions. She changed her mind three times as to where she would\r\nlike it placed. Throughout everything she remained attractive and\r\ncharming. She appeared to be one of those rare people in the world\r\nwho know what they want, see that they get it, and manage to do so\r\nwithout being offensive. I decided that if I ever recovered\u2014but of\r\ncourse I shouldn\u2019t\u2014it would amuse me to talk to her.\r\n\r\nWe reached Madeira about midday. I was still too inert to move,\r\nbut I enjoyed the picturesque-looking merchants who came on board\r\nand spread their merchandise about the decks. There were flowers\r\ntoo. I buried my nose in an enormous bunch of sweet wet violets\r\nand felt distinctly better. In fact, I thought I might just possibly\r\nlast out the end of the voyage. When my stewardess spoke of the\r\nattractions of a little chicken broth, I only protested feebly.\r\nWhen it came I enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nMy attractive woman had been ashore. She came back escorted by a\r\ntall, soldierly-looking man with dark hair and a bronzed face whom\r\nI had noticed striding up and down the deck earlier in the day. I\r\nput him down at once as one of the strong, silent men of Rhodesia.\r\nHe was about forty, with a touch of greying hair at either temple,\r\nand was easily the best-looking man on board.\r\n\r\nWhen the stewardess brought me up an extra rug I asked her if she\r\nknew who my attractive woman was.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a well-known society lady, the Hon. Mrs. Clarence Blair.\r\nYou must have read about her in the papers.\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded, looking at her with renewed interest. Mrs. Blair was very\r\nwell known indeed as one of the smartest women of the day. I\r\nobserved, with some amusement, that she was the centre of a good\r\ndeal of attention. Several people essayed to scrape acquaintance\r\nwith the pleasant informality that a boat allows. I admired the\r\npolite way that Mrs. Blair snubbed them. She appeared to have\r\nadopted the strong, silent man as her special cavalier, and he\r\nseemed duly sensible of the privilege accorded him.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, to my surprise, after taking a few turns\r\nround the deck with her attentive companion, Mrs. Blair came to a\r\nhalt by my chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cFeeling better this morning?\u201d\r\n\r\nI thanked her, and said I felt slightly more like a human being.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did look ill yesterday. Colonel Race and I decided that we\r\nshould have the excitement of a funeral at sea\u2014but you\u2019ve\r\ndisappointed us.\u201d\r\n\r\nI laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cBeing up in the air has done me good.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing like fresh air,\u201d said Colonel Race, smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cBeing shut up in those stuffy cabins would kill any one,\u201d declared\r\nMrs. Blair, dropping into a seat by my side and dismissing her\r\ncompanion with a little nod. \u201cYou\u2019ve got an outside one, I hope?\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear girl! Why don\u2019t you change? There\u2019s plenty of room. A lot\r\nof people got off at Madeira, and the boat\u2019s very empty. Talk to\r\nthe purser about it. He\u2019s a nice little boy\u2014he changed me into a\r\nbeautiful cabin because I didn\u2019t care for the one I\u2019d got. You talk\r\nto him at lunch-time when you go down.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shuddered.\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t move.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. Come and take a walk now with me.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe dimpled at me encouragingly. I felt very weak on my legs at\r\nfirst, but as we walked briskly up and down I began to feel a\r\nbrighter and better being.\r\n\r\nAfter a turn or two, Colonel Race joined us again.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can see the Grand Peak of Tenerife from the other side.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan we? Can I get a photograph of it, do you think?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014but that won\u2019t deter you from snapping off at it.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Blair laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are unkind. Some of my photographs are very good.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout three per cent effective, I should say.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe all went round to the other side of the deck. There glimmering\r\nwhite and snowy, enveloped in a delicate rose-coloured mist, rose\r\nthe glistening pinnacle. I uttered an exclamation of delight. Mrs.\r\nBlair ran for her camera.\r\n\r\nUndeterred by Colonel Race\u2019s sardonic comments, she snapped\r\nvigorously:\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, that\u2019s the end of the roll. Oh,\u201d her tone changed to one\r\nof chagrin, \u201cI\u2019ve had the thing at \u2018bulb\u2019 all the time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI always like to see a child with a new toy,\u201d murmured the Colonel.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow horrid you are\u2014but I\u2019ve got another roll.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe produced it in triumph from the pocket of her sweater. A sudden\r\nroll of the boat upset her balance, and as she caught at the rail\r\nto steady herself the roll of films flashed over the side.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d cried Mrs. Blair, comically dismayed. She leaned over. \u201cDo\r\nyou think they have gone overboard?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, you may have been fortunate enough to brain an unlucky steward\r\nin the deck below.\u201d\r\n\r\nA small boy who had arrived unobserved a few paces to our rear blew\r\na deafening blast on a bugle.\r\n\r\n\u201cLunch,\u201d declared Mrs. Blair ecstatically. \u201cI\u2019ve had nothing to\r\neat since breakfast, except two cups of beef-tea. Lunch, Miss\r\nBeddingfeld?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said waveringly. \u201cYes, I _do_ feel rather hungry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSplendid. You\u2019re sitting at the purser\u2019s table, I know. Tackle\r\nhim about the cabin.\u201d\r\n\r\nI found my way down to the saloon, began to eat gingerly, and\r\nfinished by consuming an enormous meal. My friend of yesterday\r\ncongratulated me on my recovery. Every one was changing cabins\r\nto-day, he told me, and he promised that my things should be moved\r\nto an outside one without delay.\r\n\r\nThere were only four at our table, myself, a couple of elderly\r\nladies, and a missionary who talked a lot about \u201cour poor black\r\nbrothers.\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked round at the other tables. Mrs. Blair was sitting at the\r\nCaptain\u2019s table, Colonel Race next to her. On the other side of\r\nthe Captain was a distinguished-looking, grey-haired man. A good\r\nmany people I had already noticed on deck, but there was one man\r\nwho had not previously appeared. Had he done so, he could hardly\r\nhave escaped my notice. He was tall and dark, and had such a\r\npeculiarly sinister type of countenance that I was quite startled.\r\nI asked the purser, with some curiosity, who he was.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat man? Oh, that\u2019s Sir Eustace Pedler\u2019s secretary. Been very\r\nsea-sick, poor chap, and not appeared before. Sir Eustace has got\r\ntwo secretaries with him, and the sea\u2019s been too much for both of\r\nthem. The other fellow hasn\u2019t turned up yet. This man\u2019s name is\r\nPagett.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo Sir Eustace Pedler, the owner of the Mill House, was on board.\r\nProbably only a coincidence, and yet\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Sir Eustace,\u201d my informant continued, \u201csitting next to the\r\nCaptain. Pompous old ass.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe more I studied the secretary\u2019s face, the less I liked it. Its\r\neven pallor, the secretive, heavy-lidded eyes, the curiously\r\nflattened head\u2014it all gave me a feeling of distaste, of apprehension.\r\n\r\nLeaving the saloon at the same time as he did, I was close behind\r\nhim as he went up on deck. He was speaking to Sir Eustace, and I\r\noverheard a fragment or two. \u201cI\u2019ll see about the cabin at once\r\nthen, shall I? It\u2019s impossible to work in yours, with all your\r\ntrunks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d Sir Eustace replied. \u201cMy cabin is intended (a)\r\nfor me to sleep in, and (b) to attempt to dress in. I never had\r\nany intentions of allowing you to sprawl about the place making an\r\ninfernal clicking with that typewriter of yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just what I say, Sir Eustace, we must have somewhere to\r\nwork\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nHere I parted company from them, and went below to see if my\r\nremoval was in progress. I found my steward busy at the task.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery nice cabin, miss. On D deck. No. 13.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no!\u201d I cried. \u201c_Not_ 13.\u201d\r\n\r\nThirteen is the one thing I am superstitious about. It was a nice\r\ncabin too. I inspected it, wavered, but a foolish superstition\r\nprevailed. I appealed almost tearfully to the steward.\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there any other cabin I can have?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe steward reflected.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s 17, just along on the starboard side. That was empty\r\nthis morning, but I rather fancy it\u2019s been allotted to some one.\r\nStill, as the gentleman\u2019s things aren\u2019t in yet, and as gentlemen\r\naren\u2019t anything like so superstitious as ladies, I dare say he\r\nwouldn\u2019t mind changing.\u201d\r\n\r\nI hailed the proposition gratefully, and the steward departed to\r\nobtain permission from the purser. He returned grinning.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right, miss. We can go along.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe led the way to 17. It was not quite as large as No. 13, but I\r\nfound it eminently satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll fetch your things right away, miss,\u201d said the steward.\r\n\r\nBut at that moment, the man with the sinister face (as I had\r\nnicknamed him) appeared in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said, \u201cbut this cabin is reserved for the use of\r\nSir Eustace Pedler.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right, sir,\u201d explained the steward. \u201cWe\u2019re fitting up\r\nNo. 13 instead.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it was No. 17 I was to have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. 13 is a better cabin, sir\u2014larger.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI specially selected No. 17, and the purser said I could have it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said coldly. \u201cBut No. 17 has been allotted to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t agree to that.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe steward put in his oar.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe other cabin\u2019s just the same, only better.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI want No. 17.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d demanded a new voice. \u201cSteward, put my things\r\nin here. This is my cabin.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was my neighbor at lunch, the Rev. Edward Chichester.\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s my cabin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is allotted to Sir Eustace Pedler,\u201d said Mr. Pagett.\r\n\r\nWe were all getting rather heated.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to have to dispute the matter,\u201d said Chichester with a\r\nmeek smile which failed to mask his determination to get his own\r\nway. Meek men are always obstinate, I have noticed.\r\n\r\nHe edged himself sideways into the doorway.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re to have No. 28 on the port side,\u201d said the steward. \u201cA very\r\ngood cabin, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am afraid that I must insist. No. 17 was the cabin promised to\r\nme.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had come to an impasse. Each one of us was determined not to\r\ngive way. Strictly speaking, I, at any rate, might have retired\r\nfrom the contest and eased matters by offering to accept Cabin 28.\r\nSo long as I did not have 13 it was immaterial to me what other\r\ncabin I had. But my blood was up. I had not the least intention of\r\nbeing the first to give way. And I disliked Chichester. He had\r\nfalse teeth which clicked when he ate. Many men have been hated\r\nfor less.\r\n\r\nWe all said the same things over again. The steward assured us,\r\neven more strongly, that both the other cabins were better cabins.\r\nNone of us paid any attention to him.\r\n\r\nPagett began to lose his temper. Chichester kept his serenely. With\r\nan effort I also kept mine. And still none of us would give way an\r\ninch.\r\n\r\nA wink and a whispered word from the steward gave me my cue. I\r\nfaded unobtrusively from the scene. I was lucky enough to encounter\r\nthe purser almost immediately.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, please,\u201d I said, \u201cyou did say I could have Cabin 17? And the\r\nothers won\u2019t go away. Mr. Chichester and Mr. Pagett. You _will_\r\nlet me have it, won\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\nI always say that there are no people like sailors for being nice\r\nto women. My little purser came to the scratch splendidly. He\r\nstrode to the scene, informed the disputants that No. 17 was my\r\ncabin, they could have Nos. 13 and 28 respectively or stay where\r\nthey were\u2014whichever they chose.\r\n\r\nI permitted my eyes to tell him what a hero he was and then\r\ninstalled myself in my new domain. The encounter had done me worlds\r\nof good. The sea was smooth, the weather growing daily warmer.\r\nSea-sickness was a thing of the past!\r\n\r\nI went up on deck and was initiated into the mysteries of\r\ndeck-quoits. I entered my name for various sports. Tea was served\r\non deck, and I ate heartily. After tea, I played shovel-board with\r\nsome pleasant young men. They were extraordinarily nice to me. I\r\nfelt that life was satisfactory and delightful.\r\n\r\nThe dressing bugle came as a surprise and I hurried to my new\r\ncabin. The stewardess was awaiting me with a troubled face.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a terrible smell in your cabin, miss. What it is, I\u2019m sure\r\nI can\u2019t think, but I doubt if you\u2019ll be able to sleep here. There\u2019s\r\na deck cabin up on C deck, I believe. You might move into that\u2014just\r\nfor the night, anyway.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe smell really was pretty bad\u2014quite nauseating. I told the\r\nstewardess I would think over the question of moving whilst I\r\ndressed. I hurried over my toilet, sniffing distastefully as I did\r\nso.\r\n\r\nWhat _was_ the smell? Dead rat? No, worse than that\u2014and quite\r\ndifferent. Yet I knew it! It was something I had smelt before.\r\nSomething\u2014\u2014Ah! I had got it. Asaf\u0153tida! I had worked in a Hospital\r\ndispensary during the war for a short time and had become acquainted\r\nwith various nauseous drugs.\r\n\r\nAsaf\u0153tida, that was it. But how\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\nI sank down on the sofa, suddenly realizing the thing. Somebody\r\nhad put a pinch of asaf\u0153tida in my cabin. Why? So that I should\r\nvacate it? Why were they so anxious to get me out? I thought of\r\nthe scene this afternoon from a rather different point of view.\r\nWhat was there about Cabin 17 that made so many people anxious to\r\nget hold of it? The other two cabins were better cabins, why had\r\nboth men insisted on sticking to 17?\r\n\r\n17. How the number persisted. It was on the 17th I had sailed from\r\nSouthampton. It was a 17\u2014I stopped with a sudden gasp. Quickly I\r\nunlocked my suit-case, and took my precious paper from its place\r\nof concealment in some rolled stockings.\r\n\r\n17 1 22\u2014I had taken that for a date, the date of departure of the\r\n_Kilmorden Castle._ Supposing I was wrong. When I came to think of\r\nit, would any one, writing down a date, think it necessary to put\r\nthe year as well as the month? Supposing 17 meant _Cabin_ 17? And\r\n1? The time\u2014one o\u2019clock. Then 22 must be the date. I looked up at\r\nmy little almanac.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow was the 22nd!\r\n\nI was violently excited. I was sure that I had hit on the right\r\ntrail at last. One thing was clear, I must not move out of the\r\ncabin. The asaf\u0153tida had got to be borne. I examined my facts\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow was the 22nd, and at 1 a.m. or 1 p.m. something would\r\nhappen. I plumped for 1 a.m. It was now seven o\u2019clock. In six hours\r\nI should know.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how I got through the evening. I retired to my cabin\r\nfairly early. I had told the stewardess that I had a cold in the\r\nhead and didn\u2019t mind smells. She still seemed distressed, but I\r\nwas firm.\r\n\r\nThe evening seemed interminable. I duly retired to bed, but in view\r\nof emergencies I swathed myself in a thick flannel dressing-gown,\r\nand encased my feet in slippers. Thus attired I felt that I could\r\nspring up and take an active part in anything that happened.\r\n\r\nWhat did I expect to happen? I hardly knew. Vague fancies, most of\r\nthem wildly improbable, flitted through my brain. But one thing I\r\nwas firmly convinced of, at one o\u2019clock _something_ would happen.\r\n\r\nAt various times, I heard my fellow-passengers coming to bed.\r\nFragments of conversation, laughing good-nights, floated in through\r\nthe open transom. Then, silence. Most of the lights went out. There\r\nwas still one in the passage outside, and there was therefore a\r\ncertain amount of light in my cabin. I heard eight bells go. The\r\nhour that followed seemed the longest I had ever known. I consulted\r\nmy watch surreptitiously to be sure I had not overshot the time.\r\n\r\nIf my deductions were wrong, if nothing happened at one o\u2019clock,\r\nI should have made a fool of myself, and spent all the money I had\r\nin the world on a mare\u2019s-nest. My heart beat painfully.\r\n\r\nTwo bells went overhead. One o\u2019clock! And nothing. Wait\u2014what was\r\nthat? I heard the quick light patter of feet running\u2014running along\r\nthe passage.\r\n\r\nThen with the suddenness of a bombshell my cabin door burst open\r\nand a man almost fell inside.\r\n\r\n\u201cSave me,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cThey\u2019re after me.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was not a moment for argument or explanation. I could hear\r\nfootsteps outside. I had about forty seconds in which to act. I\r\nhad sprung to my feet and was standing facing the stranger in the\r\nmiddle of the cabin.\r\n\r\nA cabin does not abound in hiding-places for a six-foot man. With\r\none arm I pulled out my cabin trunk. He slipped down behind it\r\nunder the bunk. I raised the lid. At the same time, with the other\r\nhand I pulled down the wash-basin. A deft movement and my hair was\r\nscrewed into a tiny knot on the top of my head. From the point of\r\nview of appearance it was inartistic, from another standpoint it\r\nwas supremely artistic. A lady, with her hair screwed into an\r\nunbecoming knob and in the act of removing a piece of soap from\r\nher trunk with which, apparently to wash her neck, could hardly be\r\nsuspected of harbouring a fugitive.\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door, and without waiting for me to say,\r\n\u201cCome in,\u201d it was pushed open.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know what I expected to see. I think I had vague ideas of\r\nMr. Pagett brandishing a revolver. Or my missionary friend with a\r\nsandbag, or some other lethal weapon. But certainly I did not\r\nexpect to see a night stewardess, with an inquiring face and\r\nlooking the essence of respectability.\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon, miss, I thought you called out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for interrupting you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d I said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep. I thought a wash\r\nwould do me good.\u201d It sounded rather as though it were a thing I\r\nnever had as a general rule.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, miss,\u201d said the stewardess again. \u201cBut there\u2019s a\r\ngentleman about who\u2019s rather drunk, and we are afraid he might get\r\ninto one of the ladies\u2019 cabins and frighten them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow dreadful,\u201d I said, looking alarmed. \u201cHe won\u2019t come in here,\r\nwill he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think so, miss. Ring the bell if he does. Good night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood night.\u201d\r\n\r\nI opened the door and peeped down the corridor. Except for the\r\nretreating form of the stewardess, there was nobody in sight.\r\n\r\nDrunk! So that was the explanation of it. My histrionic talents\r\nhad been wasted. I pulled the cabin trunk out a little farther and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\u201cCome out at once, please,\u201d in an acid voice.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer. I peered under the bunk. My visitor lay\r\nimmovable. He seemed to be asleep. I tugged at his shoulder. He\r\ndid not move.\r\n\r\n\u201cDead drunk,\u201d I thought vexedly. \u201cWhat _am_ I to do?\u201d\r\n\r\nThen I saw something that made me catch my breath, a small scarlet\r\nspot on the floor.\r\n\r\nUsing all my strength, I succeeded in dragging the man out into\r\nthe middle of the cabin. The dead whiteness of his face showed that\r\nhe had fainted. I found the cause of his fainting easily enough.\r\nHe had been stabbed under the left shoulder-blade\u2014a nasty deep\r\nwound. I got his coat off and set to work to attend to it.\r\n\r\nAt the sting of the cold water he stirred, then sat up.\r\n\r\n\u201cKeep still, please,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\nHe was the kind of young man who recovers his faculties very\r\nquickly. He pulled himself to his feet and stood there swaying a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, I don\u2019t need anything done for me.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis manner was defiant, almost aggressive. Not a word of thanks\u2014of\r\neven common gratitude!\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a nasty wound. You must let me dress it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will do nothing of the kind.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe flung the words in my face as though I had been begging a favour\r\nof him. My temper, never placid, rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot congratulate you upon your manners,\u201d I said coldly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can at least relieve you of my presence.\u201d He started for the\r\ndoor, but reeled as he did so. With an abrupt movement I pushed\r\nhim down upon the sofa.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d I said unceremoniously. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go\r\nbleeding all over the ship, do you?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe seemed to see the sense of that, for he sat quietly whilst I\r\nbandaged up the wound as best I could.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d I said, bestowing a pat on my handiwork, \u201cthat will have\r\nto do for the present. Are you better tempered now and do you feel\r\ninclined to tell me what it\u2019s all about?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that I can\u2019t satisfy your very natural curiosity.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d I said, chagrined.\r\n\r\nHe smiled nastily.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you want a thing broadcasted, tell a woman. Otherwise keep your\r\nmouth shut.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think I could keep a secret?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014I know.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt any rate,\u201d I said spitefully, \u201cI shall be able to do a little\r\nbroadcasting about the events of this evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve no doubt you will too,\u201d he said indifferently.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow dare you?\u201d I cried angrily.\r\n\r\nWe were facing each other, glaring at each other with the ferocity\r\nof bitter enemies. For the first time, I took in the details of\r\nhis appearance, the close-cropped dark head, the lean jaw, the scar\r\non the brown cheek, the curious light grey eyes that looked into\r\nmine with a sort of reckless mockery hard to describe. There was\r\nsomething dangerous about him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t thanked me yet for saving your life?\u201d I said with\r\nfalse sweetness.\r\n\r\nI hit him there. I saw him flinch distinctly. Intuitively I knew\r\nthat he hated above all to be reminded that he owed his life to\r\nme. I didn\u2019t care. I wanted to hurt him. I had never wanted to hurt\r\nany one so much.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish to God you hadn\u2019t!\u201d he said explosively. \u201cI\u2019d be better\r\ndead and out of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you acknowledge the debt. You can\u2019t get out of it. I\r\nsaved your life and I\u2019m waiting for you to say \u2018Thank you.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nIf looks could have killed, I think he would have liked to kill me\r\nthen. He pushed roughly past me. At the door he turned back, and\r\nspoke over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall not thank you\u2014now or at any other time. But I acknowledge\r\nthe debt. Some day I will pay it.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was gone, leaving me with clenched hands, and my heart beating\r\nlike a mill race.\r\n\nThere were no further excitements that night. I had breakfast in\r\nbed and got up late the next morning. Mrs. Blair hailed me as I\r\ncame on deck.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-morning, Gipsy girl, sit down here by me. You look as though\r\nyou hadn\u2019t slept well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you call me that?\u201d I asked, as I sat down obediently.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mind? It suits you somehow. I\u2019ve called you that in my own\r\nmind from the beginning. It\u2019s the gipsy element in you that makes\r\nyou so different from any one else. I decided in my own mind that\r\nyou and Colonel Race were the only two people on board who wouldn\u2019t\r\nbore me to death to talk to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d I said, \u201cI thought the same about you\u2014only it\u2019s\r\nmore understandable in your case. You\u2019re\u2014you\u2019re such an exquisitely\r\nfinished product.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot badly put,\u201d said Mrs. Blair, nodding her head. \u201cTell me all\r\nabout yourself, Gipsy girl. Why are you going to South Africa?\u201d\r\n\r\nI told her something about Papa\u2019s life work.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re Charles Beddingfeld\u2019s daughter? I thought you weren\u2019t\r\na mere provincial Miss! Are you going to Broken Hill to grub up\r\nmore skulls?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI may,\u201d I said cautiously. \u201cI\u2019ve got other plans as well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a mysterious minx you are. But you do look tired this morning.\r\nDidn\u2019t you sleep well? I can\u2019t keep awake on board a boat. Ten\r\nhours\u2019 sleep for a fool, they say! I could do with twenty!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe yawned, looking like a sleepy kitten. \u201cAn idiot of a steward\r\nwoke me up in the middle of the night to return me that roll of\r\nfilms I dropped yesterday. He did it in the most melodramatic\r\nmanner, stuck his arm through the ventilator and dropped them\r\nnearly in the middle of my tummy. I thought it was a bomb for a\r\nmoment!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s your Colonel,\u201d I said, as the tall soldierly figure of\r\nColonel Race appeared on the deck.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not my Colonel particularly. In fact he admires _you_ very\r\nmuch, Gipsy girl. So don\u2019t run away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to tie something round my head. It will be more comfortable\r\nthan a hat.\u201d\r\n\r\nI slipped quickly away. For some reason or other I was uncomfortable\r\nwith Colonel Race. He was one of the few people who were capable\r\nof making me feel shy.\r\n\r\nI went down to my cabin and began looking for a broad band of\r\nribbon, or a motor-veil, with which I could restrain my rebellious\r\nlocks. Now I am a tidy person, I like my things always arranged in\r\na certain way and I keep them so. I had no sooner opened my drawer\r\nthan I realized that somebody had been disarranging my things.\r\nEverything had been turned over and scattered. I looked in the\r\nother drawers and the small hanging cupboard. They told me the same\r\ntale. It was as though some one had been making a hurried and\r\nineffectual search for something.\r\n\r\nI sat down on the edge of the bunk with a grave face. Who had been\r\nsearching my cabin and what had they been looking for? Was it the\r\nhalf-sheet of paper with scribbled figures and words? I shook my\r\nhead, dissatisfied. Surely that was past history now. But what else\r\ncould there be?\r\n\r\nI wanted to think. The events of last night, though exciting, had\r\nnot really done anything to elucidate matters. Who was the young\r\nman who had burst into my cabin so abruptly? I had not seen him on\r\nboard previously, either on deck or in the saloon. Was he one of\r\nthe ship\u2019s company or was he a passenger? Who had stabbed him? Why\r\nhad they stabbed him? And why, in the name of goodness, should\r\nCabin No. 17 figure so prominently? It was all a mystery, but there\r\nwas no doubt that some very peculiar occurrences were taking place\r\non the _Kilmorden Castle._\r\n\r\nI counted off on my fingers the people on whom it behoved me to\r\nkeep a watch.\r\n\r\nSetting aside my visitor of the night before, but promising myself\r\nthat I would discover him on board before another day had passed,\r\nI selected the following persons as worthy of my notice.\r\n\r\n(1) Sir Eustace Pedler. He was the owner of the Mill House and his\r\npresence on the _Kilmorden Castle_ seemed something of a coincidence.\r\n\r\n(2) Mr. Pagett, the sinister-looking secretary, whose eagerness to\r\nobtain Cabin 17 had been so very marked. N.B. Find out whether he\r\nhad accompanied Sir Eustace to Cannes.\r\n\r\n(3) The Rev. Edward Chichester. All I had against him was his\r\nobstinacy over Cabin 17, and that might be entirely due to his own\r\npeculiar temperament. Obstinacy can be an amazing thing.\r\n\r\nBut a little conversation with Mr. Chichester would not come amiss,\r\nI decided. Hastily tying a handkerchief round my rebellious locks,\r\nI went up on deck again, full of purpose. I was in luck. My quarry\r\nwas leaning against the rail, drinking beef tea. I went up to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope you\u2019ve forgiven me over Cabin 17,\u201d I said, with my best\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\u201cI consider it unchristian to bear a grudge,\u201d said Mr. Chichester\r\ncoldly. \u201cBut the purser had distinctly promised me that cabin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPursers are such busy men, aren\u2019t they?\u201d I said vaguely. \u201cI\r\nsuppose they\u2019re bound to forget sometimes.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Chichester did not reply.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs this your first visit to Africa?\u201d I inquired conversationally.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo South Africa, yes. But I have worked for the last two years\r\namongst the cannibal tribes in the interior of East Africa.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow thrilling! Have you had many narrow escapes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEscapes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf being eaten, I mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou should not treat sacred subjects with levity, Miss Beddingfeld.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that cannibalism was a sacred subject,\u201d I retorted,\r\nstung.\r\n\r\nAs the words left my lips, another idea struck me. If Mr. Chichester\r\nhad indeed spent the last two years in the interior of Africa, how\r\nwas it that he was not more sunburnt? His skin was as pink and\r\nwhite as a baby\u2019s. Surely there was something fishy there? Yet his\r\nmanner and voice were so absolutely _it._ Too much so perhaps. Was\r\nhe\u2014or was he not\u2014just a little like a _stage_ clergyman?\r\n\r\nI cast my mind back to the curates I had known at Little Hampsly.\r\nSome of them I had liked, some of them I had not, but certainly\r\nnone of them had been quite like Mr. Chichester. They had been\r\nhuman\u2014he was a glorified type.\r\n\r\nI was debating all this when Sir Eustace Pedler passed down the\r\ndeck. Just as he was abreast of Mr. Chichester, he stooped and\r\npicked up a piece of paper which he handed to him, remarking\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve dropped something.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe passed on without stopping, and so probably did not notice Mr.\r\nChichester\u2019s agitation. I did. Whatever it was he had dropped, its\r\nrecovery agitated him considerably. He turned a sickly green, and\r\ncrumpled up the sheet of paper into a ball. My suspicions were\r\naccentuated a hundred-fold.\r\n\r\nHe caught my eye, and hurried into explanations.\r\n\r\n\u201cA\u2014a\u2014fragment of a sermon I was composing,\u201d he said with a sickly\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed?\u201d I rejoined politely.\r\n\r\nA fragment of a sermon, indeed! No, Mr. Chichester\u2014too weak for\r\nwords!\r\n\r\nHe soon left me with a muttered excuse. I wished, oh, how I wished,\r\nthat I had been the one to pick up that paper and not Sir Eustace\r\nPedler! One thing was clear, Mr. Chichester could not be exempted\r\nfrom my list of suspects. I was inclined to put him top of the\r\nthree.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, when I came up to the lounge for coffee, I noticed\r\nSir Eustace and Pagett sitting with Mrs. Blair and Colonel Race.\r\nMrs. Blair welcomed me with a smile, so I went over and joined\r\nthem. They were talking about Italy.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it _is_ misleading,\u201d Mrs. Blair insisted. _\u201cAqua calda_\r\ncertainly _ought_ to be cold water\u2014not hot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a Latin scholar,\u201d said Sir Eustace, smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cMen are so superior about their Latin,\u201d said Mrs. Blair. \u201cBut all\r\nthe same I notice that when you ask them to translate inscriptions\r\nin old churches they can never do it! They hem and haw, and get\r\nout of it somehow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite right,\u201d said Colonel Race. \u201cI always do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I love the Italians,\u201d continued Mrs. Blair. \u201cThey\u2019re so\r\nobliging\u2014though even that has its embarrassing side. You ask them\r\nthe way somewhere, and instead of saying \u2018first to the right,\r\nsecond to the left\u2019 or something that one could follow, they pour\r\nout a flood of well-meaning directions, and when you look bewildered\r\nthey take you kindly by the arm and walk all the way there with\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that your experience in Florence, Pagett?\u201d asked Sir Eustace,\r\nturning with a smile to his secretary.\r\n\r\nFor some reason the question seemed to disconcert Mr. Pagett. He\r\nstammered and flushed.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, quite so, yes\u2014er quite so.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen with a murmured excuse, he rose and left the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am beginning to suspect Guy Pagett of having committed some dark\r\ndeed in Florence,\u201d remarked Sir Eustace, gazing after his\r\nsecretary\u2019s retreating figure. \u201cWhenever Florence or Italy is\r\nmentioned, he changes the subject, or bolts precipitately.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps he murdered some one there,\u201d said Mrs. Blair hopefully.\r\n\u201cHe looks\u2014I hope I\u2019m not hurting your feelings, Sir Eustace\u2014but he\r\ndoes look as though he might murder some one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, pure Cinquecento! It amuses me sometimes\u2014especially when one\r\nknows as well as I do how essentially law-abiding and respectable\r\nthe poor fellow really is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s been with you some time, hasn\u2019t he, Sir Eustace?\u201d asked\r\nColonel Race.\r\n\r\n\u201cSix years,\u201d said Sir Eustace, with a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe must be quite invaluable to you,\u201d said Mrs. Blair.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, invaluable! Yes, quite invaluable.\u201d The poor man sounded even\r\nmore depressed, as though the invaluableness of Mr. Pagett was a\r\nsecret grief to him. Then he added more briskly: \u201cBut his face\r\nshould really inspire you with confidence, my dear lady. No\r\nself-respecting murderer would ever consent to look like one.\r\nCrippen, now, I believe, was one of the pleasantest fellows\r\nimaginable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was caught on a liner, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d murmured Mrs. Blair.\r\n\r\nThere was a slight rattle behind us. I turned quickly. Mr.\r\nChichester had dropped his coffee-cup.\r\n\r\nOur party soon broke up; Mrs. Blair went below to sleep and I went\r\nout on deck. Colonel Race followed me.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re very elusive, Miss Beddingfeld. I looked for you everywhere\r\nlast night at the dance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI went to bed early,\u201d I explained.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you going to run away to-night too? Or are you going to dance\r\nwith me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall be very pleased to dance with you,\u201d I murmured shyly. \u201cBut\r\nMrs. Blair\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOur friend, Mrs. Blair, doesn\u2019t care for dancing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI care for dancing with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d I said nervously.\r\n\r\nI was a little afraid of Colonel Race. Nevertheless I was enjoying\r\nmyself. This was better than discussing fossilized skulls with\r\nstuffy old professors! Colonel Race was really just my ideal of a\r\nstern silent Rhodesian. Possibly I might marry him! I hadn\u2019t been\r\nasked, it is true, but, as the Boy Scouts say, Be Prepared! And\r\nall women, without in the least meaning it, consider every man they\r\nmeet as a possible husband for themselves or for their best friend.\r\n\r\nI danced several times with him that evening. He danced well. When\r\nthe dancing was over, and I was thinking of going to bed, he\r\nsuggested a turn round the deck. We walked round three times and\r\nfinally subsided into two deck-chairs. There was nobody else in\r\nsight. We made desultory conversation for some time.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know, Miss Beddingfeld, I think that I once met your\r\nfather? A very interesting man\u2014on his own subject, and it\u2019s a\r\nsubject that has a special fascination for me. In my humble way,\r\nI\u2019ve done a bit in that line myself. Why, when I was in the Dordogne\r\nregion\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nOur talk became technical. Colonel Race\u2019s boast was not an idle\r\none. He knew a great deal. At the same time, he made one or two\r\ncurious mistakes\u2014slips of the tongue, I might almost have thought\r\nthem. But he was quick to take his cue from me and to cover them\r\nup. Once he spoke of the Mousterian period as succeeding the\r\nAurignacian\u2014an absurd mistake for one who knew anything of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIt was twelve o\u2019clock when I went to my cabin. I was still puzzling\r\nover those queer discrepancies. Was it possible that he had \u201cgot\r\nthe whole subject up\u201d for the occasion\u2014that really he knew nothing\r\nof archaeology? I shook my head, vaguely dissatisfied with that\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nJust as I was dropping off to sleep, I sat up with a sudden start\r\nas another idea flashed into my head. Had _he_ been pumping _me?_\r\nWere those slight inaccuracies just tests\u2014to see whether I really\r\nknew what I was talking about? In other words, he suspected me of\r\nnot being genuinely Anne Beddingfeld.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\n  _(Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is something to be said for life on board ship. It is\r\npeaceful. My grey hairs fortunately exempt me from the indignities\r\nof bobbing for apples, running up and down the deck with potatoes\r\nand eggs, and the more painful sports of \u201cBrother Bill\u201d and Bolster\r\nBar. What amusement people can find in these painful proceedings\r\nhas always been a mystery to me. But there are many fools in the\r\nworld. One praises God for their existence and keeps out of their\r\nway.\r\n\r\nFortunately I am an excellent sailor. Pagett, poor fellow, is not.\r\nHe began turning green as soon as we were out of the Solent. I\r\npresume my other so-called secretary is also sea-sick. At any rate\r\nhe has not yet made his appearance. But perhaps it is not\r\nsea-sickness, but high diplomacy. The great thing is that I have\r\nnot been worried by him.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the people on board are a mangy lot. Only two decent\r\nBridge players and one decent-looking woman\u2014Mrs. Clarence Blair.\r\nI\u2019ve met her in town of course. She is one of the only women I know\r\nwho can lay claim to a sense of humour. I enjoy talking to her,\r\nand should enjoy it more if it were not for a long-legged taciturn\r\nass who has attached himself to her like a limpet. I cannot think\r\nthat this Colonel Race really amuses her. He\u2019s good-looking in his\r\nway, but dull as ditch water. One of these strong silent men that\r\nlady novelists and young girls always rave over.\r\n\r\nGuy Pagett struggled up on deck after we left Madeira and began\r\nbabbling in a hollow voice about work. What the devil does any one\r\nwant to work for on board ship? It is true that I promised my\r\npublishers my \u201cReminiscences\u201d early in the summer, but what of it?\r\nWho really reads reminiscences? Old ladies in the suburbs. And what\r\ndo my reminiscences amount to? I\u2019ve knocked against a certain\r\nnumber of so-called famous people in my lifetime. With the\r\nassistance of Pagett, I invent insipid anecdotes about them. And,\r\nthe truth of the matter is, Pagett is too honest for the job. He\r\nwon\u2019t let me invent anecdotes about the people I might have met\r\nbut haven\u2019t.\r\n\r\nI tried kindness with him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou look a perfect wreck still, my dear chap,\u201d I said easily.\r\n\u201cWhat you need is a deck-chair in the sun. No\u2014not another word.\r\nThe work must wait.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe next thing I knew he was worrying about an extra cabin. \u201cThere\u2019s\r\nno room to work in your cabin, Sir Eustace. It\u2019s full of trunks.\u201d\r\n\r\nFrom his tone, you might have thought that trunks were blackbeetles,\r\nsomething that had no business to be there.\r\n\r\nI explained to him that, though he might not be aware of the fact,\r\nit was usual to take a change of clothing with one when travelling.\r\nHe gave the wan smile with which he always greets my attempts at\r\nhumour, and then reverted to the business in hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd we could hardly work in my little hole.\u201d\r\n\r\nI know Pagett\u2019s \u201clittle holes\u201d\u2014he usually has the best cabin on\r\nthe ship.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry the Captain didn\u2019t turn out for you this time,\u201d I said\r\nsarcastically. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019d like to dump some of your extra\r\nluggage in my cabin?\u201d\r\n\r\nSarcasm is dangerous with a man like Pagett. He brightened up at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, if I could get rid of the typewriter and the stationery\r\ntrunk\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nThe stationery trunk weighs several solid tons. It causes endless\r\nunpleasantness with the porters, and it is the aim of Pagett\u2019s life\r\nto foist it on me. It is a perpetual struggle between us. He seems\r\nto regard it as my special personal property. I, on the other hand,\r\nregard the charge of it as the only thing where a secretary is\r\nreally useful.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get an extra cabin,\u201d I said hastily.\r\n\r\nThe thing seemed simple enough, but Pagett is a person who loves\r\nto make mysteries. He came to me the next day with a face like a\r\nRenaissance conspirator.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know you told me to get Cabin 17 for an office?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what of it? Has the stationery trunk jammed in the doorway?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe doorways are the same size in all the cabins,\u201d replied Pagett\r\nseriously. \u201cBut I tell you, Sir Eustace, there\u2019s something very\r\nqueer about that cabin.\u201d\r\n\r\nMemories of reading _The Upper Berth_ floated through my mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you mean that it\u2019s haunted,\u201d I said, \u201cwe\u2019re not going to sleep\r\nthere, so I don\u2019t see that it matters. Ghosts don\u2019t affect\r\ntypewriters.\u201d\r\n\r\nPagett said that it wasn\u2019t a ghost, and that, after all, he hadn\u2019t\r\ngot Cabin 17. He told me a long, garbled story. Apparently he, and\r\na Mr. Chichester, and a girl called Beddingfeld, had almost come\r\nto blows over the cabin. Needless to say, the girl had won, and\r\nPagett was apparently feeling sore over the matter.\r\n\r\n\u201cBoth 13 and 28 are better cabins,\u201d he reiterated. \u201cBut they\r\nwouldn\u2019t look at them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, stifling a yawn, \u201cfor that matter, no more would\r\nyou, my dear Pagett.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe gave me a reproachful look.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou _told_ me to get Cabin 17.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere is a touch of the \u201cboy upon the burning deck\u201d about Pagett.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d I said testily, \u201cI mentioned No. 17 because I\r\nhappened to observe that it was vacant. But I didn\u2019t mean you to\r\nmake a stand to the death about it\u201413 or 28 would have done us\r\nequally well.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked hurt.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s something more, though,\u201d he insisted. \u201cMiss Beddingfeld\r\ngot the cabin, but this morning I saw Chichester coming out of it\r\nin a furtive sort of way.\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked at him severely.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to get up a nasty scandal about Chichester, who\r\nis a missionary\u2014though a perfectly poisonous person\u2014and that\r\nattractive child, Anne Beddingfeld, I don\u2019t believe a word of it,\u201d\r\nI said coldly. \u201cAnne Beddingfeld is an extremely nice girl\u2014with\r\nparticularly good legs. I should say she had far and away the best\r\nlegs on board.\u201d\r\n\r\nPagett did not like my reference to Anne Beddingfeld\u2019s legs. He is\r\nthe sort of man who never notices legs himself\u2014or, if he does,\r\nwould die sooner than say so. Also he thinks my appreciation of\r\nsuch things frivolous. I like annoying Pagett, so I continued\r\nmaliciously:\r\n\r\n\u201cAs you\u2019ve made her acquaintance, you might ask her to dine at our\r\ntable to-morrow night. It\u2019s the Fancy Dress dance. By the way,\r\nyou\u2019d better go down to the barber and select a fancy costume for\r\nme.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely you will not go in fancy dress?\u201d said Pagett, in tones of\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\nI could see that it was quite incompatible with his idea of my\r\ndignity. He looked shocked and pained. I had really had no intention\r\nof donning fancy dress, but the complete discomfiture of Pagett\r\nwas too tempting to be forborne.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I said. \u201cOf course I shall wear fancy dress.\r\nSo will you.\u201d\r\n\r\nPagett shuddered.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo go down to the barber\u2019s and see about it,\u201d I finished.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll have any out sizes,\u201d murmured Pagett, measuring\r\nmy figure with his eye.\r\n\r\nWithout meaning it, Pagett can occasionally be extremely offensive.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd order a table for six in the saloon,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the\r\nCaptain, the girl with the nice legs, Mrs. Blair\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t get Mrs. Blair without Colonel Race,\u201d Pagett interposed.\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s asked her to dine with him, I know.\u201d\r\n\r\nPagett always knows everything. I was justifiably annoyed.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho _is_ Race?\u201d I demanded, exasperated.\r\n\r\nAs I said before, Pagett always knows everything\u2014or thinks he does.\r\nHe looked mysterious again.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey say he\u2019s a Secret Service chap, Sir Eustace. Rather a great\r\ngun too. But of course I don\u2019t know for certain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that like the Government?\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cHere\u2019s a man on\r\nboard whose business it is to carry about secret documents, and\r\nthey go giving them to a peaceful outsider, who only asks to be\r\nlet alone.\u201d\r\n\r\nPagett looked even more mysterious. He came a pace nearer and\r\ndropped his voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you ask me, the whole thing is very queer, Sir Eustace. Look\r\nat that illness of mine before we started\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d I interrupted brutally, \u201cthat was a bilious\r\nattack. You\u2019re always having bilious attacks.\u201d\r\n\r\nPagett winced slightly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the usual sort of bilious attack. This time\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t go into the details of your condition,\r\nPagett. I don\u2019t want to hear them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, Sir Eustace. But my belief is that I was deliberately\r\n_poisoned!\u201d_\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been talking to Rayburn.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe did not deny it.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt any rate, Sir Eustace, _he_ thinks so\u2014and he should be in a\r\nposition to know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the way, where is the chap?\u201d I asked. \u201cI\u2019ve not set eyes on\r\nhim since we came on board.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe gives out that he\u2019s ill, and stays in his cabin, Sir Eustace.\u201d\r\nPagett\u2019s voice dropped again. \u201cBut that\u2019s _camouflage,_ I\u2019m sure.\r\nSo that he can watch better.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWatch?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOver your safety, Sir Eustace. In case an attack should be made\r\nupon you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a cheerful fellow, Pagett,\u201d I said. \u201cI trust that your\r\nimagination runs away with you. If I were you I should go to the\r\ndance as a death\u2019s head or an executioner. It will suit your\r\nmournful style of beauty.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat shut him up for the time being. I went on deck. The Beddingfeld\r\ngirl was deep in conversation with the missionary parson,\r\nChichester. Women always flutter round parsons.\r\n\r\nA man of my figure hates stooping, but I had the courtesy to pick\r\nup a bit of paper that was fluttering round the parson\u2019s feet.\r\n\r\nI got no word of thanks for my pains. As a matter of fact, I\r\ncouldn\u2019t help seeing what was written on the sheet of paper. There\r\nwas just one sentence:\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to play a lone hand or it will be the worse for you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s a nice thing for a parson to have. Who is this fellow\r\nChichester, I wonder? He _looks_ mild as milk. But looks are\r\ndeceptive. I shall ask Pagett about him. Pagett always knows\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nI sank gracefully into my deck-chair by the side of Mrs. Blair,\r\nthereby interrupting her _t\u00e8te-\u00e0-t\u00eate_ with Race, and remarked that\r\nI didn\u2019t know what the clergy were coming to nowadays.\r\n\r\nThen I asked her to dine with me on the night of the Fancy Dress\r\ndance. Somehow or other Race managed to get included in the\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch the Beddingfeld girl came and sat with us for coffee.\r\nI was right about her legs. They _are_ the best on the ship. I\r\nshall certainly ask her to dinner as well.\r\n\r\nI would very much like to know what mischief Pagett was up to in\r\nFlorence. Whenever Italy is mentioned, he goes to pieces. If I did\r\nnot know how intensely respectable he is\u2014I should suspect him of\r\nsome disreputable _amour_ . . .\r\n\r\nI wonder now! Even the most respectable men\u2014\u2014It would cheer me up\r\nenormously if it was so.\r\n\r\nPagett\u2014with a guilty secret! Splendid!\r\n\nIt has been a curious evening.\r\n\r\nThe only costume that fitted me in the barber\u2019s emporium was that\r\nof a Teddy Bear. I don\u2019t mind playing bears with some nice young\r\ngirls on a winter\u2019s evening in England\u2014but it\u2019s hardly an ideal\r\ncostume for the equator. However, I created a good deal of\r\nmerriment, and won first prize for \u201cbrought on board\u201d\u2014an absurd\r\nterm for a costume hired for the evening. Still as nobody seemed\r\nto have the least idea whether they were made or brought, it didn\u2019t\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nMrs. Blair refused to dress up. Apparently she is at one with\r\nPagett on the matter. Colonel Race followed her example. Anne\r\nBeddingfeld had concocted a gipsy costume for herself, and looked\r\nextraordinarily well. Pagett said he had a headache and didn\u2019t\r\nappear. To replace him I asked a quaint little fellow called\r\nReeves. He\u2019s a prominent member of the South African Labour party.\r\nHorrible little man, but I want to keep in with him, as he gives\r\nme information that I need. I want to understand this Rand business\r\nfrom both sides.\r\n\r\nDancing was a hot affair. I danced twice with Anne Beddingfeld and\r\nshe had to pretend she liked it. I danced once with Mrs. Blair,\r\nwho didn\u2019t trouble to pretend, and I victimized various other\r\ndamsels whose appearance struck me favourably.\r\n\r\nThen we went down to supper. I had ordered champagne; the steward\r\nsuggested Clicquot 1911 as being the best they had on the boat and\r\nI fell in with his suggestion. I seemed to have hit on the one\r\nthing that would loosen Colonel Race\u2019s tongue. Far from being\r\ntaciturn, the man became actually talkative. For a while this\r\namused me, then it occurred to me that Colonel Race, and not\r\nmyself, was becoming the life and soul of the party. He chaffed me\r\nat length about keeping a diary.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will reveal all your indiscretions one of these days, Pedler.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Race,\u201d I said, \u201cI venture to suggest that I am not quite\r\nthe fool you think me. I may commit indiscretions, but I don\u2019t\r\nwrite them down in black and white. After my death, my executors\r\nwill know my opinion of a great many people, but I doubt if they\r\nwill find anything to add or detract from their opinion of _me._\r\nA diary is useful for recording the idiosyncrasies of other\r\npeople\u2014but not one\u2019s own.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is such a thing as unconscious self-revelation, though.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the eyes of the psycho-analyst, all things are vile,\u201d I replied\r\nsententiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must have had a very interesting life, Colonel Race?\u201d said\r\nMiss Beddingfeld, gazing at him with wide, starry eyes.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s how they do it, these girls! Othello charmed Desdemona by\r\ntelling her stories, but, oh, didn\u2019t Desdemona charm Othello by\r\nthe way she listened?\r\n\r\nAnyway, the girl set Race off all right. He began to tell lion\r\nstories. A man who has shot lions in large quantities has an unfair\r\nadvantage over other men. It seemed to me that it was time I, too,\r\ntold a lion story. One of a more sprightly character.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d I remarked, \u201cthat reminds me of a rather exciting\r\ntale I heard. A friend of mine was out on a shooting trip somewhere\r\nin East Africa. One night he came out of his tent for some reason,\r\nand was startled by a low growl. He turned sharply and saw a lion\r\ncrouching to spring. He had left his rifle in the tent. Quick as\r\nthought, he ducked, and the lion sprang right over his head.\r\nAnnoyed at having missed him, the animal growled and prepared to\r\nspring again. Again he ducked, and again the lion sprang right over\r\nhim. This happened a third time, but by now he was close to the\r\nentrance of the tent, and he darted in and seized his rifle. When\r\nhe emerged, rifle in hand, the lion had disappeared. That puzzled\r\nhim greatly. He crept round the back of the tent, where there was\r\na little clearing. There, sure enough, was the lion, busily\r\npractising low jumps.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was received with a roar of applause. I drank some champagne.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn another occasion,\u201d I remarked, \u201cthis friend of mine had a\r\nsecond curious experience. He was trekking across country, and\r\nbeing anxious to arrive at his destination before the heat of the\r\nday he ordered his boys to inspan whilst it was still dark. They\r\nhad some trouble in doing so, as the mules were very restive, but\r\nat last they managed it, and a start was made. The mules raced\r\nalong like the wind, and when daylight came they saw why. In the\r\ndarkness, the boys had inspanned a lion as the near wheeler.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis, too, was well received, a ripple of merriment going round\r\nthe table, but I am not sure that the greatest tribute did not come\r\nfrom my friend, the Labour Member, who remained pale and serious.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God!\u201d he said anxiously. \u201cWho un\u2019arnessed them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI must go to Rhodesia,\u201d said Mrs. Blair. \u201cAfter what you have told\r\nus, Colonel Race, I simply must. It\u2019s a horrible journey though,\r\nfive days in the train.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must join me on my private car,\u201d I said gallantly. \u201cOh, Sir\r\nEustace, how sweet of you, do you really mean it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo I mean it!\u201d I exclaimed reproachfully, and drank another glass\r\nof champagne.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust about another week, and we shall be in South Africa,\u201d sighed\r\nMrs. Blair.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, South Africa,\u201d I said sentimentally, and began to quote from\r\na recent speech of mine at the Colonial Institute. \u201cWhat has South\r\nAfrica to show the world? What indeed? Her fruit and her farms,\r\nher wool and her wattles, her herds and her hides, her gold and\r\nher diamonds\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nI was hurrying on, because I knew that as soon as I paused Reeves\r\nwould butt in and inform me that the hides were worthless because\r\nthe animals hung themselves up on barbed wire or something of that\r\nsort, would crab everything else, and end up with the hardships of\r\nthe miners on the Rand. And I was not in the mood to be abused as\r\na Capitalist. However, the interruption came from another source\r\nat the magic word diamonds.\r\n\r\n\u201cDiamonds!\u201d said Mrs. Blair ecstatically.\r\n\r\n\u201cDiamonds!\u201d breathed Miss Beddingfeld.\r\n\r\nThey both addressed Colonel Race.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019ve been to Kimberley?\u201d\r\n\r\nI had been to Kimberley too, but I didn\u2019t manage to say so in time.\r\nRace was being inundated with questions. What were mines like? Was\r\nit true that the natives were kept shut up in compounds? And so\r\non.\r\n\r\nRace answered their questions and showed a good knowledge of his\r\nsubject. He described the methods of housing the natives, the\r\nsearches instituted, and the various precautions that De Beers\r\ntook.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen it\u2019s practically impossible to steal any diamonds?\u201d asked\r\nMrs. Blair with as keen an air of disappointment as though she had\r\nbeen journeying there for the express purpose.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing\u2019s impossible, Mrs. Blair. Thefts do occur\u2014like the case\r\nI told you of where the Kafir hid the stone in his wound.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but on a large scale?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnce, in recent years. Just before the War in fact. You must\r\nremember the case, Pedler. You were in South Africa at the time?\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cTell us,\u201d cried Miss Beddingfeld. \u201cOh, do tell us!\u201d\r\n\r\nRace smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, you shall have the story. I suppose most of you have\r\nheard of Sir Laurence Eardsley, the great South African mining\r\nmagnate? His mines were gold mines, but he comes into the story\r\nthrough his son. You may remember that just before the War rumours\r\nwere afield of a new potential Kimberley hidden somewhere in the\r\nrocky floor of the British Guiana jungles. Two young explorers, so\r\nit was reported, had returned from that part of South America\r\nbringing with them a remarkable collection of rough diamonds, some\r\nof them of considerable size. Diamonds of small size had been found\r\nbefore in the neighbourhood of the Essequibo and Mazaruni rivers,\r\nbut these two young men, John Eardsley and his friend Lucas,\r\nclaimed to have discovered beds of great carbon deposits at the\r\ncommon head of two streams. The diamonds were of every colour,\r\npink, blue, yellow, green, black, and the purest white. Eardsley\r\nand Lucas came to Kimberley where they were to submit their gems\r\nto inspection. At the same time a sensational robbery was found to\r\nhave taken place at De Beers. When sending diamonds to England they\r\nare made up into a packet. This remains in the big safe, of which\r\nthe two keys are held by two different men whilst a third man knows\r\nthe combination. They are handed to the Bank, and the Bank send\r\nthem to England. Each package is worth, roughly, about \u00a3100,000.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn this occasion, the Bank were struck by something a little\r\nunusual about the sealing of the packet. It was opened, and found\r\nto contain knobs of sugar!\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly how suspicion came to fasten on John Eardsley I do not\r\nknow. It was remembered that he had been very wild at Cambridge\r\nand that his father had paid his debts more than once. Anyhow, it\r\nsoon got about that this story of South American diamond fields\r\nwas all a fantasy. John Eardsley was arrested. In his possession\r\nwas found a portion of the De Beer diamonds.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the case never came to court. Sir Laurence Eardsley paid over\r\na sum equal to the missing diamonds and De Beers did not prosecute.\r\nExactly how the robbery was committed has never been known. But\r\nthe knowledge that his son was a thief broke the old man\u2019s heart.\r\nHe had a stroke shortly afterwards. As for John, his Fate was in\r\na way merciful. He enlisted, went to the War, fought there bravely,\r\nand was killed, thus wiping out the stain on his name. Sir Laurence\r\nhimself had a third stroke and died about a month ago. He died\r\nintestate and his vast fortune passed to his next of kin, a man\r\nwhom he hardly knew.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel paused. A babel of ejaculations and questions broke\r\nout. Something seemed to attract Miss Beddingfeld\u2019s attention, and\r\nshe turned in her chair. At the little gasp she gave, I, too,\r\nturned.\r\n\r\nMy new secretary, Rayburn, was standing in the doorway. Under his\r\ntan, his face had the pallor of one who has seen a ghost. Evidently\r\nRace\u2019s story had moved him profoundly.\r\n\r\nSuddenly conscious of our scrutiny, he turned abruptly and\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know who that is?\u201d asked Anne Beddingfeld abruptly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my other secretary,\u201d I explained. \u201cMr. Rayburn. He\u2019s been\r\nseedy up to now.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe toyed with the bread by her plate.\r\n\r\n\u201cHas he been your secretary long?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot very long,\u201d I said cautiously.\r\n\r\nBut caution is useless with a woman, the more you hold back, the\r\nmore she presses forward. Anne Beddingfeld made no bones about it.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long?\u201d she asked bluntly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell\u2014er\u2014I engaged him just before I sailed. Old friend of mine\r\nrecommended him.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe said nothing more, but relapsed into a thoughtful silence. I\r\nturned to Race with the feeling that it was my turn to display an\r\ninterest in his story.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho is Sir Laurence\u2019s next of kin, Race? Do you know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should say so,\u201d he replied, with a smile. \u201cI am!\u201d\r\n\n_(Anne\u2019s Narrative Resumed)_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on the night of the Fancy Dress dance that I decided that\r\nthe time had come for me to confide in some one. So far I had\r\nplayed a lone hand and rather enjoyed it. Now suddenly everything\r\nwas changed. I distrusted my own judgment and for the first time\r\na feeling of loneliness and desolation crept over me.\r\n\r\nI sat on the edge of my bunk, still in my gipsy dress, and\r\nconsidered the situation. I thought first of Colonel Race. He had\r\nseemed to like me. He would be kind, I was sure. And he was no\r\nfool. Yet, as I thought it over, I wavered. He was a man of\r\ncommanding personality. He would take the whole matter out of my\r\nhands. And it was _my_ mystery! There were other reasons, too,\r\nwhich I would hardly acknowledge to myself, but which made it\r\ninadvisable to confide in Colonel Race.\r\n\r\nThen I thought of Mrs. Blair. She, too, had been kind to me. I did\r\nnot delude myself into the belief that that really meant anything.\r\nIt was probably a mere whim of the moment. All the same, I had it\r\nin my power to interest her. She was a woman who had experienced\r\nmost of the ordinary sensations of life. I proposed to supply her\r\nwith an extraordinary one! And I liked her; liked her ease of\r\nmanner, her lack of sentimentality, her freedom from any form of\r\naffectation.\r\n\r\nMy mind was made up. I decided to seek her out then and there. She\r\nwould hardly be in bed yet.\r\n\r\nThen I remembered that I did not know the number of her cabin. My\r\nfriend, the night stewardess, would probably know. I rang the bell.\r\nAfter some delay it was answered by a man. He gave me the\r\ninformation I wanted. Mrs. Blair\u2019s cabin was No. 71. He apologized\r\nfor the delay in answering the bell, but explained that he had all\r\nthe cabins to attend to.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is the stewardess, then?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey all go off duty at ten o\u2019clock.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014I mean the night stewardess.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo stewardess on at night, miss.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut\u2014but a stewardess came the other night\u2014about one o\u2019clock.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must have been dreaming, miss. There\u2019s no stewardess on duty\r\nafter ten.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe withdrew and I was left to digest this morsel of information.\r\nWho was the woman who had come to my cabin on the night of the\r\n22nd? My face grew graver as I realized the cunning and audacity\r\nof my unknown antagonists. Then, pulling myself together, I left\r\nmy own cabin and sought that of Mrs. Blair. I knocked at the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d called her voice from within.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s me\u2014Anne Beddingfeld.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, come in, Gipsy girl.\u201d\r\n\r\nI entered. A good deal of scattered clothing lay about, and Mrs.\r\nBlair herself was draped in one of the loveliest kimonos I had ever\r\nseen. It was all orange and gold and black and made my mouth water\r\nto look at it.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Blair,\u201d I said abruptly, \u201cI want to tell you the story of my\r\nlife\u2014that is, if it isn\u2019t too late, and you won\u2019t be bored.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit. I always hate going to bed,\u201d said Mrs. Blair, her face\r\ncrinkling into smiles in the delightful way it had. \u201cAnd I should\r\nlove to hear the story of your life. You\u2019re a most unusual creature,\r\nGipsy girl. Nobody else would think of bursting in on me at 1 a.m.\r\nto tell me the story of their life. Especially after snubbing my\r\nnatural curiosity for weeks as you have done! I\u2019m not accustomed\r\nto being snubbed. It\u2019s been quite a pleasing novelty. Sit down on\r\nthe sofa and unburden your soul.\u201d\r\n\r\nI told her the whole story. It took some time as I was conscientious\r\nover all the details. She gave a deep sigh when I had finished,\r\nbut she did not say at all what I had expected her to say. Instead\r\nshe looked at me, laughed a little and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know, Anne, you\u2019re a very unusual girl? Haven\u2019t you ever\r\nhad qualms?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQualms?\u201d I asked, puzzled.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, qualms, qualms, qualms! Starting off alone with practically\r\nno money. What will you do when you find yourself in a strange\r\ncountry with all your money gone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no good bothering about that until it comes. I\u2019ve got plenty\r\nof money still. The twenty-five pounds that Mrs. Flemming gave me\r\nis practically intact, and then I won the sweep yesterday. That\u2019s\r\nanother fifteen pounds. Why, I\u2019ve got _lots_ of money. Forty\r\npounds!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLots of money! My God!\u201d murmured Mrs. Blair. _\u201cI_ couldn\u2019t do it,\r\nAnne, and I\u2019ve plenty of pluck in my own way. I couldn\u2019t start off\r\ngaily with a few pounds in my pocket and no idea as to what I was\r\ndoing and where I was going.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s the fun of it,\u201d I cried, thoroughly roused. \u201cIt gives\r\none such a splendid feeling of adventure.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe looked at me, nodded once or twice, and then smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cLucky Anne! There aren\u2019t many people in the world who feel as you\r\ndo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said impatiently, \u201cwhat do you think of it all, Mrs.\r\nBlair?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the most thrilling thing I ever heard! Now, to begin\r\nwith, you will stop calling me Mrs. Blair. Suzanne will be ever so\r\nmuch better. Is that agreed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should love it, Suzanne.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood girl. Now let\u2019s get down to business. You say that in Sir\r\nEustace\u2019s secretary\u2014not that long-faced Pagett, the other one\u2014you\r\nrecognized the man who was stabbed and came into your cabin for\r\nshelter?\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat gives us two links connecting Sir Eustace with the tangle.\r\nThe woman was murdered in _his_ house, and it\u2019s _his_ secretary\r\nwho gets stabbed at the mystic hour of one o\u2019clock. I don\u2019t suspect\r\nSir Eustace himself, but it can\u2019t be all coincidence. There\u2019s a\r\nconnection somewhere even if he himself is unaware of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen there\u2019s the queer business of the stewardess,\u201d she continued\r\nthoughtfully. \u201cWhat was she like?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hardly noticed her. I was so excited and strung up\u2014and a\r\nstewardess seemed such an anticlimax. But\u2014yes\u2014I did think her face\r\nwas familiar. Of course it would be if I\u2019d seen her about the\r\nship.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHer face seemed familiar to you,\u201d said Suzanne. \u201cSure she wasn\u2019t\r\na man?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was very tall,\u201d I admitted.\r\n\r\n\u201cHum. Hardly Sir Eustace, I should think, nor Mr. Pagett\u2014\u2014Wait!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe caught up a scrap of paper and began drawing feverishly. She\r\ninspected the result with her head poised on one side.\r\n\r\n\u201cA very good likeness of the Rev. Edward Chichester. Now for the\r\netceteras.\u201d She passed the paper over to me. \u201cIs that your\r\nstewardess?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, yes,\u201d I cried. \u201cSuzanne, how clever of you!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe disdained the compliment with a light gesture.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had suspicions of that Chichester creature. Do you\r\nremember how he dropped his coffee-cup and turned a sickly green\r\nwhen we were discussing Crippen the other day?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd he tried to get Cabin 17!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it all fits in so far. But what does it all _mean?_ What was\r\nreally meant to happen at one o\u2019clock in Cabin 17? It can\u2019t be the\r\nstabbing of the secretary. There would be no point in timing that\r\nfor a special hour on a special day in a special place. No, it must\r\nhave been some kind of appointment and he was on his way to keep\r\nit when they knifed him. But who was the appointment with? Certainly\r\nnot with you. It might have been with Chichester. Or it might have\r\nbeen with Pagett.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat seems unlikely,\u201d I objected, \u201cthey can see each other any\r\ntime.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe both sat silent for a minute or two, then Suzanne started off\r\non another tack.\r\n\r\n\u201cCould there have been anything hidden in the cabin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat seems more probable,\u201d I agreed. \u201cIt would explain my things\r\nbeing ransacked the next morning. But there was nothing hidden\r\nthere, I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe young man couldn\u2019t have slipped something into a drawer the\r\nnight before?\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should have seen him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCould it have been your precious piece of paper they were looking\r\nfor?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt might have been, but it seems rather senseless. It was only a\r\ntime and a date\u2014and they were both past by then.\u201d\r\n\r\nSuzanne nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so of course. No, it wasn\u2019t the paper. By the way, have\r\nyou got it with you? I\u2019d rather like to see it.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had brought the paper with me as Exhibit A, and I handed it over\r\nto her. She scrutinized it, frowning.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a dot after the 17. Why isn\u2019t there a dot after the 1\r\ntoo?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a space,\u201d I pointed out.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, there\u2019s a space, but\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nSuddenly she rose and peered at the paper, holding it as close\r\nunder the light as possible. There was a repressed excitement in\r\nher manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnne, that isn\u2019t a dot! That\u2019s a flaw in the paper! A flaw in the\r\npaper, you see? So you\u2019ve got to ignore it, and just go by the\r\nspaces\u2014the spaces!\u201d\r\n\r\nI had risen and was standing by her. I read out the figures as I\r\nnow saw them.\r\n\r\n\u201c1 71 22.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d said Suzanne, \u201cit\u2019s the same, but not quite. It\u2019s one\r\no\u2019clock still, and the 22nd\u2014but it\u2019s Cabin 71! _My_ cabin, Anne!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe stood staring at each other, so pleased with our new discovery\r\nand so rapt with excitement that you might have thought we had\r\nsolved the whole mystery. Then I fell to earth with a bump.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, Suzanne, nothing happened here at one o\u2019clock on the 22nd?\u201d\r\n\r\nHer face fell also. \u201cNo\u2014it didn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother idea struck me.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t your own cabin, is it, Suzanne? I mean not the one you\r\noriginally booked?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, the purser changed me into it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder if it was booked before sailing for some one\u2014some one\r\nwho didn\u2019t turn up. I suppose we could find out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to find out, Gipsy girl,\u201d cried Suzanne. \u201cI know!\r\nThe purser was telling me about it. The cabin was booked in the\r\nname of Mrs. Grey\u2014but it seems that Mrs. Grey was merely a pseudonym\r\nfor the famous Madame Nadina. She\u2019s a celebrated Russian dancer,\r\nyou know. She\u2019s never appeared in London, but Paris has been quite\r\nmad about her. She had a terrific success there all through the\r\nWar. A thoroughly bad lot, I believe, but most attractive. The\r\npurser expressed his regrets that she wasn\u2019t on board in a most\r\nheart-felt fashion when he gave me her cabin, and then Colonel Race\r\ntold me a lot about her. It seems there were very queer stories\r\nafloat in Paris. She was suspected of espionage, but they couldn\u2019t\r\nprove anything. I rather fancy Colonel Race was over there simply\r\non that account. He\u2019s told me some very interesting things. There\r\nwas a regular organized gang, not German in origin at all. In fact\r\nthe head of it, a man always referred to as \u2018the Colonel\u2019 was\r\nthought to be an Englishman, but they never got any clue as to his\r\nidentity. But there is no doubt that he controlled a considerable\r\norganization of international crooks. Robberies, espionages,\r\nassaults, he undertook them all\u2014and usually provided an innocent\r\nscapegoat to pay the penalty. Diabolically clever, he must have\r\nbeen! This woman was supposed to be one of his agents, but they\r\ncouldn\u2019t get hold of anything to go upon. Yes, Anne, we\u2019re on the\r\nright tack. Nadina is just the woman to be mixed up in this\r\nbusiness. The appointment on the morning of the 22nd was with her\r\nin this cabin. But where is she? Why didn\u2019t she sail?\u201d\r\n\r\nA light flashed upon me.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe meant to sail,\u201d I said slowly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen why didn\u2019t she?\u201d\r\n\r\n_\u201cBecause she was dead._ Suzanne, Nadina was the woman murdered at\r\nMarlow!\u201d\r\n\r\nMy mind went back to the bare room in the empty house, and there\r\nswept over me again that indefinable sensation of menace and evil.\r\nWith it came the memory of the falling pencil and the discovery of\r\nthe roll of films. A roll of films\u2014that struck a more recent note.\r\nWhere had I heard of a roll of films? And why did I connect that\r\nthought with Mrs. Blair?\r\n\r\nSuddenly I flew at her and almost shook her in my excitement.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour films! The ones that were passed to you through the\r\nventilator? Wasn\u2019t that on the 22nd?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe ones I lost?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you know they were the same? Why would any one return them\r\nto you that way\u2014in the middle of the night? It\u2019s a mad idea.\r\nNo\u2014they were a message, the films had been taken out of the yellow\r\ntin case, and something else put inside. Have you got it still?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI may have used it. No, here it is. I remember I tossed it into\r\nthe rack at the side of the bunk.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe held it out to me.\r\n\r\nIt was an ordinary round tin cylinder, such as films are packed in\r\nfor the tropics. I took it with trembling hand, but even as I did\r\nso my heart leapt. It was noticeably heavier than it should have\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nWith shaking fingers I peeled off the strip of adhesive plaster\r\nthat kept it air-tight. I pulled off the lid, and a stream of dull\r\nglassy pebbles rolled onto the bed.\r\n\r\n\u201cPebbles,\u201d I said, keenly disappointed.\r\n\r\n\u201cPebbles?\u201d cried Suzanne.\r\n\r\nThe ring in her voice excited me.\r\n\r\n\u201cPebbles? No, Anne, not pebbles! _Diamonds!\u201d_\r\n\nDiamonds!\r\n\r\nI stared, fascinated, at the glassy heap on the bunk. I picked up\r\none which, but for the weight, might have been a fragment of broken\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you sure, Suzanne?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, my dear. I\u2019ve seen rough diamonds too often to have any\r\ndoubts. They\u2019re beauties too, Anne\u2014and some of them are unique, I\r\nshould say. There\u2019s a history behind these.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe history we heard to-night,\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean\u2014\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cColonel Race\u2019s story. It can\u2019t be a coincidence. He told it for\r\na purpose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo see its effect, you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cIts effect on Sir Eustace?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut, even as I said it, a doubt assailed me. _Was_ it Sir Eustace\r\nwho had been subjected to a test, or had the story been told for\r\n_my_ benefit? I remembered the impression I had received on that\r\nformer night of having been deliberately \u201cpumped.\u201d For some reason\r\nor other, Colonel Race was suspicious. But where did he come in?\r\nWhat possible connection could he have with the affair?\r\n\r\n\u201cWho _is_ Colonel Race?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s rather a question,\u201d said Suzanne. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty well known\r\nas a big-game hunter, and, as you heard him say to-night, he was\r\na distant cousin of Sir Laurence Eardsley. I\u2019ve never actually met\r\nhim until this trip. He journeys to and from Africa a good deal.\r\nThere\u2019s a general idea that he does Secret Service work. I don\u2019t\r\nknow whether it\u2019s true or not. He\u2019s certainly rather a mysterious\r\ncreature.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose he came into a lot of money as Sir Laurence Eardsley\u2019s\r\nheir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Anne, he must be _rolling._ You know, he\u2019d be a splendid\r\nmatch for you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t have a good go at him with you aboard the ship,\u201d I said,\r\nlaughing. \u201cOh, these married women!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe do have a pull,\u201d murmured Suzanne complacently. \u201cAnd everybody\r\nknows that I am absolutely devoted to Clarence\u2014my husband, you\r\nknow. It\u2019s so safe and pleasant to make love to a devoted wife.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must be very nice for Clarence to be married to some one like\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m wearing to live with! Still, he can always escape to\r\nthe Foreign Office, where he fixes his eyeglass in his eye, and\r\ngoes to sleep in a big arm-chair. We might cable him to tell us\r\nall he knows about Race. I love sending cables. And they annoy\r\nClarence so. He always says a letter would have done as well. I\r\ndon\u2019t suppose he\u2019d tell us anything, though. He is so frightfully\r\ndiscreet. That\u2019s what makes him so hard to live with for long on\r\nend. But let us go on with our matchmaking. I\u2019m sure Colonel Race\r\nis very attracted to you, Anne. Give him a couple of glances from\r\nthose wicked eyes of yours, and the deed is done. Every one gets\r\nengaged on board ship. There\u2019s nothing else to do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get married.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d said Suzanne. \u201cWhy not? I love being married\u2014even to\r\nClarence!\u201d\r\n\r\nI disdained her flippancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I want to know is,\u201d I said with determination, \u201cwhat has\r\nColonel Race got to do with this? He\u2019s in it somewhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think it was mere chance, his telling that story?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d I said decidedly. \u201cHe was watching us all narrowly.\r\nYou remember, _some_ of the diamonds were recovered, not all.\r\nPerhaps these are the missing ones\u2014or perhaps\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps what?\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not answer directly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like to know,\u201d I said, \u201cwhat became of the other young\r\nman. Not Eardsley but\u2014what was his name?\u2014Lucas!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting some light on the thing, anyway. It\u2019s the diamonds\r\nall these people are after. It must have been to obtain possession\r\nof the diamonds that \u2018The Man in the Brown Suit\u2019 killed Nadina.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t kill her,\u201d I said sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course he killed her. Who else could have done so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t kill her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe went into that house three minutes after her and came out as\r\nwhite as a sheet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause he found her dead.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut nobody else went in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen the murderer was in the house already, or else he got in some\r\nother way. There\u2019s no need for him to pass the lodge, he could have\r\nclimbed over the wall.\u201d\r\n\r\nSuzanne glanced at me sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The Man in the Brown Suit,\u2019\u201d she mused. \u201cWho was he, I wonder?\r\nAnyway, he was identical with the \u2018doctor\u2019 in the Tube. He would\r\nhave had time to remove his make-up and follow the woman to Marlow.\r\nShe and Carton were to have met there, they both had an order to\r\nview the same house, and if they took such elaborate precautions\r\nto make their meeting appear accidental they must have suspected\r\nthey were being followed. All the same, Carton did _not_ know that\r\nhis shadower was the \u2018Man in the Brown Suit.\u2019 When he recognized\r\nhim, the shock was so great that he lost his head completely and\r\nstepped back onto the line. That all seems pretty clear, don\u2019t you\r\nthink so, Anne?\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not reply.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s how it was. He took the paper from the dead man, and\r\nin his hurry to get away he dropped it. Then he followed the woman\r\nto Marlow. What did he do when he left there, when he had killed\r\nher\u2014or, according to you, found her dead. Where did he go?\u201d\r\n\r\nStill I said nothing.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder, now,\u201d said Suzanne musingly. \u201cIs it possible that he\r\ninduced Sir Eustace Pedler to bring him on board as his secretary?\r\nIt would be a unique chance of getting safely out of England, and\r\ndodging the hue and cry. But how did he square Sir Eustace? It\r\nlooks as though he had some hold over him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOr over Pagett,\u201d I suggested in spite of myself.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to like Pagett, Anne. Sir Eustace says he\u2019s a most\r\ncapable and hard-working young man. And, really, he may be for all\r\nwe know against him. Well, to continue my surmises. Rayburn is the\r\n\u2018Man in the Brown Suit.\u2019 He had read the paper he dropped.\r\nTherefore, misled by the dot as you were, he attempts to reach\r\nCabin 17 at one o\u2019clock on the 22nd, having previously tried to\r\nget possession of the cabin through Pagett. On the way there\r\nsomebody knifes him\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d I interpolated.\r\n\r\n\u201cChichester. Yes, it all fits in. Cable to Lord Nasby that you have\r\nfound \u2018The Man in the Brown Suit,\u2019 and your fortune\u2019s made, Anne!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are several things you\u2019ve overlooked.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat things? Rayburn\u2019s got a scar, I know\u2014but a scar can be faked\r\neasily enough. He\u2019s the right height and build. What\u2019s the\r\ndescription of a head with which you pulverized them at Scotland\r\nYard?\u201d\r\n\r\nI trembled. Suzanne was a well-educated, well-read woman, but I\r\nprayed that she might not be conversant with technical terms of\r\nanthropology.\r\n\r\n\u201cDolichocephalic,\u201d I said lightly.\r\n\r\nSuzanne looked doubtful.\r\n\r\n\u201cWas that it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Long-headed, you know. A head whose width is less than 75\r\nper cent. of its length,\u201d I explained fluently.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. I was just beginning to breathe freely when\r\nSuzanne said suddenly:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the opposite?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u2014the opposite?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there must be an opposite. What do you call the heads whose\r\nbreadth is more than 75 per cent. of their length.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBrachycephalic,\u201d I murmured unwillingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it. I thought that was what you said.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid I? It was a slip of the tongue. I meant dolichocephalic,\u201d I\r\nsaid with all the assurance I could muster.\r\n\r\nSuzanne looked at me searchingly.  Then she laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou lie very well, Gipsy girl. But it will save time and trouble\r\nnow if you tell me all about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to tell,\u201d I said unwillingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there?\u201d said Suzanne gently.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose I shall have to tell you,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cI\u2019m not\r\nashamed of it. You can\u2019t be ashamed of something that just\u2014happens\r\nto you. That\u2019s what he did. He was detestable\u2014rude and ungrateful\u2014but\r\nthat I think I understand. It\u2019s like a dog that\u2019s been chained\r\nup\u2014or badly treated\u2014it\u2019ll bite anybody. That\u2019s what he was\r\nlike\u2014bitter and snarling. I don\u2019t know why I care\u2014but I do. I care\r\nhorribly. Just seeing him has turned my whole life upside-down. I\r\nlove him. I want him. I\u2019ll walk all over Africa barefoot till I\r\nfind him, and I\u2019ll make him care for me. I\u2019d die for him. I\u2019d work\r\nfor him, slave for him, steal for him, even beg or borrow for him!\r\nThere\u2014now you know!\u201d\r\n\r\nSuzanne looked at me for a long time.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re very un-English, Gipsy girl,\u201d she said at last. \u201cThere\u2019s\r\nnot a scrap of the sentimental about you. I\u2019ve never met any one\r\nwho was at once so practical and so passionate. I shall never care\r\nfor any one like that\u2014mercifully for me\u2014and yet\u2014and yet I envy you,\r\nGipsy girl. It\u2019s something to be able to care. Most people can\u2019t.\r\nBut what a mercy for your little doctor man that you didn\u2019t marry\r\nhim. He doesn\u2019t sound at all the sort of individual who would enjoy\r\nkeeping high explosive in the house! So there\u2019s to be no cabling\r\nto Lord Nasby?\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet you believe him to be innocent?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI also believe that innocent people can be hanged.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHm! yes. But, Anne dear, you can face facts, face them now. In\r\nspite of all you say, he may have murdered this woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s sentiment.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t. He might have killed her. He may even have followed\r\nher there with that idea in his mind. But he wouldn\u2019t take a bit\r\nof black cord and strangle her with it. If he\u2019d done it, he would\r\nhave strangled her with his bare hands.\u201d\r\n\r\nSuzanne gave a little shiver. Her eyes narrowed appreciatively.\r\n\r\n\u201cHm! Anne, I am beginning to see why you find this young man of\r\nyours so attractive!\u201d\r\n\nI got an opportunity of tackling Colonel Race on the following\r\nmorning. The auction of the sweep had just been concluded, and we\r\nwalked up and down the deck together.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s the gipsy this morning? Longing for land and her caravan?\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow that the sea is behaving so nicely, I feel I should like to\r\nstay on it for ever and ever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat enthusiasm!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, isn\u2019t it lovely this morning?\u201d\r\n\r\nWe leant together over the rail. It was a glassy calm. The sea\r\nlooked as though it had been oiled. There were great patches of\r\ncolour on it, blue, pale green, emerald, purple and deep orange,\r\nlike a cubist picture. There was an occasional flash of silver that\r\nshowed the flying fish. The air was moist and warm, almost sticky.\r\nIts breath was like a perfumed caress.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was a very interesting story you told us last night,\u201d I said,\r\nbreaking the silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich one?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe one about the diamonds.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe women are always interested in diamonds.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course we are. By the way, what became of the other young man?\r\nYou said there were two of them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYoung Lucas? Well, of course, they couldn\u2019t prosecute one without\r\nthe other, so he went scot-free too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what happened to him\u2014eventually, I mean. Does any one know?\u201d\r\n\r\nColonel Race was looking straight ahead of him out to sea. His face\r\nwas as devoid of expression as a mask, but I had an idea that he\r\ndid not like my questions. Nevertheless, he replied readily enough:\r\n\r\n\u201cHe went to the War and acquitted himself bravely. He was reported\r\nMissing and Wounded\u2014believed killed.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat told me what I wanted to know. I asked no more. But more than\r\never I wondered how much Colonel Race knew. The part he was playing\r\nin all this puzzled me.\r\n\r\nOne other thing I did. That was to interview the night steward.\r\nWith a little financial encouragement, I soon got him to talk.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe lady wasn\u2019t frightened, was she, miss? It seemed a harmless\r\nsort of joke. A bet, or so I understood.\u201d\r\n\r\nI got it all out of him, little by little. On the voyage from Cape\r\nTown to England one of the passengers had handed him a roll of\r\nfilms with instructions that they were to be dropped onto the bunk\r\nin Cabin 71 at 1 a.m. on January 22nd on the outward journey. A\r\nlady would be occupying the cabin, and the affair was described as\r\na bet. I gathered that the steward had been liberally paid for his\r\npart in the transaction. The lady\u2019s name had not been mentioned.\r\nOf course, as Mrs. Blair went straight into Cabin 71, interviewing\r\nthe purser as soon as she got on board, it never occurred to the\r\nsteward that she was not the lady in question. The name of the\r\npassenger who had arranged the transaction was Carton, and his\r\ndescription tallied exactly with that of the man killed on the\r\nTube.\r\n\r\nSo one mystery, at all events, was cleared up, and the diamonds\r\nwere obviously the key to the whole situation.\r\n\r\nThose last days on the _Kilmorden_ seemed to pass very quickly. As\r\nwe drew nearer and nearer to Cape Town, I was forced to consider\r\ncarefully my future plans. There were so many people I wanted to\r\nkeep an eye on. Mr. Chichester, Sir Eustace and his secretary,\r\nand\u2014yes, Colonel Race! What was I to do about it? Naturally it was\r\nChichester who had first claim on my attention. Indeed, I was on\r\nthe point of reluctantly dismissing Sir Eustace and Mr. Pagett from\r\ntheir position of suspicious characters, when a chance conversation\r\nawakened fresh doubts in my mind.\r\n\r\nI had not forgotten Mr. Pagett\u2019s incomprehensible emotion at the\r\nmention of Florence. On the last evening on board we were all\r\nsitting on deck and Sir Eustace addressed a perfectly innocent\r\nquestion to his secretary. I forget exactly what it was, something\r\nto do with railway delays in Italy, but at once I noticed that Mr.\r\nPagett was displaying the same uneasiness which had caught my\r\nattention before. When Sir Eustace claimed Mrs. Blair for a dance,\r\nI quickly moved into the chair next to the secretary. I was\r\ndetermined to get to the bottom of the matter.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have always longed to go to Italy,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd especially to\r\nFlorence. Didn\u2019t you enjoy it very much there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed I did, Miss Beddingfeld. If you will excuse me, there is\r\nsome correspondence of Sir Eustace\u2019s that\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nI took hold of him firmly by his coat sleeve.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you mustn\u2019t run away!\u201d I cried with the skittish accent of an\r\nelderly dowager. \u201cI\u2019m sure Sir Eustace wouldn\u2019t like you to leave\r\nme alone with no one to talk to. You never seem to want to talk\r\nabout Florence. Oh, Mr. Pagett, I believe you have a guilty secret!\u201d\r\n\r\nI still had my hand on his arm, and I could feel the sudden start\r\nhe gave.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all, Miss Beddingfeld, not at all,\u201d he said earnestly. \u201cI\r\nshould be only too delighted to tell you all about it, but there\r\nreally are some cables\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Mr. Pagett, what a thin pretence. I shall tell Sir Eustace\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nI got no further. He gave another jump. The man\u2019s nerves seemed in\r\na shocking state.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it you want to know?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe resigned martyrdom of his tone made me smile inwardly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, everything! The pictures, the olive trees\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nI paused, rather at a loss myself.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose you speak Italian?\u201d I resumed.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a word, unfortunately. But of course, with hall porters\r\nand\u2014er\u2014guides.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d I hastened to reply. \u201cAnd which was your favourite\r\npicture?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, er\u2014the Madonna\u2014er\u2014Raphael, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear old Florence,\u201d I murmured sentimentally. \u201cSo picturesque on\r\nthe banks of the Arno. A beautiful river. And the Duomo, you\r\nremember the Duomo?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course, of course.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnother beautiful river, is it not?\u201d I hazarded. \u201cAlmost more\r\nbeautiful than the Arno?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDecidedly so, I should say.\u201d\r\n\r\nEmboldened by the success of my little trap, I proceeded further.\r\nBut there was little room for doubt. Mr. Pagett delivered himself\r\ninto my hands with every word he uttered. The man had never been\r\nin Florence in his life.\r\n\r\nBut, if not in Florence, where had he been? In England? Actually\r\nin England at the time of the Mill House Mystery? I decided on a\r\nbold step.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe curious thing is,\u201d I said, \u201cthat I fancied I had seen you\r\nbefore somewhere. But I must be mistaken\u2014since you were in Florence\r\nat the time. And yet\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nI studied him frankly. There was a hunted look in his eyes. He\r\npassed his tongue over his dry lips.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere\u2014er\u2014where\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2014did I think I had seen you?\u201d I finished for him. \u201cAt Marlow. You\r\nknow Marlow? Why, of course, how stupid of me, Sir Eustace has a\r\nhouse there!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut with an incoherent muttered excuse, my victim rose and fled.\r\n\r\nThat night I invaded Suzanne\u2019s cabin, alight with excitement.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, Suzanne,\u201d I urged, as I finished my tale, \u201che was in\r\nEngland, in Marlow, at the time of the murder. Are you so sure now\r\nthat \u2018The Man in the Brown Suit\u2019 is guilty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure of one thing,\u201d said Suzanne, twinkling unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat \u2018The Man in the Brown Suit\u2019 is better looking than poor Mr.\r\nPagett. No, Anne, don\u2019t get cross. I was only teasing. Sit down\r\nhere. Joking apart, I think you\u2019ve made a very important discovery.\r\nUp till now, we\u2019ve considered Pagett as having an alibi. Now we\r\nknow he hasn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d I said. \u201cWe must keep an eye on him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs well as everybody else,\u201d she said ruefully. \u201cWell, that\u2019s one\r\nof the things I wanted to talk to you about. That\u2014and finance. No,\r\ndon\u2019t stick your nose in the air. I know you are absurdly proud\r\nand independent, but you\u2019ve got to listen to horse sense over this.\r\nWe\u2019re partners\u2014I wouldn\u2019t offer you a penny because I liked you,\r\nor because you\u2019re a friendless girl\u2014what I want is a thrill, and\r\nI\u2019m prepared to pay for it. We\u2019re going into this together\r\nregardless of expense. To begin with you\u2019ll come with me to the\r\nMount Nelson Hotel at my expense, and we\u2019ll plan out our campaign.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe argued the point. In the end I gave in. But I didn\u2019t like it.\r\nI wanted to do the thing on my own.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s settled,\u201d said Suzanne at last, getting up and stretching\r\nherself with a big yawn. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted with my own eloquence. Now\r\nthen, let us discuss our victims. Mr. Chichester is going on to\r\nDurban. Sir Eustace is going to the Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town\r\nand then up to Rhodesia. He\u2019s going to have a private car on the\r\nrailway, and in a moment of expansion, after his fourth glass of\r\nchampagne the other night, he offered me a place in it. I dare say\r\nhe didn\u2019t really mean it, but, all the same, he can\u2019t very well\r\nback out if I hold him to it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d I approved. \u201cYou keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Pagett,\r\nand I take on Chichester. But what about Colonel Race?\u201d\r\n\r\nSuzanne looked at me queerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnne, you can\u2019t possibly suspect\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do. I suspect everybody. I\u2019m in the mood when one looks round\r\nfor the most unlikely person.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cColonel Race is going to Rhodesia too,\u201d said Suzanne thoughtfully.\r\n\u201cIf we could arrange for Sir Eustace to invite him also\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can manage it. You can manage anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI love butter,\u201d purred Suzanne.\r\n\r\nWe parted on the understanding that Suzanne should employ her\r\ntalents to the best advantage.\r\n\r\nI felt too excited to go to bed immediately. It was my last night\r\non board. Early to-morrow morning we should be in Table Bay.\r\n\r\nI slipped up on deck. The breeze was fresh and cool. The boat was\r\nrolling a little in the choppy sea. The decks were dark and\r\ndeserted. It was after midnight.\r\n\r\nI leaned over the rail, watching the phosphorescent trail of foam.\r\nAhead of us lay Africa, we were rushing towards it through the dark\r\nwater. I felt alone in a wonderful world. Wrapped in a strange\r\npeace, I stood there, taking no heed of time, lost in a dream.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly I had a curious intimate premonition of danger. I had\r\nheard nothing, but I swung round instinctively. A shadowy form had\r\ncrept up behind me. As I turned, it sprang. One hand gripped my\r\nthroat, stifling any cry I might have uttered. I fought desperately,\r\nbut I had no chance. I was half choking from the grip on my throat,\r\nbut I bit and clung and scratched in the most approved feminine\r\nfashion. The man was handicapped by having to keep me from crying\r\nout. If he had succeeded in reaching me unawares it would have been\r\neasy enough for him to sling me overboard with a sudden heave. The\r\nsharks would have taken care of the rest.\r\n\r\nStruggle as I would, I felt myself weakening. My assailant felt it\r\ntoo. He put out all his strength. And then, running on swift\r\nnoiseless feet, another shadow joined in. With one blow of his\r\nfist, he sent my opponent crashing headlong to the deck. Released,\r\nI fell back against the rail, sick and trembling.\r\n\r\nMy rescuer turned to me with a quick movement.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurt!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was something savage in his tone\u2014a menace against the person\r\nwho had dared to hurt me. Even before he spoke I had recognized\r\nhim. It was my man\u2014the man with the scar.\r\n\r\nBut that one moment in which his attention had been diverted to me\r\nhad been enough for the fallen enemy. Quick as a flash he had risen\r\nto his feet and taken to his heels down the deck. With an oath\r\nRayburn sprang after him.\r\n\r\nI always hate being out of things. I joined the chase\u2014a bad third.\r\nRound the deck we went to the starboard side of the ship. There by\r\nthe saloon door lay the man in a crumpled heap. Rayburn was bending\r\nover him.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you hit him again?\u201d I called breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was no need,\u201d he replied grimly. \u201cI found him collapsed by\r\nthe door. Or else he couldn\u2019t get it open and is shamming. We\u2019ll\r\nsoon see about that. And we\u2019ll see who he is too.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a beating heart I drew near. I had realized at once that my\r\nassailant was a bigger man than Chichester. Anyway, Chichester was\r\na flabby creature who might use a knife at a pinch, but who would\r\nhave little strength in his bare hands.\r\n\r\nRayburn struck a match. We both uttered an ejaculation. The man\r\nwas Guy Pagett.\r\n\r\nRayburn appeared absolutely stupefied by the discovery.\r\n\r\n\u201cPagett,\u201d he muttered. \u201cMy God, Pagett.\u201d\r\n\r\nI felt a slight sense of superiority.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou seem surprised.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am,\u201d he said heavily. \u201cI never suspected\u2014\u2014\u201d He wheeled suddenly\r\nround on me. \u201cAnd you? You\u2019re not? You recognized him, I suppose,\r\nwhen he attacked you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. All the same, I\u2019m not so very surprised.\u201d He stared\r\nat me suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere do you come in, I wonder? And how much do you know?\u201d\r\n\r\nI smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cA good deal, Mr.\u2014er\u2014Lucas!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe caught my arm, the unconscious strength of his grip made me\r\nwince.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere did you get that name?\u201d he asked hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it yours?\u201d I demanded sweetly. \u201cOr do you prefer to be\r\ncalled \u2018The Man in the Brown Suit\u2019?\u201d\r\n\r\nThat did stagger him. He released my arm and fell back a pace or\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you a girl or a witch?\u201d he breathed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a friend.\u201d I advanced a step towards him. \u201cI offered you my\r\nhelp once\u2014I offer it again. Will you have it?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe fierceness of his answer took me aback.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. I\u2019ll have no truck with you or with any woman. Do your\r\ndamnedest.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs before, my own temper began to rise.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d I said, \u201cyou don\u2019t realize how much in my power you are?\r\nA word from me to the Captain\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSay it,\u201d he sneered. Then advancing with a quick step: \u201cAnd whilst\r\nwe\u2019re realizing things, my girl, do you realize that you\u2019re in _my_\r\npower this minute? I could take you by the throat like this.\u201d With\r\na swift gesture he suited the action to the word. I felt his two\r\nhands clasp my throat and press\u2014ever so little. \u201cLike this\u2014and\r\nsqueeze the life out of you! And then\u2014like our unconscious friend\r\nhere, but with more success\u2014fling your dead body to the sharks.\r\nWhat do you say to that?\u201d\r\n\r\nI said nothing. I laughed. And yet I knew that the danger was real.\r\nJust at that moment he hated me. But I knew that I loved the\r\ndanger, loved the feeling of his hands on my throat. That I would\r\nnot have exchanged that moment for any other moment in my life. .\r\n. .\r\n\r\nWith a short laugh he released me.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnne Beddingfeld.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes nothing frighten you, Anne Beddingfeld?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d I said, with an assumption of coolness I was far from\r\nfeeling. \u201cWasps, sarcastic women, very young men, cockroaches, and\r\nsuperior shop assistants.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe gave the same short laugh as before. Then he stirred the\r\nunconscious form of Pagett with his feet.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall we do with this junk? Throw it overboard?\u201d he asked\r\ncarelessly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you like,\u201d I answered with equal calm.\r\n\r\n\u201cI admire your whole-hearted, blood-thirsty instincts, Miss\r\nBeddingfeld. But we will leave him to recover at his leisure. He\r\nis not seriously hurt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou shrink from a second murder, I see,\u201d I said sweetly.\r\n\r\n\u201cA second murder?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked genuinely puzzled.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe woman at Marlow,\u201d I reminded him, watching the effect of my\r\nwords closely.\r\n\r\nAn ugly brooding expression settled down on his face. He seemed to\r\nhave forgotten my presence.\r\n\r\n\u201cI might have killed her,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I believe that I\r\nmeant to kill her. . . .\u201d\r\n\r\nA wild rush of feeling, hatred of the dead woman, surged through\r\nme. _I_ could have killed her that moment, had she stood before\r\nme. . . . For he must have loved her once\u2014he must\u2014he must\u2014to have\r\nfelt like that!\r\n\r\nI regained control of myself and spoke in my normal voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe seem to have said all there is to be said\u2014except good night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood night and good-bye, Miss Beddingfeld.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAu revoir, Mr. Lucas.\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain he flinched at the name. He came nearer.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you say that\u2014au revoir, I mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause I have a fancy that we shall meet again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot if I can help it!\u201d\r\n\r\nEmphatic as his tone was, it did not offend me. On the contrary I\r\nhugged myself with secret satisfaction. I am not quite a fool.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll the same,\u201d I said gravely, \u201cI think we shall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head, unable to explain the feeling that had actuated\r\nmy words.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never wish to see you again,\u201d he said suddenly and violently.\r\n\r\nIt was really a very rude thing to say, but I only laughed softly\r\nand slipped away into the darkness.\r\n\r\nI heard him start after me, and then pause, and a word floated down\r\nthe deck. I think it was a \u201cwitch\u201d!\r\n\n  _(Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)_\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mount Nelson Hotel,\r\n\r\n  Cape Town.\r\n\r\nIt is really the greatest relief to get off the _Kilmorden._\r\n\r\nThe whole time that I was on board I was conscious of being\r\nsurrounded by a network of intrigue. To put the lid on everything,\r\nGuy Pagett must needs engage in a drunken brawl the last night. It\r\nis all very well to explain it away, but that is what it actually\r\namounts to. What else would you think if a man comes to you with\r\na lump the size of an egg on the side of his head and an eye\r\ncoloured all the tints of the rainbow?\r\n\r\nOf course Pagett would insist on trying to be mysterious about the\r\nwhole thing. According to him, you would think his black eye was\r\nthe direct result of his devotion to my interests. His story was\r\nextraordinarily vague and rambling, and it was a long time before\r\nI could make head or tail of it.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it appears he caught sight of a man behaving\r\nsuspiciously. Those are Pagett\u2019s words. He has taken them straight\r\nfrom the pages of a German Spy Story. What he means by a man\r\nbehaving suspiciously he doesn\u2019t know himself. I said so to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was slinking along in a very furtive manner, and it was the\r\nmiddle of the night, Sir Eustace.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what were you doing yourself? Why weren\u2019t you in bed and\r\nasleep like a good Christian?\u201d I demanded irritably.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had been coding those cables of yours, Sir Eustace, and typing\r\nthe diary up to date.\u201d\r\n\r\nTrust Pagett to be always in the right and a martyr over it!\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI just thought I would have a look around before turning in, Sir\r\nEustace. The man was coming down the passage from your cabin. I\r\nthought at once there was something wrong by the way he looked\r\nabout him. He slunk up the stairs by the saloon. I followed him.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Pagett,\u201d I said, \u201cwhy shouldn\u2019t the poor chap go on deck\r\nwithout having his footsteps dogged? Lots of people even sleep on\r\ndeck\u2014very uncomfortable, I\u2019ve always thought. The sailors wash you\r\ndown with the rest of the deck at five in the morning.\u201d I shuddered\r\nat the idea.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d I continued, \u201cif you went worrying some poor devil who\r\nwas suffering from insomnia, I don\u2019t wonder he landed you one.\u201d\r\n\r\nPagett looked patient.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you would hear me out, Sir Eustace. I was convinced the man\r\nhad been prowling about near your cabin where he had no business\r\nto be. The only two cabins down that passage are yours and Colonel\r\nRace\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRace,\u201d I said, lighting a cigar carefully, \u201ccan look after himself\r\nwithout your assistance, Pagett.\u201d I added as an afterthought: \u201cSo\r\ncan I.\u201d\r\n\r\nPagett came nearer and breathed heavily as he always does before\r\nimparting a secret.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, Sir Eustace, I fancied\u2014and now indeed I am sure\u2014it was\r\nRayburn.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRayburn?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Sir Eustace.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n\u201cRayburn has far too much sense to attempt to wake me up in the\r\nmiddle of the night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so, Sir Eustace. I think it was Colonel Race he went to see.\r\nA secret meeting\u2014for orders!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t hiss at me, Pagett,\u201d I said, drawing back a little, \u201cand do\r\ncontrol your breathing. Your idea is absurd. Why should they want\r\nto have a secret meeting in the middle of the night? If they\u2019d\r\nanything to say to each other, they could hob-nob over beef-tea in\r\na perfectly casual and natural manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nI could see that Pagett was not in the least convinced.\r\n\r\n_\u201cSomething_ was going on last night, Sir Eustace,\u201d he urged, \u201cor\r\nwhy should Rayburn assault me so brutally.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite sure it was Rayburn?\u201d\r\n\r\nPagett appeared to be perfectly convinced of that. It was the only\r\npart of the story that he wasn\u2019t vague about.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s something very queer about all this,\u201d he said. \u201cTo begin\r\nwith, where _is_ Rayburn?\u201d\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s perfectly true that we haven\u2019t seen the fellow since we came\r\non shore. He did not come up to the hotel with us. I decline to\r\nbelieve that he is afraid of Pagett, however.\r\n\r\nAltogether the whole thing is very annoying. One of my secretaries\r\nhas vanished into the blue, and the other looks like a disreputable\r\nprize-fighter. I can\u2019t take him about with me in his present\r\ncondition. I shall be the laughing-stock of Cape Town. I have an\r\nappointment later in the day to deliver old Milray\u2019s _billet-doux,_\r\nbut I shall not take Pagett with me. Confound the fellow and his\r\nprowling ways.\r\n\r\nAltogether I am decidedly out of temper. I had poisonous breakfast\r\nwith poisonous people. Dutch waitresses with thick ankles who took\r\nhalf an hour to bring me a bad bit of fish. And this farce of\r\ngetting up at 5 a.m. on arrival at the port to see a blinking\r\ndoctor and hold your hands above your head simply makes me tired.\r\n\r\n_Later._\r\n\r\nA very serious thing has occurred. I went to my appointment with\r\nthe Prime Minister, taking Milray\u2019s sealed letter. It didn\u2019t look\r\nas though it had been tampered with, but inside was a blank sheet\r\nof paper!\r\n\r\nNow, I suppose, I\u2019m in the devil of a mess. Why I ever let that\r\nbleating old fool Milray embroil me in the matter I can\u2019t think.\r\n\r\nPagett is a famous Job\u2019s comforter. He displays a certain gloomy\r\nsatisfaction that maddens me. Also, he has taken advantage of my\r\nperturbation to saddle me with the stationery trunk. Unless he is\r\ncareful, the next funeral he attends will be his own.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the end I had to listen to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cSupposing, Sir Eustace, that Rayburn had overheard a word or two\r\nof your conversation with Mr. Milray in the street? Remember, you\r\nhad no written authority from Mr. Milray. You accepted Rayburn on\r\nhis own valuation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think Rayburn is a crook, then?\u201d I said slowly.\r\n\r\nPagett did. How far his views were influenced by resentment over\r\nhis black eye I don\u2019t know. He made out a pretty fair case against\r\nRayburn. And the appearance of the latter told against him. My idea\r\nwas to do nothing in the matter. A man who has permitted himself\r\nto be made a thorough fool of is not anxious to broadcast the fact.\r\n\r\nBut Pagett, his energy unimpaired by his recent misfortunes, was\r\nall for vigorous measures. He had his way of course. He bustled\r\nout to the police station, sent innumerable cables, and brought a\r\nherd of English and Dutch officials to drink whiskies and sodas at\r\nmy expense.\r\n\r\nWe got Milray\u2019s answer that evening. He knew nothing of my late\r\nsecretary! There was only one spot of comfort to be extracted from\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt any rate,\u201d I said to Pagett, \u201cyou weren\u2019t poisoned. You had\r\none of your ordinary bilious attacks.\u201d\r\n\r\nI saw him wince. It was my only score.\r\n\r\n_Later._\r\n\r\nPagett is in his element. His brain positively scintillates with\r\nbright ideas. He will have it now that Rayburn is none other than\r\nthe famous \u201cMan in the Brown Suit.\u201d I dare say he is right. He\r\nusually is. But all this is getting unpleasant. The sooner I get\r\noff to Rhodesia the better. I have explained to Pagett that he is\r\nnot to accompany me.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, my dear fellow,\u201d I said, \u201cyou must remain here on the\r\nspot. You might be required to identify Rayburn any minute. And,\r\nbesides, I have my dignity as an English Member of Parliament to\r\nthink of. I can\u2019t go about with a secretary who has apparently\r\nrecently been indulging in a vulgar street-brawl.\u201d\r\n\r\nPagett winced. He is such a respectable fellow that his appearance\r\nis pain and tribulation to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what will you do about your correspondence and the notes for\r\nyour speeches, Sir Eustace?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall manage,\u201d I said airily.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour private car is to be attached to the eleven-o\u2019clock train\r\nto-morrow, Wednesday, morning,\u201d Pagett continued. \u201cI have made all\r\narrangements. Is Mrs. Blair taking a maid with her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Blair?\u201d I gasped.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe tells me you offered her a place.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo I did, now I come to think of it. On the night of the Fancy\r\nDress ball. I even urged her to come. But I never thought she\r\nwould! Delightful as she is, I do not know that I want Mrs. Blair\u2019s\r\nsociety all the way to Rhodesia and back. Women require such a lot\r\nof attention. And they are confoundedly in the way sometimes.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave I asked any one else?\u201d I said nervously. One does these\r\nthings in moments of expansion.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Blair seemed to think you had asked Colonel Race as well.\u201d\r\n\r\nI groaned.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must have been very drunk if I asked Race. Very drunk indeed.\r\nTake my advice, Pagett, and let your black eye be a warning to you,\r\ndon\u2019t go on the bust again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs you know, I am a teetotaller, Sir Eustace.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMuch wiser to take the pledge if you have a weakness that way. I\r\nhaven\u2019t asked any one else, have I, Pagett?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot that I know of, Sir Eustace.\u201d\r\n\r\nI heaved a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s Miss Beddingfeld,\u201d I said thoughtfully. \u201cShe wants to get\r\nto Rhodesia to dig up bones, I believe. I\u2019ve a good mind to offer\r\nher a temporary job as a secretary. She can typewrite, I know, for\r\nshe told me so.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, Pagett opposed the idea vehemently. He does not\r\nlike Anne Beddingfeld. Ever since the night of the black eye, he\r\nhas displayed uncontrollable emotion whenever she is mentioned.\r\nPagett is full of mysteries nowadays.\r\n\r\nJust to annoy him, I shall ask the girl. As I said before, she has\r\nextremely nice legs.\r\n\n  _(Anne\u2019s Narrative Resumed)_\r\n\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t suppose that as long as I live I shall forget my first\r\nsight of Table Mountain. I got up frightfully early and went out\r\non deck. I went right up to the boat deck, which I believe is a\r\nheinous offence, but I decided to dare something in the cause of\r\nsolitude. We were just steaming into Table Bay. There were fleecy\r\nwhite clouds hovering above Table Mountain, and nestling on the\r\nslopes below, right down to the sea, was the sleeping town, gilded\r\nand bewitched by the morning sunlight.\r\n\r\nIt made me catch my breath and have that curious hungry pain inside\r\nthat seizes one sometimes when one comes across something that\u2019s\r\nextra beautiful. I\u2019m not very good at expressing these things, but\r\nI knew well enough that I had found, if only for a fleeting moment,\r\nthe thing that I had been looking for ever since I left Little\r\nHampsly. Something new, something hitherto undreamed of, something\r\nthat satisfied my aching hunger for romance.\r\n\r\nPerfectly silently, or so it seemed to me, the _Kilmorden_ glided\r\nnearer and nearer. It was still very like a dream. Like all\r\ndreamers, however, I could not let my dream alone. We poor humans\r\nare so anxious not to miss anything.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is South Africa,\u201d I kept saying to myself industriously,\r\n\u201cSouth Africa, South Africa. You are seeing the world. This is the\r\nworld. You are seeing it. Think of it, Anne Beddingfeld, you\r\npudding-head. You\u2019re seeing the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had thought that I had the boat deck to myself, but now I observed\r\nanother figure leaning over the rail, absorbed as I had been in\r\nthe rapidly approaching city. Even before he turned his head I knew\r\nwho it was. The scene of last night seemed unreal and melodramatic\r\nin the peaceful morning sunlight. What must he have thought of me?\r\nIt made me hot to realize the things that I had said. And I hadn\u2019t\r\nmeant them\u2014or had I?\r\n\r\nI turned my head resolutely away and stared hard at Table Mountain.\r\nIf Rayburn had come up here to be alone, I, at least, need not\r\ndisturb him by advertising my presence.\r\n\r\nBut to my intense surprise I heard a light footfall on the deck\r\nbehind me, and then his voice, pleasant and normal:\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Beddingfeld.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\nI turned.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to apologize to you. I behaved like a perfect boor last\r\nnight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2014it was a peculiar night,\u201d I said hastily.\r\n\r\nIt was not a very lucid remark, but it was absolutely the only\r\nthing I could think of.\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you forgive me?\u201d\r\n\r\nI held out my hand without a word. He took it.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s something else I want to say.\u201d His gravity deepened. \u201cMiss\r\nBeddingfeld, you may not know it, but you are mixed up in a rather\r\ndangerous business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI gathered as much,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You can\u2019t possibly know. I want to warn you. Leave\r\nthe whole thing alone. It can\u2019t concern you really. Don\u2019t let your\r\ncuriosity lead you to tamper with other people\u2019s business. No,\r\nplease don\u2019t get angry again. I\u2019m not speaking of myself. You\u2019ve\r\nno idea of what you might come up against\u2014these men will stop at\r\nnothing. They are absolutely ruthless. Already you\u2019re in danger\u2014look\r\nat last night. They fancy you know something. Your only chance is\r\nto persuade them that they\u2019re mistaken. But be careful, always be\r\non the look out for danger, and, look here, if at any time you\r\nshould fall into their hands, don\u2019t try and be clever\u2014tell the\r\nwhole truth, it will be your only chance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou make my flesh creep, Mr. Rayburn,\u201d I said, with some truth.\r\n\u201cWhy do you take the trouble to warn me?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe did not answer for some minutes, then he said in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may be the last thing I can do for you. Once on shore I shall\r\nbe all right\u2014but I may not get on shore.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re not the only person on board who knows\r\nthat I am \u2018The Man in the Brown Suit.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you think that I told\u2014\u2014\u201d I said hotly.\r\n\r\nHe reassured me with a smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt you, Miss Beddingfeld. If I ever said I did, I lied.\r\nNo, but there\u2019s one person on board who\u2019s known all along. He\u2019s\r\nonly got to speak\u2014and my number\u2019s up. All the same, I\u2019m taking a\r\nsporting chance that he won\u2019t speak.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s a man who likes playing a lone hand. And when the\r\npolice have got me I should be of no further use to him. Free, I\r\nmight be! Well, an hour will show.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe laughed rather mockingly, but I saw his face harden. If he had\r\ngambled with Fate, he was a good gambler. He could lose and smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn any case,\u201d he said lightly, \u201cI don\u2019t suppose we shall meet\r\nagain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo\u2014good-bye.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-bye.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe gripped my hand hard, just for a minute his curious light eyes\r\nseemed to burn into mine, then he turned abruptly and left me. I\r\nheard his footsteps ringing along the deck. They echoed and\r\nre-echoed. I felt that I should hear them always. Footsteps\u2014going\r\nout of my life.\r\n\r\nI can admit frankly that I did not enjoy the next two hours. Not\r\ntill I stood on the wharf, having finished with most of the\r\nridiculous formalities that bureaucracies require, did I breathe\r\nfreely once more. No arrest had been made, and I realized that it\r\nwas a heavenly day, and that I was extremely hungry. I joined\r\nSuzanne. In any case, I was staying the night with her at the\r\nhotel. The boat did not go on to Port Elizabeth and Durban until\r\nthe following morning. We got into a taxi and drove to the Mount\r\nNelson.\r\n\r\nIt was all heavenly. The sun, the air, the flowers! When I thought\r\nof Little Hampsly in January, the mud knee-deep, and the\r\nsure-to-be-falling rain, I hugged myself with delight. Suzanne was\r\nnot nearly so enthusiastic. She has travelled a great deal of\r\ncourse. Besides, she is not the type that gets excited before\r\nbreakfast. She snubbed me severely when I let out an enthusiastic\r\nyelp at the sight of a giant blue convolvulus.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I should like to make it clear here and now that this\r\nstory will not be a story of South Africa. I guarantee no genuine\r\nlocal colour\u2014you know the sort of thing\u2014half a dozen words in\r\nitalics on every page. I admire it very much, but I can\u2019t do it.\r\nIn South Sea Islands, of course, you make an immediate reference\r\nto _b\u00eache-de-mer._ I don\u2019t know what _b\u00eache-de-mer_ is, I never\r\nhave known, I probably never shall know. I\u2019ve guessed once or twice\r\nand guessed wrong. In South Africa I know you at once begin to talk\r\nabout a _stoep_\u2014I do know what a _stoep_ is\u2014it\u2019s the thing round\r\na house and you sit on it. In various other parts of the world you\r\ncall it a veranda, a piazza, and a ha-ha. Then again, there are\r\npawpaws. I had often read of pawpaws. I discovered at once what\r\nthey were, because I had one plumped down in front of me for\r\nbreakfast. I thought at first that it was a melon gone bad. The\r\nDutch waitress enlightened me, and persuaded me to use lemon juice\r\nand sugar and try again. I was very pleased to meet a pawpaw. I\r\nhad always vaguely associated it with a _hula-hula,_ which, I\r\nbelieve, though I may be wrong, is a kind of straw skirt that\r\nHawaiian girls dance in. No, I think I am wrong\u2014that is a\r\n_lava-lava._\r\n\r\nAt any rate, all these things are very cheering after England. I\r\ncan\u2019t help thinking that it would brighten our cold Island life if\r\none could have a breakfast of _bacon-bacon,_ and then go out clad\r\nin a _jumper-jumper_ to pay the books.\r\n\r\nSuzanne was a little tamer after breakfast. They had given me a\r\nroom next to hers with a lovely view right out over Table Bay. I\r\nlooked at the view whilst Suzanne hunted for some special\r\nface-cream. When she had found it and started an immediate\r\napplication, she became capable of listening to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you see Sir Eustace?\u201d I asked. \u201cHe was marching out of the\r\nbreakfast room as we went in. He\u2019d had some bad fish or something\r\nand was just telling the head waiter what he thought about it, and\r\nhe bounced a peach on the floor to show how hard it was\u2014only it\r\nwasn\u2019t quite as hard as he thought and it squashed.\u201d\r\n\r\nSuzanne smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cSir Eustace doesn\u2019t like getting up early any more than I do. But,\r\nAnne, did you see Mr. Pagett? I ran against him in the passage.\r\nHe\u2019s got a black eye. What can he have been doing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly trying to push me overboard,\u201d I replied nonchalantly.\r\n\r\nIt was a distinct score for me. Suzanne left her face half anointed\r\nand pressed for details. I gave them to her.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt all gets more and more mysterious,\u201d she cried. \u201cI thought I\r\nwas going to have the soft job sticking to Sir Eustace, and that\r\nyou would have all the fun with the Rev. Edward Chichester, but\r\nnow I\u2019m not so sure. I hope Pagett won\u2019t push me off the train some\r\ndark night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019re still above suspicion, Suzanne. But, if the worst\r\nhappens, I\u2019ll wire to Clarence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat reminds me\u2014give me a cable form. Let me see now, what shall\r\nI say. \u2018Implicated in the most thrilling mystery please send me a\r\nthousand pounds at once Suzanne.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nI took the form from her, and pointed out that she could eliminate\r\na \u201cthe,\u201d an \u201ca,\u201d and possibly, if she didn\u2019t care about being\r\npolite, a \u201cplease.\u201d Suzanne, however, appears to be perfectly\r\nreckless in money matters. Instead of attending to my economical\r\nsuggestions, she added three words more: \u201cenjoying myself hugely.\u201d\r\n\r\nSuzanne was engaged to lunch with friends of hers, who came to the\r\nhotel about eleven o\u2019clock to fetch her. I was left to my own\r\ndevices. I went down through the grounds of the hotel, crossed the\r\ntram-lines and followed a cool shady avenue right down till I came\r\nto the main street. I strolled about, seeing the sights, enjoying\r\nthe sunlight and the black-faced sellers of flowers and fruits. I\r\nalso discovered a place where they had the most delicious ice-cream\r\nsodas. Finally, I bought a sixpenny basket of peaches and retraced\r\nmy steps to the hotel.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise and pleasure I found a note awaiting me. It was from\r\nthe curator of the Museum. He had read of my arrival on the\r\n_Kilmorden,_ in which I was described as the daughter of the late\r\nProfessor Beddingfeld. He had known my father slightly and had had\r\na great admiration for him. He went on to say that his wife would\r\nbe delighted if I would come out and have tea with them that\r\nafternoon at their Villa at Muizenberg. He gave me instructions\r\nfor getting there.\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant to think that poor Papa was still remembered and\r\nhighly thought of. I foresaw that I would have to be personally\r\nescorted round the Museum before I left Cape Town, but I risked\r\nthat. To most people it would have been a treat\u2014but one can have\r\ntoo much of a good thing if one is brought up on it, morning, noon\r\nand night.\r\n\r\nI put on my best hat (one of Suzanne\u2019s cast-offs) and my least\r\ncrumpled white linen and started off after lunch. I caught a fast\r\ntrain to Muizenberg and got there in about half an hour. It was a\r\nnice trip. We wound slowly round the base of Table Mountain, and\r\nsome of the flowers were lovely. My geography being weak, I had\r\nnever fully realized that Cape Town is on a peninsula, consequently\r\nI was rather surprised on getting out of the train to find myself\r\nfacing the sea once more. There was some perfectly entrancing\r\nbathing going on. The people had short curved boards and came\r\nfloating in on the waves. It was far too early to go to tea. I made\r\nfor the bathing pavilion, and when they said would I have a surf\r\nboard, I said \u201cYes, please.\u201d Surfing looks perfectly easy. _It\r\nisn\u2019t._ I say no more. I got very angry and fairly hurled my plank\r\nfrom me. Nevertheless, I determined to return on the first possible\r\nopportunity and have another go. I would not be beaten. Quite by\r\nmistake I then got a good run on my board, and came out delirious\r\nwith happiness. Surfing is like that. You are either vigorously\r\ncursing or else you are idiotically pleased with yourself.\r\n\r\nI found the Villa Medgee after some little difficulty. It was right\r\nup on the side of the mountain, isolated from the other cottages\r\nand villas. I rang the bell, and a smiling Kafir boy answered it.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Raffini?\u201d I inquired.\r\n\r\nHe ushered me in, preceded me down the passage and flung open a\r\ndoor. Just as I was about to pass in, I hesitated. I felt a sudden\r\nmisgiving. I stepped over the threshold and the door swung sharply\r\nto behind me.\r\n\r\nA man rose from his seat behind a table and came forward with\r\noutstretched hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo glad we have persuaded you to visit us, Miss Beddingfeld,\u201d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall man, obviously a Dutchman, with a flaming orange\r\nbeard. He did not look in the least like the curator of a museum.\r\nIn fact, I realized in a flash that I had made a fool of myself.\r\n\r\nI was in the hands of the enemy.\r\n\nIt reminded me forcibly of Episode III in \u201cThe Perils of Pamela.\u201d\r\nHow often had I not sat in the sixpenny seats, eating a twopenny\r\nbar of milk chocolate, and yearning for similar things to happen\r\nto me. Well, they had happened with a vengeance. And somehow it\r\nwas not nearly so amusing as I had imagined. It\u2019s all very well on\r\nthe screen\u2014you have the comfortable knowledge that there\u2019s bound\r\nto be an Episode IV. But in real life there was absolutely no\r\nguarantee that Anna the Adventuress might not terminate abruptly\r\nat the end of any Episode.\r\n\r\nYes, I was in a tight place. All the things that Rayburn had said\r\nthat morning came back to me with unpleasant distinctness. Tell\r\nthe truth, he had said. Well, I could always do that, but was it\r\ngoing to help me? To begin with, would my story be believed? Would\r\nthey consider it likely or possible that I had started off on this\r\nmad escapade simply on the strength of a scrap of paper smelling\r\nof moth balls? It sounded to me a wildly incredible tale. In that\r\nmoment of cold sanity I cursed myself for a melodramatic idiot,\r\nand yearned for the peaceful boredom of Little Hampsly.\r\n\r\nAll this passed through my mind in less time than it takes to tell.\r\nMy first instinctive movement was to step backwards and feel for\r\nthe handle of the door. My captor merely grinned.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere you are and here you stay,\u201d he remarked facetiously.\r\n\r\nI did my best to put a bold face upon the matter.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was invited to come here by the curator of the Cape Town Museum.\r\nIf I have made a mistake\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA mistake? Oh, yes, a big mistake!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe laughed coarsely.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat right have you to detain me? I shall inform the police\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYap, yap, yap\u2014like a little toy dog.\u201d He laughed.\r\n\r\nI sat down on a chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can only conclude that you are a dangerous lunatic,\u201d I said\r\ncoldly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like to point out to you that my friends are perfectly\r\nwell aware where I have gone, and that if I have not returned by\r\nthis evening, they will come in search of me. You understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo your friends know where you are, do they? Which of them?\u201d\r\n\r\nThus challenged, I did a lightning calculation of chances. Should\r\nI mention Sir Eustace? He was a well-known man, and his name might\r\ncarry weight. But if they were in touch with Pagett, they might\r\nknow I was lying. Better not risk Sir Eustace.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Blair, for one,\u201d I said lightly. \u201cA friend of mine with whom\r\nI am staying.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think not,\u201d said my captor, slyly shaking his orange head. \u201cYou\r\nhave not seen her since eleven this morning. And you received our\r\nnote, bidding you come here, at lunch-time.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis words showed me how closely my movements had been followed,\r\nbut I was not going to give in without a fight.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are very clever,\u201d I said. \u201cPerhaps you have heard of that\r\nuseful invention, the telephone? Mrs. Blair called me up on it when\r\nI was resting in my room after lunch. I told her then where I was\r\ngoing this afternoon.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo my great satisfaction, I saw a shade of uneasiness pass over\r\nhis face. Clearly he had overlooked the possibility that Suzanne\r\nmight have telephoned to me. I wished she really had done so!\r\n\r\n\u201cEnough of this,\u201d he said harshly, rising.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do with me?\u201d I asked, still endeavouring to\r\nappear composed.\r\n\r\n\u201cPut you where you can do no harm in case your friends come after\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment my blood ran cold, but his next words reassured me.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo-morrow you\u2019ll have some questions to answer, and after you\u2019ve\r\nanswered them we shall know what to do with you. And I can tell\r\nyou, young lady, we\u2019ve more ways than one of making obstinate\r\nlittle fools talk.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was not cheering, but it was at least a respite. I had until\r\nto-morrow. This man was clearly an underling obeying the orders of\r\na superior. Could that superior by any chance be Pagett?\r\n\r\nHe called and two Kafirs appeared. I was taken upstairs. Despite\r\nmy struggles, I was gagged and then bound hand and foot. The room\r\ninto which they had taken me was a kind of attic right under the\r\nroof. It was dusty and showed little signs of having been occupied.\r\nThe Dutchman made a mock bow and withdrew, closing the door behind\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI was quite helpless. Turn and twist as I would, I could not loosen\r\nmy hands in the slightest degree, and the gag prevented me from\r\ncrying out. If, by any possible chance, any one did come to the\r\nhouse, I could do nothing to attract their attention. Down below\r\nI heard the sound of a door shutting. Evidently the Dutchman was\r\ngoing out.\r\n\r\nIt was maddening not to be able to do anything. I strained again\r\nat my bonds, but the knots held. I desisted at last, and either\r\nfainted or fell asleep. When I awoke I was in pain all over. It\r\nwas quite dark now, and I judged that the night must be well\r\nadvanced, for the moon was high in the heavens and shining down\r\nthrough the dusty skylight. The gag was half choking me and the\r\nstiffness and pain were unendurable.\r\n\r\nIt was then that my eyes fell on a bit of broken glass lying in\r\nthe corner. A moonbeam slanted right down on it, and its glistening\r\nhad caught my attention. As I looked at it, an idea came into my\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nMy arms and legs were helpless, but surely I could still _roll._\r\nSlowly and awkwardly, I set myself in motion. It was not easy.\r\nBesides being extremely painful, since I could not guard my face\r\nwith my arms, it was also exceedingly difficult to keep any\r\nparticular direction.\r\n\r\nI tended to roll in every direction except the one I wanted to go.\r\nIn the end, however, I came right up against my objective. It\r\nalmost touched my bound hands.\r\n\r\nEven then it was not easy. It took an infinity of time before I\r\ncould wriggle the glass into such a position, wedged against the\r\nwall, that it would rub up and down on my bonds. It was a long\r\nheart-rending process, and I almost despaired, but in the end I\r\nsucceeded in sawing through the cords that bound my wrists. The\r\nrest was a matter of time. Once I had restored the circulation to\r\nmy hands by rubbing the wrists vigorously, I was able to undo the\r\ngag. One or two full breaths did a lot for me.\r\n\r\nVery soon I had undone the last knot, though even then it was some\r\ntime before I could stand on my feet, but at last I stood erect,\r\nswinging my arms to and fro to restore the circulation, and wishing\r\nabove all things that I could get hold of something to eat.\r\n\r\nI waited about a quarter of an hour, to be quite sure of my\r\nrecovered strength. Then I tiptoed noiselessly to the door. As I\r\nhad hoped, it was not locked, only latched. I unlatched it and\r\npeeped cautiously out.\r\n\r\nEverything was still. The moonlight came in through a window and\r\nshowed me the dusty uncarpeted staircase. Cautiously I crept down\r\nit. Still no sound\u2014but as I stood on the landing below, a faint\r\nmurmur of voices reached me. I stopped dead and stood there for\r\nsome time. A clock on the wall registered the fact that it was\r\nafter midnight.\r\n\r\nI was fully aware of the risks I might run if I descended lower,\r\nbut my curiosity was too much for me. With infinite precautions I\r\nprepared to explore. I crept softly down the last flight of stairs\r\nand stood in the square hall. I looked round me\u2014and then caught my\r\nbreath with a gasp. A Kafir boy was sitting by the hall door. He\r\nhad not seen me, indeed I soon realized by his breathing that he\r\nwas fast asleep.\r\n\r\nShould I retreat, or should I go on? The voices came from the room\r\nI had been shown into on arrival. One of them was that of my Dutch\r\nfriend, the other I could not for the moment recognize, though it\r\nseemed vaguely familiar.\r\n\r\nIn the end I decided that it was clearly my duty to hear all I\r\ncould. I must risk the Kafir boy waking up. I crossed the hall\r\nnoiselessly and knelt by the study door. For a moment or two I\r\ncould hear no better. The voices were louder, but I could not\r\ndistinguish what they said.\r\n\r\nI applied my eye to the keyhole instead of my ear. As I had guessed,\r\none of the speakers was the big Dutchman. The other man was sitting\r\noutside my circumscribed range of vision.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he rose to get himself a drink. His back, black clad and\r\ndecorous, came into view. Even before he turned round I knew who\r\nhe was.\r\n\r\nMr. Chichester!\r\n\r\nNow I began to make out the words.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll the same, it is dangerous. Suppose her friends come after\r\nher?\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was the big man speaking. Chichester answered him. He had\r\ndropped his clerical voice entirely. No wonder I had not recognized\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll bluff. They haven\u2019t an idea where she is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe spoke very positively.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI dare say. I\u2019ve looked into the matter, and we\u2019ve nothing to\r\nfear. Anyway, it\u2019s the \u2018Colonel\u2019s\u2019 orders. You don\u2019t want to go\r\nagainst them, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Dutchman ejaculated something in his own language. I judged it\r\nto be a hasty disclaimer.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why not knock her on the head?\u201d he growled. \u201cIt would be\r\nsimple. The boat is all ready. She could be taken out to sea?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Chichester meditatively. \u201cThat is what I should do.\r\nShe knows too much, that is certain. But the \u2018Colonel\u2019 is a man\r\nwho likes to play a lone hand\u2014though no one else must do so.\u201d\r\nSomething in his own words seemed to awaken a memory that annoyed\r\nhim. \u201cHe wants information of some kind from this girl.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe had paused before the information, and the Dutchman was quick\r\nto catch him up.\r\n\r\n\u201cInformation?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSomething of the kind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDiamonds,\u201d I said to myself.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d continued Chichester, \u201cgive me the lists.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a long time their conversation was quite incomprehensible to\r\nme. It seemed to deal with large quantities of vegetables. Dates\r\nwere mentioned, prices, and various names of places which I did\r\nnot know. It was quite half an hour before they had finished their\r\nchecking and counting.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Chichester, and there was a sound as though he pushed\r\nback his chair. \u201cI will take these with me for the \u2018Colonel\u2019 to\r\nsee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen do you leave?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTen o\u2019clock to-morrow morning will do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you want to see the girl before you go?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. There are strict orders that no one is to see her until the\r\n\u2018Colonel\u2019 comes. Is she all right?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI looked in on her when I came in for dinner. She was asleep, I\r\nthink. What about food?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA little starvation will do no harm. The \u2018Colonel\u2019 will be here\r\nsome time to-morrow. She will answer questions better if she is\r\nhungry. No one had better go near her till then. Is she securely\r\ntied up?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Dutchman laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\r\n\r\nThey both laughed. So did I, under my breath. Then, as the sounds\r\nseemed to betoken that they were about to come out of the room, I\r\nbeat a hasty retreat. I was just in time. As I reached the head of\r\nthe stairs, I heard the door of the room open, and at the same time\r\nthe Kafir stirred and moved. My retreat by the way of the hall door\r\nwas not to be thought of. I retired prudently to the attic, gathered\r\nmy bonds round me and lay down again on the floor, in case they\r\nshould take it into their heads to come and look at me.\r\n\r\nThey did not do so, however. After about an hour, I crept down the\r\nstairs, but the Kafir by the door was awake and humming softly to\r\nhimself. I was anxious to get out of the house, but I did not quite\r\nsee how to manage it.\r\n\r\nIn the end I was forced to retreat to the attic again. The Kafir\r\nwas clearly on guard for the night. I remained there patiently all\r\nthrough the sounds of early morning preparation. The men breakfasted\r\nin the hall, I could hear their voices distinctly floating up the\r\nstairs. I was getting thoroughly unnerved. How on earth was I to\r\nget out of the house?\r\n\r\nI counselled myself to be patient. A rash move might spoil\r\neverything. After breakfast came the sounds of Chichester departing.\r\nTo my intense relief, the Dutchman accompanied him.\r\n\r\nI waited breathlessly. Breakfast was being cleared away, the work\r\nof the house was being done. At last, the various activities seemed\r\nto die down. I slipped out from my lair once more. Very carefully\r\nI crept down the stairs. The hall was empty. Like a flash I was\r\nacross it, had unlatched the door, and was outside in the sunshine.\r\nI ran down the drive like one possessed.\r\n\r\nOnce outside, I resumed a normal walk. People stared at me\r\ncuriously, and I do not wonder. My face and clothes must have been\r\ncovered in dust from rolling about in the attic. At last I came to\r\na garage. I went in.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have met with an accident,\u201d I explained. \u201cI want a car to take\r\nme to Cape Town at once. I must catch the boat to Durban.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had not long to wait. Ten minutes later I was speeding along in\r\nthe direction of Cape Town. I must know if Chichester was on the\r\nboat. Whether to sail on her myself or not, I could not determine,\r\nbut in the end I decided to do so. Chichester would not know that\r\nI had seen him in the Villa at Muizenberg. He would doubtless lay\r\nfurther traps for me, but I was forewarned. And he was the man I\r\nwas after, the man who was seeking the diamonds on behalf of the\r\nmysterious \u201cColonel.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlas, for my plans! As I arrived at the docks, the _Kilmorden\r\nCastle_ was steaming out to sea. And I had no means of knowing\r\nwhether Chichester had sailed on her or not!\r\n\nI drove to the hotel. There was no one in the lounge that I knew.\r\nI ran upstairs and tapped on Suzanne\u2019s door. Her voice bade me\r\n\u201ccome in.\u201d When she saw who it was she literally fell on my neck.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnne, dear, where have you been? I\u2019ve been worried to death about\r\nyou. What have you been doing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHaving adventures,\u201d I replied. \u201cEpisode III of \u2018The Perils of\r\nPamela.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nI told her the whole story. She gave vent to a deep sigh when I\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy do these things always happen to you?\u201d she demanded plaintively.\r\n\u201cWhy does no one gag me and bind me hand and foot?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t like it if they did,\u201d I assured her. \u201cTo tell you\r\nthe truth, I\u2019m not nearly so keen on having adventures myself as\r\nI was. A little of that sort of thing goes a long way.\u201d\r\n\r\nSuzanne seemed unconvinced. An hour or two of gagging and binding\r\nwould have changed her views quickly enough. Suzanne likes thrills,\r\nbut she hates being uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what are we all doing now?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t quite know,\u201d I said thoughtfully. \u201cYou still go to\r\nRhodesia, of course, to keep an eye on Pagett\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d\r\n\r\nThat was just my difficulty. Had Chichester gone on the _Kilmorden,_\r\nor had he not? Did he mean to carry out his original plan of going\r\nto Durban? The hour of his leaving Muizenberg seemed to point to\r\nan affirmative answer to both questions. In that case, I might go\r\nto Durban by train. I fancied that I should get there before the\r\nboat. On the other hand, if the news of my escape were wired to\r\nChichester, and also the information that I had left Cape Town for\r\nDurban, nothing was simpler for him than to leave the boat at\r\neither Port Elizabeth or East London and so give me the slip\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nIt was rather a knotty problem.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll inquire about trains to Durban anyway,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not too late for morning tea,\u201d said Suzanne. \u201cWe\u2019ll have\r\nit in the lounge.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Durban train left at 8.15 that evening, so they told me at the\r\noffice. For the moment I postponed decision and joined Suzanne for\r\nsomewhat belated \u201celeven-o\u2019clock tea.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you feel that you would really recognize Chichester again\u2014in\r\nany other disguise, I mean?\u201d asked Suzanne.\r\n\r\nI shook my head ruefully.\r\n\r\n\u201cI certainly didn\u2019t recognize him as the stewardess, and never\r\nshould have but for your drawing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe man\u2019s a professional actor, I\u2019m sure of it,\u201d said Suzanne\r\nthoughtfully. \u201cHis make-up is perfectly marvellous. He might come\r\noff the boat as a navvy or something, and you\u2019d never spot him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re very cheering,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\nAt that minute, Colonel Race stepped in through the window and came\r\nand joined us.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is Sir Eustace doing?\u201d asked Suzanne. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him\r\nabout to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\nRather an odd expression passed over the Colonel\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a little trouble of his own to attend to which is keeping\r\nhim busy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTell us about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI mustn\u2019t tell tales out of school.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTell us something\u2014even if you have to invent it for our special\r\nbenefit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what would you say to the famous \u2018Man in the Brown Suit\u2019\r\nhaving made the voyage with us?\u201d\r\n\r\n_\u201cWhat?\u201d_\r\n\r\nI felt the colour die out of my face and then surge back again.\r\nFortunately Colonel Race was not looking at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fact, I believe. Every port watched for him and he\r\nbamboozled Pedler into bringing him out as his secretary!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot Mr. Pagett?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, not Pagett\u2014the other fellow. Rayburn, he called himself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave they arrested him?\u201d asked Suzanne. Under the table she gave\r\nmy hand a reassuring squeeze. I waited breathlessly for an answer.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe seems to have disappeared into thin air.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow does Sir Eustace take it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRegards it as a personal insult offered him by Fate.\u201d\r\n\r\nAn opportunity of hearing Sir Eustace\u2019s views on the matter\r\npresented itself later in the day. We were awakened from a\r\nrefreshing afternoon nap by a page-boy with a note. In touching\r\nterms it requested the pleasure of our company at tea in his\r\nsitting-room.\r\n\r\nThe poor man was indeed in a pitiable state. He poured out his\r\ntroubles to us, encouraged by Suzanne\u2019s sympathetic murmurs. (She\r\ndoes that sort of thing very well.)\r\n\r\n\u201cFirst a perfectly strange woman has the impertinence to get\r\nherself murdered in my house\u2014on purpose to annoy me, I do believe.\r\nWhy my house? Why, of all the houses in Great Britain, choose the\r\nMill House? What harm had I ever done the woman that she must needs\r\nget herself murdered there?\u201d\r\n\r\nSuzanne made one of her sympathetic noises again and Sir Eustace\r\nproceeded in a still more aggrieved tone.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd, if that\u2019s not enough, the fellow who murdered her has the\r\nimpudence, the colossal impudence, to attach himself to me as my\r\nsecretary. My secretary, if you please! I\u2019m tired of secretaries,\r\nI won\u2019t have any more secretaries. Either they\u2019re concealed\r\nmurderers or else they\u2019re drunken brawlers. Have you seen Pagett\u2019s\r\nblack eye? But of course you have. How can I go about with a\r\nsecretary like that? And his face is such a nasty shade of yellow\r\ntoo\u2014just the colour that doesn\u2019t go with a black eye. I\u2019ve done\r\nwith secretaries\u2014unless I have a girl. A nice girl, with liquid\r\neyes, who\u2019ll hold my hand when I\u2019m feeling cross. What about you,\r\nMiss Anne. Will you take on the job?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow often shall I have to hold your hand?\u201d I asked, laughing.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll day long,\u201d replied Sir Eustace gallantly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shan\u2019t get much typing done at that rate,\u201d I reminded him.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. All this work is Pagett\u2019s idea. He works me\r\nto death. I\u2019m looking forward to leaving him behind in Cape Town.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is staying behind?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, he\u2019ll enjoy himself thoroughly sleuthing about after Rayburn.\r\nThat\u2019s the sort of thing suits Pagett down to the ground. He adores\r\nintrigue. But I\u2019m quite serious in my offer. Will you come? Mrs.\r\nBlair here is a competent chaperon, and you can have a half-holiday\r\nevery now and again to dig for bones.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you very much, Sir Eustace,\u201d I said cautiously, \u201cbut I think\r\nI\u2019m leaving for Durban to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow don\u2019t be an obstinate girl. Remember, there are lots of lions\r\nin Rhodesia. You\u2019ll like lions. All girls do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill they be practising low jumps?\u201d I asked, laughing. \u201cNo, thank\r\nyou very much, but I must go to Durban.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir Eustace looked at me, sighed deeply, then opened the door of\r\nthe adjoining room and called to Pagett.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve quite finished your afternoon sleep, my dear fellow,\r\nperhaps you\u2019d do a little work for change.\u201d\r\n\r\nGuy Pagett appeared in the doorway. He bowed to us both, starting\r\nslightly at the sight of me, and replied in a melancholy voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been typing that memorandum all this afternoon, Sir\r\nEustace.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, stop typing it then. Go down to the Trade Commissioner\u2019s\r\nOffice, or the Board of Agriculture, or the Chamber of Mines, or\r\none of these places, and ask them to lend me some kind of a woman\r\nto take to Rhodesia. She must have liquid eyes and not object to\r\nmy holding her hand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Sir Eustace. I will ask for a competent short-hand-typist.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPagett\u2019s a malicious fellow,\u201d said Sir Eustace, after the secretary\r\nhad departed. \u201cI\u2019d be prepared to bet that he\u2019ll pick out some\r\nslab-faced creature on purpose to annoy me. She must have nice feet\r\ntoo\u2014I forgot to mention that.\u201d\r\n\r\nI clutched Suzanne excitedly by the hand and almost dragged her\r\nalong to her room.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Suzanne,\u201d I said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to make plans\u2014and make them\r\nquickly. Pagett is staying behind here\u2014you heard that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I suppose that means that I shan\u2019t be allowed to go to\r\nRhodesia\u2014which is very annoying, because I _want_ to go to Rhodesia.\r\nHow tiresome.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCheer up,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re going all right. I don\u2019t see how you\r\ncould back out at the last moment without its appearing frightfully\r\nsuspicious. And, besides, Pagett might suddenly be summoned by Sir\r\nEustace, and it would be far harder for you to attach yourself to\r\nhim for the journey up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would hardly be respectable,\u201d said Suzanne, dimpling. \u201cI should\r\nhave to pretend a fatal passion for him as an excuse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the other hand, if you were there when he arrived, it would\r\nall be perfectly simple and natural. Besides, I don\u2019t think we\r\nought to lose sight of the other two entirely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Anne, you surely can\u2019t suspect Colonel Race or Sir Eustace?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suspect everybody,\u201d I said darkly, \u201cand if you\u2019ve read any\r\ndetective stories, Suzanne, you must know that it\u2019s always the most\r\nunlikely person who\u2019s the villain. Lots of criminals have been\r\ncheerful fat men like Sir Eustace.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cColonel Race isn\u2019t particularly fat\u2014or particularly cheerful\r\neither.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSometimes they\u2019re lean and saturnine,\u201d I retorted. \u201cI don\u2019t say\r\nI seriously suspect either of them, but, after all, the woman was\r\nmurdered in Sir Eustace\u2019s house\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes, we needn\u2019t go over all that again. I\u2019ll watch him for\r\nyou, Anne, and if he gets any fatter and any more cheerful, I\u2019ll\r\nsend you a telegram at once. \u2018Sir E. swelling. Highly suspicious.\r\nCome at once.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally, Suzanne,\u201d I cried, \u201cyou seem to think all this is a game!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know I do,\u201d said Suzanne, unabashed. \u201cIt seems like that. It\u2019s\r\nyour fault, Anne. I\u2019ve got imbued with your \u2018Let\u2019s have an\r\nadventure\u2019 spirit. It doesn\u2019t seem a bit real. Dear me, if Clarence\r\nknew that I was running about Africa tracking dangerous criminals,\r\nhe\u2019d have a fit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you cable him about it?\u201d I asked sarcastically.\r\n\r\nSuzanne\u2019s sense of humour always fails her when it comes to sending\r\ncables. She considered my suggestion in perfectly good faith.\r\n\r\n\u201cI might. It would have to be a very long one.\u201d Her eyes brightened\r\nat the thought. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s better not. Husbands always want\r\nto interfere with perfectly harmless amusements.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, summing up the situation, \u201cyou will keep an eye on\r\nSir Eustace and Colonel Race\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know why I\u2019ve got to watch Sir Eustace,\u201d interrupted Suzanne,\r\n\u201cbecause of his figure and his humorous conversation. But I think\r\nit\u2019s carrying it rather far to suspect Colonel Race, I do indeed.\r\nWhy, he\u2019s something to do with the Secret Service. Do you know,\r\nAnne, I believe the best thing we could do would be to confide in\r\nhim and tell him the whole story.\u201d\r\n\r\nI objected vigorously to this unsporting proposal. I recognized in\r\nit the disastrous effects of matrimony. How often have I not heard\r\na perfectly intelligent female say, in the tone of one clinching\r\nan argument, _\u201cEdgar_ says\u2014\u2014\u201d And all the time you are perfectly\r\naware that Edgar is a perfect fool. Suzanne, by reason of her\r\nmarried state, was yearning to lean upon some man or other.\r\n\r\nHowever, she promised faithfully that she would not breathe a word\r\nto Colonel Race, and we went on with our plan-making.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that I must stay here and watch Pagett, and this\r\nis the best way to do it. I must pretend to leave for Durban this\r\nevening, take my luggage down and so on, but really I shall go to\r\nsome small hotel in the town. I can alter my appearance a\r\nlittle\u2014wear a fair toupee and one of those thick white lace veils,\r\nand I shall have a much better chance of seeing what he\u2019s really\r\nat if he thinks I\u2019m safely out of the way.\u201d\r\n\r\nSuzanne approved this plan heartily. We made due and ostentatious\r\npreparations, inquiring once more about the departure of the train\r\nat the office and packing my luggage.\r\n\r\nWe dined together in the restaurant. Colonel Race did not appear,\r\nbut Sir Eustace and Pagett were at their table in the window.\r\nPagett left the table half-way through the meal, which annoyed me,\r\nas I had planned to say goodbye to him. However, doubtless Sir\r\nEustace would do as well. I went over to him when I had finished.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-bye, Sir Eustace,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m off to-night to Durban.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir Eustace sighed heavily.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I heard. You wouldn\u2019t like me to come with you, would you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should love it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNice girl. Sure you won\u2019t change your mind and come and look for\r\nlions in Rhodesia?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe must be a very handsome fellow,\u201d said Sir Eustace plaintively.\r\n\u201cSome young whipper-snapper in Durban, I suppose, who puts my\r\nmature charms completely in the shade. By the way, Pagett\u2019s going\r\ndown in the car in a minute or two. He could take you to the\r\nstation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, thank you,\u201d I said hastily. \u201cMrs. Blair and I have got\r\nour own taxi ordered.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo go down with Guy Pagett was the last thing I wanted! Sir Eustace\r\nlooked at me attentively.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you like Pagett. I don\u2019t blame you. Of all the\r\nofficious, interfering asses\u2014going about with the air of a martyr,\r\nand doing everything he can to annoy and upset me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat has he done now?\u201d I inquired with some curiosity.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s got hold of a secretary for me. You never saw such a woman!\r\nForty, if she\u2019s a day, wears pince-nez and sensible boots and an\r\nair of brisk efficiency that will be the death of me. A regular\r\nslab-faced woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t she hold your hand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI devoutly hope not!\u201d exclaimed Sir Eustace. \u201cThat would be the\r\nlast straw. Well, good-bye, liquid eyes. If I shoot a lion I shan\u2019t\r\ngive you the skin\u2014after the base way you\u2019ve deserted me.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe squeezed my hand warmly and we parted. Suzanne was waiting for\r\nme in the hall. She was to come down to see me off.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s start at once,\u201d I said hastily, and motioned to the man to\r\nget a taxi.\r\n\r\nThen a voice behind me made me start:\r\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me, Miss Beddingfeld, but I\u2019m just going down in a car. I\r\ncan drop you and Mrs. Blair at the station.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, thank you,\u201d I said hastily. \u201cBut there\u2019s no need to trouble\r\nyou. I\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo trouble at all, I assure you. Put the luggage in, porter.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was helpless. I might have protested further, but a slight\r\nwarning nudge from Suzanne urged me to be on my guard.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, Mr. Pagett,\u201d I said coldly.\r\n\r\nWe all got into the car. As we raced down the road into the town,\r\nI racked my brains for something to say. In the end Pagett himself\r\nbroke the silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have secured a very capable secretary for Sir Eustace,\u201d he\r\nobserved. \u201cMiss Pettigrew.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t exactly raving about her just now,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\nPagett looked at me coldly.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is a proficient shorthand-typist,\u201d he said repressively.\r\n\r\nWe pulled up in front of the station. Here surely he would leave\r\nus. I turned with outstretched hand\u2014but no.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll come and see you off. It\u2019s just eight o\u2019clock, your train\r\ngoes in a quarter of an hour.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe gave efficient directions to porters. I stood helpless, not\r\ndaring to look at Suzanne. The man suspected. He was determined to\r\nmake sure that I did go by the train. And what could I do? Nothing.\r\nI saw myself, in a quarter of an hour\u2019s time, steaming out of the\r\nstation with Pagett planted on the platform waving me adieu. He\r\nhad turned the tables on me adroitly. His manner towards me had\r\nchanged, moreover. It was full of an uneasy geniality which sat\r\nill upon him, and which nauseated me. The man was an oily hypocrite.\r\nFirst he tried to murder me, and now he paid me compliments! Did\r\nhe imagine for one minute that I hadn\u2019t recognized him that night\r\non the boat? No, it was a pose, a pose which he forced me to\r\nacquiesce in, his tongue in his cheek all the while.\r\n\r\nHelpless as a sheep, I moved along under his expert directions. My\r\nluggage was piled in my sleeping compartment\u2014I had a two-berth one\r\nto myself. It was twelve minutes past eight. In three minutes the\r\ntrain would start.\r\n\r\nBut Paggett had reckoned without Suzanne.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will be a terribly hot journey, Anne,\u201d she said suddenly.\r\n\u201cEspecially going through the Karoo to-morrow. You\u2019ve got some\r\neau-de-Cologne or lavender water with you, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\nMy cue was plain.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, dear,\u201d I cried. \u201cI left my eau-de-Cologne on the dressing-table\r\nat the hotel.\u201d\r\n\r\nSuzanne\u2019s habit of command served her well. She turned imperiously\r\nto Pagett.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Pagett. Quick. You\u2019ve just time. There\u2019s a chemist almost\r\nopposite the station. Anne must have some eau-de-Cologne.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, but Suzanne\u2019s imperative manner was too much for him.\r\nShe is a born autocrat. He went. Suzanne followed him with her eyes\r\ntill he disappeared.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuick, Anne, get out the other side\u2014in case he hasn\u2019t really gone,\r\nbut is watching us from the end of the platform. Never mind your\r\nluggage. You can telegraph about that to-morrow. Oh, if only the\r\ntrain starts on time!\u201d\r\n\r\nI opened the gate on the opposite side to the platform and climbed\r\ndown. Nobody was observing me. I could just see Suzanne standing\r\nwhere I had left her, looking up at the train and apparently\r\nchatting to me at the window. A whistle blew, the train began to\r\ndraw out. Then I heard feet racing furiously up the platform. I\r\nwithdrew to the shadow of a friendly bookstall and watched.\r\n\r\nSuzanne turned from waving her handkerchief to the retreating\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\n\u201cToo late, Mr. Pagett,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cShe\u2019s gone. Is that\r\nthe eau-de-Cologne? What a pity we didn\u2019t think of it sooner!\u201d\r\n\r\nThey passed not far from me on their way out of the station. Guy\r\nPagett was extremely hot. He had evidently run all the way to the\r\nchemist and back.\r\n\r\n\u201cShall I get you a taxi, Mrs. Blair?\u201d\r\n\r\nSuzanne did not fail in her r\u00f4le.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, please. Can\u2019t I give you a lift back? Have you much to do\r\nfor Sir Eustace? Dear me, I wish Anne Beddingfeld was coming with\r\nus to-morrow. I don\u2019t like the idea of a young girl like that\r\ntravelling off to Durban all by herself. But she was set upon it.\r\nSome little attraction there, I fancy\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nThey passed out of ear-shot. Clever Suzanne. She had saved me.\r\n\r\nI allowed a minute or two to elapse and then I too made my way out\r\nof the station, almost colliding as I did so with a man\u2014an\r\nunpleasant-looking man with a nose disproportionately big for his\r\nface.\r\n\nI had no further difficulty in carrying out my plans. I found a\r\nsmall hotel in a back street, got a room there, paid a deposit as\r\nI had no luggage with me, and went placidly to bed.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning I was up early and went out into the town\r\nto purchase a modest wardrobe. My idea was to do nothing until\r\nafter the departure of the eleven-o\u2019clock train to Rhodesia with\r\nmost of the party on board. Pagett was not likely to indulge in\r\nany nefarious activities until he had got rid of them. Accordingly\r\nI took a tram out of the town and proceeded to enjoy a country\r\nwalk. It was comparatively cool, and I was glad to stretch my legs\r\nafter the long voyage and my close confinement at Muizenberg.\r\n\r\nA lot hinges on small things. My shoe-lace came untied, and I\r\nstopped to do it up. The road had just turned a corner, and as I\r\nwas bending over the offending shoe a man came right round and\r\nalmost walked into me. He lifted his hat, murmuring an apology,\r\nand went on. It struck me at the time that his face was vaguely\r\nfamiliar, but at the moment I thought no more of it. I looked at\r\nmy wrist-watch. The time was getting on. I turned my feet in the\r\ndirection of Cape Town.\r\n\r\nThere was a tram on the point of going and I had to run for it. I\r\nheard other footsteps running behind me. I swung myself on and so\r\ndid the other runner. I recognized him at once. It was the man who\r\nhad passed me on the road when my shoe came untied, and in a flash\r\nI knew why his face was familiar. It was the small man with the\r\nbig nose whom I had run into on leaving the station the night\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe coincidence was rather startling. Could it be possible that\r\nthe man was deliberately following me? I resolved to test that as\r\npromptly as possible. I rang the bell and got off at the next stop.\r\nThe man did not get off. I withdrew into the shadow of a shop\r\ndoorway and watched. He alighted at the next stop and walked back\r\nin my direction.\r\n\r\nThe case was clear enough. I was being followed. I had crowed too\r\nsoon. My victory over Guy Pagett took on another aspect. I hailed\r\nthe next tram and, as I expected, my shadower also got on. I gave\r\nmyself up to some very serious thinking.\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly apparent that I had stumbled on a bigger thing\r\nthan I knew. The murder in the house at Marlow was not an isolated\r\nincident committed by a solitary individual. I was up against a\r\ngang, and, thanks to Colonel Race\u2019s revelations to Suzanne, and\r\nwhat I had overheard at the house at Muizenberg, I was beginning\r\nto understand some of its manifold activities. Systematized crime,\r\norganized by the man known to his followers as the \u201cColonel\u201d! I\r\nremembered some of the talk I had heard on board ship, of the\r\nstrike on the Rand and the causes underlying it\u2014and the belief that\r\nsome secret organization was at work fomenting the agitation. That\r\nwas the \u201cColonel\u2019s\u201d work, his emissaries were acting according to\r\nplan. He took no part in these things himself, I had always heard,\r\nas he limited himself to directing and organizing. The brain-work\u2014not\r\nthe dangerous labour\u2014for him. But still it well might be that he\r\nhimself was on the spot, directing affairs from an apparently\r\nimpeccable position.\r\n\r\nThat, then, was the meaning of Colonel Race\u2019s presence on the\r\n_Kilmorden Castle._ He was out after the arch-criminal. Everything\r\nfitted in with that assumption. He was some one high up in the\r\nSecret Service whose business it was to lay the \u201cColonel\u201d by the\r\nheels.\r\n\r\nI nodded to myself\u2014things were becoming very clear to me. What of\r\nmy part in the affair? Where did I come in? Was it only diamonds\r\nthey were after? I shook my head. Great as the value of the diamonds\r\nmight be, they hardly accounted for the desperate attempts which\r\nhad been made to get me out of the way. No, I stood for more than\r\nthat. In some way, unknown to myself, I was a menace, a danger!\r\nSome knowledge that I had, or that they thought I had, made them\r\nanxious to remove me at all costs\u2014and that knowledge was bound up\r\nsomehow with the diamonds. There was one person, I felt sure, who\r\ncould enlighten me\u2014if he would! The Man in the Brown Suit\u2014Harry\r\nRayburn. He knew the other half of the story. But he had vanished\r\ninto the darkness, he was a hunted creature flying from pursuit.\r\nIn all probability he and I would never meet again. . . .\r\n\r\nI brought myself back with a jerk to the actualities of the moment.\r\nIt was no good thinking sentimentally of Harry Rayburn. He had\r\ndisplayed the greatest antipathy to me from the first. Or, at\r\nleast\u2014\u2014There I was again\u2014dreaming! The real problem was what to\r\ndo\u2014_now!_\r\n\r\nI, priding myself upon my r\u00f4le of watcher, had become the watched.\r\nAnd I was afraid! For the first time I began to lose my nerve. I\r\nwas the little bit of grit that was impeding the smooth working of\r\nthe great machine\u2014and I fancied that the machine would have a short\r\nway with little bits of grit. Once Harry Rayburn had saved me, once\r\nI had saved myself\u2014but I felt suddenly that the odds were heavily\r\nagainst me. My enemies were all around me in every direction, and\r\nthey were closing in. If I continued to play a lone hand I was\r\ndoomed.\r\n\r\nI rallied myself with an effort. After all, what could they do? I\r\nwas in a civilized city\u2014with policemen every few yards. I would be\r\nwary in future. They should not trap me again as they had done in\r\nMuizenberg.\r\n\r\nAs I reached this point in my meditations, the train arrived at\r\nAdderly Street. I got out. Undecided what to do, I walked slowly\r\nup the left-hand side of the street. I did not trouble to look if\r\nmy watcher was behind me. I knew he was. I walked into Cartwright\u2019s\r\nand ordered two coffee ice-cream sodas\u2014to steady my nerves. A man,\r\nI suppose, would have had a stiff peg; but girls derive a lot of\r\ncomfort from ice-cream sodas. I applied myself to the end of the\r\nstraw with gusto. The cool liquid went trickling down my throat in\r\nthe most agreeable manner. I pushed the first glass aside empty.\r\n\r\nI was sitting on one of the little high stools in front of the\r\ncounter. Out of the tail of my eye, I saw my tracker come in and\r\nsit down unostentatiously at a little table near the door. I\r\nfinished the second coffee soda and demanded a maple one. I can\r\ndrink practically an unlimited amount of ice-cream sodas.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the man by the door got up and went out. That surprised\r\nme. If he was going to wait outside, why not wait outside from the\r\nbeginning. I slipped down from my stool and went cautiously to the\r\ndoor. I drew back quickly into the shadow. The man was talking to\r\nGuy Pagett.\r\n\r\nIf I had ever had any doubts, that would have settled it. Pagett\r\nhad his watch out and was looking at it. They exchanged a few brief\r\nwords, and then the secretary swung on down the street towards the\r\nstation. Evidently he had given his orders. But what were they?\r\n\r\nSuddenly my heart leapt into my mouth. The man who had followed me\r\ncrossed to the middle of the road and spoke to a policeman. He\r\nspoke at some length, gesticulating towards Cartwright\u2019s and\r\nevidently explaining something. I saw the plan at once. I was to\r\nbe arrested on some charge or other\u2014pocket-picking, perhaps. It\r\nwould be easy enough for the gang to put through a simple little\r\nmatter like that. Of what good to protest my innocence? They would\r\nhave seen to every detail. Long ago they had brought a charge of\r\nrobbing De Beers against Harry Rayburn, and he had not been able\r\nto disprove it, though I had little doubt but that he had been\r\nabsolutely blameless. What chance had I against such a \u201cframe up\u201d\r\nas the \u201cColonel\u201d could devise?\r\n\r\nI glanced up at the clock almost mechanically, and immediately\r\nanother aspect of the case struck me. I saw the point of Guy\r\nPagett\u2019s looking at his watch. It was just on eleven, and at eleven\r\nthe mail train left for Rhodesia bearing with it the influential\r\nfriends who might otherwise come to my rescue. That was the reason\r\nof my immunity up to now. From last night till eleven this morning\r\nI had been safe, but now the net was closing in upon me.\r\n\r\nI hurriedly opened my bag and paid for my drinks, and as I did so,\r\nmy heart seemed to stand still, _for inside it was a man\u2019s wallet\r\nstuffed with notes!_ It must have been deftly introduced into my\r\nhandbag as I left the tram.\r\n\r\nPromptly I lost my head. I hurried out of Cartwright\u2019s. The little\r\nman with the big nose and the policeman were just crossing the\r\nroad. They saw me, and the little man designated me excitedly to\r\nthe policeman. I took to my heels and ran. I judged him to be a\r\nslow policeman. I should get a start. But I had no plan, even then.\r\nI just ran for my life down Adderly Street. People began to stare.\r\nI felt that in another minute some one would stop me.\r\n\r\nAn idea flashed into my head.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe station?\u201d I asked, in a breathless gasp.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust down on the right.\u201d\r\n\r\nI sped on. It is permissible to run for a train. I turned into the\r\nstation, but as I did so I heard footsteps close behind me. The\r\nlittle man with the big nose was a champion sprinter. I foresaw\r\nthat I should be stopped before I got to the platform I was in\r\nsearch of. I looked up to the clock\u2014one minute to eleven. I might\r\njust do it if my plan succeeded.\r\n\r\nI had entered the station by the main entrance in Adderly Street.\r\nI now darted out again through the side exit. Directly opposite me\r\nwas the side entrance to the post office, the main entrance to\r\nwhich is in Adderly Street.\r\n\r\nAs I expected, my pursuer, instead of following me in, ran down\r\nthe street to cut me off when I emerged by the main entrance, or\r\nto warn the policeman to do so.\r\n\r\nIn an instant I slipped across the street again and back into the\r\nstation. I ran like a lunatic. It was just eleven. The long train\r\nwas moving as I appeared on the platform. A porter tried to stop\r\nme, but I wriggled myself out of his grasp and sprang upon the\r\nfootboard. I mounted the two steps and opened the gate. I was safe!\r\nThe train was gathering way.\r\n\r\nWe passed a man standing by himself at the end of the platform. I\r\nwaved to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-bye, Mr. Pagett,\u201d I shouted.\r\n\r\nNever have I seen a man more taken aback. He looked as though he\r\nhad seen a ghost.\r\n\r\nIn a minute or two I was having trouble with the conductor. But I\r\ntook a lofty tone.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Sir Eustace Pedler\u2019s secretary,\u201d I said haughtily. \u201cPlease\r\ntake me to his private car.\u201d\r\n\r\nSuzanne and Colonel Race were standing on the rear observation\r\nplatform. They both uttered an exclamation of utter surprise at\r\nseeing me.\r\n\r\n\u201cHullo, Miss Anne,\u201d cried Colonel Race, \u201cwhere have you turned up\r\nfrom? I thought you\u2019d gone to Durban. What an unexpected person\r\nyou are.\u201d\r\n\r\nSuzanne said nothing, but her eyes asked a hundred questions.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must report myself to my chief,\u201d I said demurely. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s in the office\u2014middle compartment\u2014dictating at an incredible\r\nrate to the unfortunate Miss Pettigrew.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis enthusiasm for work is something new,\u201d I commented.\r\n\r\n\u201cH\u2019m!\u201d said Colonel Race. \u201cHis idea is, I think, to give her\r\nsufficient work to chain her to her typewriter in her own\r\ncompartment for the rest of the day.\u201d\r\n\r\nI laughed. Then, followed by the other two, I sought out Sir\r\nEustace. He was striding up and down the circumscribed space,\r\nhurling a flood of words at the unfortunate secretary whom I now\r\nsaw for the first time. A tall, square woman in drab clothing, with\r\npince-nez and an efficient air. I judged that she was finding it\r\ndifficult to keep pace with Sir Eustace, for her pencil was flying\r\nalong, and she was frowning horribly.\r\n\r\nI stepped into the compartment.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome aboard, sir,\u201d I said saucily.\r\n\r\nSir Eustace paused dead in the middle of a complicated sentence on\r\nthe labour situation and stared at me. Miss Pettigrew must be a\r\nnervous creature, in spite of her efficient air, for she jumped as\r\nthough she had been shot.\r\n\r\n\u201cGod bless my soul!\u201d ejaculated Sir Eustace. \u201cWhat about the young\r\nman in Durban?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI prefer you,\u201d I said softly.\r\n\r\n\u201cDarling,\u201d said Sir Eustace. \u201cYou can start holding my hand at\r\nonce.\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Pettigrew coughed, and Sir Eustace hastily withdrew his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me see, where were we? Yes. Tylman Roos,\r\nin his speech at\u2014\u2014What\u2019s the matter? Why aren\u2019t you taking it\r\ndown?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think,\u201d said Colonel Race gently, \u201cthat Miss Pettigrew has\r\nbroken her pencil.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe took it from her and sharpened it. Sir Eustace stared, and so\r\ndid I. There was something in Colonel Race\u2019s tone that I did not\r\nquite understand.\r\n\n_(Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)_\r\n\r\n\r\nI am inclined to abandon my Reminiscences. Instead I shall write\r\na short article entitled \u201cSecretaries I have had.\u201d As regards\r\nsecretaries, I seem to have fallen under a blight. At one minute\r\nI have no secretaries, at another I have too many. At the present\r\nminute I am journeying to Rhodesia with a pack of women. Race goes\r\noff with the two best-looking, of course, and leaves me with the\r\ndud. That is what always happens to me\u2014and, after all, this is _my_\r\nprivate car, not Race\u2019s.\r\n\r\nAlso Anne Beddingfeld is accompanying me to Rhodesia on the pretext\r\nof being my temporary secretary. But all this afternoon she has\r\nbeen out on the observation platform with Race exclaiming at the\r\nbeauty of the Hex River Pass. It is true that I told her her\r\nprincipal duty would be to hold my hand. But she isn\u2019t even doing\r\nthat. Perhaps she is afraid of Miss Pettigrew. I don\u2019t blame her\r\nif so. There is nothing attractive about Miss Pettigrew\u2014she is a\r\nrepellent female with large feet, more like a man than a woman.\r\n\r\nThere is something very mysterious about Anne Beddingfeld. She\r\njumped on board the train at the last minute, puffing like a\r\nsteam-engine for all the world as though she\u2019d been running a\r\nrace\u2014and yet Pagett told me that he\u2019d seen her off to Durban last\r\nnight! Either Pagett has been drinking again or else the girl must\r\nhave an astral body.\r\n\r\nAnd she never explains. Nobody ever explains. Yes, \u201cSecretaries I\r\nhave had.\u201d No. 1, a murderer fleeing from justice. No. 2, a secret\r\ndrinker who carries on disreputable intrigues in Italy. No. 3, a\r\nbeautiful girl who possesses the useful faculty of being in two\r\nplaces at once. No. 4, Miss Pettigrew, who, I have no doubt, is\r\nreally a particularly dangerous crook in disguise! Probably one of\r\nPagett\u2019s Italian friends that he has palmed off on me. I shouldn\u2019t\r\nwonder if the world found some day that it had been grossly deceived\r\nby Pagett. On the whole, I think Rayburn was the best of the bunch.\r\nHe never worried me or got in my way. Guy Pagett has had the\r\nimpertinence to have the stationery trunk put in here. None of us\r\ncan move without falling over it.\r\n\r\nI went out on the observation platform just now, expecting my\r\nappearance to be greeted with hails of delight. Both the women were\r\nlistening spellbound to one of Race\u2019s travellers\u2019 tales. I shall\r\nlabel this car\u2014not \u201cSir Eustace Pedler and Party,\u201d but \u201cColonel\r\nRace and Harem.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Blair must needs begin taking silly photographs. Every\r\ntime we went round a particularly appalling curve, as we climbed\r\nhigher and higher, she snapped at the engine.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see the point,\u201d she cried delightedly. \u201cIt must be some curve\r\nif you can photograph the front part of the train from the back,\r\nand with the mountain background it will look awfully dangerous.\u201d\r\n\r\nI pointed out to her that no one could possibly tell it had been\r\ntaken from the back of the train. She looked at me pityingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall write underneath it: \u2018Taken from the train. Engine going\r\nround a curve.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou could write that under any snapshot of a train,\u201d I said. Women\r\nnever think of these simple things.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019ve come up here in daylight,\u201d cried Anne Beddingfeld.\r\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have seen this if I\u2019d gone last night to Durban,\r\nshould I?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Colonel Race, smiling. \u201cYou\u2019d have waked up to-morrow\r\nmorning to find yourself in the Karoo, a hot, dusty desert of\r\nstones and rocks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I changed my mind,\u201d said Anne, sighing contentedly, and\r\nlooking round.\r\n\r\nIt was rather a wonderful sight. The great mountains all around,\r\nthrough which we turned and twisted and laboured ever steadily\r\nupwards.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs this the best train in the day to Rhodesia?\u201d asked Anne\r\nBeddingfeld.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the day?\u201d laughed Race. \u201cWhy, my dear Miss Anne, there are only\r\nthree trains a week. Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. Do you\r\nrealize that you don\u2019t arrive at the Falls until Saturday next?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow well we shall know each other by that time,\u201d said Mrs. Blair\r\nmaliciously. \u201cHow long are you going to stay at the Falls, Sir\r\nEustace?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat depends,\u201d I said cautiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn how things go at Johannesburg. My original idea was to stay a\r\ncouple of days or so at the Falls\u2014which I\u2019ve never seen, though\r\nthis is my third visit to Africa\u2014and then go on to Jo\u2019burg and\r\nstudy the conditions of things on the Rand. At home, you know, I\r\npose as being an authority on South African politics. But from all\r\nI hear, Jo\u2019burg will be a particularly unpleasant place to visit\r\nin about a week\u2019s time. I don\u2019t want to study conditions in the\r\nmidst of a raging revolution.\u201d\r\n\r\nRace smiled in a rather superior manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think your fears are exaggerated, Sir Eustace. There will be no\r\ngreat danger in Jo\u2019burg.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe women immediately looked at him in the \u201cWhat a brave hero you\r\nare\u201d manner. It annoyed me intensely. I am every bit as brave as\r\nRace\u2014but I lack the figure. These long, lean, brown men have it\r\nall their own way.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019ll be there,\u201d I said coldly.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery possibly. We might travel together.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that I shan\u2019t stay on at the Falls a bit,\u201d I answered\r\nnon-committally. Why is Race so anxious that I should go to Jo\u2019burg?\r\nHe\u2019s got his eye on Anne, I believe. \u201cWhat are your plans, Miss\r\nAnne?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat depends,\u201d she replied demurely, copying me.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you were my secretary,\u201d I objected.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, but I\u2019ve been cut out. You\u2019ve been holding Miss Pettigrew\u2019s\r\nhand all the afternoon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhatever I\u2019ve been doing, I can swear I\u2019ve not been doing that,\u201d\r\nI assured her.\r\n\r\n_Thursday night._\r\n\r\nWe have just left Kimberley. Race was made to tell the story of\r\nthe diamond robbery all over again. Why are women so excited by\r\nanything to do with diamonds?\r\n\r\nAt last Anne Beddingfeld has shed her veil of mystery. It seems\r\nthat she\u2019s a newspaper correspondent. She sent an immense cable\r\nfrom De Aar this morning. To judge by the jabbering that went on\r\nnearly all night in Mrs. Blair\u2019s cabin, she must have been reading\r\naloud all her special articles for years to come.\r\n\r\nIt seems that all along she\u2019s been on the track of \u201cThe Man in the\r\nBrown Suit.\u201d Apparently she didn\u2019t spot him on the _Kilmorden_\u2014in\r\nfact, she hardly had the chance, but she\u2019s now very busy cabling\r\nhome: \u201cHow I journeyed out with the Murderer,\u201d and inventing highly\r\nfictitious stories of \u201cWhat he said to me,\u201d etc. I know how these\r\nthings are done. I do them myself, in my Reminiscences when Pagett\r\nwill let me. And of course one of Nasby\u2019s efficient staff will\r\nbrighten up the details still more, so that when it appears in the\r\n_Daily Budget_ Rayburn won\u2019t recognize himself.\r\n\r\nThe girl\u2019s clever, though. All on her own, apparently, she\u2019s\r\nferreted out the identity of the woman who was killed in my house.\r\nShe was a Russian dancer called Nadina. I asked Anne Beddingfeld\r\nif she was sure of this. She replied that it was merely a\r\ndeduction\u2014quite in the Sherlock Holmes manner. However, I gather\r\nthat she had cabled it home to Nasby as a proved fact. Women have\r\nthese intuitions\u2014I\u2019ve no doubt that Anne Beddingfeld is perfectly\r\nright in her guess\u2014but to call it a deduction is absurd.\r\n\r\nHow she ever got on the staff of the _Daily Budget_ is more than\r\nI can imagine. But she is the kind of young woman who does these\r\nthings. Impossible to withstand her. She is full of coaxing ways\r\nthat mask an invincible determination. Look how she has got into\r\nmy private car!\r\n\r\nI am beginning to have an inkling why. Race said something about\r\nthe police suspecting that Rayburn would make for Rhodesia. He\r\nmight just have got off by Monday\u2019s train. They telegraphed all\r\nalong the line, I presume, and no one of his description was found,\r\nbut that says little. He\u2019s an astute young man and he knows Africa.\r\nHe\u2019s probably exquisitely disguised as an old Kafir woman\u2014and the\r\nsimple police continue to look for a handsome young man with a\r\nscar, dressed in the height of European fashion. I never did quite\r\nswallow that scar.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Anne Beddingfeld is on his track. She wants the glory of\r\ndiscovering him for herself and the _Daily Budget._ Young women\r\nare very cold-blooded nowadays. I hinted to her that it was an\r\nunwomanly action. She laughed at me. She assured me that did she\r\nrun him to earth her fortune was made. Race doesn\u2019t like it,\r\neither, I can see. Perhaps Rayburn is on this train. If so, we may\r\nall be murdered in our beds. I said so to Mrs. Blair\u2014but she seemed\r\nquite to welcome the idea, and remarked that if I were murdered it\r\nwould be really a terrific scoop for Anne! A scoop for Anne indeed!\r\n\r\nTo-morrow we shall be going through Bechuanaland. The dust will be\r\natrocious. Also at every station, little Kafir children come and\r\nsell you quaint wooden animals that they carve themselves. Also\r\nmealie bowls and baskets. I am rather afraid that Mrs. Blair may\r\nrun amok. There is a primitive charm about these toys that I feel\r\nwill appeal to her.\r\n\r\n_Friday evening._\r\n\r\nAs I feared. Mrs. Blair and Anne have bought forty-nine wooden\r\nanimals!\r\n\n_(Anne\u2019s Narrative Resumed)_\r\n\r\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed the journey up to Rhodesia.\r\n\r\nThere was something new and exciting to see every day. First the\r\nwonderful scenery of the Hex river valley, then the desolate\r\ngrandeur of the Karoo, and finally that wonderful straight stretch\r\nof line in Bechuanaland, and the perfectly adorable toys the\r\nnatives brought to sell. Suzanne and I were nearly left behind at\r\neach station\u2014if you could call them stations. It seemed to me that\r\nthe train just stopped whenever it felt like it, and no sooner had\r\nit done so than a horde of natives materialized out of the empty\r\nlandscape, holding up mealie bowls and sugar canes and fur karosses\r\nand adorable carved wooden animals. Suzanne began at once to make\r\na collection of the latter. I imitated her example\u2014most of them\r\ncost a \u201ctiki\u201d (threepence) and each was different. There were\r\ngiraffes and tigers and snakes and a melancholy looking eland and\r\nabsurd little black warriors. We enjoyed ourselves enormously.\r\n\r\nSir Eustace tried to restrain us\u2014but in vain. I still think it was\r\na miracle we were not left behind at some oasis of the line. South\r\nAfrican trains don\u2019t hoot or get excited when they are going to\r\nstart off again. They just glide quietly away, and you look up from\r\nyour bargaining and run for your life.\r\n\r\nSuzanne\u2019s amazement at seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town\r\ncan be imagined. We held an exhaustive survey of the situation on\r\nthe first evening out. We talked half the night.\r\n\r\nIt had become clear to me that defensive tactics must be adopted\r\nas well as aggressive ones. Travelling with Sir Eustace Pedler and\r\nhis party, I was fairly safe. Both he and Colonel Race were powerful\r\nprotectors, and I judged that my enemies would not wish to stir up\r\na hornet\u2019s nest about _my_ ears. Also, as long as I was near Sir\r\nEustace, I was more or less in touch with Guy Pagett\u2014and Guy Pagett\r\nwas the heart of the mystery. I asked Suzanne whether in her\r\nopinion it was possible that Pagett himself was the mysterious\r\n\u201cColonel.\u201d His subordinate position was, of course, against the\r\nassumption, but it had struck me once or twice that, for all his\r\nautocratic ways, Sir Eustace was really very much influenced by\r\nhis secretary. He was an easy-going man, and one whom an adroit\r\nsecretary might be able to twist round his little finger. The\r\ncomparative obscurity of his position might in reality be useful\r\nto him, since he would be anxious to be well out of the limelight.\r\n\r\nSuzanne, however, negatived these ideas very strongly. She refused\r\nto believe that Guy Pagett was the ruling spirit. The real head\u2014the\r\n\u201cColonel\u201d\u2014was somewhere in the background and had probably been\r\nalready in Africa at the time of our arrival.\r\n\r\nI agreed that there was much to be said for her view, but I was\r\nnot entirely satisfied. For in each suspicious instance Pagett had\r\nbeen shown as the directing genius. It was true that his personality\r\nseemed to lack the assurance and decision that one would expect\r\nfrom a master criminal\u2014but after all, according to Colonel Race,\r\nit was brain work only that this mysterious leader supplied, and\r\ncreative genius is often allied to a weak and timorous physical\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere speaks the Professor\u2019s daughter,\u201d interrupted Suzanne, when\r\nI had got to this point in my argument.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s true, all the same. On the other hand, Pagett may be the\r\nGrand Vizier, so to speak, of the All Highest.\u201d I was silent for\r\na minute or two, and then went on musingly: \u201cI wish I knew how Sir\r\nEustace made his money!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuspecting him again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuzanne, I\u2019ve got into that state that I can\u2019t help suspecting\r\nsomebody! I don\u2019t really suspect him\u2014but, after all, he _is_\r\nPagett\u2019s employer, and he _did_ own the Mill House.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always heard that he made his money in some way he isn\u2019t\r\nanxious to talk about,\u201d said Suzanne thoughtfully. \u201cBut that\r\ndoesn\u2019t necessarily mean crime\u2014it might be tin-tacks or hair\r\nrestorer!\u201d\r\n\r\nI agreed ruefully.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d said Suzanne doubtfully, \u201cthat we\u2019re not barking up\r\nthe wrong tree? Being led completely astray, I mean, by assuming\r\nPagett\u2019s complicity? Supposing that, after all, he is a perfectly\r\nhonest man?\u201d\r\n\r\nI considered that for a minute or two, then I shook my head.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter all, he has his explanations for everything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cY\u2014es, but they\u2019re not very convincing. For instance, the night he\r\ntried to throw me overboard on the _Kilmorden,_ he says he followed\r\nRayburn up on deck and Rayburn turned and knocked him down. Now we\r\nknow that\u2019s not true.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Suzanne unwillingly. \u201cBut we only heard the story at\r\nsecond-hand from Sir Eustace. If we\u2019d heard it direct from Pagett\r\nhimself, it might have been different. You know how people always\r\nget a story a little wrong when they repeat it.\u201d\r\n\r\nI turned the thing over in my mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said at last, \u201cI don\u2019t see any way out. Pagett\u2019s guilty.\r\nYou can\u2019t get away from the fact that he tried to throw me\r\noverboard, and everything else fits in. Why are you so persistent\r\nin this new idea of yours?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause of his face?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHis face? But\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I know what you\u2019re going to say. It\u2019s a sinister face. That\u2019s\r\njust it. No man with a face like that could be really sinister. It\r\nmust be a colossal joke on the part of Nature.\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not believe much in Suzanne\u2019s argument. I know a lot about\r\nNature in past ages. If she\u2019s got a sense of humour, she doesn\u2019t\r\nshow it much. Suzanne is just the sort of person who would clothe\r\nNature with all her own attributes.\r\n\r\nWe passed on to discuss our immediate plans. It was clear to me\r\nthat I must have some kind of standing. I couldn\u2019t go on avoiding\r\nexplanations for ever. The solution of all my difficulties lay\r\nready to my hand, though I didn\u2019t think of it for some time. The\r\n_Daily Budget!_ My silence or my speech could no longer affect\r\nHarry Rayburn. He was marked down as \u201cThe Man in the Brown Suit\u201d\r\nthrough no fault of mine. I could help him best by seeming to be\r\nagainst him. The \u201cColonel\u201d and his gang must have no suspicion that\r\nthere existed any friendly feeling between me and the man they had\r\nelected to be the scapegoat of the murder at Marlow. As far as I\r\nknew, the woman killed was still unidentified. I would cable to\r\nLord Nasby, suggesting that she was no other than the famous\r\nRussian dancer \u201cNadina\u201d who had been delighting Paris for so long.\r\nIt seemed incredible to me that she had not been identified\r\nalready\u2014but when I learnt more of the case long afterwards I saw\r\nhow natural it really was.\r\n\r\nNadina had never been to England during her successful career in\r\nParis. She was unknown to London audiences. The pictures in the\r\npapers of the Marlow victim were so blurred and unrecognizable that\r\nit is small wonder no one identified them. And, on the other hand,\r\nNadina had kept her intention of visiting England a profound secret\r\nfrom every one. The day after the murder a letter had been received\r\nby her manager purporting to be from the dancer, in which she said\r\nthat she was returning to Russia on urgent private affairs and that\r\nhe must deal with her broken contract as best he could.\r\n\r\nAll this, of course, I only learned afterwards. With Suzanne\u2019s full\r\napproval, I sent a long cable from De Aar. It arrived at a\r\npsychological moment (this again, of course, I learnt afterwards).\r\nThe _Daily Budget_ was hard up for a sensation. My guess was\r\nverified and proved to be correct and the _Daily Budget_ had the\r\nscoop of its lifetime. \u201cVictim of the Mill House Murder identified\r\nby our special reporter.\u201d And so on. \u201cOur reporter makes voyage\r\nwith the murderer. \u2018The Man in the Brown Suit.\u2019 What he is really\r\nlike.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe main facts were, of course, cabled to the South African papers,\r\nbut I only read my own lengthy articles at a much later date! I\r\nreceived approval and full instructions by cable at Bulawayo. I\r\nwas on the staff of the _Daily Budget,_ and I had a private word\r\nof congratulation from Lord Nasby himself. I was definitely\r\naccredited to hunt down the murderer, and I, and only I, knew that\r\nthe murderer was not Harry Rayburn! But let the world think that\r\nit was he\u2014best so for the present.\r\n\nWe arrived at Bulawayo early on Saturday morning. I was disappointed\r\nin the place. It was very hot, and I hated the hotel. Also Sir\r\nEustace was what I can only describe as thoroughly sulky. I think\r\nit was all our wooden animals that annoyed him\u2014especially the big\r\ngiraffe. It was a colossal giraffe with an impossible neck, a mild\r\neye and a dejected tail. It had character. It had charm. A\r\ncontroversy was already arising as to whom it belonged\u2014me or\r\nSuzanne. We had each contributed a tiki to its purchase. Suzanne\r\nadvanced the claims of seniority and the married state, I stuck to\r\nthe position that I had been the first to behold its beauty.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I must admit, it occupied a good deal of this\r\nthree-dimensional space of ours. To carry forty-nine wooden animals,\r\nall of awkward shape, and all of extremely brittle wood, is somewhat\r\nof a problem. Two porters were laden with a bunch of animals\r\neach\u2014and one promptly dropped a ravishing group of ostriches and\r\nbroke their heads off. Warned by this, Suzanne and I carried all\r\nwe could, Colonel Race helped, and I pressed the big giraffe into\r\nSir Eustace\u2019s arms. Even the correct Miss Pettigrew did not escape,\r\na large hippopotamus and two black warriors fell to her share. I\r\nhad a feeling Miss Pettigrew didn\u2019t like me. Perhaps she fancied\r\nI was a bold hussy. Anyway, she avoided me as much as she could.\r\nAnd the funny thing was, her face seemed vaguely familiar to me,\r\nthough I couldn\u2019t quite place it.\r\n\r\nWe reposed ourselves most of the morning, and in the afternoon we\r\ndrove out to the Matoppos to see Rhodes\u2019s grave. That is to say,\r\nwe were to have done so, but at the last moment Sir Eustace backed\r\nout. He was very nearly in as bad a temper as the morning we\r\narrived at Cape Town\u2014when he bounced the peaches on the floor and\r\nthey squashed! Evidently arriving early in the morning at places\r\nis bad for his temperament. He cursed the porters, he cursed the\r\nwaiters at breakfast, he cursed the whole hotel management, he\r\nwould doubtless have liked to curse Miss Pettigrew who hovered\r\naround with her pencil and pad, but I don\u2019t think even Sir Eustace\r\nwould have dared to curse Miss Pettigrew. She\u2019s just like the\r\nefficient secretary in a book. I only rescued our dear giraffe just\r\nin time. I feel Sir Eustace would have liked to dash him to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nTo return to our expedition, after Sir Eustace had backed out, Miss\r\nPettigrew said she would remain at home in case he might want her.\r\nAnd at the very last minute Suzanne sent down a message to say she\r\nhad a headache. So Colonel Race and I drove off alone.\r\n\r\nHe is a strange man. One doesn\u2019t notice it so much in a crowd. But,\r\nwhen one is alone with him, the sense of his personality seems\r\nreally almost overpowering. He becomes more taciturn, and yet his\r\nsilence seems to say more than speech might do.\r\n\r\nIt was so that day that we drove to the Matoppos through the soft\r\nyellow brown scrub. Everything seemed strangely silent\u2014except our\r\ncar which I should think was the first Ford ever made by man! The\r\nupholstery of it was torn to ribbons and, though I know nothing\r\nabout engines, even I could guess that all was not as it should be\r\nin its interior.\r\n\r\nBy and by the character of the country changed. Great boulders\r\nappeared, piled up into fantastic shapes. I felt suddenly that I\r\nhad got into a primitive era. Just for a moment Neanderthal men\r\nseemed quite as real to me as they had to Papa. I turned to Colonel\r\nRace.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere must have been giants once,\u201d I said dreamily. \u201cAnd their\r\nchildren were just like children are to-day\u2014they played with\r\nhandfuls of pebbles, piling them up and knocking them down, and\r\nthe more cleverly they balanced them, the better pleased they were.\r\nIf I were to give a name to this place I should call it \u2018The\r\nCountry of Giant Children.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re nearer the mark than you know,\u201d said Colonel Race\r\ngravely. \u201cSimple, primitive, big\u2014that is Africa.\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded appreciatively.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou love it, don\u2019t you?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. But to live in it long\u2014well, it makes one what you would call\r\ncruel. One comes to hold life and death very lightly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, thinking of Harry Rayburn. He had been like that\r\ntoo. \u201cBut not cruel to weak things?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOpinions differ as to what are and are not \u2018weak things,\u2019 Miss\r\nAnne.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a note of seriousness in his voice which almost startled\r\nme. I felt that I knew very little really of this man at my side.\r\n\r\n\u201cI meant children and dogs, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can truthfully say I\u2019ve never been cruel to children or dogs.\r\nSo you don\u2019t class women as \u2018weak things\u2019?\u201d\r\n\r\nI considered.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I do\u2014though they are, I suppose. That is, they\r\nare nowadays. But Papa always said that in the beginning men and\r\nwomen roamed the world together, equal in strength\u2014like lions and\r\ntigers\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd giraffes?\u201d interpolated Colonel Race slyly.\r\n\r\nI laughed. Every one makes fun of that giraffe.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd giraffes. They were nomadic, you see. It wasn\u2019t till they\r\nsettled down in communities, and women did one kind of thing and\r\nmen another that women got weak. And of course, underneath, one is\r\nstill the same\u2014one _feels_ the same, I mean, and that is why women\r\nworship physical strength in men\u2014it\u2019s what they once had and have\r\nlost.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlmost ancestor worship, in fact?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSomething of the kind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you really think that\u2019s true? That women worship strength, I\r\nmean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s quite true\u2014if one\u2019s honest. You think you admire\r\nmoral qualities, but when you fall in love, you revert to the\r\nprimitive where the physical is all that counts. But I don\u2019t think\r\nthat\u2019s the end\u2014if you lived in primitive conditions it would be\r\nall right, but you don\u2019t\u2014and so, in the end, the other thing wins\r\nafter all. It\u2019s the things that are apparently conquered that\r\nalways do win, isn\u2019t it? They win in the only way that counts. Like\r\nwhat the Bible says about losing your soul and finding it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the end,\u201d said Colonel Race thoughtfully, \u201cyou fall in love\u2014and\r\nyou fall out of it, is that what you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot exactly, but you can put it that way if you like.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever fallen out of love, Miss Anne?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d I admitted frankly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOr fallen in love, either?\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not answer.\r\n\r\nThe car drew up at our destination and brought the conversation to\r\na close. We got out and began the slow ascent to the World\u2019s View.\r\nNot for the first time, I felt a slight discomfort in Colonel\r\nRace\u2019s company. He veiled his thoughts so well behind those\r\nimpenetrable black eyes.\r\n\r\nHe frightened me a little. He had always frightened me. I never\r\nknew where I stood with him.\r\n\r\nWe climbed in silence till we reached the spot where Rhodes lies\r\nguarded by giant boulders. A strange eerie place, far from the\r\nhaunts of men, that sings a ceaseless p\u00e6an of rugged beauty.\r\n\r\nWe sat there for some time in silence. Then descended once more,\r\nbut diverging slightly from the path. Sometimes it was a rough\r\nscramble and once we came to a sharp slope or rock that was almost\r\nsheer.\r\n\r\nColonel Race went first, then turned to help me.\r\n\r\n\u201cBetter lift you,\u201d he said suddenly, and swung me off my feet with\r\na quick gesture.\r\n\r\nI felt the strength of him as he set me down and released his\r\nclasp. A man of iron, with muscles like taut steel. And again, I\r\nfelt afraid, especially as he did not move aside, but stood directly\r\nin front of me, staring into my face.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you really doing here, Anne Beddingfeld?\u201d he said\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a gipsy seeing the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s true enough. The newspaper correspondent is only a\r\npretext. You\u2019ve not the soul of the journalist. You\u2019re out for your\r\nown hand\u2014snatching at life. But that\u2019s not all.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat was he going to make me tell him? I was afraid\u2014afraid. I\r\nlooked him full in the face. My eyes can\u2019t keep secrets like his,\r\nbut they can carry the war into the enemy\u2019s country.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are _you_ really doing here, Colonel Race?\u201d I asked\r\ndeliberately.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I thought he wasn\u2019t going to answer. He was clearly\r\ntaken aback, though. At last he spoke, and his words seemed to\r\nafford him a grim amusement.\r\n\r\n\u201cPursuing ambition,\u201d he said. \u201cJust that\u2014pursuing ambition. You\r\nwill remember, Miss Beddingfeld, that \u2018by that sin fell the angels,\u2019\r\netc.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey say,\u201d I said slowly, \u201cthat you are really connected with the\r\nGovernment\u2014that you are in the Secret Service. Is that true?\u201d\r\n\r\nWas it my fancy, or did he hesitate for a fraction of a second\r\nbefore he answered?\r\n\r\n\u201cI can assure you, Miss Beddingfeld, that I am out here strictly\r\nas a private individual travelling for my own pleasure.\u201d\r\n\r\nThinking the answer over later, it struck me as slightly ambiguous.\r\nPerhaps he meant it to be so.\r\n\r\nWe rejoined the car in silence. Half-way back to Bulawayo we\r\nstopped for tea at a somewhat primitive structure at the side of\r\nthe road. The proprietor was digging in the garden and seemed\r\nannoyed at being disturbed. But he graciously promised to see what\r\nhe could do. After an interminable wait he brought us some stale\r\ncakes and some lukewarm tea. Then he disappeared to his garden\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he departed than we were surrounded by cats. Six of\r\nthem all miaowing piteously at once. The racket was deafening. I\r\noffered them some pieces of cake. They devoured them ravenously.\r\nI poured all the milk there was into a saucer and they fought each\r\nother to get it.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d I cried indignantly, \u201cthey\u2019re starved! It\u2019s wicked. Please,\r\nplease, order some more milk and another plate of cake.\u201d\r\n\r\nColonel Race departed silently to do my bidding. The cats had begun\r\nmiaowing again. He returned with a big jug of milk and the cats\r\nfinished it all.\r\n\r\nI got up with determination on my face.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take those cats home with us\u2014I shan\u2019t leave them\r\nhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear child, don\u2019t be absurd. You can\u2019t carry six cats as well\r\nas fifty wooden animals round with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind the wooden animals. These cats are alive. I shall take\r\nthem back with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will do nothing of the kind.\u201d I looked at him resentfully,\r\nbut he went on: \u201cYou think me cruel\u2014but one can\u2019t go through life\r\nsentimentalizing over these things. It\u2019s no good standing out\u2014I\r\nshan\u2019t allow you to take them. It\u2019s a primitive country, you know,\r\nand I\u2019m stronger than you.\u201d\r\n\r\nI always know when I am beaten. I went down to the car with tears\r\nin my eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re probably short of food just to-day,\u201d he explained\r\nconsolingly. \u201cThat man\u2019s wife has gone into Bulawayo for stores.\r\nSo it will be all right. And anyway, you know, the world\u2019s full of\r\nstarving cats.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t\u2014don\u2019t,\u201d I said fiercely.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m teaching you to realize life as it is. I\u2019m teaching you to be\r\nhard and ruthless\u2014like I am. That\u2019s the secret of strength\u2014and the\r\nsecret of success.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d sooner be dead than hard,\u201d I said passionately.\r\n\r\nWe got into the car and started off. I pulled myself together again\r\nslowly. Suddenly, to my intense astonishment, he took my hand in\r\nhis.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnne,\u201d he said gently, \u201cI want you. Will you marry me?\u201d\r\n\r\nI was utterly taken aback.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d I stammered. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care for you in that way. I\u2019ve never thought of you like\r\nthat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see. Is that the only reason?\u201d\r\n\r\nI had to be honest. I owed it him.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cit is not. You see\u2014I\u2014care for some one else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d he said again. \u201cAnd was that true at the beginning\u2014when\r\nI first saw you\u2014on the _Kilmorden?\u201d_\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered. \u201cIt was\u2014since then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d he said for the third time, but this time there was a\r\npurposeful ring in his voice that made me turn and look at him.\r\nHis face was grimmer than I had ever seen it.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2014what do you mean?\u201d I faltered.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me, inscrutable, dominating.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly\u2014that I know now what I have to do.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis words sent a shiver through me. There was a determination\r\nbehind them that I did not understand\u2014and it frightened me.\r\n\r\nWe neither of us said any more until we got back to the hotel. I\r\nwent straight up to Suzanne. She was lying on her bed reading, and\r\ndid not look in the least as though she had a headache.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere reposes the perfect gooseberry,\u201d she remarked. _\u201cAlias_ the\r\ntactful chaperone. Why, Anne dear, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\nFor I had burst into a flood of tears.\r\n\r\nI told her about the cats\u2014I felt it wasn\u2019t fair to tell her about\r\nColonel Race. But Suzanne is very sharp. I think she saw that there\r\nwas something more behind.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t caught a chill, have you, Anne? Sounds absurd even to\r\nsuggest such things in this heat, but you keep on shivering.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d I said. \u201cNerves\u2014or some one walking over my grave.\r\nI keep feeling something dreadful\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d said Suzanne, with decision. \u201cLet\u2019s talk of\r\nsomething interesting. Anne, about those diamonds\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure they\u2019re safe with me. It was all right before, no\r\none could think they\u2019d be amongst my things. But now that every\r\none knows we\u2019re such friends, you and I, I\u2019ll be under suspicion\r\ntoo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNobody knows they\u2019re in a roll of films, though,\u201d I argued. \u201cIt\u2019s\r\na splendid hiding-place and I really don\u2019t think we could better\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe agreed doubtfully, but said we would discuss it again when we\r\ngot to the Falls.\r\n\r\nOur train went at nine o\u2019clock. Sir Eustace\u2019s temper was still far\r\nfrom good, and Miss Pettigrew looked subdued. Colonel Race was\r\ncompletely himself. I felt that I had dreamed the whole conversation\r\non the way back.\r\n\r\nI slept heavily that night on my hard bunk, struggling with\r\nill-defined, menacing dreams. I awoke with a headache and went out\r\non the observation platform of the car. It was fresh and lovely,\r\nand everywhere, as far as one could see, were the undulating wooded\r\nhills. I loved it\u2014loved it more than any place I had ever seen. I\r\nwished then that I could have a little hut somewhere in the heart\r\nof the scrub and live there always\u2014always. . . .\r\n\r\nJust before half-past two, Colonel Race called me out from the\r\n\u201coffice\u201d and pointed to a bouquet-shaped white mist that hovered\r\nover one portion of the bush.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe spray from the Falls,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are nearly there.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was still wrapped in that strange dream feeling of exaltation\r\nthat had succeeded my troubled night. Very strongly implanted in\r\nme was the feeling that I had come home. . . . Home! And yet I had\r\nnever been here before\u2014or had I in dreams?\r\n\r\nWe walked from the train to the hotel, a big white building closely\r\nwired against mosquitoes. There were no roads, no houses. We went\r\nout on the _stoep_ and I uttered a gasp. There, half a mile away,\r\nfacing us, were the Falls. I\u2019ve never seen anything so grand and\r\nbeautiful\u2014I never shall.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnne, you\u2019re fey,\u201d said Suzanne, as we sat down to lunch. \u201cI\u2019ve\r\nnever seen you like this before.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stared at me curiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cAm I?\u201d I laughed, but I felt that my laugh was unnatural. \u201cIt\u2019s\r\njust that I love it all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than that.\u201d\r\n\r\nA little frown creased her brow\u2014one of apprehension.\r\n\r\nYes, I was happy, but beyond that I had the curious feeling that\r\nI was waiting for something\u2014something that would happen soon. I\r\nwas excited\u2014restless.\r\n\r\nAfter tea we strolled out, got on the trolley and were pushed by\r\nsmiling blacks down the little tracks of rails to the bridge.\r\n\r\nIt was a marvellous sight, the great chasm and the rushing waters\r\nbelow, and the veil of mist and spray in front of us that parted\r\nevery now and then for one brief minute to show the cataract of\r\nwater and then closed up again in its impenetrable mystery. That,\r\nto my mind, has always been the fascination of the Falls\u2014their\r\nelusive quality. You always think you\u2019re going to see\u2014and you never\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the bridge and walked slowly on by the path that was\r\nmarked out with white stone on either side and led round the brink\r\nof the gorge. Finally we arrived in a big clearing where on the\r\nleft a path led downwards towards the chasm.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe palm gully,\u201d explained Colonel Race. \u201cShall we go down? Or\r\nshall we leave it until to-morrow? It will take some time, and it\u2019s\r\na good climb up again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll leave it until to-morrow,\u201d said Sir Eustace with decision.\r\nHe isn\u2019t at all fond of strenuous physical exercise, I have noticed.\r\n\r\nHe led the way back. As we went, we passed a fine native stalking\r\nalong. Behind him came a woman who seemed to have the entire\r\nhousehold belongings piled upon her head! The collection included\r\na frying pan!\r\n\r\n\u201cI never have my camera when I want it,\u201d groaned Suzanne.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s an opportunity that will occur often enough, Mrs. Blair,\u201d\r\nsaid Colonel Race. \u201cSo don\u2019t lament.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe arrived back on the bridge.\r\n\r\n\u201cShall we go into the rainbow forest?\u201d he continued. \u201cOr are you\r\nafraid of getting wet?\u201d\r\n\r\nSuzanne and I accompanied him. Sir Eustace went back to the hotel.\r\nI was rather disappointed in the rainbow forest. There weren\u2019t\r\nnearly enough rainbows, and we got soaked to the skin, but every\r\nnow and then we got a glimpse of the Falls opposite and realized\r\nhow enormously wide they are. Oh, dear, dear Falls, how I love and\r\nworship you and always shall!\r\n\r\nWe got back to the hotel just in time to change for dinner. Sir\r\nEustace seems to have taken a positive antipathy to Colonel Race.\r\nSuzanne and I rallied him gently, but didn\u2019t get much satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, he retired to his sitting-room, dragging Miss\r\nPettigrew with him. Suzanne and I talked for a while with Colonel\r\nRace, and then she declared, with an immense yawn, that she was\r\ngoing to bed. I didn\u2019t want to be left alone with him, so I got up\r\ntoo and went to my room.\r\n\r\nBut I was far too excited to go to sleep. I did not even undress.\r\nI lay back in a chair and gave myself up to dreaming. And all the\r\ntime I was conscious of something coming nearer and nearer. . . .\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door and I started. I got up and went to\r\nit. A little black boy held out a note. It was addressed to me in\r\na handwriting I did not know. I took it and came back into the\r\nroom. I stood there holding it. At last I opened it. It was very\r\nshort:\r\n\r\n\u201cI must see you. I dare not come to the hotel. Will you come to\r\nthe clearing by the palm gully? In memory of Cabin 17 please come.\r\nThe man you knew as Harry Rayburn.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy heart beat to suffocation. He was here then! Oh, I had known\r\nit\u2014I had known it all along! I had felt him near me. All unwittingly\r\nI had come to his place of retreat.\r\n\r\nI wound a scarf round my head and stole to the door. I must be\r\ncareful. He was hunted down. No one must see me meet him. I stole\r\nalong to Suzanne\u2019s room. She was fast asleep. I could hear her\r\nbreathing evenly.\r\n\r\nSir Eustace? I paused outside the door of his sitting-room. Yes,\r\nhe was dictating to Miss Pettigrew, I could hear her monotonous\r\nvoice repeating. \u201cI therefore venture to suggest, that in tackling\r\nthis problem of coloured labour\u2014\u2014\u201d She paused for him to continue,\r\nand I heard him grunt something angrily.\r\n\r\nI stole on again. Colonel Race\u2019s room was empty. I did not see him\r\nin the lounge. And he was the man I feared most! Still, I could\r\nwaste no more time. I slipped quickly out of the hotel and took\r\nthe path to the bridge.\r\n\r\nI crossed it and stood there waiting in the shadow. If any one had\r\nfollowed me, I should see them crossing the bridge. But the minutes\r\npassed, and no one came. I had not been followed. I turned and took\r\nthe path to the clearing. I took six paces or so and then stopped.\r\nSomething had rustled behind me. It could not be any one who had\r\nfollowed me from the hotel. It was some one who was already here,\r\nwaiting.\r\n\r\nAnd immediately, without rhyme or reason, but with the sureness of\r\ninstinct, I knew that it was I myself who was threatened. It was\r\nthe same feeling as I had had on the _Kilmorden_ that night\u2014a sure\r\ninstinct warning me of danger.\r\n\r\nI looked sharply over my shoulder. Silence. I moved on a pace or\r\ntwo. Again I heard that rustle. Still walking, I looked over my\r\nshoulder again. A man\u2019s figure came out of the shadow. He saw that\r\nI saw him, and jumped forward, hard on my track.\r\n\r\nIt was too dark to recognize anybody. All I could see was that he\r\nwas tall, and a European, not a native. I took to my heels and ran.\r\nI heard him pounding behind. I ran quicker, keeping my eyes fixed\r\non the white stones that showed me where to step, for there was no\r\nmoon that night.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly my foot felt nothingness. I heard the man behind me\r\nlaugh, an evil, sinister laugh. It rang in my ears, as I fell\r\nheadlong\u2014down\u2014down\u2014down to destruction far beneath.\r\n\nI came to myself slowly and painfully. I was conscious of an aching\r\nhead and a shooting pain down my left arm when I tried to move,\r\nand everything seemed dream-like and unreal. Nightmare visions\r\nfloated before me. I felt myself falling\u2014falling again. Once Harry\r\nRayburn\u2019s face seemed to come to me out of the mist. Almost I\r\nimagined it real. Then it floated away again, mocking me. Once, I\r\nremember, some one put a cup to my lips and I drank. A black face\r\ngrinned into mine\u2014a devil\u2019s face, I thought it, and screamed out.\r\nThen dreams again\u2014long troubled dreams in which I vainly sought\r\nHarry Rayburn to warn him\u2014warn him\u2014what of? I did not know myself.\r\nBut there was some danger\u2014some great danger\u2014and I alone could save\r\nhim. Then darkness again, merciful darkness, and real sleep.\r\n\r\nI woke at last myself again. The long nightmare was over. I\r\nremembered perfectly everything that had happened, my hurried\r\nflight from the hotel to meet Harry, the man in the shadows and\r\nthat last terrible moment of falling. . . .\r\n\r\nBy some miracle or other I had not been killed. I was bruised and\r\naching and very weak, but I was alive. But where was I? Moving my\r\nhead with difficulty I looked round me. I was in a small room with\r\nrough wooden walls. On them were hung skins of animals and various\r\ntusks of ivory. I was lying on a kind of rough couch, also covered\r\nwith skins, and my left arm was bandaged up and felt stiff and\r\nuncomfortable. At first I thought I was alone, and then I saw a\r\nman\u2019s figure sitting between me and the light, his head turned\r\ntoward the window. He was so still that he might have been carved\r\nout of wood. Something in the close-cropped black head was familiar\r\nto me, but I did not dare to let my imagination run astray. Suddenly\r\nhe turned, and I caught my breath. It was Harry Rayburn. Harry\r\nRayburn in the flesh.\r\n\r\nHe rose and came over to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cFeeling better?\u201d he said a trifle awkwardly.\r\n\r\nI could not answer. The tears were running down my face. I was weak\r\nstill, but I held his hand in both of mine. If only I could die\r\nlike this, whilst he stood there looking down on me with that new\r\nlook in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Anne. Please don\u2019t cry. You\u2019re safe now. No one shall\r\nhurt you.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe went and fetched a cup and brought it to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cDrink some of this milk.\u201d\r\n\r\nI drank obediently. He went on talking in a low coaxing tone such\r\nas he might have used to a child.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask any more questions now. Go to sleep again. You\u2019ll be\r\nstronger by and by. I\u2019ll go away if you like.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said urgently. \u201cNo, no.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll stay.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe brought a small stool over beside me and sat there. He laid his\r\nhand over mine, and, soothed and comforted, I dropped off to sleep\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\nIt must have been evening then, but when I woke again the sun was\r\nhigh in the heavens. I was alone in the hut, but as I stirred an\r\nold native woman came running in. She was hideous as sin, but she\r\ngrinned at me encouragingly. She brought me water in a basin and\r\nhelped me wash my face and hands. Then she brought me a large bowl\r\nof soup, and I finished it every drop! I asked her several\r\nquestions, but she only grinned and nodded and chattered away in\r\na guttural language, so I gathered she knew no English.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she stood up and drew back respectfully as Harry Rayburn\r\nentered. He gave her a nod of dismissal and she went out leaving\r\nus alone. He smiled at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cReally better to-day!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, indeed, but very bewildered still. Where am I?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re on a small island on the Zambesi about four miles up from\r\nthe Falls.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo\u2014do my friends know I\u2019m here?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must send word to them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is as you like of course, but if I were you I should wait\r\nuntil you are a little stronger.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe did not answer immediately, so I went on.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long have I been here?\u201d\r\n\r\nHis answer amazed me.\r\n\r\n\u201cNearly a month.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d I cried. \u201cI must send word to Suzanne. She\u2019ll be terribly\r\nanxious.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho is Suzanne?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Blair. I was with her and Sir Eustace and Colonel Race at\r\nthe hotel\u2014but you knew that surely?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know nothing, except that I found you, caught in the fork of a\r\ntree, unconscious and with a badly wrenched arm.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere was the tree?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOverhanging the ravine. But for your clothes catching on the\r\nbranches, you would infallibly have been dashed to pieces.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shuddered. Then a thought struck me.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou say you didn\u2019t know I was there. What about the note then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat note?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe note you sent me, asking me to meet you in the clearing.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stared at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cI sent no note.\u201d\r\n\r\nI felt myself flushing up to the roots of my hair. Fortunately he\r\ndid not seem to notice.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you come to be on the spot in such a marvellous manner?\u201d\r\nI asked in as nonchalant a manner as I could assume. \u201cAnd what are\r\nyou doing in this part of the world, anyway?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI live here,\u201d he said simply.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn this island?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I came here after the War. Sometimes I take parties from the\r\nhotel out in my boat, but it costs me very little to live, and\r\nmostly I do as I please.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou live here all alone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am not pining for society, I assure you,\u201d he replied coldly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sorry to have inflicted mine upon you,\u201d I retorted, \u201cbut I\r\nseem to have had very little to say in the matter.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo my surprise his eyes twinkled a little.\r\n\r\n\u201cNone whatever. I slung you across my shoulders like a sack of coal\r\nand carried you to my boat. Quite like a primitive man of the Stone\r\nAge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut for a different reason,\u201d I put in.\r\n\r\n_He_ flushed this time, a deep burning blush. The tan of his face\r\nwas suffused.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you haven\u2019t told me how you came to be wandering about so\r\nconveniently for me?\u201d I said hastily, to cover his confusion.\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep. I was restless\u2014disturbed\u2014had the feeling\r\nsomething was going to happen. In the end I took the boat and came\r\nashore and tramped down towards the Falls. I was just at the head\r\nof the palm gully when I heard you scream.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you get help from the hotel instead of carting me all\r\nthe way here?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\nHe flushed again.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose it seems an unpardonable liberty to you\u2014but I don\u2019t\r\nthink that even now you realize your danger! You think I should\r\nhave informed your friends? Pretty friends, who allowed you to be\r\ndecoyed out to death. No, I swore to myself that I\u2019d take better\r\ncare of you than any one else could. Not a soul comes to this\r\nisland. I got old Batani, whom I cured of a fever once, to come\r\nand look after you. She\u2019s loyal. She\u2019ll never say a word. I could\r\nkeep you here for months and no one would ever know.\u201d\r\n\r\n_I could keep you here for months and no one would ever know!_ How\r\nsome words please one!\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did quite right,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cAnd I shall not send word\r\nto any one. A day or so more anxiety doesn\u2019t make much difference.\r\nIt\u2019s not as though they were my own people. They\u2019re only\r\nacquaintances really\u2014even Suzanne. And whoever wrote that note must\r\nhave known\u2014a great deal. It was not the work of an outsider.\u201d\r\n\r\nI managed to mention the note this time without blushing at all.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you would be guided by me\u2014\u2014\u201d he said, hesitating.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect I shall be,\u201d I answered candidly. \u201cBut there\u2019s no\r\nharm in hearing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you always do what you like, Miss Beddingfeld?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUsually,\u201d I replied cautiously. To any one else I would have said\r\n\u201cAlways.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI pity your husband,\u201d he said unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t,\u201d I retorted. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t dream of marrying any one\r\nunless I was madly in love with them. And of course there is really\r\nnothing a woman enjoys so much as doing all the things she doesn\u2019t\r\nlike for the sake of some one she _does_ like. And the more\r\nself-willed she is, the more she likes it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I disagree with you. The boot is on the other leg as\r\na rule.\u201d He spoke with a slight sneer.\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d I cried eagerly. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why there are so many\r\nunhappy marriages. It\u2019s all the fault of the men. Either they give\r\nway to their women\u2014and then the women despise them, or else they\r\nare utterly selfish, insist on their own way and never say \u2018thank\r\nyou.\u2019 Successful husbands make their wives do just what they want,\r\nand then make a frightful fuss of them for doing it. Women like to\r\nbe mastered, but they hate not to have their sacrifices appreciated.\r\nOn the other hand, men don\u2019t really appreciate women who are nice\r\nto them all the time. When I am married, I shall be a devil most\r\nof the time, but every now and then, when my husband least expects\r\nit, I shall show him what a perfect angel I can be!\u201d\r\n\r\nHarry laughed outright.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a cat and dog life you will lead.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLovers always fight,\u201d I assured him. \u201cBecause they don\u2019t understand\r\neach other. And by the time they do understand each other they\r\naren\u2019t in love any more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes the reverse hold true? Are people who fight each other always\r\nlovers?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, momentarily confused.\r\n\r\nHe turned away to the fireplace.\r\n\r\n\u201cLike some more soup?\u201d he asked in a casual tone.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, please. I\u2019m so hungry that I could eat a hippopotamus.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe busied himself with the fire; I watched.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I can get off the couch, I\u2019ll cook for you,\u201d I promised.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you know anything about cooking.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can warm up things out of tins as well as you can,\u201d I retorted,\r\npointing to a row of tins on the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n_\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d_ he said, and laughed.\r\n\r\nHis whole face changed when he laughed. It became boyish, happy\u2014a\r\ndifferent personality.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed my soup. As I ate it I reminded him that he had not,\r\nafter all, tendered me his advice.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes, what I was going to say was this. If I were you I would\r\nstay quietly _perdu_ here until you are quite strong again. Your\r\nenemies will believe you dead. They will hardly be surprised at\r\nnot finding the body. It would have been dashed to pieces on the\r\nrocks and carried down with the torrent.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shivered.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnce you are completely restored to health, you can journey\r\nquietly on to Beira and get a boat to take you back to England.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat would be very tame,\u201d I objected scornfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere speaks a foolish schoolgirl.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a foolish schoolgirl,\u201d I cried indignantly. \u201cI\u2019m a woman.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with an expression I could not fathom as I sat up\r\nflushed and excited.\r\n\r\n\u201cGod help me, so you are,\u201d he muttered, and went abruptly out.\r\n\r\nMy recovery was rapid. The two injuries I had sustained were a\r\nknock on the head and a badly wrenched arm. The latter was the most\r\nserious and, to begin with, my rescuer had believed it to be\r\nactually broken. A careful examination, however, convinced him that\r\nit was not so, and although it was very painful I was recovering\r\nthe use of it quite quickly.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange time. We were cut off from the world, alone\r\ntogether as Adam and Eve might have been\u2014but with what a difference!\r\nOld Batani hovered about counting no more than a dog might have\r\ndone. I insisted on doing the cooking, or as much of it as I could\r\nmanage with one arm. Harry was out a good part of the time, but we\r\nspent long hours together lying out in the shade of the palms,\r\ntalking and quarrelling\u2014discussing everything under high heaven,\r\nquarrelling and making it up again. We bickered a good deal, but\r\nthere grew up between us a real and lasting comradeship such as I\r\ncould never have believed possible. That\u2014and something else.\r\n\r\nThe time was drawing near, I knew it, when I should be well enough\r\nto leave and I realized it with a heavy heart. Was he going to let\r\nme go? Without a word? Without a sign? He had fits of silence, long\r\nmoody intervals, moments when he would spring up and tramp off by\r\nhimself. One evening the crisis came. We had finished our simple\r\nmeal and were sitting in the doorway of the hut. The sun was\r\nsinking.\r\n\r\nHairpins were necessities of life with which Harry had not been\r\nable to provide me, and my hair, straight and black, hung to my\r\nknees. I sat, my chin on my hands, lost in meditation. I felt\r\nrather than saw Harry looking at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou look like a witch, Anne,\u201d he said at last, and there was\r\nsomething in his voice that had never been there before.\r\n\r\nHe reached out his hand and just touched my hair. I shivered.\r\nSuddenly he sprang up with an oath.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must leave here to-morrow, do you hear?\u201d he cried. \u201cI\u2014I can\u2019t\r\nbear any more. I\u2019m only a man after all. You must go, Anne. You\r\nmust. You\u2019re not a fool. You know yourself that this can\u2019t go on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose not,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cBut\u2014it\u2019s been happy, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHappy? It\u2019s been hell!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs bad as that!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you torment me for? Why are you mocking at me? Why do you\r\nsay that\u2014laughing into your hair?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t laughing. And I\u2019m not mocking. If you want me to go, I\u2019ll\r\ngo. But if you want me to stay\u2014I\u2019ll stay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot that!\u201d he cried vehemently. \u201cNot that. Don\u2019t tempt me, Anne.\r\nDo you realize what I am? A criminal twice over. A man hunted down.\r\nThey know me here as Harry Parker\u2014they think I\u2019ve been away on a\r\ntrek up country, but any day they may put two and two together\u2014and\r\nthen the blow will fall. You\u2019re so young, Anne, and so beautiful\u2014with\r\nthe kind of beauty that sends men mad. All the world\u2019s before\r\nyou\u2014love, life, everything. Mine\u2019s behind me\u2014scorched, spoiled,\r\nwith a taste of bitter ashes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want me\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know I want you. You know that I\u2019d give my soul to pick you\r\nup in my arms and keep you here, hidden away from the world, for\r\never and ever. And you\u2019re tempting me, Anne. You, with your long\r\nwitch\u2019s hair, and your eyes that are golden and brown and green\r\nand never stop laughing even when your mouth is grave. But I\u2019ll\r\nsave you from yourself and from me. You shall go to-night. You\r\nshall go to Beira\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to Beira,\u201d I interrupted.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are. You shall go to Beira if I have to take you there myself\r\nand throw you on to the boat. What do you think I\u2019m made of? Do\r\nyou think I\u2019ll wake up night after night, fearing they\u2019ve got you?\r\nOne can\u2019t go on counting on miracles happening. You must go back\r\nto England, Anne\u2014and\u2014and marry and be happy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWith a steady man who\u2019ll give me a good home!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBetter that than\u2014utter disaster.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what of you?\u201d\r\n\r\nHis face grew grim and set.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got my work ready to hand. Don\u2019t ask what it is. You can\r\nguess, I dare say. But I\u2019ll tell you this\u2014I\u2019ll clear my name, or\r\ndie in the attempt, and I\u2019ll choke the life out of the damned\r\nscoundrel who did his best to murder you the other night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must be fair,\u201d I said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t actually push me over.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019d no need to. His plan was cleverer than that. I went up to\r\nthe path afterwards. Everything looked all right, but by the marks\r\non the ground I saw that the stones which outline the path had been\r\ntaken up and put down again in a slightly different place. There\r\nare tall bushes growing just over the edge. He\u2019d balanced the\r\noutside stones on them, so that you\u2019d think you were still on the\r\npath when in reality you were stepping into nothingness. God help\r\nhim if I lay my hands upon him!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe paused a minute and then said in a totally different tone:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never spoken of these things, Anne, have we? But the time\u2019s\r\ncome. I want you to hear the whole story\u2014from the beginning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf it hurts you to go over the past, don\u2019t tell me,\u201d I said in a\r\nlow voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I want you to know. I never thought I should speak of that\r\npart of my life to any one. Funny, isn\u2019t it, the tricks Fate\r\nplays?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a minute or two. The sun had set, and the velvety\r\ndarkness of the African night was enveloping us like a mantle.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome of it I know,\u201d I said gently.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know that your real name is Harry Lucas.\u201d\r\n\r\nStill he hesitated\u2014not looking at me, but staring straight out in\r\nfront of him. I had no clue as to what was passing in his mind,\r\nbut at last he jerked his head forward as though acquiescing in\r\nsome unspoken decision of his own and began his story.\r\n\n\u201cYou are right. My real name is Harry Lucas. My father was a\r\nretired soldier who came out to farm in Rhodesia. He died when I\r\nwas in my second year at Cambridge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWere you fond of him?\u201d I asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2014don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen he flushed and went on with sudden vehemence:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy do I say that? I _did_ love my father. We said bitter things\r\nto each other the last time I saw him, and we had many rows over\r\nmy wildness and my debts, but I cared for the old man. I know how\r\nmuch now\u2014when it\u2019s too late,\u201d he continued more quietly. \u201cIt was\r\nat Cambridge that I met the other fellow\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYoung Eardsley?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014young Eardsley. His father, as you know, was one of South\r\nAfrica\u2019s most prominent men. We drifted together at once, my friend\r\nand I. We had our love of South Africa in common and we both had\r\na taste for the untrodden places of the world. After he left\r\nCambridge, Eardsley had a final quarrel with his father. The old\r\nman had paid his debts twice, he refused to do so again. There was\r\na bitter scene between them. Sir Laurence declared himself at the\r\nend of his patience\u2014he would do no more for his son. He must stand\r\non his own legs for a while. The result was, as you know, that\r\nthose two young men went off to South America together, prospecting\r\nfor diamonds. I\u2019m not going into that now, but we had a wonderful\r\ntime out there. Hardships in plenty, you understand, but it was a\r\ngood life\u2014a hand-to-mouth scramble for existence far from the\r\nbeaten track\u2014and, my God! that\u2019s the place to know a friend. There\r\nwas a bond forged between us two out there that only death could\r\nhave broken. Well, as Colonel Race told you, our efforts were\r\ncrowned with success. We found a second Kimberley in the heart of\r\nthe British Guiana jungles. I can\u2019t tell you our elation. It wasn\u2019t\r\nso much the actual value in money of the find\u2014you see, Eardsley\r\nwas used to money, and he knew that when his father died he would\r\nbe a millionaire, and Lucas had always been poor and was used to\r\nit. No, it was the sheer delight of discovery.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe paused, and then added, almost apologetically:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mind my telling it this way, do you? As though I wasn\u2019t\r\nin it at all. It seems like that now when I look back and see those\r\ntwo boys. I almost forget that one of them was\u2014Harry Rayburn.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTell it any way you like,\u201d I said, and he went on:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe came to Kimberley\u2014very cock-a-hoop over our find. We brought\r\na magnificent selection of diamonds with us to submit to the\r\nexperts. And then\u2014in the hotel at Kimberley\u2014we met her\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nI stiffened a little, and the hand that rested on the doorpost\r\nclenched itself involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnita Gr\u00fcnberg\u2014that was her name. She was an actress. Quite young\r\nand very beautiful. She was South African born, but her mother was\r\na Hungarian, I believe. There was some sort of mystery about her,\r\nand that, of course, heightened her attraction for two boys home\r\nfrom the wilds. She must have had an easy task. We both fell for\r\nher right away, and we both took it hard. It was the first shadow\r\nthat had ever come between us\u2014but even then it didn\u2019t weaken our\r\nfriendship. Each of us, I honestly believe, was willing to stand\r\naside for the other to go in and win. But that wasn\u2019t her game.\r\nSometimes, afterwards, I wondered why it hadn\u2019t been, for Sir\r\nLaurence Eardsley\u2019s only son was quite a _parti._ But the truth of\r\nit was that she was married\u2014to a sorter in De Beers\u2019\u2014though nobody\r\nknew of it. She pretended enormous interests in our discovery, and\r\nwe told her all about it and even showed her the diamonds.\r\nDelilah\u2014that\u2019s what she should have been called\u2014and she played her\r\npart well!\r\n\r\n\u201cThe De Beers robbery was discovered, and like a thunderclap the\r\npolice came down upon us. They seized our diamonds. We only laughed\r\nat first\u2014the whole thing was so absurd. And then the diamonds were\r\nproduced in court\u2014and without question they were the stones stolen\r\nfrom De Beers\u2019. Anita Gr\u00fcnberg had disappeared. She had effected\r\nthe substitution neatly enough, and our story that these were not\r\nthe stones originally in our possession was laughed to scorn.\r\n\r\n\u201cSir Laurence Eardsley had enormous influence. He succeeded in\r\ngetting the case dismissed\u2014but it left two young men ruined and\r\ndisgraced to face the world with the stigma of thief attached to\r\ntheir names, and it pretty well broke the old fellow\u2019s heart. He\r\nhad one bitter interview with his son in which he heaped upon him\r\nevery reproach imaginable. He had done what he could to save the\r\nfamily name, but from that day on his son was his son no longer.\r\nHe cast him off utterly. And the boy, like the proud young fool\r\nthat he was, remained silent, disdaining to protest his innocence\r\nin the face of his father\u2019s disbelief. He came out furious from\r\nthe interview\u2014his friend was waiting for him. A week later war was\r\ndeclared. The two friends enlisted together. You know what happened.\r\nThe best pal a man ever had was killed, partly through his own mad\r\nrecklessness in rushing into unnecessary danger. He died with his\r\nname tarnished. . . .\r\n\r\n\u201cI swear to you, Anne, that it was mainly on his account that I\r\nwas so bitter against that woman. It had gone deeper with him than\r\nwith me. I had been madly in love with her for the moment\u2014I even\r\nthink that I frightened her sometimes\u2014but with him it was a quieter\r\nand deeper feeling. She had been the very centre of his universe\u2014and\r\nher betrayal of him tore up the very roots of life. The blow\r\nstunned him and left him paralyzed.\u201d\r\n\r\nHarry paused. After a minute or two he went on:\r\n\r\n\u201cAs you know, I was reported \u2018Missing, presumed killed.\u2019 I never\r\ntroubled to correct the mistake. I took the name of Parker and came\r\nto this island, which I knew of old. At the beginning of the war,\r\nI had had ambitious hopes of proving my innocence, but now all that\r\nspirit seemed dead. All I felt was, \u2018What\u2019s the good?\u2019 My pal was\r\ndead, neither he nor I had any living relations who would care. I\r\nwas supposed to be dead too, let it remain at that. I led a peaceful\r\nexistence here, neither happy nor unhappy\u2014numbed of all feeling.\r\nI see now, though I did not realize it at the time, that that was\r\npartly the effect of the war.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then one day something occurred to wake me right up again. I\r\nwas taking a party of people in my boat on a trip up the river,\r\nand I was standing at the landing-stage, helping them in, when one\r\nof the men uttered a startled exclamation. It focused my attention\r\non him. He was a small, thin man with a beard, and he was staring\r\nat me for all he was worth as though I was a ghost. So powerful\r\nwas his emotion that it awakened my curiosity. I made inquiries\r\nabout him at the hotel and learned that his name was Carton, that\r\nhe came from Kimberley, and that he was a diamond-sorter employed\r\nby De Beers\u2019. In a minute all the old sense of wrong surged over\r\nme again. I left the island and went to Kimberley.\r\n\r\n\u201cI could find out little more about him, however. In the end, I\r\ndecided that I must force an interview. I took my revolver with\r\nme. In the brief glimpse I had had of him, I had realized that he\r\nwas a physical coward. No sooner were we face to face than I\r\nrecognized that he was afraid of me. I soon forced him to tell me\r\nall he knew. He had engineered part of the robbery and Anita\r\nGr\u00fcnberg was his wife. He had once caught sight of both of us when\r\nwe were dining with her at the hotel, and, having read that I was\r\nkilled, my appearance in the flesh at the Falls had startled him\r\nbadly. He and Anita had married quite young, but she had soon\r\ndrifted away from him. She had got in with a bad lot, he told\r\nme\u2014and it was then for the first time that I heard of the \u2018Colonel.\u2019\r\nCarton himself had never been mixed up in anything except this one\r\naffair\u2014so he solemnly assured me, and I was inclined to believe\r\nhim. He was emphatically not of the stuff of which successful\r\ncriminals are made.\r\n\r\n\u201cI still had the feeling that he was keeping back something. As a\r\ntest, I threatened to shoot him there and then, declaring that I\r\ncared very little what became of me now. In a frenzy of terror he\r\npoured out a further story. It seems that Anita Gr\u00fcnberg did not\r\nquite trust the \u2018Colonel.\u2019 Whilst pretending to hand over to him\r\nthe stones she had taken from the hotel, she kept back some in her\r\nown possession. Carton advised her, with his technical knowledge,\r\nwhich to keep. If, at any time, these stones were produced, they\r\nwere of such colour and quality as to be readily identifiable, and\r\nthe experts at De Beers\u2019 would admit at once that these stones had\r\nnever passed through their hands. In this way my story of a\r\nsubstitution would be supported, my name would be cleared, and\r\nsuspicion would be diverted to the proper quarter. I gathered that,\r\ncontrary to his usual practice, the \u2018Colonel\u2019 himself had been\r\nconcerned in this affair, therefore Anita felt satisfied that she\r\nhad a real hold over him, should she need it. Carton now proposed\r\nthat I should make a bargain with Anita Gr\u00fcnberg, or Nadina, as\r\nshe now called herself. For a sufficient sum of money he thought\r\nthat she would be willing to give up the diamonds and betray her\r\nformer employer. He would cable to her immediately.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was still suspicious of Carton. He was a man whom it was easy\r\nenough to frighten, but who, in his fright, would tell so many lies\r\nthat to sift the truth out from them would be no easy job. I went\r\nback to the hotel and waited. By the following evening I judged\r\nthat he would have received the reply to his cable. I called round\r\nat his house and was told that Mr. Carton was away, but would be\r\nreturning on the morrow. Instantly I became suspicious. In the nick\r\nof time I found out that he was in reality sailing for England on\r\nthe _Kilmorden Castle,_ which left Cape Town in two days\u2019 time. I\r\nhad just time to journey down and catch the same boat.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had no intention of alarming Carton by revealing my presence on\r\nboard. I had done a good deal of acting in my time at Cambridge,\r\nand it was comparatively easy for me to transform myself into a\r\ngrave bearded gentleman of middle age. I avoided Carton carefully\r\non board the boat, keeping to my own cabin as far as possible under\r\nthe pretence of illness.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had no difficulty in trailing him when we got to London. He went\r\nstraight to an hotel and did not go out until the following day.\r\nHe left the hotel shortly before one o\u2019clock. I was behind him. He\r\nwent straight to a house-agent in Knightsbridge. There he asked\r\nfor particulars of houses to let on the river.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was at the next table also inquiring about houses. Then suddenly\r\nin walked Anita Gr\u00fcnberg, Nadina\u2014whatever you like to call her.\r\nSuperb, insolent, and almost as beautiful as ever. God! how I hated\r\nher. There she was, the woman who had ruined my life\u2014and who had\r\nalso ruined a better life than mine. At that minute I could have\r\nput my hands round her neck and squeezed the life out of her inch\r\nby inch! Just for a minute or two I saw red. I hardly took in what\r\nthe agent was saying. It was her voice that I heard next, high and\r\nclear, with an exaggerated foreign accent: \u2018The Mill House, Marlow.\r\nThe property of Sir Eustace Pedler. That sounds as though it might\r\nsuit me. At any rate, I will go and see it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThe man wrote her an order, and she walked out again in her regal\r\ninsolent manner. Not by word or a sign had she recognized Carton,\r\nyet I was sure that their meeting there was a preconceived plan.\r\nThen I started to jump to conclusions. Not knowing that Sir Eustace\r\nwas at Cannes, I thought that this house-hunting business was a\r\nmere pretext for meeting him in the Mill House. I knew that he had\r\nbeen in South Africa at the time of the robbery, and never having\r\nseen him I immediately leaped to the conclusion that he himself\r\nwas the mysterious \u2018Colonel\u2019 of whom I had heard so much.\r\n\r\n\u201cI followed my two suspects along Knightsbridge. Nadina went into\r\nthe Hyde Park Hotel. I quickened my pace and went in also. She\r\nwalked straight into the restaurant, and I decided that I would\r\nnot risk her recognizing me at the moment, but would continue to\r\nfollow Carton. I was in great hopes that he was going to get the\r\ndiamonds, and that by suddenly appearing and making myself known\r\nto him when he least expected it I might startle the truth out of\r\nhim. I followed him down into the Tube station at Hyde Park Corner.\r\nHe was standing by himself at the end of the platform. There was\r\nsome girl standing near, but no one else. I decided that I would\r\naccost him then and there. You know what happened. In the sudden\r\nshock of seeing a man whom he imagined far away in South Africa,\r\nhe lost his head and stepped back upon the line. He was always a\r\ncoward. Under the pretext of being a doctor, I managed to search\r\nhis pockets. There was a wallet with some notes in it and one or\r\ntwo unimportant letters, there was a roll of films\u2014which I must\r\nhave dropped somewhere later\u2014and there was a piece of paper with\r\nan appointment made on it for the 22nd on the _Kilmorden_ Castle.\r\nIn my haste to get away before any one detained me, I dropped that\r\nalso, but fortunately I remembered the figures.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hurried to the nearest cloak-room and hastily removed my make-up.\r\nI did not want to be laid by the heels for picking a dead man\u2019s\r\npocket. Then I retraced my steps to the Hyde Park Hotel. Nadina\r\nwas still having lunch. I needn\u2019t describe in detail how I followed\r\nher down to Marlow. She went into the house, and I spoke to the\r\nwoman at the lodge, pretending that I was with her. Then I, too,\r\nwent in.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stopped. There was a tense silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will believe me, Anne, won\u2019t you? I swear before God that what\r\nI am going to say is true. I went into the house after her with\r\nsomething very like murder in my heart\u2014and she was dead! I found\r\nher in that first-floor room\u2014God! It was horrible. Dead\u2014and I was\r\nnot more than three minutes behind her. And there was no sign of\r\nany one else in the house! Of course I realized at once the terrible\r\nposition I was in. By one master-stroke the blackmailed had rid\r\nhimself of the blackmailer, and at the same time had provided a\r\nvictim to whom the crime would be ascribed. The hand of the\r\n\u2018Colonel\u2019 was very plain. For the second time I was to be his\r\nvictim. Fool that I had been to walk into the trap so easily.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hardly know what I did next. I managed to go out of the place\r\nlooking fairly normal, but I knew that it could not be long before\r\nthe crime was discovered and a description of my appearance\r\ntelegraphed all over the country.\r\n\r\n\u201cI lay low for some days, not daring to make a move. In the end\r\nchance came to my aid. I overheard a conversation between two\r\nmiddle-aged gentlemen in the street, one of whom proved to be Sir\r\nEustace Pedler. I at once conceived the idea of attaching myself\r\nto him as his secretary. The fragment of conversation I had\r\noverheard gave me my clue. I was now no longer so sure that Sir\r\nEustace Pedler was the \u2018Colonel.\u2019 His house might have been\r\nappointed as a rendezvous by accident, or for some obscure motive\r\nthat I had not fathomed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know,\u201d I interrupted, \u201cthat Guy Pagett was in Marlow at\r\nthe date of the murder?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat settles it then. I thought he was at Cannes with Sir Eustace.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was supposed to be in Florence\u2014but he certainly never went\r\n_there._ I\u2019m pretty certain he was really in Marlow, but of course\r\nI can\u2019t prove it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd to think I never suspected Pagett for a minute until the night\r\nhe tried to throw you overboard. The man\u2019s a marvellous actor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat explains why the Mill House was chosen. Pagett could probably\r\nget in and out of it unobserved. Of course he made no objection to\r\nmy accompanying Sir Eustace across in the boat. He didn\u2019t want me\r\nlaid by the heels immediately. You see, evidently Nadina didn\u2019t\r\nbring the jewels with her to the rendezvous as they had counted on\r\nher doing. I fancy that Carton really had them and concealed them\r\nsomewhere on the _Kilmorden Castle_\u2014that\u2019s where he came in. They\r\nhoped that I might have some clue as to where they were hidden. As\r\nlong as the \u2018Colonel\u2019 did not recover the diamonds, he was still\r\nin danger\u2014hence his anxiety to get them at all costs. Where the\r\ndevil Carton hid them\u2014if he did hide them, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s another story,\u201d I quoted. _\u201cMy_ story. And I\u2019m going to\r\ntell it you now.\u201d\r\n\nHarry listened attentively whilst I recounted all the events that\r\nI have narrated in these pages. The thing that bewildered and\r\nastonished him most was to find that all along the diamonds had\r\nbeen in my possession\u2014or rather in Suzanne\u2019s. That was a fact he\r\nhad never suspected. Of course, after hearing his story, I realized\r\nthe point of Carton\u2019s little arrangement\u2014or rather Nadina\u2019s, since\r\nI had no doubt that it was her brain which had conceived the plan.\r\nNo surprise tactics executed against her or her husband could\r\nresult in the seizure of the diamonds. The secret was locked in\r\nher own brain, and the \u201cColonel\u201d was not likely to guess that they\r\nhad been entrusted to the keeping of an ocean steward!\r\n\r\nHarry\u2019s vindication from the old charge of theft seemed assured.\r\nIt was the other, graver charge that paralyzed all our activities.\r\nFor, as things stood, he could not come out in the open to prove\r\nhis case.\r\n\r\nThe one thing we came back to, again and again, was the identity\r\nof the \u201cColonel.\u201d Was he, or was he not, Guy Pagett?\r\n\r\n\u201cI should say he was but for one thing,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt seems\r\npretty much of a certainty that it was Pagett who murdered Anita\r\nGr\u00fcnberg at Marlow\u2014and that certainly lends colour to the\r\nsupposition that he is actually the \u2018Colonel,\u2019 since Anita\u2019s\r\nbusiness was not of the nature to be discussed with a subordinate.\r\nNo\u2014the only thing that militates against that theory is the attempt\r\nto put you out of the way on the night of your arrival here. You\r\nsaw Pagett left behind at Cape Town\u2014by no possible means could he\r\nhave arrived here before the following Wednesday. He is unlikely\r\nto have any emissaries in this part of the world, and all his plans\r\nwere laid to deal with you in Cape Town. He might, of course, have\r\ncabled instructions to some lieutenant of his in Johannesburg, who\r\ncould have joined the Rhodesian train at Mafeking, but his\r\ninstructions would have had to be particularly definite to allow\r\nof that note being written.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe sat silent for a moment, then Harry went on slowly: \u201cYou say\r\nthat Mrs. Blair was asleep when you left the hotel and that you\r\nheard Sir Eustace dictating to Miss Pettigrew? Where was Colonel\r\nRace?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI could not find him anywhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHad he any reason to believe that\u2014you and I might be friendly with\r\neach other?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe might have had,\u201d I answered thoughtfully, remembering our\r\nconversation on the way back from the Matoppos. \u201cHe\u2019s a very\r\npowerful personality,\u201d I continued, \u201cbut not at all my idea of the\r\n\u2018Colonel.\u2019 And, anyway, such an idea would be absurd. He\u2019s in the\r\nSecret Service.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do we know that he is? It\u2019s the easiest thing in the world to\r\nthrow out a hint of that kind. No one contradicts it, and the\r\nrumour spreads until every one believes it as gospel truth. It\r\nprovides an excuse for all sorts of doubtful doings. Anne, do you\r\nlike Race?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do\u2014and I don\u2019t. He repels me and at the same time fascinates\r\nme; but I know one thing, I\u2019m always a little afraid of him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was in South Africa, you know, at the time of the Kimberley\r\nrobbery,\u201d said Harry slowly.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it was he who told Suzanne all about the \u2018Colonel\u2019 and how he\r\nhad been in Paris trying to get on his track.\u201d\r\n\r\n_\u201cCamouflage_\u2014of a particularly clever kind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut where does Pagett come in? Is he in Race\u2019s pay?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d said Harry slowly, \u201che doesn\u2019t come in at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThink back, Anne. Did you ever hear Pagett\u2019s own account of that\r\nnight on the _Kilmorden?\u201d_\r\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014through Sir Eustace.\u201d\r\n\r\nI repeated it. Harry listened closely.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe saw a man coming from the direction of Sir Eustace\u2019s cabin and\r\nfollowed him up on deck. Is that what he says? Now, who had the\r\ncabin opposite to Sir Eustace? Colonel Race. Supposing Colonel Race\r\ncrept up on deck, and, foiled in his attack on you, fled round the\r\ndeck and met Pagett just coming through the saloon door. He knocks\r\nhim down and springs inside, closing the door. We dash round and\r\nfind Pagett lying there. How\u2019s that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou forget that he declares positively it was you who knocked him\r\ndown.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, suppose that just as he regains consciousness he sees me\r\ndisappearing in the distance? Wouldn\u2019t he take it for granted that\r\nI was his assailant? Especially as he thought all along it was I\r\nhe was following?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible, yes,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cBut it alters all our ideas.\r\nAnd there are other things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMost of them are open to explanation. The man who followed you in\r\nCape Town spoke to Pagett, and Pagett looked at his watch. The man\r\nmight have merely asked him the time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was just a coincidence, you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot exactly. There\u2019s a method in all this, connecting Pagett with\r\nthe affair. Why was the Mill House chosen for the murder? Was it\r\nbecause Pagett had been in Kimberley when the diamonds were stolen?\r\nWould _he_ have been made the scapegoat if I had not appeared so\r\nprovidentially upon the scene?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you think he may be entirely innocent?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt looks like it, but, if so, we\u2019ve got to find out what he was\r\ndoing in Marlow. If he\u2019s got a reasonable explanation of that,\r\nwe\u2019re on the right tack.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe got up.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s past midnight. Turn in, Anne, and get some sleep. Just before\r\ndawn I\u2019ll take you over in the boat. You must catch the train at\r\nLivingstone. I\u2019ve got a friend there who will keep you hidden away\r\nuntil the train starts. You go to Bulawayo and catch the Beira\r\ntrain there. I can find out from my friend in Livingstone what\u2019s\r\ngoing on at the hotel and where your friends are now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBeira,\u201d I said meditatively.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Anne, it\u2019s Beira for you. This is man\u2019s work. Leave it to\r\nme.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had had a momentary respite from emotion whilst we talked the\r\nsituation out, but it was on us again now. We did not even look at\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d I said, and passed into the hut.\r\n\r\nI lay down on the skin-covered couch, but I didn\u2019t sleep, and\r\noutside I could hear Harry Rayburn pacing up and down, up and down\r\nthrough the long dark hours. At last he called me:\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, Anne, it\u2019s time to go.\u201d\r\n\r\nI got up and came out obediently. It was still quite dark, but I\r\nknew that dawn was not far off.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take the canoe, not the motor-boat\u2014\u2014\u201d Harry began, when\r\nsuddenly he stopped dead and held up his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cHush! What\u2019s that?\u201d\r\n\r\nI listened, but could hear nothing. His ears were sharper than\r\nmine, however, the ears of a man who has lived long in the\r\nwilderness. Presently I heard it too\u2014the faint splash of paddles\r\nin the water coming from the direction of the right bank of the\r\nriver and rapidly approaching our little landing-stage.\r\n\r\nWe strained our eyes in the darkness, and could make out a dark\r\nblur on the surface of the water. It was a boat. Then there was a\r\nmomentary spurt of flame. Some one had struck a match. By its light\r\nI recognized one figure, the red-bearded Dutchman of the villa at\r\nMuizenberg. The others were natives.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuick\u2014back to the hut.\u201d\r\n\r\nHarry swept me back with him. He took down a couple of rifles and\r\na revolver from the wall.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you load a rifle?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never have. Show me how.\u201d\r\n\r\nI grasped his instructions well enough. We closed the door and\r\nHarry stood by the window which overlooked the landing-stage. The\r\nboat was just about to run alongside it.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d called out Harry in a ringing voice.\r\n\r\nAny doubt we might have had as to our visitors\u2019 intentions was\r\nswiftly resolved. A hail of bullets splattered round us. Fortunately\r\nneither of us was hit. Harry raised the rifle. It spat murderously,\r\nand again and again. I heard two groans and a splash.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s given \u2019em something to think about,\u201d he muttered grimly,\r\nas he reached for the second rifle. \u201cStand well back, Anne, for\r\nGod\u2019s sake. And load quickly.\u201d\r\n\r\nMore bullets. One just grazed Harry\u2019s cheek. His answering fire\r\nwas more deadly than theirs. I had the rifle reloaded when he\r\nturned for it. He caught me close with his left arm and kissed me\r\nonce savagely before he turned to the window again. Suddenly he\r\nuttered a shout.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re going\u2014had enough of it. They\u2019re a good mark out there on\r\nthe water, and they can\u2019t see how many of us there are. They\u2019re\r\nrouted for the moment\u2014but they\u2019ll come back. We\u2019ll have to get\r\nready for them.\u201d He flung down the rifle and turned to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnne! You beauty! You wonder! You little queen! As brave as a\r\nlion. Black-haired witch!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe caught me in his arms. He kissed my hair, my eyes, my mouth.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now to business,\u201d he said, suddenly releasing me. \u201cGet out\r\nthose tins of paraffin.\u201d\r\n\r\nI did as I was told. He was busy inside the hut. Presently I saw\r\nhim on the roof of the hut, crawling along with something in his\r\narms. He rejoined me in a minute or two.\r\n\r\n\u201cGo down to the boat. We\u2019ll have to carry it across the island to\r\nthe other side.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe picked up the paraffin as I disappeared.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming back,\u201d I called softly. I had seen the blur moving\r\nout from the opposite shore.\r\n\r\nHe ran down to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust in time. Why\u2014where the hell\u2019s the boat?\u201d Both had been cut\r\nadrift. Harry whistled softly. \u201cWe\u2019re in a tight place, honey.\r\nMind?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, but dying together\u2019s not much fun. We\u2019ll do better than that.\r\nSee\u2014they\u2019ve got two boat-loads this time. Going to land at two\r\ndifferent points. Now for my little scenic effect.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlmost as he spoke a long flame shot up from the hut. Its light\r\nilluminated two crouching figures huddled together on the roof.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy old clothes\u2014stuffed with rags\u2014but they won\u2019t tumble to it for\r\nsome time. Come, Anne, we\u2019ve got to try desperate means.\u201d\r\n\r\nHand in hand, we raced across the island. Only a narrow channel of\r\nwater divided it from the shore on that side.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to swim for it. Can you swim at all, Anne? Not that it\r\nmatters. I can get you across. It\u2019s the wrong side for a boat\u2014\u2014too\r\nmany rocks, but the right side for swimming, and the right side\r\nfor Livingstone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can swim a little\u2014farther than that. What\u2019s the danger, Harry?\u201d\r\nFor I had seen the grim look on his face. \u201cSharks?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, you little goose. Sharks live in the sea. But you\u2019re sharp,\r\nAnne. Crocs, that\u2019s the trouble.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCrocodiles?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, don\u2019t think of them\u2014or say your prayers, whichever you feel\r\ninclined.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe plunged in. My prayers must have been efficacious, for we\r\nreached the shore without adventure, and drew ourselves up wet and\r\ndripping on the bank.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow for Livingstone. It\u2019s rough going, I\u2019m afraid, and wet clothes\r\nwon\u2019t make it any better. But it\u2019s got to be done.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat walk was a nightmare. My wet skirts flapped round my legs,\r\nand my stockings were soon torn off by the thorns. Finally I\r\nstopped, utterly exhausted. Harry came back to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cHold up, honey. I\u2019ll carry you for a bit.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat was the way I came into Livingstone, slung across his shoulder\r\nlike a sack of coals. How he did it for all that way, I don\u2019t know.\r\nThe first faint light of dawn was just breaking. Harry\u2019s friend\r\nwas a young man of twenty odd who kept a store of native curios.\r\nHis name was Ned\u2014perhaps he had another, but I never heard it. He\r\ndidn\u2019t seem in the least surprised to see Harry walk in, dripping\r\nwet, holding an equally dripping female by the hand. Men are very\r\nwonderful.\r\n\r\nHe gave us food to eat, and hot coffee, and got our clothes dried\r\nfor us whilst we rolled ourselves in Manchester blankets of gaudy\r\nhue. In the tiny back room of the hut we were safe from observation\r\nwhilst he departed to make judicious inquiries as to what had\r\nbecome of Sir Eustace\u2019s party, and whether any of them were still\r\nat the hotel.\r\n\r\nIt was then that I informed Harry that nothing would induce me to\r\ngo to Beira. I never meant to, anyway, but now all reason for such\r\nproceedings had vanished. The point of the plan had been that my\r\nenemies believed me dead. Now that they knew I wasn\u2019t dead, my\r\ngoing to Beira would do no good whatever. They could easily follow\r\nme there and murder me quietly. I should have no one to protect\r\nme. It was finally arranged that I should join Suzanne, wherever\r\nshe was, and devote all my energies to taking care of myself. On\r\nno account was I to seek adventures or endeavour to checkmate the\r\n\u201cColonel.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was to remain quietly with her and await instructions from Harry.\r\nThe diamonds were to be deposited in the Bank at Kimberley under\r\nthe name of Parker.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s one thing,\u201d I said thoughtfully, \u201cwe ought to have a code\r\nof some kind. We don\u2019t want to be hoodwinked again by messages\r\npurporting to come from one to the other.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s easy enough. Any message that comes _genuinely_ from me\r\nwill have the word \u2018and\u2019 crossed out in it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWithout trade-mark, none genuine,\u201d I murmured. \u201cWhat about wires?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAny wires from me will be signed \u2018Andy.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrain will be in before long, Harry,\u201d said Ned, putting his head\r\nin and withdrawing it immediately.\r\n\r\nI stood up.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd shall I marry a nice steady man if I find one?\u201d I asked\r\ndemurely.\r\n\r\nHarry came close to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God! Anne, if you ever marry any one else but me, I\u2019ll wring\r\nhis neck. And as for you\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, pleasurably excited.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall carry you away and beat you black and blue!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a delightful husband I have chosen,\u201d I said satirically. \u201cAnd\r\ndoesn\u2019t he change his mind overnight!\u201d\r\n\n_(Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I remarked once before, I am essentially a man of peace. I yearn\r\nfor a quiet life\u2014and that\u2019s just the one thing I don\u2019t seem able\r\nto have. I am always in the middle of storms and alarms. The relief\r\nof getting away from Pagett with his incessant nosing out of\r\nintrigues was enormous, and Miss Pettigrew is certainly a useful\r\ncreature. Although there is nothing of the houri about her, one or\r\ntwo of her accomplishments are invaluable. It is true that I had\r\na touch of liver at Bulawayo and behaved like a bear in consequence,\r\nbut I had had a disturbed night in the train. At 3 a.m. an\r\nexquisitely dressed young man looking like a musical-comedy hero\r\nof the Wild West entered my compartment and asked where I was\r\ngoing. Disregarding my first murmur of \u201cTea\u2014and for God\u2019s sake\r\ndon\u2019t put sugar in it,\u201d he repeated his question, laying stress on\r\nthe fact that he was not a waiter but an Immigration officer. I\r\nfinally succeeded in satisfying him that I was suffering from no\r\ninfectious disease, that I was visiting Rhodesia from the purest\r\nof motives, and further gratified him with my full Christian names\r\nand my place of birth. I then endeavoured to snatch a little sleep,\r\nbut some officious ass aroused me at 5.30 with a cup of liquid\r\nsugar which he called tea. I don\u2019t think I threw it at him, but I\r\nknow that that was what I wanted to do. He brought me unsugared\r\ntea, stone cold, at 6, and I then fell asleep utterly exhausted,\r\nto awaken just outside Bulawayo and be landed with a beastly wooden\r\ngiraffe, all legs and neck!\r\n\r\nBut for these small contretemps, all had been going smoothly. And\r\nthen fresh calamity befell.\r\n\r\nIt was the night of our arrival at the Falls. I was dictating to\r\nMiss Pettigrew in my sitting-room, when suddenly Mrs. Blair burst\r\nin without a word of excuse and wearing most compromising attire.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Anne?\u201d she cried.\r\n\r\nA nice question to ask. As though I were responsible for the girl.\r\nWhat did she expect Miss Pettigrew to think? That I was in the\r\nhabit of producing Anne Beddingfeld from my pocket at midnight or\r\nthereabouts? Very compromising for a man in my position.\r\n\r\n\u201cI presume,\u201d I said coldly, \u201cthat she is in her bed.\u201d\r\n\r\nI cleared my throat and glanced at Miss Pettigrew, to show that I\r\nwas ready to resume dictating. I hoped Mrs. Blair would take the\r\nhint. She did nothing of the kind. Instead she sank into a chair\r\nand waved a slippered foot in an agitated manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not in her room. I\u2019ve been there. I had a dream\u2014a terrible\r\ndream\u2014that she was in some awful danger, and I got up and went to\r\nher room, just to reassure myself, you know. She wasn\u2019t there and\r\nher bed hadn\u2019t been slept in.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe looked at me appealingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall I do, Sir Eustace?\u201d\r\n\r\nRepressing the desire to reply, \u201cGo to bed, and don\u2019t worry over\r\nnothing. An able-bodied young woman like Anne Beddingfeld is\r\nperfectly well able to take care of herself,\u201d I frowned judicially.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat does Race say about it?\u201d\r\n\r\nWhy should Race have it all his own way? Let him have some of the\r\ndisadvantages as well as the advantages of female society.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t find him anywhere.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was evidently making a night of it. I sighed and sat down in\r\na chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t quite see the reason for your agitation,\u201d I said patiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dream\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat curry we had for dinner!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Sir Eustace!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe woman was quite indignant. And yet everybody knows that\r\nnightmares are a direct result of injudicious eating.\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter all,\u201d I continued persuasively, \u201cwhy shouldn\u2019t Anne\r\nBeddingfeld and Race go out for a little stroll without having the\r\nwhole hotel aroused about it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think they\u2019ve just gone out for a stroll together? But it\u2019s\r\nafter midnight!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne does these foolish things when one is young,\u201d I murmured,\r\n\u201cthough Race is certainly old enough to know better.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI dare say they\u2019ve run away to make a match of it,\u201d I continued\r\nsoothingly, though fully aware that I was making an idiotic\r\nsuggestion. For, after all, at a place like this, where is there\r\nto run away to?\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how much longer I should have gone on making feeble\r\nremarks, but at that moment Race himself walked in upon us. At any\r\nrate, I had been partly right\u2014_he_ had been out for a stroll, but\r\nhe hadn\u2019t taken Anne with him. However, I had been quite wrong in\r\nmy way of dealing with the situation. I was soon shown that. Race\r\nhad the whole hotel turned upside-down in three minutes. I\u2019ve never\r\nseen a man more upset.\r\n\r\nThe thing is very extraordinary. Where did the girl go? She walked\r\nout of the hotel, fully dressed, about ten minutes past eleven,\r\nand she was never seen again. The idea of suicide seems impossible.\r\nShe was one of those energetic young women who are in love with\r\nlife, and have not the faintest intention of quitting it. There\r\nwas no train either way until midday on the morrow, so she can\u2019t\r\nhave left the place. Then where the devil is she?\r\n\r\nRace is almost beside himself, poor fellow. He has left no stone\r\nunturned. All the D.C.\u2019s, or whatever they call themselves, for\r\nhundreds of miles round have been pressed into the service. The\r\nnative trackers have run about on all fours. Everything that can\r\nbe done is being done\u2014but no sign of Anne Beddingfeld. The accepted\r\ntheory is that she walked in her sleep. There are signs on the path\r\nnear the bridge which seem to show that the girl walked deliberately\r\noff the edge. If so, of course, she must have been dashed to pieces\r\non the rocks below. Unfortunately, most of the footprints were\r\nobliterated by a party of tourists who chose to walk that way early\r\non the Monday morning.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a very satisfactory theory. In my young\r\ndays, I always was told that sleep-walkers couldn\u2019t hurt\r\nthemselves\u2014that their own sixth sense took care of them. I don\u2019t\r\nthink the theory satisfies Mrs. Blair either.\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t make that woman out. Her whole attitude towards Race has\r\nchanged. She watches him now like a cat a mouse, and she makes\r\nobvious efforts to bring herself to be civil to him. And they used\r\nto be such friends. Altogether she is unlike herself, nervous,\r\nhysterical, starting and jumping at the least sound. I am beginning\r\nto think that it is high time I went to Jo\u2019burg.\r\n\r\nA rumour came along yesterday of a mysterious island somewhere up\r\nthe river, with a man and a girl on it. Race got very excited. It\r\nturned out to be all a mare\u2019s-nest, however. The man had been there\r\nfor years, and is well known to the manager of the hotel. He totes\r\nparties up and down the river in the season and points out\r\ncrocodiles and a stray hippopotamus or so to them. I believe that\r\nhe keeps a tame one which is trained to bite pieces out of the boat\r\non occasions. Then he fends it off with a boat-hook, and the party\r\nfeel they have really got to the back of beyond at last. How long\r\nthe girl has been there is not definitely known, but it seems\r\npretty clear that she can\u2019t be Anne, and there is a certain delicacy\r\nin interfering in other people\u2019s affairs. If I were this young\r\nfellow, I should certainly kick Race off the island if he came\r\nasking questions about my love affairs.\r\n\r\n_Later._\r\n\r\nIt is definitely settled that I go to Jo\u2019burg to-morrow. Race urges\r\nme to do so. Things are getting unpleasant there, by all I hear,\r\nbut I might as well go before they get worse. I dare say I shall\r\nbe shot by a striker, anyway. Mrs. Blair was to have accompanied\r\nme, but at the last minute she changed her mind and decided to stay\r\non at the Falls. It seems as though she couldn\u2019t bear to take her\r\neyes off Race. She came to me to-night and said, with some\r\nhesitation, that she had a favour to ask. Would I take charge of\r\nher souvenirs for her?\r\n\r\n\u201cNot the animals?\u201d I asked, in lively alarm. I always felt that I\r\nshould get stuck with those beastly animals sooner or later.\r\n\r\nIn the end we effected a compromise. I took charge of two small\r\nwooden boxes for her which contained fragile articles. The animals\r\nare to be packed by the local store in vast crates and sent to Cape\r\nTown by rail, where Pagett will see to their being stored.\r\n\r\nThe people who are packing them say that they are of a particularly\r\nawkward shape (!), and that special cases will have to be made. I\r\npointed out to Mrs. Blair that by the time she has got them home\r\nthose animals will have cost her easily a pound apiece!\r\n\r\nPagett is straining at the leash to rejoin me in Jo\u2019burg. I shall\r\nmake an excuse of Mrs. Blair\u2019s cases to keep him in Cape Town. I\r\nhave written him that he must receive the cases and see to their\r\nsafe disposal, as they contain rare curios of immense value.\r\n\r\nSo all is settled, and I and Miss Pettigrew go off into the blue\r\ntogether. And any one who has seen Miss Pettigrew will admit that\r\nit is perfectly respectable.\r\n\n  Johannesburg,\r\n\r\n  _March 6th._\r\n\r\nThere is something about the state of things here that is not at\r\nall healthy. To use the well-known phrase that I have so often\r\nread, we are all living on the edge of a volcano. Bands of strikers,\r\nor so-called strikers, patrol the streets and scowl at one in a\r\nmurderous fashion. They are picking out the bloated capitalists\r\nready for when the massacres begin, I suppose. You can\u2019t ride in\r\na taxi\u2014if you do, strikers pull you out again. And the hotels hint\r\npleasantly that when the food gives out they will fling you out on\r\nthe mat!\r\n\r\nI met Reeves, my labour friend of the _Kilmorden,_ last night. He\r\nhas cold feet worse than any man I ever saw. He\u2019s like all the rest\r\nof these people, they make inflammatory speeches of enormous\r\nlength, solely for political purposes, and then wish they hadn\u2019t.\r\nHe\u2019s busy now going about and saying he didn\u2019t really do it. When\r\nI met him, he was just off to Cape Town, where he meditates making\r\na three days\u2019 speech in Dutch, vindicating himself, and pointing\r\nout that the things he said really meant something entirely\r\ndifferent. I am thankful that I do not have to sit in the\r\nLegislative Assembly of South Africa. The House of Commons is bad\r\nenough, but at least we have only one language, and some slight\r\nrestriction as to length of speeches. When I went to the Assembly\r\nbefore leaving Cape Town, I listened to a gray-haired gentleman\r\nwith a drooping moustache who looked exactly like the Mock Turtle\r\nin _Alice in Wonderland._\r\n\r\nHe dropped out his words one by one in a particularly melancholy\r\nfashion. Every now and then he galvanized himself to further\r\nefforts by ejaculating something that sounded like \u201cPlatt Skeet,\u201d\r\nuttered _fortissimo_ and in marked contrast to the rest of his\r\ndelivery. When he did this, half his audience yelled \u201cWhoof,\r\nwhoof!\u201d which is possibly Dutch for \u201cHear, hear,\u201d and the other\r\nhalf woke up with a start from the pleasant nap they had been\r\nhaving. I was given to understand that the gentleman had been\r\nspeaking for at least three days. They must have a lot of patience\r\nin South Africa.\r\n\r\nI have invented endless jobs to keep Pagett in Cape Town, but at\r\nlast the fertility of my imagination has given out, and he joins\r\nme to-morrow in the spirit of the faithful dog who comes to die by\r\nhis master\u2019s side. And I was getting on so well with my Reminiscences\r\ntoo! I had invented some extraordinarily witty things that the\r\nstrike leaders said to me and I said to the strike leaders.\r\n\r\nThis morning I was interviewed by a Government official. He was\r\nurbane, persuasive and mysterious in turn. To begin with, he\r\nalluded to my exalted position and importance and suggested that\r\nI should remove myself, or be removed by him, to Pretoria.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou expect trouble, then?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\nHis reply was so worded as to have no meaning whatsoever, so I\r\ngathered that they were expecting serious trouble. I suggested to\r\nhim that his Government were letting things go rather far.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is such a thing as giving a man enough rope, and letting\r\nhim hang himself, Sir Eustace.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, quite so, quite so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not the strikers themselves who are causing the trouble.\r\nThere is some organization at work behind them. Arms and explosives\r\nhave been pouring in, and we have made a haul of certain documents\r\nwhich throw a good deal of light on the methods adopted to import\r\nthem. There is a regular code. Potatoes mean \u2018detonators,\u2019\r\ncauliflower, \u2018rifles,\u2019 other vegetables stand for various\r\nexplosives.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s very interesting,\u201d I commended.\r\n\r\n\u201cMore than that, Sir Eustace, we have every reason to believe that\r\nthe man who runs the whole show, the directing genius of the\r\naffair, is at this minute in Johannesburg.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stared at me so hard that I began to fear that he suspected me\r\nof being the man. I broke out into a cold perspiration at the\r\nthought, and began to regret that I had ever conceived the idea of\r\ninspecting a miniature revolution at first hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo trains are running from Jo\u2019burg to Pretoria,\u201d he continued.\r\n\u201cBut I can arrange to send you over by private car. In case you\r\nshould be stopped on the way I can provide you with two separate\r\npasses, one issued by the Union Government, and the other stating\r\nthat you are an English visitor who has nothing whatsoever to do\r\nwith the Union.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne for your people, and one for the strikers, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe project did not appeal to me\u2014I know what happens in a case of\r\nthat kind. You get flustered and mix the things up. I should hand\r\nthe wrong pass to the wrong person, and it would end in my being\r\nsummarily shot by a bloodthirsty rebel, or one of the supporters\r\nof law and order whom I notice guarding the streets wearing bowler\r\nhats and smoking pipes, with rifles tucked carelessly under their\r\narms. Besides, what should I do with myself in Pretoria? Admire\r\nthe architecture of the Union buildings and listen to the echoes\r\nof the shooting round Johannesburg? I should be penned up there\r\nGod knows how long. They\u2019ve blown up the railway line already, I\r\nhear. It isn\u2019t even as if one could get a drink there. They put\r\nthe place under martial law two days ago.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d I said, \u201cyou don\u2019t seem to realize that I\u2019m\r\nstudying conditions on the Rand. How the devil am I going to study\r\nthem from Pretoria? I appreciate your care for my safety, but don\u2019t\r\nyou worry about me. I shall be all right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI warn you, Sir Eustace, that the food question is already\r\nserious.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA little fasting will improve my figure,\u201d I said, with a sigh.\r\n\r\nWe were interrupted by a telegram being handed to me. I read it\r\nwith amazement:\r\n\r\n\u201cAnne is safe. Here with me at Kimberley. Suzanne Blair.\u201d\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think I ever really believed in the annihilation of Anne.\r\nThere is something peculiarly indestructible about that young\r\nwoman\u2014she is like the patent balls that one gives to terriers. She\r\nhas an extraordinary knack of turning up smiling. I still don\u2019t\r\nsee why it was necessary for her to walk out of the hotel in the\r\nmiddle of the night in order to get to Kimberley. There was no\r\ntrain, anyway. She must have put on a pair of angel\u2019s wings and\r\nflown there. And I don\u2019t suppose she will ever explain. Nobody\r\ndoes\u2014to me. I always have to guess. It becomes monotonous after a\r\nwhile. The exigencies of journalism are at the bottom of it, I\r\nsuppose. \u201cHow I shot the rapids,\u201d by our Special Correspondent.\r\n\r\nI refolded the telegram and got rid of my Governmental friend. I\r\ndon\u2019t like the prospect of being hungry, but I\u2019m not alarmed for\r\nmy personal safety. Smuts is perfectly capable of dealing with the\r\nrevolution. But I would give a considerable sum of money for a\r\ndrink! I wonder if Pagett will have the sense to bring a bottle of\r\nwhisky with him when he arrives to-morrow?\r\n\r\nI put on my hat and went out, intending to buy a few souvenirs.\r\nThe curio-shops in Jo\u2019burg are rather pleasant. I was just studying\r\na window full of imposing karosses, when a man coming out of the\r\nshop cannoned into me. To my surprise it turned out to be Race.\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t flatter myself that he looked pleased to see me. As a\r\nmatter of fact, he looked distinctly annoyed, but I insisted on\r\nhis accompanying me back to the hotel. I get tired of having no\r\none but Miss Pettigrew to talk to.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had no idea you were in Jo\u2019burg,\u201d I said chattily. \u201cWhen did\r\nyou arrive?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLast night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWith friends.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was disposed to be extraordinarily taciturn, and seemed to be\r\nembarrassed by my questions.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope they keep poultry,\u201d I remarked. \u201cA diet of new-laid eggs\r\nand the occasional slaughtering of an old cock will be decidedly\r\nagreeable soon from all I hear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d I said, when we were back in the hotel, \u201chave you\r\nheard that Miss Beddingfeld is alive and kicking?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe gave us quite a fright,\u201d I said airily. \u201cWhere the devil did\r\nshe go to that night, that\u2019s what I\u2019d like to know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was on the island all the time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich island? Not the one with the young man on it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow very improper,\u201d I said. \u201cPagett will be quite shocked. He\r\nalways did disapprove of Anne Beddingfeld. I suppose that was the\r\nyoung man she originally intended to meet in Durban?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me anything you don\u2019t want to,\u201d I said, by way of\r\nencouraging him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI fancy that this is a young man we should all be very glad to\r\nlay our hands on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot\u2014\u2014?\u201d I cried, in rising excitement.\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cHarry Rayburn, _alias_ Harry Lucas\u2014that\u2019s his real name, you know.\r\nHe\u2019s given us all the slip once more, but we\u2019re bound to rope him\r\nin soon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me, dear me,\u201d I murmured.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t suspect the girl of complicity in any case. On her side\r\nit\u2019s\u2014just a love-affair.\u201d\r\n\r\nI always did think Race was in love with Anne. The way he said\r\nthose last words made me feel sure of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s gone to Beira,\u201d he continued rather hastily.\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d I said, staring. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe wrote to me from Bulawayo, telling me she was going home that\r\nway. The best thing she can do, poor child.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSomehow, I don\u2019t fancy she is in Beira,\u201d I said meditatively.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was just starting when she wrote.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was puzzled. Somebody was clearly lying. Without stopping to\r\nreflect that Anne might have excellent reasons for her misleading\r\nstatements, I gave myself up to the pleasure of scoring off Race.\r\nHe is always so cocksure. I took the telegram from my pocket and\r\nhanded it to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen how do you explain this?\u201d I asked nonchalantly.\r\n\r\nHe seemed dumbfounded.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe said she was just starting for Beira,\u201d he said, in a dazed\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nI know that Race is supposed to be clever. He is, in my opinion,\r\nrather a stupid man. It never seemed to occur to him that girls do\r\nnot always tell the truth.\r\n\r\n\u201cKimberley too. What are they doing there?\u201d he muttered.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that surprised me. I should have thought Miss Anne would have\r\nbeen in the thick of it here, gathering copy for the _Daily\r\nBudget.\u201d_\r\n\r\n\u201cKimberley,\u201d he said again. The place seemed to upset him. \u201cThere\u2019s\r\nnothing to see there\u2014the pits aren\u2019t being worked.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know what women are,\u201d I said vaguely.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head and went off. I have evidently given him something\r\nto think about.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he departed than my Government official reappeared.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope you will forgive me for troubling you again, Sir Eustace,\u201d\r\nhe apologized. \u201cBut there are one or two questions I should like\r\nto ask you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, my dear fellow,\u201d I said cheerfully. \u201cAsk away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt concerns your secretary\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know nothing about him,\u201d I said hastily. \u201cHe foisted himself\r\nupon me in London, robbed me of valuable papers\u2014for which I shall\r\nbe hauled over the coals\u2014and disappeared like a conjuring trick at\r\nCape Town. It\u2019s true that I was at the Falls at the same time as\r\nhe was, but I was at the hotel, and he was on an island. I can\r\nassure you that I never set eyes upon him the whole time that I\r\nwas there.\u201d\r\n\r\nI paused for breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou misunderstand me. It was of your other secretary that I\r\nspoke.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat? Pagett?\u201d I cried, in lively astonishment. \u201cHe\u2019s been with\r\nme eight years\u2014a most trustworthy fellow.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy interlocutor smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are still at cross-purposes. I refer to the lady.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Pettigrew?\u201d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. She has been seen coming out of Agrasato\u2019s Native Curio-shop.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGod bless my soul!\u201d I interrupted. \u201cI was going into that place\r\nmyself this afternoon. You might have caught _me_ coming out!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any innocent thing that one can do in\r\nJo\u2019burg without being suspected for it.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! but she has been there more than once\u2014and in rather doubtful\r\ncircumstances. I may as well tell you\u2014in confidence, Sir Eustace\u2014that\r\nthe place is suspected of being a well-known rendezvous used by\r\nthe secret organization behind this revolution. That is why I\r\nshould be glad to hear all that you can tell me about this lady.\r\nWhere and how did you come to engage her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was lent to me,\u201d I replied coldly, \u201cby your own Government.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe collapsed utterly.\r\n\n_(Anne\u2019s Narrative Resumed)_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as I got to Kimberley I wired to Suzanne.\r\n\r\nShe joined me there with the utmost dispatch, heralding her arrival\r\nwith telegrams sent off _en route._ I was awfully surprised to find\r\nthat she really was fond of me\u2014I thought I had been just a new\r\nsensation, but she positively fell on my neck and wept when we met.\r\n\r\nWhen we had recovered from our emotion a little, I sat down on the\r\nbed and told her the whole story from A to Z.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou always did suspect Colonel Race,\u201d she said thoughtfully, when\r\nI had finished. \u201cI didn\u2019t until the night you disappeared. I liked\r\nhim so much all along and thought he would make such a nice husband\r\nfor you. Oh, Anne, dear, don\u2019t be cross, but how do you know that\r\nthis young man of yours is telling the truth? You believe every\r\nword he says.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course I do,\u201d I cried indignantly.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what is there in him that attracts you so? I don\u2019t see that\r\nthere\u2019s anything in him at all except his rather reckless good\r\nlooks and his modern Sheik-cum-Stone-Age love-making.\u201d\r\n\r\nI poured out the vials of my wrath upon Suzanne for some minutes.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust because you\u2019re comfortably married and getting fat, you\u2019ve\r\nforgotten that there\u2019s any such thing as romance,\u201d I ended.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not getting fat, Anne. All the worry I\u2019ve had about you\r\nlately must have worn me to a shred.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou look particularly well nourished,\u201d I said coldly. \u201cI should\r\nsay you must have put on about half a stone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m so comfortably married either,\u201d continued\r\nSuzanne in a melancholy voice. \u201cI\u2019ve been having the most dreadful\r\ncables from Clarence ordering me to come home at once. At last I\r\ndidn\u2019t answer them, and now I haven\u2019t heard for over a fortnight.\u201d\r\n\r\nI\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t take Suzanne\u2019s matrimonial troubles very\r\nseriously. She will be able to get round Clarence all right when\r\nthe times comes. I turned the conversation to the subject of the\r\ndiamonds.\r\n\r\nSuzanne looked at me with a dropped jaw.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must explain, Anne. You see, as soon as I began to suspect\r\nColonel Race, I was terribly upset about the diamonds. I wanted to\r\nstay on at the Falls in case he might have kidnapped you somewhere\r\nclose by, but didn\u2019t know what to do about the diamonds. I was\r\nafraid to keep them in my possession\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nSuzanne looked round her uneasily, as though she feared the walls\r\nmight have ears, and then whispered vehemently in my ear.\r\n\r\n\u201cA distinctly good idea,\u201d I approved. \u201cAt the time, that is. It\u2019s\r\na bit awkward now. What did Sir Eustace do with the cases?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe big ones were sent down to Cape Town. I heard from Pagett\r\nbefore I left the Falls, and he enclosed the receipt for their\r\nstorage. He\u2019s leaving Cape Town to-day, by the by, to join Sir\r\nEustace in Johannesburg.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d I said thoughtfully. \u201cAnd the small ones, where are they?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose Sir Eustace has got them with him.\u201d\r\n\r\nI turned the matter over in my mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said at last, \u201cit\u2019s awkward\u2014but it\u2019s safe enough. We\u2019d\r\nbetter do nothing for the present.\u201d\r\n\r\nSuzanne looked at me with a little smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like doing nothing, do you, Anne?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot very much,\u201d I replied honestly.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I could do was to get hold of a time-table and see\r\nwhat time Guy Pagett\u2019s train would pass through Kimberley. I found\r\nthat it would arrive at 5.40 on the following afternoon and depart\r\nagain at 6. I wanted to see Pagett as soon as possible, and that\r\nseemed to me a good opportunity. The situation on the Rand was\r\ngetting very serious, and it might be a long time before I got\r\nanother chance.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that livened up the day was a wire dispatched from\r\nJohannesburg. A most innocent-sounding telegram:\r\n\r\n\u201cArrived safely. All going well. Eric here, also Eustace, but not\r\nGuy. Remain where you are for the present. Andy.\u201d\r\n\r\nEric was our pseudonym for Race. I chose it because it is a name\r\nI dislike exceedingly. There was clearly nothing to be done until\r\nI could see Pagett. Suzanne employed herself in sending off a long\r\nsoothing cable to the far-off Clarence. She became quite sentimental\r\nover him. In her way\u2014which of course is quite different from me\r\nand Harry\u2014she is really fond of Clarence.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do wish he was here, Anne,\u201d she gulped. \u201cIt\u2019s such a long time\r\nsince I\u2019ve seen him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave some face cream,\u201d I said soothingly.\r\n\r\nSuzanne rubbed a little on the tip of her charming nose.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall want some more face cream soon too,\u201d she remarked, \u201cand\r\nyou can only get this kind in Paris.\u201d She sighed. \u201cParis!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuzanne,\u201d I said, \u201cvery soon you\u2019ll have had enough of South\r\nAfrica and adventure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like a really nice hat,\u201d admitted Suzanne wistfully.\r\n\u201cShall I come with you to meet Guy Pagett to-morrow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI prefer to go alone. He\u2019d be shyer speaking before two of us.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo it came about that I was standing in the doorway of the hotel\r\non the following afternoon, struggling with a recalcitrant parasol\r\nthat refused to go up, whilst Suzanne lay peacefully on her bed\r\nwith a book and a basket of fruit.\r\n\r\nAccording to the hotel porter, the train was on its good behaviour\r\nto-day and would be almost on time, though he was extremely doubtful\r\nwhether it would ever get through to Johannesburg. The line had\r\nbeen blown up, so he solemnly assured me. It sounded cheerful!\r\n\r\nThe train drew in just ten minutes late. Everybody tumbled out on\r\nthe platform and began walking up and down feverishly. I had no\r\ndifficulty in espying Pagett. I accosted him eagerly. He gave his\r\nusual nervous start at seeing me\u2014somewhat accentuated this time.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me, Miss Beddingfeld, I understood that you had disappeared.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have reappeared again,\u201d I told him solemnly. \u201cAnd how are you,\r\nMr. Pagett?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, thank you\u2014looking forward to taking up my work again\r\nwith Sir Eustace.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Pagett,\u201d I said, \u201cthere is something I want to ask you. I hope\r\nthat you won\u2019t be offended, but a lot hangs on it, more than you\r\ncan possibly guess. I want to know what you were doing at Marlow\r\non the 8th of January last?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe started violently.\r\n\r\n\u201cReally, Miss Beddingfeld\u2014I\u2014indeed\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou _were_ there, weren\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2014for reasons of my own I was in the neighbourhood, yes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t you tell me what those reasons were?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSir Eustace has not already told you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSir Eustace? Does he know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am almost sure that he does. I hoped he had not recognized me,\r\nbut from the hints he has let drop, and his remarks, I fear it is\r\nonly too certain. In any case, I meant to make a clean breast of\r\nthe matter and offer him my resignation. He is a peculiar man, Miss\r\nBeddingfeld, with an abnormal sense of humour. It seems to amuse\r\nhim to keep me on tenter-hooks. All the time, I dare say, he was\r\nperfectly well aware of the true facts. Possibly he has known them\r\nfor years.\u201d\r\n\r\nI hoped that sooner or later I should be able to understand what\r\nPagett was talking about. He went on fluently:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is difficult for a man of Sir Eustace\u2019s standing to put himself\r\nin my position. I know that I was in the wrong, but it seemed a\r\nharmless deception. I would have thought it better taste on his\r\npart to have tackled me outright\u2014instead of indulging in covert\r\njokes at my expense.\u201d\r\n\r\nA whistle blew, and the people began to surge back into the train.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Mr. Pagett,\u201d I broke in, \u201cI\u2019m sure I quite agree with all\r\nyou\u2019re saying about Sir Eustace. _But why did you go to Marlow?\u201d_\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was wrong of me, but natural under the circumstances\u2014yes, I\r\nstill feel natural under the circumstances.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat circumstances?\u201d I cried desperately.\r\n\r\nFor the first time Pagett seemed to recognize that I was asking\r\nhim a question. His mind detached itself from the peculiarities of\r\nSir Eustace and his own justification and came to rest on me.\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon, Miss Beddingfeld,\u201d he said stiffly, \u201cbut I fail\r\nto see your concern in the matter.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was back in the train now, leaning down to speak to me. I felt\r\ndesperate. What could one do with a man like that?\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course, if it\u2019s so dreadful that you\u2019d be ashamed to speak of\r\nit to me\u2014\u2014\u201d I began spitefully.\r\n\r\nAt last I had found the right stop. Pagett stiffened and flushed.\r\n\r\n\u201cDreadful? Ashamed? I don\u2019t understand you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen tell me.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn three short sentences he told me. At last I knew Pagett\u2019s\r\nsecret! It was not in the least what I expected.\r\n\r\nI walked slowly back to the hotel. There a wire was handed to me.\r\nI tore it open. It contained full and definite instructions for me\r\nto proceed forthwith to Johannesburg, or rather to a station this\r\nside of Johannesburg, where I should be met by a car. It was\r\nsigned, not Andy, but Harry.\r\n\r\nI sat down in a chair to do some very serious thinking.\r\n\n  _(From the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)_\r\n\r\n\r\n  Johannesburg,\r\n\r\n  _March 7th._\r\n\r\nPagett has arrived. He is in a blue funk of course. Suggested at\r\nonce that we should go off to Pretoria. Then, when I had told him\r\nkindly but firmly that we were going to remain here, he went to\r\nthe other extreme, wished he had his rifle here, and began bucking\r\nabout some bridge he guarded during the Great War. A railway bridge\r\nat Little Puddecombe junction, or something of that sort.\r\n\r\nI soon cut that short by telling him to unpack the big typewriter.\r\nI thought that that would keep him employed for some time, because\r\nthe typewriter was sure to have gone wrong\u2014it always does\u2014and he\r\nwould have to take it somewhere to be mended. But I had forgotten\r\nPagett\u2019s powers of being in the right.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve already unpacked all the cases, Sir Eustace. The typewriter\r\nis in perfect condition.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean\u2014all the cases?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe two small cases as well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t be so officious, Pagett. Those small cases\r\nwere no business of yours. They belong to Mrs. Blair.\u201d\r\n\r\nPagett looked crestfallen. He hates to make a mistake.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you can just pack them up again neatly,\u201d I continued. \u201cAfter\r\nthat you can go out and look around you. Jo\u2019burg will probably be\r\na heap of smoking ruins by to-morrow, so it may be your last\r\nchance.\u201d\r\n\r\nI thought that that would get rid of him successfully for the\r\nmorning, at any rate.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is something I want to say to you when you have the leisure,\r\nSir Eustace.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got it now,\u201d I said hastily. \u201cAt this minute I have\r\nabsolutely no leisure whatsoever.\u201d\r\n\r\nPagett retired.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d I called after him, \u201cwhat was there in those cases\r\nof Mrs. Blair\u2019s?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome fur rugs, and a couple of fur\u2014hats, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I assented. \u201cShe bought them on the train. They\r\n_are_ hats\u2014of a kind\u2014though I hardly wonder at your not recognizing\r\nthem. I dare say she\u2019s going to wear one of them at Ascot. What\r\nelse was there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome rolls of films and some baskets\u2014a lot of baskets\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere would be,\u201d I assured him. \u201cMrs. Blair is the kind of woman\r\nwho never buys less than a dozen or so of anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that\u2019s all, Sir Eustace, except some miscellaneous odds\r\nand ends, a motor-veil and some odd gloves\u2014that sort of thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been a born idiot, Pagett, you would have seen from\r\nthe start that those couldn\u2019t possibly be my belongings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought some of them might belong to Miss Pettigrew.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that reminds me\u2014what do you mean by picking me out such a\r\ndoubtful character as a secretary?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd I told him about the searching cross-examination I had been\r\nput through. Immediately I was sorry, I saw a glint in his eye that\r\nI knew only too well. I changed the conversation hurriedly. But it\r\nwas too late. Pagett was on the war-path.\r\n\r\nHe next proceeded to bore me with a long pointless story about the\r\n_Kilmorden._ It was about a roll of films and a wager. The roll of\r\nfilms being thrown through a porthole in the middle of the night\r\nby some steward who ought to have known better. I hate horse-play.\r\nI told Pagett so, and he began to tell me the story all over again.\r\nHe tells a story extremely badly, anyway. It was a long time before\r\nI could make head or tail of this one.\r\n\r\nI did not see him again until lunch-time. Then he came in brimming\r\nover with excitement, like a bloodhound on the scent. I never have\r\ncared for bloodhounds. The upshot of it all was that he had seen\r\nRayburn.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I cried, startled.\r\n\r\nYes, he had caught sight of some one whom he was sure was Rayburn\r\ncrossing the street. Pagett had followed him.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who do you think I saw him stop and speak to? Miss Pettigrew!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Sir Eustace. And that\u2019s not all. I\u2019ve been making inquiries\r\nabout her\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWait a bit. What happened to Rayburn?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe and Miss Pettigrew went into that corner curio-shop\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nI uttered an involuntary exclamation. Pagett stopped inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d I said. \u201cGo on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI waited outside for ages\u2014but they didn\u2019t come out. At last I went\r\nin. Sir Eustace, there was no one in the shop! There must be\r\nanother way out.\u201d\r\n\r\nI stared at him.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I was saying, I came back to the hotel and made some inquiries\r\nabout Miss Pettigrew.\u201d Pagett lowered his voice and breathed hard\r\nas he always does when he wants to be confidential. \u201cSir Eustace,\r\na man was seen coming out of her room last night.\u201d\r\n\r\nI raised my eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I always regarded her as a lady of such eminent respectability,\u201d\r\nI murmured.\r\n\r\nPagett went on without heeding.\r\n\r\n\u201cI went straight up and searched her room. What do you think I\r\nfound?\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis!\u201d\r\n\r\nPagett held up a safety razor and a stick of shaving soap.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat should a woman want with these?\u201d\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t suppose Pagett ever reads the advertisements in the\r\nhigh-class ladies\u2019 papers. I do. Whilst not proposing to argue with\r\nhim on the subject, I refused to accept the presence of the razor\r\nas proof positive of Miss Pettigrew\u2019s sex. Pagett is so hopelessly\r\nbehind the times. I should not have been at all surprised if he\r\nhad produced a cigarette-case to support his theory. However, even\r\nPagett has his limits.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not convinced, Sir Eustace. What do you say to _this?\u201d_\r\n\r\nI inspected the article which he dangled aloft triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt looks like hair,\u201d I remarked distastefully.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is hair. I think it\u2019s what they call a toupee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d I commented.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow are you convinced that that Pettigrew woman is a man in\r\ndisguise?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally, my dear Pagett, I think I am. I might have known it by\r\nher feet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen that\u2019s that. And now, Sir Eustace, I want to speak to you\r\nabout my private affairs. I cannot doubt, from your hints and your\r\ncontinual allusions to the time I was in Florence, that you have\r\nfound me out.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt last the mystery of what Pagett did in Florence is going to be\r\nrevealed!\r\n\r\n\u201cMake a clean breast of it, my dear fellow,\u201d I said kindly. \u201cMuch\r\nthe best way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, Sir Eustace.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it her husband? Annoying fellows, husbands. Always turning up\r\nwhen they\u2019re least expected.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fail to follow you, Sir Eustace. Whose husband?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe lady\u2019s husband.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat lady?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGod bless my soul, Pagett, the lady you met in Florence. There\r\nmust have been a lady. Don\u2019t tell me that you merely robbed a\r\nchurch or stabbed an Italian in the back because you didn\u2019t like\r\nhis face.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am quite at a loss to understand you, Sir Eustace. I suppose\r\nyou are joking.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am an amusing fellow sometimes, when I take the trouble, but I\r\ncan assure you that I am not trying to be funny this minute.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hoped that as I was a good way off you had not recognized me,\r\nSir Eustace.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRecognized you where?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt Marlow, Sir Eustace?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt Marlow? What the devil were you doing at Marlow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you understood that\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m beginning to understand less and less. Go back to the beginning\r\nof the story and start again. You went to Florence\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t know after all\u2014and you didn\u2019t recognize me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs far as I can judge, you seem to have given yourself away\r\nneedlessly\u2014made a coward of by your conscience. But I shall be able\r\nto tell better when I\u2019ve heard the whole story. Now, then, take a\r\ndeep breath and start again. You went to Florence\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t go to Florence. That is just it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, where did you go, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI went home\u2014to Marlow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the devil did you want to go to Marlow for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wanted to see my wife. She was in delicate health and expecting\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour wife? But I didn\u2019t know you were married?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, Sir Eustace, that is just what I am telling you. I deceived\r\nyou in this matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long have you been married?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust over eight years. I had been married just six months when I\r\nbecame your secretary. I did not want to lose the post. A resident\r\nsecretary is not supposed to have a wife, so I suppressed the\r\nfact.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou take my breath away,\u201d I remarked. \u201cWhere has she been all\r\nthese years?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have had a small bungalow on the river at Marlow, quite close\r\nto the Mill House, for over five years.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGod bless my soul,\u201d I muttered. \u201cAny children?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFour children, Sir Eustace.\u201d\r\n\r\nI gazed at him in a kind of stupor. I might have known, all along,\r\nthat a man like Pagett couldn\u2019t have a guilty secret. The\r\nrespectability of Pagett has always been my bane. That\u2019s just the\r\nkind of secret he would have\u2014a wife and four children.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you told this to any one else?\u201d I demanded at last, when I\r\nhad gazed at him in fascinated interest for quite a long while.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly Miss Beddingfeld. She came to the station at Kimberley.\u201d\r\n\r\nI continued to stare at him. He fidgeted under my glance.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope, Sir Eustace, that you are not seriously annoyed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you here and now\r\nthat you\u2019ve blinking well torn it!\u201d\r\n\r\nI went out seriously ruffled. As I passed the corner curio-shop,\r\nI was assailed by a sudden irresistible temptation and went in.\r\nThe proprietor came forward obsequiously, rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan I show you something? Furs, curios?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI want something quite out of the ordinary,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s for a\r\nspecial occasion. Will you show me what you\u2019ve got?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you will come into my back room? We have many specialties\r\nthere?\u201d\r\n\r\nThat is where I made a mistake. And I thought I was going to be so\r\nclever. I followed him through the swinging _porti\u00e8res._\r\n\n  _(Anne\u2019s Narrative Resumed)_\r\n\r\n\r\nI had great trouble with Suzanne. She argued, she pleaded, she even\r\nwept before she would let me carry out my plan. But in the end I\r\ngot my own way. She promised to carry out my instructions to the\r\nletter and came down to the station to bid me a tearful farewell.\r\n\r\nI arrived at my destination the following morning early. I was met\r\nby a short black-bearded Dutchman whom I had never seen before. He\r\nhad a car waiting and we drove off. There was a queer booming in\r\nthe distance, and I asked him what it was. \u201cGuns,\u201d he answered\r\nlaconically. So there was fighting going on in Jo\u2019burg!\r\n\r\nI gathered that our objective was a spot somewhere in the suburbs\r\nof the city. We turned and twisted and made several detours to get\r\nthere, and every minute the guns were nearer. It was an exciting\r\ntime. At last we stopped before a somewhat ramshackle building.\r\nThe door was opened by a Kafir boy. My guide signed to me to enter.\r\nI stood irresolute in the dingy square hall. The man passed me and\r\nthrew open a door.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe young lady to see Mr. Harry Rayburn,\u201d he said, and laughed.\r\n\r\nThus announced, I passed in. The room was sparsely furnished and\r\nsmelt of cheap tobacco smoke. Behind a desk a man sat writing. He\r\nlooked up and raised his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me,\u201d he said, \u201cif it isn\u2019t Miss Beddingfeld!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI must be seeing double,\u201d I apologized. \u201cIs it Mr. Chichester, or\r\nis it Miss Pettigrew? There is an extraordinary resemblance to both\r\nof them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBoth characters are in abeyance for the moment. I have doffed my\r\npetticoats\u2014and my cloth likewise. Won\u2019t you sit down?\u201d\r\n\r\nI accepted a seat composedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would seem,\u201d I remarked, \u201cthat I have come to the wrong\r\naddress.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom your point of view, I am afraid you have. Really, Miss\r\nBeddingfeld, to fall into the trap a second time!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was not very bright of me,\u201d I admitted meekly. Something about\r\nmy manner seemed to puzzle him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou hardly seem upset by the occurrence,\u201d he remarked dryly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWould my going into heroics have any effect upon you?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt certainly would not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy great-aunt Jane always used to say that a true lady was neither\r\nshocked nor surprised at anything that might happen,\u201d I murmured\r\ndreamily. \u201cI endeavour to live up to her precepts.\u201d\r\n\r\nI read Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew\u2019s opinion so plainly written on\r\nhis face that I hastened into speech once more.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou really are positively marvellous at make-up,\u201d I said\r\ngenerously. \u201cAll the time you were Miss Pettigrew I never recognized\r\nyou\u2014even when you broke your pencil in the shock of seeing me climb\r\nupon the train at Cape Town.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe tapped upon the desk with the pencil he was holding in his hand\r\nat the minute.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll this is very well in its way, but we must get to business.\r\nPerhaps, Miss Beddingfeld, you can guess why we required your\r\npresence here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will excuse me,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I never do business with any\r\none but principals.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had read the phrase or something like it in a money-lender\u2019s\r\ncircular, and I was rather pleased with it. It certainly had a\r\ndevastating effect upon Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew. He opened his\r\nmouth and then shut it again. I beamed upon him.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy great-uncle George\u2019s maxim,\u201d I added, as an afterthought.\r\n\u201cGreat-aunt Jane\u2019s husband, you know. He made knobs for brass\r\nbeds.\u201d\r\n\r\nI doubt if Chichester-Pettigrew had ever been ragged before. He\r\ndidn\u2019t like it at all.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think you would be wise to alter your tone, young lady.\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not reply, but yawned\u2014a delicate little yawn that hinted at\r\nintense boredom.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the devil\u2014\u2014\u201d he began forcibly.\r\n\r\nI interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can assure you it\u2019s no good shouting at me. We are only wasting\r\ntime here. I have no intention of talking with underlings. You will\r\nsave a lot of time and annoyance by taking me straight to Sir\r\nEustace Pedler.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked dumbfounded.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cSir Eustace Pedler.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2014excuse me\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nHe bolted from the room like a rabbit. I took advantage of the\r\nrespite to open my bag and powder my nose thoroughly. Also I\r\nsettled my hat at a more becoming angle. Then I settled myself to\r\nwait with patience for my enemy\u2019s return.\r\n\r\nHe reappeared in a subtly chastened mood.\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you come this way, Miss Beddingfeld?\u201d\r\n\r\nI followed him up the stairs. He knocked at the door of a room, a\r\nbrisk \u201cCome in\u201d sounded from inside, and he opened the door and\r\nmotioned to me to pass inside.\r\n\r\nSir Eustace Pedler sprang up to greet me, genial and smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well, Miss Anne.\u201d He shook me warmly by the hand. \u201cI\u2019m\r\ndelighted to see you. Come and sit down. Not tired after your\r\njourney? That\u2019s good.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe sat down facing me, still beaming. It left me rather at a loss.\r\nHis manner was so completely natural.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite right to insist on being brought straight to me,\u201d he went\r\non. \u201cMinks is a fool. A clever actor\u2014but a fool. That was Minks\r\nyou saw downstairs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, really,\u201d I said feebly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d said Sir Eustace cheerfully, \u201clet\u2019s get down to facts.\r\nHow long have you known that I was the \u2018Colonel\u2019?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEver since Mr. Pagett told me that he had seen you in Marlow when\r\nyou were supposed to be in Cannes.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir Eustace nodded ruefully.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I told the fool he\u2019d blinking well torn it. He didn\u2019t\r\nunderstand of course. His whole mind was set on whether _I\u2019d_\r\nrecognized _him._ It never occurred to him to wonder what I was\r\ndoing down there. A piece of sheer bad luck that was. I arranged\r\nit all so carefully too, sending him off to Florence, telling the\r\nhotel I was going over to Nice for one night or possibly two. Then,\r\nby the time the murder was discovered, I was back again in Cannes,\r\nwith nobody dreaming that I\u2019d ever left the Riviera.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe still spoke quite naturally and unaffectedly. I had to pinch\r\nmyself to understand that this was all real\u2014that the man in front\r\nof me was really that deep-dyed criminal, the \u201cColonel.\u201d I followed\r\nthings out in my mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen it was you who tried to throw me overboard on the _Kilmorden,\u201d_\r\nI said slowly. \u201cIt was you that Pagett followed up on deck that\r\nnight?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cI apologize, my dear child, I really do. I always liked you\u2014but\r\nyou were so confoundedly interfering. I couldn\u2019t have all my plans\r\nbrought to naught by a chit of a girl.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think your plan at the Falls was really the cleverest,\u201d I said,\r\nendeavouring to look at the thing in a detached fashion. \u201cI would\r\nhave been ready to swear anywhere that you were in the hotel when\r\nI went out. Seeing is believing in future.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Minks had one of his greatest successes as Miss Pettigrew,\r\nand he can imitate my voice quite creditably.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is one thing I should like to know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you induce Pagett to engage her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that was quite simple. She met Pagett in the doorway of the\r\nTrade Commissioner\u2019s office or the Chamber of Mines, or wherever\r\nit was he went\u2014told him I had phoned down in a hurry, and that she\r\nhad been selected by the Government department in question. Pagett\r\nswallowed it like a lamb.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re very frank,\u201d I said, studying him.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no earthly reason why I shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t quite like the sound of that. I hastened to put my own\r\ninterpretation on it.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou believe in the success of this Revolution? You\u2019ve burnt your\r\nboats.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor an otherwise intelligent young woman, that\u2019s a singularly\r\nunintelligent remark. No, my dear child, I do not believe in this\r\nRevolution. I give it a couple of days longer and it will fizzle\r\nout ignominiously.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot one of your successes, in fact?\u201d I said nastily.\r\n\r\n\u201cLike all women, you\u2019ve no idea of business. The job I took on was\r\nto supply certain explosives and arms\u2014heavily paid for\u2014to foment\r\nfeeling generally, and to incriminate certain people up to the\r\nhilt. I\u2019ve carried out my contract with complete success, and I\r\nwas careful to be paid in advance. I took special care over the\r\nwhole thing, as I intended it to be my last contract before retiring\r\nfrom business. As for burning my boats, as you call it, I simply\r\ndon\u2019t know what you mean. I\u2019m not the rebel chief, or anything of\r\nthat kind\u2014I\u2019m a distinguished English visitor, who had the\r\nmisfortune to go nosing into a certain curio-shop\u2014and saw a little\r\nmore than he was meant to, and so the poor fellow was kidnapped.\r\nTo-morrow, or the day after, when circumstances permit, I shall be\r\nfound tied up somewhere in a pitiable state of terror and\r\nstarvation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d I said slowly. \u201cBut what about me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just it,\u201d said Sir Eustace softly. \u201cWhat about you? I\u2019ve\r\ngot you here\u2014I don\u2019t want to rub it in in any way\u2014but I\u2019ve got you\r\nhere very neatly. The question is, what am I going to do with you?\r\nThe simplest way of disposing of you\u2014and, I may add, the pleasantest\r\nto myself\u2014is the way of marriage. Wives can\u2019t accuse their husbands,\r\nyou know, and I\u2019d rather like a pretty young wife to hold my hand\r\nand glance at me out of liquid eyes\u2014don\u2019t flash them at me so! You\r\nquite frighten me. I see that the plan does not commend itself to\r\nyou?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt does not.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir Eustace sighed.\r\n\r\n\u201cA pity! But I am no Adelphi villain. The usual trouble, I suppose.\r\nYou love another, as the books say.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI love another.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought as much\u2014first I thought it was that long-legged, pompous\r\nass, Race, but I suppose it\u2019s the young hero who fished you out of\r\nthe Falls that night. Women have no taste. Neither of those two\r\nhave half the brains that I have. I\u2019m such an easy person to\r\nunderestimate.\u201d\r\n\r\nI think he was right about that. Although I knew well enough the\r\nkind of man he was and must be, I could not bring myself to realize\r\nit. He had tried to kill me on more than one occasion, he had\r\nactually killed another woman, and he was responsible for endless\r\nother deeds of which I knew nothing, and yet I was quite unable to\r\nbring myself into the frame of mind for appreciating his deeds as\r\nthey deserved. I could not think of him as other than our amusing,\r\ngenial travelling companion. I could not even feel frightened of\r\nhim\u2014and yet I knew he was capable of having me murdered in cold\r\nblood if it struck him as necessary. The only parallel I can think\r\nof is the case of Stevenson\u2019s Long John Silver. He must have been\r\nmuch the same kind of man.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said this extraordinary person, leaning back in his\r\nchair. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that the idea of being Lady Pedler doesn\u2019t\r\nappeal to you. The other alternatives are rather crude.\u201d\r\n\r\nI felt a nasty feeling going up and down my spine. Of course I had\r\nknown all along that I was taking a big risk, but the prize had\r\nseemed worth it. Would things turn out as I had calculated, or\r\nwould they not?\r\n\r\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is,\u201d Sir Eustace was continuing, \u201cI\u2019ve a\r\nweakness for you. I really don\u2019t want to proceed to extremes.\r\nSuppose you tell me the whole story, from the very beginning, and\r\nlet\u2019s see what we can make of it. But no romancing, mind\u2014I want\r\nthe truth.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was not going to make any mistake over that. I had a great deal\r\nof respect for Sir Eustace\u2019s shrewdness. It was a moment for the\r\ntruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I told him the\r\nwhole story, omitting nothing, up to the moment of my rescue by\r\nHarry. When I had finished, he nodded his head in approval.\r\n\r\n\u201cWise girl. You\u2019ve made a clean breast of the thing. And let me\r\ntell you I should soon have caught you out if you hadn\u2019t. A lot of\r\npeople wouldn\u2019t believe your story, anyway, especially the beginning\r\npart, but I do. You\u2019re the kind of girl who would start off like\r\nthat\u2014at a moment\u2019s notice, on the slenderest of motives. You\u2019ve\r\nhad amazing luck, of course, but sooner or later the amateur runs\r\nup against the professional and then the result is a foregone\r\nconclusion. I am the professional. I started on this business when\r\nI was quite a youngster. All things considered, it seemed to me a\r\ngood way of getting rich quickly. I always could think things out,\r\nand devise ingenious schemes\u2014and I never made the mistake of trying\r\nto carry out my schemes myself. Always employ the expert\u2014that has\r\nbeen my motto. The one time I departed from it I came to grief\u2014but\r\nI couldn\u2019t trust any one to do that job for me. Nadina knew too\r\nmuch. I\u2019m an easy-going man, kind-hearted and good tempered so long\r\nas I\u2019m not thwarted. Nadina both thwarted me and threatened me\u2014just\r\nas I was at the apex of a successful career. Once she was dead and\r\nthe diamonds were in my possession, I was safe. I\u2019ve come to the\r\nconclusion now that I bungled the job. That idiot Pagett, with his\r\nwife and family! My fault\u2014it tickled my sense of humour to employ\r\nthe fellow, with his Cinquecento poisoner\u2019s face and his\r\nmid-Victorian soul. A maxim for you, my dear Anne. Don\u2019t let your\r\nsense of humour carry you away. For years I\u2019ve had an instinct that\r\nit would be wise to get rid of Pagett, but the fellow was so\r\nhard-working and conscientious that I honestly couldn\u2019t find an\r\nexcuse for sacking him. So I left things drift.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut we\u2019re wandering from the point. The question is what to do\r\nwith you. Your narrative was admirably clear, but there is one\r\nthing that still escapes me. Where are the diamonds now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHarry Rayburn has them,\u201d I said, watching him.\r\n\r\nHis face did not change, it retained its expression of sardonic\r\ngood-humour.\r\n\r\n\u201cH\u2019m. I want those diamonds.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see much chance of your getting them,\u201d I replied.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you? Now I do. I don\u2019t want to be unpleasant, but I should\r\nlike you to reflect that a dead girl or so found in this quarter\r\nof the city will occasion no surprise. There\u2019s a man downstairs\r\nwho does those sort of jobs very neatly. Now, you\u2019re a sensible\r\nyoung woman. What I propose is this: you will sit down and write\r\nto Harry Rayburn, telling him to join you here and bring the\r\ndiamonds with him\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t do anything of the kind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t interrupt your elders. I propose to make a bargain with you.\r\nThe diamonds in exchange for your life. And don\u2019t make any mistake\r\nabout it, your life is absolutely in my power.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Harry?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m far too tender-hearted to part two young lovers. He shall go\r\nfree too\u2014on the understanding, of course, that neither of you will\r\ninterfere with me in future.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what guarantee have I that you will keep your side of the\r\nbargain?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone whatever, my dear girl. You\u2019ll have to trust me and hope for\r\nthe best. Of course, if you\u2019re in an heroic mood and prefer\r\nannihilation, that\u2019s another matter.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was what I had been playing for. I was careful not to jump at\r\nthe bait. Gradually I allowed myself to be bullied and cajoled into\r\nyielding. I wrote at Sir Eustace\u2019s dictation:\r\n\r\nDear Harry,\r\n\r\nI think I see a chance of establishing your innocence beyond any\r\npossible doubt. Please follow my instructions minutely. Go to\r\nAgrasato\u2019s curio-shop. Ask to see something \u201cout of the ordinary,\u201d\r\n\u201cfor a special occasion.\u201d The man will then ask you to \u201ccome into\r\nthe back room.\u201d Go with him. You will find a messenger who will\r\nbring you to me. Do exactly as he tells you. Be sure and bring the\r\ndiamonds with you. Not a word to any one.\r\n\r\nSir Eustace stopped. \u201cI leave the fancy touches to your own\r\nimagination,\u201d he remarked. \u201cBut be careful to make no mistakes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yours for ever and ever, Anne,\u2019 will be sufficient,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\nI wrote in the words. Sir Eustace stretched out his hand for the\r\nletter and read it through.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat seems all right. Now the address.\u201d\r\n\r\nI gave it him. It was that of a small shop which received letters\r\nand telegrams for a consideration.\r\n\r\nHe struck the bell upon the table with his hand. Chichester-Pettigrew,\r\n_alias_ Minks, answered the summons.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis letter is to go immediately\u2014the usual route.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, Colonel.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked at the name on the envelope. Sir Eustace was watching\r\nhim keenly.\r\n\r\n\u201cA friend of yours, I think?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf mine?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man seemed startled.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou had a prolonged conversation with him in Johannesburg\r\nyesterday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA man came up and questioned me about your movements and those of\r\nColonel Race. I gave him misleading information.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcellent, my dear fellow, excellent,\u201d said Sir Eustace genially.\r\n\u201cMy mistake.\u201d\r\n\r\nI chanced to look at Chichester-Pettigrew as he left the room. He\r\nwas white to the lips, as though in deadly terror. No sooner was\r\nhe outside than Sir Eustace picked up a speaking-tube that rested\r\nby his elbow and spoke down it.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat you, Schwart? Watch Minks. He\u2019s not to leave the house\r\nwithout orders.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe put the speaking-tube down again and frowned, slightly tapping\r\nthe table with his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cMay I ask you a few questions, Sir Eustace,\u201d I said, after a\r\nminute or two of silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. What excellent nerves you have, Anne. You are capable\r\nof taking an intelligent interest in things when most girls would\r\nbe sniffling and wringing their hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you take Harry as your secretary instead of giving him up\r\nto the police?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wanted those cursed diamonds. Nadina, the little devil, was\r\nplaying off your Harry against me. Unless I gave her the price she\r\nwanted, she threatened to sell them back to him. That was another\r\nmistake I made\u2014I thought she\u2019d have them with her that day. But\r\nshe was too clever for that. Carton, her husband, was dead too\u2014I\u2019d\r\nno clue whatsoever as to where the diamonds were hidden. Then I\r\nmanaged to get a copy of a wireless message sent to Nadina by some\r\none on board the _Kilmorden_\u2014either Carton or Rayburn, I didn\u2019t\r\nknow which. It was a duplicate of that piece of paper you picked\r\nup. \u2018Seventeen one twenty two,\u2019 it ran. I took it to be an\r\nappointment with Rayburn, and when he was so desperate to get\r\naboard the _Kilmorden_ I was convinced that I was right. So I\r\npretended to swallow his statements, and let him come. I kept a\r\npretty sharp watch upon him and hoped that I should learn more.\r\nThen I found Minks trying to play a lone hand and interfering with\r\nme. I soon stopped that. He came to heel all right. It was annoying\r\nnot getting Cabin 17, and it worried me not being able to place\r\nyou. Were you the innocent young girl you seemed, or were you not?\r\nWhen Rayburn set out to keep the appointment that night, Minks was\r\ntold off to intercept him. Minks muffed it of course.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why did the wireless message say \u2018seventeen\u2019 instead of\r\n\u2018seventy-one\u2019?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought that out. Carton must have given that wireless\r\noperator his own memorandum to copy off on to a form, and he never\r\nread the copy through. The operator made the same mistake we all\r\ndid, and read it as 17.1.22 instead of 1.71.22. The thing I don\u2019t\r\nknow is how Minks got on to Cabin 17. It must have been sheer\r\ninstinct.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the dispatch to General Smuts? Who tampered with that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Anne, you don\u2019t suppose I was going to have a lot of my\r\nplans given away, without making an effort to save them? With an\r\nescaped murderer as a secretary, I had no hesitation whatever in\r\nsubstituting blanks. Nobody would think of suspecting poor old\r\nPedler.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about Colonel Race?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that was a nasty jar. When Pagett told me he was a Secret\r\nService fellow, I had an unpleasant feeling down the spine. I\r\nremembered that he\u2019d been nosing around Nadina in Paris during the\r\nWar\u2014and I had a horrible suspicion that he was out after _me!_ I\r\ndon\u2019t like the way he\u2019s stuck to me ever since. He\u2019s one of those\r\nstrong, silent men who have always got something up their sleeve.\u201d\r\n\r\nA whistle sounded. Sir Eustace picked up the tube, listened for a\r\nminute or two, then answered:\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, I\u2019ll see him now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBusiness,\u201d he remarked. \u201cMiss Anne, let me show you your room.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe ushered me into a small shabby apartment, a Kafir boy brought\r\nup my small suit-case, and Sir Eustace, urging me to ask for\r\nanything I wanted, withdrew, the picture of a courteous host. A\r\ncan of hot water was on the washstand, and I proceeded to unpack\r\na few necessaries. Something hard and unfamiliar in my sponge-bag\r\npuzzled me greatly. I untied the string and looked inside.\r\n\r\nTo my utter amazement I drew out a small pearl-handled revolver.\r\nIt hadn\u2019t been there when I started from Kimberley. I examined the\r\nthing gingerly. It appeared to be loaded.\r\n\r\nI handled it with a comfortable feeling. It was a useful thing to\r\nhave in a house such as this. But modern clothes are quite unsuited\r\nto the carrying of fire-arms. In the end I pushed it gingerly into\r\nthe top of my stocking. It made a terrible bulge, and I expected\r\nevery minute that it would go off and shoot me in the leg, but it\r\nreally seemed the only place.\r\n\nI was not summoned to Sir Eustace\u2019s presence until late in the\r\nafternoon. Eleven-o\u2019clock tea and a substantial lunch had been\r\nserved to me in my own apartment, and I felt fortified for further\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\nSir Eustace was alone. He was walking up and down the room, and\r\nthere was a gleam in his eye and a restlessness in his manner which\r\ndid not escape me. He was exultant about something. There was a\r\nsubtle change in his manner towards me.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have news for you. Your young man is on his way. He will be here\r\nin a few minutes. Moderate your transports\u2014I have something more\r\nto say. You attempted to deceive me this morning. I warned you that\r\nyou would be wise to stick to the truth, and up to a certain point\r\nyou obeyed me. Then you ran off the rails. You attempted to make\r\nme believe that the diamonds were in Harry Rayburn\u2019s possession.\r\nAt the time, I accepted your statement because it facilitated my\r\ntask\u2014the task of inducing you to decoy Harry Rayburn here. But, my\r\ndear Anne, the diamonds have been in my possession ever since I\r\nleft the Falls\u2014though I only discovered the fact yesterday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know!\u201d I gasped.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may interest you to hear that it was Pagett who gave the show\r\naway. He insisted on boring me with a long pointless story about\r\na wager and a tin of films. It didn\u2019t take me long to put two and\r\ntwo together\u2014Mrs. Blair\u2019s distrust of Colonel Race, her agitation,\r\nher entreaty that I would take care of her souvenirs for her. The\r\nexcellent Pagett had already unfastened the cases through an excess\r\nof zeal. Before leaving the hotel, I simply transferred all the\r\nrolls of films to my own pocket. They are in the corner there. I\r\nadmit that I haven\u2019t had time to examine them yet, but I notice\r\nthat one is of a totally different weight to the others, rattles\r\nin a peculiar fashion, and has evidently been stuck down with\r\nseccotine, which will necessitate the use of a tin-opener. The case\r\nseems clear, does it not? And now, you see, I have you both nicely\r\nin the trap. . . . It\u2019s a pity that you didn\u2019t take kindly to the\r\nidea of becoming Lady Pedler.\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not answer. I stood looking at him.\r\n\r\nThere was the sound of feet on the stairs, the door was flung open,\r\nand Harry Rayburn was hustled into the room between two men. Sir\r\nEustace flung me a look of triumph.\r\n\r\n\u201cAccording to plan,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou amateurs _will_ pit\r\nyourselves against professionals.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d cried Harry hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt means that you have walked into my parlour\u2014said the spider to\r\nthe fly,\u201d remarked Sir Eustace facetiously. \u201cMy dear Rayburn, you\r\nare extraordinarily unlucky.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou said I could come safely, Anne?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not reproach her, my dear fellow. That note was written at my\r\ndictation, and the lady could not help herself. She would have been\r\nwiser not to write it, but I did not tell her so at the time. You\r\nfollowed her instructions, went to the curio-shop, were taken\r\nthrough the secret passage from the back room\u2014and found yourself\r\nin the hands of your enemies!\u201d\r\n\r\nHarry looked at me. I understood his glance and edged nearer to\r\nSir Eustace.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d murmured the latter, \u201cdecidedly you are not lucky! This\r\nis\u2014let me see, the third encounter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are right,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThis is the third encounter. Twice\r\nyou have worsted me\u2014have you never heard that the third time the\r\nluck changes? This is my round\u2014cover him, Anne.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was all ready. In a flash I had whipped the pistol out of my\r\nstocking and was holding it to his head. The two men guarding Harry\r\nsprang forward, but his voice stopped them.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnother step\u2014and he dies! If they come any nearer, Anne, pull the\r\ntrigger\u2014don\u2019t hesitate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shan\u2019t,\u201d I replied cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019m rather afraid of pulling\r\nit, anyway.\u201d\r\n\r\nI think Sir Eustace shared my fears. He was certainly shaking like\r\na jelly.\r\n\r\n\u201cStay where you are,\u201d he commanded, and the men stopped obediently.\r\n\r\n\u201cTell them to leave the room,\u201d said Harry.\r\n\r\nSir Eustace gave the order. The men filed out, and Harry shot the\r\nbolt across the door behind them.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow we can talk,\u201d he observed grimly, and coming across the room,\r\nhe took the revolver out of my hand.\r\n\r\nSir Eustace uttered a sigh of relief and wiped his forehead with\r\na handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m shockingly out of condition,\u201d he observed. \u201cI think I must\r\nhave a weak heart. I am glad that revolver is in competent hands.\r\nI didn\u2019t trust Miss Anne with it. Well, my young friend, as you\r\nsay, now we can talk. I\u2019m willing to admit that you stole a march\r\nupon me. Where the devil that revolver came from I don\u2019t know. I\r\nhad the girl\u2019s luggage searched when she arrived. And where did\r\nyou produce it from now? You hadn\u2019t got it on you a minute ago?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I had,\u201d I replied. \u201cIt was in my stocking.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know enough about women. I ought to have studied them\r\nmore,\u201d said Sir Eustace sadly. \u201cI wonder if Pagett would have known\r\nthat?\u201d\r\n\r\nHarry rapped sharply on the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t play the fool. If it weren\u2019t for your grey hairs, I\u2019d throw\r\nyou out of the window. You damned scoundrel! Grey hairs, or no grey\r\nhairs, I\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nHe advanced a step or two, and Sir Eustace skipped nimbly behind\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe young are always so violent,\u201d he said reproachfully. \u201cUnable\r\nto use their brains, they rely solely on their muscles. Let us talk\r\nsense. For the moment you have the upper hand. But that state of\r\naffairs cannot continue. The house is full of my men. You are\r\nhopelessly outnumbered. Your momentary ascendency has been gained\r\nby an accident\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHas it?\u201d\r\n\r\nSomething in Harry\u2019s voice, a grim raillery, seemed to attract Sir\r\nEustace\u2019s attention. He stared at him.\r\n\r\n\u201cHas it?\u201d said Harry again. \u201cSit down, Sir Eustace, and listen to\r\nwhat I have to say.\u201d Still covering him with the revolver, he went\r\non: \u201cThe cards are against you this time. To begin with, listen to\r\n_that!\u201d_\r\n\r\n_That_ was a dull banging at the door below. There were shouts,\r\noaths, and then a sound of firing. Sir Eustace paled.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRace\u2014and his people. You didn\u2019t know, did you, Sir Eustace, that\r\nAnne had an arrangement with me by which we should know whether\r\ncommunications from one to the other were genuine? Telegrams were\r\nto be signed \u2018Andy,\u2019 letters were to have the word \u2018and\u2019 crossed\r\nout somewhere in them. Anne knew that your telegram was a fake.\r\nShe came here of her own free will, walked deliberately into the\r\nsnare, in the hope that she might catch you in your own trap.\r\nBefore leaving Kimberley she wired both to me and to Race. Mrs.\r\nBlair has been in communication with us ever since. I received the\r\nletter written at your dictation, which was just what I expected.\r\nI had already discussed the probabilities of a secret passage\r\nleading out of the curio-shop with Race, and he had discovered the\r\nplace where the exit was situated.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a screaming, tearing sound, and a heavy explosion which\r\nshook the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re shelling this part of the town. I must get you out of\r\nhere, Anne.\u201d\r\n\r\nA bright light flared up. The house opposite was on fire. Sir\r\nEustace had risen and was passing up and down. Harry kept him\r\ncovered with the revolver.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you see, Sir Eustace, the game is up. It was you yourself who\r\nvery kindly provided us with the clue of your whereabouts. Race\u2019s\r\nmen were watching the exit of the secret passage. In spite of the\r\nprecautions you took, they were successful in following me here.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir Eustace turned suddenly.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery clever. Very creditable. But I\u2019ve still a word to say. If\r\nI\u2019ve lost the trick, so have you. You\u2019ll never be able to bring\r\nthe murder of Nadina home to me. I was in Marlow on that day,\r\nthat\u2019s all you\u2019ve got against me. No one can prove that I even knew\r\nthe woman. But you knew her, you had a motive for killing her\u2014and\r\nyour record\u2019s against you. You\u2019re a thief, remember, a thief.\r\nThere\u2019s one thing you don\u2019t know, perhaps. _I\u2019ve got the diamonds._\r\nAnd here goes\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nWith an incredibly swift movement, he stooped, swung up his arm\r\nand threw. There was a tinkle of breaking glass, as the object went\r\nthrough the window and disappeared into the blazing mass opposite.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere goes your only hope of establishing your innocence over the\r\nKimberley affair. And now we\u2019ll talk. I\u2019ll drive a bargain with\r\nyou. You\u2019ve got me cornered. Race will find all he needs in this\r\nhouse. There\u2019s a chance for me if I can get away. I\u2019m done for if\r\nI stay, but so are you, young man! There\u2019s a skylight in the next\r\nroom. A couple of minutes\u2019 start and I shall be all right. I\u2019ve\r\ngot one or two little arrangements all ready made. You let me out\r\nthat way, and give me a start\u2014and I leave you a signed confession\r\nthat I killed Nadina.\u201d\r\n\r\n_\u201cYes,_ Harry,\u201d I cried. \u201cYes, yes, yes!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe turned a stern face on me.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, Anne, a thousand times, no. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do. It solves everything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d never be able to look Race in the face again. I\u2019ll take my\r\nchance, but I\u2019m damned if I\u2019ll let this slippery old fox get away.\r\nIt\u2019s no good, Anne. I won\u2019t do it.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir Eustace chuckled. He accepted defeat without the least emotion.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d he remarked. \u201cYou seem to have met your master, Anne.\r\nBut I can assure you both that moral rectitude does not always\r\npay.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a crash of rending wood, and footsteps surged up the\r\nstairs. Harry drew back the bolt. Colonel Race was the first to\r\nenter the room. His face lit at the sight of us.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re safe, Anne. I was afraid\u2014\u2014\u201d He turned to Sir Eustace. \u201cI\u2019ve\r\nbeen after you for a long time, Pedler\u2014and at last I\u2019ve got you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEverybody seems to have gone completely mad,\u201d declared Sir Eustace\r\nairily. \u201cThese young people have been threatening me with revolvers\r\nand accusing me of the most shocking things. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s\r\nall about.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you? It means that I\u2019ve found the \u2018Colonel.\u2019 It means that\r\non January 8th last you were not at Cannes, but at Marlow. It means\r\nthat when your tool, Madame Nadina, turned against you, you planned\r\nto do away with her\u2014and at last we shall be able to bring the crime\r\nhome to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed? And from whom did you get all this interesting information?\r\nFrom the man who is even now being looked for by the police? His\r\nevidence will be very valuable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have other evidence. There is some one else who knew that\r\nNadina was going to meet you at the Mill House.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir Eustace looked surprised. Colonel Race made a gesture with his\r\nhand. Arthur Minks _alias_ the Rev. Edward Chichester _alias_ Miss\r\nPettigrew stepped forward. He was pale and nervous, but he spoke\r\nclearly enough:\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw Nadina in Paris the night before she went over to England.\r\nI was posing at the time as a Russian Count. She told me of her\r\npurpose. I warned her, knowing what kind of man she had to deal\r\nwith, but she did not take my advice. There was a wireless message\r\non the table. I read it. Afterwards I thought I would have a try\r\nfor the diamonds myself. In Johannesburg, Mr. Rayburn accosted me.\r\nHe persuaded me to come over to his side.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir Eustace looked at him. He said nothing, but Minks seemed\r\nvisibly to wilt.\r\n\r\n\u201cRats always leaving a sinking ship,\u201d observed Sir Eustace. \u201cI\r\ndon\u2019t care for rats. Sooner or later, I destroy vermin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s just one thing I\u2019d like to tell you, Sir Eustace,\u201d I\r\nremarked. \u201cThat tin you threw out of the window didn\u2019t contain the\r\ndiamonds. It had common pebbles in it. The diamonds are in a\r\nperfectly safe place. As a matter of fact, they\u2019re in the big\r\ngiraffe\u2019s stomach. Suzanne hollowed it out, put the diamonds in\r\nwith cotton wool, so that they wouldn\u2019t rattle, and plugged it up\r\nagain.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir Eustace looked at me for some time. His reply was characteristic:\r\n\r\n\u201cI always did hate that blinking giraffe,\u201d he said. \u201cIt must have\r\nbeen instinct.\u201d\r\n\nWe were not able to return to Johannesburg that night. The shells\r\nwere coming over pretty fast, and I gathered that we were now more\r\nor less cut off, owing to the rebels having obtained possession of\r\na new part of the suburbs.\r\n\r\nOur place of refuge was a farm some twenty miles or so from\r\nJohannesburg\u2014right out on the veld. I was dropping with fatigue.\r\nAll the excitement and anxiety of the last two days had left me\r\nlittle better than a limp rag.\r\n\r\nI kept repeating to myself, without being able to believe it, that\r\nour troubles were really over. Harry and I were together and we\r\nshould never be separated again. Yet all through I was conscious\r\nof some barrier between us\u2014a constraint on his part, the reason of\r\nwhich I could not fathom.\r\n\r\nSir Eustace had been driven off in an opposite direction accompanied\r\nby a strong guard. He waved his hand airily to us on departing.\r\n\r\nI came out on to the _stoep_ early on the following morning and\r\nlooked across the veld in the direction of Johannesburg. I could\r\nsee the great dumps glistening in the pale morning sunshine, and\r\nI could hear the low rumbling mutter of the guns. The Revolution\r\nwas not over yet.\r\n\r\nThe farmer\u2019s wife came out and called me in to breakfast. She was\r\na kind, motherly soul, and I was already very fond of her. Harry\r\nhad gone out at dawn and had not yet returned, so she informed me.\r\nAgain I felt a stir of uneasiness pass over me. What was this\r\nshadow of which I was so conscious between us?\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast I sat out on the _stoep_, a book in my hand which\r\nI did not read. I was so lost in my own thoughts that I never saw\r\nColonel Race ride up and dismount from his horse. It was not until\r\nhe said \u201cGood morning, Anne,\u201d that I became aware of his presence.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said, with a flush, \u201cit\u2019s you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. May I sit down?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe drew a chair up beside me. It was the first time we had been\r\nalone together since that day at the Matoppos. As always, I felt\r\nthat curious mixture of fascination and fear that he never failed\r\nto inspire in me.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is the news?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cSmuts will be in Johannesburg to-morrow. I give this outbreak\r\nthree days more before it collapses utterly. In the meantime the\r\nfighting goes on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish,\u201d I said, \u201cthat one could be sure that the right people\r\nwere the ones to get killed. I mean the ones who wanted to fight\u2014not\r\njust all the poor people who happen to live in the parts where the\r\nfighting is going on.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know what you mean, Anne. That\u2019s the unfairness of war. But I\u2019ve\r\nother news for you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA confession of incompetency on my part. Pedler has managed to\r\nescape.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. No one knows how he managed it. He was securely locked up\r\nfor the night\u2014in an upper-story room of one of the farms roundabouts\r\nwhich the Military have taken over, but this morning the room was\r\nempty and the bird had flown.\u201d\r\n\r\nSecretly I was rather pleased. Never, to this day, have I been able\r\nto rid myself of a sneaking fondness for Sir Eustace. I dare say\r\nit\u2019s reprehensible, but there it is. I admired him. He was a\r\nthorough-going villain, I dare say\u2014but he was a pleasant one. I\u2019ve\r\nnever met any one half so amusing since.\r\n\r\nI concealed my feelings, of course. Naturally Colonel Race would\r\nfeel quite differently about it. He wanted Sir Eustace brought to\r\njustice. There was nothing very surprising in his escape when one\r\ncame to think of it. All round Jo\u2019burg he must have innumerable\r\nspies and agents. And, whatever Colonel Race might think, I was\r\nexceedingly doubtful that they would ever catch him. He probably\r\nhad a well-planned line of retreat. Indeed, he had said as much to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nI expressed myself suitably, though in a rather lukewarm manner,\r\nand the conversation languished. Then Colonel Race asked suddenly\r\nfor Harry. I told him that he had gone off at dawn and that I\r\nhadn\u2019t seen him this morning.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou understand, don\u2019t you, Anne, that apart from formalities, he\r\nis completely cleared? There are technicalities, of course, but\r\nSir Eustace\u2019s guilt is well assured. There is nothing now to keep\r\nyou apart.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe said this without looking at me, in a slow, jerky voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cI understand,\u201d I said gratefully.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd there is no reason why he should not at once resume his real\r\nname.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know his real name?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe question surprised me.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course I do. Harry Lucas.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe did not answer, and something in the quality of his silence\r\nstruck me as peculiar.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnne, do you remember that, as we drove home from the Matoppos\r\nthat day, I told you that I knew what I had to do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course I remember.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that I may fairly say I have done it. The man you love is\r\ncleared of suspicion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas that what you meant?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\r\n\r\nI hung my head, ashamed of the baseless suspicion I had entertained.\r\nHe spoke again in a thoughtful voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I was a mere youngster, I was in love with a girl who jilted\r\nme. After that I thought only of my work. My career meant everything\r\nto me. Then I met you, Anne\u2014and all that seemed worth nothing. But\r\nyouth\u2019s call to youth. . . . I\u2019ve still got my work.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was silent. I suppose one can\u2019t really love two men at once\u2014but\r\nyou can feel like it. The magnetism of this man was very great. I\r\nlooked up at him suddenly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that you\u2019ll go very far,\u201d I said dreamily. \u201cI think that\r\nyou\u2019ve got a great career ahead of you. You\u2019ll be one of the\r\nworld\u2019s big men.\u201d\r\n\r\nI felt as though I was uttering a prophecy.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall be alone, though.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll the people who do really big things are.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure of it.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe took my hand and said in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d rather have had\u2014the other.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen Harry came striding round the corner of the house. Colonel\r\nRace rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood morning\u2014Lucas,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nFor some reason Harry flushed up to the roots of his hair.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said gaily, \u201cyou must be known by your real name now.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Harry was still staring at Colonel Race.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you know, sir,\u201d he said at last.\r\n\r\n\u201cI never forget a face. I saw you once as a boy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all this about?\u201d I asked, puzzled, looking from one to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a conflict of wills between them. Race won. Harry turned\r\nslightly away.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right, sir. Tell her my real name.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnne, this isn\u2019t Harry Lucas. Harry Lucas was killed in the War.\r\nThis is John Harold Eardsley.\u201d\r\n\nWith his last words Colonel Race had swung away and left us. I\r\nstood staring after him. Harry\u2019s voice recalled me to myself.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnne, forgive me, say you forgive me.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe took my hand in his and almost mechanically I drew it away.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you deceive me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I can make you understand. I was afraid of all\r\nthat sort of thing\u2014the power and fascination of wealth. I wanted\r\nyou to care for me just for myself\u2014for the man I was\u2014without\r\nornaments and trappings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean you didn\u2019t trust me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can put it that way if you like, but it isn\u2019t quite true. I\u2019d\r\nbecome embittered, suspicious\u2014always prone to look for ulterior\r\nmotives\u2014and it was so wonderful to be cared for in the way you\r\ncared for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d I said slowly. I was going over in my own mind the story\r\nhe had told me. For the first time I noted discrepancies in it\r\nwhich I had disregarded\u2014an assurance of money, the power to buy\r\nback the diamonds of Nadina, the way in which he had preferred to\r\nspeak of both men from the point of view of an outsider. And when\r\nhe had said \u201cmy friend\u201d he had meant, not Eardsley, but Lucas. It\r\nwas Lucas, the quiet fellow, who had loved Nadina so deeply.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did it come about?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were both reckless\u2014anxious to get killed. One night we exchanged\r\nidentification discs\u2014for luck! Lucas was killed the next day\u2014blown\r\nto pieces.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shuddered.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why didn\u2019t you tell me now? This morning? You couldn\u2019t have\r\ndoubted my caring for you by this time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnne, I didn\u2019t want to spoil it all. I wanted to take you back to\r\nthe island. What\u2019s the good of money? It can\u2019t buy happiness. We\u2019d\r\nhave been happy on the island. I tell you I\u2019m afraid of that other\r\nlife\u2014it nearly rotted me through once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid Sir Eustace know who you really were?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Carton?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. He saw us both with Nadina at Kimberley one night, but he\r\ndidn\u2019t know which was which. He accepted my statement that I was\r\nLucas, and Nadina was deceived by his cable. She was never afraid\r\nof Lucas. He was a quiet chap\u2014very deep. But I always had the\r\ndevil\u2019s own temper. She\u2019d have been scared out of her life if she\u2019d\r\nknown that I\u2019d come to life again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHarry, if Colonel Race hadn\u2019t told me, what did you mean to do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSay nothing. Go on as Lucas.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your father\u2019s millions?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRace was welcome to them. Anyway, he would make a better use of\r\nthem than I ever shall. Anne, what are you thinking about? You\u2019re\r\nfrowning so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking,\u201d I said slowly, \u201cthat I almost wish Colonel Race\r\nhadn\u2019t made you tell me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. He was right. I owed you the truth.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe paused, then said suddenly:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know, Anne, I\u2019m jealous of Race. He loves you too\u2014and he\u2019s a\r\nbigger man than I am or ever shall be.\u201d\r\n\r\nI turned to him, laughing.\r\n\r\n\u201cHarry, you idiot. It\u2019s you I want\u2014and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible we started for Cape Town. There Suzanne was\r\nwaiting to greet me, and we disembowelled the big giraffe together.\r\nWhen the Revolution was finally quelled, Colonel Race came down to\r\nCape Town and at his suggestion the big villa at Muizenberg that\r\nhad belonged to Sir Lawrence Eardsley was reopened and we all took\r\nup our abode in it.\r\n\r\nThere we made our plans. I was to return to England with Suzanne\r\nand to be married from her house in London. And the trousseau was\r\nto be bought in Paris! Suzanne enjoyed planning all these details\r\nenormously. So did I. And yet the future seemed curiously unreal.\r\nAnd sometimes, without knowing why, I felt absolutely stifled\u2014as\r\nthough I couldn\u2019t breathe.\r\n\r\nIt was the night before we were to sail. I couldn\u2019t sleep. I was\r\nmiserable, and I didn\u2019t know why. I hated leaving Africa. When I\r\ncame back to it, would it be the same thing? Would it ever be the\r\nsame thing again?\r\n\r\nAnd then I was startled by an authoritative rap on the shutter. I\r\nsprang up. Harry was on the _stoep_ outside.\r\n\r\n\u201cPut some clothes on, Anne, and come out. I want to speak to you.\u201d\r\n\r\nI huddled on a few garments, and stepped out into the cool night\r\nair\u2014still and scented, with its velvety feel. Harry beckoned me\r\nout of earshot of the house. His face looked pale and determined\r\nand his eyes were blazing.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnne, do you remember saying to me once that women enjoyed doing\r\nthe things they disliked for the sake of some one they liked?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, wondering what was coming.\r\n\r\nHe caught me in his arms.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnne, come away with me\u2014now\u2014to-night. Back to Rhodesia\u2014back to\r\nthe island. I can\u2019t stand all this tomfoolery. I can\u2019t wait for\r\nyou any longer.\u201d\r\n\r\nI disengaged myself a minute.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what about my French frocks?\u201d I lamented mockingly.\r\n\r\nTo this day Harry never knows when I\u2019m in earnest and when I\u2019m only\r\nteasing him.\r\n\r\n\u201cDamn your French frocks. Do you think I want to put frocks on you?\r\nI\u2019m a damned sight more likely to want to tear them off you. I\u2019m\r\nnot going to let you go, do you hear? You\u2019re my woman. If I let\r\nyou go away, I may lose you. I\u2019m never sure of you. You\u2019re coming\r\nwith me now\u2014to-night\u2014and damn everybody.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe held me to him, kissing me until I could hardly breathe.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t do without you any longer, Anne. I can\u2019t indeed. I hate\r\nall this money. Let Race have it. Come on. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy toothbrush?\u201d I demurred.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can buy one. I know I\u2019m a lunatic, but for God\u2019s sake, _come!\u201d_\r\n\r\nHe stalked off at a furious pace. I followed him as meekly as the\r\nBarotsi woman I had observed at the Falls. Only I wasn\u2019t carrying\r\na frying-pan on my head. He walked so fast that it was very\r\ndifficult to keep up with him.\r\n\r\n\u201cHarry,\u201d I said at last, in a meek voice, \u201care we going to walk\r\nall the way to Rhodesia?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe turned suddenly and with a great shout of laughter gathered me\r\nup in his arms.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m mad, sweetheart, I know it. But I do love you so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re a couple of lunatics. And, oh, Harry, you never asked me,\r\nbut I\u2019m not making a sacrifice at all! I _wanted_ to come!\u201d\r\n\nThat was two years ago. We still live on the island. Before me, on\r\nthe rough wooden table, is the letter that Suzanne wrote me.\r\n\r\nDear Babes in the Wood\u2014Dear Lunatics in Love,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not surprised\u2014not at all. All the time we\u2019ve been talking Paris\r\nand frocks I felt that it wasn\u2019t a bit real\u2014that you\u2019d vanish into\r\nthe blue some day to be married over the tongs in the good old\r\ngipsy fashion. But you _are_ a couple of lunatics! This idea of\r\nrenouncing a vast fortune is absurd. Colonel Race wanted to argue\r\nthe matter, but I have persuaded him to leave the argument to time.\r\nHe can administer the estate for Harry\u2014and none better. Because,\r\nafter all, honeymoons don\u2019t last forever\u2014you\u2019re not here, Anne, so\r\nI can safely say that without having you fly out at me like a\r\nlittle wild-cat\u2014Love in the wilderness will last a good while, but\r\none day you will suddenly begin to dream of houses in Park Lane,\r\nsumptuous furs, Paris frocks, the largest thing in motors and the\r\nlatest thing in perambulators, French maids and Norland nurses!\r\nOh, yes, you will!\r\n\r\nBut have your honeymoon, dear lunatics, and let it be a long one.\r\nAnd think of me sometimes, comfortably putting on weight amidst\r\nthe fleshpots!\r\n\r\nYour loving friend, Suzanne Blair.\r\n\r\nP.S.\u2014I am sending you an assortment of frying-pans as a wedding\r\npresent, and an enormous _terrine_ of _p\u00e2t\u00e9 de foie gras_ to remind\r\nyou of me.\r\n\r\nThere is another letter that I sometimes read. It came a good while\r\nafter the other and was accompanied by a bulky packet. It appeared\r\nto be written from somewhere in Bolivia.\r\n\r\nMy dear Anne Beddingfeld,\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t resist writing to you, not so much for the pleasure it\r\ngives me to write, as for the enormous pleasure I know it will give\r\nyou to hear from me. Our friend Race wasn\u2019t quite as clever as he\r\nthought himself, was he?\r\n\r\nI think I shall appoint you my literary executor. I\u2019m sending you\r\nmy diary. There\u2019s nothing in it that would interest Race and his\r\ncrowd, but I fancy that there are passages in it which may amuse\r\nyou. Make use of it in any way you like. I suggest an article for\r\nthe _Daily Budget,_ \u201cCriminals I have met.\u201d I only stipulate that\r\nI shall be the central figure.\r\n\r\nBy this time I have no doubt that you are no longer Anne Beddingfeld,\r\nbut Lady Eardsley, queening it in Park Lane. I should just like to\r\nsay that I bear you no malice whatever. It is hard, of course, to\r\nhave to begin all over again at my time of life, but, _entre nous,_\r\nI had a little reserve fund carefully put aside for such a\r\ncontingency. It has come in very usefully and I am getting together\r\na nice little connection. By the way, if you ever come across that\r\nfunny friend of yours, Arthur Minks, just tell him that I haven\u2019t\r\nforgotten him, will you? That will give him a nasty jar.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I think I have displayed a most Christian and forgiving\r\nspirit. Even to Pagett. I happened to hear that he\u2014or rather Mrs.\r\nPagett\u2014had brought a sixth child into the world the other day.\r\nEngland will be entirely populated by Pagetts soon. I sent the\r\nchild a silver mug, and, on a post card, declared my willingness\r\nto act as god-father. I can see Pagett taking both mug and post\r\ncard straight to Scotland Yard without a smile on his face!\r\n\r\nBless you, liquid eyes. Some day you will see what a mistake you\r\nhave made in not marrying me.\r\n\r\nYours ever,\r\n\r\nEustace Pedler.\r\n\r\nHarry was furious. It is the one point on which he and I do not\r\nsee eye to eye. To him, Sir Eustace was the man who tried to murder\r\nme and whom he regards as responsible for the death of his friend.\r\nSir Eustace\u2019s attempts on my life have always puzzled me. They are\r\nnot in the picture, so to speak. For I am sure that he always had\r\na genuinely kindly feeling towards me.\r\n\r\nThen why did he twice attempt to take my life? Harry says \u201cbecause\r\nhe\u2019s a damned scoundrel,\u201d and seems to think that settles the\r\nmatter. Suzanne was more discriminating. I talked it over with her,\r\nand she put it down to a \u201cfear complex.\u201d Suzanne goes in rather\r\nfor psycho-analysis. She pointed out to me that Sir Eustace\u2019s whole\r\nlife was actuated by a desire to be safe and comfortable. He had\r\nan acute sense of self-preservation. And the murder of Nadina\r\nremoved certain inhibitions. His actions did not represent the\r\nstate of his feeling towards me, but were the result of his acute\r\nfears for his own safety. I think Suzanne is right. As for Nadina,\r\nshe was the kind of woman who deserved to die. Men do all sorts of\r\nquestionable things in order to get rich, but women shouldn\u2019t\r\npretend to be in love when they aren\u2019t for ulterior motives.\r\n\r\nI can forgive Sir Eustace easily enough, but I shall never forgive\r\nNadina. Never, never, never!\r\n\r\nThe other day I was unpacking some tins that were wrapped in bits\r\nof an old _Daily Budget,_ and I suddenly came upon the words, \u201cThe\r\nMan in the Brown Suit.\u201d How long ago it seemed! I had, of course,\r\nsevered my connection with the _Daily Budget_ long ago\u2014I had done\r\nwith it sooner than it had done with me. _My Romantic Wedding_ was\r\ngiven a halo of publicity.\r\n\r\nMy son is lying in the sun, kicking his legs. There\u2019s a \u201cman in a\r\nbrown suit\u201d if you like. He\u2019s wearing as little as possible, which\r\nis the best costume for Africa, and is as brown as a berry. He\u2019s\r\nalways burrowing in the earth. I think he takes after Papa. He\u2019ll\r\nhave that same mania for Pleiocene clay.\r\n\r\nSuzanne sent me a cable when he was born:\r\n\r\n\u201cCongratulations and love to the latest arrival on Lunatics\u2019\r\nIsland. Is his head dolichocephalic or brachycephalic?\u201d\r\n\r\nI wasn\u2019t going to stand that from Suzanne. I sent her a reply of\r\none word, economical and to the point:\r\n\r\n\u201cPlatycephalic!\u201d\r\n\n", "The Murder on the Links": "I believe that a well-known anecdote exists to the effect that a young\r\nwriter, determined to make the commencement of his story forcible and\r\noriginal enough to catch and rivet the attention of the most blas\u00e9 of\r\neditors, penned the following sentence:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u200a\u2018Hell!\u2019 said the Duchess.\u201d\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, this tale of mine opens in much the same fashion.\r\nOnly the lady who gave utterance to the exclamation was not a Duchess!\r\n\r\nIt was a day in early June. I had been transacting some business in\r\nParis and was returning by the morning service to London where I was\r\nstill sharing rooms with my old friend, the Belgian ex-detective,\r\nHercule Poirot.\r\n\r\nThe Calais express was singularly empty\u2014in fact, my own compartment\r\nheld only one other traveller. I had made a somewhat hurried departure\r\nfrom the hotel and was busy assuring myself that I had duly collected\r\nall my traps when the train started. Up till then I had hardly noticed\r\nmy companion, but I was now violently recalled to the fact of her\r\nexistence. Jumping up from her seat, she let down the window and stuck\r\nher head out, withdrawing it a moment later with the brief and forcible\r\nejaculation \u201cHell!\u201d\r\n\r\nNow I am old-fashioned. A woman, I consider, should be womanly. I have\r\nno patience with the modern neurotic girl who jazzes from morning to\r\nnight, smokes like a chimney, and uses language which would make a\r\nBillingsgate fishwoman blush!\r\n\r\nI looked up now, frowning slightly, into a pretty, impudent face,\r\nsurmounted by a rakish little red hat. A thick cluster of black curls\r\nhid each ear. I judged that she was little more than seventeen, but her\r\nface was covered with powder, and her lips were quite impossibly\r\nscarlet.\r\n\r\nNothing abashed, she returned my glance, and executed an expressive\r\ngrimace.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me, we\u2019ve shocked the kind gentleman!\u201d she observed to an\r\nimaginary audience. \u201cI apologize for my language! Most unladylike, and\r\nall that, but Oh, Lord, there\u2019s reason enough for it! Do you know I\u2019ve\r\nlost my only sister?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d I said politely. \u201cHow unfortunate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe disapproves!\u201d remarked the lady. \u201cHe disapproves utterly\u2014of me, and\r\nmy sister\u2014which last is unfair, because he hasn\u2019t seen her!\u201d\r\n\r\nI opened my mouth, but she forestalled me.\r\n\r\n\u201cSay no more! Nobody loves me! I shall go into the garden and eat\r\nworms! Boohoo! I am crushed!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe buried herself behind a large comic French paper. In a minute or\r\ntwo I saw her eyes stealthily peeping at me over the top. In spite of\r\nmyself I could not help smiling, and in a minute she had tossed the\r\npaper aside, and had burst into a merry peal of laughter.\r\n\r\n\u201cI knew you weren\u2019t such a mutt as you looked,\u201d she cried.\r\n\r\nHer laughter was so infectious that I could not help joining in, though\r\nI hardly cared for the word \u201cmutt.\u201d The girl was certainly all that I\r\nmost disliked, but that was no reason why I should make myself\r\nridiculous by my attitude. I prepared to unbend. After all, she was\r\ndecidedly pretty.\u200a\u2026\r\n\r\n\u201cThere! Now we\u2019re friends!\u201d declared the minx. \u201cSay you\u2019re sorry about\r\nmy sister\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am desolated!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good boy!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me finish. I was going to add that, although I am desolated, I can\r\nmanage to put up with her absence very well.\u201d I made a little bow.\r\n\r\nBut this most unaccountable of damsels frowned and shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cCut it out. I prefer the \u2018dignified disapproval\u2019 stunt. Oh, your face!\r\n\u2018Not one of us,\u2019 it said. And you were right there\u2014though, mind you,\r\nit\u2019s pretty hard to tell nowadays. It\u2019s not every one who can\r\ndistinguish between a demi and a duchess. There now, I believe I\u2019ve\r\nshocked you again! You\u2019ve been dug out of the backwoods, you have. Not\r\nthat I mind that. We could do with a few more of your sort. I just hate\r\na fellow who gets fresh. It makes me mad.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head vigorously.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you like when you\u2019re mad?\u201d I inquired with a smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cA regular little devil! Don\u2019t care what I say, or what I do, either! I\r\nnearly did a chap in once. Yes, really. He\u2019d have deserved it too.\r\nItalian blood I\u2019ve got. I shall get into trouble one of these days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I begged, \u201cdon\u2019t get mad with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shan\u2019t. I like you\u2014did the first moment I set eyes on you. But you\r\nlooked so disapproving that I never thought we should make friends.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we have. Tell me something about yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m an actress. No\u2014not the kind you\u2019re thinking of, lunching at the\r\nSavoy covered with jewellery, and with their photograph in every paper\r\nsaying how much they love Madame So and So\u2019s face cream. I\u2019ve been on\r\nthe boards since I was a kid of six\u2014tumbling.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d I said puzzled.\r\n\r\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you seen child acrobats?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I understand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m American born, but I\u2019ve spent most of my life in England. We got a\r\nnew show now\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy sister and I. Sort of song and dance, and a bit of patter, and a\r\ndash of the old business thrown in. It\u2019s quite a new idea, and it hits\r\nthem every time. There\u2019s to be money in it\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nMy new acquaintance leaned forward, and discoursed volubly, a great\r\nmany of her terms being quite unintelligible to me. Yet I found myself\r\nevincing an increasing interest in her. She seemed such a curious\r\nmixture of child and woman. Though perfectly worldly-wise, and able, as\r\nshe expressed it, to take care of herself, there was yet something\r\ncuriously ingenuous in her single-minded attitude towards life, and her\r\nwhole-hearted determination to \u201cmake good.\u201d This glimpse of a world\r\nunknown to me was not without its charm, and I enjoyed seeing her vivid\r\nlittle face light up as she talked.\r\n\r\nWe passed through Amiens. The name awakened many memories. My companion\r\nseemed to have an intuitive knowledge of what was in my mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cThinking of the War?\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were through it, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPretty well. I was wounded once, and after the Somme they invalided me\r\nout altogether. I had a half fledged Army job for a bit. I\u2019m a sort of\r\nprivate secretary now to an M. P.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy! That\u2019s brainy!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t. There\u2019s really awfully little to do. Usually a couple of\r\nhours every day sees me through. It\u2019s dull work too. In fact, I don\u2019t\r\nknow what I should do if I hadn\u2019t got something to fall back upon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t say you collect bugs!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. I share rooms with a very interesting man. He\u2019s a Belgian\u2014an\r\nex-detective. He\u2019s set up as a private detective in London, and he\u2019s\r\ndoing extraordinarily well. He\u2019s really a very marvellous little man.\r\nTime and again he has proved to be right where the official police have\r\nfailed.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy companion listened with widening eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that interesting, now? I just adore crime. I go to all the\r\nmysteries on the movies. And when there\u2019s a murder on I just devour the\r\npapers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you remember the Styles Case?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me see, was that the old lady who was poisoned? Somewhere down in\r\nEssex?\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was Poirot\u2019s first big case. Undoubtedly, but for him, the\r\nmurderer would have escaped scot-free. It was a most wonderful bit of\r\ndetective work.\u201d\r\n\r\nWarming to my subject, I ran over the heads of the affair, working up\r\nto the triumphant and unexpected d\u00e9nouement. The girl listened\r\nspellbound. In fact, we were so absorbed that the train drew into\r\nCalais station before we realized it.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy goodness gracious me!\u201d cried my companion. \u201cWhere\u2019s my\r\npowder-puff?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe proceeded to bedaub her face liberally, and then applied a stick of\r\nlip salve to her lips, observing the effect in a small pocket glass,\r\nand betraying not the faintest sign of self-consciousness.\r\n\r\n\u201cI say,\u201d I hesitated. \u201cI dare say it\u2019s cheek on my part, but why do all\r\nthat sort of thing?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl paused in her operations, and stared at me with undisguised\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t as though you weren\u2019t so pretty that you can afford to do\r\nwithout it,\u201d I said stammeringly.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear boy! I\u2019ve got to do it. All the girls do. Think I want to look\r\nlike a little frump up from the country?\u201d She took one last look in the\r\nmirror, smiled approval, and put it and her vanity-box away in her bag.\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better. Keeping up appearances is a bit of a fag, I grant, but\r\nif a girl respects herself it\u2019s up to her not to let herself get\r\nslack.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo this essentially moral sentiment, I had no reply. A point of view\r\nmakes a great difference.\r\n\r\nI secured a couple of porters, and we alighted on the platform. My\r\ncompanion held out her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-bye, and I\u2019ll mind my language better in future.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, but surely you\u2019ll let me look after you on the boat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMayn\u2019t be on the boat. I\u2019ve got to see whether that sister of mine got\r\naboard after all anywhere. But thanks all the same.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, but we\u2019re going to meet again, surely? I\u2014\u201d I hesitated. \u201cI want to\r\nmeet your sister.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe both laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s real nice of you. I\u2019ll tell her what you say. But I don\u2019t fancy\r\nwe\u2019ll meet again. You\u2019ve been very good to me on the journey,\r\nespecially after I cheeked you as I did. But what your face expressed\r\nfirst thing is quite true. I\u2019m not your kind. And that brings\r\ntrouble\u2014_I___ know that well enough.\u200a\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\nHer face changed. For the moment all the light-hearted gaiety died out\r\nof it. It looked angry\u2014revengeful.\u200a\u2026\r\n\r\n\u201cSo good-bye,\u201d she finished, in a lighter tone.\r\n\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you even going to tell me your name?\u201d I cried, as she turned\r\naway.\r\n\r\nShe looked over her shoulder. A dimple appeared in each cheek. She was\r\nlike a lovely picture by Greuze.\r\n\r\n\u201cCinderella,\u201d she said, and laughed.\r\n\r\nBut little did I think when and how I should see Cinderella again.\r\n\nIt was five minutes past nine when I entered our joint sitting-room for\r\nbreakfast on the following morning.\r\n\r\nMy friend Poirot, exact to the minute as usual, was just tapping the\r\nshell of his second egg.\r\n\r\nHe beamed upon me as I entered.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have slept well, yes? You have recovered from the crossing so\r\nterrible? It is a marvel, almost you are exact this morning.\r\n_Pardon___, but your tie is not symmetrical. Permit that I rearrange\r\nhim.\u201d\r\n\r\nElsewhere, I have described Hercule Poirot. An extraordinary little\r\nman! Height, five feet four inches, egg-shaped head carried a little to\r\none side, eyes that shone green when he was excited, stiff military\r\nmoustache, air of dignity immense! He was neat and dandified in\r\nappearance. For neatness of any kind, he had an absolute passion. To\r\nsee an ornament set crooked, or a speck of dust, or a slight disarray\r\nin one\u2019s attire, was torture to the little man until he could ease his\r\nfeelings by remedying the matter. \u201cOrder\u201d and \u201cMethod\u201d were his gods.\r\nHe had a certain disdain for tangible evidence, such as footprints and\r\ncigarette ash, and would maintain that, taken by themselves, they would\r\nnever enable a detective to solve a problem. Then he would tap his\r\negg-shaped head with absurd complacency, and remark with great\r\nsatisfaction: \u201cThe true work, it is done from _within___. _The little\r\ngrey cells___\u2014remember always the little grey cells, _mon ami!___\u201d\r\n\r\nI slipped into my seat, and remarked idly, in answer to Poirot\u2019s\r\ngreeting, that an hour\u2019s sea passage from Calais to Dover could hardly\r\nbe dignified by the epithet \u201cterrible.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot waved his egg-spoon in vigorous refutation of my remark.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Du tout!___ If for an hour one experiences sensations and emotions of\r\nthe most terrible, one has lived many hours! Does not one of your\r\nEnglish poets say that time is counted, not by hours, but by\r\nheart-beats?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fancy Browning was referring to something more romantic than sea\r\nsickness, though.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause he was an Englishman, an Islander to whom _la Manche___ was\r\nnothing. Oh, you English! With _nous autres___ it is different. Figure\r\nto yourself that a lady of my acquaintance at the beginning of the war\r\nfled to Ostend. There she had a terrible crisis of the nerves.\r\nImpossible to escape further except by crossing the sea! And she had a\r\nhorror\u2014_mais une horreur!___\u2014of the sea! What was she to do? Daily _les\r\nBoches___ were drawing nearer. Imagine to yourself the terrible\r\nsituation!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did she do?\u201d I inquired curiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cFortunately her husband was _homme pratique___. He was also very calm,\r\nthe crises of the nerves, they affected him not. _Il l\u2019a emport\u00e9e\r\nsimplement!___ Naturally when she reached England she was prostrate,\r\nbut she still breathed.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head seriously. I composed my face as best I could.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he stiffened and pointed a dramatic finger at the toast rack.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, par exemple, c\u2019est trop fort!\u201d he cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis piece of toast. You remark him not?\u201d He whipped the offender out\r\nof the rack, and held it up for me to examine.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it square? No. Is it a triangle? Again no. Is it even round? No. Is\r\nit of any shape remotely pleasing to the eye? What symmetry have we\r\nhere? None.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s cut from a cottage loaf,\u201d I explained soothingly.\r\n\r\nPoirot threw me a withering glance.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat an intelligence has my friend Hastings!\u201d he exclaimed\r\nsarcastically. \u201cComprehend you not that I have forbidden such a loaf\u2014a\r\nloaf haphazard and shapeless, that no baker should permit himself to\r\nbake!\u201d\r\n\r\nI endeavoured to distract his mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnything interesting come by the post?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head with a dissatisfied air.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have not yet examined my letters, but nothing of interest arrives\r\nnowadays. The great criminals, the criminals of method, they do not\r\nexist. The cases I have been employed upon lately were _banal___ to the\r\nlast degree. In verity I am reduced to recovering lost lap-dogs for\r\nfashionable ladies! The last problem that presented any interest was\r\nthat intricate little affair of the Yardly diamond, and that was\u2014how\r\nmany months ago, my friend?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head despondently, and I roared with laughter.\r\n\r\n\u201cCheer up, Poirot, the luck will change. Open your letters. For all you\r\nknow, there may be a great Case looming on the horizon.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled, and taking up the neat little letter opener with which\r\nhe opened his correspondence he slit the tops of the several envelopes\r\nthat lay by his plate.\r\n\r\n\u201cA bill. Another bill. It is that I grow extravagant in my old age.\r\nAha! a note from Japp.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d pricked up my ears. The Scotland Yard Inspector had more than\r\nonce introduced us to an interesting case.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe merely thanks me (in his fashion) for a little point in the\r\nAberystwyth Case on which I was able to set him right. I am delighted\r\nto have been of service to him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow does he thank you?\u201d I asked curiously, for I knew my Japp.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is kind enough to say that I am a wonderful sport for my age, and\r\nthat he was glad to have had the chance of letting me in on the case.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was so typical of Japp, that I could not forbear a chuckle. Poirot\r\ncontinued to read his correspondence placidly.\r\n\r\n\u201cA suggestion that I should give a lecture to our local boy scouts. The\r\nCountess of Forfanock will be obliged if I will call and see her.\r\nAnother lap-dog without doubt! And now for the last. Ah\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked up, quick to notice the change of tone. Poirot was reading\r\nattentively. In a minute he tossed the sheet over to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is out of the ordinary, _mon ami___. Read for yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe letter was written on a foreign type of paper, in a bold\r\ncharacteristic hand:\r\n\r\n\u201cVilla Genevi\u00e8ve\r\nMerlinville-sur-Mer\r\nFrance\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201c_Dear Sir___,\r\n\u201cI am in need of the services of a detective and, for reasons which I\r\nwill give you later, do not wish to call in the official police. I have\r\nheard of you from several quarters, and all reports go to show that you\r\nare not only a man of decided ability, but one who also knows how to be\r\ndiscreet. I do not wish to trust details to the post, but, on account\r\nof a secret I possess, I go in daily fear of my life. I am convinced\r\nthat the danger is imminent, and therefore I beg that you will lose no\r\ntime in crossing to France. I will send a car to meet you at Calais, if\r\nyou will wire me when you are arriving. I shall be obliged if you will\r\ndrop all cases you have on hand, and devote yourself solely to my\r\ninterests. I am prepared to pay any compensation necessary. I shall\r\nprobably need your services for a considerable period of time, as it\r\nmay be necessary for you to go out to Santiago, where I spent several\r\nyears of my life. I shall be content for you to name your own fee.\r\n    \u201cAssuring you once more that the matter is _urgent___,\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYours faithfully\r\n\u201cP. T. RENAULD.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow the signature was a hastily scrawled line, almost illegible: \u201cFor\r\nGod\u2019s sake, come!\u201d\r\n\r\nI handed the letter back with quickened pulses.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt last!\u201d I said. \u201cHere is something distinctly out of the ordinary.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d said Poirot meditatively.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will go of course,\u201d I continued.\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded. He was thinking deeply. Finally he seemed to make up his\r\nmind, and glanced up at the clock. His face was very grave.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee you, my friend, there is no time to lose. The Continental express\r\nleaves Victoria at 11 o\u2019clock. Do not agitate yourself. There is plenty\r\nof time. We can allow ten minutes for discussion. You accompany me,\r\n_n\u2019est-ce pas?___\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou told me yourself that your employer needed you not for the next\r\nfew weeks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s all right. But this Mr. Renauld hints strongly that his\r\nbusiness is private.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTa-ta-ta. I will manage M. Renauld. By the way, I seem to know the\r\nname?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a well-known South American millionaire fellow. His name\u2019s\r\nRenauld. I don\u2019t know whether it could be the same.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut without doubt. That explains the mention of Santiago. Santiago is\r\nin Chile, and Chile it is in South America! Ah, but we progress\r\nfinely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me, Poirot,\u201d I said, my excitement rising, \u201cI smell some goodly\r\nshekels in this. If we succeed, we shall make our fortunes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not be too sure of that, my friend. A rich man and his money are\r\nnot so easily parted. Me, I have seen a well-known millionaire turn out\r\na tramful of people to seek for a dropped halfpenny.\u201d\r\n\r\nI acknowledged the wisdom of this.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn any case,\u201d continued Poirot, \u201cit is not the money which attracts me\r\nhere. Certainly it will be pleasant to have _carte blanche___ in our\r\ninvestigations; one can be sure that way of wasting no time, but it is\r\nsomething a little bizarre in this problem which arouses my interest.\r\nYou remarked the postscript? How did it strike you?\u201d\r\n\r\nI considered.\r\n\r\n\u201cClearly he wrote the letter keeping himself well in hand, but at the\r\nend his self-control snapped and, on the impulse of the moment, he\r\nscrawled those four desperate words.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut my friend shook his head energetically.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are in error. See you not that while the ink of the signature is\r\nnearly black, that of the postscript is quite pale?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d I said puzzled.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon Dieu, mon ami___, but use your little grey cells! Is it not\r\nobvious? M. Renauld wrote his letter. Without blotting it, he reread it\r\ncarefully. Then, not on impulse, but deliberately, he added those last\r\nwords, and blotted the sheet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Parbleu!___ so that it should produce the effect upon me that it has\r\nupon you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mais, oui___\u2014to make sure of my coming! He reread the letter and was\r\ndissatisfied. It was not strong enough!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe paused, and then added softly, his eyes shining with that green\r\nlight that always betokened inward excitement: \u201cAnd so, _mon ami___,\r\nsince that postscript was added, not on impulse, but soberly, in cold\r\nblood, the urgency is very great, and we must reach him as soon as\r\npossible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMerlinville,\u201d I murmured thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of it, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a quiet little place\u2014but chic! It lies about midway between\r\nBolougne and Calais. It is rapidly becoming the fashion. Rich English\r\npeople who wish to be quiet are taking it up. M. Renauld has a house in\r\nEngland, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, in Rutland Gate, as far as I remember. Also a big place in the\r\ncountry, somewhere in Hertfordshire. But I really know very little\r\nabout him, he doesn\u2019t do much in a social way. I believe he has large\r\nSouth American interests in the City, and has spent most of his life\r\nout in Chile and the Argentino.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we shall hear all details from the man himself. Come, let us\r\npack. A small suit-case each, and then a taxi to Victoria.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the Countess?\u201d I inquired with a smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! _je m\u2019en fiche!___ Her case was certainly not interesting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy so sure of that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause in that case she would have come, not written. A woman cannot\r\nwait\u2014always remember that, Hastings.\u201d\r\n\r\nEleven o\u2019clock saw our departure from Victoria on our way to Dover.\r\nBefore starting Poirot had despatched a telegram to Mr. Renauld giving\r\nthe time of our arrival at Calais. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t invested\r\nin a few bottles of some sea sick remedy, Poirot,\u201d I observed\r\nmaliciously, as I recalled our conversation at breakfast.\r\n\r\nMy friend, who was anxiously scanning the weather, turned a reproachful\r\nface upon me.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it that you have forgotten the method most excellent of Laverguier?\r\nHis system, I practise it always. One balances oneself, if you\r\nremember, turning the head from left to right, breathing in and out,\r\ncounting six between each breath.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cH\u2019m,\u201d I demurred. \u201cYou\u2019ll be rather tired of balancing yourself and\r\ncounting six by the time you get to Santiago, or Buenos Ayres, or\r\nwherever it is you land.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Quelle id\u00e9e!___ You do not figure to yourself that I shall go to\r\nSantiago?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Renauld suggests it in his letter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe did not know the methods of Hercule Poirot. I do not run to and\r\nfro, making journeys, and agitating myself. My work is done from\r\nwithin\u2014_here___\u2014\u201d he tapped his forehead significantly.\r\n\r\nAs usual, this remark roused my argumentative faculty.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very well, Poirot, but I think you are falling into the habit\r\nof despising certain things too much. A finger-print has led sometimes\r\nto the arrest and conviction of a murderer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd has, without doubt, hanged more than one innocent man,\u201d remarked\r\nPoirot dryly.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut surely the study of finger-prints and footprints, cigarette ash,\r\ndifferent kinds of mud, and other clues that comprise the minute\r\nobservation of details\u2014all these are of vital importance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut certainly. I have never said otherwise. The trained observer, the\r\nexpert, without doubt he is useful! But the others, the Hercules\r\nPoirots, they are above the experts! To them the experts bring the\r\nfacts, their business is the method of the crime, its logical\r\ndeduction, the proper sequence and order of the facts; above all, the\r\ntrue psychology of the case. You have hunted the fox, yes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have hunted a bit, now and again,\u201d I said, rather bewildered by this\r\nabrupt change of subject. \u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien___, this hunting of the fox, you need the dogs, no?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHounds,\u201d I corrected gently. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut yet,\u201d Poirot wagged his finger at me. \u201cYou did not descend from\r\nyour horse and run along the ground smelling with your nose and\r\nuttering loud Ow Ows?\u201d\r\n\r\nIn spite of myself I laughed immoderately. Poirot nodded in a satisfied\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo. You leave the work of the d\u2014 hounds to the hounds. Yet you demand\r\nthat I, Hercule Poirot, should make myself ridiculous by lying down\r\n(possibly on damp grass) to study hypothetical footprints, and should\r\nscoop up cigarette ash when I do not know one kind from the other.\r\nRemember the Plymouth Express mystery. The good Japp departed to make a\r\nsurvey of the railway line. When he returned, I, without having moved\r\nfrom my apartments, was able to tell him exactly what he had found.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you are of the opinion that Japp wasted his time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all, since his evidence confirmed my theory. But _I___ should\r\nhave wasted my time if _I___ had gone. It is the same with so called\r\n\u2018experts.\u2019 Remember the handwriting testimony in the Cavendish Case.\r\nOne counsel\u2019s questioning brings out testimony as to the resemblances,\r\nthe defence brings evidence to show dissimilarity. All the language is\r\nvery technical. And the result? What we all knew in the first place.\r\nThe writing was very like that of John Cavendish. And the psychological\r\nmind is faced with the question \u2018Why?\u2019 Because it was actually his? Or\r\nbecause some one wished us to think it was his? I answered that\r\nquestion, _mon ami___, and answered it correctly.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd Poirot, having effectually silenced, if not convinced me, leaned\r\nback with a satisfied air.\r\n\r\nOn the boat, I knew better than to disturb my friend\u2019s solitude. The\r\nweather was gorgeous, and the sea as smooth as the proverbial\r\nmill-pond, so I was hardly surprised to hear that Laverguier\u2019s method\r\nhad once more justified itself when a smiling Poirot joined me on\r\ndisembarking at Calais. A disappointment was in store for us, as no car\r\nhad been sent to meet us, but Poirot put this down to his telegram\r\nhaving been delayed in transit.\r\n\r\n\u201cSince it is _carte blanche___, we will hire a car,\u201d he said\r\ncheerfully. And a few minutes later saw us creaking and jolting along,\r\nin the most ramshackle of automobiles that ever plied for hire, in the\r\ndirection of Merlinville.\r\n\r\nMy spirits were at their highest.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat gorgeous air!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cThis promises to be a delightful\r\ntrip.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor you, yes. For me, I have work to do, remember, at our journey\u2019s\r\nend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBah!\u201d I said cheerfully. \u201cYou will discover all, ensure this Mr.\r\nRenauld\u2019s safety, run the would-be assassins to earth, and all will\r\nfinish in a blaze of glory.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are sanguine, my friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I feel absolutely assured of success. Are you not the one and\r\nonly Hercule Poirot?\u201d\r\n\r\nBut my little friend did not rise to the bait. He was observing me\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are what the Scotch people call \u2018fey,\u2019 Hastings. It presages\r\ndisaster.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNonsense. At any rate, you do not share my feelings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but I am afraid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAfraid of what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know. But I have a premonition\u2014a _je ne sais quoi!___\u201d\r\n\r\nHe spoke so gravely, that I was impressed in spite of myself.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have a feeling,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cthat this is going to be a big\r\naffair\u2014a long, troublesome problem that will not be easy to work out.\u201d\r\n\r\nI would have questioned him further, but we were just coming into the\r\nlittle town of Merlinville, and we slowed up to inquire the way to the\r\nVilla Genevi\u00e8ve.\r\n\r\n\u201cStraight on, monsieur, through the town. The Villa Genevi\u00e8ve is about\r\nhalf a mile the other side. You cannot miss it. A big Villa,\r\noverlooking the sea.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe thanked our informant, and drove on, leaving the town behind. A fork\r\nin the road brought us to a second halt. A peasant was trudging towards\r\nus, and we waited for him to come up to us in order to ask the way\r\nagain. There was a tiny Villa standing right by the road, but it was\r\ntoo small and dilapidated to be the one we wanted. As we waited, the\r\ngate of it swung open and a girl came out.\r\n\r\nThe peasant was passing us now, and the driver leaned forward from his\r\nseat and asked for direction.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Villa Genevi\u00e8ve? Just a few steps up this road to the right,\r\nmonsieur. You could see it if it were not for the curve.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe chauffeur thanked him, and started the car again. My eyes were\r\nfascinated by the girl who still stood, with one hand on the gate,\r\nwatching us. I am an admirer of beauty, and here was one whom nobody\r\ncould have passed without remark. Very tall, with the proportions of a\r\nyoung goddess, her uncovered golden head gleaming in the sunlight, I\r\nswore to myself that she was one of the most beautiful girls I had ever\r\nseen. As we swung up the rough road, I turned my head to look after\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy Jove, Poirot,\u201d I exclaimed, \u201cdid you see that young goddess.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot raised his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\u201c_\u00c7a commence!___\u201d he murmured. \u201cAlready you have seen a goddess!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, hang it all, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPossibly. I did not remark the fact.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely you noticed her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon ami___, two people rarely see the same thing. You, for instance,\r\nsaw a goddess. I\u2014\u201d he hesitated.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw only a girl with anxious eyes,\u201d said Poirot gravely.\r\n\r\nBut at that moment we drew up at a big green gate, and, simultaneously,\r\nwe both uttered an exclamation. Before it stood an imposing _sergent de\r\nville___. He held up his hand to bar our way.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou cannot pass, monsieurs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut we wish to see Mr. Renauld,\u201d I cried. \u201cWe have an appointment.\r\nThis is his Villa, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, monsieur, but\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot leaned forward.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cM. Renauld was murdered this morning.\u201d\r\n\nIn a moment Poirot had leapt from the car, his eyes blazing with\r\nexcitement. He caught the man by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is that you say? Murdered? When? How?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe _sergent de ville___ drew himself up.\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot answer any questions, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue. I comprehend.\u201d Poirot reflected for a minute. \u201cThe Commissary of\r\nPolice, he is without doubt within?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot took out a card, and scribbled a few words on it.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Voil\u00e0!___ Will you have the goodness to see that this card is sent in\r\nto the commissary at once?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man took it and, turning his head over his shoulder, whistled. In a\r\nfew seconds a comrade joined him and was handed Poirot\u2019s message. There\r\nwas a wait of some minutes, and then a short stout man with a huge\r\nmoustache came bustling down to the gate. The _sergent de ville___\r\nsaluted and stood aside.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear M. Poirot,\u201d cried the new-comer, \u201cI am delighted to see you.\r\nYour arrival is most opportune.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot\u2019s face had lighted up.\r\n\r\n\u201cM. Bex! This is indeed a pleasure.\u201d He turned to me. \u201cThis is an\r\nEnglish friend of mine, Captain Hastings\u2014M. Lucien Bex.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe commissary and I bowed to each other ceremoniously, then M. Bex\r\nturned once more to Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon vieux___, I have not seen you since 1909, that time in Ostend. I\r\nheard that you had left the Force?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I have. I run a private business in London.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you say you have information to give which may assist us?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPossibly you know it already. You were aware that I had been sent\r\nfor?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. By whom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe dead man. It seems he knew an attempt was going to be made on his\r\nlife. Unfortunately he sent for me too late.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Sacri tonnerre!___\u201d ejaculated the Frenchman. \u201cSo he foresaw his own\r\nmurder? That upsets our theories considerably! But come inside.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe held the gate open, and we commenced walking towards the house. M.\r\nBex continued to talk:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe examining magistrate, M. Hautet, must hear of this at once. He has\r\njust finished examining the scene of the crime and is about to begin\r\nhis interrogations. A charming man. You will like him. Most\r\nsympathetic. Original in his methods, but an excellent judge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen was the crime committed?\u201d asked Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe body was discovered this morning about nine o\u2019clock. Madame\r\nRenauld\u2019s evidence, and that of the doctors goes to show that the death\r\nmust have occurred about 2 a.m. But enter, I pray of you.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe had arrived at the steps which led up to the front door of the\r\nVilla. In the hall another _sergent de ville___ was sitting. He rose at\r\nsight of the commissary.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is M. Hautet now?\u201d inquired the latter.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the _salon___, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\nM. Bex opened a door to the left of the hall, and we passed in. M.\r\nHautet and his clerk were sitting at a big round table. They looked up\r\nas we entered. The commissary introduced us, and explained our\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nM. Hautet, the Juge d\u2019Instruction, was a tall, gaunt man, with piercing\r\ndark eyes, and a neatly cut grey beard, which he had a habit of\r\ncaressing as he talked. Standing by the mantelpiece was an elderly man,\r\nwith slightly stooping shoulders, who was introduced to us as Dr.\r\nDurand.\r\n\r\n\u201cMost extraordinary,\u201d remarked M. Hautet, as the commissary finished\r\nspeaking. \u201cYou have the letter here, monsieur?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot handed it to him, and the magistrate read it.\r\n\r\n\u201cH\u2019m. He speaks of a secret. What a pity he was not more explicit. We\r\nare much indebted to you, M. Poirot. I hope you will do us the honour\r\nof assisting us in our investigations. Or are you obliged to return to\r\nLondon?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cM. le juge, I propose to remain. I did not arrive in time to prevent\r\nmy client\u2019s death, but I feel myself bound in honour to discover the\r\nassassin.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe magistrate bowed.\r\n\r\n\u201cThese sentiments do you honour. Also, without doubt, Madame Renauld\r\nwill wish to retain your services. We are expecting M. Giraud from the\r\nS\u00fbret\u00e9 in Paris any moment, and I am sure that you and he will be able\r\nto give each other mutual assistance in your investigations. In the\r\nmeantime, I hope that you will do me the honour to be present at my\r\ninterrogations, and I need hardly say that if there is any assistance\r\nyou require it is at your disposal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thank you, monsieur. You will comprehend that at present I am\r\ncompletely in the dark. I know nothing whatever.\u201d\r\n\r\nM. Hautet nodded to the commissary, and the latter took up the tale:\r\n\r\n\u201cThis morning, the old servant Fran\u00e7oise, on descending to start her\r\nwork, found the front door ajar. Feeling a momentary alarm as to\r\nburglars, she looked into the dining-room, but seeing the silver was\r\nsafe she thought no more about it, concluding that her master had,\r\nwithout doubt, risen early, and gone for a stroll.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPardon, monsieur, for interrupting, but was that a common practice of\r\nhis?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it was not, but old Fran\u00e7oise has the common idea as regards the\r\nEnglish\u2014that they are mad, and liable to do the most unaccountable\r\nthings at any moment! Going to call her mistress as usual, a younger\r\nmaid, L\u00e9onie, was horrified to discover her gagged and bound, and\r\nalmost at the same moment news was brought that M. Renauld\u2019s body had\r\nbeen discovered, stone dead, stabbed in the back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is one of the most extraordinary features of the case. M. Poirot,\r\nthe body was lying, face downwards, _in an open grave___.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. The pit was freshly dug\u2014just a few yards outside the boundary of\r\nthe Villa grounds.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd he had been dead\u2014how long?\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Durand answered this.\r\n\r\n\u201cI examined the body this morning at ten o\u2019clock. Death must have taken\r\nplace at least seven, and possibly ten hours previously.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cH\u2019m, that fixes it at between midnight and 3 a.m.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly, and Madame Renauld\u2019s evidence places it at after 2 a.m. which\r\nnarrows the field still further. Death must have been instantaneous,\r\nand naturally could not have been self-inflicted.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded, and the commissary resumed:\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame Renauld was hastily freed from the cords that bound her by the\r\nhorrified servants. She was in a terrible condition of weakness, almost\r\nunconscious from the pain of her bonds. It appears that two masked men\r\nentered the bedroom, gagged and bound her, whilst forcibly abducting\r\nher husband. This we know at second hand from the servants. On hearing\r\nthe tragic news, she fell at once into an alarming state of agitation.\r\nOn arrival, Dr. Durand immediately prescribed a sedative, and we have\r\nnot yet been able to question her. But without doubt she will awake\r\nmore calm, and be equal to bearing the strain of the interrogation.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe commissary paused.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the inmates of the house, monsieur?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is old Fran\u00e7oise, the housekeeper, she lived for many years with\r\nthe former owners of the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve. Then there are two young\r\ngirls, sisters, Denise and L\u00e9onie Oulard. Their home is in Merlinville,\r\nand they come of the most respectable parents. Then there is the\r\nchauffeur whom M. Renauld brought over from England with him, but he is\r\naway on a holiday. Finally there are Madame Renauld and her son, M.\r\nJack Renauld. He, too, is away from home at present.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot bowed his head. M. Hautet spoke:\r\n\r\n\u201cMarchaud!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe _sergent de ville___ appeared.\r\n\r\n\u201cBring in the woman Fran\u00e7oise.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man saluted, and disappeared. In a moment or two, he returned,\r\nescorting the frightened Fran\u00e7oise.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou name is Fran\u00e7oise Arrichet?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have been a long time in service at the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEleven years with Madame la Vicomtesse. Then when she sold the Villa\r\nthis spring, I consented to remain on with the English milor. Never did\r\nI imagine\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nThe magistrate cut her short.\r\n\r\n\u201cWithout doubt, without doubt. Now, Fran\u00e7oise, in this matter of the\r\nfront door, whose business was it to fasten it at night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMine, monsieur. Always I saw to it myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd last night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fastened it as usual.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are sure of that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI swear it by the blessed saints, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat time would that be?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe same time as usual, half-past ten, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about the rest of the household, had they gone up to bed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame had retired some time before. Denise and L\u00e9onie went up with\r\nme. Monsieur was still in his study.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, if any one unfastened the door afterwards, it must have been M.\r\nRenauld himself?\u201d\r\n\r\nFran\u00e7oise shrugged her broad shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat should he do that for? With robbers and assassins passing every\r\nminute! A nice idea! Monsieur was not an imbecile. It is not as though\r\nhe had had to let _cette dame___ out\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nThe magistrate interrupted sharply:\r\n\r\n\u201c_Cette dame?___ What lady do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, the lady who came to see him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHad a lady been to see him that evening?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut yes, monsieur\u2014and many other evenings as well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho was she? Did you know her?\u201d\r\n\r\nA rather cunning look spread over the woman\u2019s face. \u201cHow should I know\r\nwho it was?\u201d she grumbled. \u201cI did not let her in last night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAha!\u201d roared the examining magistrate, bringing his hand down with a\r\nbang on the table. \u201cYou would trifle with the police, would you? I\r\ndemand that you tell me at once the name of this woman who came to\r\nvisit M. Renauld in the evenings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe police\u2014the police,\u201d grumbled Fran\u00e7oise. \u201cNever did I think that I\r\nshould be mixed up with the police. But I know well enough who she was.\r\nIt was Madame Daubreuil.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe commissary uttered an exclamation, and leaned forward as though in\r\nutter astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame Daubreuil\u2014from the Villa Marguerite just down the road?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is what I said, monsieur. Oh, she is a pretty one, _cellela!___\u201d\r\nThe old woman tossed her head scornfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame Daubreuil,\u201d murmured the commissary. \u201cImpossible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Voil\u00e0,___\u201d grumbled Fran\u00e7oise. \u201cThat is all you get for telling the\r\ntruth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d said the examining magistrate soothingly. \u201cWe were\r\nsurprised, that is all. Madame Daubreuil then, and Monsieur Renauld,\r\nthey were\u2014\u201d he paused delicately. \u201cEh? It was that without doubt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow should I know? But what will you? Monsieur, he was _milor\r\nanglais___\u2014_tr\u00e9s riche___\u2014and Madame Daubreuil, she was poor, that\r\none\u2014and _tr\u00e9s chic___ for all that she lives so quietly with her\r\ndaughter. Not a doubt of it, she has had her history! She is no longer\r\nyoung, but _ma foi!___ I who speak to you have seen the men\u2019s heads\r\nturn after her as she goes down the street. Besides lately, she has had\r\nmore money to spend\u2014all the town knows it. The little economies, they\r\nare at an end.\u201d And Fran\u00e7oise shook her head with an air of unalterable\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nM. Hautet stroked his beard reflectively.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Madame Renauld?\u201d he asked at length. \u201cHow did she take\r\nthis\u2014friendship.\u201d\r\n\r\nFran\u00e7oise shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was always most amiable\u2014most polite. One would say that she\r\nsuspected nothing. But all the same, is it not so, the heart suffers,\r\nmonsieur? Day by day, I have watched Madame grow paler and thinner. She\r\nwas not the same woman who arrived here a month ago. Monsieur, too, has\r\nchanged. He also has had his worries. One could see that he was on the\r\nbrink of a crisis of the nerves. And who could wonder, with an affair\r\nconducted such a fashion? No reticence, no discretion. _Style\r\nanglais___, without doubt!\u201d\r\n\r\nI bounded indignantly in my seat, but the examining magistrate was\r\ncontinuing his questions, undistracted by side issues.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou say that M. Renauld had not to let Madame Daubreuil out? Had she\r\nleft, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, monsieur. I heard them come out of the study and go to the door.\r\nMonsieur said good night, and shut the door after her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat time was that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout twenty-five minutes after ten, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know when M. Renauld went to bed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI heard him come up about ten minutes after we did. The stair creaks\r\nso that one hears every one who goes up and down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that is all? You heard no sound of disturbance during the night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing whatever, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich of the servants came down the first in the morning?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did, monsieur. At once I saw the door swinging open.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about the other downstairs windows, were they all fastened?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery one of them. There was nothing suspicious or out of place\r\nanywhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood, Fran\u00e7oise, you can go.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old woman shuffled towards the door. On the threshold she looked\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will tell you one thing, monsieur. That Madame Daubreuil she is a\r\nbad one! Oh, yes, one woman knows about another. She is a bad one,\r\nremember that.\u201d And, shaking her head sagely, Fran\u00e7oise left the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cL\u00e9onie Oulard,\u201d called the magistrate.\r\n\r\nL\u00e9onie appeared dissolved in tears, and inclined to be hysterical. M.\r\nHautet dealt with her adroitly. Her evidence was mainly concerned with\r\nthe discovery of her mistress gagged and bound, of which she gave\r\nrather an exaggerated account. She, like Fran\u00e7oise, had heard nothing\r\nduring the night.\r\n\r\nHer sister, Denise, succeeded her. She agreed that her master had\r\nchanged greatly of late.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery day he became more and more morose. He ate less. He was always\r\ndepressed.\u201d But Denise had her own theory. \u201cWithout doubt it was the\r\nMafia he had on his track! Two masked men\u2014who else could it be? A\r\nterrible society that!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is, of course, possible,\u201d said the magistrate smoothly. \u201cNow, my\r\ngirl, was it you who admitted Madame Daubreuil to the house last\r\nnight?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot _last___ night, monsieur, the night before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut Fran\u00e7oise has just told us that Madame Daubreuil was here last\r\nnight?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, monsieur. A lady _did___ come to see M. Renauld last night, but it\r\nwas not Madame Daubreuil.\u201d\r\n\r\nSurprised, the magistrate insisted, but the girl held firm. She knew\r\nMadame Daubreuil perfectly by sight. This lady was dark also, but\r\nshorter, and much younger. Nothing could shake her statement.\r\n\r\n\u201cHad you ever seen this lady before?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever, monsieur.\u201d And then the girl added diffidently: \u201cBut I think\r\nshe was English.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEnglish?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, monsieur. She asked for M. Renauld in quite good French, but the\r\naccent\u2014one can always tell it, _n\u2019est-ce pas?___ Besides when they came\r\nout of the study they were speaking in English.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you hear what they said? Could you understand it, I mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMe, I speak the English very well,\u201d said Denise with pride. \u201cThe lady\r\nwas speaking too fast for me to catch what she said, but I heard\r\nMonsieur\u2019s last words as he opened the door for her.\u201d She paused, and\r\nthen repeated carefully and laboriously:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u200a\u2018Yeas\u2014yeas\u2014butt for Gaud\u2019s saike go nauw!\u2019\u200a\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes, but for God\u2019s sake go now!\u201d repeated the magistrate.\r\n\r\nHe dismissed Denise and, after a moment or two for consideration,\r\nrecalled Fran\u00e7oise. To her he propounded the question as to whether she\r\nhad not made a mistake in fixing the night of Madame Daubreuil\u2019s visit.\r\nFran\u00e7oise, however, proved unexpectedly obstinate. It was last night\r\nthat Madame Daubreuil had come. Without a doubt it was she. Denise\r\nwished to make herself interesting, _voil\u00e0 tout!___ So she had cooked\r\nup this fine tale about a strange lady. Airing her knowledge of English\r\ntoo! Probably Monsieur had never spoken that sentence in English at\r\nall, and even if he had, it proved nothing, for Madame Daubreuil spoke\r\nEnglish perfectly, and generally used that language when talking to M.\r\nand Madame Renauld. \u201cYou see, M. Jack, the son of Monsieur, was usually\r\nhere, and he spoke the French very badly.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe magistrate did not insist. Instead he inquired about the chauffeur,\r\nand learned that only yesterday, M. Renauld had declared that he was\r\nnot likely to use the car, and that Masters might just as well take a\r\nholiday.\r\n\r\nA perplexed frown was beginning to gather between Poirot\u2019s eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I whispered.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head impatiently, and asked a question:\r\n\r\n\u201cPardon, M. Bex, but without doubt M. Renauld could drive the car\r\nhimself?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe commissary looked over at Fran\u00e7oise, and the old woman replied\r\npromptly:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, Monsieur did not drive himself.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot\u2019s frown deepened.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish you would tell me what is worrying you,\u201d I said impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee you not? In his letter M. Renauld speaks of sending the car for me\r\nto Calais.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps he meant a hired car,\u201d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\u201cDoubtless that is so. But why hire a car when you have one of your\r\nown. Why choose yesterday to send away the chauffeur on a\r\nholiday\u2014suddenly, at a moment\u2019s notice? Was it that for some reason he\r\nwanted him out of the way before we arrived?\u201d\r\n\nFran\u00e7oise had left the room. The magistrate was drumming thoughtfully\r\non the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cM. Bex,\u201d he said at length, \u201chere we have directly conflicting\r\ntestimony. Which are we to believe, Fran\u00e7oise or Denise?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDenise,\u201d said the commissary decidedly. \u201cIt was she who let the\r\nvisitor in. Fran\u00e7oise is old and obstinate, and has evidently taken a\r\ndislike to Madame Daubreuil. Besides, our own knowledge tends to show\r\nthat Renauld was entangled with another woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Tiens!___\u201d cried M. Hautet. \u201cWe have forgotten to inform M. Poirot of\r\nthat.\u201d He searched amongst the papers on the table, and finally handed\r\nthe one he was in search of to my friend. \u201cThis letter, M. Poirot, we\r\nfound in the pocket of the dead man\u2019s overcoat.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot took it and unfolded it. It was somewhat worn and crumbled, and\r\nwas written in English in a rather unformed hand:\r\n\r\n\u201c_My dearest one:___\u201d\r\nWhy have you not written for so long? You do love me still, don\u2019t you?\r\nYour letters lately have been so different, cold and strange, and now\r\nthis long silence. It makes me afraid. If you were to stop loving me!\r\nBut that\u2019s impossible\u2014what a silly kid I am\u2014always imagining things!\r\nBut if you _did___ stop loving me, I don\u2019t know what I should do\u2014kill\r\nmyself perhaps! I couldn\u2019t live without you. Sometimes I fancy another\r\nwoman is coming between us. Let her look out, that\u2019s all\u2014and you too!\r\nI\u2019d as soon kill you as let her have you! I mean it.\r\n    \u201cBut there, I\u2019m writing high-flown nonsense. You love me, and I\r\n    love you\u2014yes, love you, love you, love you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYour own adoring\r\n\u201cBELLA.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no address or date. Poirot handed it back with a grave face.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the assumption is, M. le juge\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe examining magistrate shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cObviously M. Renauld was entangled with this Englishwoman\u2014Bella. He\r\ncomes over here, meets Madame Daubreuil, and starts an intrigue with\r\nher. He cools off to the other, and she instantly suspects something.\r\nThis letter contains a distinct threat. M. Poirot, at first sight the\r\ncase seemed simplicity itself. Jealousy! The fact that M. Renauld was\r\nstabbed in the back seemed to point distinctly to its being a woman\u2019s\r\ncrime.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe stab in the back, yes\u2014but not the grave! That was laborious work,\r\nhard work\u2014no woman dug that grave, monsieur. That was a man\u2019s doing.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe commissary exclaimed excitedly: \u201cYes, yes, you are right. We did\r\nnot think of that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I said,\u201d continued M. Hautet, \u201cat first sight the case seemed\r\nsimple, but the masked men, and the letter you received from M. Renauld\r\ncomplicate matters. Here we seem to have an entirely different set of\r\ncircumstances, with no relationship between the two. As regards the\r\nletter written to yourself, do you think it is possible that it\r\nreferred in any way to this \u2018Bella,\u2019 and her threats?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cHardly. A man like M. Renauld, who has led an adventurous life in\r\nout-of-the-way places, would not be likely to ask for protection\r\nagainst a woman.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe examining magistrate nodded his head emphatically.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy view exactly. Then we must look for the explanation of the letter\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn Santiago,\u201d finished the commissary. \u201cI shall cable without delay to\r\nthe police in that city, requesting full details of the murdered man\u2019s\r\nlife out there, his love affairs, his business transactions, his\r\nfriendships, and any enmities he may have incurred. It will be strange\r\nif, after that, we do not hold a clue to his mysterious murder.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe commissary looked round for approval.\r\n\r\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d said Poirot appreciatively.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis wife, too, may be able to give us a pointer,\u201d added the\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have found no other letters from this Bella amongst M. Renauld\u2019s\r\neffects?\u201d asked Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. Of course one of our first proceedings was to search through his\r\nprivate papers in the study. We found nothing of interest, however. All\r\nseemed square and above-board. The only thing at all out of the\r\nordinary was his will. Here it is.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot ran through the document.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo. A legacy of a thousand pounds to Mr. Stonor\u2014who is he, by the\r\nway?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cM. Renauld\u2019s secretary. He remained in England, but was over here once\r\nor twice for a week-end.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd everything else left unconditionally to his beloved wife, Eloise.\r\nSimply drawn up, but perfectly legal. Witnessed by the two servants,\r\nDenise and Fran\u00e7oise. Nothing so very unusual about that.\u201d He handed it\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d began Bex, \u201cyou did not notice\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe date?\u201d twinkled Poirot. \u201cBut yes, I noticed it. A fortnight ago.\r\nPossibly it marks his first intimation of danger. Many rich men die\r\nintestate through never considering the likelihood of their demise. But\r\nit is dangerous to draw conclusions prematurely. It points, however, to\r\nhis having a real liking and fondness for his wife, in spite of his\r\namorous intrigues.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said M. Hautet doubtfully. \u201cBut it is possibly a little unfair\r\non his son, since it leaves him entirely dependent on his mother. If\r\nshe were to marry again, and her second husband obtained an ascendancy\r\nover her, this boy might never touch a penny of his father\u2019s money.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cMan is a vain animal. M. Renauld figured to himself, without doubt,\r\nthat his widow would never marry again. As to the son, it may have been\r\na wise precaution to leave the money in his mother\u2019s hands. The sons of\r\nrich men are proverbially wild.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may be as you say. Now, M. Poirot, you would without doubt like to\r\nvisit the scene of the crime. I am sorry that the body has been\r\nremoved, but of course photographs have been taken from every\r\nconceivable angle, and will be at your disposal as soon as they are\r\navailable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thank you, monsieur, for all your courtesy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe commissary rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome with me, monsieurs.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe opened the door, and bowed ceremoniously to Poirot to precede him.\r\nPoirot, with equal politeness, drew back and bowed to the commissary.\r\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt last they got out into the hall.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat room there, it is the study, _hein?___\u201d asked Poirot suddenly,\r\nnodding towards the door opposite.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. You would like to see it?\u201d He threw the door open as he spoke,\r\nand we entered.\r\n\r\nThe room which M. Renauld had chosen for his own particular use was\r\nsmall, but furnished with great taste and comfort. A businesslike\r\nwriting desk, with many pigeon holes, stood in the window. Two large\r\nleather-covered armchairs faced the fireplace, and between them was a\r\nround table covered with the latest books and magazines. Bookshelves\r\nlined two of the walls, and at the end of the room opposite the window\r\nthere was a handsome oak sideboard with a tantalus on top. The curtains\r\nand _porti\u00e8re___ were of a soft dull green, and the carpet matched them\r\nin tone.\r\n\r\nPoirot stood a moment talking in the room, then he stepped forward,\r\npassed his hand lightly over the backs of the leather chairs, picked up\r\na magazine from the table, and drew a finger gingerly over the surface\r\nof the oak sideboard. His face expressed complete approval.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo dust?\u201d I asked, with a smile.\r\n\r\nHe beamed on me, appreciative of my knowledge of his peculiarities.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a particle, _mon ami!___ And for once, perhaps, it is a pity.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis sharp, birdlike eyes darted here and there.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d he remarked suddenly, with an intonation of relief. \u201cThe\r\nhearth-rug is crooked,\u201d and he bent down to straighten it.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he uttered an exclamation and rose. In his hand he held a\r\nsmall fragment of paper.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn France, as in England,\u201d he remarked, \u201cthe domestics omit to sweep\r\nunder the mats!\u201d\r\n\r\nBex took the fragment from him, and I came closer to examine it.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou recognize it\u2014eh, Hastings?\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head, puzzled\u2014and yet that particular shade of pink paper\r\nwas very familiar.\r\n\r\nThe commissary\u2019s mental processes were quicker than mine.\r\n\r\n\u201cA fragment of a cheque,\u201d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe piece of paper was roughly about two inches square. On it was\r\nwritten in ink the word \u201cDuveen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Bien___,\u201d said Bex. \u201cThis cheque was payable to, or drawn by, one\r\nnamed Duveen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe former, I fancy,\u201d said Poirot, \u201cfor, if I am not mistaken, the\r\nhandwriting is that of M. Renauld.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat was soon established, by comparing it with a memorandum from the\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me,\u201d murmured the commissary, with a crestfallen air, \u201cI really\r\ncannot imagine how I came to overlook this.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe moral of that is, always look under the mats! My friend Hastings\r\nhere will tell you that anything in the least crooked is a torment to\r\nme. As soon as I saw that the hearth-rug was out of the straight, I\r\nsaid to myself: \u2018_Tiens!___ The leg of the chair caught it in being\r\npushed back. Possibly there may be something beneath it which the good\r\nFran\u00e7oise overlooked.\u2019\u200a\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFran\u00e7oise?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOr Denise, or L\u00e9onie. Whoever did this room. Since there is no dust,\r\nthe room _must___ have been done this morning. I reconstruct the\r\nincident like this. Yesterday, possibly last night, M. Renauld drew a\r\ncheque to the order of some one named Duveen. Afterwards it was torn\r\nup, and scattered on the floor. This morning\u2014\u201d But M. Bex was already\r\npulling impatiently at the bell.\r\n\r\nFran\u00e7oise answered it. Yes, there had been a lot of pieces of paper on\r\nthe floor. What had she done with them? Put them in the kitchen stove\r\nof course! What else?\r\n\r\nWith a gesture of despair, Bex dismissed her. Then, his face\r\nlightening, he ran to the desk. In a minute he was hunting through the\r\ndead man\u2019s cheque book. Then he repeated his former gesture. The last\r\ncounterfoil was blank.\r\n\r\n\u201cCourage!\u201d cried Poirot, clapping him on the back. \u201cWithout doubt,\r\nMadame Renauld will be able to tell us all about this mysterious person\r\nnamed Duveen.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe commissary\u2019s face cleared. \u201cThat is true. Let us proceed.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs we turned to leave the room, Poirot remarked casually: \u201cIt was here\r\nthat M. Renauld received his guest last night, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was\u2014but how did you know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy _this___. I found it on the back of the leather chair.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd he held up between his finger and thumb a long black hair\u2014a woman\u2019s\r\nhair!\r\n\r\nM. Bex took us out by the back of the house to where there was a small\r\nshed leaning against the house. He produced a key from his pocket and\r\nunlocked it.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe body is here. We moved it from the scene of the crime just before\r\nyou arrived, as the photographers had done with it.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe opened the door and we passed in. The murdered man lay on the\r\nground, with a sheet over him. M. Bex dexterously whipped off the\r\ncovering. Renauld was a man of medium height, slender and lithe in\r\nfigure. He looked about fifty years of age, and his dark hair was\r\nplentifully streaked with grey. He was clean shaven with a long thin\r\nnose, and eyes set rather close together, and his skin was deeply\r\nbronzed, as that of a man who had spent most of his life beneath\r\ntropical skies. His lips were drawn back from his teeth and an\r\nexpression of absolute amazement and terror was stamped on the livid\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne can see by his face that he was stabbed in the back,\u201d remarked\r\nPoirot.\r\n\r\nVery gently, he turned the dead man over. There, between the\r\nshoulder-blades, staining the light fawn overcoat, was a round dark\r\npatch. In the middle of it there was a slit in the cloth. Poirot\r\nexamined it narrowly.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you any idea with what weapon the crime was committed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was left in the wound.\u201d The commissary reached down a large glass\r\njar. In it was a small object that looked to me more like a paper-knife\r\nthan anything else. It had a black handle, and a narrow shining blade.\r\nThe whole thing was not more than ten inches long. Poirot tested the\r\ndiscoloured point gingerly with his finger tip.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Ma foi!___ but it is sharp! A nice easy little tool for murder!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, we could find no trace of fingerprints on it,\u201d remarked\r\nBex regretfully. \u201cThe murderer must have worn gloves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course he did,\u201d said Poirot contemptuously. \u201cEven in Santiago they\r\nknow enough for that. The veriest amateur of an English Mees knows\r\nit\u2014thanks to the publicity the Bertillon system has been given in the\r\nPress. All the same, it interests me very much that there were no\r\nfinger-prints. It is so amazingly simple to leave the finger-prints of\r\nsome one else! And then the police are happy.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\r\nvery much fear our criminal is not a man of method\u2014either that or he\r\nwas pressed for time. But we shall see.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe let the body fall back into its original position.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe wore only underclothes under his overcoat, I see,\u201d he remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, the examining magistrate thinks that is rather a curious point.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this minute there was a tap on the door which Bex had closed after\r\nhim. He strode forward and opened it. Fran\u00e7oise was there. She\r\nendeavoured to peep in with ghoulish curiosity.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what is it?\u201d demanded Bex impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame. She sends a message that she is much recovered, and is quite\r\nready to receive the examining magistrate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d said M. Bex briskly. \u201cTell M. Hautet and say that we will come\r\nat once.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot lingered a moment, looking back towards the body. I thought for\r\na moment that he was going to apostrophize it, to declare aloud his\r\ndetermination never to rest till he had discovered the murderer. But\r\nwhen he spoke, it was tamely and awkwardly, and his comment was\r\nludicrously inappropriate to the solemnity of the moment.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe wore his overcoat very long,\u201d he said constrainedly.\r\n\nWe found M. Hautet awaiting us in the hall, and we all proceeded\r\nupstairs together, Fran\u00e7oise marching ahead to show us the way. Poirot\r\nwent up in a zigzag fashion which puzzled me, until he whispered with a\r\ngrimace:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo wonder the servants heard M. Renauld mounting the stairs; not a\r\nboard of them but creaks fit to wake the dead!\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the head of the staircase, a small passage branched off.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe servants\u2019 quarters,\u201d explained Bex.\r\n\r\nWe continued along a corridor, and Fran\u00e7oise tapped on the last door to\r\nthe right of it.\r\n\r\nA faint voice bade us enter, and we passed into a large sunny apartment\r\nlooking out towards the sea, which showed blue and sparkling about a\r\nquarter of a mile distant.\r\n\r\nOn a couch, propped up with cushions, and attended by Dr. Durand, lay a\r\ntall, striking-looking woman. She was middle-aged, and her once dark\r\nhair was now almost entirely silvered, but the intense vitality and\r\nstrength of her personality would have made itself felt anywhere. You\r\nknew at once that you were in the presence of what the French call\r\n\u201c_une maitresse femme___.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe greeted us with a dignified inclination of the head.\r\n\r\n\u201cPray be seated, monsieurs.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe took chairs, and the magistrate\u2019s clerk established himself at a\r\nround table.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope, madame,\u201d began M. Hautet, \u201cthat it will not distress you\r\nunduly to relate to us what occurred last night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all, monsieur. I know the value of time, if these scoundrelly\r\nassassins are to be caught and punished.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, madame. It will fatigue you less, I think, if I ask you\r\nquestions and you confine yourself to answering them. At what time did\r\nyou go to bed last night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt half-past nine, monsieur. I was tired.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your husband?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout an hour later, I fancy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid he seem disturbed\u2014upset in any way?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, not more than usual.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat happened then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe slept. I was awakened by a hand being pressed over my mouth. I\r\ntried to scream out, but the hand prevented me. There were two men in\r\nthe room. They were both masked.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you describe them at all, madame?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne was very tall, and had a long black beard, the other was short and\r\nstout. His beard was reddish. They both wore hats pulled down over\r\ntheir eyes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cH\u2019m,\u201d said the magistrate thoughtfully, \u201ctoo much beard, I fear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean they were false?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, madame. But continue your story.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was the short man who was holding me. He forced a gag into my\r\nmouth, and then bound me with rope hand and foot. The other man was\r\nstanding over my husband. He had caught up my little dagger paper-knife\r\nfrom the dressing-table and was holding it with the point just over his\r\nheart. When the short man had finished with me, he joined the other,\r\nand they forced my husband to get up and accompany them into the\r\ndressing-room next door. I was nearly fainting with terror,\r\nnevertheless I listened desperately.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey were speaking in too low a tone for me to hear what they said.\r\nBut I recognized the language, a bastard Spanish such as is spoken in\r\nsome parts of South America. They seemed to be demanding something from\r\nmy husband, and presently they grew angry, and their voices rose a\r\nlittle. I think the tall man was speaking. \u2018You know what we want!\u2019 he\r\nsaid. \u2018_The secret!___ Where is it?\u2019 I do not know what my husband\r\nanswered, but the other replied fiercely: \u2018You lie! We know you have\r\nit. Where are your keys?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I heard sounds of drawers being pulled out. There is a safe on\r\nthe wall of my husband\u2019s dressing-room in which he always keeps a\r\nfairly large amount of ready money. L\u00e9onie tells me this has been\r\nrifled and the money taken, but evidently what they were looking for\r\nwas not there, for presently I heard the tall man, with an oath,\r\ncommand my husband to dress himself. Soon after that, I think some\r\nnoise in the house must have disturbed them, for they hustled my\r\nhusband out into my room only half dressed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Pardon___,\u201d interrupted Poirot, \u201cbut is there then no other egress\r\nfrom the dressing-room?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, monsieur, there is only the communicating door into my room. They\r\nhurried my husband through, the short man in front, and the tall man\r\nbehind him with the dagger still in his hand. Paul tried to break away\r\nto come to me. I saw his agonized eyes. He turned to his captors. \u2018I\r\nmust speak to her,\u2019 he said. Then, coming to the side of the bed, \u2018It\r\nis all right, Eloise,\u2019 he said. \u2018Do not be afraid. I shall return\r\nbefore morning.\u2019 But, although he tried to make his voice confident, I\r\ncould see the terror in his eyes. Then they hustled him out of the\r\ndoor, the tall man saying: \u2018One sound\u2014and you are a dead man,\r\nremember.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter that,\u201d continued Mrs. Renauld, \u201cI must have fainted. The next\r\nthing I recollect is L\u00e9onie rubbing my wrists, and giving me brandy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame Renauld,\u201d said the magistrate, \u201chad you any idea what it was\r\nfor which the assassins were searching?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone whatever, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHad you any knowledge that your husband feared something?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I had seen the change in him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long ago was that?\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Renauld reflected.\r\n\r\n\u201cTen days perhaps.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot longer?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPossibly. I only noticed it then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you question your husband at all as to the cause?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnce. He put me off evasively. Nevertheless, I was convinced that he\r\nwas suffering some terrible anxiety. However, since he evidently wished\r\nto conceal the fact from me, I tried to pretend that I had noticed\r\nnothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWere you aware that he had called in the services of a detective?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA detective?\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Renauld, very much surprised.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, this gentleman\u2014M. Hercule Poirot.\u201d Poirot bowed. \u201cHe arrived\r\ntoday in response to a summons from your husband.\u201d And taking the\r\nletter written by M. Renauld from his pocket he handed it to the lady.\r\n\r\nShe read it with apparently genuine astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had no idea of this. Evidently he was fully cognizant of the\r\ndanger.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, madame, I will beg of you to be frank with me. Is there any\r\nincident in your husband\u2019s past life in South America which might throw\r\nlight on his murder?\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Renauld reflected deeply, but at last shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can think of none. Certainly my husband had many enemies, people he\r\nhad got the better of in some way or another, but I can think of no one\r\ndistinctive case. I do not say there is no such incident\u2014only that I am\r\nnot aware of it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe examining magistrate stroked his beard disconsolately.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you can fix the time of this outrage?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I distinctly remember hearing the clock on the mantelpiece strike\r\ntwo.\u201d She nodded towards an eight-day travelling clock in a leather\r\ncase which stood in the centre of the chimney-piece.\r\n\r\nPoirot rose from his seat, scrutinized the clock carefully, and nodded,\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd here too,\u201d exclaimed M. Bex, \u201cis a wrist watch, knocked off the\r\ndressing-table by the assassins, without doubt, and smashed to atoms.\r\nLittle did they know it would testify against them.\u201d\r\n\r\nGently he picked away the fragments of broken glass. Suddenly his face\r\nchanged to one of utter stupefaction.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon Dieu!___\u201d he ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe hands of the watch point to seven o\u2019clock!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d cried the examining magistrate, astonished.\r\n\r\nBut Poirot, deft as ever, took the broken trinket from the startled\r\ncommissary, and held it to his ear. Then he smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe glass is broken, yes, but the watch itself is still going.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the mystery was greeted with a relieved smile. But\r\nthe magistrate bethought him of another point.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut surely it is not seven o\u2019clock now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Poirot gently, \u201cit is a few minutes after five. Possibly the\r\nwatch gains, is that so, madame?\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Renauld was frowning perplexedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt does gain,\u201d she admitted, \u201cbut I\u2019ve never known it to gain quite so\r\nmuch as that.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a gesture of impatience, the magistrate left the matter of the\r\nwatch and proceeded with his interrogatory.\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame, the front door was found ajar. It seems almost certain that\r\nthe murderers entered that way, yet it has not been forced at all. Can\r\nyou suggest any explanation?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPossibly my husband went out for a stroll the last thing, and forgot\r\nto latch it when he came in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that a likely thing to happen?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery. My husband was the most absent-minded of men.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a slight frown on her brow as she spoke, as though this trait\r\nin the dead man\u2019s character had at times vexed her.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is one inference I think we might draw,\u201d remarked the commissary\r\nsuddenly. \u201cSince the men insisted on M. Renauld dressing himself, it\r\nlooks as though the place they were taking him to, the place where \u2018the\r\nsecret\u2019 was concealed, lay some distance away.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe magistrate nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, far, and yet not too far, since he spoke of being back by\r\nmorning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat times does the last train leave the station of Merlinville?\u201d\r\nasked Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cEleven-fifty one way, and 12:17 the other, but it is more probable\r\nthat they had a motor waiting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Poirot, looking somewhat crestfallen.\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed, that might be one way of tracing them,\u201d continued the\r\nmagistrate, brightening. \u201cA motor containing two foreigners is quite\r\nlikely to have been noticed. That is an excellent point, M. Bex.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe smiled to himself, and then, becoming grave once more, he said to\r\nMrs. Renauld:\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is another question. Do you know any one of the name of\r\n\u2018Duveen\u2019?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDuveen?\u201d Mrs. Renauld repeated, thoughtfully. \u201cNo, for the moment, I\r\ncannot say I do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have never heard your husband mention any one of that name?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know any one whose Christian name is Bella?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe watched Mrs. Renauld narrowly as he spoke, seeking to surprise any\r\nsigns of anger or consciousness, but she merely shook her head in quite\r\na natural manner. He continued his questions.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you aware that your husband had a visitor last night?\u201d\r\n\r\nNow he saw the red mount slightly in her cheeks, but she replied\r\ncomposedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, who was that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA lady.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed?\u201d\r\n\r\nBut for the moment the magistrate was content to say no more. It seemed\r\nunlikely that Madame Daubreuil had any connection with the crime, and\r\nhe was anxious not to upset Mrs. Renauld more than necessary.\r\n\r\nHe made a sign to the commissary, and the latter replied with a nod.\r\nThen rising, he went across the room, and returned with the glass jar\r\nwe had seen in the outhouse in his hand. From this, he took the dagger.\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame,\u201d he said gently, \u201cdo you recognize this?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe gave a little cry.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that is my little dagger.\u201d Then\u2014she saw the stained point, and\r\nshe drew back, her eyes widening with horror. \u201cIs that\u2014blood?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, madame. Your husband was killed with this weapon.\u201d He removed it\r\nhastily from sight. \u201cYou are quite sure about it\u2019s being the one that\r\nwas on your dressing-table last night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes. It was a present from my son. He was in the Air Force during\r\nthe War. He gave his age as older than it was.\u201d There was a touch of\r\nthe proud mother in her voice. \u201cThis was made from a streamline\r\naeroplane wire, and was given to me by my son as a souvenir of the\r\nWar.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see, madame. That brings us to another matter. Your son, where is he\r\nnow? It is necessary that he should be telegraphed to without delay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJack? He is on his way to Buenos Ayres.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. My husband telegraphed to him yesterday. He had sent him on\r\nbusiness to Paris, but yesterday he discovered that it would be\r\nnecessary for him to proceed without delay to South America. There was\r\na boat leaving Cherbourg for Buenos Ayres last night, and he wired him\r\nto catch it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you any knowledge of what the business in Buenos Ayres was?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, monsieur, I know nothing of its nature, but Buenos Ayres is not my\r\nson\u2019s final destination. He was going overland from there to Santiago.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd, in unison, the magistrate and the commissary exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\u201cSantiago! Again Santiago!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment, when we were all stunned by the mention of that\r\nword, that Poirot approached Mrs. Renauld. He had been standing by the\r\nwindow like a man lost in a dream, and I doubt if he had fully taken in\r\nwhat had passed. He paused by the lady\u2019s side with a bow.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Pardon___, madame, but may I examine your wrists.\u201d\r\n\r\nThough slightly surprised at the request, Mrs. Renauld held them out to\r\nhim. Round each of them was a cruel red mark where the cords had bitten\r\ninto the flesh. As he examined them, I fancied that a momentary flicker\r\nof excitement I had seen in his eyes disappeared.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey must cause you great pain,\u201d he said, and once more he looked\r\npuzzled.\r\n\r\nBut the magistrate was speaking excitedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYoung M. Renauld must be communicated with at once by wireless. It is\r\nvital that we should know anything he can tell us about this trip to\r\nSantiago.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI hoped he might have been near at hand, so\r\nthat we could have saved you pain, madame.\u201d He paused.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean,\u201d she said in a low voice, \u201cthe identification of my\r\nhusband\u2019s body?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe magistrate bowed his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am a strong woman, monsieur. I can bear all that is required of me.\r\nI am ready\u2014now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, tomorrow will be quite soon enough, I assure you\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI prefer to get it over,\u201d she said in a low tone, a spasm of pain\r\ncrossing her face. \u201cIf you will be so good as to give me your arm,\r\nDoctor?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctor hastened forward, a cloak was thrown over Mrs. Renauld\u2019s\r\nshoulders, and a slow procession went down the stairs. M. Bex hurried\r\non ahead to open the door of the shed. In a minute or two Mrs. Renauld\r\nappeared in the doorway. She was very pale, but resolute. Behind her,\r\nM. Hautet was clacking commiserations and apologies like an animated\r\nhen.\r\n\r\nShe raised her hand to her face.\r\n\r\n\u201cA moment, messieurs, while I steel myself.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe took her hand away and looked down at the dead man. Then the\r\nmarvellous self-control which had upheld her so far deserted her.\r\n\r\n\u201cPaul!\u201d she cried. \u201cHusband! Oh, God!\u201d And pitching forward she fell\r\nunconscious to the ground.\r\n\r\nInstantly Poirot was beside her, he raised the lid of her eye, felt her\r\npulse. When he had satisfied himself that she had really fainted, he\r\ndrew aside. He caught me by the arm.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am an imbecile, my friend! If ever there was love and grief in a\r\nwoman\u2019s voice, I heard it then. My little idea was all wrong. _Eh\r\nbien!___ I must start again!\u201d\r\n\nBetween them, the doctor and M. Hautet carried the unconscious woman\r\ninto the house. The commissary looked after them, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Pauvre femme___,\u201d he murmured to himself. \u201cThe shock was too much for\r\nher. Well, well, we can do nothing. Now, M. Poirot, shall we visit the\r\nplace where the crime was committed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you please, M. Bex.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe passed through the house, and out by the front door. Poirot had\r\nlooked up at the staircase in passing, and shook his head in a\r\ndissatisfied manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is to me incredible that the servants heard nothing. The creaking\r\nof that staircase, with _three___ people descending it, would awaken\r\nthe dead!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was the middle of the night, remember. They were sound asleep by\r\nthen.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Poirot continued to shake his head as though not fully accepting\r\nthe explanation. On the sweep of the drive, he paused, looking up at\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat moved them in the first place to try if the front door were open?\r\nIt was a most unlikely thing that it should be. It was far more\r\nprobable that they should at once try to force a window.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut all the windows on the ground floor are barred with iron\r\nshutters,\u201d objected the commissary.\r\n\r\nPoirot pointed to a window on the first floor.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is the window of the bedroom we have just come from, is it not?\r\nAnd see\u2014there is a tree by which it would be the easiest thing in the\r\nworld to mount.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPossibly,\u201d admitted the other. \u201cBut they could not have done so\r\nwithout leaving footprints in the flower-bed.\u201d\r\n\r\nI saw the justice of his words. There were two large oval flower-beds\r\nplanted with scarlet geraniums, one each side of the steps leading up\r\nto the front door. The tree in question had its roots actually at the\r\nback of the bed itself, and it would have been impossible to reach it\r\nwithout stepping on the bed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d continued the commissary, \u201cowing to the dry weather no\r\nprints would show on the drive or paths; but, on the soft mould of the\r\nflower-bed, it would have been a very different affair.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot went close to the bed and studied it attentively. As Bex had\r\nsaid, the mould was perfectly smooth. There was not an indentation on\r\nit anywhere.\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded, as though convinced, and we turned away, but he suddenly\r\ndarted off and began examining the other flower-bed.\r\n\r\n\u201cM. Bex!\u201d he called. \u201cSee here. Here are plenty of traces for you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe commissary joined him\u2014and smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear M. Poirot, those are without doubt the footprints of the\r\ngardener\u2019s large hobnailed boots. In any case, it would have no\r\nimportance, since this side we have no tree, and consequently no means\r\nof gaining access to the upper story.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue,\u201d said Poirot, evidently crestfallen. \u201cSo you think these\r\nfootprints are of no importance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot the least in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen, to my utter astonishment, Poirot pronounced these words:\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not agree with you. I have a little idea that these footprints\r\nare the most important things we have seen yet.\u201d\r\n\r\nM. Bex said nothing, merely shrugged his shoulders. He was far too\r\ncourteous to utter his real opinion.\r\n\r\n\u201cShall we proceed?\u201d he asked instead.\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. I can investigate this matter of the footprints later,\u201d\r\nsaid Poirot cheerfully.\r\n\r\nInstead of following the drive down to the gate, M. Bex turned up a\r\npath that branched off at right angles. It led, up a slight incline,\r\nround to the right of the house, and was bordered on either side by a\r\nkind of shrubbery. Suddenly it emerged into a little clearing from\r\nwhich one obtained a view of the sea. A seat had been placed here, and\r\nnot far from it was a rather ramshackle shed. A few steps further on, a\r\nneat line of small bushes marked the boundary of the Villa grounds. M.\r\nBex pushed his way through these and we found ourselves on a wide\r\nstretch of open downs. I looked round, and saw something that filled me\r\nwith astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, this is a golf course,\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\nBex nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe limits are not completed yet,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt is hoped to be\r\nable to open them sometime next month. It was some of the men working\r\non them who discovered the body early this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\nI gave a gasp. A little to my left, where for the moment I had\r\noverlooked it, was a long narrow pit, and by it, face downwards, was\r\nthe body of a man! For a moment, my heart gave a terrible leap, and I\r\nhad a wild fancy that the tragedy had been duplicated. But the\r\ncommissary dispelled my illusion by moving forward with a sharp\r\nexclamation of annoyance:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have my police been about? They had strict orders to allow no one\r\nnear the place without proper credentials!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man on the ground turned his head over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I have proper credentials,\u201d he remarked, and rose slowly to his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear M. Giraud,\u201d cried the commissary. \u201cI had no idea that you had\r\narrived, even. The examining magistrate has been awaiting you with the\r\nutmost impatience.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, I was scanning the new-comer with the keenest curiosity.\r\nThe famous detective from the Paris S\u00fbret\u00e9 was familiar to me by name,\r\nand I was extremely interested to see him in the flesh. He was very\r\ntall, perhaps about thirty years of age, with auburn hair and\r\nmoustache, and a military carriage. There was a trace of arrogance in\r\nhis manner which showed that he was fully alive to his own importance.\r\nBex introduced us, presenting Poirot as a colleague. A flicker of\r\ninterest came into the detective\u2019s eye.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know you by name, M. Poirot,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cut quite a figure in\r\nthe old days, didn\u2019t you? But methods are very different now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCrimes, though, are very much the same,\u201d remarked Poirot gently.\r\n\r\nI saw at once that Giraud was prepared to be hostile. He resented the\r\nother being associated with him, and I felt that if he came across any\r\nclue of importance he would be more than likely to keep it to himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe examining magistrate\u2014\u201d began Bex again. But Giraud interrupted him\r\nrudely:\r\n\r\n\u201cA fig for the examining magistrate! The light is the important thing.\r\nFor all practical purposes it will be gone in another half-hour or so.\r\nI know all about the case, and the people at the house will do very\r\nwell until tomorrow, but, if we\u2019re going to find a clue to the\r\nmurderers, here is the spot we shall find it. Is it your police who\r\nhave been trampling all over the place? I thought they knew better\r\nnowadays.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAssuredly they do. The marks you complain of were made by the workmen\r\nwho discovered the body.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe other grunted disgustedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can see the tracks where the three of them came through the\r\nhedge\u2014but they were cunning. You can just recognize the centre\r\nfootmarks as those of M. Renauld, but those on either side have been\r\ncarefully obliterated. Not that there would really be much to see\r\nanyway on this hard ground, but they weren\u2019t taking any chances.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe external sign,\u201d said Poirot. \u201cThat is what you seek, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe other detective stared.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\r\n\r\nA very faint smile came to Poirot\u2019s lips. He seemed about to speak, but\r\nchecked himself. He bent down to where a spade was lying.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the grave was dug with, right enough,\u201d said Giraud. \u201cBut\r\nyou\u2019ll get nothing from it. It was Renauld\u2019s own spade, and the man who\r\nused it wore gloves. Here they are.\u201d He gesticulated with his foot to\r\nwhere two soiled earth-stained gloves were lying. \u201cAnd they\u2019re\r\nRenauld\u2019s too\u2014or at least his gardener\u2019s. I tell you, the men who\r\nplanned out this crime were taking no chances. The man was stabbed with\r\nhis own dagger, and would have been buried with his own spade. They\r\ncounted on leaving no traces! But I\u2019ll beat them. There\u2019s always\r\n_something!___ And I mean to find it.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Poirot was now apparently interested in something else, a short\r\ndiscoloured piece of lead-piping which lay beside the spade. He touched\r\nit delicately with his finger.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd does this, too, belong to the murdered man?\u201d he asked, and I\r\nthought I detected a subtle flavour of irony in the question.\r\n\r\nGiraud shrugged his shoulders to indicate that he neither knew nor\r\ncared.\r\n\r\n\u201cMay have been lying around here for weeks. Anyway, it doesn\u2019t interest\r\nme.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI, on the contrary, find it very interesting,\u201d said Poirot sweetly.\r\n\r\nI guessed that he was merely bent on annoying the Paris detective and,\r\nif so, he succeeded. The other turned away rudely, remarking that he\r\nhad no time to waste, and bending down he resumed his minute search of\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Poirot, as though struck by a sudden idea, stepped back over\r\nthe boundary, and tried the door of the little shed.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s locked,\u201d said Giraud over his shoulder. \u201cBut it\u2019s only a place\r\nwhere the gardener keeps his rubbish. The spade didn\u2019t come from there,\r\nbut from the toolshed up by the house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMarvellous,\u201d murmured M. Bex, to me ecstatically. \u201cHe has been here\r\nbut half an hour, and he already knows everything! What a man!\r\nUndoubtedly Giraud is the greatest detective alive today.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough I disliked the detective heartily, I nevertheless was secretly\r\nimpressed. Efficiency seemed to radiate from the man. I could not help\r\nfeeling that, so far, Poirot had not greatly distinguished himself, and\r\nit vexed me. He seemed to be directing his attention to all sorts of\r\nsilly, puerile points that had nothing to do with the case. Indeed, at\r\nthis juncture, he suddenly asked:\r\n\r\n\u201cM. Bex, tell me, I pray you, the meaning of this whitewashed line that\r\nextends all round the grave. Is it a device of the police?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, M. Poirot, it is an affair of the golf course. It shows that there\r\nis here to be a \u2018bunkair,\u2019 as you call it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA bunkair?\u201d Poirot turned to me. \u201cThat is the irregular hole filled\r\nwith sand and a bank at one side, is it not?\u201d\r\n\r\nI concurred.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do not play the golf, M. Poirot?\u201d inquired Bex.\r\n\r\n\u201cI? Never! What a game!\u201d He became excited. \u201cFigure to yourself, each\r\nhole it is of a different length. The obstacles, they are not arranged\r\nmathematically. Even the greens are frequently up one side! There is\r\nonly one pleasing thing\u2014the how do you call them?\u2014tee boxes! They, at\r\nleast, are symmetrical.\u201d\r\n\r\nI could not refrain from a laugh at the way the game appeared to\r\nPoirot, and my little friend smiled at me affectionately, bearing no\r\nmalice. Then he asked:\r\n\r\n\u201cBut M. Renauld, without doubt he played the golf?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, he was a keen golfer. It\u2019s mainly owing to him, and to his large\r\nsubscriptions, that this work is being carried forward. He even had a\r\nsay in the designing of it.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nThen he remarked:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was not a very good choice they made\u2014of a spot to bury the body?\r\nWhen the men began to dig up the ground, all would have been\r\ndiscovered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d cried Giraud triumphantly. \u201cAnd that _proves___ that they\r\nwere strangers to the place. It\u2019s an excellent piece of indirect\r\nevidence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Poirot doubtfully. \u201cNo one who knew would bury a body\r\nthere\u2014unless\u2014unless\u2014they _wanted___ it to be discovered. And that is\r\nclearly absurd, is it not?\u201d\r\n\r\nGiraud did not even trouble to reply.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Poirot, in a somewhat dissatisfied voice.\r\n\u201cYes\u2014undoubtedly\u2014absurd!\u201d\r\n\nAs we retraced our steps to the house, M. Bex excused himself for\r\nleaving us, explaining that he must immediately acquaint the examining\r\nmagistrate with the fact of Giraud\u2019s arrival. Giraud himself had been\r\nobviously delighted when Poirot declared that he had seen all he\r\nwanted. The last thing we observed, as we left the spot, was Giraud,\r\ncrawling about on all fours, with a thoroughness in his search that I\r\ncould not but admire. Poirot guessed my thoughts, for as soon as we\r\nwere alone he remarked ironically:\r\n\r\n\u201cAt last you have seen the detective you admire\u2014the human foxhound! Is\r\nit not so, my friend?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt any rate, he\u2019s _doing___ something,\u201d I said, with asperity. \u201cIf\r\nthere\u2019s anything to find, he\u2019ll find it. Now you\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien!___ I also have found something! A piece of lead-piping.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNonsense, Poirot. You know very well that\u2019s got nothing to do with it.\r\nI meant _little___ things\u2014traces that may lead us infallibly to the\r\nmurderers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon ami___, a clue of two feet long is every bit as valuable as one\r\nmeasuring two millimetres! But it is the romantic idea that all\r\nimportant clues must be infinitesimal! As to the piece of lead-piping\r\nhaving nothing to do with the crime, you say that because Giraud told\r\nyou so. No\u201d\u2014as I was about to interpose a question\u2014\u201cwe will say no\r\nmore. Leave Giraud to his search, and me to my ideas. The case seems\r\nstraightforward enough\u2014and yet\u2014and yet, _mon ami___, I am not\r\nsatisfied! And do you know why? Because of the wrist watch that is two\r\nhours fast. And then there are several curious little points that do\r\nnot seem to fit in. For instance, if the object of the murderers was\r\nrevenge, why did they not stab Renauld in his sleep and have done with\r\nit?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey wanted the \u2018secret,\u2019\u200a\u201d I reminded him.\r\n\r\nPoirot brushed a speck of dust from his sleeve with a dissatisfied air.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, where is this \u2018secret\u2019? Presumably some distance away, since\r\nthey wish him to dress himself. Yet he is found murdered close at hand,\r\nalmost within ear-shot of the house. Then again, it is pure chance that\r\na weapon such as the dagger should be lying about casually, ready to\r\nhand.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe paused frowning, and then went on:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did the servants hear nothing? Were they drugged? Was there an\r\naccomplice and did that accomplice see to it that the front door should\r\nremain open? I wonder if\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly. We had reached the drive in front of the house.\r\nSuddenly he turned to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy friend, I am about to surprise you\u2014to please you! I have taken your\r\nreproaches to heart! We will examine some footprints!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn that right-hand bed yonder. M. Bex says that they are the footmarks\r\nof the gardener. Let us see if that is so. See, he approaches with his\r\nwheelbarrow.\u201d\r\n\r\nIndeed an elderly man was just crossing the drive with a barrowful of\r\nseedlings. Poirot called to him, and he set down the barrow and came\r\nhobbling towards us.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are going to ask him for one of his boots to compare with the\r\nfootmarks?\u201d I asked breathlessly. My faith in Poirot revived a little.\r\nSince he said the footprints in this right-hand bed were important,\r\npresumably they _were___.\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut won\u2019t he think it very odd?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe will not think about it at all.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe could say no more, for the old man had joined us.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou want me for something, monsieur?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. You have been gardener here a long time, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTwenty-four years, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your name is\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAuguste, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was admiring these magnificent geraniums. They are truly superb.\r\nThey have been planted long?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome time, monsieur. But of course, to keep the beds looking smart,\r\none must keep bedding out a few new plants, and remove those that are\r\nover, besides keeping the old blooms well picked off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou put in some new plants yesterday, didn\u2019t you? Those in the middle\r\nthere, and in the other bed also?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur has a sharp eye. It takes always a day or so for them to\r\n\u2018pick up.\u2019 Yes, I put ten new plants in each bed last night. As\r\nMonsieur doubtless knows, one should not put in plants when the sun is\r\nhot.\u201d\r\n\r\nAuguste was charmed with Poirot\u2019s interest, and was quite inclined to\r\nbe garrulous.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a splendid specimen there,\u201d said Poirot, pointing. \u201cMight I\r\nperhaps have a cutting of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut certainly, monsieur.\u201d The old fellow stepped into the bed, and\r\ncarefully took a slip from the plant Poirot had admired.\r\n\r\nPoirot was profuse in his thanks, and Auguste departed to his barrow.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see?\u201d said Poirot with a smile, as he bent over the bed to examine\r\nthe indentation of the gardener\u2019s hobnailed boot. \u201cIt is quite simple.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did not realize\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat the foot would be inside the boot? You do not use your excellent\r\nmental capacities sufficiently. Well, what of the footmark?\u201d\r\n\r\nI examined the bed carefully.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll the footmarks in the bed were made by the same boot,\u201d I said at\r\nlength after a careful study.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think so? _Eh bien___, I agree with you,\u201d said Poirot.\r\n\r\nHe seemed quite uninterested, and as though he were thinking of\r\nsomething else.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt any rate,\u201d I remarked, \u201cyou will have one bee less in your bonnet\r\nnow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon Dieu!___ But what an idiom! What does it mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I meant was that now you will give up your interest in these\r\nfootmarks.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut to my surprise Poirot shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, _mon ami___. At last I am on the right track. I am still in\r\nthe dark, but, as I hinted just now to M. Bex, these footmarks are the\r\nmost important and interesting things in the case! That poor Giraud\u2014I\r\nshould not be surprised if he took no notice of them whatever.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt that moment, the front door opened, and M. Hautet and the commissary\r\ncame down the steps.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, M. Poirot, we were coming to look for you,\u201d said the magistrate.\r\n\u201cIt is getting late, but I wish to pay a visit to Madame Daubreuil.\r\nWithout doubt she will be very much upset by M. Renauld\u2019s death, and we\r\nmay be fortunate enough to get a clue from her. The secret that he did\r\nnot confide to his wife, it is possible that he may have told it to the\r\nwoman whose love held him enslaved. We know where our Samsons are weak,\r\ndon\u2019t we?\u201d\r\n\r\nI admired the picturesqueness of M. Hautet\u2019s language. I suspected that\r\nthe examining magistrate was by now thoroughly enjoying his part in the\r\nmysterious drama.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs M. Giraud not going to accompany us?\u201d asked Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cM. Giraud has shown clearly that he prefers to conduct the case in his\r\nown way,\u201d said M. Hautet dryly. One could see easily enough that\r\nGiraud\u2019s cavalier treatment of the examining magistrate had not\r\nprejudiced the latter in his favour. We said no more, but fell into\r\nline. Poirot walked with the examining magistrate, and the commissary\r\nand I followed a few paces behind.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no doubt that Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s story is substantially correct,\u201d he\r\nremarked to me in a confidential tone. \u201cI have been telephoning\r\nheadquarters. It seems that three times in the last six weeks\u2014that is\r\nto say since the arrival of M. Renauld at Merlinville\u2014Madame Daubreuil\r\nhas paid a large sum in notes into her banking account. Altogether the\r\nsum totals two hundred thousand francs!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me,\u201d I said, considering, \u201cthat must be something like four\r\nthousand pounds!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely. Yes, there can be no doubt that he was absolutely\r\ninfatuated. But it remains to be seen whether he confided his secret to\r\nher. The examining magistrate is hopeful, but I hardly share his\r\nviews.\u201d\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation we were walking down the lane towards the fork\r\nin the road where our car had halted earlier in the afternoon, and in\r\nanother moment I realized that the Villa Marguerite, the home of the\r\nmysterious Madame Daubreuil, was the small house from which the\r\nbeautiful girl had emerged.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe has lived here for many years,\u201d said the commissary, nodding his\r\nhead towards the house. \u201cVery quietly, very unobtrusively. She seems to\r\nhave no friends or relations other than the acquaintances she has made\r\nin Merlinville. She never refers to the past, nor to her husband. One\r\ndoes not even know if he is alive or dead. There is a mystery about\r\nher, you comprehend.\u201d I nodded, my interest growing.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd\u2014the daughter?\u201d I ventured.\r\n\r\n\u201cA truly beautiful young girl\u2014modest, devout, all that she should be.\r\nOne pities her, for, though she may know nothing of the past, a man who\r\nwants to ask her hand in marriage must necessarily inform himself, and\r\nthen\u2014\u201d The commissary shrugged his shoulders cynically.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it would not be her fault!\u201d I cried, with rising indignation.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. But what will you? A man is particular about his wife\u2019s\r\nantecedents.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was prevented from further argument by our arrival at the door. M.\r\nHautet rang the bell. A few minutes elapsed, and then we heard a\r\nfootfall within, and the door was opened. On the threshold stood my\r\nyoung goddess of that afternoon. When she saw us, the colour left her\r\ncheeks, leaving her deathly white, and her eyes widened with\r\napprehension. There was no doubt about it, she was afraid!\r\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle Daubreuil,\u201d said M. Hautet, sweeping off his hat, \u201cwe\r\nregret infinitely to disturb you, but the exigencies of the Law\u2014you\r\ncomprehend? My compliments to Madame your mother, and will she have the\r\ngoodness to grant me a few moments\u2019 interview.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment the girl stood motionless. Her left hand was pressed to\r\nher side, as though to still the sudden unconquerable agitation of her\r\nheart. But she mastered herself, and said in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cI will go and see. Please come inside.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe entered a room on the left of the hall, and we heard the low murmur\r\nof her voice. And then another voice, much the same in timbre, but with\r\na slightly harder inflection behind its mellow roundness said:\r\n\r\n\u201cBut certainly. Ask them to enter.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn another minute we were face to face with the mysterious Madame\r\nDaubreuil.\r\n\r\nShe was not nearly so tall as her daughter, and the rounded curves of\r\nher figure had all the grace of full maturity. Her hair, again unlike\r\nher daughter\u2019s, was dark, and parted in the middle in the madonna\r\nstyle. Her eyes, half hidden by the drooping lids, were blue. There was\r\na dimple in the round chin, and the half parted lips seemed always to\r\nhover on the verge of a mysterious smile. There was something almost\r\nexaggeratedly feminine about her, at once yielding and seductive.\r\nThough very well preserved, she was certainly no longer young, but her\r\ncharm was of the quality which is independent of age.\r\n\r\nStanding there, in her black dress with the fresh white collar and\r\ncuffs, her hands clasped together, she looked subtly appealing and\r\nhelpless.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou wished to see me, monsieur?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, madame.\u201d M. Hautet cleared his throat. \u201cI am investigating the\r\ndeath of M. Renauld. You have heard of it, no doubt?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head without speaking. Her expression did not change.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe came to ask you whether you can\u2014er\u2014throw any light upon the\r\ncircumstances surrounding it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI?\u201d The surprise of her tone was excellent.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, madame. It would, perhaps, be better if we could speak to you\r\nalone.\u201d He looked meaningly in the direction of the girl.\r\n\r\nMadame Daubreuil turned to her.\r\n\r\n\u201cMarthe, dear\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the girl shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, _maman___, I will not go. I am not a child. I am twenty-two. I\r\nshall not go.\u201d\r\n\r\nMadame Daubreuil turned back to the examining magistrate.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should prefer not to speak before Mademoiselle Daubreuil.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs my daughter says, she is not a child.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment the magistrate hesitated, baffled.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, madame,\u201d he said at last. \u201cHave it your own way. We have\r\nreason to believe that you were in the habit of visiting the dead man\r\nat his Villa in the evenings. Is that so?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe colour rose in the lady\u2019s pale cheeks, but she replied quietly:\r\n\r\n\u201cI deny your right to ask me such a question!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame, we are investigating a murder.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what of it? I had nothing to do with the murder.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame, we do not say that for a moment. But you knew the dead man\r\nwell. Did he ever confide in you as to any danger that threatened him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid he ever mention his life in Santiago, and any enemies he may have\r\nmade there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you can give us no help at all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fear not. I really do not see why you should come to me. Cannot his\r\nwife tell you what you want to know?\u201d Her voice held a slender\r\ninflection of irony.\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame Renauld has told us all she can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Madame Daubreuil. \u201cI wonder\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou wonder what, madame?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe examining magistrate looked at her. He was aware that he was\r\nfighting a duel, and that he had no mean antagonist.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou persist in your statement that M. Renauld confided nothing in\r\nyou?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy should you think it likely that he should confide in me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause, madame,\u201d said M. Hautet, with calculated brutality. \u201cA man\r\ntells to his mistress what he does not always tell to his wife.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d she sprang forward. Her eyes flashed fire. \u201cMonsieur, you insult\r\nme! And before my daughter! I can tell you nothing. Have the goodness\r\nto leave my house!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe honours undoubtedly rested with the lady. We left the Villa\r\nMarguerite like a shamefaced pack of schoolboys. The magistrate\r\nmuttered angry ejaculations to himself. Poirot seemed lost in thought.\r\nSuddenly he came out of his reverie with a start, and inquired of M.\r\nHautet if there was a good hotel near at hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is a small place, the Hotel des Bains, on this side of town. A\r\nfew hundred yards down the road. It will be handy for your\r\ninvestigations. We shall see you in the morning then, I presume?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I thank you, M. Hautet.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith mutual civilities, we parted company, Poirot and I going towards\r\nMerlinville, and the others returning to the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe French police system is very marvellous,\u201d said Poirot, looking\r\nafter them. \u201cThe information they possess about every one\u2019s life, down\r\nto the most commonplace detail, is extraordinary. Though he has only\r\nbeen here a little over six weeks, they are perfectly well acquainted\r\nwith M. Renauld\u2019s tastes and pursuits, and at a moment\u2019s notice they\r\ncan produce information as to Madame Daubreuil\u2019s banking account, and\r\nthe sums that have lately been paid in! Undoubtedly the _dossier___ is\r\na great institution. But what is that?\u201d He turned sharply.\r\n\r\nA figure was running hatless, down the road after us. It was Marthe\r\nDaubreuil.\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d she cried breathlessly, as she reached us. \u201cI\u2014I\r\nshould not do this, I know. You must not tell my mother. But is it\r\ntrue, what the people say, that M. Renauld called in a detective before\r\nhe died, and\u2014and that you are he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, mademoiselle,\u201d said Poirot gently. \u201cIt is quite true. But how did\r\nyou learn it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFran\u00e7oise told our Am\u00e9lie,\u201d explained Marthe, with a blush.\r\n\r\nPoirot made a grimace.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe secrecy, it is impossible in an affair of this kind! Not that it\r\nmatters. Well, mademoiselle, what is it you want to know?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl hesitated. She seemed longing, yet fearing, to speak. At last,\r\nalmost in a whisper, she asked:\r\n\r\n\u201cIs\u2014any one suspected?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot eyed her keenly.\r\n\r\nThen he replied evasively:\r\n\r\n\u201cSuspicion is in the air at present, mademoiselle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I know\u2014but\u2014any one in particular?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl seemed frightened by the question. All at once Poirot\u2019s words\r\nabout her earlier in the day recurred to me. The \u201cgirl with the anxious\r\neyes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cM. Renauld was always very kind to me,\u201d she replied at last. \u201cIt is\r\nnatural that I should be interested.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Poirot. \u201cWell, mademoiselle, suspicion at present is\r\nhovering round two persons.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo?\u201d\r\n\r\nI could have sworn there was a note of surprise and relief in her\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\u201cTheir names are unknown, but they are presumed to be Chilians from\r\nSantiago. And now, mademoiselle, you see what comes of being young and\r\nbeautiful! I have betrayed professional secrets for you!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl laughed merrily, and then, rather shyly, she thanked him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must run back now. _Maman___ will miss me.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd she turned and ran back up the road, looking like a modern\r\nAtalanta. I stared after her.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon ami___,\u201d said Poirot, in his gentle ironical voice, \u201cis it that\r\nwe are to remain planted here all night\u2014just because you have seen a\r\nbeautiful young woman, and your head is in a whirl?\u201d\r\n\r\nI laughed and apologized.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut she _is___ beautiful, Poirot. Any one might be excused for being\r\nbowled over by her.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot groaned.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon Dieu!___ But it is that you have the susceptible heart!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot,\u201d I said, \u201cdo you remember after the Styles Case when\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you were in love with two charming women at once, and neither of\r\nthem were for you? Yes, I remember.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou consoled me by saying that perhaps some day we should hunt\r\ntogether again, and that then\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien?___\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we are hunting together again, and\u2014\u201d I paused, and laughed\r\nrather self-consciously.\r\n\r\nBut to my surprise Poirot shook his head very earnestly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, _mon ami___, do not set your heart on Marthe Daubreuil. She is not\r\nfor you, that one! Take it from Papa Poirot!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy,\u201d I cried, \u201cthe commissary assured me that she was as good as she\r\nis beautiful! A perfect angel!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome of the greatest criminals I have known had the faces of angels,\u201d\r\nremarked Poirot cheerfully. \u201cA malformation of the grey cells may\r\ncoincide quite easily with the face of a madonna.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot,\u201d I cried, horrified, \u201cyou cannot mean that you suspect an\r\ninnocent child like this!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTa-ta-ta! Do not excite yourself! I have not said that I suspected\r\nher. But you must admit that her anxiety to know about the case is\r\nsomewhat unusual.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor once, I see further than you do,\u201d I said. \u201cHer anxiety is not for\r\nherself\u2014but for her mother.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy friend,\u201d said Poirot, \u201cas usual, you see nothing at all. Madame\r\nDaubreuil is very well able to look after herself without her daughter\r\nworrying about her. I admit I was teasing you just now, but all the\r\nsame I repeat what I said before. Do not set your heart on that girl.\r\nShe is not for you! I, Hercule Poirot, know it. _Sacr\u00e9!___ if only I\r\ncould remember where I had seen that face!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat face?\u201d I asked, surprised. \u201cThe daughter\u2019s?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. The mother\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\nNoting my surprise, he nodded emphatically.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut yes\u2014it is as I tell you. It was a long time ago, when I was still\r\nwith the Police in Belgium. I have never actually seen the woman\r\nbefore, but I have seen her picture\u2014and in connection with some case. I\r\nrather fancy\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI may be mistaken, but I rather fancy that it was a murder case!\u201d\r\n\nWe were up at the Villa betimes next morning. The man on guard at the\r\ngate did not bar our way this time. Instead, he respectfully saluted\r\nus, and we passed on to the house. The maid L\u00e9onie was just coming down\r\nthe stairs, and seemed not averse to the prospect of a little\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nPoirot inquired after the health of Mrs. Renauld.\r\n\r\nL\u00e9onie shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is terribly upset, _la pauvre dame!___ She will eat nothing\u2014but\r\nnothing! And she is as pale as a ghost. It is heartrending to see her.\r\nAh, _par exemple___, it is not I who would grieve like that for a man\r\nwho had deceived me with another woman!\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat you say is very just, but what will you? The heart of a woman who\r\nloves will forgive many blows. Still, undoubtedly there must have been\r\nmany scenes of recrimination between them in the last few months?\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain L\u00e9onie shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever, monsieur. Never have I heard Madame utter a word of protest\u2014of\r\nreproach, even! She had the temper and disposition of an angel\u2014quite\r\ndifferent to Monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur Renauld had not the temper of an angel?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFar from it. When he enraged himself, the whole house knew of it. The\r\nday that he quarrelled with M. Jack\u2014_ma foi!___ they might have been\r\nheard in the market place, they shouted so loud!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Poirot. \u201cAnd when did this quarrel take place?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! it was just before M. Jack went to Paris. Almost he missed his\r\ntrain. He came out of the library, and caught up his bag which he had\r\nleft in the hall. The automobile, it was being repaired, and he had to\r\nrun for the station. I was dusting the salon, and I saw him pass, and\r\nhis face was white\u2014white\u2014with two burning spots of red. Ah, but he was\r\nangry!\u201d\r\n\r\nL\u00e9onie was enjoying her narrative thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the dispute, what was it about?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that I do not know,\u201d confessed L\u00e9onie. \u201cIt is true that they\r\nshouted, but their voices were so loud and high, and they spoke so\r\nfast, that only one well acquainted with English could have\r\ncomprehended. But Monsieur, he was like a thundercloud all day!\r\nImpossible to please him!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe sound of a door shutting upstairs cut short L\u00e9onie\u2019s loquacity.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Fran\u00e7oise who awaits me!\u201d she exclaimed, awakening to a tardy\r\nremembrance of her duties. \u201cThat old one, she always scolds.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne moment, mademoiselle. The examining magistrate, where is he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have gone out to look at the automobile in the garage. Monsieur\r\nthe commissary had some idea that it might have been used on the night\r\nof the murder.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Quelle id\u00e9e___,\u201d murmured Poirot, as the girl disappeared.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will go out and join them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I shall await their return in the _salon___. It is cool there on\r\nthis hot morning.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis placid way of taking things did not quite commend itself to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind\u2014\u201d I said, and hesitated.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot in the least. You wish to investigate on your own account, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d rather like to have a look at Giraud, if he\u2019s anywhere\r\nabout, and see what he\u2019s up to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe human foxhound,\u201d murmured Poirot, as he leaned back in a\r\ncomfortable chair, and closed his eyes. \u201cBy all means, my friend. Au\r\nrevoir.\u201d\r\n\r\nI strolled out of the front door. It was certainly hot. I turned up the\r\npath we had taken the day before. I had a mind to study the scene of\r\nthe crime myself. I did not go directly to the spot, however, but\r\nturned aside into the bushes, so as to come out on the links some\r\nhundred yards or so further to the right. If Giraud were still on the\r\nspot, I wanted to observe his methods before he knew of my presence.\r\nBut the shrubbery here was much denser, and I had quite a struggle to\r\nforce my way through. When I emerged at last on the course, it was\r\nquite unexpectedly and with such vigour that I cannoned heavily into a\r\nyoung lady who had been standing with her back to the plantation.\r\n\r\nShe not unnaturally gave a suppressed shriek, but I, too, uttered an\r\nexclamation of surprise. For it was my friend of the train, Cinderella!\r\n\r\nThe surprise was mutual.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou,\u201d we both exclaimed simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThe young lady recovered herself first.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy only Aunt!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor the matter of that, what are you?\u201d I retorted.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen last I saw you, the day before yesterday, you were trotting home\r\nto England like a good little boy. Have they given you a season ticket\r\nto and fro, on the strength of your M.P.?\u201d\r\n\r\nI ignored the end of the speech.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen last I saw you,\u201d I said, \u201cyou were trotting home with your\r\nsister, like a good little girl. By the way, how is your sister?\u201d\r\n\r\nA flash of white teeth rewarded me.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow kind of you to ask! My sister is well, I thank you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is here with you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe remained in town,\u201d said the minx with dignity.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve got a sister,\u201d I laughed. \u201cIf you have, her\r\nname is Harris!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you remember mine?\u201d she asked, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cCinderella. But you\u2019re going to tell me the real one now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head with a wicked look.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot even why you\u2019re here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that! I suppose you\u2019ve heard of members of my profession\r\n\u2018resting.\u2019\u200a\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt expensive French watering-places?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDirt cheap if you know where to go.\u201d\r\n\r\nI eyed her keenly.\r\n\r\n\u201cStill, you\u2019d no intention of coming here when I met you two days ago?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe all have our disappointments,\u201d said Miss Cinderella sententiously.\r\n\u201cThere now, I\u2019ve told you quite as much as is good for you. Little boys\r\nshould not be inquisitive. You\u2019ve not yet told me what you\u2019re doing\r\nhere? Got the M.P. in tow, I suppose, doing the gay boy on the beach.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head. \u201cGuess again. You remember my telling you that my\r\ngreat friend was a detective?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd perhaps you\u2019ve heard about this crime\u2014at the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stared at me. Her breast heaved, and her eyes grew wide and round.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean\u2014that you\u2019re in on _that?___\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded. There was no doubt that I had scored heavily. Her emotion, as\r\nshe regarded me, was only too evident. For some few seconds, she\r\nremained silent, staring at me. Then she nodded her head emphatically.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, if that doesn\u2019t beat the band! Tote me round. I want to see all\r\nthe horrors.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I say. Bless the boy, didn\u2019t I tell you I doted on crimes? What\r\ndo you think I\u2019m imperilling my ankles for in high-heeled shoes over\r\nthis stubble? I\u2019ve been nosing round for hours. Tried the front way in,\r\nbut that old stick-in-the-mud of a French gendarme wasn\u2019t taking any. I\r\nguess Helen of Troy, and Cleopatra, and Mary, Queen of Scots, rolled in\r\none wouldn\u2019t cut ice with him! It\u2019s a real piece of luck happening on\r\nyou this way. Come on, show me all the sights.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut look here\u2014wait a minute\u2014I can\u2019t. Nobody\u2019s allowed in. They\u2019re\r\nawfully strict.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you and your friend the big bugs?\u201d\r\n\r\nI was loath to relinquish my position of importance.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy are you so keen?\u201d I asked weakly. \u201cAnd what is it you want to\r\nsee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, everything! The place where it happened, and the weapon, and the\r\nbody, and any finger-prints or interesting things like that. I\u2019ve never\r\nhad a chance of being right in on a murder like this before. It\u2019ll last\r\nme all my life?\u201d\r\n\r\nI turned away, sickened. What were women coming to nowadays? The girl\u2019s\r\nghoulish excitement nauseated me. I had read of the mobs of women who\r\nbesieged the law courts when some wretched man was being tried for his\r\nlife on the capital charge. I had sometimes wondered who these women\r\nwere. Now I knew. They were of the likeness of Cinderella, young, yet\r\nobsessed with a yearning for morbid excitement, for sensation at any\r\nprice, without regard to any decency or good feeling. The vividness of\r\nthe girl\u2019s beauty had attracted me in spite of myself, yet at heart I\r\nretained my first impression of disapproval and dislike. I thought of\r\nmy mother, long since dead. What would she have said of this strange\r\nmodern product of girlhood? The pretty face with the paint and powder,\r\nand the ghoulish mind behind!\r\n\r\n\u201cCome off your high horse,\u201d said the lady suddenly. \u201cAnd don\u2019t give\r\nyourself airs. When you got called to this job, did you put your nose\r\nin the air and say it was a nasty business, and you wouldn\u2019t be mixed\r\nup in it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019d been here on a holiday, wouldn\u2019t you be nosing round just the\r\nsame as I am? Of course you would.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a man. You\u2019re a woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour idea of a woman is some one who gets on a chair and shrieks if\r\nshe sees a mouse. That\u2019s all prehistoric. But you _will___ show me\r\nround, won\u2019t you? You see, it might make a big difference to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn what way?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re keeping all the reporters out. I might make a big scoop with\r\none of the papers. You don\u2019t know how much they pay for a bit of inside\r\nstuff.\u201d\r\n\r\nI hesitated. She slipped a small soft hand into mine.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Please___\u2014there\u2019s a dear.\u201d\r\n\r\nI capitulated. Secretly, I knew that I should rather enjoy the part of\r\nshowman. After all, the moral attitude displayed by the girl was none\r\nof my business. I was a little nervous as to what the examining\r\nmagistrate might say, but I reassured myself by the reflection that no\r\nharm could possibly be done.\r\n\r\nWe repaired first to the spot where the body had been discovered. A man\r\nwas on guard there, who saluted respectfully, knowing me by sight, and\r\nraised no question as to my companion. Presumably he regarded her as\r\nvouched for by me. I explained to Cinderella just how the discovery had\r\nbeen made, and she listened attentively, sometimes putting an\r\nintelligent question. Then we turned our steps in the direction of the\r\nVilla. I proceeded rather cautiously, for, truth to tell, I was not at\r\nall anxious to meet any one. I took the girl through the shrubbery\r\nround to the back of the house where the small shed was. I recollected\r\nthat yesterday evening, after relocking the door, M. Bex had left the\r\nkey with the _sergent de ville___ Marchaud, \u201cin case M. Giraud should\r\nrequire it while we are upstairs.\u201d I thought it quite likely that the\r\nS\u00fbret\u00e9 detective, after using it, had returned it to Marchaud again.\r\nLeaving the girl out of sight in the shrubbery, I entered the house.\r\nMarchaud was on duty outside the door of the _salon___. From within\r\ncame the murmur of voices.\r\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur desires Hautet? He is within. He is again interrogating\r\nFran\u00e7oise.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said hastily, \u201cI don\u2019t want him. But I should very much like\r\nthe key of the shed outside if it is not against regulations.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut certainly, monsieur.\u201d He produced it. \u201cHere it is. M. le juge gave\r\norders that all facilities were to be placed at your disposal. You will\r\nreturn it to me when you have finished out there, that is all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\r\n\r\nI felt a thrill of satisfaction as I realized that in Marchaud\u2019s eyes,\r\nat least, I ranked equally in importance with Poirot. The girl was\r\nwaiting for me. She gave an exclamation of delight as she saw the key\r\nin my hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got it then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said coolly. \u201cAll the same, you know, what I\u2019m doing is\r\nhighly irregular.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been a perfect duck, and I shan\u2019t forget it. Come along. They\r\ncan\u2019t see us from the house, can they?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWait a minute.\u201d I arrested her eager advance. \u201cI won\u2019t stop you if you\r\nreally wish to go in. But do you? You\u2019ve seen the grave, and the\r\ngrounds, and you\u2019ve heard all the details of the affair. Isn\u2019t that\r\nenough for you? This is going to be gruesome, you know,\r\nand\u2014unpleasant.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe looked at me for a moment with an expression that I could not quite\r\nfathom. Then she laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cMe for the horrors,\u201d she said. \u201cCome along.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn silence we arrived at the door of the shed. I opened it and we\r\npassed in. I walked over to the body, and gently pulled down the sheet\r\nas M. Bex had done the preceding afternoon. A little gasping sound\r\nescaped from the girl\u2019s lips, and I turned and looked at her. There was\r\nhorror on her face now, and those debonair high spirits of hers were\r\nquenched utterly. She had not chosen to listen to my advice, and she\r\nwas punished now for her disregard of it. I felt singularly merciless\r\ntowards her. She should go through with it now. I turned the corpse\r\ngently over.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d I said, \u201che was stabbed in the back.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer voice was almost soundless.\r\n\r\n\u201cWith what?\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded towards the glass jar.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat dagger.\u201d\r\n\r\nSuddenly the girl reeled, and then sank down in a heap. I sprang to her\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are faint. Come out of here. It has been too much for you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWater,\u201d she murmured. \u201cQuick. Water.\u200a\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\nI left her, and rushed into the house. Fortunately none of the servants\r\nwere about, and I was able to secure a glass of water unobserved and\r\nadd a few drops of brandy from a pocket flask. In a few minutes I was\r\nback again. The girl was lying as I had left her, but a few sips of the\r\nbrandy and water revived her in a marvellous manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake me out of here\u2014oh, quickly, quickly!\u201d she cried, shuddering.\r\n\r\nSupporting her with my arm I led her out into the air, and she pulled\r\nthe door to behind her. Then she drew a deep breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better. Oh, it was horrible! Why did you ever let me go in?\u201d\r\n\r\nI felt this to be so feminine that I could not forbear a smile.\r\nSecretly, I was not dissatisfied with her collapse. It proved that she\r\nwas not quite so callous as I had thought her. After all she was little\r\nmore than a child, and her curiosity had probably been of the\r\nunthinking order.\r\n\r\n\u201cI did my best to stop you, you know,\u201d I said gently.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose you did. Well, good-bye.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here, you can\u2019t start off like that\u2014all alone. You\u2019re not fit for\r\nit. I insist on accompanying you back to Merlinville.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNonsense. I\u2019m quite all right now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSupposing you felt faint again? No, I shall come with you.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut this she combated with a good deal of energy. In the end, however,\r\nI prevailed so far as to be allowed to accompany her to the outskirts\r\nof the town. We retraced our steps over our former route, passing the\r\ngrave again, and making a detour on to the road. Where the first\r\nstraggling line of shops began, she stopped and held out her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-bye, and thank you ever so much for coming with me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re all right now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite, thanks. I hope you won\u2019t get into any trouble over showing me\r\nthings?\u201d\r\n\r\nI disclaimed the idea lightly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, good-bye.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAu revoir,\u201d I corrected. \u201cIf you\u2019re staying here, we shall meet\r\nagain.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe flashed a smile at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so. Au revoir, then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWait a second, you haven\u2019t told me your address?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m staying at the H\u00f4tel du Phare. It\u2019s a little place, but quite\r\ngood. Come and look me up tomorrow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will,\u201d I said, with perhaps rather unnecessary _empressement___.\r\n\r\nI watched her out of sight, then turned and retraced my steps to the\r\nVilla. I remembered that I had not relocked the door of the shed.\r\nFortunately no one had noticed the oversight, and turning the key I\r\nremoved it and returned it to the _sergent de ville___. And, as I did\r\nso, it came upon me suddenly that though Cinderella had given me her\r\naddress I still did not know her name.\r\n\nIn the _Salon___ I found the examining magistrate busily interrogating\r\nthe old gardener Auguste. Poirot and the commissary, who were both\r\npresent, greeted me respectively with a smile and a polite bow. I\r\nslipped quietly into a seat. M. Hautet was painstaking and meticulous\r\nin the extreme, but did not succeed in eliciting anything of\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe gardening gloves Auguste admitted to be his. He wore them when\r\nhandling a certain species of primula plant which was poisonous to some\r\npeople. He could not say when he had worn them last. Certainly he had\r\nnot missed them. Where were they kept? Sometimes in one place,\r\nsometimes in another. The spade was usually to be found in the small\r\ntool shed. Was it locked? Of course it was locked. Where was the key\r\nkept? _Parbleu___, it was in the door of course! There was nothing of\r\nvalue to steal. Who would have expected a party of bandits, of\r\nassassins? Such things did not happen in Madame la Vicomtesse\u2019s time.\r\nM. Hautet signifying that he had finished with him, the old man\r\nwithdrew, grumbling to the last. Remembering Poirot\u2019s unaccountable\r\ninsistence on the footprints in the flower beds, I scrutinized him\r\nnarrowly as he gave his evidence. Either he had nothing to do with the\r\ncrime or he was a consummate actor. Suddenly, just as he was going out\r\nof the door, an idea struck me. \u201c_Pardon___ M. Hautet,\u201d I cried, \u201cbut\r\nwill you permit me to ask him one question?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut certainly, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, I turned to Auguste.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere do you keep your boots?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Sac \u00e0 papier!___\u201d growled the old man. \u201cOn my feet. Where else?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut when you go to bed at night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUnder my bed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut who cleans them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNobody. Why should they be cleaned? Is it that I promenade myself on\r\nthe front like a young man? On Sunday I wear the Sunday boots, _bien\r\nentendu___, but otherwise\u2014!\u201d he shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\nI shook my head, discouraged.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said the magistrate. \u201cWe do not advance very much.\r\nUndoubtedly we are held up until we get the return cable from Santiago.\r\nHas any one seen Giraud? In verity that one lacks politeness! I have a\r\nvery good mind to send for him and\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will not have to send far, M. le juge.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe quiet voice startled us. Giraud was standing outside looking in\r\nthrough the open window.\r\n\r\nHe leaped lightly into the room, and advanced to the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere I am, M. le juge, at your service. Accept my excuses for not\r\npresenting myself sooner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. Not at all,\u201d said the magistrate, rather confused.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course I am only a detective,\u201d continued the other. \u201cI know nothing\r\nof interrogatories. Were I conducting one, I should be inclined to do\r\nso without an open window. Any one standing outside can so easily hear\r\nall that passes.\u200a\u2026 But no matter.\u201d\r\n\r\nM. Hautet flushed angrily. There was evidently going to be no love lost\r\nbetween the examining magistrate and the detective in charge of the\r\ncase. They had fallen foul of each other at the start. Perhaps in any\r\nevent it would have been much the same. To Giraud, all examining\r\nmagistrates were fools, and to M. Hautet who took himself seriously,\r\nthe casual manner of the Paris detective could not fail to give\r\noffence.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien___, M. Giraud,\u201d said the magistrate rather sharply. \u201cWithout\r\ndoubt you have been employing your time to a marvel? You have the names\r\nof the assassins for us, have you not? And also the precise spot where\r\nthey find themselves now?\u201d\r\n\r\nUnmoved by this irony, Giraud replied:\r\n\r\n\u201cI know at least where they have come from.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Comment?___\u201d\r\n\r\nGiraud took two small objects from his pocket and laid them down on the\r\ntable. We crowded round. The objects were very simple ones: the stub of\r\na cigarette, and an unlighted match. The detective wheeled round on\r\nPoirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you see there?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\nThere was something almost brutal in his tone. It made my cheeks flush.\r\nBut Poirot remained unmoved. He shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cA cigarette end, and a match.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what does that tell you?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot spread out his hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt tells me\u2014nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Giraud, in a satisfied voice. \u201cYou haven\u2019t made a study of\r\nthese things. That\u2019s not an ordinary match\u2014not in this country at\r\nleast. It\u2019s common enough in South America. Luckily it\u2019s unlighted. I\r\nmightn\u2019t have recognized it otherwise. Evidently one of the men threw\r\naway his cigarette end, and lit another, spilling one match out of the\r\nbox as he did so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the other match?\u201d asked Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich match?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe one he _did___ light his cigarette with. You have found that\r\nalso?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps you didn\u2019t search very thoroughly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot search thoroughly\u2014\u201d For a moment it seemed as though the detective\r\nwere going to break out angrily, but with an effort he controlled\r\nhimself. \u201cI see you love a joke, M. Poirot. But in any case, match or\r\nno match, the cigarette end would be sufficient. It is a South American\r\ncigarette with liquorice pectoral paper.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot bowed. The commissary spoke:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe cigarette end and match might have belonged to M. Renauld.\r\nRemember, it is only two years since he returned from South America.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied the other confidently. \u201cI have already searched among the\r\neffects of M. Renauld. The cigarettes he smoked and the matches he used\r\nare quite different.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do not think it odd,\u201d asked Poirot, \u201cthat these strangers should\r\ncome unprovided with a weapon, with gloves, with a spade, and that they\r\nshould so conveniently find all these things?\u201d\r\n\r\nGiraud smiled in a rather superior manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cUndoubtedly it is strange. Indeed, without the theory that I hold, it\r\nwould be inexplicable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAha!\u201d said M. Hautet. \u201cAn accomplice. An accomplice within the house!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOr outside it,\u201d said Giraud with a peculiar smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut some one must have admitted them? We cannot allow that, by an\r\nunparalleled piece of good fortune, they found the door ajar for them\r\nto walk in?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_D\u2019accord___, M. le juge. The door was opened for them, but it could\r\njust as easily be opened from outside\u2014by some one who possessed a key.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut who did possess a key?\u201d\r\n\r\nGiraud shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs for that, no one who possesses one is going to admit the fact if\r\nthey can help it. But several people _might___ have had one. M. Jack\r\nRenauld, the son, for instance. It is true that he is on his way to\r\nSouth America, but he might have lost the key or had it stolen from\r\nhim. Then there is the gardener\u2014he has been here many years. One of the\r\nyounger servants may have a lover. It is easy to take an impression of\r\na key and have one cut. There are many possibilities. Then there is\r\nanother person who, I should judge, is exceedingly likely to have such\r\na thing in her keeping.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho is that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame Daubreuil,\u201d said the detective dryly.\r\n\r\n\u201cEh, eh!\u201d said the magistrate, his face falling a little, \u201cso you have\r\nheard about that, have you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hear everything,\u201d said Giraud imperturbably.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is one thing I could swear you have not heard,\u201d said M. Hautet,\r\ndelighted to be able to show superior knowledge, and without more ado,\r\nhe retailed the story of the mysterious visitor the night before. He\r\nalso touched on the cheque made out to \u201cDuveen,\u201d and finally handed\r\nGiraud the letter signed \u201cBella.\u201d\r\n\r\nGiraud listened in silence, studied the letter attentively, and then\r\nhanded it back.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll very interesting, M. le juge. But my theory remains unaffected.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your theory is?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor the moment I prefer not to say. Remember, I am only just beginning\r\nmy investigations.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me one thing, M. Giraud,\u201d said Poirot suddenly. \u201cYour theory\r\nallows for the door being opened. It does not explain why it was\r\n_left___ open. When they departed, would it not have been natural for\r\nthem to close it behind them. If a _sergent de ville___ had chanced to\r\ncome up to the house, as is sometimes done to see that all is well,\r\nthey might have been discovered and overtaken almost at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBah! They forgot it. A mistake, I grant you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen, to my surprise, Poirot uttered almost the same words as he had\r\nuttered to Bex the previous evening:\r\n\r\n\u201c_I do not agree with you.___ The door being left open was the result\r\nof either design or necessity, and any theory that does not admit that\r\nfact is bound to prove vain.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe all regarded the little man with a good deal of astonishment. The\r\nconfession of ignorance drawn from him over the match end had, I\r\nthought, been bound to humiliate him, but here he was self satisfied as\r\never, laying down the law to the great Giraud without a tremor.\r\n\r\nThe detective twisted his moustache, eyeing my friend in a somewhat\r\nbantering fashion.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t agree with me, eh? Well, what strikes you particularly about\r\nthe case. Let\u2019s hear your views.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne thing presents itself to me as being significant. Tell me, M.\r\nGiraud, does nothing strike you as familiar about this case? Is there\r\nnothing it reminds you of?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFamiliar? Reminds me of? I can\u2019t say off-hand. I don\u2019t think so,\r\nthough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are wrong,\u201d said Poirot quietly. \u201cA crime almost precisely similar\r\nhas been committed before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen? And where?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that, unfortunately, I cannot for the moment remember\u2014but I shall\r\ndo so. I had hoped you might be able to assist me.\u201d\r\n\r\nGiraud snorted incredulously.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere have been many affairs of masked men! I cannot remember the\r\ndetails of them all. These crimes all resemble each other more or\r\nless.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is such a thing as the individual touch.\u201d Poirot suddenly\r\nassumed his lecturing manner, and addressed us collectively. \u201cI am\r\nspeaking to you now of the psychology of crime. M. Giraud knows quite\r\nwell that each criminal has his particular method, and that the police,\r\nwhen called in to investigate\u2014say a case of burglary\u2014can often make a\r\nshrewd guess at the offender, simply by the peculiar method he has\r\nemployed. (Japp would tell you the same, Hastings.) Man is an\r\nunoriginal animal. Unoriginal within the law in his daily respectable\r\nlife, equally unoriginal outside the law. If a man commits a crime, any\r\nother crime he commits will resemble it closely. The English murderer\r\nwho disposed of his wives in succession by drowning them in their baths\r\nwas a case in point. Had he varied his methods, he might have escaped\r\ndetection to this day. But he obeyed the common dictates of human\r\nnature, arguing that what had once succeeded would succeed again, and\r\nhe paid the penalty of his lack of originality.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the point of all this?\u201d sneered Giraud.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat when you have two crimes precisely similar in design and\r\nexecution, you find the same brain behind them both. I am looking for\r\nthat brain, M. Giraud\u2014and I shall find it. Here we have a true clue\u2014a\r\npsychological clue. You may know all about cigarettes and match ends,\r\nM. Giraud, but I, Hercule Poirot, know the mind of man!\u201d And the\r\nridiculous little fellow tapped his forehead with emphasis.\r\n\r\nGiraud remained singularly unimpressed.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor your guidance,\u201d continued Poirot, \u201cI will also advise you of one\r\nfact which might fail to be brought to your notice. The wrist watch of\r\nMadame Renauld, on the day following the tragedy, had gained two hours.\r\nIt might interest you to examine it.\u201d\r\n\r\nGiraud stared.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps it was in the habit of gaining?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, I am told it did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien___, then!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll the same, two hours is a good deal,\u201d said Poirot softly. \u201cThen\r\nthere is the matter of the footprints in the flower-bed.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe nodded his head towards the open window. Giraud took two eager\r\nstrides, and looked out.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis bed here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I see no footprints?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Poirot, straightening a little pile of books on a table.\r\n\u201cThere are none.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment an almost murderous rage obscured Giraud\u2019s face. He took\r\ntwo strides towards his tormentor, but at that moment the _salon___\r\ndoor was opened, and Marchaud announced.\r\n\r\n\u201cM. Stonor, the secretary, has just arrived from England. May he\r\nenter?\u201d\r\n\nThe man who entered the room was a striking figure. Very tall, with a\r\nwell knit athletic frame, and a deeply bronzed face and neck, he\r\ndominated the assembly. Even Giraud seemed anaemic beside him. When I\r\nknew him better I realized that Gabriel Stonor was quite an unusual\r\npersonality. English by birth, he had knocked about all over the world.\r\nHe had shot big game in Africa, travelled in Korea, ranched in\r\nCalifornia, and traded in the South Sea Islands. He had been secretary\r\nto a New York railway magnate, and had spent a year encamped in the\r\ndesert with a friendly tribe of Arabs.\r\n\r\nHis unerring eye picked out M. Hautet.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe examining magistrate in charge of the case? Pleased to meet you,\r\nM. le juge. This is a terrible business. How\u2019s Mrs. Renauld? Is she\r\nbearing up fairly well? It must have been an awful shock to her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTerrible, terrible,\u201d said M. Hautet. \u201cPermit me to introduce M.\r\nBex\u2014our commissary of police, M. Giraud of the S\u00fbret\u00e9. This gentleman\r\nis M. Hercule Poirot. M. Renauld sent for him, but he arrived too late\r\nto do anything to avert the tragedy. A friend of M. Poirot\u2019s, Captain\r\nHastings.\u201d\r\n\r\nStonor looked at Poirot with some interest.\r\n\r\n\u201cSent for you, did he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did not know, then, that M. Renauld contemplated calling in a\r\ndetective?\u201d interposed M. Bex.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. But it doesn\u2019t surprise me a bit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause the old man was rattled! I don\u2019t know what it was all about.\r\nHe didn\u2019t confide in me. We weren\u2019t on those terms. But rattled he\r\nwas\u2014and badly!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cH\u2019m!\u201d said M. Hautet. \u201cBut you have no notion of the cause?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will pardon me, M. Stonor, but we must begin with a few\r\nformalities. Your name?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGabriel Stonor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow long ago was it that you became secretary to M. Renauld?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout two years ago, when he first arrived from South America. I met\r\nhim through a mutual friend, and he offered me the post. A thundering\r\ngood boss he was too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid he talk to you much about his life in South America?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, a good bit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know if he was ever in Santiago?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSeveral times, I believe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe never mentioned any special incident that occurred there\u2014anything\r\nthat might have provoked some vendetta against him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid he speak of any secret that he had acquired whilst sojourning\r\nthere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid he ever say anything at all about a secret?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot that I can remember. But, for all that, there _was___ a mystery\r\nabout him. I\u2019ve never heard him speak of his boyhood for instance, or\r\nof any incident prior to his arrival in South America. He was a French\r\nCanadian by birth, I believe, but I\u2019ve never heard him speak of his\r\nlife in Canada. He could shut up like a clam if he liked.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo, as far as you know, he had no enemies, and you can give us no clue\r\nas to any secret to obtain possession of which he might have been\r\nmurdered?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cM. Stonor, have you ever heard the name of Duveen in connection with\r\nM. Renauld?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDuveen. Duveen.\u201d He tried the name over thoughtfully. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\r\nhave. And yet it seems familiar.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know a lady, a friend of M. Renauld\u2019s whose Christian name is\r\nBella?\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain Mr. Stonor shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cBella Duveen? Is that the full name? It\u2019s curious! I\u2019m sure I know it.\r\nBut for the moment I can\u2019t remember in what connection.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe magistrate coughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou understand, M. Stonor\u2014the case is like this. _There must be no\r\nreservations.___ You might, perhaps, through a feeling of consideration\r\nfor Madame Renauld\u2014for whom, I gather, you have a great esteem and\r\naffection, you might\u2014_enfin!___\u201d said M. Hautet getting rather tied up\r\nin his sentence, \u201cthere must absolutely be no reservations.\u201d\r\n\r\nStonor stared at him, a dawning light of comprehension in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t quite get you,\u201d he said gently. \u201cWhere does Mrs. Renauld come\r\nin? I\u2019ve an immense respect and affection for that lady; she\u2019s a very\r\nwonderful and unusual type, but I don\u2019t quite see how my reservations,\r\nor otherwise, could affect her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot if this Bella Duveen should prove to have been something more than\r\na friend to her husband?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Stonor. \u201cI get you now. But I\u2019ll bet my bottom dollar that\r\nyou\u2019re wrong. The old man never so much as looked at a petticoat. He\r\njust adored his own wife. They were the most devoted couple I know.\u201d\r\n\r\nM. Hautet shook his head gently.\r\n\r\n\u201cM. Stonor, we hold absolute proof\u2014a love letter written by this Bella\r\nto M. Renauld, accusing him of having tired of her. Moreover, we have\r\nfurther proof that, at the time of his death, he was carrying on an\r\nintrigue with a Frenchwoman, a Madame Daubreuil, who rents the\r\nadjoining Villa. And this is the man who, according to you, never\r\nlooked at a petticoat!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe secretary\u2019s eyes narrowed.\r\n\r\n\u201cHold on, M. le juge. You\u2019re barking up the wrong tree. I knew Paul\r\nRenauld. What you\u2019ve just been saying is utterly impossible. There\u2019s\r\nsome other explanation.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe magistrate shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat other explanation could there be?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat leads you to think it was a love affair?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame Daubreuil was in the habit of visiting him here in the\r\nevenings. Also, since M. Renauld came to the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve, Madame\r\nDaubreuil has paid large sums of money into the bank in notes. In all,\r\nthe amount totals four thousand pounds of your English money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s right,\u201d said Stonor quietly. \u201cI transmitted him those\r\nsums at his request. But it wasn\u2019t an intrigue.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEh! _mon Dieu!___ What else could it be?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Blackmail___,\u201d said Stonor sharply, bringing down his hand with a\r\nslam on the table. \u201cThat\u2019s what it was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! Voil\u00e0 une id\u00e9e!\u201d cried the magistrate, shaken in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cBlackmail,\u201d repeated Stonor. \u201cThe old man was being bled\u2014and at a good\r\nrate too. Four thousand in a couple of months. Whew! I told you just\r\nnow there was a mystery about Renauld. Evidently this Madame Daubreuil\r\nknew enough of it to put the screws on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is possible,\u201d the commissary cried excitedly. \u201cDecidedly, it is\r\npossible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPossible?\u201d roared Stonor. \u201cIt\u2019s certain! Tell me, have you asked Mrs.\r\nRenauld about this love affair stunt of yours?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, monsieur. We did not wish to occasion her any distress if it could\r\nreasonably be avoided.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDistress? Why, she\u2019d laugh in your face. I tell you, she and Renauld\r\nwere a couple in a hundred.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that reminds me of another point,\u201d said M. Hautet. \u201cDid M. Renauld\r\ntake you into his confidence at all as to the dispositions of his\r\nwill?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know all about it\u2014took it to the lawyer for him after he\u2019d drawn it\r\nout. I can give you the name of his solicitors if you want to see it.\r\nThey\u2019ve got it there. Quite simple. Half in trust to his wife for her\r\nlifetime, the other half to his son. A few legacies. I rather think he\r\nleft me a thousand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen was this will drawn up?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, about a year and a half ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould it surprise you very much, M. Stonor, to hear that M. Renauld\r\nhad made another will, less than a fortnight ago?\u201d\r\n\r\nStonor was obviously very much surprised.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d no idea of it. What\u2019s it like?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe whole of his vast fortune is left unreservedly to his wife. There\r\nis no mention of his son.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Stonor gave vent to a prolonged whistle.\r\n\r\n\u201cI call that rather rough on the lad. His mother adores him, of course,\r\nbut to the world at large it looks rather like a want of confidence on\r\nhis father\u2019s part. It will be rather galling to his pride. Still, it\r\nall goes to prove what I told you, that Renauld and his wife were on\r\nfirst rate terms.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so, quite so,\u201d said M. Hautet. \u201cIt is possible we shall have to\r\nrevise our ideas on several points. We have, of course, cabled to\r\nSantiago, and are expecting a reply from there any minute. In all\r\npossibility, everything will then be perfectly clear and\r\nstraightforward. On the other hand, if your suggestion of blackmail is\r\ntrue, Madame Daubreuil ought to be able to give us valuable\r\ninformation.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot interjected a remark:\r\n\r\n\u201cM. Stonor, the English chauffeur, Masters, had he been long with M.\r\nRenauld?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOver a year?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you any idea whether he has ever been in South America?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m quite sure he hasn\u2019t. Before coming to Mr. Renauld, he had been\r\nfor many years with some people in Gloucestershire whom I know well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn fact, you can answer for him as being above suspicion?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot seemed somewhat crest-fallen.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the magistrate had summoned Marchaud.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy compliments to Madame Renauld, and I should be glad to speak to her\r\nfor a few minutes. Beg her not to disturb herself. I will wait upon her\r\nupstairs.\u201d\r\n\r\nMarchaud saluted and disappeared.\r\n\r\nWe waited some minutes, and then, to our surprise, the door opened, and\r\nMrs. Renauld, deathly pale in her heavy mourning, entered the room.\r\n\r\nM. Hautet brought forward a chair, uttering vigorous protestations, and\r\nshe thanked him with a smile. Stonor was holding one hand of hers in\r\nhis with an eloquent sympathy. Words evidently failed him. Mrs. Renauld\r\nturned to M. Hautet.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou wished to ask me something, M. le juge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWith your permission, madame. I understand your husband was a French\r\nCanadian by birth. Can you tell me anything of his youth, or\r\nupbringing?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy husband was always very reticent about himself, monsieur. He came\r\nfrom the North West, I know, but I fancy that he had an unhappy\r\nchildhood, for he never cared to speak of that time. Our life was lived\r\nentirely in the present and the future.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas there any mystery in his past life?\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Renauld smiled a little, and shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing so romantic, I am sure, M. le juge.\u201d\r\n\r\nM. Hautet also smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue, we must not permit ourselves to get melodramatic. There is one\r\nthing more\u2014\u201d he hesitated.\r\n\r\nStonor broke in impetuously:\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got an extraordinary idea into their heads Mrs. Renauld. They\r\nactually fancy that Mr. Renauld was carrying on an intrigue with a\r\nMadame Daubreuil who, it seems, lives next door.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe scarlet colour flamed into Mrs. Renauld\u2019s cheeks. She flung her\r\nhead up, then bit her lip, her face quivering. Stonor stood looking at\r\nher in astonishment, but M. Bex leaned forward and said gently: \u201cWe\r\nregret to cause you pain, madame, but have you any reason to believe\r\nthat Madame Daubreuil was your husband\u2019s mistress?\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a sob of anguish, Mrs. Renauld buried her face in her hands. Her\r\nshoulders heaved convulsively. At last she lifted her head, and said\r\nbrokenly:\r\n\r\n\u201cShe may have been.\u201d\r\n\r\nNever, in all my life, have I seen anything to equal the blank\r\namazement on Stonor\u2019s face. He was thoroughly taken aback.\r\n\nWhat the next development of the conversation would have been, I cannot\r\nsay, for at that moment the door was thrown violently open, and a tall\r\nyoung man strode into the room.\r\n\r\nJust for a moment I had the uncanny sensation that the dead man had\r\ncome to life again. Then I realized that this dark head was untouched\r\nwith grey, and that, in point of fact, it was a mere boy who now burst\r\nin among us with so little ceremony. He went straight to Mrs. Renauld\r\nwith an impetuosity that took no heed of the presence of others.\r\n\r\n\u201cMother!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJack!\u201d With a cry she folded him in her arms. \u201cMy dearest! But what\r\nbrings you here? You were to sail on the _Anzora___ from Cherbourg two\r\ndays ago?\u201d Then, suddenly recalling to herself the presence of others,\r\nshe turned with a certain dignity, \u201cMy son, messieurs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAha!\u201d said M. Hautet, acknowledging the young man\u2019s bow. \u201cSo you did\r\nnot sail on the _Anzora?___\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, monsieur. As I was about to explain, the _Anzora___ was detained\r\ntwenty-four hours through engine trouble. I should have sailed last\r\nnight instead of the night before, but, happening to buy an evening\r\npaper, I saw in it an account of the\u2014the awful tragedy that had\r\nbefallen us\u2014\u201d His voice broke and the tears came into his eyes. \u201cMy\r\npoor father\u2014my poor, poor, father.\u201d\r\n\r\nStaring at him like one in a dream, Mrs. Renauld repeated: \u201cSo you did\r\nnot sail?\u201d And then, with a gesture of infinite weariness, she murmured\r\nas though to herself, \u201cAfter all, it does not matter\u2014now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSit down, M. Renauld, I beg of you,\u201d said M. Hautet, indicating a\r\nchair. \u201cMy sympathy for you is profound. It must have been a terrible\r\nshock to you to learn the news as you did. However, it is most\r\nfortunate that you were prevented from sailing. I am in hopes that you\r\nmay be able to give us just the information we need to clear up this\r\nmystery.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am at your disposal, M. le juge. Ask me any questions you please.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo begin with, I understand that this journey was being undertaken at\r\nyour father\u2019s request?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so, M. le juge. I received a telegram bidding me to proceed\r\nwithout delay to Buenos Ayres, and from thence via the Andes to\r\nValparaiso and on to Santiago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh. And the object of this journey?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no idea, M. le juge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. See, here is the telegram.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe magistrate took it and read it aloud.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u200a\u2018Proceed immediately Cherbourg embark _Anzora___ sailing tonight\r\nBuenos Ayres. Ultimate destination Santiago. Further instructions will\r\nawait you Buenos Ayres. Do not fail. Matter is of utmost importance.\r\nRenauld.\u2019 And there had been no previous correspondence on the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\nJack Renauld shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is the only intimation of any kind. I knew, of course, that my\r\nfather, having lived so long out there, had necessarily many interests\r\nin South America. But he had never mooted any suggestion of sending me\r\nout.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have, of course, been a good deal in South America, M. Renauld?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was there as a child. But I was educated in England, and spent most\r\nof my holidays in that country, so I really know far less of South\r\nAmerica than might be supposed. You see, the war broke out when I was\r\nseventeen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou served in the English Flying Corps, did you not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, M. le juge.\u201d\r\n\r\nM. Hautet nodded his head, and proceeded with his inquiries along the,\r\nby now, well-known lines. In response, Jack Renauld declared definitely\r\nthat he knew nothing of any enmity his father might have incurred in\r\nthe city of Santiago, or elsewhere in the South American continent,\r\nthat he had noticed no change in his father\u2019s manner of late, and that\r\nhe had never heard him refer to a secret. He had regarded the mission\r\nto South America as connected with business interests.\r\n\r\nAs M. Hautet paused for a minute, the quiet voice of Giraud broke in.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like to put a few questions on my own account, M. le juge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy all means, M. Giraud, if you wish,\u201d said the magistrate coldly.\r\n\r\nGiraud edged his chair a little nearer to the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cWere you on good terms with your father, M. Renauld?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly I was,\u201d returned the lad haughtily.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou assert that positively?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo little disputes, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\nJack shrugged his shoulders. \u201cEvery one may have a difference of\r\nopinion now and then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so, quite so. But if any one were to assert that you had a\r\nviolent quarrel with your father on the eve of your departure for\r\nParis, that person, without doubt, would be lying?\u201d\r\n\r\nI could not but admire the ingenuity of Giraud. His boast \u201cI know\r\neverything\u201d had been no idle one. Jack Renauld was clearly disconcerted\r\nby the question.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2014we did have an argument,\u201d he admitted.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, an argument! In the course of that argument did you use this\r\nphrase: \u2018When you are dead, I can do as I please?\u2019\u200a\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI may have done,\u201d muttered the other. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn response to that, did your father say: \u2018But I am not dead yet!\u2019 To\r\nwhich you responded: \u2018I wish you were!\u2019\u200a\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boy made no answer. His hands fiddled nervously with the things on\r\nthe table in front of him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must request an answer, please, M. Renauld,\u201d said Giraud sharply.\r\n\r\nWith an angry exclamation, the boy swept a heavy paper-knife on to the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat does it matter? You might as well know. Yes, I did quarrel with\r\nmy father. I dare say I said all those things\u2014I was so angry I cannot\r\neven remember what I said! I was furious\u2014I could almost have killed him\r\nat that moment\u2014there, make the most of that!\u201d He leant back in his\r\nchair, flushed and defiant.\r\n\r\nGiraud smiled, then, moving his chair back a little, said:\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is all. You would, without doubt, prefer to continue the\r\ninterrogatory, M. le juge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes, exactly,\u201d said M. Hautet. \u201cAnd what was the subject of your\r\nquarrel?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI decline to state.\u201d\r\n\r\nM. Hautet sat up in his chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cM. Renauld, it is not permitted to trifle with the law!\u201d he thundered.\r\n\u201cWhat was the subject of the quarrel?\u201d\r\n\r\nYoung Renauld remained silent, his boyish face sullen and overcast. But\r\nanother voice spoke, imperturbable and calm, the voice of Hercule\r\nPoirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will inform you, if you like, M. le juge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly I know. The subject of the quarrel was Mademoiselle Marthe\r\nDaubreuil.\u201d\r\n\r\nRenauld sprang round, startled. The magistrate leaned forward.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs this so, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\nJack Renauld bowed his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI love Mademoiselle Daubreuil, and I wish to marry\r\nher. When I informed my father of the fact, he flew at once into a\r\nviolent rage. Naturally I could not stand hearing the girl I loved\r\ninsulted, and I, too, lost my temper.\u201d\r\n\r\nM. Hautet looked across at Mrs. Renauld.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were aware of this\u2014attachment, madame.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI feared it,\u201d she replied simply.\r\n\r\n\u201cMother,\u201d cried the boy. \u201cYou too! Marthe is as good as she is\r\nbeautiful. What can you have against her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have nothing against Mademoiselle Daubreuil in any way. But I should\r\nprefer you to marry an Englishwoman, or if a Frenchwoman not one who\r\nhas a mother of doubtful antecedents!\u201d\r\n\r\nHer rancour against the older woman showed plainly in her voice, and I\r\ncould well understand that it must have been a bitter blow to her when\r\nher only son showed signs of falling in love with the daughter of her\r\nrival.\r\n\r\nMrs. Renauld continued, addressing the magistrate:\r\n\r\n\u201cI ought, perhaps, to have spoken to my husband on the subject, but I\r\nhoped that it was only a boy and girl flirtation which would blow over\r\nall the quicker if no notice was taken of it. I blame myself now for my\r\nsilence, but my husband, as I told you, had seemed so anxious and\r\ncare-worn, different altogether from his normal self, that I was\r\nchiefly concerned not to give him any additional worry.\u201d\r\n\r\nM. Hautet nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you informed your father of your intentions towards Mademoiselle\r\nDaubreuil,\u201d he resumed, \u201che was surprised?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe seemed completely taken aback. Then he ordered me peremptorily to\r\ndismiss any such idea from my mind. He would never give his consent to\r\nsuch a marriage. Nettled, I demanded what he had against Mademoiselle\r\nDaubreuil. To that he could give no satisfactory reply, but spoke in\r\nslighting terms of the mystery surrounding the lives of the mother and\r\ndaughter. I answered that I was marrying Marthe, and not her\r\nantecedents, but he shouted me down with a peremptory refusal to\r\ndiscuss the matter in any way. The whole thing must be given up. The\r\ninjustice and high-handedness of it all maddened me\u2014especially since he\r\nhimself always seemed to go out of his way to be attentive to the\r\nDaubreuils and was always suggesting that they should be asked to the\r\nhouse. I lost my head, and we quarrelled in earnest. My father reminded\r\nme that I was entirely dependent on him, and it must have been in\r\nanswer to that that I made the remark about doing as I pleased after\r\nhis death\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot interrupted with a quick question.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were aware, then, of the terms of your father\u2019s will?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI knew that he had left half his fortune to me, the other half in\r\ntrust for my mother to come to me at her death,\u201d replied the lad.\r\n\r\n\u201cProceed with your story,\u201d said the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter that we shouted at each other in sheer rage, until I suddenly\r\nrealized that I was in danger of missing my train to Paris. I had to\r\nrun for the station, still in a white heat of fury. However, once well\r\naway, I calmed down. I wrote to Marthe, telling her what had happened,\r\nand her reply soothed me still further. She pointed out to me that we\r\nhad only to be steadfast, and any opposition was bound to give way at\r\nlast. Our affection for each other must be tried and proved, and when\r\nmy parents realized that it was no light infatuation on my part they\r\nwould doubtless relent towards us. Of course, to her, I had not dwelt\r\non my father\u2019s principal objection to the match. I soon saw that I\r\nshould do my cause no good by violence. My father wrote me several\r\nletters to Paris, affectionate in tone, and which did not refer to our\r\ndisagreement or its cause, and I replied in the same strain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can produce those letters, eh?\u201d said Giraud.\r\n\r\n\u201cI did not keep them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo matter,\u201d said the detective.\r\n\r\nRenauld looked at him for a moment, but the magistrate was continuing\r\nhis questions.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo pass to another matter, are you acquainted with the name of Duveen,\r\nM. Renauld?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDuveen?\u201d said Jack. \u201cDuveen?\u201d He leant forward, and slowly picked up\r\nthe paper-knife he had swept from the table. As he lifted his head, his\r\neyes met the watching ones of Giraud. \u201cDuveen? No, I can\u2019t say I am.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you read this letter, M. Renauld? And tell me if you have any\r\nidea as to who the person was who addressed it to your father?\u201d\r\n\r\nJack Renauld took the letter, and read it through, the colour mounting\r\nin his face as he did so.\r\n\r\n\u201cAddressed to my father?\u201d The emotion and indignation in his tones were\r\nevident.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. We found it in the pocket of his coat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes\u2014\u201d He hesitated, throwing the merest fraction of a glance towards\r\nhis mother. The magistrate understood.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs yet\u2014no. Can you give us any clue as to the writer?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no idea whatsoever.\u201d\r\n\r\nM. Hautet sighed.\r\n\r\n\u201cA most mysterious case. Ah, well, I suppose we can now rule out the\r\nletter altogether. What do you think, M. Giraud? It does not seem to\r\nlead us anywhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt certainly does not,\u201d agreed the detective with emphasis.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d sighed the magistrate, \u201cit promised at the beginning to be\r\nsuch a beautiful and simple case!\u201d He caught Mrs. Renauld\u2019s eye, and\r\nblushed in immediate confusion. \u201cAh, yes,\u201d he coughed, turning over the\r\npapers on the table. \u201cLet me see, where were we? Oh, the weapon. I fear\r\nthis may give you pain, M. Renauld. I understand it was a present from\r\nyou to your mother. Very sad\u2014very distressing\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nJack Renauld leaned forward. His face, which had flushed during the\r\nperusal of the letter, was now deadly white.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean\u2014that it was with an aeroplane wire paper cutter that my\r\nfather was\u2014was killed? But it\u2019s impossible! A little thing like that!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlas, M. Renauld, it is only too true! An ideal little tool, I fear.\r\nSharp and easy to handle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is it? Can I see it? Is it still in the\u2014the body?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, it had been removed. You would like to see it? To make sure?\r\nIt would be as well, perhaps, though madame has already identified it.\r\nStill\u2014M. Bex, might I trouble you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, M. le juge. I will fetch it immediately.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould it not be better to take M. Renauld to the shed?\u201d suggested\r\nGiraud smoothly. \u201cWithout doubt he would wish to see his father\u2019s\r\nbody.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boy made a shivering gesture of negation, and the magistrate,\r\nalways disposed to cross Giraud whenever possible, replied.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut no\u2014not at present. M. Bex will be so kind as to bring it to us\r\nhere.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe commissary left the room. Stonor crossed to Jack, and wrung him by\r\nthe hand. Poirot had risen and was adjusting a pair of candlesticks\r\nthat struck his trained eye as being a shade askew. The magistrate was\r\nreading the mysterious love-letter through a last time, clinging\r\ndesperately to his first theory of jealousy and a stab in the back.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the door burst open and the commissary rushed in.\r\n\r\n\u201cM. le juge! M. le juge!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut yes. What is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe dagger! It is gone!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Comment___\u2014gone?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVanished. Disappeared. The glass jar that contained it is empty!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I cried. \u201cImpossible. Why, only this morning I saw\u2014\u201d The words\r\ndied on my tongue.\r\n\r\nBut the attention of the entire room was diverted to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is that you say?\u201d cried the commissary. \u201cThis morning?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw it there this morning,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cAbout an hour and a half\r\nago, to be accurate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou went to the shed, then? How did you get the key?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI asked the _sergent de ville___ for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you went there? Why?\u201d\r\n\r\nI hesitated, but in the end I decided that the only thing to do was to\r\nmake a clean breast of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cM. le juge,\u201d I said. \u201cI have committed a grave fault, for which I must\r\ncrave your indulgence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien!___ Proceed, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is,\u201d I said, wishing myself anywhere else than\r\nwhere I was, \u201cthat I met a young lady, an acquaintance of mine. She\r\ndisplayed a great desire to see everything that was to be seen, and\r\nI\u2014well, in short, I took the key to show her the body.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, _par exemple___,\u201d cried the magistrate indignantly. \u201cBut it is a\r\ngrave fault you have committed there, Captain Hastings. It is\r\naltogether most irregular. You should not have permitted yourself this\r\nfolly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said meekly. \u201cNothing that you can say could be too severe,\r\nM. le juge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did not invite this lady to come here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly not. I met her quite by accident. She is an English lady who\r\nhappens to be staying in Merlinville, though I was not aware of that\r\nuntil my unexpected meeting with her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said the magistrate, softening. \u201cIt was most irregular,\r\nbut the lady is without doubt young and beautiful, _n\u2019est-ce pas?___\r\nWhat it is to be young! _O jeunesse, jeunesse!___\u201d And he sighed\r\nsentimentally.\r\n\r\nBut the commissary, less romantic, and more practical, took up the\r\ntale:\r\n\r\n\u201cBut did not you reclose and lock the door when you departed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just it,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s what I blame myself for so\r\nterribly. My friend was upset at the sight. She nearly fainted. I got\r\nher some brandy and water, and afterwards insisted on accompanying her\r\nback to town. In the excitement, I forgot to relock the door. I only\r\ndid so when I got back to the Villa.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen for twenty minutes at least\u2014\u201d said the commissary slowly. He\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n\u201cTwenty minutes,\u201d mused the commissary.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is deplorable,\u201d said M. Hautet, his sternness of manner returning.\r\n\u201cWithout precedent.\u201d\r\n\r\nSuddenly another voice spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou find it deplorable, M. le juge?\u201d asked Giraud.\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly I do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien!___ I find it admirable,\u201d said the other imperturbably.\r\n\r\nThis unexpected ally quite bewildered me.\r\n\r\n\u201cAdmirable, M. Giraud?\u201d asked the magistrate, studying him cautiously\r\nout of the corner of his eye.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause we know now that the assassin, or an accomplice of the\r\nassassin, has been near the Villa only an hour ago. It will be strange\r\nif, with that knowledge, we do not shortly lay hands upon him.\u201d There\r\nwas a note of menace in his voice. He continued: \u201cHe risked a good deal\r\nto gain possession of that dagger. Perhaps he feared that finger-prints\r\nmight be discovered on it.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot turned to Bex.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou said there were none?\u201d\r\n\r\nGiraud shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps he could not be sure.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot looked at him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are wrong, M. Giraud. The assassin wore gloves. So he must have\r\nbeen sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not say it was the assassin himself. It may have been an\r\naccomplice who was not aware of that fact.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Ils sont mal renseign\u00e9s, les accomplices!___\u201d muttered Poirot, but he\r\nsaid no more.\r\n\r\nThe magistrate\u2019s clerk was gathering up the papers on the table. M.\r\nHautet addressed us:\r\n\r\n\u201cOur work here is finished. Perhaps, M. Renauld, you will listen whilst\r\nyour evidence is read over to you. I have purposely kept all the\r\nproceedings as informal as possible. I have been called original in my\r\nmethods, but I maintain that there is much to be said for originality.\r\nThe case is now in the clever hands of the renowned M. Giraud. He will\r\nwithout doubt distinguish himself. Indeed, I wonder that he has not\r\nalready laid his hands upon the murderers! Madame, again let me assure\r\nyou of my heart-felt sympathy. Messieurs, I wish you all good day.\u201d\r\nAnd, accompanied by his clerk and the commissary, he took his\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nPoirot tugged out that large turnip of a watch of his, and observed the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us return to the hotel for lunch, my friend,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\r\nshall recount to me in full the indiscretions of this morning. No one\r\nis observing us. We need make no adieux.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe went quietly out of the room. The examining magistrate had just\r\ndriven off in his car. I was going down the steps when Poirot\u2019s voice\r\narrested me:\r\n\r\n\u201cOne little moment, my friend.\u201d Dexterously, he whipped out his yard\r\nmeasure, and proceeded, quite solemnly, to measure an overcoat hanging\r\nin the hall from the collar to the hem. I had not seen it hanging there\r\nbefore, and guessed that it belonged to either Mr. Stonor, or Jack\r\nRenauld.\r\n\r\nThen, with a little satisfied grunt, Poirot returned the measure to his\r\npocket, and followed me out into the open air.\r\n\n\u201cWhy did you measure that overcoat?\u201d I asked, with some curiosity, as\r\nwe walked down the hot white road at a leisurely pace.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Parbleu!___ to see how long it was,\u201d replied my friend imperturbably.\r\n\r\nI was vexed. Poirot\u2019s incurable habit of making a mystery out of\r\nnothing never failed to irritate me. I relapsed into silence, and\r\nfollowed a train of thought of my own. Although I had not noticed them\r\nspecially at the time, certain words Mrs. Renauld had addressed to her\r\nson now recurred to me, fraught with a new significance. \u201cSo you did\r\nnot sail?\u201d she had said, and then had added: \u201c_After all, it does not\r\nmatter\u2014now.___\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat had she meant by that? The words were enigmatical\u2014significant. Was\r\nit possible that she knew more than we supposed? She had denied all\r\nknowledge of the mysterious mission with which her husband was to have\r\nentrusted his son. But was she really less ignorant than she pretended?\r\nCould she enlighten us if she chose, and was her silence part of a\r\ncarefully thought out and preconceived plan?\r\n\r\nThe more I thought about it, the more I was convinced that I was right.\r\nMrs. Renauld knew more than she chose to tell. In her surprise at\r\nseeing her son, she had momentarily betrayed herself. I felt convinced\r\nthat she knew, if not the assassins, at least the motive for the\r\nassassination. But some very powerful considerations must keep her\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think profoundly, my friend,\u201d remarked Poirot, breaking in upon my\r\nreflections. \u201cWhat is it that intrigues you so?\u201d\r\n\r\nI told him, sure of my ground, though feeling expectant that he would\r\nridicule my suspicions. But to my surprise he nodded thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are quite right, Hastings. From the beginning I have been sure\r\nthat she was keeping something back. At first I suspected her, if not\r\nof inspiring, at least of conniving at the crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou suspected _her?___\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut certainly! She benefits enormously\u2014in fact, by this new will, she\r\nis the only person to benefit. So, from the start, she was singled out\r\nfor attention. You may have noticed that I took an early opportunity of\r\nexamining her wrists. I wished to see whether there was any possibility\r\nthat she had gagged and bound herself. _Eh bien___, I saw at once that\r\nthere was no fake, the cords had actually been drawn so tight as to cut\r\ninto the flesh. That ruled out the possibility of her having committed\r\nthe crime single-handed. But it was still possible for her to have\r\nconnived at it, or to have been the instigator with an accomplice.\r\nMoreover, the story, as she told it, was singularly familiar to me\u2014the\r\nmasked men that she could not recognize, the mention of \u2018the secret\u2019\u2014I\r\nhad heard, or read, all these things before. Another little detail\r\nconfirmed my belief that she was not speaking the truth. _The wrist\r\nwatch, Hastings, the wrist watch!___\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain that wrist watch! Poirot was eyeing me curiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, _mon ami?___ You comprehend?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I replied with some ill humour. \u201cI neither see nor comprehend.\r\nYou make all these confounded mysteries, and it\u2019s useless asking you to\r\nexplain. You always like keeping everything up your sleeve to the last\r\nminute.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not enrage yourself, my friend,\u201d said Poirot with a smile. \u201cI will\r\nexplain if you wish. But not a word to Giraud, _c\u2019est entendu?___ He\r\ntreats me as an old one of no importance! _We shall see!___ In common\r\nfairness I gave him a hint. If he does not choose to act upon it, that\r\nis his own look out.\u201d\r\n\r\nI assured Poirot that he could rely upon my discretion.\r\n\r\n\u201c_C\u2019est bien!___ Let us then employ our little grey cells. Tell me, my\r\nfriend, at what time, according to you, did the tragedy take place?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, at two o\u2019clock or thereabouts,\u201d I said, astonished. \u201cYou\r\nremember, Mrs. Renauld told us that she heard the clock strike while\r\nthe men were in the room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly, and on the strength of that, you, the examining magistrate,\r\nBex, and every one else, accept the time without further question. But\r\nI, Hercule Poirot, say that Madame Renauld lied. _The crime took place\r\nat least two hours earlier.___\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the doctors\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey declared, after examination of the body, that death had taken\r\nplace between ten and seven hours previously. _Mon ami___, for some\r\nreason, it was imperative that the crime should seem to have taken\r\nplace later than it actually did. You have read of a smashed watch or\r\nclock recording the exact hour of a crime? So that the time should not\r\nrest on Mrs. Renauld\u2019s testimony alone, some one moved on the hands of\r\nthat wrist watch to two o\u2019clock, and then dashed it violently to the\r\nground. But, as is often the case, they defeated their own object. The\r\nglass was smashed, but the mechanism of the watch was uninjured. It was\r\na most disastrous manoeuvre on their part, for it at once drew my\r\nattention to two points\u2014first, that Madame Renauld was lying: secondly,\r\nthat there must be some vital reason for the postponement of the time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what reason could there be?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that is the question! There we have the whole mystery. As yet, I\r\ncannot explain it. There is only one idea that presents itself to me as\r\nhaving a possible connection.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that is?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe last train left Merlinville at seventeen minutes past twelve.\u201d\r\n\r\nI followed it out slowly.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo that, the crime apparently taking place some two hours later, any\r\none leaving by that train would have an unimpeachable alibi!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerfect, Hastings! You have it!\u201d\r\n\r\nI sprang up.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut we must inquire at the station. Surely they cannot have failed to\r\nnotice two foreigners who left by that train! We must go there at\r\nonce!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think so, Hastings?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course. Let us go there now.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot restrained my ardour with a light touch upon the arm.\r\n\r\n\u201cGo by all means if you wish, _mon ami___\u2014but if you go, I should not\r\nask for particulars of two foreigners.\u201d\r\n\r\nI stared, and he said rather impatiently:\r\n\r\n\u201cL\u00e0, l\u00e0, you do not believe all that rigmarole, do you? The masked men\r\nand all the rest of _cette histoire-l\u00e0!___\u201d\r\n\r\nHis words took me so much aback that I hardly knew how to respond. He\r\nwent on serenely:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou heard me say to Giraud, did you not, that all the details of this\r\ncrime were familiar to me? _Eh bien___, that presupposes one of two\r\nthings, either the brain that planned the first crime also planned this\r\none, or else an account read of a _cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre___ unconsciously\r\nremained in our assassin\u2019s memory and prompted the details. I shall be\r\nable to pronounce definitely on that after\u2014\u201d he broke off.\r\n\r\nI was revolving sundry matters in my mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut Mr. Renauld\u2019s letter? It distinctly mentions a secret and\r\nSantiago?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUndoubtedly there was a secret in M. Renauld\u2019s life\u2014there can be no\r\ndoubt of that. On the other hand, the word Santiago, to my mind, is a\r\nred herring, dragged continually across the track to put us off the\r\nscent. It is possible that it was used in the same way on M. Renauld,\r\nto keep him from directing his suspicions into a quarter nearer at\r\nhand. Oh, be assured, Hastings, the danger that threatened him was not\r\nin Santiago, it was near at hand, in France.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe spoke so gravely, and with such assurance, that I could not fail to\r\nbe convinced. But I essayed one final objection:\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the match and cigarette end found near the body? What of them.\u201d\r\n\r\nA light of pure enjoyment lit up Poirot\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlanted! Deliberately planted there for Giraud or one of his tribe to\r\nfind! Ah, he is smart, Giraud, he can do his tricks! So can a good\r\nretriever dog. He comes in so pleased with himself. For hours he has\r\ncrawled on his stomach. \u2018See what I have found,\u2019 he says. And then\r\nagain to me: \u2018What do you see here?\u2019 Me, I answer, with profound and\r\ndeep truth, \u2018Nothing.\u2019 And Giraud, the great Giraud, he laughs, he\r\nthinks to himself, \u2018Oh, that he is imbecile, this old one!\u2019 _But we\r\nshall see.\u200a\u2026___\u201d\r\n\r\nBut my mind had reverted to the main facts.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen all this story of the masked men\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs false.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat really happened?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne person could tell us\u2014Madame Renauld. But she will not speak.\r\nThreats and entreaties would not move her. A remarkable woman that,\r\nHastings. I recognized as soon as I saw her that I had to deal with a\r\nwoman of unusual character. At first, as I told you, I was inclined to\r\nsuspect her of being concerned in the crime. Afterwards I altered my\r\nopinion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat made you do that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHer spontaneous and genuine grief at the sight of her husband\u2019s body.\r\nI could swear that the agony in that cry of hers was genuine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said thoughtfully, \u201cone cannot mistake these things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon, my friend\u2014one can always be mistaken. Regard a\r\ngreat actress, does not her acting of grief carry you away and impress\r\nyou with its reality? No, however strong my own impression and belief,\r\nI needed other evidence before I allowed myself to be satisfied. The\r\ngreat criminal can be a great actor. I base my certainty in this case,\r\nnot upon my own impression, but upon the undeniable fact that Mrs.\r\nRenauld actually fainted. I turned up her eyelids and felt her pulse.\r\nThere was no deception\u2014the swoon was genuine. Therefore I was satisfied\r\nthat her anguish was real and not assumed. Besides, a small additional\r\npoint not without interest, it was unnecessary for Mrs. Renauld to\r\nexhibit unrestrained grief. She had had one paroxysm on learning of her\r\nhusband\u2019s death, and there would be no need for her to simulate another\r\nsuch a violent one on beholding his body. No, Mrs. Renauld was not her\r\nhusband\u2019s murderess. But why has she lied? She lied about the wrist\r\nwatch, she lied about the masked men\u2014she lied about a third thing. Tell\r\nme, Hastings, what is your explanation of the open door?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, rather embarrassed, \u201cI suppose it was an oversight.\r\nThey forgot to shut it.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head, and sighed.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is the explanation of Giraud. It does not satisfy me. There is a\r\nmeaning behind that open door which for a moment I cannot fathom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have an idea,\u201d I cried suddenly.\r\n\r\n\u201c_A la bonne heure!___ Let us hear it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cListen. We are agreed that Mrs. Renauld\u2019s story is a fabrication. Is\r\nit not possible, then, that Mr. Renauld left the house to keep an\r\nappointment\u2014possibly with the murderer\u2014leaving the front door open for\r\nhis return. But he did not return, and the next morning he is found,\r\nstabbed in the back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAn admirable theory, Hastings, but for two facts which you have\r\ncharacteristically overlooked. In the first place, who gagged and bound\r\nMadame Renauld? And why on earth should they return to the house to do\r\nso? In the second place, no man on earth would go out to keep an\r\nappointment wearing his underclothes and an overcoat. There are\r\ncircumstances in which a man might wear pajamas and an overcoat\u2014but the\r\nother, never!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue,\u201d I said, rather crest-fallen.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d continued Poirot, \u201cwe must look elsewhere for a solution of the\r\nopen door mystery. One thing I am fairly sure of\u2014they did not leave\r\nthrough the door. They left by the window.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut there were no footmarks in the flower bed underneath.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2014_and there ought to have been.___ Listen, Hastings. The gardener,\r\nAuguste, as you heard him say, planted both those beds the preceding\r\nafternoon. In the one there are plentiful impressions of his big\r\nhobnailed boots\u2014in the other, _none!___ You see? Some one had passed\r\nthat way, some one who, to obliterate their footprints, smoothed over\r\nthe surface of the bed with a rake.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere did they get a rake?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere they got the spade and the gardening gloves,\u201d said Poirot\r\nimpatiently. \u201cThere is no difficulty about that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat makes you think that they left that way, though? Surely it is\r\nmore probable that they entered by the window, and left by the door.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is possible of course. Yet I have a strong idea that they left by\r\nthe window.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think you are wrong.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps, _mon ami___.\u201d\r\n\r\nI mused, thinking over the new field of conjecture that Poirot\u2019s\r\ndeductions had opened up to me. I recalled my wonder at his cryptic\r\nallusions to the flower bed and the wrist watch. His remarks had seemed\r\nso meaningless at the moment and now, for the first time, I realized\r\nhow remarkably, from a few slight incidents, he had unravelled much of\r\nthe mystery that surrounded the case. I paid a belated homage to my\r\nfriend. As though he read my thoughts, he nodded sagely.\r\n\r\n\u201cMethod, you comprehend! Method! Arrange your facts. Arrange your\r\nideas. And if some little fact will not fit in\u2014do not reject it but\r\nconsider it closely. Though its significance escapes you, be sure that\r\nit is significant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the meantime,\u201d I said, considering, \u201calthough we know a great deal\r\nmore than we did, we are no nearer to solving the mystery of who killed\r\nMr. Renauld.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Poirot cheerfully. \u201cIn fact we are a great deal further\r\noff.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe fact seemed to afford him such peculiar satisfaction that I gazed\r\nat him in wonder. He met my eye and smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut yes, it is better so. Before, there was at all events a clear\r\ntheory as to how and by whose hands he met his death. Now that is all\r\ngone. We are in darkness. A hundred conflicting points confuse and\r\nworry us. That is well. That is excellent. Out of confusion comes forth\r\norder. But if you find order to start with, if a crime seems simple and\r\nabove-board, _eh bien, m\u00e9fiez vous!___ It is, how do you say\r\nit?\u2014_cooked!___ The great criminal is simple\u2014but very few criminals\r\n_are___ great. In trying to cover up their tracks, they invariably\r\nbetray themselves. Ah, _mon ami___, I would that some day I could meet\r\na really great criminal\u2014one who commits his crime, and then\u2014does\r\nnothing! Even I, Hercule Poirot, might fail to catch such a one.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut I had not followed his words. A light had burst upon me.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot! Mrs. Renauld! I see it now. She must be shielding somebody.\u201d\r\n\r\nFrom the quietness with which Poirot received my remark, I could see\r\nthat the idea had already occurred to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cShielding some one\u2014or screening some one.\r\nOne of the two.\u201d\r\n\r\nI saw very little difference between the two words, but I developed my\r\ntheme with a good deal of earnestness. Poirot maintained a strictly\r\nnon-committal attitude, repeating:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may be\u2014yes, it may be. But as yet I do not know! There is something\r\nvery deep underneath all this. You will see. Something very deep.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen, as we entered our hotel, he enjoined silence on me with a\r\ngesture.\r\n\nWe lunched with an excellent appetite. I understood well enough that\r\nPoirot did not wish to discuss the tragedy where we could so easily be\r\noverheard. But, as is usual when one topic fills the mind to the\r\nexclusion of everything else, no other subject of interest seemed to\r\npresent itself. For a while we ate in silence, and then Poirot observed\r\nmaliciously:\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien!___ And your indiscretions! You recount them not?\u201d\r\n\r\nI felt myself blushing.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you mean this morning?\u201d I endeavoured to adopt a tone of absolute\r\nnonchalance.\r\n\r\nBut I was no match for Poirot. In a very few minutes he had extracted\r\nthe whole story from me, his eyes twinkling as he did so.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Tiens!___ A story of the most romantic. What is her name, this\r\ncharming young lady?\u201d\r\n\r\nI had to confess that I did not know.\r\n\r\n\u201cStill more romantic! The first _rencontre___ in the train from Paris,\r\nthe second here. Journeys end in lovers\u2019 meetings, is not that the\r\nsaying?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be an ass, Poirot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYesterday it was Mademoiselle Daubreuil, today it is\r\nMademoiselle\u2014Cinderella! Decidedly you have the heart of a Turk,\r\nHastings! You should establish a harem!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very well to rag me. Mademoiselle Daubreuil is a very\r\nbeautiful girl, and I do admire her immensely\u2014I don\u2019t mind admitting\r\nit. The other\u2019s nothing\u2014don\u2019t suppose I shall ever see her again. She\r\nwas quite amusing to talk to just for a railway journey, but she\u2019s not\r\nthe kind of girl I should ever get keen on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell\u2014it sounds snobbish perhaps\u2014but she\u2019s not a lady, not in any sense\r\nof the word.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully. There was less raillery in his voice as he\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou believe, then, in birth and breeding?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI may be old-fashioned, but I certainly don\u2019t believe in marrying out\r\nof one\u2019s class. It never answers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI agree with you, _mon ami___. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, it\r\nis as you say. But there is always the hundredth time! Still, that does\r\nnot arise, as you do not propose to see the lady again.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis last words were almost a question, and I was aware of the sharpness\r\nwith which he darted a glance at me. And before my eyes, writ large in\r\nletters of fire, I saw the words \u201cH\u00f4tel du Phare,\u201d and I heard again\r\nher voice saying \u201cCome and look me up\u201d and my own answering with\r\n_empressement___: \u201cI will.\u201d\r\n\r\nWell, what of it? I had meant to go at the time. But since then, I had\r\nhad time to reflect. I did not like the girl. Thinking it over in cold\r\nblood, I came definitely to the conclusion that I disliked her\r\nintensely. I had got hauled over the coals for foolishly gratifying her\r\nmorbid curiosity, and I had not the least wish to see her again.\r\n\r\nI answered Poirot lightly enough.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe asked me to look her up, but of course I shan\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy \u2018of course\u2019?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell\u2014I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d He studied me attentively for some minutes. \u201cYes. I see very\r\nwell. And you are wise. Stick to what you have said.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat seems to be your invariable advice,\u201d I remarked, rather piqued.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, my friend, have faith in Papa Poirot. Some day, if you permit, I\r\nwill arrange you a marriage of great suitability.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said laughing, \u201cbut the prospect leaves me cold.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot sighed and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Les Anglais!___\u201d he murmured. \u201cNo method\u2014absolutely none whatever.\r\nThey leave all to chance!\u201d He frowned, and altered the position of the\r\nsalt cellar.\r\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle Cinderella is staying at the H\u00f4tel d\u2019Angleterre you told\r\nme, did you not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. H\u00f4tel du Phare.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue, I forgot.\u201d\r\n\r\nA moment\u2019s misgiving shot across my mind. Surely I had never mentioned\r\nany hotel to Poirot. I looked across at him, and felt reassured. He was\r\ncutting his bread into neat little squares, completely absorbed in his\r\ntask. He must have fancied I had told him where the girl was staying.\r\n\r\nWe had coffee outside facing the sea. Poirot smoked one of his tiny\r\ncigarettes, and then drew his watch from his pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe train to Paris leaves at 2:25,\u201d he observed. \u201cI should be\r\nstarting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cParis?\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is what I said, _mon ami___.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are going to Paris? But why?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe replied very seriously.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo look for the murderer of M. Renauld.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think he is in Paris?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am quite certain that he is not. Nevertheless, it is there that I\r\nmust look for him. You do not understand, but I will explain it all to\r\nyou in good time. Believe me, this journey to Paris is necessary. I\r\nshall not be away long. In all probability I shall return tomorrow. I\r\ndo not propose that you should accompany me. Remain here and keep an\r\neye on Giraud. Also cultivate the society of M. Renauld _fils___. And\r\nthirdly, if you wish, endeavour to cut him out with Mademoiselle\r\nMarthe. But I fear you will not have great success.\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not quite relish the last remark.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat reminds me,\u201d I said. \u201cI meant to ask you how you knew about those\r\ntwo?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon ami___\u2014I know human nature. Throw together a boy young Renauld\r\nand a beautiful girl like Mademoiselle Marthe, and the result is almost\r\ninevitable. Then, the quarrel! It was money or a woman and, remembering\r\nL\u00e9onie\u2019s description of the lad\u2019s anger, I decided on the latter. So I\r\nmade my guess\u2014and I was right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that was why you warned me against setting my heart on the lady?\r\nYou already suspected that she loved young Renauld?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt any rate\u2014_I saw that she had anxious eyes.___ That is how always\r\nthink of Mademoiselle Daubreuil _as the girl with the anxious\r\neyes.\u200a\u2026___\u201d\r\n\r\nHis voice was so grave that it impressed me uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that, Poirot?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fancy, my friend, that we shall see before very long. But I must\r\nstart.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve oceans of time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps\u2014perhaps. But I like plenty of leisure at the station. I do not\r\nwish to rush, to hurry, to excite myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt all events,\u201d I said, rising, \u201cI will come and see you off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will do nothing of the sort. I forbid it.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was so peremptory that I stared at him in surprise. He nodded\r\nemphatically.\r\n\r\n\u201cI mean it, _mon ami___. Au revoir! You permit that I embrace you? Ah,\r\nno, I forget that it is not the English custom. Une poignee de main,\r\nalors.\u201d\r\n\r\nI felt rather at a loose end after Poirot had left me. I strolled down\r\nthe beach, and watched the bathers, without feeling energetic enough to\r\njoin them. I rather fancied that Cinderella might be disporting herself\r\namongst them in some wonderful costume, but I saw no signs of her. I\r\nstrolled aimlessly along the sands towards the further end of the town.\r\nIt occurred to me that, after all, it would only be decent feeling on\r\nmy part to inquire after the girl. And it would save trouble in the\r\nend. The matter would then be finished with. There would be no need for\r\nme to trouble about her any further. But, if I did not go at all, she\r\nmight quite possibly come and look me up at the Villa. And that would\r\nbe annoying in every way. Decidedly it would be better to pay a short\r\ncall, in the course of which I could make it quite clear that I could\r\ndo nothing further for her in my capacity of showman.\r\n\r\nAccordingly I left the beach, and walked inland. I soon found the H\u00f4tel\r\ndu Phare, a very unpretentious building. It was annoying in the extreme\r\nnot to know the lady\u2019s name and, to save my dignity, I decided to\r\nstroll inside and look around. Probably I should find her in the\r\nlounge. Merlinville was a small place, you left your hotel to go to the\r\nbeach, and you left the beach to return to the hotel. There were no\r\nother attractions. There was a Casino being built, but it was not yet\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nI had walked the length of the beach without seeing her, therefore she\r\nmust be in the hotel. I went in. Several people were sitting in the\r\ntiny lounge, but my quarry was not amongst them. I looked into some\r\nother rooms, but there was no sign of her. I waited for some time, till\r\nmy impatience got the better of me. I took the concierge aside, and\r\nslipped five francs into his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish to see a lady who is staying here. A young English lady, small\r\nand dark. I am not sure of her name.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man shook his head, and seemed to be suppressing a grin.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no such lady as you describe staying here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is American possibly,\u201d I suggested. These fellows are so stupid.\r\n\r\nBut the man continued to shake his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, monsieur. There are only six or seven English and American ladies\r\naltogether, and they are all much older than the lady you are seeking.\r\nIt is not here that you will find her, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was so positive that I felt doubts.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the lady told me she was staying here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur must have made a mistake\u2014or it is more likely the lady did,\r\nsince there has been another gentleman here inquiring for her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is that you say?\u201d I cried, surprised.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut yes, monsieur. A gentleman who described her just as you have\r\ndone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat was he like?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was a small gentleman, well dressed, very neat, very spotless, the\r\nmoustache very stiff, the head of a peculiar shape, and the eyes\r\ngreen.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot! So that was why he refused to let me accompany him to the\r\nstation. The impertinence of it! I would thank him not to meddle in my\r\nconcerns. Did he fancy I needed a nurse to look after me? Thanking the\r\nman, I departed, somewhat at a loss, and still much incensed with my\r\nmeddlesome friend. I regretted that he was, for the moment, out of\r\nreach. I should have enjoyed telling him what I thought of his\r\nunwarranted interference. Had I not distinctly told him that I had no\r\nintention of seeing the girl? Decidedly, one\u2019s friends can be too\r\nzealous!\r\n\r\nBut where was the lady? I set aside my wrath, and tried to puzzle it\r\nout. Evidently, through inadvertence, she had named the wrong hotel.\r\nThen another thought struck me. Was it inadvertence? Or had she\r\ndeliberately withheld her name and given me the wrong address? The more\r\nI thought about it, the more I felt convinced that this last surmise of\r\nmine was right. For some reason or other she did not wish to let the\r\nacquaintance ripen into friendship. And though half an hour earlier\r\nthis had been precisely my own view, I did not enjoy having the tables\r\nturned upon me. The whole affair was profoundly unsatisfactory, and I\r\nwent up to the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve in a condition of distinct ill humour. I\r\ndid not go to the house, but went up the path to the little bench by\r\nthe shed, and sat there moodily enough.\r\n\r\nI was distracted from my thoughts by the sound of voices close at hand.\r\nIn a second or two I realized that they came, not from the garden I was\r\nin, but from the adjoining garden of the Villa Marguerite, and that\r\nthey were approaching rapidly. A girl\u2019s voice was speaking, a voice\r\nthat I recognized as that of the beautiful Marthe.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Ch\u00e9ri___,\u201d she was saying, \u201cis it really true? Are all our troubles\r\nover.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know it, Marthe,\u201d Jack Renauld replied. \u201cNothing can part us now,\r\nbeloved. The last obstacle to our union is removed. Nothing can take\r\nyou from me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing?\u201d the girl murmured. \u201cOh, Jack, Jack\u2014I am afraid.\u201d\r\n\r\nI had moved to depart, realizing that I was quite unintentionally\r\neavesdropping. As I rose to my feet, I caught sight of them through a\r\ngap in the hedge. They stood together facing me, the man\u2019s arm round\r\nthe girl, his eyes looking into hers. They were a splendid looking\r\ncouple, the dark, well-knit boy, and the fair young goddess. They\r\nseemed made for each other as they stood there, happy in spite of the\r\nterrible tragedy that overshadowed their young lives.\r\n\r\nBut the girl\u2019s face was troubled, and Jack Renauld seemed to recognize\r\nit, as he held her closer to him and asked:\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what are you afraid of, darling? What is there to fear\u2014now?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd then I saw the look in her eyes, the look Poirot had spoken of, as\r\nshe murmured, so that I almost guessed at the words.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am afraid\u2014for _you___.\u200a\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not hear young Renauld\u2019s answer, for my attention was distracted\r\nby an unusual appearance a little further down the hedge. There\r\nappeared to be a brown bush there, which seemed odd, to say the least\r\nof it, so early in the summer. I stepped along to investigate, but, at\r\nmy advance, the brown bush withdrew itself precipitately, and faced me\r\nwith a finger to its lips. It was Giraud.\r\n\r\nEnjoining caution, he led the way round the shed until we were out of\r\near-shot.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat were you doing there?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly what you were doing\u2014listening.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I was not there on purpose!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Giraud. \u201cI was.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs always, I admired the man whilst disliking him. He looked me up and\r\ndown with a sort of contemptuous disfavour.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t help matters by butting in. I might have heard something\r\nuseful in a minute. What have you done with your old fossil?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cM. Poirot has gone to Paris,\u201d I replied coldly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I can tell you, M. Giraud, that he is anything but an old fossil.\r\nHe has solved many cases that have completely baffled the English\r\npolice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBah! The English police!\u201d Giraud snapped his fingers disdainfully.\r\n\u201cThey must be on a level with our examining magistrates. So he has gone\r\nto Paris, has he? Well, a good thing. The longer he stays there, the\r\nbetter. But what does he think he will find there?\u201d\r\n\r\nI thought I read in the question a tinge of uneasiness. I drew myself\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat I am not at liberty to say,\u201d I said quietly.\r\n\r\nGiraud subjected me to a piercing stare.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has probably enough sense not to tell _you___,\u201d he remarked rudely.\r\n\u201cGood afternoon. I\u2019m busy.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd with that, he turned on his heel, and left me without ceremony.\r\nMatters seemed at a standstill at the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve. Giraud evidently\r\ndid not desire my company and, from what I had seen, it seemed fairly\r\ncertain that Jack Renauld did not either.\r\n\r\nI went back to the town, had an enjoyable bath and returned to the\r\nhotel. I turned in early, wondering whether the following day would\r\nbring forth anything of interest.\r\n\r\nI was wholly unprepared for what it did bring forth. I was eating my\r\npetit d\u00e9jeuner in the dining-room, when the waiter, who had been\r\ntalking to some one outside, came back in obvious excitement. He\r\nhesitated for a minute, fidgeting with his napkin, and then burst out.\r\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur will pardon me, but he is connected, is he not, with the\r\naffair at the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said eagerly. \u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur has not heard the news, though?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat news?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat there has been another murder there last night!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_What?___\u201d\r\n\r\nLeaving my breakfast, I caught up my hat and ran as fast as I could.\r\nAnother murder\u2014and Poirot away! What fatality. But who had been\r\nmurdered?\r\n\r\nI dashed in at the gate. A group of the servants was in the drive,\r\ntalking and gesticulating. I caught hold of Fran\u00e7oise.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat has happened?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, monsieur! monsieur! Another death! It is terrible. There is a\r\ncurse upon the house. But yes, I say it, a curse! They should send for\r\nM. le cur\u00e9 to bring some holy water. Never will I sleep another night\r\nunder that roof. It might be my turn, who knows?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe crossed herself.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I cried, \u201cbut who has been killed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo I know\u2014me? A man\u2014a stranger. They found him up there\u2014in the\r\nshed\u2014not a hundred yards from where they found poor Monsieur. And that\r\nis not all. He is stabbed\u2014stabbed to the heart _with the same\r\ndagger!___\u201d\r\n\nWaiting for no more, I turned and ran up the path to the shed. The two\r\nmen on guard there stood aside to let me pass and, filled with\r\nexcitement, I entered.\r\n\r\nThe light was dim, the place was a mere rough wooden erection to keep\r\nold pots and tools in. I had entered impetuously, but on the threshold\r\nI checked myself, fascinated by the spectacle before me.\r\n\r\nGiraud was on his hands and knees, a pocket torch in his hand with\r\nwhich he was examining every inch of the ground. He looked up with a\r\nfrown at my entrance, then his face relaxed a little in a sort of\r\ngood-humoured contempt.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, _c\u2019est l\u2019Anglais!___ Enter then. Let us see what you can make of\r\nthis affair.\u201d\r\n\r\nRather stung by his tone, I stooped my head, and passed in.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere he is,\u201d said Giraud, flashing his torch to the far corner.\r\n\r\nI stepped across.\r\n\r\nThe dead man lay straight upon his back. He was of medium height,\r\nswarthy of complexion, and possibly about fifty years of age. He was\r\nneatly dressed in a dark blue suit, well cut and probably made by an\r\nexpensive tailor, but not new. His face was terribly convulsed, and on\r\nhis left side, just over the heart, the hilt of a dagger stood up,\r\nblack and shining. I recognized it. It was the same dagger I had seen\r\nreposing in the glass jar the preceding morning!\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m expecting the doctor any minute,\u201d explained Giraud. \u201cAlthough we\r\nhardly need him. There\u2019s no doubt what the man died of. He was stabbed\r\nto the heart, and death must have been pretty well instantaneous.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen was it done? Last night?\u201d\r\n\r\nGiraud shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cHardly. I don\u2019t lay down the law on medical evidence, but the man\u2019s\r\nbeen dead well over twelve hours. When do you say you last saw that\r\ndagger?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout ten o\u2019clock yesterday morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I should be inclined to fix the crime as being done not long\r\nafter that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut people were passing and repassing this shed continually.\u201d\r\n\r\nGiraud laughed disagreeably.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou progress to a marvel! Who told you he was killed in this shed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell\u2014\u201d I felt flustered. \u201cI\u2014I assumed it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, what a fine detective! Look at him, _mon petit___\u2014does a man\r\nstabbed to the heart fall like that\u2014neatly with his feet together, and\r\nhis arms to his side? No. Again does a man lie down on his back and\r\npermit himself to be stabbed without raising a hand to defend himself?\r\nIt is absurd, is it not? But see here\u2014and here\u2014\u201d He flashed the torch\r\nalong the ground. I saw curious irregular marks in the soft dirt. \u201cHe\r\nwas dragged here after he was dead. Half dragged, half carried by two\r\npeople. Their tracks do not show on the hard ground outside, and here\r\nthey have been careful to obliterate them\u2014but one of the two was a\r\nwoman, my young friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA woman?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut if the tracks are obliterated, how do you know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause, blurred as they are, the prints of the woman\u2019s shoe are\r\nunmistakable. Also, by _this___\u2014\u201d And, leaning forward, he drew\r\nsomething from the handle of the dagger and held it up for me to see.\r\nIt was a woman\u2019s long black hair\u2014similar to the one Poirot had taken\r\nfrom the arm-chair in the library.\r\n\r\nWith a slightly ironic smile he wound it round the dagger again.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will leave things as they are as much as possible,\u201d he explained.\r\n\u201cIt pleases the examining magistrate. _Eh bien___, do you notice\r\nanything else?\u201d\r\n\r\nI was forced to shake my head.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook at his hands.\u201d\r\n\r\nI did. The nails were broken and discoloured, and the skin was hard. It\r\nhardly enlightened me as much as I should have liked it to have done. I\r\nlooked up at Giraud.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are not the hands of a gentleman,\u201d he said, answering my look.\r\n\u201cOn the contrary his clothes are those of a well-to-do man. That is\r\ncurious, is it not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery curious,\u201d I agreed.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd none of his clothing is marked. What do we learn from that? This\r\nman was trying to pass himself off as other than he was. He was\r\nmasquerading. Why? Did he fear something? Was he trying to escape by\r\ndisguising himself? As yet we do not know, but one thing we do know\u2014he\r\nwas as anxious to conceal his identity as we are to discover it.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked down at the body again.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs before there are no finger-prints on the handle of the dagger. The\r\nmurderer again wore gloves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think, then, that the murderer was the same in both cases?\u201d I\r\nasked eagerly.\r\n\r\nGiraud became inscrutable.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind what I think. We shall see. Marchaud!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe _sergent de ville___ appeared at the doorway.\r\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy is Madame Renauld not here? I sent for her a quarter of an hour\r\nago?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is coming up the path now, monsieur, and her son with her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood. I only want one at a time, though.\u201d\r\n\r\nMarchaud saluted and disappeared again. A moment later he reappeared\r\nwith Mrs. Renauld.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is Madame.\u201d\r\n\r\nGiraud came forward with a curt bow.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis way, madame.\u201d He led her across, and then, standing suddenly\r\naside. \u201cHere is the man. Do you know him?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd as he spoke, his eyes, gimlet-like, bored into her face, seeking to\r\nread her mind, noting every indication of her manner.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Renauld remained perfectly calm\u2014too calm, I felt. She looked\r\ndown at the corpse almost without interest, certainly without any sign\r\nof agitation or recognition.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI have never seen him in my life. He is quite a\r\nstranger to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are sure?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do not recognize in him one of your assailants, for instance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she seemed to hesitate, as though struck by the idea. \u201cNo, I do\r\nnot think so. Of course they wore beards\u2014false ones the examining\r\nmagistrate thought, but still\u2014no.\u201d Now she seemed to make her mind up\r\ndefinitely. \u201cI am sure neither of the two was this man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, madame. That is all, then.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stepped out with head erect, the sun flashing on the silver threads\r\nin her hair. Jack Renauld succeeded her. He, too, failed to identify\r\nthe man, in a completely natural manner.\r\n\r\nGiraud merely grunted. Whether he was pleased or chagrined I could not\r\ntell. He merely called to Marchaud:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have got the other there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBring her in then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe other\u201d was Madame Daubreuil. She came indignantly, protesting with\r\nvehemence.\r\n\r\n\u201cI object, monsieur! This is an outrage! What have I to do with all\r\nthis?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame,\u201d said Giraud brutally, \u201cI am investigating not one murder, but\r\ntwo murders! For all I know you may have committed them both.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow dare you?\u201d she cried. \u201cHow dare you insult me by such a wild\r\naccusation! It is infamous.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cInfamous, is it? What about this?\u201d Stooping, he again detached the\r\nhair, and held it up. \u201cDo you see this, madame?\u201d He advanced towards\r\nher. \u201cYou permit that I see whether it matches?\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a cry she started backwards, white to the lips.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is false\u2014I swear it. I know nothing of the crime\u2014of either crime.\r\nAny one who says I do lies! Ah! _mon Dieu___, what shall I do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCalm yourself, madame,\u201d said Giraud coldly. \u201cNo one has accused you as\r\nyet. But you will do well to answer my questions without more ado.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnything you wish, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLook at the dead man. Have you ever seen him before?\u201d\r\n\r\nDrawing nearer, a little of the colour creeping back to her face,\r\nMadame Daubreuil looked down at the victim with a certain amount of\r\ninterest and curiosity. Then she shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know him.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt seemed impossible to doubt her, the words came so naturally. Giraud\r\ndismissed her with a nod of the head. \u201cYou are letting her go?\u201d I asked\r\nin a low voice. \u201cIs that wise? Surely that black hair is from her\r\nhead.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not need teaching my business,\u201d said Giraud dryly. \u201cShe is under\r\nsurveillance. I have no wish to arrest her as yet.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen, frowning, he gazed down at the body.\r\n\r\n\u201cShould you say that was a Spanish type at all?\u201d he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\nI considered the face carefully.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said at last. \u201cI should put him down as a Frenchman most\r\ndecidedly.\u201d\r\n\r\nGiraud gave a grunt of dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\u201cSame here.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stood there for a moment, then with an imperative gesture he waved\r\nme aside, and once more, on hands and knees, he continued his search of\r\nthe floor of the shed. He was marvellous. Nothing escaped him. Inch by\r\ninch he went over the floor, turning over pots, examining old sacks. He\r\npounced on a bundle by the door, but it proved to be only a ragged coat\r\nand trousers, and he flung it down again with a snarl. Two pairs of old\r\ngloves interested him, but in the end he shook his head and laid them\r\naside. Then he went back to the pots, methodically turning them over\r\none by one. In the end, he rose to his feet, and shook his head\r\nthoughtfully. He seemed baffled and perplexed. I think he had forgotten\r\nmy presence.\r\n\r\nBut, at that moment, a stir and bustle was heard outside, and our old\r\nfriend, the examining magistrate, accompanied by his clerk and M. Bex,\r\nwith the doctor behind him, came bustling in.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut this is extraordinary, Mr. Giraud,\u201d cried M. Hautet. \u201cAnother\r\ncrime! Ah, we have not got to the bottom of this case. There is some\r\ndeep mystery here. But who is the victim this time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is just what nobody can tell us, M. le juge. He has not been\r\nidentified.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is the body?\u201d asked the doctor.\r\n\r\nGiraud moved aside a little.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere in the corner. He has been stabbed to the heart, as you see. And\r\nwith the dagger that was stolen yesterday morning. I fancy that the\r\nmurder followed hard upon the theft\u2014but that is for you to say. You can\r\nhandle the dagger freely\u2014there are no finger-prints on it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctor knelt down by the dead man, and Giraud turned to the\r\nexamining magistrate.\r\n\r\n\u201cA pretty little problem, is it not? But I shall solve it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so no one can identify him,\u201d mused the magistrate. \u201cCould it\r\npossibly be one of the assassins? They may have fallen out among\r\nthemselves.\u201d\r\n\r\nGiraud shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe man is a Frenchman\u2014I would take my oath of that\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nBut at that moment they were interrupted by the doctor who was sitting\r\nback on his heels with a perplexed expression.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou say he was killed yesterday morning?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI fix it by the theft of the dagger,\u201d explained Giraud. \u201cHe may, of\r\ncourse, have been killed later in the day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLater in the day? Fiddlesticks! This man has been dead at least\r\nforty-eight hours, and probably longer.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe stared at each other in blank amazement.\r\n\nThe doctor\u2019s words were so surprising that we were all momentarily\r\ntaken aback. Here was a man stabbed with a dagger which we knew to have\r\nbeen stolen only twenty-four hours previously, and yet Dr. Durand\r\nasserted positively that he had been dead at least forty-eight hours!\r\nThe whole thing was fantastic to the last extreme.\r\n\r\nWe were still recovering from the surprise of the doctor\u2019s\r\nannouncement, when a telegram was brought to me. It had been sent up\r\nfrom the hotel to the Villa. I tore it open. It was from Poirot, and\r\nannounced his return by the train arriving at Merlinville at 12:28.\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch and saw that I had just time to get comfortably to\r\nthe station and meet him there. I felt that it was of the utmost\r\nimportance that he should know at once of the new and startling\r\ndevelopments in the case.\r\n\r\nEvidently, I reflected, Poirot had had no difficulty in finding what he\r\nwanted in Paris. The quickness of his return proved that. Very few\r\nhours had sufficed. I wondered how he would take the exciting news I\r\nhad to impart.\r\n\r\nThe train was some minutes late, and I strolled aimlessly up and down\r\nthe platform, until it occurred to me that I might pass the time by\r\nasking a few questions as to who had left Merlinville by the last train\r\non the evening of the tragedy.\r\n\r\nI approached the chief porter, an intelligent looking man, and had\r\nlittle difficulty in persuading him to enter upon the subject. It was a\r\ndisgrace to the Police, he hotly affirmed, that such brigands of\r\nassassins should be allowed to go about unpunished. I hinted that there\r\nwas some possibility they might have left by the midnight train, but he\r\nnegatived the idea decidedly. He would have noticed two foreigners\u2014he\r\nwas sure of it. Only about twenty people had left by the train, and he\r\ncould not have failed to observe them.\r\n\r\nI do not know what put the idea into my head\u2014possibly it was the deep\r\nanxiety underlying Marthe Daubreuil\u2019s tones\u2014but I asked suddenly:\r\n\r\n\u201cYoung M. Renauld\u2014he did not leave by that train, did he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, no, monsieur. To arrive and start off again within half an hour,\r\nit would not be amusing, that!\u201d\r\n\r\nI stared at the man, the significance of his words almost escaping me.\r\nThen I saw.\u200a\u2026\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean,\u201d I said, my heart beating a little, \u201cthat M. Jack Renauld\r\narrived at Merlinville that evening?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut yes, monsieur. By the last train arriving the other way, the\r\n11:40.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy brain whirled. That, then, was the reason of Marthe\u2019s poignant\r\nanxiety. Jack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the\r\ncrime! But why had he not said so? Why, on the contrary, had he led us\r\nto believe that he had remained in Cherbourg? Remembering his frank\r\nboyish countenance, I could hardly bring myself to believe that he had\r\nany connection with the crime. Yet why this silence on his part about\r\nso vital a matter? One thing was certain, Marthe had known all along.\r\nHence her anxiety, and her eager questioning of Poirot to know whether\r\nany one were suspected.\r\n\r\nMy cogitations were interrupted by the arrival of the train, and in\r\nanother moment I was greeting Poirot. The little man was radiant. He\r\nbeamed and vociferated and, forgetting my English reluctance, embraced\r\nme warmly on the platform.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon cher ami___, I have succeeded\u2014but succeeded to a marvel!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed? I\u2019m delighted to hear it. Have you heard the latest here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow would you that I should hear anything? There have been some\r\ndevelopments, eh? The brave Giraud, he has made an arrest? Or even\r\narrests perhaps? Ah, but I will make him look foolish, that one! But\r\nwhere are you taking me, my friend? Do we not go to the hotel? It is\r\nnecessary that I attend to my moustaches\u2014they are deplorably limp from\r\nthe heat of travelling. Also, without doubt, there is dust on my coat.\r\nAnd my tie, that I must rearrange.\u201d\r\n\r\nI cut short his remonstrances.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Poirot\u2014never mind all that. We must go to the Villa at once.\r\n_There has been another murder!___\u201d\r\n\r\nI have frequently been disappointed when fancying that I was giving\r\nnews of importance to my friend. Either he has known it already or he\r\nhas dismissed it as irrelevant to the main issue\u2014and in the latter case\r\nevents have usually proved him justified. But this time I could not\r\ncomplain of missing my effect. Never have I seen a man so\r\nflabbergasted. His jaw dropped. All the jauntiness went out of his\r\nbearing. He stared at me open-mouthed.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is that you say? Another murder? Ah, then, I am all wrong. I have\r\nfailed. Giraud may mock himself at me\u2014he will have reason!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did not expect it, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI? Not the least in the world. It demolishes my theory\u2014it ruins\r\neverything\u2014it\u2014ah, no!\u201d He stopped dead, thumping himself on the chest.\r\n\u201cIt is impossible. I _cannot___ be wrong! The facts, taken methodically\r\nand in their proper order admit of only one explanation. I must be\r\nright! I _am___ right!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut then\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nHe interrupted me.\r\n\r\n\u201cWait, my friend. I must be right, therefore this new murder is\r\nimpossible unless\u2014unless\u2014oh, wait, I implore you. Say no word\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a moment or two, then, resuming his normal manner, he\r\nsaid in a quiet assured voice: \u201cThe victim is a man of middle-age. His\r\nbody was found in the locked shed near the scene of the crime and had\r\nbeen dead at least forty-eight hours. And it is most probable that he\r\nwas stabbed in a similar manner to M. Renauld, though not necessarily\r\nin the back.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was my turn to gape\u2014and gape I did. In all my knowledge of Poirot he\r\nhad never done anything so amazing as this. And, almost inevitably, a\r\ndoubt crossed my mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot,\u201d I cried, \u201cyou\u2019re pulling my leg. You\u2019ve heard all about it\r\nalready.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe turned his earnest gaze upon me reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cWould I do such a thing? I assure you that I have heard nothing\r\nwhatsoever. Did you not observe the shock your news was to me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how on earth could you know all that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was right then? But I knew it. The little grey cells, my friend, the\r\nlittle grey cells! They told me. Thus, and in no other way, could there\r\nhave been a second death. Now tell me all. If we go round to the left\r\nhere, we can take a short cut across the golf links which will bring us\r\nto the back of the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve much more quickly.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs we walked, taking the way he had indicated, I recounted all I knew.\r\nPoirot listened attentively.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe dagger was in the wound, you say? That is curious. You are sure it\r\nwas the same one?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbsolutely certain. That\u2019s what make it so impossible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing is impossible. There may have been two daggers.\u201d\r\n\r\nI raised my eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely that is in the highest degree unlikely? It would be a most\r\nextraordinary coincidence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou speak as usual, without reflection, Hastings. In some cases two\r\nidentical weapons _would___ be highly improbable. But not here. This\r\nparticular weapon was a war souvenir which was made to Jack Renauld\u2019s\r\norders. It is really highly unlikely, when you come to think of it,\r\nthat he should have had only one made. Very probably he would have\r\nanother for his own use.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut nobody has mentioned such a thing,\u201d I objected.\r\n\r\nA hint of the lecturer crept into Poirot\u2019s tone. \u201cMy friend, in working\r\nupon a case, one does not take into account only the things that are\r\n\u2018mentioned.\u2019 There is no reason to mention many things which may be\r\nimportant. Equally, there is often an excellent reason for _not___\r\nmentioning them. You can take your choice of the two motives.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was silent, impressed in spite of myself. Another few minutes brought\r\nus to the famous shed. We found all our friends there and, after an\r\ninterchange of polite amenities, Poirot began his task.\r\n\r\nHaving watched Giraud at work, I was keenly interested. Poirot bestowed\r\nbut a cursory glance on the surroundings. The only thing he examined\r\nwas the ragged coat and trousers by the door. A disdainful smile rose\r\nto Giraud\u2019s lips, and, as though noting it, Poirot flung the bundle\r\ndown again.\r\n\r\n\u201cOld clothes of the gardener\u2019s?\u201d he queried.\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Giraud.\r\n\r\nPoirot knelt down by the body. His fingers were rapid but methodical.\r\nHe examined the texture of the clothes, and satisfied himself that\r\nthere were no marks on them. The boots he subjected to special care,\r\nalso the dirty and broken finger-nails. Whilst examining the latter he\r\nthrew a quick question at Giraud.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou saw these?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I saw them,\u201d replied the other. His face remained inscrutable.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Poirot stiffened.\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Durand!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d The doctor came forward.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is foam on the lips. You observed it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t notice it, I must admit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you observe it now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, certainly.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot again shot a question at Giraud.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou noticed it without doubt?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe other did not reply. Poirot proceeded. The dagger had been\r\nwithdrawn from the wound. It reposed in a glass jar by the side of the\r\nbody. Poirot examined it, then he studied the wound closely. When he\r\nlooked up, his eyes were excited, and shone with the green light I knew\r\nso well.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a strange wound, this! It has not bled. There is no stain on the\r\nclothes. The blade of the dagger is slightly discoloured, that is all.\r\nWhat do you think, M. le docteur?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can only say that it is most abnormal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not abnormal at all. It is most simple. The man was stabbed\r\n_after he was dead___.\u201d And, stilling the clamour of voices that arose\r\nwith a wave of his hand, Poirot turned to Giraud and added, \u201cM. Giraud\r\nagrees with me, do you not, monsieur?\u201d\r\n\r\nWhatever Giraud\u2019s real belief, he accepted the position without moving\r\na muscle. Calmly and almost scornfully he replied:\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly I agree.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe murmur of surprise and interest broke out again.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what an idea!\u201d cried M. Hautet. \u201cTo stab a man after he is dead!\r\nBarbaric! Unheard of! Some unappeasable hate, perhaps.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, M. le juge,\u201d said Poirot. \u201cI should fancy it was done quite\r\ncold-bloodedly\u2014to create an impression.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat impression?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe impression it nearly did create,\u201d returned Poirot oracularly.\r\n\r\nM. Bex had been thinking.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow, then, was the man killed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was not killed. He died. He died, M. le juge, if I am not much\r\nmistaken, of an epileptic fit!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis statement of Poirot\u2019s again aroused considerable excitement. Dr.\r\nDurand knelt down again, and made a searching examination. At last he\r\nrose to his feet.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, M. le docteur?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cM. Poirot, I am inclined to believe that you are correct in your\r\nassertion. I was misled to begin with. The incontrovertible fact that\r\nthe man had been stabbed distracted my attention from any other\r\nindications.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot was the hero of the hour. The examining magistrate was profuse\r\nin compliments. Poirot responded gracefully, and then excused himself\r\non the pretext that neither he nor I had yet lunched, and that he\r\nwished to repair the ravages of the journey. As we were about to leave\r\nthe shed, Giraud approached us.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne more thing, M. Poirot,\u201d he said, in his suave mocking voice. \u201cWe\r\nfound this coiled round the handle of the dagger. A woman\u2019s hair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Poirot. \u201cA woman\u2019s hair? What woman\u2019s, I wonder?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder also,\u201d said Giraud. Then, with a bow, he left us.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was insistent, the good Giraud,\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully, as we\r\nwalked towards the hotel. \u201cI wonder in what direction he hopes to\r\nmislead me? A woman\u2019s hair\u2014h\u2019m!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe lunched heartily, but I found Poirot somewhat distrait and\r\ninattentive. Afterwards we went up to our sitting-room and there I\r\nbegged him to tell me something of his mysterious journey to Paris.\r\n\r\n\u201cWillingly, my friend. I went to Paris to find _this___.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe took from his pocket a small faded newspaper cutting. It was the\r\nreproduction of a woman\u2019s photograph. He handed it to me. I uttered an\r\nexclamation.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou recognize it, my friend?\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded. Although the photo obviously dated from very many years back,\r\nand the hair was dressed in a different style, the likeness was\r\nunmistakable.\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame Daubreuil!\u201d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head with a smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot quite correct, my friend. She did not call herself by that name in\r\nthose days. That is a picture of the notorious Madame Beroldy!\u201d\r\n\r\nMadame Beroldy! In a flash the whole thing came back to me. The murder\r\ntrial that had evoked such world-wide interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Beroldy Case.___\r\n\nSome twenty years or so before the opening of the present story,\r\nMonsieur Arnold Beroldy, a native of Lyons, arrived in Paris\r\naccompanied by his pretty wife and their little daughter, a mere babe.\r\nMonsieur Beroldy was a junior partner in a firm of wine merchants, a\r\nstout middle-aged man, fond of the good things of life, devoted to his\r\ncharming wife, and altogether unremarkable in every way. The firm in\r\nwhich Monsieur Beroldy was a partner was a small one, and although\r\ndoing well, it did not yield a large income to the junior partner. The\r\nBeroldys had a small apartment and lived in a very modest fashion to\r\nbegin with.\r\n\r\nBut unremarkable though Monsieur Beroldy might be, his wife was\r\nplentifully gilded with the brush of Romance. Young and good looking,\r\nand gifted withal with a singular charm of manner, Madame Beroldy at\r\nonce created a stir in the quarter, especially when it began to be\r\nwhispered that some interesting mystery surrounded her birth. It was\r\nrumoured that she was the illegitimate daughter of a Russian Grand\r\nDuke. Others asserted that it was an Austrian Archduke, and that the\r\nunion was legal, though morganatic. But all stories agreed upon one\r\npoint, that Jeanne Beroldy was the centre of an interesting mystery.\r\nQuestioned by the curious, Madame Beroldy did not deny these rumours.\r\nOn the other hand she let it be clearly understood that, though her\r\n\u201clips\u201d were \u201csealed,\u201d all these stories had a foundation in fact. To\r\nintimate friends she unburdened herself further, spoke of political\r\nintrigues, of \u201cpapers,\u201d of obscure dangers that threatened her. There\r\nwas also much talk of Crown jewels that were to be sold secretly, with\r\nherself acting as the go-between.\r\n\r\nAmongst the friends and acquaintances of the Beroldys was a young\r\nlawyer, Georges Conneau. It was soon evident that the fascinating\r\nJeanne had completely enslaved his heart. Madame Beroldy encouraged the\r\nyoung man in a discreet fashion, but being always careful to affirm her\r\ncomplete devotion to her middle-aged husband. Nevertheless, many\r\nspiteful persons did not hesitate to declare that young Conneau was her\r\nlover\u2014and not the only one!\r\n\r\nWhen the Beroldys had been in Paris about three months, another\r\npersonage came upon the scene. This was Mr. Hiram P. Trapp, a native of\r\nthe United States, and extremely wealthy. Introduced to the charming\r\nand mysterious Madame Beroldy, he fell a prompt victim to her\r\nfascinations. His admiration was obvious, though strictly respectful.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, Madame Beroldy became more outspoken in her\r\nconfidences. To several friends, she declared herself greatly worried\r\non her husband\u2019s behalf. She explained that he had been drawn into\r\nseveral schemes of a political nature, and also referred to some\r\nimportant papers that had been entrusted to him for safekeeping and\r\nwhich concerned a \u201csecret\u201d of far reaching European importance. They\r\nhad been entrusted to his custody to throw pursuers off the track, but\r\nMadame Beroldy was nervous, having recognized several important members\r\nof the Revolutionary Circle in Paris.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th day of November, the blow fell. The woman who came daily to\r\nclean and cook for the Beroldys was surprised to find the door of the\r\napartment standing wide open. Hearing faint moans issuing from the\r\nbedroom, she went in. A terrible sight met her eyes. Madame Beroldy lay\r\non the floor, bound hand and foot, uttering feeble moans, having\r\nmanaged to free her mouth from a gag. On the bed was Monsieur Beroldy,\r\nlying in a pool of blood, with a knife driven through his heart.\r\n\r\nMadame Beroldy\u2019s story was clear enough. Suddenly awakened from sleep,\r\nshe had discerned two masked men bending over her. Stifling her cries,\r\nthey had bound and gagged her. They had then demanded of Monsieur\r\nBeroldy the famous \u201csecret.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the intrepid wine merchant refused point-blank to accede to their\r\nrequest. Angered by his refusal, one of the men incontinently stabbed\r\nhim through the heart. With the dead man\u2019s keys, they had opened the\r\nsafe in the corner, and had carried away with them a mass of papers.\r\nBoth men were heavily bearded, and had worn masks, but Madame Beroldy\r\ndeclared positively that they were Russians.\r\n\r\nThe affair created an immense sensation. It was referred to variously\r\nas \u201cthe Nihilist Atrocity,\u201d \u201cRevolutionaries in Paris,\u201d and the\r\n\u201cRussian Mystery.\u201d Time went on, and the mysterious bearded men were\r\nnever traced. And then, just as public interest was beginning to die\r\ndown, a startling development occurred. Madame Beroldy was arrested and\r\ncharged with the murder of her husband.\r\n\r\nThe trial, when it came on, aroused widespread interest. The youth and\r\nbeauty of the accused, and her mysterious history, were sufficient to\r\nmake of it a _cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre___. People ranged themselves wildly for or\r\nagainst the prisoner. But her partisans received several severe checks\r\nto their enthusiasm. The romantic past of Madame Beroldy, her royal\r\nblood, and the mysterious intrigues in which she had her being were\r\nshown to be mere fantasies of the imagination.\r\n\r\nIt was proved beyond doubt that Jeanne Beroldy\u2019s parents were a highly\r\nrespectable and prosaic couple, fruit merchants, who lived on the\r\noutskirts of Lyons. The Russian Grand Duke, the court intrigues, and\r\nthe political schemes\u2014all the stories current were traced back to\u2014the\r\nlady herself! From her brain had emanated these ingenious myths, and\r\nshe was proved to have raised a considerable sum of money from various\r\ncredulous persons by her fiction of the \u201cCrown jewels\u201d\u2014the jewels in\r\nquestion being found to be mere paste imitations. Remorselessly the\r\nwhole story of her life was laid bare. The motive for the murder was\r\nfound in Mr. Hiram P. Trapp. Mr. Trapp did his best, but relentlessly\r\nand agilely cross-questioned he was forced to admit that he loved the\r\nlady, and that, had she been free, he would have asked her to be his\r\nwife. The fact that the relations between them were admittedly platonic\r\nstrengthened the case against the accused. Debarred from becoming his\r\nmistress by the simple honourable nature of the man, Jeanne Beroldy had\r\nconceived the monstrous project of ridding herself of her elderly\r\nundistinguished husband, and becoming the wife of the rich American.\r\n\r\nThroughout, Madame Beroldy confronted her accusers with complete sang\r\nfroid and self possession. Her story never varied. She continued to\r\ndeclare strenuously that she was of royal birth, and that she had been\r\nsubstituted for the daughter of the fruit seller at an early age.\r\nAbsurd and completely unsubstantiated as these statements were, a great\r\nnumber of people believed implicitly in their truth.\r\n\r\nBut the prosecution was implacable. It denounced the masked \u201cRussians\u201d\r\nas a myth, and asserted that the crime had been committed by Madame\r\nBeroldy and her lover, Georges Conneau. A warrant was issued for the\r\narrest of the latter, but he had wisely disappeared. Evidence showed\r\nthat the bonds which secured Madame Beroldy were so loose that she\r\ncould easily have freed herself.\r\n\r\nAnd then, towards the close of the trial, a letter, posted in Paris,\r\nwas sent to the Public Prosecutor. It was from Georges Conneau and,\r\nwithout revealing his whereabouts, it contained a full confession of\r\nthe crime. He declared that he had indeed struck the fatal blow at\r\nMadame Beroldy\u2019s instigation. The crime had been planned between them.\r\nBelieving that her husband ill-treated her, and maddened by his own\r\npassion for her, a passion which he believed her to return, he had\r\nplanned the crime and struck the fatal blow that should free the woman\r\nhe loved from a hateful bondage. Now, for the first time, he learnt of\r\nMr. Hiram P. Trapp, and realized that the woman he loved had betrayed\r\nhim! Not for his sake did she wish to be free\u2014but in order to marry the\r\nwealthy American. She had used him as a cat\u2019s-paw, and now, in his\r\njealous rage, he turned and denounced her, declaring that throughout he\r\nhad acted at her instigation.\r\n\r\nAnd then Madame Beroldy proved herself the remarkable woman she\r\nundoubtedly was. Without hesitation, she dropped her previous defence,\r\nand admitted that the \u201cRussians\u201d were a pure invention on her part. The\r\nreal murderer was Georges Conneau. Maddened by passion, he had\r\ncommitted the crime, vowing that if she did not keep silence he would\r\nenact a terrible vengeance from her. Terrified by his threats, she had\r\nconsented\u2014also fearing it likely that if she told the truth she might\r\nbe accused of conniving at the crime. But she had steadfastly refused\r\nto have anything more to do with her husband\u2019s murderer, and it was in\r\nrevenge for this attitude on her part that he had written this letter\r\naccusing her. She swore solemnly that she had had nothing to do with\r\nthe planning of the crime, that she had awoke on that memorable night\r\nto find Georges Conneau standing over her, the blood-stained knife in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nIt was a touch and go affair. Madame Beroldy\u2019s story was hardly\r\ncredible. But this woman, whose fairy tales of royal intrigues had been\r\nso easily accepted, had the supreme art of making herself believed. Her\r\naddress to the jury was a masterpiece. The tears streaming down her\r\nface, she spoke of her child, of her woman\u2019s honour\u2014of her desire to\r\nkeep her reputation untarnished for the child\u2019s sake. She admitted\r\nthat, Georges Conneau having been her lover, she might perhaps be held\r\nmorally responsible for the crime\u2014but, before God, nothing more! She\r\nknew that she had committed a grave fault in not denouncing Conneau to\r\nthe law, but she declared in a broken voice that that was a thing no\r\nwoman could have done.\u200a\u2026 She had loved him! Could she let her hand be\r\nthe one to send him to the Guillotine? She had been guilty of much, but\r\nshe was innocent of the terrible crime imputed to her.\r\n\r\nHowever that may have been, her eloquence and personality won the day.\r\nMadame Beroldy, amidst a scene of unparalleled excitement, was\r\nacquitted. Despite the utmost endeavours of the police, Georges Conneau\r\nwas never traced. As for Madame Beroldy, nothing more was heard of her.\r\nTaking the child with her, she left Paris to begin a new life.\r\n\nI have set down the Beroldy case in full. Of course all the details did\r\nnot present themselves to my memory as I have recounted them here.\r\nNevertheless, I recalled the case fairly accurately. It had attracted a\r\ngreat deal of interest at the time, and had been fully reported by the\r\nEnglish papers, so that it did not need much effort of memory on my\r\npart to recollect the salient details.\r\n\r\nJust for the moment, in my excitement, it seemed to clear up the whole\r\nmatter. I admit that I am impulsive, and Poirot deplores my custom of\r\njumping to conclusions, but I think I had some excuse in this instance.\r\nThe remarkable way in which this discovery justified Poirot\u2019s point of\r\nview struck me at once.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot,\u201d I said, \u201cI congratulate you. I see everything now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf that is indeed the truth, _I___ congratulate _you___, _mon ami___.\r\nFor as a rule you are not famous for seeing\u2014eh, is it not so?\u201d\r\n\r\nI felt a little annoyed.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome now, don\u2019t rub it in. You\u2019ve been so confoundedly mysterious all\r\nalong with your hints and your insignificant details that any one might\r\nfail to see what you were driving at.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot lit one of his little cigarettes with his usual precision. Then\r\nhe looked up.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd since you see everything now, _mon ami___, what exactly is it that\r\nyou see?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, that it was Madame Daubreuil\u2014Beroldy, who murdered Mr. Renauld.\r\nThe similarity of the two cases proves that beyond a doubt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you consider that Madame Beroldy was wrongly acquitted? That in\r\nactual fact she was guilty of connivance in her husband\u2019s murder?\u201d\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes wide.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut of course! Don\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot walked to the end of the room, absentmindedly straightened a\r\nchair, and then said thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that is my opinion. But there is no \u2018of course\u2019 about it, my\r\nfriend. Technically speaking, Madame Beroldy is innocent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf that crime, perhaps. But not of this.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot sat down again, and regarded me, his thoughtful air more marked\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo it is definitely your opinion, Hastings, that Madame Daubreuil\r\nmurdered M. Renauld?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe shot the question at me with such suddenness that I was taken aback.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I stammered. \u201cWhy? Oh, because\u2014\u201d I came to a stop.\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded his head at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, you come to a stumbling-block at once. Why should Madame\r\nDaubreuil (I shall call her that for clearness sake) murder M. Renauld?\r\nWe can find no shadow of a motive. She does not benefit by his death;\r\nconsidered as either mistress or blackmailer she stands to lose. You\r\ncannot have a murder without a motive. The first crime was different,\r\nthere we had a rich lover waiting to step into her husband\u2019s shoes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMoney is not the only motive for murder,\u201d I objected.\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue,\u201d agreed Poirot placidly. \u201cThere are two others, the _crime\r\npassionnel___ is one. And there is the third rare motive, murder for an\r\nidea which implies some form of mental derangement on the part of the\r\nmurderer. Homicidal mania, and religious fanaticism belong to that\r\nclass. We can rule it out here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what about the _crime passionnel?___ Can you rule that out? If\r\nMadame Daubreuil was Renauld\u2019s mistress, if she found that his\r\naffection was cooling, or if her jealousy was aroused in any way, might\r\nshe not have struck him down in a moment of anger?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf\u2014I say _if___, you note\u2014Madame Daubreuil was Renauld\u2019s mistress, he\r\nhad not had time to tire of her. And in any case you mistake her\r\ncharacter. She is a woman who can simulate great emotional stress. She\r\nis a magnificent actress. But, looked at dispassionately, her life\r\ndisproves her appearance. Throughout, if we examine it, she had been\r\ncold-blooded and calculating in her motives and actions. It was not to\r\nlink her life with that of her young lover that she connived at her\r\nhusband\u2019s murder. The rich American, for whom she probably did not care\r\na button, was her objective. If she committed a crime, she would always\r\ndo so for gain. Here there was no gain. Besides, how do you account for\r\nthe digging of the grave? That was a man\u2019s work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe might have had an accomplice,\u201d I suggested, unwilling to\r\nrelinquish my belief.\r\n\r\n\u201cI pass to another objection. You have spoken of the similarity between\r\nthe two crimes. Wherein does that lie, my friend?\u201d\r\n\r\nI stared at him in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, Poirot, it was you who remarked on that! The story of the masked\r\nmen, the \u2018secret,\u2019 the papers!\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled a little.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not be so indignant, I beg of you. I repudiate nothing. The\r\nsimilarity of the two stories links the two cases together inevitably.\r\nBut reflect now on something very curious. It is not Madame Daubreuil\r\nwho tells us this tale\u2014if it were all would indeed be plain sailing\u2014it\r\nis Madame Renauld. Is she then in league with the other?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cIf it is so, she must be the\r\nmost consummate actress the world has ever known.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTa-ta-ta,\u201d said Poirot impatiently. \u201cAgain you have the sentiment, and\r\nnot the logic! If it is necessary for a criminal to be a consummate\r\nactress, then by all means assume her to be one. But is it necessary? I\r\ndo not believe Madame Renauld to be in league with Madame Daubreuil for\r\nseveral reasons, some of which I have already enumerated to you. The\r\nothers are self-evident. Therefore, that possibility eliminated, we\r\ndraw very near to the truth which is, as always, very curious and\r\ninteresting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot,\u201d I cried, \u201cwhat more do you know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon ami___, you must make your own deductions. You have \u2018access to\r\nthe facts!\u2019 Concentrate your grey cells. Reason\u2014not like Giraud\u2014but\r\nlike Hercule Poirot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut are you _sure?___\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy friend, in many ways I have been an imbecile. But at last I see\r\nclearly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know everything?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have discovered what M. Renauld sent for me to discover.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you know the murderer?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know one murderer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe talk a little at cross-purposes. There are here not one crime, but\r\ntwo. The first I have solved, the second\u2014_eh bien___, I will confess, I\r\nam not sure!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, Poirot, I thought you said the man in the shed had died a natural\r\ndeath?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTa-ta-ta.\u201d Poirot made his favourite ejaculation of impatience. \u201cStill\r\nyou do not understand. One may have a crime without a murderer, but for\r\ntwo crimes it is essential to have two bodies.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis remark struck me as so peculiarly lacking in lucidity that I looked\r\nat him in some anxiety. But he appeared perfectly normal. Suddenly he\r\nrose and strolled to the window.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere he is,\u201d he observed.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cM. Jack Renauld. I sent a note up to the Villa to ask him to come\r\nhere.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat changed the course of my ideas, and I asked Poirot if he knew that\r\nJack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the crime. I had\r\nhoped to catch my astute little friend napping, but as usual, he was\r\nomniscient. He, too, had inquired at the station.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd without doubt we are not original in the idea, Hastings. The\r\nexcellent Giraud, he also has probably made his inquiries.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d I said, and then stopped. \u201cAh, no, it would be too\r\nhorrible!\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot looked inquiringly at me, but I said no more. It had just\r\noccurred to me that though there were seven women directly or\r\nindirectly connected with the case Mrs. Renauld, Madame Daubreuil and\r\nher daughter, the mysterious visitor, and the three servants\u2014there was,\r\nwith the exception of old Auguste who could hardly count, only one\r\nman\u2014Jack Renauld. _And a man must have dug a grave.\u200a\u2026___\r\n\r\nI had no time to develop further the appalling idea that had occurred\r\nto me, for Jack Renauld was ushered into the room.\r\n\r\nPoirot greeted him in a business-like manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake a seat, monsieur. I regret infinitely to derange you, but you\r\nwill perhaps understand that the atmosphere of the Villa is not too\r\ncongenial to me. M. Giraud and I do not see eye to eye about\r\neverything. His politeness to me has not been striking and you will\r\ncomprehend that I do not intend any little discoveries I may make to\r\nbenefit him in any way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly, M. Poirot,\u201d said the lad. \u201cThat fellow Giraud is an\r\nill-conditioned brute, and I\u2019d be delighted to see some one score at\r\nhis expense.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I may ask a little favour of you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will ask you to go to the railway station and take a train to the\r\nnext station along the line, Abbalac. Ask there at the cloak-room\r\nwhether two foreigners deposited a valise there on the night of the\r\nmurder. It is a small station, and they are almost certain to remember.\r\nWill you do this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course I will,\u201d said the boy, mystified, though ready for the task.\r\n\r\n\u201cI and my friend, you comprehend, have business elsewhere,\u201d explained\r\nPoirot. \u201cThere is a train in a quarter of an hour, and I will ask you\r\nnot to return to the Villa, as I have no wish for Giraud to get an\r\ninkling of your errand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, I will go straight to the station.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe rose to his feet. Poirot\u2019s voice stopped him.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne moment, M. Renauld, there is one little matter that puzzles me.\r\nWhy did you not mention to M. Hautet this morning that you were in\r\nMerlinville on the night of the crime?\u201d\r\n\r\nJack Renauld\u2019s face went crimson. With an effort he controlled himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have made a mistake. I was in Cherbourg, as I told the examining\r\nmagistrate this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot looked at him, his eyes narrowed, cat-like, until they only\r\nshowed a gleam of green.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen it is a singular mistake that I have made there\u2014for it is shared\r\nby the station staff. They say you arrived by the 11:40 train.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment Jack Renauld hesitated, then he made up his mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd if I did? I suppose you do not mean to accuse me of participating\r\nin my father\u2019s murder?\u201d He asked the question haughtily, his head\r\nthrown back.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like an explanation of the reason that brought you here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is simple enough. I came to see my fianc\u00e9e, Mademoiselle\r\nDaubreuil. I was on the eve of a long voyage, uncertain as to when I\r\nshould return. I wished to see her before I went, to assure her of my\r\nunchanging devotion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you did see her?\u201d Poirot\u2019s eyes never left the other\u2019s face.\r\n\r\nThere was an appreciable pause before Renauld replied. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd afterwards?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI found I had missed the last train. I walked to St. Beauvais where I\r\nknocked up a garage and got a car to take me back to Cherbourg.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSt. Beauvais? That is fifteen kilometres. A long walk, M. Renauld.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2014I felt like walking.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot bowed his head as a sign that he accepted the explanation. Jack\r\nRenauld took up his hat and cane and departed. In a trice Poirot jumped\r\nto his feet.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuick, Hastings. We will go after him.\u201d\r\n\r\nKeeping a discreet distance behind our quarry, we followed him through\r\nthe streets of Merlinville. But when Poirot saw that he took the\r\nturning to the station, he checked himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll is well. He has taken the bait. He will go to Abbalac, and will\r\ninquire for the mythical valise left by the mythical foreigners. Yes,\r\n_mon ami___, all that was a little invention of my own.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou wanted him out of the way!\u201d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour penetration is amazing, Hastings! Now, if you please, we will go\r\nup to the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve.\u201d\r\n\n\u201cBy the way, Poirot,\u201d I said, as we walked along the hot white road,\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a bone to pick with you. I dare say you meant well, but\r\nreally it was no business of yours to go mouching round to the H\u00f4tel du\r\nPhare without letting me know.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shot a quick sidelong glance at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how did you know I had been there?\u201d he inquired.\r\n\r\nMuch to my annoyance I felt the colour rising in my cheeks.\r\n\r\n\u201cI happened to look in in passing,\u201d I explained with as much dignity as\r\nI could muster.\r\n\r\nI rather feared Poirot\u2019s banter, but to my relief, and somewhat to my\r\nsurprise, he only shook his head with a rather unusual gravity.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I have offended your susceptibilities in any way, I demand pardon\r\nof you. You will understand better soon. But, believe me, I have\r\nstriven to concentrate all my energies on the case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s all right,\u201d I said, mollified by the apology. \u201cI know it\u2019s\r\nonly that you have my interests at heart. But I can take care of myself\r\nall right.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot seemed to be about to say something further, but checked\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nArrived at the Villa, Poirot led the way up to the shed where the\r\nsecond body had been discovered. He did not, however, go in, but paused\r\nby the bench which I have mentioned before as being set some few yards\r\naway from it. After contemplating it for a moment or two, he paced\r\ncarefully from it to the hedge which marked the boundary between the\r\nVilla Genevi\u00e8ve and the Villa Marguerite. Then he paced back again,\r\nnodding his head as he did so. Returning again to the hedge, he parted\r\nthe bushes with his hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cWith good fortune,\u201d he remarked to me over his shoulder, \u201cMademoiselle\r\nMarthe may find herself in the garden. I desire to speak to her and\r\nwould prefer not to call formally at the Villa Marguerite. Ah, all is\r\nwell, there she is. Pst, mademoiselle! Pst! _Un moment, s\u2019il vous\r\npla\u00eet.___\u201d\r\n\r\nI joined him at the moment that Marthe Daubreuil, looking slightly\r\nstartled, came running up to the hedge at his call.\r\n\r\n\u201cA little word with you, mademoiselle, if it is permitted?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, Monsieur Poirot.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite her acquiescence, her eyes looked troubled and afraid.\r\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle, do you remember running after me on the road the day\r\nthat I came to your house with the examining magistrate? You asked me\r\nif any one were suspected of the crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you told me two Chilians.\u201d Her voice sounded rather breathless,\r\nand her left hand stole to her breast.\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you ask me the same question again, mademoiselle?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis. If you were to ask me that question again, I should give you a\r\ndifferent answer. Some one is suspected\u2014but not a Chilian.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d The word came faintly between her parted lips.\r\n\r\n\u201cM. Jack Renauld.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d It was a cry. \u201cJack? Impossible. Who dares to suspect him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGiraud.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGiraud!\u201d The girl\u2019s face was ashy. \u201cI am afraid of that man. He is\r\ncruel. He will\u2014he will\u2014\u201d She broke off. There was courage gathering in\r\nher face, and determination. I realized in that moment that she was a\r\nfighter. Poirot, too, watched her intently.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know, of course, that he was here on the night of the murder?\u201d he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she replied mechanically. \u201cHe told me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was unwise to have tried to conceal the fact,\u201d ventured Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d she replied impatiently. \u201cBut we cannot waste time on\r\nregrets. We must find something to save him. He is innocent, of course,\r\nbut that will not help him with a man like Giraud who has his\r\nreputation to think of. He must arrest some one, and that some one will\r\nbe Jack.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe facts will tell against him,\u201d said Poirot. \u201cYou realize that?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe faced him squarely, and used the words I had heard her say in her\r\nmother\u2019s drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am not a child, monsieur. I can be brave and look facts in the face.\r\nHe is innocent, and we must save him.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe spoke with a kind of desperate energy, then was silent, frowning as\r\nshe thought.\r\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d said Poirot observing her keenly, \u201cis there not\r\nsomething that you are keeping back that you could tell us?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe nodded perplexedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, there is something, but I hardly know whether you will believe\r\nit\u2014it seems so absurd.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt any rate, tell us, mademoiselle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is this. M. Giraud sent for me, as an afterthought, to see if I\r\ncould identify the man in there.\u201d She signed with her head towards the\r\nshed. \u201cI could not. At least I could not at the moment. But since I\r\nhave been thinking\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems so queer, and yet I am almost sure. I will tell you. On the\r\nmorning of the day M. Renauld was murdered, I was walking in the garden\r\nhere, when I heard a sound of men\u2019s voices quarrelling. I pushed aside\r\nthe bushes and looked through. One of the men was M. Renauld and the\r\nother was a tramp, a dreadful looking creature in filthy rags. He was\r\nalternately whining and threatening. I gathered he was asking for\r\nmoney, but at that moment _maman___ called me from the house, and I had\r\nto go. That is all, only\u2014I am almost sure that the tramp and the dead\r\nman in the shed are one and the same.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot uttered an exclamation.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why did you not say so at the time, mademoiselle?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause at first it only struck me that the face was vaguely familiar\r\nin some way. The man was differently dressed, and apparently belonged\r\nto a superior station in life. But tell me, Monsieur Poirot, is it not\r\npossible that this tramp might have attacked and killed M. Renauld, and\r\ntaken his clothes and money?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is an idea, mademoiselle,\u201d said Poirot slowly. \u201cIt leaves a lot\r\nunexplained, but it is certainly an idea. I will think of it.\u201d\r\n\r\nA voice called from the house.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Maman___,\u201d whispered Marthe, \u201cI must go.\u201d And she slipped away\r\nthrough the trees.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d said Poirot, and taking my arm, turned in the direction of the\r\nVilla.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you really think?\u201d I asked, in some curiosity. \u201cWas that story\r\ntrue, or did the girl make it up in order to divert suspicion from her\r\nlover?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a curious tale,\u201d said Poirot, \u201cbut I believe it to be the\r\nabsolute truth. Unwittingly, Mademoiselle Marthe told us the truth on\r\nanother point\u2014and incidentally gave Jack Renauld the lie. Did you\r\nnotice his hesitation when I asked him if he saw Marthe Daubreuil on\r\nthe night of the crime? He paused and then said \u2018Yes.\u2019 I suspected that\r\nhe was lying. It was necessary for me to see Mademoiselle Marthe before\r\nhe could put her on her guard. Three little words gave me the\r\ninformation I wanted. When I asked her if she knew that Jack Renauld\r\nwas here that night, she answered \u2018He _told___ me.\u2019 Now, Hastings, what\r\nwas Jack Renauld doing here on that eventful evening, and if he did not\r\nsee Mademoiselle Marthe whom did he see?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely, Poirot,\u201d I cried, aghast, \u201cyou cannot believe that a boy like\r\nthat would murder his own father.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon ami___,\u201d said Poirot, \u201cyou continue to be of a sentimentality\r\nunbelievable! I have seen mothers who murdered their little children\r\nfor the sake of the insurance money! After that, one can believe\r\nanything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the motive?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMoney of course. Remember that Jack Renauld thought that he would come\r\nin to half his father\u2019s fortune at the latter\u2019s death.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the tramp. Where does he come in?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cGiraud would say that he was an accomplice\u2014an apache who helped young\r\nRenauld to commit the crime, and who was conveniently put out of the\r\nway afterwards.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the hair round the dagger? The woman\u2019s hair?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Poirot, smiling broadly. \u201cThat is the cream of Giraud\u2019s\r\nlittle jest. According to him, it is not a woman\u2019s hair at all.\r\nRemember that the youths of today wear their hair brushed straight back\r\nfrom the forehead with pomade or hairwash to make it lie flat.\r\nConsequently some of the hairs are of considerable length.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you believe that too?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Poirot with a curious smile. \u201cFor I know it to be the hair\r\nof a woman\u2014and more, which woman!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame Daubreuil,\u201d I announced positively.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d said Poirot, regarding me quizzically.\r\n\r\nBut I refused to allow myself to get annoyed.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to do now?\u201d I asked, as we entered the hall of the\r\nVilla Genevi\u00e8ve.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish to make a search amongst the effects of M. Jack Renauld. That\r\nis why I had to get him out of the way for a few hours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut will not Giraud have searched already?\u201d I asked doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course. He builds a case, as a beaver builds a dam, with a\r\nfatiguing industry. But he will not have looked for the things that I\r\nam seeking\u2014in all probability he would not have seen their importance\r\nif they stared him in the face. Let us begin.\u201d\r\n\r\nNeatly and methodically, Poirot opened each drawer in turn, examined\r\nthe contents, and returned them exactly to their places. It was a\r\nsingularly dull and uninteresting proceeding. Poirot waded on through\r\ncollars, pajamas and socks. A purring noise outside drew me to the\r\nwindow. Instantly I became galvanized into life.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot!\u201d I cried. \u201cA car has just driven up. Giraud is in it, and Jack\r\nRenauld, and two gendarmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Sacr\u00e9 tonnerre!___\u201d growled Poirot. \u201cThat animal of a Giraud, could\r\nhe not wait? I shall not be able to replace the things in this last\r\ndrawer with the proper method. Let us be quick.\u201d\r\n\r\nUnceremoniously he tumbled out the things on the floor, mostly ties and\r\nhandkerchiefs. Suddenly with a cry of triumph Poirot pounced on\r\nsomething, a small square cardboard, evidently a photograph. Thrusting\r\nit into his pocket, he returned the things pell-mell to the drawer, and\r\nseizing me by the arm dragged me out of the room and down the stairs.\r\nIn the hall stood Giraud, contemplating his prisoner.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood afternoon, M. Giraud,\u201d said Poirot. \u201cWhat have we here?\u201d\r\n\r\nGiraud nodded his head towards Jack.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was trying to make a getaway, but I was too sharp for him. He is\r\nunder arrest for the murder of his father, M. Paul Renauld.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot wheeled to confront the boy who leaned limply against the door,\r\nhis face ashy pale.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you say to that, _jeune homme?___\u201d\r\n\r\nJack Renauld stared at him stonily.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he said.\r\n\nI was dumbfounded. Up to the last, I had not been able bring myself to\r\nbelieve Jack Renauld guilty. I had expected a ringing proclamation of\r\nhis innocence when Poirot challenged him. But now, watching him as he\r\nstood, white and limp against the wall, and hearing the damning\r\nadmission fall from his lips, I doubted no longer.\r\n\r\nBut Poirot had turned to Giraud.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are your grounds for arresting him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you expect me to give them to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs a matter of courtesy, yes.\u201d\r\n\r\nGiraud looked at him doubtfully. He was torn between a desire to refuse\r\nrudely and the pleasure of triumphing over his adversary.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think I have made a mistake, I suppose?\u201d he sneered.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would not surprise me,\u201d replied Poirot, with a soup\u00e7on of malice.\r\n\r\nGiraud\u2019s face took on a deeper tinge of red.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien___, come in here. You shall judge for yourself.\u201d He flung\r\nopen the door of the _salon___, and we passed in, leaving Jack Renauld\r\nin the care of the two other men.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, M. Poirot,\u201d said Giraud laying his hat on the table, and speaking\r\nwith the utmost sarcasm, \u201cI will treat you to a little lecture on\r\ndetective work. I will show you how we moderns work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Bien!___\u201d said Poirot, composing himself to listen. \u201cI will show you\r\nhow admirably the Old Guard can listen,\u201d and he leaned back and closed\r\nhis eyes, opening them for a moment to remark. \u201cDo not fear that I\r\nshall sleep. I will attend most carefully.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d began Giraud, \u201cI soon saw through all that Chilian\r\ntomfoolery. Two men were in it\u2014but they were not mysterious foreigners!\r\nAll that was a blind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery creditable so far, my dear Giraud,\u201d murmured Poirot. \u201cEspecially\r\nafter that clever trick of theirs with the match and cigarette end.\u201d\r\n\r\nGiraud glared, but continued:\r\n\r\n\u201cA man must have been connected with the case, in order to dig the\r\ngrave. There is no man who actually benefits by the crime, but there\r\nwas a man who thought he would benefit. I heard of Jack Renauld\u2019s\r\nquarrel with his father, and of the threats that he had used. The\r\nmotive was established. Now as to means. Jack Renauld was in\r\nMerlinville that night. He concealed the fact\u2014which turned suspicion\r\ninto certainty. Then we found a second victim\u2014_stabbed with the same\r\ndagger___. We know when that dagger was stolen. Captain Hastings here\r\ncan fix the time. Jack Renauld, arriving from Cherbourg, was the only\r\nperson who could have taken it. I have accounted for all the other\r\nmembers of the household.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot interrupted:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are wrong. There is one other person who could have taken the\r\ndagger.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou refer to M. Stonor? He arrived at the front door, in an automobile\r\nwhich had brought him straight from Calais. Ah, believe me, I have\r\nlooked into everything. M. Jack Renauld arrived by train. An hour\r\nelapsed between his arrival, and the moment he presented himself at the\r\nhouse. Without doubt, he saw Captain Hastings and his companion leave\r\nthe shed, slipped in himself and took the dagger, stabbed his\r\naccomplice in the shed\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho was already dead!\u201d\r\n\r\nGiraud shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cPossibly he did not observe that. He may have judged him to be\r\nsleeping. Without doubt they had a rendezvous. In any case he knew this\r\napparent second murder would greatly complicate the case. It did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it could not deceive M. Giraud,\u201d murmured Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mock yourself at me. But I will give you one last irrefutable\r\nproof. Madame Renauld\u2019s story was false\u2014a fabrication from beginning to\r\nend. We believe Madame Renauld to have loved her husband\u2014_yet she lied\r\nto shield his murderer___. For whom will a woman lie? Sometimes for\r\nherself, usually for the man she loves, _always___ for her children.\r\nThat is the last\u2014the irrefutable proof. You cannot get round it.\u201d\r\n\r\nGiraud paused, flushed and triumphant. Poirot regarded him steadily.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is my case,\u201d said Giraud. \u201cWhat have you to say to it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly that there is one thing you have failed to take into account.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJack Renauld was presumably acquainted with the planning out of the\r\ngolf course. He knew that the body would be discovered almost at once,\r\nwhen they started to dig the bunker.\u201d\r\n\r\nGiraud laughed out loud.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it is idiotic what you say there! He wanted the body to be found!\r\nUntil it was found, he could not presume death, and would have been\r\nunable to enter into his inheritance.\u201d\r\n\r\nI saw a quick flash of green in Poirot\u2019s eyes as he rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen why bury it?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cReflect, Giraud. Since it was to\r\nJack Renauld\u2019s advantage that the body should be found without delay,\r\n_why dig a grave at all?___\u201d\r\n\r\nGiraud did not reply. The question found him unprepared. He shrugged\r\nhis shoulders as though to intimate that it was of no importance.\r\n\r\nPoirot moved towards the door. I followed him.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is one more thing that you have failed to take into account,\u201d he\r\nsaid over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe piece of lead piping,\u201d said Poirot, and left the room.\r\n\r\nJack Renauld still stood in the hall, with a white dumb face, but as we\r\ncame out of the _salon___, he looked up sharply. At the same moment\r\nthere was the sound of a footfall on the staircase. Mrs. Renauld was\r\ndescending it. At the sight of her son, standing between the two\r\nmyrmidons of the law, she stopped as though petrified.\r\n\r\n\u201cJack,\u201d she faltered. \u201cJack, what is this?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked up at her, his face set.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have arrested me, mother.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe uttered a piercing cry, and before any one could get to her swayed\r\nand fell heavily. We both ran to her and lifted her up. In a minute\r\nPoirot stood up again.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe has cut her head badly, on the corner of the stairs. I fancy there\r\nis a slight concussion also. If Giraud wants a statement from her, he\r\nwill have to wait. She will probably be unconscious for at least a\r\nweek.\u201d\r\n\r\nDenise and Fran\u00e7oise had run to their mistress, and leaving her in\r\ntheir charge Poirot left the house. He walked with his head bent down,\r\nfrowning thoughtfully at the ground. For some time I did not speak, but\r\nat last I ventured to put a question to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you believe then, in spite of all appearances to the contrary, that\r\nJack Renauld may not be guilty?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot did not answer at once, but after a long wait he said gravely:\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know, Hastings. There is just a chance of it. Of course\r\nGiraud is all wrong\u2014wrong from beginning to end. If Jack Renauld is\r\nguilty, it is in spite of Giraud\u2019s arguments, not _because___ of them.\r\nAnd the gravest indictment against him is known only to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I asked, impressed.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you would use your grey cells, and see the whole case clearly as I\r\ndo, you too would perceive it, my friend.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was what I called one of Poirot\u2019s irritating answers. He went on,\r\nwithout waiting for me to speak.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us walk this way to the sea. We will sit on that little mound\r\nthere, overlooking the beach, and review the case. You shall know all\r\nthat I know, but I would prefer that you should come at the truth by\r\nyour own efforts\u2014not by my leading you by the hand.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe established ourselves on the grassy knoll as Poirot had suggested,\r\nlooking out to sea. From farther along the sand, the cries of the\r\nbathers reached us faintly. The sea was of the palest blue, and the\r\nhalcyon calm reminded me of the day we had arrived at Merlinville, my\r\nown good spirits, and Poirot\u2019s suggestion that I was \u201cfey.\u201d What a long\r\ntime seemed to have elapsed since then. And in reality it was only\r\nthree days!\r\n\r\n\u201cThink, my friend,\u201d said Poirot\u2019s voice encouragingly. \u201cArrange your\r\nideas. Be methodical. Be orderly. There is the secret of success.\u201d\r\n\r\nI endeavoured to obey him, casting my mind back over all the details of\r\nthe case. And reluctantly it seemed to me that the only clear and\r\npossible solution was that of Giraud\u2014which Poirot despised. I reflected\r\nanew. If there was daylight anywhere it was in the direction of Madame\r\nDaubreuil. Giraud was ignorant of her connection with the Beroldy Case.\r\nPoirot had declared the Beroldy Case to be all important. It was there\r\nI must seek. I was on the right track now. And suddenly I started as an\r\nidea of bewildering luminosity shot into my brain. Trembling I built up\r\nmy hypothesis.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a little idea, I see, _mon ami!___ Capital. We progress.\u201d\r\n\r\nI sat up, and lit a pipe.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot,\u201d I said, \u201cit seems to me we have been strangely remiss. I say\r\nwe\u2014although I dare say _I___ would be nearer the mark. But you must pay\r\nthe penalty of your determined secrecy. So I say again we have been\r\nstrangely remiss. There is some one we have forgotten.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who is that?\u201d inquired Poirot, with twinkling eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cGeorges Conneau!\u201d\r\n\nThe next moment Poirot embraced me warmly. \u201c_Enfin!___ You have\r\narrived. And all by yourself. It is superb! Continue your reasoning.\r\nYou are right. Decidedly we have done wrong to forget Georges Conneau.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was so flattered by the little man\u2019s approval that I could hardly\r\ncontinue. But at last I collected my thoughts and went on.\r\n\r\n\u201cGeorges Conneau disappeared twenty years ago, but we have no reason to\r\nbelieve that he is dead.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Aucunement___,\u201d agreed Poirot. \u201cProceed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTherefore we will assume that he is alive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOr that he was alive until recently.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_De mieux en mieux!___\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will presume,\u201d I continued, my enthusiasm rising, \u201cthat he has\r\nfallen on evil days. He has become a criminal, an apache, a tramp\u2014a\r\nwhat you will. He chances to come to Merlinville. There he finds the\r\nwoman he has never ceased to love.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEh eh! The sentimentality,\u201d warned Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere one hates one also loves,\u201d I quoted or misquoted. \u201cAt any rate\r\nhe finds her there, living under an assumed name. But she has a new\r\nlover, the Englishman, Renauld. Georges Conneau, the memory of old\r\nwrongs rising in him, quarrels with this Renauld. He lies in wait for\r\nhim as he comes to visit his mistress, and stabs him in the back. Then,\r\nterrified at what he has done, he starts to dig a grave. I imagine it\r\nlikely that Madame Daubreuil comes out to look for her lover. She and\r\nConneau have a terrible scene. He drags her into the shed, and there\r\nsuddenly falls down in an epileptic fit. Now supposing Jack Renauld to\r\nappear. Madame Daubreuil tells him all, points out to him the dreadful\r\nconsequences to her daughter if this scandal of the past is revived.\r\nHis father\u2019s murderer is dead\u2014let them do their best to hush it up.\r\nJack Renauld consents\u2014goes to the house and has an interview with his\r\nmother, winning her over to his point of view. Primed with the story\r\nthat Madame Daubreuil has suggested to him, she permits herself to be\r\ngagged and bound. There, Poirot, what do you think of that?\u201d I leaned\r\nback, flushed with the pride of successful reconstruction.\r\n\r\nPoirot looked at me thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that you should write for the Kinema, _mon ami___,\u201d he\r\nremarked at last.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would make a good film, the story that you have recounted to me\r\nthere\u2014but it bears no sort of resemblance to everyday life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI admit that I haven\u2019t gone into all the details, but\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have gone further\u2014you have ignored them magnificently. What about\r\nthe way the two men were dressed? Do you suggest that after stabbing\r\nhis victim, Conneau removed his suit of clothes, donned it himself, and\r\nreplaced the dagger?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that that matters,\u201d I objected rather huffily. \u201cHe may\r\nhave obtained clothes and money from Madame Daubreuil by threats\r\nearlier in the day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy threats\u2014eh? You seriously advance that supposition?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. He could have threatened to reveal her identity to the\r\nRenaulds, which would probably have put an end to all hopes of her\r\ndaughter\u2019s marriage.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are wrong, Hastings. He could not blackmail her, for she had the\r\nwhip hand. Georges Conneau, remember, is still wanted for murder. A\r\nword from her and he is in danger of the guillotine.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was forced, rather reluctantly, to admit the truth of this.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Your___ theory,\u201d I remarked acidly, \u201cis doubtless correct as to all\r\nthe details?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy theory is the truth,\u201d said Poirot quietly. \u201cAnd the truth is\r\nnecessarily correct. In your theory you made a fundamental error. You\r\npermitted your imagination to lead you astray with midnight\r\nassignations and passionate love scenes. But in investigating crime we\r\nmust take our stand upon the commonplace. Shall I demonstrate my\r\nmethods to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, by all means let us have a demonstration!\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot sat very upright and began, wagging his forefinger emphatically\r\nto emphasize his points.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will start as you started from the basic fact of Georges Conneau.\r\nNow the story told by Madame Beroldy in court as to the \u2018Russians\u2019 was\r\nadmittedly a fabrication. If she was innocent of connivance in the\r\ncrime, it was concocted by her, and by her only as she stated. If, on\r\nthe other hand, she was not innocent, it might have been invented by\r\neither her or Georges Conneau.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow in this case we are investigating, we meet the same tale. As I\r\npointed out to you, the facts render it very unlikely that Madame\r\nDaubreuil inspired it. So we turn to the hypothesis that the story had\r\nits origin in the brain of Georges Conneau. Very good. Georges Conneau,\r\ntherefore, planned the crime with Madame Renauld as his accomplice. She\r\nis in the limelight, and behind her is a shadowy figure whose alias is\r\nunknown to us.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow let us go carefully over the Renauld Case from the beginning,\r\nsetting down each significant point in its chronological order. You\r\nhave a notebook and pencil? Good. Now what is the earliest point to\r\nnote down?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe letter to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was the first we knew of it, but it is not the proper beginning\r\nof the case. The first point of any significance, I should say, is the\r\nchange that came over M. Renauld shortly after arriving in Merlinville,\r\nand which is attested to by several witnesses. We have also to consider\r\nhis friendship with Madame Daubreuil, and the large sums of money paid\r\nover to her. From thence we can come directly to the 23rd May.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot paused, cleared his throat, and signed to me to write.\r\n\r\n\u201c_23rd May.___ M. Renauld quarrels with his son over latter\u2019s wish to\r\nmarry Marthe Daubreuil. Son leaves for Paris.\r\n\r\n\u201c_24th May.___ M. Renauld alters his will, leaving entire control of\r\nhis fortune in his wife\u2019s hands.\r\n\r\n\u201c_7th June.___ Quarrel with tramp in garden, witnessed by Marthe\r\nDaubreuil.\r\n\r\n\u201cLetter written to M. Hercule Poirot, imploring assistance.\r\n\r\n\u201cTelegram sent to Jack Renauld, bidding him proceed by the _Anzora___\r\nto Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\n\u201cChauffeur, Masters, sent off on a holiday.\r\n\r\n\u201cVisit of a lady, that evening. As he is seeing her out, his words are\r\n\u2018Yes, yes\u2014but for God\u2019s sake go now.\u200a\u2026\u2019\u200a\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot paused.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, Hastings, take each of those facts one by one, consider them\r\ncarefully by themselves and in relation to the whole, and see if you do\r\nnot get new light on the matter.\u201d\r\n\r\nI endeavoured conscientiously to do as he had said. After a moment or\r\ntwo, I said rather doubtfully:\r\n\r\n\u201cAs to the first points, the question seems to be whether we adopt the\r\ntheory of blackmail, or of an infatuation for this woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBlackmail, decidedly. You heard what Stonor said as to his character\r\nand habits.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Renauld did not confirm his view,\u201d I argued.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have already seen that Madame Renauld\u2019s testimony cannot be relied\r\nupon in any way. We must trust to Stonor on that point.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStill, if Renauld had an affair with a woman called Bella, there seems\r\nno inherent improbability in his having another with Madame Daubreuil.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone whatever, I grant you, Hastings. But did he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe letter, Poirot. You forget the letter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I do not forget. But what makes you think that letter was written\r\nto M. Renauld?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy it was found in his pocket and\u2014and\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that is all!\u201d cut in Poirot. \u201cThere was no mention of any name to\r\nshow to whom the letter was addressed. We assumed it was to the dead\r\nman because it was in the pocket of his overcoat. Now, _mon ami___,\r\nsomething about that overcoat struck me as unusual. I measured it, and\r\nmade the remark that he wore his overcoat very long. That remark should\r\nhave given you to think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you were just saying it for the sake of saying something,\u201d I\r\nconfessed.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, _quelle id\u00e9e!___ Later you observed me measuring the overcoat of\r\nM. Jack Renauld. _Eh bien___, M. Jack Renauld wears his overcoat very\r\nshort. Put those two facts together with a third, namely that M. Jack\r\nRenauld flung out of the house in a hurry on his departure for Paris,\r\nand tell me what you make of it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d I said slowly, as the meaning of Poirot\u2019s remarks bore in upon\r\nme. \u201cThat letter was written to Jack Renauld\u2014not to his father. He\r\ncaught up the wrong overcoat in his haste and agitation.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Pr\u00e9cisement!___ We can return to this point later. For the moment let\r\nus content ourselves with accepting the letter as having nothing to do\r\nwith M. Renauld _p\u00e8re___, and pass to the next chronological event.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMay 23rd,\u201d I read, \u201cM. Renauld quarrels with his son over latter\u2019s\r\nwish to marry Marthe Daubreuil. Son leaves for Paris. I don\u2019t see\r\nanything much to remark upon there, and the altering of the will the\r\nfollowing day seems straightforward enough. It was the direct result of\r\nthe quarrel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe agree, _mon ami___\u2014at least as to the cause. But what exact motive\r\nunderlay this procedure of M. Renauld\u2019s?\u201d\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes in surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnger against his son of course.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYet he wrote him affectionate letters to Paris?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo Jack Renauld says, but he cannot produce them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, let us pass from that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow we come to the day of the tragedy. You have placed the events of\r\nthe morning in a certain order. Have you any justification for that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have ascertained that the letter to me was posted at the same time\r\nas the telegram was despatched. Masters was informed he could take a\r\nholiday shortly afterwards. In my opinion the quarrel with the tramp\r\ntook place anterior to these happenings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not see that you can fix that definitely\u2014unless you question\r\nMademoiselle Dabreuil again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no need. I am sure of it. And if you do not see that, you see\r\nnothing, Hastings!\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked at him for a moment.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course! I am an idiot. If the tramp was Georges Conneau, it was\r\nafter the stormy interview with him that Mr. Renauld apprehended\r\ndanger. He sent away the chauffeur, Masters, whom he suspected of being\r\nin the other\u2019s pay, he wired to his son, and sent for you.\u201d\r\n\r\nA faint smile crossed Poirot\u2019s lips.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do not think it strange that he should use exactly the same\r\nexpressions in his letter as Madame Renauld used later in her story? If\r\nthe mention of Santiago was a blind, why should Renauld speak of it,\r\nand\u2014what is more\u2014send his son there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is puzzling, I admit, but perhaps we shall find some explanation\r\nlater. We come now to the evening, and the visit of the mysterious\r\nlady. I confess that that fairly baffles me, unless it was Madame\r\nDaubreuil, as Fran\u00e7oise all along maintained.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy friend, my friend, where are your wits wandering? Remember the\r\nfragment of cheque, and the fact that the name Bella Duveen was faintly\r\nfamiliar to Stonor, and I think we may take it for granted that Bella\r\nDuveen is the full name of Jack\u2019s unknown correspondent, and that it\r\nwas she who came to the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve that night. Whether she\r\nintended to see Jack, or whether she meant all along to appeal to his\r\nfather we cannot be certain, but I think we may assume that this is\r\nwhat occurred. She produced her claim upon Jack, probably showed\r\nletters that he had written her, and the older man tried to buy her off\r\nby writing a cheque. This she indignantly tore up. The terms of her\r\nletter are those of a woman genuinely in love, and she would probably\r\ndeeply resent being offered money. In the end he got rid of her, and\r\nhere the words that he used are significant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u200a\u2018Yes, yes, but for God\u2019s sake go now,\u2019\u200a\u201d I repeated. \u201cThey seem to me\r\na little vehement, perhaps, that is all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is enough. He was desperately anxious for the girl to go. Why?\r\nNot only because the interview was unpleasant. No, it was the time that\r\nwas slipping by, and for some reason time was precious.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy should it be?\u201d I asked, bewildered.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is what we ask ourselves. Why should it be? But later we have the\r\nincident of the wrist watch\u2014which again shows us that time plays a very\r\nimportant part in the crime. We are now fast approaching the actual\r\ndrama. It is half-past ten when Bella Duveen leaves, and by the\r\nevidence of the wrist watch we know that the crime was committed, or at\r\nany rate that it was staged, before twelve o\u2019clock. We have reviewed\r\nall the events anterior to the murder, there remains only one unplaced.\r\nBy the doctor\u2019s evidence, the tramp, when found, had been dead at least\r\nforty-eight hours\u2014with a possible margin of twenty-four hours more.\r\nNow, with no other facts to help me than those we have discussed, I\r\nplace the death as having occurred on the morning of June 7th.\u201d\r\n\r\nI stared at him, stupefied.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how? Why? How can you possibly know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause only in that way can the sequence of events be logically\r\nexplained. _Mon ami___, I have taken you step by step along the way. Do\r\nyou not now see what is so glaringly plain?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Poirot, I can\u2019t see anything glaring about it. I did think I\r\nwas beginning to see my way before, but I\u2019m now hopelessly fogged.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot looked at me sadly, and shook his head. \u201c_Mon Dieu!___ But it is\r\n_triste!___ A good intelligence\u2014and so deplorably lacking in method.\r\nThere is an exercise most excellent for the development of the little\r\ngrey cells. I will impart it to you\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor Heaven\u2019s sake, not now! You really are the most irritating of\r\nfellows, Poirot. For goodness\u2019 sake, get on and tell me who killed M.\r\nRenauld.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is just what I am not sure of as yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you said it was glaringly clear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe talk at cross-purposes, my friend. Remember, it is two crimes we\r\nare investigating\u2014for which, as I pointed out to you, we have the\r\nnecessary two bodies. There, there, _ne vous impatientez pas!___ I\r\nexplain all. To begin with, we apply our psychology. We find three\r\npoints at which M. Renauld displays a distinct change of view and\r\naction\u2014three psychological points therefore. The first occurs\r\nimmediately after arriving in Merlinville, the second after quarrelling\r\nwith his son on a certain subject, the third on the morning of June\r\n7th. Now for the three causes. We can attribute No. 1 to meeting Madame\r\nDaubreuil. No. 2 is indirectly connected with her since it concerns a\r\nmarriage between M. Renauld\u2019s son and her daughter. But the cause of\r\nNo. 3 is hidden from us. We have to deduce it. Now, _mon ami___, let me\r\nask you a question; who do we believe to have planned this crime?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGeorges Conneau,\u201d I said doubtfully, eyeing Poirot warily.\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. Now Giraud laid it down as an axiom that a woman lies to save\r\nherself, the man she loves, and her child. Since we are satisfied that\r\nwas Georges Conneau who dictated the lie to her, and as Georges Conneau\r\nis not Jack Renauld, follows that the third case is put out of court.\r\nAnd, still attributing the crime to Georges Conneau, the first is\r\nequally so. So we are forced to the second\u2014that Madame Renauld lied for\r\nthe sake of the man she loved\u2014or in other words, for the sake of\r\nGeorges Conneau. You agree to that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I admitted. \u201cIt seems logical enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Bien!___ Madame Renauld loves Georges Conneau. Who, then, is Georges\r\nConneau?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe tramp.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave we any evidence to show that Madame Renauld loved the tramp?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well then. Do not cling to theories where facts no longer support\r\nthem. Ask yourself instead who Madame Renauld _did___ love.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head perplexed.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mais, oui___, you know perfectly. Who did Madame Renauld love so\r\ndearly that when she saw his dead body, she fell down in a swoon?\u201d\r\n\r\nI stared dumbfounded.\r\n\r\n\u201cHer husband?\u201d I gasped.\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cHer husband\u2014or Georges Conneau, whichever you like to call him.\u201d\r\n\r\nI rallied myself.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s impossible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow \u2018impossible?\u2019 Did we not agree just now that Madame Daubreuil was\r\nin a position to blackmail Georges Conneau?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd did she not very effectively blackmail M. Renauld?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat may be true enough, but\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd is it not a fact that we know nothing of M. Renauld\u2019s youth and\r\nupbringing? That he springs suddenly into existence as a French\r\nCanadian exactly twenty-two years ago?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll that is so,\u201d I said more firmly, \u201cbut you seem to me to be\r\noverlooking one salient point.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it, my friend?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, we have admitted Georges Conneau planned the crime. That brings\r\nus to the ridiculous statement that he planned his own murder!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien, mon ami___,\u201d said Poirot placidly, \u201cthat is just what he did\r\ndo!\u201d\r\n\nIn a measured voice, Poirot began his exposition.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems strange to you, _mon ami___, that a man should plan his own\r\ndeath? So strange, that you prefer to reject the truth as fantastic,\r\nand to revert to a story that is in reality ten times more impossible.\r\nYes, M. Renauld planned his own death, but there is one detail that\r\nperhaps escapes you\u2014he did not intend to die.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head, bewildered.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut no, it is all most simple really,\u201d said Poirot kindly. \u201cFor the\r\ncrime that M. Renauld proposed a murderer was not necessary, as I told\r\nyou, but a body was. Let us reconstruct, seeing events this time from a\r\ndifferent angle.\r\n\r\n\u201cGeorges Conneau flies from justice\u2014to Canada. There, under an assumed\r\nname he marries, and finally acquires a vast fortune in South America.\r\nBut there is a nostalgia upon him for his own country. Twenty years\r\nhave elapsed, he is considerably changed in appearance, besides being a\r\nman of such eminence that no one is likely to connect him with a\r\nfugitive from justice many years ago. He deems it quite safe to return.\r\nHe takes up his headquarters in England, but intends to spend the\r\nsummers in France. And ill fortune, that obscure justice which shapes\r\nmen\u2019s ends, and will not allow them to evade the consequences of their\r\nacts, takes him to Merlinville. There, in the whole of France, is the\r\none person who is capable of recognizing him. It is, of course, a gold\r\nmine to Madame Daubreuil, and a gold mine of which she is not slow to\r\ntake advantage. He is helpless, absolutely in her power. And she bleeds\r\nhim heavily.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then the inevitable happens. Jack Renauld falls in love with the\r\nbeautiful girl he sees almost daily, and wishes to marry her. That\r\nrouses his father. At all costs, he will prevent his son marrying the\r\ndaughter of this evil woman. Jack Renauld knows nothing of his father\u2019s\r\npast, but Madame Renauld knows everything. She is a woman of great\r\nforce of character, and passionately devoted to her husband. They take\r\ncounsel together. Renauld sees only one way of escape\u2014death. He must\r\nappear to die, in reality escaping to another country where he will\r\nstart again under an assumed name, and where Madame Renauld, having\r\nplayed the widow\u2019s part for a while, can join him. It is essential that\r\nshe should have control of the money, so he alters his will. How they\r\nmeant to manage the body business originally, I do not know\u2014possibly an\r\nart student\u2019s skeleton\u2014and a fire or something of the kind, but long\r\nbefore their plans have matured an event occurs which plays into their\r\nhands. A rough tramp, violent and abusive, finds his way into the\r\ngarden. There is a struggle, M. Renauld seeks to eject him, and\r\nsuddenly the tramp, an epileptic, falls down in a fit. He is dead. M.\r\nRenauld calls his wife. Together they drag him into the shed\u2014as we\r\nknow, the event had occurred just outside\u2014and they realize the\r\nmarvellous opportunity that has been vouchsafed them. The man bears no\r\nresemblance to M. Renauld, but he is middle-aged, of a usual French\r\ntype. That is sufficient.\r\n\r\n\u201cI rather fancy that they sat on the bench up there, out of earshot\r\nfrom the house, discussing matters. Their plan was quickly made. The\r\nidentification must rest solely on Madame Renauld\u2019s evidence. Jack\r\nRenauld and the chauffeur (who had been with his master two years) must\r\nbe got out of the way. It was unlikely that the French women servants\r\nwould go near the body, and in any case Renauld intended to take\r\nmeasures to deceive any one not likely to appreciate details. Masters\r\nwas sent off, a telegram despatched to Jack, Buenos Ayres being\r\nselected to give credence to the story that Renauld had decided upon.\r\nHaving heard of me, as a rather obscure elderly detective, he wrote his\r\nappeal for help knowing that, when I arrived, the production of the\r\nletter would have a profound effect upon the examining\r\nmagistrate\u2014which, of course, it did.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey dressed the body of the tramp in a suit of M. Renauld\u2019s and left\r\nhis ragged coat and trousers by the door of the shed, not daring to\r\ntake them into the house. And then, to give credence to the tale Madame\r\nRenauld was to tell, they drove the aeroplane dagger through his heart.\r\nThat night, M. Renauld will first bind and gag his wife, and then,\r\ntaking a spade, will dig a grave in that particular spot of ground\r\nwhere he knows a\u2014how do you call it? bunkair?\u2014is to be made. It is\r\nessential that the body should be found\u2014Madame Daubreuil must have no\r\nsuspicions. On the other hand, if a little time elapses, any dangers as\r\nto identity will be greatly lessened. Then, M. Renauld will don the\r\ntramp\u2019s rags, and shuffle off to the station, where he will leave,\r\nunnoticed, by the 12:10 train. Since the crime will be supposed to have\r\ntaken place two hours later, no suspicion can possibly attach to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see now his annoyance at the inopportune visit of the girl Bella.\r\nEvery moment of delay is fatal to his plans. He gets rid of her as soon\r\nas he can, however. Then, to work! He leaves the front door slightly\r\najar to create the impression that the assassins left that way. He\r\nbinds and gags Madame Renauld, correcting his mistake of twenty-two\r\nyears ago, when the looseness of the bonds caused suspicion to fall\r\nupon his accomplice, but leaving her primed with essentially the same\r\nstory as he had invented before, proving the unconscious recoil of the\r\nmind against originality. The night is chilly, and he slips on an\r\novercoat over his underclothing, intending to cast it into the grave\r\nwith the dead man. He goes out by the window, smoothing over the flower\r\nbed carefully, and thereby furnishing the most positive evidence\r\nagainst himself. He goes out on to the lonely golf links, and he\r\ndigs\u2014and then\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then,\u201d said Poirot gravely, \u201cthe justice that he has so long\r\neluded overtakes him. An unknown hand stabs him in the back.\u200a\u2026 Now,\r\nHastings, you understand what I mean when I talk of _two___ crimes. The\r\nfirst crime, the crime that M. Renauld, in his arrogance, asked us to\r\ninvestigate (ah, but he made a famous mistake there! He misjudged\r\nHercule Poirot!) is solved. But behind it lies a deeper riddle. And to\r\nsolve that will be difficult\u2014since the criminal in his wisdom, has been\r\ncontent to avail himself of the devices prepared by M. Renauld. It has\r\nbeen a particularly perplexing and baffling mystery to solve. A young\r\nhand, like Giraud, who does not place any reliance on the psychology,\r\nis almost certain to fail.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re marvellous, Poirot,\u201d I said, with admiration. \u201cAbsolutely\r\nmarvellous. No one on earth but you could have done it!\u201d\r\n\r\nI think my praise pleased him. For once in his life, he looked almost\r\nembarrassed.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, then you no longer despise poor old Papa Poirot? You shift your\r\nallegiance back from the human foxhound?\u201d\r\n\r\nHis term for Giraud never failed to make me smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cRather. You\u2019ve scored over him handsomely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat poor Giraud,\u201d said Poirot, trying unsuccessfully to look modest.\r\n\u201cWithout doubt it is not all stupidity. He has had _la mauvaise\r\nchance___ once or twice. That dark hair coiled round the dagger, for\r\ninstance. To say the least, it was misleading.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo tell you the truth, Poirot,\u201d I said slowly, \u201ceven now I don\u2019t quite\r\nsee\u2014whose hair was it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame Renauld\u2019s of course. That is where _la mauvaise chance___ came\r\nin. Her hair, dark originally, is almost completely silvered. It might\r\njust as easily have been a grey hair\u2014and then, by no conceivable effort\r\ncould Giraud have persuaded himself it came from the head of Jack\r\nRenauld! But it is all of a piece. Always the facts must be twisted to\r\nfit the theory! Did not Giraud find the traces of two persons, a man\r\nand a woman, in the shed? And how does that fit in with his\r\nreconstruction of the case? I will tell you\u2014it does not fit in, and so\r\nwe shall hear no more of them! I ask you, is that a methodical way of\r\nworking? The great Giraud! The great Giraud is nothing but a toy\r\nballoon\u2014swollen with its own importance. But I, Hercule Poirot, whom he\r\ndespises, will be the little pin that pricks the big balloon\u2014_comme\r\n\u00e7a!___\u201d And he made an expressive gesture. Then, calming down, he\r\nresumed:\r\n\r\n\u201cWithout doubt, when Madame Renauld recovers, she will speak. The\r\npossibility of her son being accused of the murder never occurred to\r\nher. How should it, when she believed him safely at sea on board the\r\n_Anzora?___ _Ah! voil\u00e0 une femme___, Hastings! What force, what\r\nself-command! She only made one slip. On his unexpected return: \u2018It\r\ndoes not matter\u2014_now___.\u2019 And no one noticed\u2014no one realized the\r\nsignificance of those words. What a terrible part she has had to play,\r\npoor woman. Imagine the shock when she goes to identify the body and,\r\ninstead of what she expects, sees the actual lifeless form of the\r\nhusband she has believed miles away by now. No wonder she fainted! But\r\nsince then, despite her grief and her despair, how resolutely she has\r\nplayed her part, and how the anguish of it must wring her. She cannot\r\nsay a word to set us on the track of the real murderers. For her son\u2019s\r\nsake, no one must know that Paul Renauld was Georges Conneau, the\r\ncriminal. Final and most bitter blow, she has admitted publicly that\r\nMadame Daubreuil was her husband\u2019s mistress\u2014for a hint of blackmail\r\nmight be fatal to her secret. How cleverly she dealt with the examining\r\nmagistrate when he asked her if there was any mystery in her husband\u2019s\r\npast life. \u2018Nothing so romantic, I am sure, M. le juge.\u2019 It was\r\nperfect, the indulgent tone, the _soup\u00e7on___ of sad mockery. At once M.\r\nHautet felt himself foolish and melodramatic. Yes, she is a great\r\nwoman! If she loved a criminal, she loved him royally!\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot lost himself in contemplation.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne thing more, Poirot, what about the piece of lead piping?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do not see? To disfigure the victim\u2019s face so that it would be\r\nunrecognizable. It was that which first set me on the right track. And\r\nthat imbecile of a Giraud, swarming all over it to look for match ends!\r\nDid I not tell you that a clue of two feet long was quite as good as a\r\nclue of two inches?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Giraud will sing small now,\u201d I observed hastily, to lead the\r\nconversation away from my own shortcomings.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I said before, will he? If he has arrived at the right person by\r\nthe wrong method, he will not permit that to worry him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut surely\u2014\u201d I paused as I saw the new trend of things.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, Hastings, we must now start again. Who killed M. Renauld?\r\nSome one who was near the Villa just before twelve o\u2019clock that night,\r\nsome one who would benefit by his death\u2014the description fits Jack\r\nRenauld only too well. The crime need not have been premeditated. And\r\nthen the dagger!\u201d\r\n\r\nI started, I had not realized that point.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said. \u201cThe second dagger we found in the tramp was Mrs.\r\nRenauld\u2019s. There _were___ two, then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly, and, since they were duplicates, it stands to reason that\r\nJack Renauld was the owner. But that would not trouble me so much. In\r\nfact I have a little idea as to that. No, the worst indictment against\r\nhim is again psychological\u2014heredity, _mon ami___, heredity! Like\r\nfather, like son\u2014Jack Renauld, when all is said or done, is the son of\r\nGeorges Conneau.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis tone was grave and earnest, and I was impressed in spite of myself.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is your little idea that you mentioned just now?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\nFor answer, Poirot consulted his turnip-faced watch, and then asked:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat time is the afternoon boat from Calais?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout five, I believe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will do very well. We shall just have time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are going to England?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, my friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo find a possible\u2014witness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a rather peculiar smile upon his face, Poirot replied:\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Bella Duveen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how will you find her\u2014what do you know about her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know nothing about her\u2014but I can guess a good deal. We may take it\r\nfor granted that her name _is___ Bella Duveen, and since that name was\r\nfaintly familiar to M. Stonor, though evidently not in connection with\r\nthe Renauld family, it is probable that she is on the stage. Jack\r\nRenauld was a young man with plenty of money, and twenty years of age.\r\nThe stage is sure to have been the home of his first love. It tallies,\r\ntoo, with M. Renauld\u2019s attempt to placate her with a cheque. I think I\r\nshall find her all right\u2014especially with the help of _this___.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd he brought out the photograph I had seen him take from Jack\r\nRenauld\u2019s drawer. \u201cWith love from Bella,\u201d was scrawled across the\r\ncorner, but it was not that which held my eyes fascinated. The likeness\r\nwas not first rate\u2014but for all that it was unmistakable to me. I felt a\r\ncold sinking, as though some unutterable calamity had befallen me.\r\n\r\nIt was the face of Cinderella.\r\n\nFor a moment or two I sat as though frozen, the photograph still in my\r\nhand. Then, summoning all my courage to appear unmoved, I handed it\r\nback. At the same time, I stole a quick glance at Poirot. Had he\r\nnoticed anything? But to my relief he did not seem to be observing me.\r\nAnything unusual in my manner had certainly escaped him.\r\n\r\nHe rose briskly to his feet.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have no time to lose. We must make our departure with all despatch.\r\nAll is well\u2014the sea it will be calm!\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the bustle of departure, I had no time for thinking, but once on\r\nboard the boat, secure from Poirot\u2019s observation (he, as usual, was\r\n\u201cpractising the method most excellent of Laverguier\u201d) I pulled myself\r\ntogether, and attacked the facts dispassionately. How much did Poirot\r\nknow? Was he aware that my acquaintance of the train and Bella Duveen\r\nwere one and the same? Why had he gone to the H\u00f4tel du Phare? On my\r\nbehalf as I had believed? Or had I only fatuously thought so, and was\r\nthis visit undertaken with a deeper and more sinister purpose?\r\n\r\nBut in any case, why was he bent on finding this girl? Did he suspect\r\nher of having seen Jack Renauld commit the crime? Or did he suspect\u2014but\r\nthat was impossible! The girl had no grudge against the elder Renauld,\r\nno possible motive for wishing his death. What had brought her back to\r\nthe scene of the murder? I went over the facts carefully. She must have\r\nleft the train at Calais where I parted from her that day. No wonder I\r\nhad been unable to find her on the boat. If she had dined in Calais,\r\nand then taken a train out to Merlinville, she would have arrived at\r\nthe Villa Genevi\u00e8ve just about the time that Fran\u00e7oise said. What had\r\nshe done when she left the house just after ten? Presumably either gone\r\nto an hotel, or returned to Calais. And then? The crime had been\r\ncommitted on Tuesday night. On Thursday morning, she was once more in\r\nMerlinville. Had she ever left France at all? I doubted it very much.\r\nWhat kept her there\u2014the hope of seeing Jack Renauld? I had told her (as\r\nat the time we believed) that he was on the high seas _en route___ to\r\nBuenos Ayres. Possibly she was aware that the _Anzora___ had not\r\nsailed. But to know that she must have seen Jack. Was that what Poirot\r\nwas after? Had Jack Renauld, returning to see Marthe Daubreuil, come\r\nface to face instead with Bella Duveen, the girl he had heartlessly\r\nthrown over?\r\n\r\nI began to see daylight. If that were indeed the case, it might furnish\r\nJack with the alibi he needed. Yet under those circumstances his\r\nsilence seemed difficult to explain. Why could he not have spoken out\r\nboldly? Did he fear for this former entanglement of his to come to the\r\nears of Marthe Daubreuil? I shook my head, dissatisfied. The thing had\r\nbeen harmless enough, a foolish boy and girl affair, and I reflected\r\ncynically that the son of a millionaire was not likely to be thrown\r\nover by a penniless French girl, who moreover loved him devotedly,\r\nwithout a much graver cause.\r\n\r\nAltogether I found the affair puzzling and unsatisfactory. I disliked\r\nintensely being associated with Poirot in hunting this girl down, but I\r\ncould not see any way of avoiding it, without revealing everything to\r\nhim, and this, for some reason, I was loath to do.\r\n\r\nPoirot reappeared brisk and smiling at Dover, and our journey to London\r\nwas uneventful. It was past nine o\u2019clock when we arrived, and I\r\nsupposed that we should return straight away to our rooms and do\r\nnothing till the morning. But Poirot had other plans.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must lose no time, _mon ami___. The news of the arrest will not be\r\nin the English papers until the day after tomorrow, but still we must\r\nlose no time.\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not quite follow his reasoning, but I merely asked how he\r\nproposed to find the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou remember Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent? No? I assisted him\r\nin a little matter of a Japanese wrestler. A pretty little problem, I\r\nmust recount it to you one day. He, without doubt, will be able to put\r\nus in the way of finding out what we want to know.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt took us some time to run Mr. Aarons to earth, and it was after\r\nmidnight when we finally managed it. He greeted Poirot with every\r\nevidence of warmth, and professed himself ready to be of service to us\r\nin any way.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much about the profession I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, beaming\r\ngenially.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien___, M. Aarons, I desire to find a young girl called Bella\r\nDuveen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBella Duveen. I know the name, but for the moment I can\u2019t place it.\r\nWhat\u2019s her line?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat I do not know\u2014but here is her photograph.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Aarons studied it for a moment, then his face lighted.\r\n\r\n\u201cGot it!\u201d He slapped his thigh. \u201cThe Dulcibella Kids, by the Lord!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Dulcibella Kids?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it. They\u2019re sisters. Acrobats, dancers and singers. Give quite\r\na good little turn. They\u2019re in the provinces somewhere, I believe\u2014if\r\nthey\u2019re not resting. They\u2019ve been on in Paris for the last two or three\r\nweeks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you find out for me exactly where they are?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEasy as a bird. You go home, and I\u2019ll send you round the dope in the\r\nmorning.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith this promise we took leave of him. He was as good as his word.\r\nAbout eleven o\u2019clock the following day, a scribbled note reached us.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Dulcibella Sisters are on at the Palace in Coventry. Good luck to\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\nWithout more ado, we started for Coventry. Poirot made no inquiries at\r\nthe theatre, but contented himself with booking stalls for the variety\r\nperformance that evening.\r\n\r\nThe show was wearisome beyond words\u2014or perhaps it was only my mood that\r\nmade it seem so. Japanese families balanced themselves precariously,\r\nwould-be fashionable men, in greenish evening dress and exquisitely\r\nslicked hair, reeled off society patter and danced marvellously, stout\r\nprima donnas sang at the top of the human register, a comic comedian\r\nendeavoured to be Mr. George Robey and failed signally.\r\n\r\nAt last the number went up which announced the Dulcibella Kids. My\r\nheart beat sickeningly. There she was\u2014there they both were, the pair of\r\nthem, one flaxen haired, one dark, matching as to size, with short\r\nfluffy skirts and immense buster brown bows. They looked a pair of\r\nextremely piquant children. They began to sing. Their voices were fresh\r\nand true, rather thin and music-hally, but attractive.\r\n\r\nIt was quite a pretty little turn. They danced neatly, and did some\r\nclever little acrobatic feats. The words of their songs were crisp and\r\ncatchy. When the curtain fell, there was a full meed of applause.\r\nEvidently the Dulcibella Kids were a success.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I felt that I could remain no longer. I must get out into the\r\nair. I suggested leaving to Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cGo by all means, _mon ami___. I amuse myself, and will stay to the\r\nend. I will rejoin you later.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was only a few steps from the theatre to the hotel. I went up to the\r\nsitting-room, ordered a whisky and soda, and sat drinking it, staring\r\nmeditatively into the empty grate. I heard the door open, and turned my\r\nhead, thinking it was Poirot. Then I jumped to my feet. It was\r\nCinderella who stood in the doorway. She spoke haltingly, her breath\r\ncoming in little gasps.\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw you in front. You and your friend. When you got up to go, I was\r\nwaiting outside and followed you. Why are you here\u2014in Coventry? What\r\nwere you doing there to-night? Is the man who was with you the\u2014the\r\ndetective?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stood there, the cloak she had wrapped round her stage dress\r\nslipping from her shoulders. I saw the whiteness of her cheeks under\r\nthe rouge, and heard the terror in her voice. And in that moment I\r\nunderstood everything\u2014understood why Poirot was seeking her, and what\r\nshe feared, and understood at last my own heart.\u200a\u2026\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said gently.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs he looking for\u2014me?\u201d she half whispered.\r\n\r\nThen, as I did not answer for a moment, she slipped down by the big\r\nchair, and burst into violent, bitter weeping.\r\n\r\nI knelt down by her, holding her in my arms, and smoothing the hair\r\nback from her face.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry, child, don\u2019t cry, for God\u2019s sake. You\u2019re safe here. I\u2019ll\r\ntake care of you. Don\u2019t cry, darling. Don\u2019t cry. I know\u2014I know\r\neverything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, but you don\u2019t!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I do.\u201d And after a moment, as her sobs grew quieter, I asked:\r\n\u201cIt was you who took the dagger, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was why you wanted me to show you round? And why you pretended to\r\nfaint?\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain she nodded. It was a strange thought to come to me at the moment,\r\nbut it shot into my mind that I was glad her motive was what it had\r\nbeen\u2014rather than the idle and morbid curiosity I had accused her of at\r\nthe time. How gallantly she had played her part that day, inwardly\r\nracked with fear and trepidation as she must have been. Poor little\r\nsoul, bearing the burden of a moment\u2019s impetuous action.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you take the dagger?\u201d I asked presently.\r\n\r\nShe replied as simply as a child:\r\n\r\n\u201cI was afraid there might be finger-marks on it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut didn\u2019t you remember that you had worn gloves?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head as though bewildered, and then said slowly:\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you going to give me up to\u2014to the Police?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood God! no.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer eyes sought mine long and earnestly, and then she asked in a little\r\nquiet voice that sounded afraid of itself:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\r\nIt seemed a strange place and a strange time for a declaration of\r\nlove\u2014and God knows, in all my imagining, I had never pictured love\r\ncoming to me in such a guise. But I answered simply and naturally\r\nenough:\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause I love you, Cinderella.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe bent her head down, as though ashamed, and muttered in a broken\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014you can\u2019t\u2014not if you knew\u2014\u201d And then, as though rallying\r\nherself, she faced me squarely, and asked:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you know, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know that you came to see Mr. Renauld that night. He offered you a\r\ncheque and you tore it up indignantly. Then you left the house\u2014\u201d I\r\npaused.\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on\u2014what next?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether you knew that Jack Renauld would be coming that\r\nnight, or whether you just waited about on the chance of seeing him,\r\nbut you did wait about. Perhaps you were just miserable, and walked\r\naimlessly\u2014but at any rate just before twelve you were still near there,\r\nand you saw a man on the golf links\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain I paused. I had leapt to the truth in a flash as she entered the\r\nroom, but now the picture rose before me even more convincingly. I saw\r\nvividly the peculiar pattern of the overcoat on the dead body of Mr.\r\nRenauld, and I remembered the amazing likeness that had startled me\r\ninto believing for one instant that the dead man had risen from the\r\ndead when his son burst into our conclave in the _salon___.\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on,\u201d repeated the girl steadily.\r\n\r\n\u201cI fancy his back was to you\u2014but you recognized him, or thought you\r\nrecognized him. The gait and the carriage were familiar to you, and the\r\npattern of his overcoat.\u201d I paused. \u201cYou told me in the train on the\r\nway from Paris that you had Italian blood in your veins, and that you\r\nhad nearly got into trouble once with it. You used a threat in one of\r\nyour letters to Jack Renauld. When you saw him there, your anger and\r\njealousy drove you mad\u2014and you struck! I don\u2019t believe for a minute\r\nthat you meant to kill him. But you did kill him, Cinderella.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe had flung up her hands to cover her face, and in a choked voice she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right\u200a\u2026 you\u2019re right\u200a\u2026 I can see it all as you tell it.\u201d Then\r\nshe turned on me almost savagely. \u201cAnd you love me? Knowing what you\r\ndo, how can you love me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said a little wearily. \u201cI think love is like that\u2014a\r\nthing one cannot help. I have tried, I know\u2014ever since the first day I\r\nmet you. And love has been too strong for me.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd then suddenly, when I least expected it, she broke down again,\r\ncasting herself down on the floor and sobbing wildly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I can\u2019t!\u201d she cried. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know which\r\nway to turn. Oh, pity me, pity me, some one, and tell me what to do!\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain I knelt by her, soothing her as best I could.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of me, Bella. For God\u2019s sake don\u2019t be afraid of me. I\r\nlove you, that\u2019s true\u2014but I don\u2019t want anything in return. Only let me\r\nhelp you. Love him still if you have to, but let me help you as he\r\ncan\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was as though she had been turned to stone by my words. She raised\r\nher head from her hands and stared at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think that?\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou think that I love Jack Renauld?\u201d\r\n\r\nThen, half laughing, half crying, she flung her arms passionately round\r\nmy neck, and pressed her sweet wet face to mine.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot as I love you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNever as I love you!\u201d\r\n\r\nHer lips brushed my cheek, and then, seeking my mouth, kissed me again\r\nand again with a sweetness and fire beyond belief. The wildness of\r\nit\u2014and the wonder, I shall not forget\u2014no, not as long as I live!\r\n\r\nIt was a sound in the doorway that made us look up. Poirot was standing\r\nthere looking at us.\r\n\r\nI did not hesitate. With a bound I reached him and pinioned his arms to\r\nhis sides.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuick,\u201d I said to the girl. \u201cGet out of here. As fast as you can. I\u2019ll\r\nhold him.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith one look at me, she fled out of the room past us. I held Poirot in\r\na grip of iron.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon ami___,\u201d observed the latter mildly, \u201cyou do this sort of thing\r\nvery well. The strong man holds me in his grasp and I am helpless as a\r\nchild. But all this is uncomfortable and slightly ridiculous. Let us\r\nsit down and be calm.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t pursue her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon Dieu!___ no. Am I Giraud? Release me, my friend.\u201d\r\n\r\nKeeping a suspicious eye upon him, for I paid Poirot the compliment of\r\nknowing that I was no match for him in astuteness, I relaxed my grip,\r\nand he sank into an arm-chair, feeling his arms tenderly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is that you have the strength of a bull when you are roused,\r\nHastings! _Eh bien___, and do you think you have behaved well to your\r\nold friend? I show you the girl\u2019s photograph and you recognize it, but\r\nyou never say a word.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was no need if you knew that I recognized it,\u201d I said rather\r\nbitterly. So Poirot had known all along! I had not deceived him for an\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\n\u201cTa-ta! You did not know that I knew that. And tonight you help the\r\ngirl to escape when we have found her with so much trouble! _Eh\r\nbien!___ it comes to this\u2014are you going to work with me or against me,\r\nHastings?\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment or two I did not answer. To break with my old friend gave\r\nme great pain. Yet I must definitely range myself against him. Would he\r\never forgive me, I wondered? He had been strangely calm so far, but I\r\nknew him to possess marvellous self-command.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I admit I\u2019ve behaved badly to you over\r\nthis. But sometimes one has no choice. And in future I must take my own\r\nline.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded his head several times.\r\n\r\n\u201cI understand,\u201d he said. The mocking light had quite died out of his\r\neyes, and he spoke with a sincerity and kindness that surprised me. \u201cIt\r\nis that, my friend, is it not? It is love that has come\u2014not as you\r\nimagined it, all cock a hoop with fine feathers, but sadly, with\r\nbleeding feet. Well, well\u2014I warned you. When I realized that this girl\r\nmust have taken the dagger, I warned you. Perhaps you remember. But\r\nalready it was too late. But, tell me, how much do you know?\u201d\r\n\r\nI met his eyes squarely.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing that you could tell me would be any surprise to me, Poirot.\r\nUnderstand that. But in case you think of resuming your search for Miss\r\nDuveen, I should like you to know one thing clearly. If you have any\r\nidea that she was concerned in the crime, or was the mysterious lady\r\nwho called upon Mr. Renauld that night, you are wrong. I travelled home\r\nfrom France with her that day, and parted from her at Victoria that\r\nevening so that it is clearly impossible for her to have been in\r\nMerlinville.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d Poirot looked at me thoughtfully. \u201cAnd you would swear to that in\r\na court of law?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMost certainly I would.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot rose and bowed.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon ami! Vive l\u2019amour!___ It can perform miracles. It is decidedly\r\ningenious what you have thought of there. It defeats even Hercule\r\nPoirot!\u201d\r\n\nAfter a moment of stress, such as I have just described, reaction is\r\nbound to set in. I retired to rest that night on a note of triumph, but\r\nI awoke to realize that I was by no means out of the wood. True, I\r\ncould see no flaw in the alibi I had so suddenly conceived. I had but\r\nto stick to my story, and I failed to see how Bella could be convicted\r\nin face of it. It was not as though there was any old friendship\r\nbetween us that could be raked up, and which might lead them to suspect\r\nthat I was committing perjury. It could be proved that in actual fact I\r\nhad only seen the girl on three occasions. No, I was still satisfied\r\nwith my idea\u2014had not even Poirot admitted that it defeated him?\r\n\r\nBut there I felt the need of treading warily. All very well for my\r\nlittle friend to admit himself momentarily nonplussed. I had far too\r\nmuch respect for his abilities to conceive of him as being content to\r\nremain in that position. I had a very humble opinion of my wits when it\r\ncame to matching them against his. Poirot would not take defeat lying\r\ndown. Somehow or other, he would endeavour to turn the tables on me,\r\nand that in the way, and at the moment, when I least expected it.\r\n\r\nWe met at breakfast the following morning as though nothing had\r\nhappened. Poirot\u2019s good temper was imperturbable, yet I thought I\r\ndetected a film of reserve in his manner which was new. After\r\nbreakfast, I announced my intention of going out for a stroll. A\r\nmalicious gleam shot through Poirot\u2019s eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf it is information you seek, you need not be at the pains of\r\nderanging yourself. I can tell you all you wish to know. The Dulcibella\r\nSisters have cancelled their contract, and have left Coventry for an\r\nunknown destination.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that really so, Poirot?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can take it from me, Hastings. I made inquiries the first thing\r\nthis morning. After all, what else did you expect?\u201d\r\n\r\nTrue enough, nothing else could be expected under the circumstances.\r\nCinderella had profited by the slight start I had been able to assure\r\nher, and would certainly not lose a moment in removing herself from the\r\nreach of the pursuer. It was what I had intended and planned.\r\nNevertheless, I was aware of being plunged into a network of fresh\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nI had absolutely no means of communicating with the girl, and it was\r\nvital that she should know the line of defence that had occurred to me,\r\nand which I was prepared to carry out. Of course it was possible that\r\nshe might try to send word to me in some way or another, but I hardly\r\nthought it likely. She would know the risk she ran of a message being\r\nintercepted by Poirot, thus setting him on her track once more. Clearly\r\nher only course was to disappear utterly for the time being.\r\n\r\nBut, in the meantime, what was Poirot doing? I studied him attentively.\r\nHe was wearing his most innocent air, and staring meditatively into the\r\nfar distance. He looked altogether too placid and supine to give me\r\nreassurance. I had learned, with Poirot, that the less dangerous he\r\nlooked, the more dangerous he was. His quiescence alarmed me. Observing\r\na troubled quality in my glance, he smiled benignantly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are puzzled, Hastings? You ask yourself why I do not launch myself\r\nin pursuit?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell\u2014something of the kind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is what you would do, were you in my place. I understand that. But\r\nI am not of those who enjoy rushing up and down a country seeking a\r\nneedle in a haystack, as you English say. No\u2014let Mademoiselle Bella\r\nDuveen go. Without doubt, I shall be able to find her when the time\r\ncomes. Until then, I am content to wait.\u201d\r\n\r\nI stared at him doubtfully. Was he seeking to mislead me? I had an\r\nirritating feeling that, even now, he was master of the situation. My\r\nsense of superiority was gradually waning. I had contrived the girl\u2019s\r\nescape, and evolved a brilliant scheme for saving her from the\r\nconsequences of her rash act\u2014but I could not rest easy in my mind.\r\nPoirot\u2019s perfect calm awakened a thousand apprehensions.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose, Poirot,\u201d I said rather diffidently, \u201cI mustn\u2019t ask what\r\nyour plans are? I\u2019ve forfeited the right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut not at all. There is no secret about them. We return to France\r\nwithout delay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_We?___\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely\u2014\u2018_we!___\u2019 You know very well that you cannot afford to let\r\nPapa Poirot out of your sight. Eh, is it not so, my friend? But remain\r\nin England by all means if you wish\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head. He had hit the nail on the head. I could not afford to\r\nlet him out of my sight. Although I could not expect his confidence\r\nafter what had happened, I could still check his actions. The only\r\ndanger to Bella lay with him. Giraud and the French police were\r\nindifferent to her existence. At all costs I must keep near Poirot.\r\n\r\nPoirot observed me attentively as these reflections passed through my\r\nmind, and gave a nod of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am right, am I not? And as you are quite capable of trying to follow\r\nme, disguised with some absurdity such as a false beard\u2014which every one\r\nwould perceive, _bien entendu___\u2014I much prefer that we should voyage\r\ntogether. It would annoy me greatly that any one should mock themselves\r\nat you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, then. But it\u2019s only fair to warn you\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know\u2014I know all. You are my enemy! Be my enemy then. It does not\r\nworry me at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo long as it\u2019s all fair and above-board, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have to the full the English passion for \u2018fair-play!\u2019 Now your\r\nscruples are satisfied, let us depart immediately. There is no time to\r\nbe lost. Our stay in England has been short but sufficient. I know\u2014what\r\nI wanted to know.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe tone was light, but I read a veiled menace into the words.\r\n\r\n\u201cStill\u2014\u201d I began, and stopped.\r\n\r\n\u201cStill\u2014as you say! Without doubt you are satisfied with the part you\r\nare playing. Me, I preoccupy myself with Jack Renauld.\u201d\r\n\r\nJack Renauld! The words gave me a start. I had completely forgotten\r\nthat aspect of the case. Jack Renauld, in prison, with the shadow of\r\nthe guillotine looming over him! I saw the part I was playing in a more\r\nsinister light. I could save Bella\u2014yes, but in doing so I ran the risk\r\nof sending an innocent man to his death.\r\n\r\nI pushed the thought from me with horror. It could not be. He would be\r\nacquitted. Certainly he would be acquitted! But the cold fear came\r\nback. Suppose he were not? What then? Could I have it on my\r\nconscience\u2014horrible thought! Would it come to that in the end? A\r\ndecision. Bella or Jack Renauld? The promptings of my heart were to\r\nsave the girl I loved at any cost to myself. But, if the cost were to\r\nanother, the problem was altered.\r\n\r\nWhat would the girl herself say? I remembered that no word of Jack\r\nRenauld\u2019s arrest had passed my lips. As yet she was in total ignorance\r\nof the fact that her former lover was in prison charged with a hideous\r\ncrime which he had not committed. When she knew, how would she act?\r\nWould she permit her life to be saved at the expense of his? Certainly\r\nshe must do nothing rash. Jack Renauld might, and probably would, be\r\nacquitted without any intervention on her part. If so, good. But if he\r\nwas not.\u200a\u2026 That was the terrible, the unanswerable problem. I fancied\r\nthat she ran no risk of the extreme penalty. The circumstances of the\r\ncrime were quite different in her case. She could plead jealousy and\r\nextreme provocation, and her youth and beauty would go for much. The\r\nfact that by a tragic mistake it was old Mr. Renauld, and not his son,\r\nwho paid the penalty would not alter the motive of the crime. But in\r\nany case, however lenient the sentence of the Court, it must mean a\r\nlong term of imprisonment.\r\n\r\nNo, Bella must be protected. And, at the same time, Jack Renauld must\r\nbe saved. How this was to be accomplished I did not see clearly. But I\r\npinned my faith to Poirot. He knew. Come what might, he would manage to\r\nsave an innocent man. He must find some pretext other than the real\r\none. It might be difficult, but he would manage it somehow. And with\r\nBella unsuspected, and Jack Renauld acquitted, all would end\r\nsatisfactorily.\r\n\r\nSo I told myself repeatedly, but at the bottom of my heart there still\r\nremained a cold fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24 \u201cSave Him!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe crossed from England by the evening boat, and the following morning\r\nsaw us in Saint-Omer, whither Jack Renauld had been taken. Poirot lost\r\nno time in visiting M. Hautet. As he did not seem disposed to make any\r\nobjections to my accompanying him, I bore him company.\r\n\r\nAfter various formalities and preliminaries, we were conducted to the\r\nexamining magistrate\u2019s room. He greeted us cordially.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was told that you had returned to England, M. Poirot. I am glad to\r\nfind that such is not the case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is true that I went there, M. le juge, but it was only for a flying\r\nvisit. A side issue, but one that I fancied might repay investigation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd it did\u2014eh?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders. M. Hautet nodded, sighing.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must resign ourselves, I fear. That animal Giraud, his manners are\r\nabominable, but he is undoubtedly clever! Not much chance of that one\r\nmaking a mistake.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think not, M. le juge?\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was the examining magistrate\u2019s turn to shrug his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien___, speaking frankly\u2014in confidence, _c\u2019est entendu___\u2014can you\r\ncome to any other conclusion?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrankly, M. le juge, there seem to me to be many points that are\r\nobscure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuch as\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Poirot was not to be drawn.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have not yet tabulated them,\u201d he remarked. \u201cIt was a general\r\nreflection that I was making. I liked the young man, and should be\r\nsorry to believe him guilty of such a hideous crime. By the way, what\r\nhas he to say for himself on the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe magistrate frowned.\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot understand him. He seems incapable of putting up any sort of\r\ndefence. It has been most difficult to get him to answer questions. He\r\ncontents himself with a general denial, and beyond that takes refuge in\r\na most obstinate silence. I am interrogating him again tomorrow;\r\nperhaps you would like to be present?\u201d\r\n\r\nWe accepted the invitation with _empressement___.\r\n\r\n\u201cA distressing case,\u201d said the magistrate with a sigh. \u201cMy sympathy for\r\nMadame Renauld is profound.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow is Madame Renauld?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe has not yet recovered consciousness. It is merciful in a way, poor\r\nwoman, she is being spared much. The doctors say that there is no\r\ndanger, but that when she comes to herself she must be kept as quiet as\r\npossible. It was, I understand, quite as much the shock as the fall\r\nwhich caused her present state. It would be terrible if her brain\r\nbecame unhinged; but I should not wonder at all\u2014no, really, not at\r\nall.\u201d\r\n\r\nM. Hautet leaned back, shaking his head, with a sort of mournful\r\nenjoyment, as he envisaged the gloomy prospect.\r\n\r\nHe roused himself at length, and observed with a start.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat reminds me. I have here a letter for you, M. Poirot. Let me see,\r\nwhere did I put it?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to rummage amongst his papers. At last he found the\r\nmissive, and handed it to Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was sent under cover to me in order that I might forward it to\r\nyou,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut as you left no address I could not do so.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot studied the letter curiously. It was addressed in a long,\r\nsloping, foreign hand, and the writing was decidedly a woman\u2019s. Poirot\r\ndid not open it. Instead he put it in his pocket and rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n\u201c_A demain___ then, M. le juge. Many thanks for your courtesy and\r\namiability.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut not at all. I am always at your service. These young detectives of\r\nthe school of Giraud, they are all alike\u2014rude, sneering fellows. They\r\ndo not realize that an examining magistrate of my\u2014er\u2014experience is\r\nbound to have a certain discernment, a certain\u2014_flair___. _Enfin!___\r\nthe politeness of the old school is infinitely more to my taste.\r\nTherefore, my dear friend, command me in any way you will. We know a\r\nthing or two, you and I\u2014eh?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd laughing heartily, enchanted with himself and with us, M. Hautet\r\nbade us adieu. I am sorry to have to record that Poirot\u2019s first remark\r\nto me as we traversed the corridor was:\r\n\r\n\u201cA famous old imbecile, that one! Of a stupidity to make pity!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe were just leaving the building when we came face to face with\r\nGiraud, looking more dandified than ever, and thoroughly pleased with\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\u201cAha! M. Poirot,\u201d he cried airily. \u201cYou have returned from England\r\nthen?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs you see,\u201d said Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe end of the case is not far off now, I fancy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI agree with you, M. Giraud.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot spoke in a subdued tone. His crest-fallen manner seemed to\r\ndelight the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf all the milk and water criminals! Not an idea of defending himself.\r\nIt is extraordinary!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo extraordinary that it gives one to think, does it not?\u201d suggested\r\nPoirot mildly.\r\n\r\nBut Giraud was not even listening. He twirled his cane amicably.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, good day, M. Poirot. I am glad you\u2019re satisfied of young\r\nRenauld\u2019s guilt at last.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Pardon!___ But I am not in the least satisfied. Jack Renauld is\r\ninnocent.\u201d\r\n\r\nGiraud stared for a moment\u2014then burst out laughing, tapping his head\r\nsignificantly with the brief remark: \u201c_Toqu\u00e9!___\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot drew himself up. A dangerous light showed in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cM. Giraud, throughout the case your manner to me has been deliberately\r\ninsulting! You need teaching a lesson. I am prepared to wager you 500\r\nfrancs that I find the murderer of M. Renauld before you do. Is it\r\nagreed?\u201d\r\n\r\nGiraud stared helplessly at him, and murmured again:\r\n\r\n\u201c_Toqu\u00e9!___\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome now,\u201d urged Poirot, \u201cis it agreed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no wish to take your money from you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMake your mind easy\u2014you will not!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, well then, I agree! You speak of my manner to you being insulting.\r\n_Eh bien___, once or twice, _your___ manner has annoyed _me___.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am enchanted to hear it,\u201d said Poirot. \u201cGood morning, M. Giraud.\r\nCome, Hastings.\u201d\r\n\r\nI said no word as we walked along the street. My heart was heavy.\r\nPoirot had displayed his intentions only too plainly. I doubted more\r\nthan ever my powers of saving Bella from the consequences of her act.\r\nThis unlucky encounter with Giraud had roused Poirot and put him on his\r\nmettle.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I felt a hand laid on my shoulder, and turned to face Gabriel\r\nStonor. We stopped and greeted him, and he proposed strolling with us\r\nback to our hotel.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what are you doing here, M. Stonor?\u201d inquired Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne must stand by one\u2019s friends,\u201d replied the other dryly. \u201cEspecially\r\nwhen they are unjustly accused.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you do not believe that Jack Renauld committed the crime?\u201d I\r\nasked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly I don\u2019t. I know the lad. I admit that there have been one or\r\ntwo things in this business that have staggered me completely, but none\r\nthe less, in spite of his fool way of taking it, I\u2019ll never believe\r\nthat Jack Renauld is a murderer.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy heart warmed to the secretary. His words seemed to lift a secret\r\nweight from my heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no doubt that many people feel as you do,\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cThere\r\nis really absurdly little evidence against him. I should say that there\r\nwas no doubt of his acquittal\u2014no doubt whatever.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Stonor hardly responded as I could have wished.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d give a lot to think as you do,\u201d he said gravely. He turned to\r\nPoirot. \u201cWhat\u2019s your opinion, monsieur?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that things look very black against him,\u201d said Poirot quietly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou believe him guilty?\u201d said Stonor sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. But I think he will find it hard to prove his innocence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s behaving so damned queerly,\u201d muttered Stonor. \u201cOf course I\r\nrealize that there\u2019s a lot more in this affair than meets the eye.\r\nGiraud\u2019s not wise to that because he\u2019s an outsider, but the whole thing\r\nhas been damned odd. As to that, least said soonest mended. If Mrs.\r\nRenauld wants to hush anything up, I\u2019ll take my cue from her. It\u2019s her\r\nshow, and I\u2019ve too much respect for her judgment to shove my oar in,\r\nbut I can\u2019t get behind this attitude of Jack\u2019s. Any one would think he\r\n_wanted___ to be thought guilty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s absurd,\u201d I cried, bursting in. \u201cFor one thing, the dagger\u2014\u201d I\r\npaused, uncertain as to how much Poirot would wish me to reveal. I\r\ncontinued, choosing my words carefully, \u201cWe know that the dagger could\r\nnot have been in Jack Renauld\u2019s possession that evening. Mrs. Renauld\r\nknows that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue,\u201d said Stonor. \u201cWhen she recovers, she will doubtless say all\r\nthis and more. Well, I must be leaving you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne moment.\u201d Poirot\u2019s hand arrested his departure. \u201cCan you arrange\r\nfor word to be sent to me at once should Madame Renauld recover\r\nconsciousness?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. That\u2019s easily done.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat point about the dagger is good, Poirot,\u201d I urged as we went\r\nupstairs. \u201cI couldn\u2019t speak very plainly before Stonor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was quite right of you. We might as well keep the knowledge to\r\nourselves as long as we can. As to the dagger, your point hardly helps\r\nJack Renauld. You remember that I was absent for an hour this morning,\r\nbefore we started from London?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I was employed in trying to find the firm Jack Renauld employed\r\nto convert his souvenirs. It was not very difficult. _Eh bien___,\r\nHastings, they made to his order not _two___ paper-knives, but\r\n_three___.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo that\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo that, after giving one to his mother, and one to Bella Duveen,\r\nthere was a third which he doubtless retained for his own use. No,\r\nHastings, I fear the dagger question will not help us to save him from\r\nthe guillotine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt won\u2019t come to that,\u201d I cried, stung.\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head uncertainly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will save him,\u201d I cried positively.\r\n\r\nPoirot glanced at me dryly.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you not rendered it impossible, _mon ami?___\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome other way,\u201d I muttered.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! _Sapristi!___ But it is miracles you ask from me. No\u2014say no more.\r\nLet us instead see what is in this letter.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd he drew out the envelope from his breast pocket.\r\n\r\nHis face contracted as he read, then he handed the one flimsy sheet to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are other women in the world who suffer, Hastings.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe writing was blurred and the note had evidently been written in\r\ngreat agitation:\r\n\r\n\u201c_Dear M. Poirot:___\r\n\u201cIf you get this, I beg of you to come to my aid. I have no one to turn\r\nto, and at all costs Jack must be saved. I implore of you on my knees\r\nto help us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cMARTHE DAUBREUIL.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nI handed it back, moved.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will go?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt once. We will command an auto.\u201d\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later saw us at the Villa Marguerite. Marthe was at the\r\ndoor to meet us, and led Poirot in, clinging with both hands to one of\r\nhis.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, you have come\u2014it is good of you. I have been in despair, not\r\nknowing what to do. They will not let me go to see him in prison even.\r\nI suffer horribly, I am nearly mad. Is it true what they say, that he\r\ndoes not deny the crime? But that is madness. It is impossible that he\r\nshould have done it! Never for one minute will I believe it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNeither do I believe it, mademoiselle,\u201d said Poirot gently.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut then why does he not speak? I do not understand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps because he is screening some one,\u201d suggested Poirot, watching\r\nher.\r\n\r\nMarthe frowned.\r\n\r\n\u201cScreening some one? Do you mean his mother? Ah, from the beginning I\r\nhave suspected her. Who inherits all that vast fortune? She does. It is\r\neasy to wear widow\u2019s weeds and play the hypocrite. And they say that\r\nwhen he was arrested she fell down\u2014like _that___.\u201d She made a dramatic\r\ngesture. \u201cAnd without doubt, M. Stonor, the secretary, he helped her.\r\nThey are thick as thieves, those two. It is true she is older than\r\nhe\u2014but what do men care\u2014if a woman is rich!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a hint of bitterness in her tone.\r\n\r\n\u201cStonor was in England,\u201d I put in.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe says so\u2014but who knows?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMademoiselle,\u201d said Poirot quietly, \u201cif we are to work together, you\r\nand I, we must have things clear. First, I will ask you a question.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, monsieur?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you aware of your mother\u2019s real name?\u201d\r\n\r\nMarthe looked at him for a minute, then, letting her head fall forward\r\non her arms, she burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, there,\u201d said Poirot, patting her on the shoulder. \u201cCalm\r\nyourself, _petite___, I see that you know. Now a second question, did\r\nyou know who M. Renauld was?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cM. Renauld,\u201d she raised her head from her hands and gazed at him\r\nwonderingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, I see you do not know that. Now listen to me carefully.\u201d\r\n\r\nStep by step, he went over the case, much as he had done to me on the\r\nday of our departure for England. Marthe listened spellbound. When he\r\nhad finished, she drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you are wonderful\u2014magnificent! You are the greatest detective in\r\nthe world.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a swift gesture she slipped off her chair and knelt before him\r\nwith an abandonment that was wholly French.\r\n\r\n\u201cSave him, monsieur,\u201d she cried. \u201cI love him so. Oh, save him, save\r\nhim\u2014save him!\u201d\r\n\nWe were present the following morning at the examination of Jack\r\nRenauld. Short as the time had been, I was shocked at the change that\r\nhad taken place in the young prisoner. His cheeks had fallen in, there\r\nwere deep black circles round his eyes, and he looked haggard and\r\ndistraught, as one who had wooed sleep in vain for several nights. He\r\nbetrayed no emotion at seeing us.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner and his counsel, Ma\u00eetre Gros\u00eder, were accommodated with\r\nchairs. A formidable guard with resplendent sabre stood before the\r\ndoor. The patient _greffier___ sat at his desk. The examination began.\r\n\r\n\u201cRenauld,\u201d began the magistrate, \u201cdo you deny that you were in\r\nMerlinville on the night of the crime?\u201d\r\n\r\nJack did not reply at once, then he said with a hesitancy of manner\r\nwhich was piteous:\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2014told you that I was in Cherbourg.\u201d\r\n\r\nMa\u00eetre Gros\u00eder frowned and sighed. I realized at once that Jack Renauld\r\nwas obstinately bent on conducting his own case as he wished, to the\r\ndespair of his legal representative.\r\n\r\nThe magistrate turned sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cSend in the station witnesses.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn a moment or two the door opened to admit a man whom I recognized as\r\nbeing a porter at Merlinville station.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were on duty on the night of June 7th?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou witnessed the arrival of the 11:40 train?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLook at the prisoner. Do you recognize him as having been one of the\r\npassengers to alight?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Monsieur le juge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no possibility of your being mistaken?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, monsieur. I knew M. Jack Renauld well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor of your being mistaken as to the date?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, monsieur. Because it was the following morning, June 8th, that we\r\nheard of the murder.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother railway official was brought in, and confirmed the first one\u2019s\r\nevidence. The magistrate looked at Jack Renauld.\r\n\r\n\u201cThese men have identified you positively. What have you to say?\u201d\r\n\r\nJack shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\r\n\r\nM. Hautet exchanged a glance with the _greffier___, as the scratching\r\nof the latter\u2019s pen recorded the answer.\r\n\r\n\u201cRenauld,\u201d continued the magistrate, \u201cdo you recognize this?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe took something from the table by his side, and held it out to the\r\nprisoner. I shuddered as I recognized the aeroplane dagger.\r\n\r\n\u201cPardon,\u201d cried Ma\u00eetre Gros\u00eder. \u201cI demand to speak to my client before\r\nhe answers that question.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Jack Renauld had no consideration for the feelings of the wretched\r\nGros\u00eder. He waved him aside, and replied quietly:\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly I recognize it. It is a present given by me to my mother, as\r\na souvenir of the War.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs there, as far as you know, any duplicate of that dagger in\r\nexistence?\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain Ma\u00eetre Gros\u00eder burst out, and again Jack overrode him.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot that I know of. The setting was my own design.\u201d\r\n\r\nEven the magistrate almost gasped at the boldness of the reply. It did,\r\nin very truth, seem as though Jack was rushing on his fate. I realized,\r\nof course, the vital necessity he was under of concealing, for Bella\u2019s\r\nsake, the fact that there was a duplicate dagger in the case. So long\r\nas there was supposed to be only one weapon, no suspicion was likely to\r\nattach to the girl who had had the second paper-knife in her\r\npossession. He was valiantly shielding the woman he had once loved\u2014but\r\nat what a cost to himself! I began to realize the magnitude of the task\r\nI had so lightly set Poirot. It would not be easy to secure the\r\nacquittal of Jack Renauld, by anything short of the truth.\r\n\r\nM. Hautet spoke again, with a peculiarly biting inflection:\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame Renauld told us that this dagger was on her dressing table on\r\nthe night of the crime. But Madame Renauld is a mother! It will\r\ndoubtless astonish you, Renauld, but I consider it highly likely that\r\nMadame Renauld was mistaken, and that, by inadvertence perhaps, you had\r\ntaken it with you to Paris. Doubtless you will contradict me\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nI saw the lad\u2019s handcuffed hands clench themselves. The perspiration\r\nstood out in beads upon his brow, as with a supreme effort he\r\ninterrupted M. Hautet in a hoarse voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall not contradict you. It is possible.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a stupefying moment. Ma\u00eetre Gros\u00eder rose to his feet,\r\nprotesting:\r\n\r\n\u201cMy client has undergone a considerable nervous strain. I should wish\r\nit put on record that I do not consider him answerable for what he\r\nsays.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe magistrate quelled him angrily. For a moment a doubt seemed to\r\narise in his own mind. Jack Renauld had almost overdone his part. He\r\nleaned forward, and gazed at the prisoner searchingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you fully understand, Renauld, that on the answers you have given\r\nme I shall have no alternative but to commit you for trial?\u201d\r\n\r\nJack\u2019s pale face flushed. He looked steadily back.\r\n\r\n\u201cM. Hautet, I swear that I did not kill my father.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the magistrate\u2019s brief moment of doubt was over. He laughed a\r\nshort, unpleasant laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201cWithout doubt, without doubt\u2014they are always innocent, our prisoners!\r\nBy your own mouth you are condemned. You can offer no defence, no\r\nalibi\u2014only a mere assertion which would not deceive a babe!\u2014that you\r\nare not guilty. You killed your father, Renauld\u2014cruel and cowardly\r\nmurder\u2014for the sake of money which you believed would come to you at\r\nhis death. Your mother was an accessory after the fact. Doubtless, in\r\nview of the fact that she acted as a mother, the courts will extend an\r\nindulgence to her that they will not accord to you. And rightly so!\r\nYour crime was a horrible one\u2014to be held in abhorrence by gods and\r\nmen!\u201d M. Hautet was enjoying himself, working up his period, steeped in\r\nthe solemnity of the moment, and his own role as representative of\r\njustice. \u201cYou killed\u2014and you must pay the consequences of your action.\r\nI speak to you, not as a man, but as Justice, eternal Justice, which\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nM. Hautet was interrupted\u2014to his intense annoyance. The door was pushed\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n\u201cM. le juge, M. le juge,\u201d stammered the attendant, \u201cthere is a lady who\r\nsays\u2014who says\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho says what?\u201d cried the justly incensed magistrate. \u201cThis is highly\r\nirregular. I forbid it\u2014I absolutely forbid it.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut a slender figure pushed the stammering gendarme aside. Dressed all\r\nin black, with a long veil that hid her face, she advanced into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nMy heart gave a sickening throb. She had come then! All my efforts were\r\nin vain. Yet I could not but admire the courage that had led her to\r\ntake this step so unfalteringly.\r\n\r\nShe raised her veil\u2014and I gasped. For, though as like her as two peas,\r\nthis girl was not Cinderella! On the other hand, now that I saw her\r\nwithout the fair wig she had worn on the stage, I recognized her as the\r\ngirl of the photograph in Jack Renauld\u2019s room.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are the Juge d\u2019Instruction, M. Hautet?\u201d she queried.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but I forbid\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name is Bella Duveen. I wish to give myself up for the murder of\r\nMr. Renauld.\u201d\r\n\n\u201c_My Friend:___\r\n    \u201cYou will know all when you get this. Nothing that I can say will\r\n    move Bella. She has gone out to give herself up. I am tired out\r\n    with struggling.\r\n    \u201cYou will know now that I deceived you, that where you gave me\r\n    trust I repaid you with lies. It will seem, perhaps, indefensible\r\n    to you, but I should like, before I go out of your life for ever,\r\n    to show you just how it all came about. If I knew that you forgave\r\n    me, it would make life easier for me. It wasn\u2019t for myself I did\r\n    it\u2014that\u2019s the only thing I can put forward to say for myself.\r\n    \u201cI\u2019ll begin from the day I met you in the boat train from Paris. I\r\n    was uneasy then about Bella. She was just desperate about Jack\r\n    Renauld, she\u2019d have lain down on the ground for him to walk on, and\r\n    when he began to change, and to stop writing so often, she began\r\n    getting in a state. She got it into her head that he was keen on\r\n    another girl\u2014and of course, as it turned out afterwards, she was\r\n    quite right there. She\u2019d made up her mind to go to their Villa at\r\n    Merlinville, and try and see Jack. She knew I was against it, and\r\n    tried to give me the slip. I found she was not on the train at\r\n    Calais, and determined I would not go on to England without her.\r\n    I\u2019d an uneasy feeling that something awful was going to happen if I\r\n    couldn\u2019t prevent it.\r\n    \u201cI met the next train from Paris. She was on it, and set upon going\r\n    out then and there to Merlinville. I argued with her for all I was\r\n    worth, but it wasn\u2019t any good. She was all strung up and set upon\r\n    having her own way. Well, I washed my hands of it. I\u2019d done all I\r\n    could! It was getting late. I went to an hotel, and Bella started\r\n    for Merlinville. I still couldn\u2019t shake off my feeling of what the\r\n    books call \u2018impending disaster.\u2019\r\n    \u201cThe next day came\u2014but no Bella. She\u2019d made a date with me to meet\r\n    at the hotel, but she didn\u2019t keep it. No sign of her all day. I got\r\n    more and more anxious. Then came an evening paper with the news.\r\n    \u201cIt was awful! I couldn\u2019t be sure, of course\u2014but I was terribly\r\n    afraid. I figured it out that Bella had met Papa Renauld and told\r\n    him about her and Jack, and that he\u2019d insulted her or something\r\n    like that. We\u2019ve both got terribly quick tempers.\r\n    \u201cThen all the masked foreigner business came out, and I began to\r\n    feel more at ease. But it still worried me that Bella hadn\u2019t kept\r\n    her date with me.\r\n    \u201cBy the next morning, I was so rattled that I\u2019d just got to go and\r\n    see what I could. First thing, I ran up against you. You know all\r\n    that\u200a\u2026 When I saw the dead man, looking so like Jack, and wearing\r\n    Jack\u2019s fancy overcoat, I knew! And there was the identical\r\n    paper-knife\u2014wicked little thing!\u2014that Jack had given Bella! Ten to\r\n    one it had her finger-marks on it. I can\u2019t hope to explain to you\r\n    the sort of helpless horror of that moment. I only saw one thing\r\n    clearly\u2014I must get hold of that dagger, and get right away with it\r\n    before they found out it was gone. I pretended to faint, and whilst\r\n    you were away getting water I took the thing and hid it away in my\r\n    dress.\r\n    \u201cI told you that I was staying at the H\u00f4tel du Phare, but of course\r\n    really I made a bee line back to Calais, and then on to England by\r\n    the first boat. When we were in mid-Channel, I dropped that little\r\n    devil of a dagger into the sea. Then I felt I could breathe again.\r\n    \u201cBella was at our digs in London. She looked like nothing on God\u2019s\r\n    earth. I told her what I\u2019d done, and that she was pretty safe for\r\n    the time being. She stared at me, and then began laughing\u200a\u2026\r\n    laughing\u200a\u2026 laughing\u200a\u2026 it was horrible to hear her! I felt that the\r\n    best thing to do was to keep busy. She\u2019d go mad if she had time to\r\n    brood on what she\u2019d done. Luckily we got an engagement at once.\r\n    \u201cAnd then, I saw you and your friend, watching us that night\u200a\u2026 I\r\n    was frantic. You must suspect, or you wouldn\u2019t have tracked us\r\n    down. I had to know the worst, so I followed you. I was desperate.\r\n    And then, before I\u2019d had time to say anything, I tumbled to it that\r\n    it was _me___ you suspected, not Bella! Or at least that you\r\n    thought I _was___ Bella since I\u2019d stolen the dagger.\r\n    \u201cI wish, honey, that you could see back into my mind at that\r\n    moment\u200a\u2026 you\u2019d forgive me, perhaps\u200a\u2026 I was so frightened, and\r\n    muddled, and desperate.\u200a\u2026 All I could get clearly was that you\r\n    would try and save me. I didn\u2019t know whether you\u2019d be willing to\r\n    save her\u200a\u2026 I thought very likely not\u2014it wasn\u2019t the same thing! And\r\n    I couldn\u2019t risk it! Bella\u2019s my twin\u2014I\u2019d got to do the best for her.\r\n    So I went on lying.\u200a\u2026 I felt mean\u2014I feel mean still.\u200a\u2026 That\u2019s\r\n    all\u2014enough too, you\u2019ll say, I expect. I ought to have trusted\r\n    you.\u200a\u2026 If I had\u2014\r\n    \u201cAs soon as the news was in the paper that Jack Renauld had been\r\n    arrested, it was all up. Bella wouldn\u2019t even wait to see how things\r\n    went.\u200a\u2026\r\n    \u201cI\u2019m very tired.\u200a\u2026 I can\u2019t write any more.\u200a\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had begun to sign herself Cinderella, but had crossed that out and\r\nwritten instead \u201cDulcie Duveen.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was an ill-written, blurred epistle but I have kept it to this day.\r\n\r\nPoirot was with me when I read it. The sheets fell from my hand, and I\r\nlooked across at him.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you know all the time that it was\u2014the other?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, my friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you not tell me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo begin with, I could hardly believe it conceivable that you could\r\nmake such a mistake. You had seen the photograph. The sisters are very\r\nalike, but by no means incapable of distinguishment.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the fair hair?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA wig, worn for the sake of a piquant contrast on the stage. Is it\r\nconceivable that with twins one should be fair and one dark?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that night at the hotel in Coventry?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were rather high-handed in your methods, _mon ami___,\u201d said Poirot\r\ndryly. \u201cYou did not give me a chance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut afterwards?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, afterwards! Well, to begin with, I was hurt at your want of faith\r\nin me. And then, I wanted to see whether your\u2014feelings would stand the\r\ntest of time. In fact, whether it was love, or a flash in the pan, with\r\nyou. I should not have left you long in your error.\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded. His tone was too affectionate for me to bear resentment. I\r\nlooked down on the sheets of the letter. Suddenly I picked them up from\r\nthe floor, and pushed them across to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cRead that,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019d like you to.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe read it through in silence, then he looked up at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it that worries you, Hastings?\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was quite a new mood in Poirot. His mocking manner seemed laid\r\nquite aside. I was able to say what I wanted without too much\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t say\u2014she doesn\u2019t say\u2014well, not whether she cares for me or\r\nnot!\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot turned back the pages.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think you are mistaken, Hastings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d I cried, leaning forward eagerly.\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe tells you that in every line of the letter, _mon ami___.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut where am I to find her? There\u2019s no address on the letter. There\u2019s\r\na French stamp, that\u2019s all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcite yourself not! Leave it to Papa Poirot. I can find her for you\r\nas soon as I have five little minutes!\u201d\r\n\n\u201cCongratulations, M. Jack,\u201d said Poirot, wringing the lad warmly by the\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nYoung Renauld had come to us as soon as he was liberated\u2014before\r\nstarting for Merlinville to rejoin Marthe and his mother. Stonor\r\naccompanied him. His heartiness was in strong contrast to the lad\u2019s wan\r\nlooks. It was plain that the boy was on the verge of a nervous\r\nbreakdown. Although delivered from the immediate peril that was hanging\r\nover him, the circumstances of his release were too painful to let him\r\nfeel full relief. He smiled mournfully at Poirot, and said in a low\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\u201cI went through it to protect her, and now it\u2019s all no use!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou could hardly expect the girl to accept the price of your life,\u201d\r\nremarked Stonor dryly. \u201cShe was bound to come forward when she saw you\r\nheading straight for the guillotine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh ma foi!___ and you were heading for it too!\u201d added Poirot, with a\r\nslight twinkle. \u201cYou would have had Ma\u00eetre Gros\u00eder\u2019s death from rage on\r\nyour conscience if you had gone on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was a well meaning ass, I suppose,\u201d said Jack. \u201cBut he worried me\r\nhorribly. You see, I couldn\u2019t very well take him into my confidence.\r\nBut, my God! what\u2019s going to happen about Bella?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf I were you,\u201d said Poirot frankly, \u201cI should not distress myself\r\nunduly. The French Courts are very lenient to youth and beauty, and the\r\n_crime passionnel___. A clever lawyer will make out a great case of\r\nextenuating circumstances. It will not be pleasant for you\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about that. You see, M. Poirot, in a way I _do___ feel\r\nguilty of my father\u2019s murder. But for me, and my entanglement with this\r\ngirl, he would be alive and well today. And then my cursed carelessness\r\nin taking away the wrong overcoat. I can\u2019t help feeling responsible for\r\nhis death. It will haunt me for ever!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d I said soothingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s horrible to me to think that Bella killed my father,\u201d\r\nresumed Jack, \u201cbut I\u2019d treated her shamefully. After I met Marthe, and\r\nrealized I\u2019d made a mistake, I ought to have written and told her so\r\nhonestly. But I was so terrified of a row, and of its coming to\r\nMarthe\u2019s ears, and her thinking there was more in it than there ever\r\nhad been, that\u2014well, I was a coward, and went on hoping the thing would\r\ndie down of itself. I just drifted, in fact\u2014not realizing that I was\r\ndriving the poor kid desperate. If she\u2019d really knifed me, as she meant\r\nto, I should have got no more than my deserts. And the way she\u2019s come\r\nforward now is downright plucky. I\u2019d have stood the racket, you know\u2014up\r\nto the end.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a moment or two, and then burst out on another tack:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat gets me is why the Governor should be wandering about in\r\nunderclothes and my overcoat at that time of night. I suppose he\u2019d just\r\ngiven the foreign johnnies the slip, and my mother must have made a\r\nmistake about its being 2 o\u2019clock when they came. Or\u2014or, it wasn\u2019t all\r\na frame up, was it? I mean, my mother didn\u2019t think\u2014couldn\u2019t\r\nthink\u2014that\u2014that it was _me?___\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot reassured him quickly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, M. Jack. Have no fears on that score. As for the rest, I will\r\nexplain it to you one of these days. It is rather curious. But will you\r\nrecount to us exactly what did occur on that terrible evening?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s very little to tell. I came from Cherbourg, as I told you, in\r\norder to see Marthe before going to the other end of the world. The\r\ntrain was late, and I decided to take the short cut across the golf\r\nlinks. I could easily get into the grounds of the Villa Marguerite from\r\nthere. I had nearly reached the place when\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nHe paused and swallowed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI heard a terrible cry. It wasn\u2019t loud\u2014a sort of choke and gasp\u2014but it\r\nfrightened me. For a moment I stood rooted to the spot. Then I came\r\nround the corner of a bush. There was moonlight. I saw the grave, and a\r\nfigure lying face downwards, with a dagger sticking in the back. And\r\nthen\u2014and then\u2014I looked up and saw _her___. She was looking at me as\r\nthough she saw a ghost\u2014it\u2019s what she must have thought me at first\u2014all\r\nexpression seemed frozen out of her face by horror. And then she gave a\r\ncry, and turned and ran.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, trying to master his emotion.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd afterwards?\u201d asked Poirot gently.\r\n\r\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know. I stayed there for a time, dazed. And then I\r\nrealized I\u2019d better get away as fast as I could. It didn\u2019t occur to me\r\nthat they would suspect me, but I was afraid of being called upon to\r\ngive evidence against her. I walked to St. Beauvais as I told you, and\r\ngot a car from there back to Cherbourg.\u201d\r\n\r\nA knock came at the door, and a page entered with a telegram which he\r\ndelivered to Stonor. He tore it open. Then he got up from his seat.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Renauld has regained consciousness,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d Poirot sprang to his feet. \u201cLet us all go to Merlinville at\r\nonce!\u201d\r\n\r\nA hurried departure was made forthwith. Stonor, at Jack\u2019s instance,\r\nagreed to stay behind and do all that could be done for Bella Duveen.\r\nPoirot, Jack Renauld and I set off in the Renauld car.\r\n\r\nThe run took just over forty minutes. As we approached the doorway of\r\nthe Villa Marguerite, Jack Renauld shot a questioning glance at Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow would it be if you went on first\u2014to break the news to my mother\r\nthat I am free\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhile you break it in person to Mademoiselle Marthe, eh?\u201d finished\r\nPoirot, with a twinkle. \u201cBut yes, by all means, I was about to propose\r\nsuch an arrangement myself.\u201d\r\n\r\nJack Renauld did not wait for more. Stopping the car, he swung himself\r\nout, and ran up the path to the front door. We went on in the car to\r\nthe Villa Genevi\u00e8ve.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot,\u201d I said, \u201cdo you remember how we arrived here that first day?\r\nAnd were met by the news of M. Renauld\u2019s murder?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! yes, truly. Not so long ago, either. But what a lot of things have\r\nhappened since then\u2014especially for you, _mon ami!___\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot, what have you done about finding Bel\u2014I mean Dulcie?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCalm yourself, Hastings. I arrange everything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re being a precious long time about it,\u201d I grumbled.\r\n\r\nPoirot changed the subject.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen the beginning, now the end,\u201d he moralized, as we rang the bell.\r\n\u201cAnd, considered as a case, the end is profoundly unsatisfactory.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d I sighed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are regarding it from the sentimental standpoint, Hastings. That\r\nwas not my meaning. We will hope that Mademoiselle Bella will be dealt\r\nwith leniently, and after all Jack Renauld cannot marry both the girls.\r\nI spoke from a professional standpoint. This is not a crime well\r\nordered and regular, such as a detective delights in. The _mise en\r\nsc\u00e8ne___ designed by Georges Conneau, that indeed is perfect, but the\r\n_d\u00e9nouement___\u2014ah, no! A man killed by accident in a girl\u2019s fit of\r\nanger\u2014ah, indeed, what order or method is there in that?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd in the midst of a fit of laughter on my part at Poirot\u2019s\r\npeculiarities, the door was opened by Fran\u00e7oise.\r\n\r\nPoirot explained that he must see Mrs. Renauld at once, and the old\r\nwoman conducted him upstairs. I remained in the _salon___. It was some\r\ntime before Poirot reappeared. He was looking unusually grave.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Vous voil\u00e0___, Hastings! _Sacr\u00e9 tonnerre___, but there are squalls\r\nahead!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would hardly have credited it,\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully, \u201cbut women\r\nare very unexpected.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere are Jack and Marthe Daubreuil,\u201d I exclaimed, looking out of the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nPoirot bounded out of the room, and met the young couple on the steps\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not enter. It is better not. Your mother is very upset.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know, I know,\u201d said Jack Renauld. \u201cI must go up to her at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut no, I tell you. It is better not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut Marthe and I\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn any case, do not take Mademoiselle with you. Mount, if you must,\r\nbut you would be wise to be guided by me.\u201d\r\n\r\nA voice on the stairs behind made us all start.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thank you for your good offices, M. Poirot, but I will make my own\r\nwishes clear.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe stared in astonishment. Descending the stairs, leaning upon L\u00e9onie\u2019s\r\narm, was Mrs. Renauld, her head still bandaged. The French girl was\r\nweeping, and imploring her mistress to return to bed.\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame will kill herself. It is contrary to all the doctor\u2019s orders!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Renauld came on.\r\n\r\n\u201cMother,\u201d cried Jack, starting forward. But with a gesture she drove\r\nhim back.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am no mother of yours! You are no son of mine! From this day and\r\nhour I renounce you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMother,\u201d cried the lad, stupefied.\r\n\r\nFor a moment she seemed to waver, to falter before the anguish in his\r\nvoice. Poirot made a mediating gesture, but instantly she regained\r\ncommand of herself.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour father\u2019s blood is on your head. You are morally guilty of his\r\ndeath. You thwarted and defied him over this girl, and by your\r\nheartless treatment of another girl, you brought about his death. Go\r\nout from my house. Tomorrow I intend to take such steps as shall make\r\nit certain that you shall never touch a penny of his money. Make your\r\nway in the world as best you can with the help of the girl who is the\r\ndaughter of your father\u2019s bitterest enemy!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd slowly, painfully, she retraced her way upstairs.\r\n\r\nWe were all dumbfounded\u2014totally unprepared for such a demonstration.\r\nJack Renauld, worn out with all he had already gone through, swayed and\r\nnearly fell. Poirot and I went quickly to his assistance.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is overdone,\u201d murmured Poirot to Marthe. \u201cWhere can we take him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut home! To the Villa Marguerite. We will nurse him, my mother and I.\r\nMy poor Jack!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe got the lad to the Villa, where he dropped limply on to a chair in a\r\nsemi-dazed condition. Poirot felt his head and hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has fever. The long strain begins to tell. And now this shock on\r\ntop of it. Get him to bed, and Hastings and I will summon a doctor.\u201d\r\n\r\nA doctor was soon procured. After examining the patient, he gave it as\r\nhis opinion that it was simply a case of nerve strain. With perfect\r\nrest and quiet, the lad might be almost restored by the next day, but,\r\nif excited, there was a chance of brain fever. It would be advisable\r\nfor some one to sit up all night with him.\r\n\r\nFinally, having done all we could, we left him in the charge of Marthe\r\nand her mother, and set out for the town. It was past our usual hour of\r\ndining, and we were both famished. The first restaurant we came to\r\nassuaged the pangs of hunger with an excellent _omelette___, and an\r\nequally excellent _entrec\u00f4te___ to follow.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now for quarters for the night,\u201d said Poirot, when at length _caf\u00e9\r\nnoir___ had completed the meal. \u201cShall we try our old friend, the H\u00f4tel\r\ndes Bains?\u201d\r\n\r\nWe traced our steps there without more ado. Yes, Messieurs could be\r\naccommodated with two good rooms overlooking the sea. Then Poirot asked\r\na question which surprised me.\r\n\r\n\u201cHas an English lady, Miss Robinson, arrived?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, monsieur. She is in the little _salon___.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot,\u201d I cried, keeping pace with him as he walked along the\r\ncorridor, \u201cwho on earth is Miss Robinson?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot beamed kindly on me.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is that I have arranged you a marriage, Hastings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, I say\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBah!\u201d said Poirot, giving me a friendly push over the threshold of the\r\ndoor. \u201cDo you think I wish to trumpet aloud in Merlinville the name of\r\nDuveen?\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was indeed Cinderella who rose to greet us. I took her hands in both\r\nof mine. My eyes said the rest.\r\n\r\nPoirot cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mes enfants___,\u201d he said, \u201cfor the moment we have no time for\r\nsentiment. There is work ahead of us. Mademoiselle, were you able to do\r\nwhat I asked you?\u201d\r\n\r\nIn response, Cinderella took from her bag an object wrapped up in\r\npaper, and handed it silently to Poirot. The latter unwrapped it. I\r\ngave a start\u2014for it was the aeroplane dagger which I understood she had\r\ncast into the sea. Strange, how reluctant women always are to destroy\r\nthe most compromising of objects and documents!\r\n\r\n\u201c_Tr\u00e8s bien, mon enfant___,\u201d said Poirot. \u201cI am pleased with you. Go\r\nnow and rest yourself. Hastings here and I have work to do. You shall\r\nsee him tomorrow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d asked the girl, her eyes widening.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou shall hear all about it tomorrow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause wherever you\u2019re going, I\u2019m coming too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut mademoiselle\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m coming too, I tell you.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot realized that it was futile to argue further. He gave in.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome then, mademoiselle. But it will not be amusing. In all\r\nprobability nothing will happen.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl made no reply.\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes later we set forth. It was quite dark now, a close,\r\noppressive evening. Poirot led the way out of the town in the direction\r\nof the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve. But when he reached the Villa Marguerite he\r\npaused.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like to assure myself that all goes well with Jack Renauld.\r\nCome with me, Hastings. Mademoiselle will perhaps remain outside.\r\nMadame Daubreuil might say something which would wound her.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe unlatched the gate, and walked up the path. As we went round to the\r\nside of the house, I drew Poirot\u2019s attention to a window on the first\r\nfloor. Thrown sharply on the blind was the profile of Marthe Daubreuil.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Poirot. \u201cI figure to myself that that is the room where we\r\nshall find Jack Renauld.\u201d\r\n\r\nMadame Daubreuil opened the door to us. She explained that Jack was\r\nmuch the same, but perhaps we would like to see for ourselves. She led\r\nus upstairs and into the bedroom. Marthe Daubreuil was embroidering by\r\na table with a lamp on it. She put her finger to her lips as we\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nJack Renauld was sleeping an uneasy fitful sleep, his head turning from\r\nside to side, and his face still unduly flushed.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs the doctor coming again?\u201d asked Poirot in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot unless we send. He is sleeping\u2014that is the great thing. _Maman___\r\nmade him a tisane.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe sat down again with her embroidery as we left the room. Madame\r\nDaubreuil accompanied us down the stairs. Since I had learned of her\r\npast history, I viewed this woman with increased interest. She stood\r\nthere with her eyes cast down, the same very faint enigmatical smile\r\nthat I remembered on her lips. And suddenly I felt afraid of her, as\r\none might feel afraid of a beautiful poisonous snake.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope we have not deranged you, madame,\u201d said Poirot politely as she\r\nopened the door for us to pass out.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d said Poirot, as though struck by an afterthought, \u201cM.\r\nStonor has not been in Merlinville today, has he?\u201d\r\n\r\nI could not at all fathom the point of this question which I well knew\r\nto be meaningless as far as Poirot was concerned.\r\n\r\nMadame Daubreuil replied quite composedly:\r\n\r\n\u201cNot that I know of.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has not had an interview with Mrs. Renauld?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow should I know that, monsieur?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue,\u201d said Poirot. \u201cI thought you might have seen him coming or\r\ngoing, that is all. Good night, madame.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy\u2014\u201d I began.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo \u2018_whys___,\u2019 Hastings. There will be time for that later.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe rejoined Cinderella and made our way rapidly in the direction of the\r\nVilla Genevi\u00e8ve. Poirot looked over his shoulder once at the lighted\r\nwindow and the profile of Marthe as she bent over her work.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is being guarded at all events,\u201d he muttered.\r\n\r\nArrived at the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve, Poirot took up his stand behind some\r\nbushes to the left of the drive, where, whilst enjoying a good view\r\nourselves, we were completely hidden from sight. The Villa itself was\r\nin total darkness, everybody was without doubt in bed and asleep. We\r\nwere almost immediately under the window of Mrs. Renauld\u2019s bedroom,\r\nwhich window, I noticed, was open. It seemed to me that it was upon\r\nthis spot that Poirot\u2019s eyes were fixed.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d I whispered.\r\n\r\n\u201cWatch.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not expect anything to happen for at least an hour, probably two\r\nhours, but the\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nBut his words were interrupted by a long thin drawn cry:\r\n\r\n\u201cHelp!\u201d\r\n\r\nA light flashed up in the second floor room on the right hand side of\r\nthe house. The cry came from there. And even as we watched there came a\r\nshadow on the blind as of two people struggling.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mille tonnerres!___\u201d cried Poirot. \u201cShe must have changed her room!\u201d\r\n\r\nDashing forward, he battered wildly on the front door. Then rushing to\r\nthe tree in the flower-bed, he swarmed up it with the agility of a cat.\r\nI followed him, as with a bound he sprang in through the open window.\r\nLooking over my shoulder, I saw Dulcie reaching the branch behind me.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake care,\u201d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake care of your grandmother!\u201d retorted the girl. \u201cThis is child\u2019s\r\nplay to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot had rushed through the empty room and was pounding on the door\r\nleading into the corridor.\r\n\r\n\u201cLocked and bolted on the outside,\u201d he growled. \u201cAnd it will take time\r\nto burst it open.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe cries for help were getting noticeably fainter. I saw despair in\r\nPoirot\u2019s eyes. He and I together put our shoulders to the door.\r\n\r\nCinderella\u2019s voice, calm and dispassionate, came from the window:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be too late, I guess I\u2019m the only one who can do anything.\u201d\r\n\r\nBefore I could move a hand to stop her, she appeared to leap upward\r\ninto space. I rushed and looked out. To my horror, I saw her hanging by\r\nher hands from the roof, propelling herself along by jerks in the\r\ndirection of the lighted window.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens! She\u2019ll be killed,\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou forget. She\u2019s a professional acrobat, Hastings. It was the\r\nprovidence of the good God that made her insist on coming with us\r\ntonight. I only pray that she may be in time. Ah!\u201d\r\n\r\nA cry of absolute terror floated out on to the night as the girl\r\ndisappeared through the right-hand window; then in Cinderella\u2019s clear\r\ntones came the words:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t! I\u2019ve got you\u2014and my wrists are just like steel.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the door of our prison was opened cautiously by\r\nFran\u00e7oise. Poirot brushed her aside unceremoniously and rushed down the\r\npassage to where the other maids were grouped round the further door.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s locked on the inside, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was the sound of a heavy fall within. After a moment or two the\r\nkey turned and the door swung slowly open. Cinderella, very pale,\r\nbeckoned us in.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is safe?\u201d demanded Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I was just in time. She was exhausted.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Renauld was half sitting, half lying on the bed. She was gasping\r\nfor breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cNearly strangled me,\u201d she murmured painfully. The girl picked up\r\nsomething from the floor and handed it to Poirot. It was a rolled up\r\nladder of silk rope, very fine but quite strong.\r\n\r\n\u201cA getaway,\u201d said Poirot. \u201cBy the window, whilst we were battering at\r\nthe door. Where is\u2014the other?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl stood aside a little and pointed. On the ground lay a figure\r\nwrapped in some dark material a fold of which hid the face.\r\n\r\n\u201cDead?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHead must have struck the marble fender.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut who is it?\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe murderer of M. Renauld, Hastings. And the would-be murderer of\r\nMadame Renauld.\u201d\r\n\r\nPuzzled and uncomprehending, I knelt down, and lifting the fold of\r\ncloth, looked into the dead beautiful face of Marthe Daubreuil!\r\n\nI have confused memories of the further events of that night. Poirot\r\nseemed deaf to my repeated questions. He was engaged in overwhelming\r\nFran\u00e7oise with reproaches for not having told him of Mrs. Renauld\u2019s\r\nchange of sleeping quarters.\r\n\r\nI caught him by the shoulder, determined to attract his attention, and\r\nmake myself heard.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you _must___ have known,\u201d I expostulated. \u201cYou were taken up to\r\nsee her this afternoon.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot deigned to attend to me for a brief moment.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe had been wheeled on a sofa into the middle room\u2014her boudoir,\u201d he\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut, monsieur,\u201d cried Fran\u00e7oise, \u201cMadame changed her room almost\r\nimmediately after the crime! The associations\u2014they were too\r\ndistressing!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen why was I not told,\u201d vociferated Poirot, striking the table, and\r\nworking himself into a first-class passion. \u201cI demand\r\nyou\u2014why\u2014was\u2014I\u2014not\u2014told? You are an old woman completely imbecile! And\r\nL\u00e9onie and Denise are no better. All of you are triple idiots! Your\r\nstupidity has nearly caused the death of your mistress. But for this\r\ncourageous child\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nHe broke off, and, darting across the room to where the girl was\r\nbending over ministering to Mrs. Renauld, he embraced her with Gallic\r\nfervour\u2014slightly to my annoyance.\r\n\r\nI was aroused from my condition of mental fog by a sharp command from\r\nPoirot to fetch the doctor immediately on Mrs. Renauld\u2019s behalf. After\r\nthat, I might summon the police. And he added, to complete my dudgeon:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will hardly be worth your while to return here. I shall be too busy\r\nto attend to you, and of Mademoiselle here I make a _garde-malad___.\u201d\r\n\r\nI retired with what dignity I could command. Having done my errands, I\r\nreturned to the hotel. I understood next to nothing of what had\r\noccurred. The events of the night seemed fantastic and impossible.\r\nNobody would answer my questions. Nobody had seemed to hear them.\r\nAngrily, I flung myself into bed, and slept the sleep of the bewildered\r\nand utterly exhausted.\r\n\r\nI awoke to find the sun pouring in through the open windows and Poirot,\r\nneat and smiling, sitting beside the bed.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Enfin___ you wake! But it is that you are a famous sleeper, Hastings!\r\nDo you know that it is nearly eleven o\u2019clock?\u201d\r\n\r\nI groaned and put a hand to my head.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must have been dreaming,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you know, I actually dreamt\r\nthat we found Marthe Daubreuil\u2019s body in Mrs. Renauld\u2019s room, and that\r\nyou declared her to have murdered Mr. Renauld?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were not dreaming. All that is quite true.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut Bella Duveen killed Mr. Renauld?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, Hastings, she did not! She said she did\u2014yes\u2014but that was to\r\nsave the man she loved from the guillotine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRemember Jack Renauld\u2019s story. They both arrived on the scene at the\r\nsame instant, and each took the other to be the perpetrator of the\r\ncrime. The girl stares at him in horror, and then with a cry rushes\r\naway. But, when she hears that the crime has been brought home to him,\r\nshe cannot bear it, and comes forward to accuse herself and save him\r\nfrom certain death.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot leaned back in his chair, and brought the tips of his fingers\r\ntogether in familiar style.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe case was not quite satisfactory to me,\u201d he observed judicially.\r\n\u201cAll along I was strongly under the impression that we were dealing\r\nwith a cold-blooded and premeditated crime committed by some one who\r\nhad been contented (very cleverly) with using M. Renauld\u2019s own plans\r\nfor throwing the police off the track. The great criminal (as you may\r\nremember my remarking to you once) is always supremely simple.\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, to support this theory, the criminal must have been fully\r\ncognizant of Mr. Renauld\u2019s plans. That leads us to Madame Renauld. But\r\nfacts fail to support any theory of her guilt. Is there any one else\r\nwho might have known of them? Yes. From Marthe Daubreuil\u2019s own lips we\r\nhave the admission that she overheard M. Renauld\u2019s quarrel with the\r\ntramp. If she could overhear that, there is no reason why she should\r\nnot have heard everything else, especially if M. and Madame Renauld\r\nwere imprudent enough to discuss their plans sitting on the bench.\r\nRemember how easily you overheard Marthe\u2019s conversation with Jack\r\nRenauld from that spot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what possible motive could Marthe have for murdering Mr. Renauld?\u201d\r\nI argued.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat motive? Money! M. Renauld was a millionaire several times over,\r\nand at his death (or so she and Jack believed) half that vast fortune\r\nwould pass to his son. Let us reconstruct the scene from the standpoint\r\nof Marthe Daubreuil.\r\n\r\n\u201cMarthe Daubreuil overhears what passes between Renauld and his wife.\r\nSo far he has been a nice little source of income to the Daubreuil\r\nmother and daughter, but now he proposes to escape from their toils. At\r\nfirst, possibly, her idea is to prevent that escape. But a bolder idea\r\ntakes its place, and one that fails to horrify the daughter of Jeanne\r\nBeroldy! At present M. Renauld stands inexorably in the way of her\r\nmarriage with Jack. If the latter defies his father, he will be a\r\npauper\u2014which is not at all to the mind of Mademoiselle Marthe. In fact,\r\nI doubt if she has ever cared a straw for Jack Renauld. She can\r\nsimulate emotion, but in reality she is of the same cold, calculating\r\ntype as her mother. I doubt, too, whether she was really very sure of\r\nher hold over the boy\u2019s affections. She had dazzled and captivated him,\r\nbut separated from her, as his father could so easily manage to\r\nseparate him, she might lose him. But with M. Renauld dead, and Jack\r\nthe heir to half his millions, the marriage can take place at once, and\r\nat a stroke she will attain wealth\u2014not the beggarly thousands that have\r\nbeen extracted from him so far. And her clever brain takes in the\r\nsimplicity of the thing. It is all so easy. M. Renauld is planning all\r\nthe circumstances of his death\u2014she has only to step in at the right\r\nmoment and turn the farce into a grim reality. And here comes in the\r\nsecond point which led me infallibly to Marthe Daubreuil\u2014the dagger!\r\nJack Renauld had _three___ souvenirs made. One he gave to his mother,\r\none to Bella Duveen; was it not highly probable that he had given the\r\nthird one to Marthe Daubreuil?\r\n\r\n\u201cSo then, to sum up, there were four points of note against Marthe\r\nDaubreuil:\r\n\r\n\u201c(1) Marthe Daubreuil could have overheard M. Renauld\u2019s plans.\r\n\r\n\u201c(2) Marthe Daubreuil had a direct interest in causing M. Renauld\u2019s\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\u201c(3) Marthe Daubreuil was the daughter of the notorious Madame Beroldy\r\nwho in my opinion was morally and virtually the murderess of her\r\nhusband, although it may have been Georges Conneau\u2019s hand which struck\r\nthe actual blow.\r\n\r\n\u201c(4) Marthe Daubreuil was the only person, besides Jack Renauld, likely\r\nto have the third dagger in her possession.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot paused and cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course, when I learned of the existence of the other girl, Bella\r\nDuveen, I realized that it was quite possible that _she___ might have\r\nkilled M. Renauld. The solution did not commend itself to me, because,\r\nas I pointed out to you, Hastings, an expert, such as I am, likes to\r\nmeet a foeman worthy of his steel. Still one must take crimes as one\r\nfinds them, not as one would like them to be. It did not seem very\r\nlikely that Bella Duveen would be wandering about carrying a souvenir\r\npaper-knife in her hand, but of course she might have had some idea all\r\nthe time of revenging herself on Jack Renauld. When she actually came\r\nforward and confessed to the murder, it seemed that all was over. And\r\nyet\u2014I was not satisfied, _mon ami___. _I was not satisfied.\u200a\u2026___\r\n\r\n\u201cI went over the case again minutely, and I came to the same conclusion\r\nas before. If it was _not___ Bella Duveen, the only other person who\r\ncould have committed the crime was Marthe Daubreuil. But I had not one\r\nsingle proof against her!\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then you showed me that letter from Mademoiselle Dulcie, and I saw\r\na chance of settling the matter once for all. The original dagger was\r\nstolen by Dulcie Duveen and thrown into the sea\u2014since, as she thought,\r\nit belonged to her sister. But if, by any chance, it was _not___ her\r\nsister\u2019s, but the one given by Jack to Marthe Daubreuil\u2014why then, Bella\r\nDuveen\u2019s dagger would be still intact! I said no word to you, Hastings\r\n(it was no time for romance) but I sought out Mademoiselle Dulcie, told\r\nher as much as I deemed needful, and set her to search amongst the\r\neffects of her sister. Imagine my elation, when she sought me out\r\n(according to my instructions) as Miss Robinson with the precious\r\nsouvenir in her possession!\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the meantime I had taken steps to force Mademoiselle Marthe into\r\nthe open. By my orders, Mrs. Renauld repulsed her son, and declared her\r\nintention of making a will on the morrow which should cut him off from\r\never enjoying even a portion of his father\u2019s fortune. It was a\r\ndesperate step, but a necessary one, and Madame Renauld was fully\r\nprepared to take the risk\u2014though unfortunately she also never thought\r\nof mentioning her change of room. I suppose she took it for granted\r\nthat I knew. All happened as I thought. Marthe Daubreuil made a last\r\nbold bid for the Renauld millions\u2014and failed!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat absolutely bewilders me,\u201d I said, \u201cis how she ever got into the\r\nhouse without our seeing her. It seems an absolute miracle. We left her\r\nbehind at the Villa Marguerite, we go straight to the Villa\r\nGenevi\u00e8ve\u2014and yet she is there before us!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, but we did not leave her behind. She was out of the Villa\r\nMarguerite by the back way whilst we were talking to her mother in the\r\nhall. That is where, as the Americans say, she \u2018put it over\u2019 on Hercule\r\nPoirot!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the shadow on the blind? We saw it from the road.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien___, when we looked up, Madame Daubreuil had just had time to\r\nrun upstairs and take her place.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame Daubreuil?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. One is old, and one is young, one dark, and one fair, but, for\r\nthe purpose of a silhouette on a blind, their profiles are singularly\r\nalike. Even I did not suspect\u2014triple imbecile that I was! I thought I\r\nhad plenty of time before me\u2014that she would not try to gain admission\r\nto the Villa until much later. She had brains, that beautiful\r\nMademoiselle Marthe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd her object was to murder Mrs. Renauld?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. The whole fortune would then pass to her son. But it would have\r\nbeen suicide, _mon ami!___ On the floor by Marthe Daubreuil\u2019s body, I\r\nfound a pad and a little bottle of chloroform and a hypodermic syringe\r\ncontaining a fatal dose of morphine. You understand? The chloroform\r\nfirst\u2014then when the victim is unconscious the prick of the needle. By\r\nthe morning the smell of the chloroform has quite disappeared, and the\r\nsyringe lies where it has fallen from Madame Renauld\u2019s hand. What would\r\nhe say, the excellent M. Hautet? \u2018Poor woman! What did I tell you? The\r\nshock of joy, it was too much on top of the rest! Did I not say that I\r\nshould not be surprised if her brain became unhinged. Altogether a most\r\ntragic case, the Renauld Case!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHowever, Hastings, things did not go quite as Mademoiselle Marthe had\r\nplanned. To begin with, Madame Renauld was awake and waiting for her.\r\nThere is a struggle. But Madame Renauld is terribly weak still. There\r\nis a last chance for Marthe Daubreuil. The idea of suicide is at an\r\nend, but if she can silence Madame Renauld with her strong hands, make\r\na getaway with her little silk ladder whilst we are still battering on\r\nthe inside of the further door, and be back at the Villa Marguerite\r\nbefore we return there, it will be hard to prove anything against her.\r\nBut she was checkmated\u2014not by Hercule Poirot\u2014but by _la petite\r\nacrobate___ with her wrists of steel.\u201d\r\n\r\nI mused over the whole story.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did you first begin to suspect Marthe Daubreuil, Poirot? When she\r\ntold us she had overheard the quarrel in the garden?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy friend, do you remember when we drove into Merlinville that first\r\nday? And the beautiful girl we saw standing at the gate? You asked me\r\nif I had not noticed a young goddess, and I replied to you that I had\r\nseen only a girl with anxious eyes. That is how I have thought of\r\nMarthe Daubreuil from the beginning. _The girl with the anxious\r\neyes!___ Why was she anxious? Not on Jack Renauld\u2019s behalf, for she did\r\nnot know then that he had been in Merlinville the previous evening.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d I exclaimed, \u201chow is Jack Renauld?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMuch better. He is still at the Villa Marguerite. But Madame Daubreuil\r\nhas disappeared. The police are looking for her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas she in with her daughter, do you think?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe shall never know. Madame is a lady who can keep her secrets. And I\r\ndoubt very much if the police will ever find her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHas Jack Renauld been\u2014told?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will be a terrible shock to him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNaturally. And yet, do you know, Hastings, I doubt if his heart was\r\never seriously engaged. So far we have looked upon Bella Duveen as a\r\nsiren, and Marthe Daubreuil as the girl he really loved. But I think\r\nthat if we reversed the terms we should come nearer to the truth.\r\nMarthe Daubreuil was very beautiful. She set herself to fascinate Jack,\r\nand she succeeded, but remember his curious reluctance to break with\r\nthe other girl. And see how he was willing to go to the guillotine\r\nrather than implicate her. I have a little idea that when he learns the\r\ntruth he will be horrified\u2014revolted, and his false love will wither\r\naway.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about Giraud?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has a _crise___ of the nerves, that one! He has been obliged to\r\nreturn to Paris.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe both smiled.\r\n\r\nPoirot proved a fairly true prophet. When at length the doctor\r\npronounced Jack Renauld strong enough to hear the truth, it was Poirot\r\nwho broke it to him. The shock was indeed terrific. Yet Jack rallied\r\nbetter than I could have supposed possible. His mother\u2019s devotion\r\nhelped him to live through those difficult days. The mother and son\r\nwere inseparable now.\r\n\r\nThere was a further revelation to come. Poirot had acquainted Mrs.\r\nRenauld with the fact that he knew her secret, and had represented to\r\nher that Jack should not be left in ignorance of his father\u2019s past.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo hide the truth, never does it avail, madame! Be brave and tell him\r\neverything.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a heavy heart Mrs. Renauld consented, and her son learned that the\r\nfather he had loved had been in actual fact a fugitive from justice. A\r\nhalting question was promptly answered by Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cReassure yourself, M. Jack. The world knows nothing. As far as I can\r\nsee, there is no obligation for me to take the police into my\r\nconfidence. Throughout the case I have acted, not for them, but for\r\nyour father. Justice overtook him at last, but no one need ever know\r\nthat he and Georges Conneau were one and the same.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere were, of course, various points in the case that remained\r\npuzzling to the police, but Poirot explained things in so plausible a\r\nfashion that all query about them was gradually stilled.\r\n\r\nShortly after we got back to London, I noticed a magnificent model of a\r\nfoxhound adorning Poirot\u2019s mantelpiece. In answer to my inquiring\r\nglance, Poirot nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mais, oui!___ I got my 500 francs! Is he not a splendid fellow? I\r\ncall him Giraud!\u201d\r\n\r\nA few days later Jack Renauld came to see us with a resolute expression\r\non his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cM. Poirot, I\u2019ve come to say good-bye. I\u2019m sailing for South America\r\nalmost immediately. My father had large interests over the continent,\r\nand I mean to start a new life out there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou go alone, M. Jack?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy mother comes with me\u2014and I shall keep Stonor on as my secretary. He\r\nlikes out of-the-way parts of the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo one else goes with you?\u201d\r\n\r\nJack flushed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA girl who loves you very dearly\u2014who has been willing to lay down her\r\nlife for you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow could I ask her?\u201d muttered the boy. \u201cAfter all that has happened,\r\ncould I go to her and\u2014oh, what sort of a lame story could I tell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Les femmes___\u2014they have a wonderful genius for manufacturing crutches\r\nfor stories like that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but\u2014I\u2019ve been such a damned fool!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo have all of us, at one time and another,\u201d observed Poirot\r\nphilosophically.\r\n\r\nBut Jack\u2019s face had hardened.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s something else. I\u2019m my father\u2019s son. Would any one marry me,\r\nknowing that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are your father\u2019s son, you say. Hastings here will tell you that I\r\nbelieve in heredity\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWait. I know a woman, a woman of courage and endurance, capable of\r\ngreat love, of supreme self-sacrifice\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boy looked up. His eyes softened.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy mother!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. You are your mother\u2019s son as well as your father\u2019s. Go then to\r\nMademoiselle Bella. Tell her everything. Keep nothing back\u2014and see what\r\nshe will say!\u201d\r\n\r\nJack looked irresolute.\r\n\r\n\u201cGo to her as a boy no longer, but a man\u2014a man bowed by the fate of the\r\nPast, and the fate of Today, but looking forward to a new and wonderful\r\nlife. Ask her to share it with you. You may not realize it, but your\r\nlove for each other has been tested in the fire and not found wanting.\r\nYou have both been willing to lay down your lives for each other.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd what of Captain Arthur Hastings, humble chronicler of these pages?\r\n\r\nThere is some talk of his joining the Renaulds on a ranch across the\r\nseas, but for the end of this story I prefer to go back to a morning in\r\nthe garden of the Villa Genevi\u00e8ve.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t call you Bella,\u201d I said, \u201csince it isn\u2019t your name. And Dulcie\r\nseems so unfamiliar. So it\u2019s got to be Cinderella. Cinderella married\r\nthe Prince, you remember. I\u2019m not a Prince, but\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nShe interrupted me.\r\n\r\n\u201cCinderella warned him, I\u2019m sure! You see, she couldn\u2019t promise to turn\r\ninto a princess. She was only a little scullion after all\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Prince\u2019s turn to interrupt,\u201d I interpolated. \u201cDo you know\r\nwhat he said?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u200a\u2018Hell!\u2019 said the Prince\u2014and kissed her!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd I suited the action to the word.\r\n\n", "The Secret Adversary": "IT was 2 p.m. on the afternoon of May 7, 1915. The _Lusitania_ had been\r\nstruck by two torpedoes in succession and was sinking rapidly, while\r\nthe boats were being launched with all possible speed. The women and\r\nchildren were being lined up awaiting their turn. Some still clung\r\ndesperately to husbands and fathers; others clutched their children\r\nclosely to their breasts. One girl stood alone, slightly apart from\r\nthe rest. She was quite young, not more than eighteen. She did not seem\r\nafraid, and her grave, steadfast eyes looked straight ahead.\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon.\u201d\r\n\r\nA man\u2019s voice beside her made her start and turn. She had noticed the\r\nspeaker more than once amongst the first-class passengers. There had\r\nbeen a hint of mystery about him which had appealed to her imagination.\r\nHe spoke to no one. If anyone spoke to him he was quick to rebuff the\r\noverture. Also he had a nervous way of looking over his shoulder with a\r\nswift, suspicious glance.\r\n\r\nShe noticed now that he was greatly agitated. There were beads of\r\nperspiration on his brow. He was evidently in a state of overmastering\r\nfear. And yet he did not strike her as the kind of man who would be\r\nafraid to meet death!\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d Her grave eyes met his inquiringly.\r\n\r\nHe stood looking at her with a kind of desperate irresolution.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must be!\u201d he muttered to himself. \u201cYes--it is the only way.\u201d Then\r\naloud he said abruptly: \u201cYou are an American?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA patriotic one?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl flushed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019ve no right to ask such a thing! Of course I am!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be offended. You wouldn\u2019t be if you knew how much there was at\r\nstake. But I\u2019ve got to trust some one--and it must be a woman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause of \u2018women and children first.\u2019\u201d He looked round and lowered his\r\nvoice. \u201cI\u2019m carrying papers--vitally important papers. They may make all\r\nthe difference to the Allies in the war. You understand? These papers\r\nhave _got_ to be saved! They\u2019ve more chance with you than with me. Will\r\nyou take them?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl held out her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cWait--I must warn you. There may be a risk--if I\u2019ve been followed. I\r\ndon\u2019t think I have, but one never knows. If so, there will be danger.\r\nHave you the nerve to go through with it?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go through with it all right. And I\u2019m real proud to be chosen!\r\nWhat am I to do with them afterwards?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWatch the newspapers! I\u2019ll advertise in the personal column of the\r\n_Times_, beginning \u2018Shipmate.\u2019 At the end of three days if there\u2019s\r\nnothing--well, you\u2019ll know I\u2019m down and out. Then take the packet to\r\nthe American Embassy, and deliver it into the Ambassador\u2019s own hands. Is\r\nthat clear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite clear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen be ready--I\u2019m going to say good-bye.\u201d He took her hand in his.\r\n\u201cGood-bye. Good luck to you,\u201d he said in a louder tone.\r\n\r\nHer hand closed on the oilskin packet that had lain in his palm.\r\n\r\nThe _Lusitania_ settled with a more decided list to starboard. In answer\r\nto a quick command, the girl went forward to take her place in the boat.\r\n\n\u201cTOMMY, old thing!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTuppence, old bean!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe two young people greeted each other affectionately, and momentarily\r\nblocked the Dover Street Tube exit in doing so. The adjective \u201cold\u201d\r\n was misleading. Their united ages would certainly not have totalled\r\nforty-five.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot seen you for simply centuries,\u201d continued the young man. \u201cWhere are\r\nyou off to? Come and chew a bun with me. We\u2019re getting a bit unpopular\r\nhere--blocking the gangway as it were. Let\u2019s get out of it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl assenting, they started walking down Dover Street towards\r\nPiccadilly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow then,\u201d said Tommy, \u201cwhere shall we go?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe very faint anxiety which underlay his tone did not escape the astute\r\nears of Miss Prudence Cowley, known to her intimate friends for some\r\nmysterious reason as \u201cTuppence.\u201d She pounced at once.\r\n\r\n\u201cTommy, you\u2019re stony!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d declared Tommy unconvincingly. \u201cRolling in cash.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou always were a shocking liar,\u201d said Tuppence severely, \u201cthough you\r\ndid once persuade Sister Greenbank that the doctor had ordered you beer\r\nas a tonic, but forgotten to write it on the chart. Do you remember?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy chuckled.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should think I did! Wasn\u2019t the old cat in a rage when she found\r\nout? Not that she was a bad sort really, old Mother Greenbank! Good old\r\nhospital--demobbed like everything else, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence sighed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. You too?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo months ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGratuity?\u201d hinted Tuppence.\r\n\r\n\u201cSpent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Tommy!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, old thing, not in riotous dissipation. No such luck! The cost of\r\nliving--ordinary plain, or garden living nowadays is, I assure you, if\r\nyou do not know----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear child,\u201d interrupted Tuppence, \u201cthere is nothing I do _not_ know\r\nabout the cost of living. Here we are at Lyons\u2019, and we will each of us\r\npay for our own. That\u2019s it!\u201d And Tuppence led the way upstairs.\r\n\r\nThe place was full, and they wandered about looking for a table,\r\ncatching odds and ends of conversation as they did so.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd--do you know, she sat down and _cried_ when I told her she couldn\u2019t\r\nhave the flat after all.\u201d \u201cIt was simply a _bargain_, my dear! Just like\r\nthe one Mabel Lewis brought from Paris----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFunny scraps one does overhear,\u201d murmured Tommy. \u201cI passed two Johnnies\r\nin the street to-day talking about some one called Jane Finn. Did you\r\never hear such a name?\u201d\r\n\r\nBut at that moment two elderly ladies rose and collected parcels, and\r\nTuppence deftly ensconced herself in one of the vacant seats.\r\n\r\nTommy ordered tea and buns. Tuppence ordered tea and buttered toast.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd mind the tea comes in separate teapots,\u201d she added severely.\r\n\r\nTommy sat down opposite her. His bared head revealed a shock\r\nof exquisitely slicked-back red hair. His face was pleasantly\r\nugly--nondescript, yet unmistakably the face of a gentleman and a\r\nsportsman. His brown suit was well cut, but perilously near the end of\r\nits tether.\r\n\r\nThey were an essentially modern-looking couple as they sat there.\r\nTuppence had no claim to beauty, but there was character and charm in\r\nthe elfin lines of her little face, with its determined chin and large,\r\nwide-apart grey eyes that looked mistily out from under straight, black\r\nbrows. She wore a small bright green toque over her black bobbed hair,\r\nand her extremely short and rather shabby skirt revealed a pair of\r\nuncommonly dainty ankles. Her appearance presented a valiant attempt at\r\nsmartness.\r\n\r\nThe tea came at last, and Tuppence, rousing herself from a fit of\r\nmeditation, poured it out.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow then,\u201d said Tommy, taking a large bite of bun, \u201clet\u2019s get\r\nup-to-date. Remember, I haven\u2019t seen you since that time in hospital in\r\n1916.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d Tuppence helped herself liberally to buttered toast.\r\n\u201cAbridged biography of Miss Prudence Cowley, fifth daughter of\r\nArchdeacon Cowley of Little Missendell, Suffolk. Miss Cowley left the\r\ndelights (and drudgeries) of her home life early in the war and came up\r\nto London, where she entered an officers\u2019 hospital. First month: Washed\r\nup six hundred and forty-eight plates every day. Second month: Promoted\r\nto drying aforesaid plates. Third month: Promoted to peeling potatoes.\r\nFourth month: Promoted to cutting bread and butter. Fifth month:\r\nPromoted one floor up to duties of wardmaid with mop and pail. Sixth\r\nmonth: Promoted to waiting at table. Seventh month: Pleasing appearance\r\nand nice manners so striking that am promoted to waiting on the Sisters!\r\nEighth month: Slight check in career. Sister Bond ate Sister Westhaven\u2019s\r\negg! Grand row! Wardmaid clearly to blame! Inattention in such important\r\nmatters cannot be too highly censured. Mop and pail again! How are the\r\nmighty fallen! Ninth month: Promoted to sweeping out wards, where I\r\nfound a friend of my childhood in Lieutenant Thomas Beresford (bow,\r\nTommy!), whom I had not seen for five long years. The meeting was\r\naffecting! Tenth month: Reproved by matron for visiting the pictures in\r\ncompany with one of the patients, namely: the aforementioned Lieutenant\r\nThomas Beresford. Eleventh and twelfth months: Parlourmaid duties\r\nresumed with entire success. At the end of the year left hospital in a\r\nblaze of glory. After that, the talented Miss Cowley drove successively\r\na trade delivery van, a motor-lorry and a general! The last was the\r\npleasantest. He was quite a young general!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat blighter was that?\u201d inquired Tommy. \u201cPerfectly sickening the way\r\nthose brass hats drove from the War Office to the _Savoy_, and from the\r\n_Savoy_ to the War Office!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve forgotten his name now,\u201d confessed Tuppence. \u201cTo resume, that was\r\nin a way the apex of my career. I next entered a Government office. We\r\nhad several very enjoyable tea parties. I had intended to become a\r\nland girl, a postwoman, and a bus conductress by way of rounding off\r\nmy career--but the Armistice intervened! I clung to the office with the\r\ntrue limpet touch for many long months, but, alas, I was combed out at\r\nlast. Since then I\u2019ve been looking for a job. Now then--your turn.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s not so much promotion in mine,\u201d said Tommy regretfully, \u201cand a\r\ngreat deal less variety. I went out to France again, as you know. Then\r\nthey sent me to Mesopotamia, and I got wounded for the second time,\r\nand went into hospital out there. Then I got stuck in Egypt till the\r\nArmistice happened, kicked my heels there some time longer, and, as I\r\ntold you, finally got demobbed. And, for ten long, weary months I\u2019ve\r\nbeen job hunting! There aren\u2019t any jobs! And, if there were, they\r\nwouldn\u2019t give \u2018em to me. What good am I? What do I know about business?\r\nNothing.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence nodded gloomily.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about the colonies?\u201d she suggested.\r\n\r\nTommy shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t like the colonies--and I\u2019m perfectly certain they wouldn\u2019t\r\nlike me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRich relations?\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain Tommy shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Tommy, not even a great-aunt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got an old uncle who\u2019s more or less rolling, but he\u2019s no good.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWanted to adopt me once. I refused.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I remember hearing about it,\u201d said Tuppence slowly. \u201cYou\r\nrefused because of your mother----\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy flushed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it would have been a bit rough on the mater. As you know, I was\r\nall she had. Old boy hated her--wanted to get me away from her. Just a\r\nbit of spite.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour mother\u2019s dead, isn\u2019t she?\u201d said Tuppence gently.\r\n\r\nTommy nodded.\r\n\r\nTuppence\u2019s large grey eyes looked misty.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good sort, Tommy. I always knew it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRot!\u201d said Tommy hastily. \u201cWell, that\u2019s my position. I\u2019m just about\r\ndesperate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo am I! I\u2019ve hung out as long as I could. I\u2019ve touted round. I\u2019ve\r\nanswered advertisements. I\u2019ve tried every mortal blessed thing. I\u2019ve\r\nscrewed and saved and pinched! But it\u2019s no good. I shall have to go\r\nhome!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course I don\u2019t want to! What\u2019s the good of being sentimental?\r\nFather\u2019s a dear--I\u2019m awfully fond of him--but you\u2019ve no idea how I worry\r\nhim! He has that delightful early Victorian view that short skirts and\r\nsmoking are immoral. You can imagine what a thorn in the flesh I am to\r\nhim! He just heaved a sigh of relief when the war took me off. You see,\r\nthere are seven of us at home. It\u2019s awful! All housework and mothers\u2019\r\nmeetings! I have always been the changeling. I don\u2019t want to go back,\r\nbut--oh, Tommy, what else is there to do?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy shook his head sadly. There was a silence, and then Tuppence burst\r\nout:\r\n\r\n\u201cMoney, money, money! I think about money morning, noon and night! I\r\ndare say it\u2019s mercenary of me, but there it is!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSame here,\u201d agreed Tommy with feeling.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought over every imaginable way of getting it too,\u201d continued\r\nTuppence. \u201cThere are only three! To be left it, to marry it, or to make\r\nit. First is ruled out. I haven\u2019t got any rich elderly relatives. Any\r\nrelatives I have are in homes for decayed gentlewomen! I always help old\r\nladies over crossings, and pick up parcels for old gentlemen, in case\r\nthey should turn out to be eccentric millionaires. But not one of them\r\nhas ever asked me my name--and quite a lot never said \u2018Thank you.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d resumed Tuppence, \u201cmarriage is my best chance. I made up my\r\nmind to marry money when I was quite young. Any thinking girl would!\r\nI\u2019m not sentimental, you know.\u201d She paused. \u201cCome now, you can\u2019t say I\u2019m\r\nsentimental,\u201d she added sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly not,\u201d agreed Tommy hastily. \u201cNo one would ever think of\r\nsentiment in connection with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not very polite,\u201d replied Tuppence. \u201cBut I dare say you mean it\r\nall right. Well, there it is! I\u2019m ready and willing--but I never meet\r\nany rich men! All the boys I know are about as hard up as I am.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about the general?\u201d inquired Tommy.\r\n\r\n\u201cI fancy he keeps a bicycle shop in time of peace,\u201d explained Tuppence.\r\n\u201cNo, there it is! Now _you_ could marry a rich girl.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m like you. I don\u2019t know any.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. You can always get to know one. Now, if I see a\r\nman in a fur coat come out of the _Ritz_ I can\u2019t rush up to him and say:\r\n\u2018Look here, you\u2019re rich. I\u2019d like to know you.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garbed female?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. You tread on her foot, or pick up her handkerchief, or\r\nsomething like that. If she thinks you want to know her she\u2019s flattered,\r\nand will manage it for you somehow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou overrate my manly charms,\u201d murmured Tommy.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the other hand,\u201d proceeded Tuppence, \u201cmy millionaire would probably\r\nrun for his life! No--marriage is fraught with difficulties. Remains--to\r\n_make_ money!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried that, and failed,\u201d Tommy reminded her.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried all the orthodox ways, yes. But suppose we try the\r\nunorthodox. Tommy, let\u2019s be adventurers!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d replied Tommy cheerfully. \u201cHow do we begin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the difficulty. If we could make ourselves known, people might\r\nhire us to commit crimes for them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDelightful,\u201d commented Tommy. \u201cEspecially coming from a clergyman\u2019s\r\ndaughter!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe moral guilt,\u201d Tuppence pointed out, \u201cwould be theirs--not mine. You\r\nmust admit that there\u2019s a difference between stealing a diamond necklace\r\nfor yourself and being hired to steal it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be the least difference if you were caught!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps not. But I shouldn\u2019t be caught. I\u2019m so clever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cModesty always was your besetting sin,\u201d remarked Tommy.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t rag. Look here, Tommy, shall we really? Shall we form a business\r\npartnership?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cForm a company for the stealing of diamond necklaces?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was only an illustration. Let\u2019s have a--what do you call it in\r\nbook-keeping?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know. Never did any.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have--but I always got mixed up, and used to put credit entries on\r\nthe debit side, and vice versa--so they fired me out. Oh, I know--a\r\njoint venture! It struck me as such a romantic phrase to come across in\r\nthe middle of musty old figures. It\u2019s got an Elizabethan flavour about\r\nit--makes one think of galleons and doubloons. A joint venture!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrading under the name of the Young Adventurers, Ltd.? Is that your\r\nidea, Tuppence?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very well to laugh, but I feel there might be something in\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you propose to get in touch with your would-be employers?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAdvertisement,\u201d replied Tuppence promptly. \u201cHave you got a bit of paper\r\nand a pencil? Men usually seem to have. Just like we have hairpins and\r\npowder-puffs.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy handed over a rather shabby green notebook, and Tuppence began\r\nwriting busily.\r\n\r\n\u201cShall we begin: \u2018Young officer, twice wounded in the war----\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, very well, my dear boy. But I can assure you that that sort of\r\nthing might touch the heart of an elderly spinster, and she might adopt\r\nyou, and then there would be no need for you to be a young adventurer at\r\nall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be adopted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI forgot you had a prejudice against it. I was only ragging you!\r\nThe papers are full up to the brim with that type of thing. Now\r\nlisten--how\u2019s this? \u2018Two young adventurers for hire. Willing to do\r\nanything, go anywhere. Pay must be good.\u2019 (We might as well make\r\nthat clear from the start.) Then we might add: \u2018No reasonable offer\r\nrefused\u2019--like flats and furniture.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should think any offer we get in answer to that would be a pretty\r\n_un_reasonable one!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTommy! You\u2019re a genius! That\u2019s ever so much more chic. \u2018No unreasonable\r\noffer refused--if pay is good.\u2019 How\u2019s that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t mention pay again. It looks rather eager.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t look as eager as I feel! But perhaps you are right. Now\r\nI\u2019ll read it straight through. \u2018Two young adventurers for hire. Willing\r\nto do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good. No unreasonable offer\r\nrefused.\u2019 How would that strike you if you read it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would strike me as either being a hoax, or else written by a\r\nlunatic.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not half so insane as a thing I read this morning beginning\r\n\u2018Petunia\u2019 and signed \u2018Best Boy.\u2019\u201d She tore out the leaf and handed it\r\nto Tommy. \u201cThere you are. _Times_, I think. Reply to Box so-and-so.\r\nI expect it will be about five shillings. Here\u2019s half a crown for my\r\nshare.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy was holding the paper thoughtfully. His faced burned a deeper red.\r\n\r\n\u201cShall we really try it?\u201d he said at last. \u201cShall we, Tuppence? Just for\r\nthe fun of the thing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTommy, you\u2019re a sport! I knew you would be! Let\u2019s drink to success.\u201d\r\n She poured some cold dregs of tea into the two cups.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s to our joint venture, and may it prosper!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Young Adventurers, Ltd.!\u201d responded Tommy.\r\n\r\nThey put down the cups and laughed rather uncertainly. Tuppence rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must return to my palatial suite at the hostel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps it is time I strolled round to the _Ritz_,\u201d agreed Tommy with a\r\ngrin. \u201cWhere shall we meet? And when?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTwelve o\u2019clock to-morrow. Piccadilly Tube station. Will that suit you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy time is my own,\u201d replied Mr. Beresford magnificently.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo long, then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-bye, old thing.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe two young people went off in opposite directions. Tuppence\u2019s hostel\r\nwas situated in what was charitably called Southern Belgravia. For\r\nreasons of economy she did not take a bus.\r\n\r\nShe was half-way across St. James\u2019s Park, when a man\u2019s voice behind her\r\nmade her start.\r\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d it said. \u201cBut may I speak to you for a moment?\u201d\r\n\nTUPPENCE turned sharply, but the words hovering on the tip of her tongue\r\nremained unspoken, for the man\u2019s appearance and manner did not bear out\r\nher first and most natural assumption. She hesitated. As if he read her\r\nthoughts, the man said quickly:\r\n\r\n\u201cI can assure you I mean no disrespect.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence believed him. Although she disliked and distrusted him\r\ninstinctively, she was inclined to acquit him of the particular motive\r\nwhich she had at first attributed to him. She looked him up and down. He\r\nwas a big man, clean shaven, with a heavy jowl. His eyes were small and\r\ncunning, and shifted their glance under her direct gaze.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what is it?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\nThe man smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cI happened to overhear part of your conversation with the young\r\ngentleman in Lyons\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell--what of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing--except that I think I may be of some use to you.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother inference forced itself into Tuppence\u2019s mind:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou followed me here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI took that liberty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd in what way do you think you could be of use to me?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man took a card from his pocket and handed it to her with a bow.\r\n\r\nTuppence took it and scrutinized it carefully. It bore the inscription,\r\n\u201cMr. Edward Whittington.\u201d Below the name were the words \u201cEsthonia\r\nGlassware Co.,\u201d and the address of a city office. Mr. Whittington spoke\r\nagain:\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you will call upon me to-morrow morning at eleven o\u2019clock, I will\r\nlay the details of my proposition before you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt eleven o\u2019clock?\u201d said Tuppence doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt eleven o\u2019clock.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence made up her mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. Good evening.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe raised his hat with a flourish, and walked away. Tuppence remained\r\nfor some minutes gazing after him. Then she gave a curious movement of\r\nher shoulders, rather as a terrier shakes himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe adventures have begun,\u201d she murmured to herself. \u201cWhat does he want\r\nme to do, I wonder? There\u2019s something about you, Mr. Whittington, that I\r\ndon\u2019t like at all. But, on the other hand, I\u2019m not the least bit afraid\r\nof you. And as I\u2019ve said before, and shall doubtless say again, little\r\nTuppence can look after herself, thank you!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd with a short, sharp nod of her head she walked briskly onward. As a\r\nresult of further meditations, however, she turned aside from the direct\r\nroute and entered a post office. There she pondered for some moments,\r\na telegraph form in her hand. The thought of a possible five shillings\r\nspent unnecessarily spurred her to action, and she decided to risk the\r\nwaste of ninepence.\r\n\r\nDisdaining the spiky pen and thick, black treacle which a beneficent\r\nGovernment had provided, Tuppence drew out Tommy\u2019s pencil which she had\r\nretained and wrote rapidly: \u201cDon\u2019t put in advertisement. Will explain\r\nto-morrow.\u201d She addressed it to Tommy at his club, from which in one\r\nshort month he would have to resign, unless a kindly fortune permitted\r\nhim to renew his subscription.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may catch him,\u201d she murmured. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s worth trying.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter handing it over the counter she set out briskly for home, stopping\r\nat a baker\u2019s to buy three penny-worth of new buns.\r\n\r\nLater, in her tiny cubicle at the top of the house she munched buns and\r\nreflected on the future. What was the Esthonia Glassware Co., and what\r\nearthly need could it have for her services? A pleasurable thrill of\r\nexcitement made Tuppence tingle. At any rate, the country vicarage had\r\nretreated into the background again. The morrow held possibilities.\r\n\r\nIt was a long time before Tuppence went to sleep that night, and, when\r\nat length she did, she dreamed that Mr. Whittington had set her to\r\nwashing up a pile of Esthonia Glassware, which bore an unaccountable\r\nresemblance to hospital plates!\r\n\r\nIt wanted some five minutes to eleven when Tuppence reached the block\r\nof buildings in which the offices of the Esthonia Glassware Co. were\r\nsituated. To arrive before the time would look over-eager. So Tuppence\r\ndecided to walk to the end of the street and back again. She did so. On\r\nthe stroke of eleven she plunged into the recesses of the building.\r\nThe Esthonia Glassware Co. was on the top floor. There was a lift, but\r\nTuppence chose to walk up.\r\n\r\nSlightly out of breath, she came to a halt outside the ground glass door\r\nwith the legend painted across it \u201cEsthonia Glassware Co.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence knocked. In response to a voice from within, she turned the\r\nhandle and walked into a small rather dirty outer office.\r\n\r\nA middle-aged clerk got down from a high stool at a desk near the window\r\nand came towards her inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have an appointment with Mr. Whittington,\u201d said Tuppence.\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you come this way, please.\u201d He crossed to a partition door with\r\n\u201cPrivate\u201d on it, knocked, then opened the door and stood aside to let\r\nher pass in.\r\n\r\nMr. Whittington was seated behind a large desk covered with papers.\r\nTuppence felt her previous judgment confirmed. There was something wrong\r\nabout Mr. Whittington. The combination of his sleek prosperity and his\r\nshifty eye was not attractive.\r\n\r\nHe looked up and nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve turned up all right? That\u2019s good. Sit down, will you?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence sat down on the chair facing him. She looked particularly small\r\nand demure this morning. She sat there meekly with downcast eyes whilst\r\nMr. Whittington sorted and rustled amongst his papers. Finally he pushed\r\nthem away, and leaned over the desk.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, my dear young lady, let us come to business.\u201d His large face\r\nbroadened into a smile. \u201cYou want work? Well, I have work to offer\r\nyou. What should you say now to \u00a3100 down, and all expenses paid?\u201d Mr.\r\nWhittington leaned back in his chair, and thrust his thumbs into the\r\narm-holes of his waistcoat.\r\n\r\nTuppence eyed him warily.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the nature of the work?\u201d she demanded.\r\n\r\n\u201cNominal--purely nominal. A pleasant trip, that is all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere to?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Whittington smiled again.\r\n\r\n\u201cParis.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Tuppence thoughtfully. To herself she said: \u201cOf course,\r\nif father heard that he would have a fit! But somehow I don\u2019t see Mr.\r\nWhittington in the role of the gay deceiver.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d continued Whittington. \u201cWhat could be more delightful? To put the\r\nclock back a few years--a very few, I am sure--and re-enter one of those\r\ncharming _pensionnats de jeunes filles_ with which Paris abounds----\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\u201cA _pensionnat?_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. Madame Colombier\u2019s in the Avenue de Neuilly.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence knew the name well. Nothing could have been more select. She\r\nhad had several American friends there. She was more than ever puzzled.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou want me to go to Madame Colombier\u2019s? For how long?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat depends. Possibly three months.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that is all? There are no other conditions?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone whatever. You would, of course, go in the character of my ward,\r\nand you would hold no communication with your friends. I should have\r\nto request absolute secrecy for the time being. By the way, you are\r\nEnglish, are you not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYet you speak with a slight American accent?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy great pal in hospital was a little American girl. I dare say I\r\npicked it up from her. I can soon get out of it again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, it might be simpler for you to pass as an American.\r\nDetails about your past life in England might be more difficult to\r\nsustain. Yes, I think that would be decidedly better. Then----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne moment, Mr. Whittington! You seem to be taking my consent for\r\ngranted.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhittington looked surprised.\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely you are not thinking of refusing? I can assure you that Madame\r\nColombier\u2019s is a most high-class and orthodox establishment. And the\r\nterms are most liberal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Tuppence. \u201cThat\u2019s just it. The terms are almost too\r\nliberal, Mr. Whittington. I cannot see any way in which I can be worth\r\nthat amount of money to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo?\u201d said Whittington softly. \u201cWell, I will tell you. I could doubtless\r\nobtain some one else for very much less. What I am willing to pay for\r\nis a young lady with sufficient intelligence and presence of mind to\r\nsustain her part well, and also one who will have sufficient discretion\r\nnot to ask too many questions.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence smiled a little. She felt that Whittington had scored.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s another thing. So far there has been no mention of Mr.\r\nBeresford. Where does he come in?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Beresford?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy partner,\u201d said Tuppence with dignity. \u201cYou saw us together\r\nyesterday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes. But I\u2019m afraid we shan\u2019t require his services.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen it\u2019s off!\u201d Tuppence rose. \u201cIt\u2019s both or neither. Sorry--but that\u2019s\r\nhow it is. Good morning, Mr. Whittington.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWait a minute. Let us see if something can\u2019t be managed. Sit down\r\nagain, Miss----\u201d He paused interrogatively.\r\n\r\nTuppence\u2019s conscience gave her a passing twinge as she remembered the\r\narchdeacon. She seized hurriedly on the first name that came into her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\u201cJane Finn,\u201d she said hastily; and then paused open-mouthed at the\r\neffect of those two simple words.\r\n\r\nAll the geniality had faded out of Whittington\u2019s face. It was purple\r\nwith rage, and the veins stood out on the forehead. And behind it all\r\nthere lurked a sort of incredulous dismay. He leaned forward and hissed\r\nsavagely:\r\n\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s your little game, is it?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence, though utterly taken aback, nevertheless kept her head. She\r\nhad not the faintest comprehension of his meaning, but she was naturally\r\nquick-witted, and felt it imperative to \u201ckeep her end up\u201d as she phrased\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhittington went on:\r\n\r\n\u201cBeen playing with me, have you, all the time, like a cat and mouse?\r\nKnew all the time what I wanted you for, but kept up the comedy. Is that\r\nit, eh?\u201d He was cooling down. The red colour was ebbing out of his face.\r\nHe eyed her keenly. \u201cWho\u2019s been blabbing? Rita?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence shook her head. She was doubtful as to how long she could\r\nsustain this illusion, but she realized the importance of not dragging\r\nan unknown Rita into it.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she replied with perfect truth. \u201cRita knows nothing about me.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis eyes still bored into her like gimlets.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow much do you know?\u201d he shot out.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery little indeed,\u201d answered Tuppence, and was pleased to note that\r\nWhittington\u2019s uneasiness was augmented instead of allayed. To have\r\nboasted that she knew a lot might have raised doubts in his mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d snarled Whittington, \u201cyou knew enough to come in here and\r\nplump out that name.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt might be my own name,\u201d Tuppence pointed out.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely, isn\u2019t it, then there would be two girls with a name like\r\nthat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOr I might just have hit upon it by chance,\u201d continued Tuppence,\r\nintoxicated with the success of truthfulness.\r\n\r\nMr. Whittington brought his fist down upon the desk with a bang.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuit fooling! How much do you know? And how much do you want?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe last five words took Tuppence\u2019s fancy mightily, especially after a\r\nmeagre breakfast and a supper of buns the night before. Her present part\r\nwas of the adventuress rather than the adventurous order, but she did\r\nnot deny its possibilities. She sat up and smiled with the air of one\r\nwho has the situation thoroughly well in hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Mr. Whittington,\u201d she said, \u201clet us by all means lay our cards\r\nupon the table. And pray do not be so angry. You heard me say yesterday\r\nthat I proposed to live by my wits. It seems to me that I have now\r\nproved I have some wits to live by! I admit I have knowledge of a\r\ncertain name, but perhaps my knowledge ends there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes--and perhaps it doesn\u2019t,\u201d snarled Whittington.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou insist on misjudging me,\u201d said Tuppence, and sighed gently.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I said once before,\u201d said Whittington angrily, \u201cquit fooling, and\r\ncome to the point. You can\u2019t play the innocent with me. You know a great\r\ndeal more than you\u2019re willing to admit.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence paused a moment to admire her own ingenuity, and then said\r\nsoftly:\r\n\r\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t like to contradict you, Mr. Whittington.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo we come to the usual question--how much?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence was in a dilemma. So far she had fooled Whittington with\r\ncomplete success, but to mention a palpably impossible sum might awaken\r\nhis suspicions. An idea flashed across her brain.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuppose we say a little something down, and a fuller discussion of the\r\nmatter later?\u201d\r\n\r\nWhittington gave her an ugly glance.\r\n\r\n\u201cBlackmail, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence smiled sweetly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no! Shall we say payment of services in advance?\u201d\r\n\r\nWhittington grunted.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d explained Tuppence still sweetly, \u201cI\u2019m so very fond of\r\nmoney!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re about the limit, that\u2019s what you are,\u201d growled Whittington, with\r\na sort of unwilling admiration. \u201cYou took me in all right. Thought you\r\nwere quite a meek little kid with just enough brains for my purpose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLife,\u201d moralized Tuppence, \u201cis full of surprises.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll the same,\u201d continued Whittington, \u201csome one\u2019s been talking. You say\r\nit isn\u2019t Rita. Was it----? Oh, come in.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe clerk followed his discreet knock into the room, and laid a paper at\r\nhis master\u2019s elbow.\r\n\r\n\u201cTelephone message just come for you, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhittington snatched it up and read it. A frown gathered on his brow.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019ll do, Brown. You can go.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe clerk withdrew, closing the door behind him. Whittington turned to\r\nTuppence.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome to-morrow at the same time. I\u2019m busy now. Here\u2019s fifty to go on\r\nwith.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe rapidly sorted out some notes, and pushed them across the table to\r\nTuppence, then stood up, obviously impatient for her to go.\r\n\r\nThe girl counted the notes in a businesslike manner, secured them in her\r\nhandbag, and rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood morning, Mr. Whittington,\u201d she said politely. \u201cAt least, au\r\nrevoir, I should say.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. Au revoir!\u201d Whittington looked almost genial again, a\r\nreversion that aroused in Tuppence a faint misgiving. \u201cAu revoir, my\r\nclever and charming young lady.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence sped lightly down the stairs. A wild elation possessed her. A\r\nneighbouring clock showed the time to be five minutes to twelve.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s give Tommy a surprise!\u201d murmured Tuppence, and hailed a taxi.\r\n\r\nThe cab drew up outside the tube station. Tommy was just within the\r\nentrance. His eyes opened to their fullest extent as he hurried forward\r\nto assist Tuppence to alight. She smiled at him affectionately, and\r\nremarked in a slightly affected voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cPay the thing, will you, old bean? I\u2019ve got nothing smaller than a\r\nfive-pound note!\u201d\r\n\nTHE moment was not quite so triumphant as it ought to have been. To\r\nbegin with, the resources of Tommy\u2019s pockets were somewhat limited. In\r\nthe end the fare was managed, the lady recollecting a plebeian twopence,\r\nand the driver, still holding the varied assortment of coins in his\r\nhand, was prevailed upon to move on, which he did after one last hoarse\r\ndemand as to what the gentleman thought he was giving him?\r\n\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve given him too much, Tommy,\u201d said Tuppence innocently. \u201cI\r\nfancy he wants to give some of it back.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was possibly this remark which induced the driver to move away.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Mr. Beresford, at length able to relieve his feelings,\r\n\u201cwhat the--dickens, did you want to take a taxi for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was afraid I might be late and keep you waiting,\u201d said Tuppence\r\ngently.\r\n\r\n\u201cAfraid--you--might--be--late! Oh, Lord, I give it up!\u201d said Mr.\r\nBeresford.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd really and truly,\u201d continued Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide,\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got anything smaller than a five-pound note.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did that part of it very well, old bean, but all the same the\r\nfellow wasn\u2019t taken in--not for a moment!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Tuppence thoughtfully, \u201che didn\u2019t believe it. That\u2019s the\r\ncurious part about speaking the truth. No one does believe it. I found\r\nthat out this morning. Now let\u2019s go to lunch. How about the _Savoy?_\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy grinned.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow about the _Ritz?_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn second thoughts, I prefer the _Piccadilly_. It\u2019s nearer. We shan\u2019t\r\nhave to take another taxi. Come along.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs this a new brand of humour? Or is your brain really unhinged?\u201d\r\n inquired Tommy.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour last supposition is the correct one. I have come into money, and\r\nthe shock has been too much for me! For that particular form of mental\r\ntrouble an eminent physician recommends unlimited _Hors d\u2019\u0153uvre_,\r\nLobster _\u00e0 l\u2019am\u00e9ricane_, Chicken Newberg, and P\u00eache Melba! Let\u2019s go\r\nand get them!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTuppence, old girl, what has really come over you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, unbelieving one!\u201d Tuppence wrenched open her bag. \u201cLook here, and\r\nhere, and here!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGreat Jehosaphat! My dear girl, don\u2019t wave Fishers aloft like that!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re not Fishers. They\u2019re five times better than Fishers, and this\r\none\u2019s ten times better!\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy groaned.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must have been drinking unawares! Am I dreaming, Tuppence, or do I\r\nreally behold a large quantity of five-pound notes being waved about in\r\na dangerous fashion?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEven so, O King! _Now_, will you come and have lunch?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll come anywhere. But what have you been doing? Holding up a bank?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll in good time. What an awful place Piccadilly Circus is. There\u2019s a\r\nhuge bus bearing down on us. It would be too terrible if they killed the\r\nfive-pound notes!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGrill room?\u201d inquired Tommy, as they reached the opposite pavement in\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe other\u2019s more expensive,\u201d demurred Tuppence.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s mere wicked wanton extravagance. Come on below.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you sure I can get all the things I want there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat extremely unwholesome menu you were outlining just now? Of course\r\nyou can--or as much as is good for you, anyway.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now tell me,\u201d said Tommy, unable to restrain his pent-up curiosity\r\nany longer, as they sat in state surrounded by the many _hors d\u2019\u0153uvre_\r\nof Tuppence\u2019s dreams.\r\n\r\nMiss Cowley told him.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the curious part of it is,\u201d she ended, \u201cthat I really did invent\r\nthe name of Jane Finn! I didn\u2019t want to give my own because of poor\r\nfather--in case I should get mixed up in anything shady.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps that\u2019s so,\u201d said Tommy slowly. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t invent it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. _I_ told it to you. Don\u2019t you remember, I said yesterday I\u2019d\r\noverheard two people talking about a female called Jane Finn? That\u2019s\r\nwhat brought the name into your mind so pat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you did. I remember now. How extraordinary----\u201d Tuppence tailed off\r\ninto silence. Suddenly she aroused herself. \u201cTommy!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat were they like, the two men you passed?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy frowned in an effort at remembrance.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne was a big fat sort of chap. Clean shaven, I think--and dark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s him,\u201d cried Tuppence, in an ungrammatical squeal. \u201cThat\u2019s\r\nWhittington! What was the other man like?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember. I didn\u2019t notice him particularly. It was really the\r\noutlandish name that caught my attention.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd people say that coincidences don\u2019t happen!\u201d Tuppence tackled her\r\nP\u00eache Melba happily.\r\n\r\nBut Tommy had become serious.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here, Tuppence, old girl, what is this going to lead to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMore money,\u201d replied his companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know that. You\u2019ve only got one idea in your head. What I mean is,\r\nwhat about the next step? How are you going to keep the game up?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Tuppence laid down her spoon. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Tommy, it is a bit of\r\na poser.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter all, you know, you can\u2019t bluff him forever. You\u2019re sure to slip\r\nup sooner or later. And, anyway, I\u2019m not at all sure that it isn\u2019t\r\nactionable--blackmail, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNonsense. Blackmail is saying you\u2019ll tell unless you are given\r\nmoney. Now, there\u2019s nothing I could tell, because I don\u2019t really know\r\nanything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHm,\u201d said Tommy doubtfully. \u201cWell, anyway, what _are_ we going to do?\r\nWhittington was in a hurry to get rid of you this morning, but next time\r\nhe\u2019ll want to know something more before he parts with his money. He\u2019ll\r\nwant to know how much _you_ know, and where you got your information\r\nfrom, and a lot of other things that you can\u2019t cope with. What are you\r\ngoing to do about it?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence frowned severely.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must think. Order some Turkish coffee, Tommy. Stimulating to the\r\nbrain. Oh, dear, what a lot I have eaten!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have made rather a hog of yourself! So have I for that matter, but\r\nI flatter myself that my choice of dishes was more judicious than yours.\r\nTwo coffees.\u201d (This was to the waiter.) \u201cOne Turkish, one French.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence sipped her coffee with a deeply reflective air, and snubbed\r\nTommy when he spoke to her.\r\n\r\n\u201cBe quiet. I\u2019m thinking.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShades of Pelmanism!\u201d said Tommy, and relapsed into silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere!\u201d said Tuppence at last. \u201cI\u2019ve got a plan. Obviously what we\u2019ve\r\ngot to do is to find out more about it all.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy applauded.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t jeer. We can only find out through Whittington. We must discover\r\nwhere he lives, what he does--sleuth him, in fact! Now I can\u2019t do it,\r\nbecause he knows me, but he only saw you for a minute or two in Lyons\u2019.\r\nHe\u2019s not likely to recognize you. After all, one young man is much like\r\nanother.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI repudiate that remark utterly. I\u2019m sure my pleasing features and\r\ndistinguished appearance would single me out from any crowd.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy plan is this,\u201d Tuppence went on calmly, \u201cI\u2019ll go alone to-morrow.\r\nI\u2019ll put him off again like I did to-day. It doesn\u2019t matter if I don\u2019t\r\nget any more money at once. Fifty pounds ought to last us a few days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOr even longer!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll hang about outside. When I come out I shan\u2019t speak to you in\r\ncase he\u2019s watching. But I\u2019ll take up my stand somewhere near, and when\r\nhe comes out of the building I\u2019ll drop a handkerchief or something, and\r\noff you go!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOff I go where?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFollow him, of course, silly! What do you think of the idea?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSort of thing one reads about in books. I somehow feel that in real\r\nlife one will feel a bit of an ass standing in the street for hours with\r\nnothing to do. People will wonder what I\u2019m up to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot in the city. Every one\u2019s in such a hurry. Probably no one will even\r\nnotice you at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the second time you\u2019ve made that sort of remark. Never mind, I\r\nforgive you. Anyway, it will be rather a lark. What are you doing this\r\nafternoon?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Tuppence meditatively. \u201cI _had_ thought of hats! Or perhaps\r\nsilk stockings! Or perhaps----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHold hard,\u201d admonished Tommy. \u201cThere\u2019s a limit to fifty pounds! But\r\nlet\u2019s do dinner and a show to-night at all events.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRather.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe day passed pleasantly. The evening even more so. Two of the\r\nfive-pound notes were now irretrievably dead.\r\n\r\nThey met by arrangement the following morning and proceeded citywards.\r\nTommy remained on the opposite side of the road while Tuppence plunged\r\ninto the building.\r\n\r\nTommy strolled slowly down to the end of the street, then back again.\r\nJust as he came abreast of the building, Tuppence darted across the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n\u201cTommy!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. What\u2019s up?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe place is shut. I can\u2019t make anyone hear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s odd.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it? Come up with me, and let\u2019s try again.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy followed her. As they passed the third floor landing a young clerk\r\ncame out of an office. He hesitated a moment, then addressed himself to\r\nTuppence.\r\n\r\n\u201cWere you wanting the Esthonia Glassware?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, please.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s closed down. Since yesterday afternoon. Company being wound up,\r\nthey say. Not that I\u2019ve ever heard of it myself. But anyway the office\r\nis to let.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTh--thank you,\u201d faltered Tuppence. \u201cI suppose you don\u2019t know Mr.\r\nWhittington\u2019s address?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAfraid I don\u2019t. They left rather suddenly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you very much,\u201d said Tommy. \u201cCome on, Tuppence.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey descended to the street again where they gazed at one another\r\nblankly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s torn it,\u201d said Tommy at length.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I never suspected it,\u201d wailed Tuppence.\r\n\r\n\u201cCheer up, old thing, it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t it, though!\u201d Tuppence\u2019s little chin shot out defiantly. \u201cDo you\r\nthink this is the end? If so, you\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s just the beginning!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe beginning of what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf our adventure! Tommy, don\u2019t you see, if they are scared enough to\r\nrun away like this, it shows that there must be a lot in this Jane Finn\r\nbusiness! Well, we\u2019ll get to the bottom of it. We\u2019ll run them down!\r\nWe\u2019ll be sleuths in earnest!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but there\u2019s no one left to sleuth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s why we\u2019ll have to start all over again. Lend me that bit of\r\npencil. Thanks. Wait a minute--don\u2019t interrupt. There!\u201d Tuppence handed\r\nback the pencil, and surveyed the piece of paper on which she had\r\nwritten with a satisfied eye:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAdvertisement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to put that thing in after all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s a different one.\u201d She handed him the slip of paper.\r\n\r\nTommy read the words on it aloud:\r\n\r\n\u201cWANTED, any information respecting Jane Finn. Apply Y. A.\u201d\r\n\nTHE next day passed slowly. It was necessary to curtail expenditure.\r\nCarefully husbanded, forty pounds will last a long time. Luckily the\r\nweather was fine, and \u201cwalking is cheap,\u201d dictated Tuppence. An outlying\r\npicture house provided them with recreation for the evening.\r\n\r\nThe day of disillusionment had been a Wednesday. On Thursday the\r\nadvertisement had duly appeared. On Friday letters might be expected to\r\narrive at Tommy\u2019s rooms.\r\n\r\nHe had been bound by an honourable promise not to open any such letters\r\nif they did arrive, but to repair to the National Gallery, where his\r\ncolleague would meet him at ten o\u2019clock.\r\n\r\nTuppence was first at the rendezvous. She ensconced herself on a red\r\nvelvet seat, and gazed at the Turners with unseeing eyes until she saw\r\nthe familiar figure enter the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d returned Mr. Beresford provokingly. \u201cWhich is your favourite\r\npicture?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a wretch. Aren\u2019t there _any_ answers?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy shook his head with a deep and somewhat overacted melancholy.\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to disappoint you, old thing, by telling you right off.\r\nIt\u2019s too bad. Good money wasted.\u201d He sighed. \u201cStill, there it is. The\r\nadvertisement has appeared, and--there are only two answers!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTommy, you devil!\u201d almost screamed Tuppence. \u201cGive them to me. How\r\ncould you be so mean!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour language, Tuppence, your language! They\u2019re very particular at the\r\nNational Gallery. Government show, you know. And do remember, as I have\r\npointed out to you before, that as a clergyman\u2019s daughter----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI ought to be on the stage!\u201d finished Tuppence with a snap.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is not what I intended to say. But if you are sure that you have\r\nenjoyed to the full the reaction of joy after despair with which I have\r\nkindly provided you free of charge, let us get down to our mail, as the\r\nsaying goes.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence snatched the two precious envelopes from him unceremoniously,\r\nand scrutinized them carefully.\r\n\r\n\u201cThick paper, this one. It looks rich. We\u2019ll keep it to the last and\r\nopen the other first.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRight you are. One, two, three, go!\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence\u2019s little thumb ripped open the envelope, and she extracted the\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\n\u201cDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\u201cReferring to your advertisement in this morning\u2019s paper, I may be able\r\nto be of some use to you. Perhaps you could call and see me at the above\r\naddress at eleven o\u2019clock to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\n\u201cYours truly,\r\n\r\n\u201cA. CARTER.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c27 Carshalton Gardens,\u201d said Tuppence, referring to the address.\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Gloucester Road way. Plenty of time to get there if we tube.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe following,\u201d said Tommy, \u201cis the plan of campaign. It is my turn to\r\nassume the offensive. Ushered into the presence of Mr. Carter, he and I\r\nwish each other good morning as is customary. He then says: \u2018Please take\r\na seat, Mr.--er?\u2019 To which I reply promptly and significantly: \u2018Edward\r\nWhittington!\u2019 whereupon Mr. Carter turns purple in the face and gasps\r\nout: \u2018How much?\u2019 Pocketing the usual fee of fifty pounds, I rejoin you\r\nin the road outside, and we proceed to the next address and repeat the\r\nperformance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd, Tommy. Now for the other letter. Oh, this is from the\r\n_Ritz!_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA hundred pounds instead of fifty!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll read it:\r\n\r\n\u201cDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\u201cRe your advertisement, I should be glad if you would call round\r\nsomewhere about lunch-time.\r\n\r\n\u201cYours truly,\r\n\r\n\u201cJULIUS P. HERSHEIMMER.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d said Tommy. \u201cDo I smell a Boche? Or only an American millionaire\r\nof unfortunate ancestry? At all events we\u2019ll call at lunch-time. It\u2019s a\r\ngood time--frequently leads to free food for two.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence nodded assent.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow for Carter. We\u2019ll have to hurry.\u201d\r\n\r\nCarshalton Terrace proved to be an unimpeachable row of what Tuppence\r\ncalled \u201cladylike looking houses.\u201d They rang the bell at No. 27, and a\r\nneat maid answered the door. She looked so respectable that Tuppence\u2019s\r\nheart sank. Upon Tommy\u2019s request for Mr. Carter, she showed them into\r\na small study on the ground floor where she left them. Hardly a minute\r\nelapsed, however, before the door opened, and a tall man with a lean\r\nhawklike face and a tired manner entered the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Y. A.?\u201d he said, and smiled. His smile was distinctly attractive.\r\n\u201cDo sit down, both of you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey obeyed. He himself took a chair opposite to Tuppence and smiled at\r\nher encouragingly. There was something in the quality of his smile that\r\nmade the girl\u2019s usual readiness desert her.\r\n\r\nAs he did not seem inclined to open the conversation, Tuppence was\r\nforced to begin.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe wanted to know--that is, would you be so kind as to tell us anything\r\nyou know about Jane Finn?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJane Finn? Ah!\u201d Mr. Carter appeared to reflect. \u201cWell, the question is,\r\nwhat do _you_ know about her?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence drew herself up.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that that\u2019s got anything to do with it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo? But it has, you know, really it has.\u201d He smiled again in his tired\r\nway, and continued reflectively. \u201cSo that brings us down to it again.\r\nWhat do _you_ know about Jane Finn?\r\n\r\n\u201cCome now,\u201d he continued, as Tuppence remained silent. \u201cYou must know\r\n_something_ to have advertised as you did?\u201d He leaned forward a little,\r\nhis weary voice held a hint of persuasiveness. \u201cSuppose you tell me....\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was something very magnetic about Mr. Carter\u2019s personality.\r\nTuppence seemed to shake herself free of it with an effort, as she said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t do that, could we, Tommy?\u201d\r\n\r\nBut to her surprise, her companion did not back her up. His eyes were\r\nfixed on Mr. Carter, and his tone when he spoke held an unusual note of\r\ndeference.\r\n\r\n\u201cI dare say the little we know won\u2019t be any good to you, sir. But such\r\nas it is, you\u2019re welcome to it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTommy!\u201d cried out Tuppence in surprise.\r\n\r\nMr. Carter slewed round in his chair. His eyes asked a question.\r\n\r\nTommy nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, I recognized you at once. Saw you in France when I was with\r\nthe Intelligence. As soon as you came into the room, I knew----\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Carter held up his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo names, please. I\u2019m known as Mr. Carter here. It\u2019s my cousin\u2019s house,\r\nby the way. She\u2019s willing to lend it to me sometimes when it\u2019s a case of\r\nworking on strictly unofficial lines. Well, now\u201d--he looked from one to\r\nthe other--\u201cwho\u2019s going to tell me the story?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFire ahead, Tuppence,\u201d directed Tommy. \u201cIt\u2019s your yarn.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, little lady, out with it.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd obediently Tuppence did out with it, telling the whole story from\r\nthe forming of the Young Adventurers, Ltd., downwards.\r\n\r\nMr. Carter listened in silence with a resumption of his tired manner.\r\nNow and then he passed his hand across his lips as though to hide a\r\nsmile. When she had finished he nodded gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot much. But suggestive. Quite suggestive. If you\u2019ll excuse my saying\r\nso, you\u2019re a curious young couple. I don\u2019t know--you might succeed where\r\nothers have failed ... I believe in luck, you know--always have....\u201d\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, and then went on.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, how about it? You\u2019re out for adventure. How would you like\r\nto work for me? All quite unofficial, you know. Expenses paid, and a\r\nmoderate screw?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence gazed at him, her lips parted, her eyes growing wider and\r\nwider.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat should we have to do?\u201d she breathed.\r\n\r\nMr. Carter smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust go on with what you\u2019re doing now. _Find Jane Finn_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but--who _is_ Jane Finn?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Carter nodded gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, you\u2019re entitled to know that, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe leaned back in his chair, crossed his legs, brought the tips of his\r\nfingers together, and began in a low monotone:\r\n\r\n\u201cSecret diplomacy (which, by the way, is nearly always bad policy!) does\r\nnot concern you. It will be sufficient to say that in the early days of\r\n1915 a certain document came into being. It was the draft of a secret\r\nagreement--treaty--call it what you like. It was drawn up ready for\r\nsignature by the various representatives, and drawn up in America--at\r\nthat time a neutral country. It was dispatched to England by a special\r\nmessenger selected for that purpose, a young fellow called Danvers. It\r\nwas hoped that the whole affair had been kept so secret that nothing\r\nwould have leaked out. That kind of hope is usually disappointed.\r\nSomebody always talks!\r\n\r\n\u201cDanvers sailed for England on the _Lusitania_. He carried the precious\r\npapers in an oilskin packet which he wore next his skin. It was on that\r\nparticular voyage that the _Lusitania_ was torpedoed and sunk. Danvers\r\nwas among the list of those missing. Eventually his body was washed\r\nashore, and identified beyond any possible doubt. But the oilskin packet\r\nwas missing!\r\n\r\n\u201cThe question was, had it been taken from him, or had he himself\r\npassed it on into another\u2019s keeping? There were a few incidents that\r\nstrengthened the possibility of the latter theory. After the torpedo\r\nstruck the ship, in the few moments during the launching of the boats,\r\nDanvers was seen speaking to a young American girl. No one actually\r\nsaw him pass anything to her, but he might have done so. It seems to me\r\nquite likely that he entrusted the papers to this girl, believing that\r\nshe, as a woman, had a greater chance of bringing them safely to shore.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut if so, where was the girl, and what had she done with the papers?\r\nBy later advice from America it seemed likely that Danvers had been\r\nclosely shadowed on the way over. Was this girl in league with his\r\nenemies? Or had she, in her turn, been shadowed and either tricked or\r\nforced into handing over the precious packet?\r\n\r\n\u201cWe set to work to trace her out. It proved unexpectedly difficult.\r\nHer name was Jane Finn, and it duly appeared among the list of the\r\nsurvivors, but the girl herself seemed to have vanished completely.\r\nInquiries into her antecedents did little to help us. She was an orphan,\r\nand had been what we should call over here a pupil teacher in a small\r\nschool out West. Her passport had been made out for Paris, where she\r\nwas going to join the staff of a hospital. She had offered her services\r\nvoluntarily, and after some correspondence they had been accepted.\r\nHaving seen her name in the list of the saved from the _Lusitania_, the\r\nstaff of the hospital were naturally very surprised at her not arriving\r\nto take up her billet, and at not hearing from her in any way.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, every effort was made to trace the young lady--but all in vain.\r\nWe tracked her across Ireland, but nothing could be heard of her after\r\nshe set foot in England. No use was made of the draft treaty--as might\r\nvery easily have been done--and we therefore came to the conclusion that\r\nDanvers had, after all, destroyed it. The war entered on another phase,\r\nthe diplomatic aspect changed accordingly, and the treaty was never\r\nredrafted. Rumours as to its existence were emphatically denied. The\r\ndisappearance of Jane Finn was forgotten and the whole affair was lost\r\nin oblivion.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Carter paused, and Tuppence broke in impatiently:\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why has it all cropped up again? The war\u2019s over.\u201d\r\n\r\nA hint of alertness came into Mr. Carter\u2019s manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause it seems that the papers were not destroyed after all, and that\r\nthey might be resurrected to-day with a new and deadly significance.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence stared. Mr. Carter nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, five years ago, that draft treaty was a weapon in our hands;\r\nto-day it is a weapon against us. It was a gigantic blunder. If its\r\nterms were made public, it would mean disaster.... It might possibly\r\nbring about another war--not with Germany this time! That is an extreme\r\npossibility, and I do not believe in its likelihood myself, but that\r\ndocument undoubtedly implicates a number of our statesmen whom we cannot\r\nafford to have discredited in any way at the present moment. As a party\r\ncry for Labour it would be irresistible, and a Labour Government at this\r\njuncture would, in my opinion, be a grave disability for British trade,\r\nbut that is a mere nothing to the _real_ danger.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe paused, and then said quietly:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may perhaps have heard or read that there is Bolshevist influence\r\nat work behind the present Labour unrest?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is the truth. Bolshevist gold is pouring into this country for the\r\nspecific purpose of procuring a Revolution. And there is a certain man,\r\na man whose real name is unknown to us, who is working in the dark for\r\nhis own ends. The Bolshevists are behind the Labour unrest--but this\r\nman is _behind the Bolshevists_. Who is he? We do not know. He is always\r\nspoken of by the unassuming title of \u2018Mr. Brown.\u2019 But one thing is\r\ncertain, he is the master criminal of this age. He controls a marvellous\r\norganization. Most of the Peace propaganda during the war was originated\r\nand financed by him. His spies are everywhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA naturalized German?\u201d asked Tommy.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, I have every reason to believe he is an Englishman. He\r\nwas pro-German, as he would have been pro-Boer. What he seeks to attain\r\nwe do not know--probably supreme power for himself, of a kind unique in\r\nhistory. We have no clue as to his real personality. It is reported that\r\neven his own followers are ignorant of it. Where we have come across his\r\ntracks, he has always played a secondary part. Somebody else assumes\r\nthe chief r\u00f4le. But afterwards we always find that there has been some\r\nnonentity, a servant or a clerk, who has remained in the background\r\nunnoticed, and that the elusive Mr. Brown has escaped us once more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Tuppence jumped. \u201cI wonder----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI remember in Mr. Whittington\u2019s office. The clerk--he called him Brown.\r\nYou don\u2019t think----\u201d\r\n\r\nCarter nodded thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery likely. A curious point is that the name is usually mentioned. An\r\nidiosyncrasy of genius. Can you describe him at all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t notice. He was quite ordinary--just like anyone else.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Carter sighed in his tired manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is the invariable description of Mr. Brown! Brought a telephone\r\nmessage to the man Whittington, did he? Notice a telephone in the outer\r\noffice?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence thought.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. That \u2018message\u2019 was Mr. Brown\u2019s way of giving an order to his\r\nsubordinate. He overheard the whole conversation of course. Was it after\r\nthat that Whittington handed you over the money, and told you to come\r\nthe following day?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, undoubtedly the hand of Mr. Brown!\u201d Mr. Carter paused. \u201cWell,\r\nthere it is, you see what you are pitting yourselves against? Possibly\r\nthe finest criminal brain of the age. I don\u2019t quite like it, you know.\r\nYou\u2019re such young things, both of you. I shouldn\u2019t like anything to\r\nhappen to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt won\u2019t,\u201d Tuppence assured him positively.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll look after her, sir,\u201d said Tommy.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd _I_\u2018ll look after _you_,\u201d retorted Tuppence, resenting the manly\r\nassertion.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, look after each other,\u201d said Mr. Carter, smiling. \u201cNow\r\nlet\u2019s get back to business. There\u2019s something mysterious about this\r\ndraft treaty that we haven\u2019t fathomed yet. We\u2019ve been threatened with\r\nit--in plain and unmistakable terms. The Revolutionary element as good\r\nas declare that it\u2019s in their hands, and that they intend to produce it\r\nat a given moment. On the other hand, they are clearly at fault about\r\nmany of its provisions. The Government consider it as mere bluff\r\non their part, and, rightly or wrongly, have stuck to the policy of\r\nabsolute denial. I\u2019m not so sure. There have been hints, indiscreet\r\nallusions, that seem to indicate that the menace is a real one. The\r\nposition is much as though they had got hold of an incriminating\r\ndocument, but couldn\u2019t read it because it was in cipher--but we know\r\nthat the draft treaty wasn\u2019t in cipher--couldn\u2019t be in the nature of\r\nthings--so that won\u2019t wash. But there\u2019s _something_. Of course, Jane\r\nFinn may be dead for all we know--but I don\u2019t think so. The curious\r\nthing is that _they\u2019re trying to get information about the girl from\r\nus_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. One or two little things have cropped up. And your story, little\r\nlady, confirms my idea. They know we\u2019re looking for Jane Finn. Well,\r\nthey\u2019ll produce a Jane Finn of their own--say at a _pensionnat_ in\r\nParis.\u201d Tuppence gasped, and Mr. Carter smiled. \u201cNo one knows in the\r\nleast what she looks like, so that\u2019s all right. She\u2019s primed with a\r\ntrumped-up tale, and her real business is to get as much information as\r\npossible out of us. See the idea?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you think\u201d--Tuppence paused to grasp the supposition fully--\u201cthat\r\nit _was_ as Jane Finn that they wanted me to go to Paris?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Carter smiled more wearily than ever.\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe in coincidences, you know,\u201d he said.\r\n\n\u201cWELL,\u201d said Tuppence, recovering herself, \u201cit really seems as though it\r\nwere meant to be.\u201d\r\n\r\nCarter nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know what you mean. I\u2019m superstitious myself. Luck, and all that sort\r\nof thing. Fate seems to have chosen you out to be mixed up in this.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy indulged in a chuckle.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy word! I don\u2019t wonder Whittington got the wind up when Tuppence\r\nplumped out that name! I should have myself. But look here, sir, we\u2019re\r\ntaking up an awful lot of your time. Have you any tips to give us before\r\nwe clear out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think not. My experts, working in stereotyped ways, have failed.\r\nYou will bring imagination and an open mind to the task. Don\u2019t be\r\ndiscouraged if that too does not succeed. For one thing there is a\r\nlikelihood of the pace being forced.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence frowned uncomprehendingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you had that interview with Whittington, they had time before\r\nthem. I have information that the big _coup_ was planned for early in\r\nthe new year. But the Government is contemplating legislative action\r\nwhich will deal effectually with the strike menace. They\u2019ll get wind of\r\nit soon, if they haven\u2019t already, and it\u2019s possible that that may bring\r\nthings to a head. I hope it will myself. The less time they have to\r\nmature their plans the better. I\u2019m just warning you that you haven\u2019t\r\nmuch time before you, and that you needn\u2019t be cast down if you fail.\r\nIt\u2019s not an easy proposition anyway. That\u2019s all.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think we ought to be businesslike. What exactly can we count upon you\r\nfor, Mr. Carter?\u201d Mr. Carter\u2019s lips twitched slightly, but he replied\r\nsuccinctly: \u201cFunds within reason, detailed information on any point,\r\nand _no official recognition_. I mean that if you get yourselves into\r\ntrouble with the police, I can\u2019t officially help you out of it. You\u2019re\r\non your own.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence nodded sagely.\r\n\r\n\u201cI quite understand that. I\u2019ll write out a list of the things I want to\r\nknow when I\u2019ve had time to think. Now--about money----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Miss Tuppence. Do you want to say how much?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot exactly. We\u2019ve got plenty to go with for the present, but when we\r\nwant more----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will be waiting for you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but--I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t want to be rude about the Government if\r\nyou\u2019ve got anything to do with it, but you know one really has the devil\r\nof a time getting anything out of it! And if we have to fill up a blue\r\nform and send it in, and then, after three months, they send us a green\r\none, and so on--well, that won\u2019t be much use, will it?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Carter laughed outright.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Miss Tuppence. You will send a personal demand to me here,\r\nand the money, in notes, shall be sent by return of post. As to salary,\r\nshall we say at the rate of three hundred a year? And an equal sum for\r\nMr. Beresford, of course.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence beamed upon him.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow lovely. You are kind. I do love money! I\u2019ll keep beautiful accounts\r\nof our expenses all debit and credit, and the balance on the right side,\r\nand red line drawn sideways with the totals the same at the bottom. I\r\nreally know how to do it when I think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you do. Well, good-bye, and good luck to you both.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe shook hands with them, and in another minute they were descending the\r\nsteps of 27 Carshalton Terrace with their heads in a whirl.\r\n\r\n\u201cTommy! Tell me at once, who is \u2018Mr. Carter\u2019?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy murmured a name in her ear.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Tuppence, impressed.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I can tell you, old bean, he\u2019s IT!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Tuppence again. Then she added reflectively,\r\n\r\n\u201cI like him, don\u2019t you? He looks so awfully tired and bored, and yet you\r\nfeel that underneath he\u2019s just like steel, all keen and flashing. Oh!\u201d\r\n She gave a skip. \u201cPinch me, Tommy, do pinch me. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s\r\nreal!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Beresford obliged.\r\n\r\n\u201cOw! That\u2019s enough! Yes, we\u2019re not dreaming. We\u2019ve got a job!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what a job! The joint venture has really begun.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s more respectable than I thought it would be,\u201d said Tuppence\r\nthoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cLuckily I haven\u2019t got your craving for crime! What time is it? Let\u2019s\r\nhave lunch--oh!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe same thought sprang to the minds of each. Tommy voiced it first.\r\n\r\n\u201cJulius P. Hersheimmer!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe never told Mr. Carter about hearing from him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there wasn\u2019t much to tell--not till we\u2019ve seen him. Come on, we\u2019d\r\nbetter take a taxi.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow who\u2019s being extravagant?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll expenses paid, remember. Hop in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt any rate, we shall make a better effect arriving this way,\u201d said\r\nTuppence, leaning back luxuriously. \u201cI\u2019m sure blackmailers never arrive\r\nin buses!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve ceased being blackmailers,\u201d Tommy pointed out.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I have,\u201d said Tuppence darkly.\r\n\r\nOn inquiring for Mr. Hersheimmer, they were at once taken up to his\r\nsuite. An impatient voice cried \u201cCome in\u201d in answer to the page-boy\u2019s\r\nknock, and the lad stood aside to let them pass in.\r\n\r\nMr. Julius P. Hersheimmer was a great deal younger than either Tommy or\r\nTuppence had pictured him. The girl put him down as thirty-five. He\r\nwas of middle height, and squarely built to match his jaw. His face was\r\npugnacious but pleasant. No one could have mistaken him for anything but\r\nan American, though he spoke with very little accent.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet my note? Sit down and tell me right away all you know about my\r\ncousin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour cousin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure thing. Jane Finn.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs she your cousin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy father and her mother were brother and sister,\u201d explained Mr.\r\nHersheimmer meticulously.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d cried Tuppence. \u201cThen you know where she is?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Mr. Hersheimmer brought down his fist with a bang on the table.\r\n\u201cI\u2019m darned if I do! Don\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe advertised to receive information, not to give it,\u201d said Tuppence\r\nseverely.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess I know that. I can read. But I thought maybe it was her back\r\nhistory you were after, and that you\u2019d know where she was now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we wouldn\u2019t mind hearing her back history,\u201d said Tuppence\r\nguardedly.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Hersheimmer seemed to grow suddenly suspicious.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee here,\u201d he declared. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Sicily! No demanding ransom or\r\nthreatening to crop her ears if I refuse. These are the British Isles,\r\nso quit the funny business, or I\u2019ll just sing out for that beautiful big\r\nBritish policeman I see out there in Piccadilly.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy hastened to explain.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t kidnapped your cousin. On the contrary, we\u2019re trying to find\r\nher. We\u2019re employed to do so.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Hersheimmer leant back in his chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cPut me wise,\u201d he said succinctly.\r\n\r\nTommy fell in with this demand in so far as he gave him a guarded\r\nversion of the disappearance of Jane Finn, and of the possibility of her\r\nhaving been mixed up unawares in \u201csome political show.\u201d He alluded to\r\nTuppence and himself as \u201cprivate inquiry agents\u201d commissioned to find\r\nher, and added that they would therefore be glad of any details Mr.\r\nHersheimmer could give them.\r\n\r\nThat gentleman nodded approval.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s all right. I was just a mite hasty. But London gets my\r\ngoat! I only know little old New York. Just trot out your questions and\r\nI\u2019ll answer.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor the moment this paralysed the Young Adventurers, but Tuppence,\r\nrecovering herself, plunged boldly into the breach with a reminiscence\r\nculled from detective fiction.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did you last see the dece--your cousin, I mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever seen her,\u201d responded Mr. Hersheimmer.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d demanded Tommy, astonished.\r\n\r\nHersheimmer turned to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir. As I said before, my father and her mother were brother and\r\nsister, just as you might be\u201d--Tommy did not correct this view of their\r\nrelationship--\u201cbut they didn\u2019t always get on together. And when my aunt\r\nmade up her mind to marry Amos Finn, who was a poor school teacher out\r\nWest, my father was just mad! Said if he made his pile, as he seemed\r\nin a fair way to do, she\u2019d never see a cent of it. Well, the upshot was\r\nthat Aunt Jane went out West and we never heard from her again.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe old man _did_ pile it up. He went into oil, and he went into steel,\r\nand he played a bit with railroads, and I can tell you he made Wall\r\nStreet sit up!\u201d He paused. \u201cThen he died--last fall--and I got the\r\ndollars. Well, would you believe it, my conscience got busy! Kept\r\nknocking me up and saying: What about your Aunt Jane, way out West? It\r\nworried me some. You see, I figured it out that Amos Finn would never\r\nmake good. He wasn\u2019t the sort. End of it was, I hired a man to hunt her\r\ndown. Result, she was dead, and Amos Finn was dead, but they\u2019d left a\r\ndaughter--Jane--who\u2019d been torpedoed in the _Lusitania_ on her way to\r\nParis. She was saved all right, but they didn\u2019t seem able to hear of her\r\nover this side. I guessed they weren\u2019t hustling any, so I thought I\u2019d\r\ncome along over, and speed things up. I phoned Scotland Yard and the\r\nAdmiralty first thing. The Admiralty rather choked me off, but Scotland\r\nYard were very civil--said they would make inquiries, even sent a man\r\nround this morning to get her photograph. I\u2019m off to Paris to-morrow,\r\njust to see what the Prefecture is doing. I guess if I go to and fro\r\nhustling them, they ought to get busy!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe energy of Mr. Hersheimmer was tremendous. They bowed before it.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut say now,\u201d he ended, \u201cyou\u2019re not after her for anything? Contempt of\r\ncourt, or something British? A proud-spirited young American girl might\r\nfind your rules and regulations in war time rather irksome, and get up\r\nagainst it. If that\u2019s the case, and there\u2019s such a thing as graft in\r\nthis country, I\u2019ll buy her off.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence reassured him.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. Then we can work together. What about some lunch? Shall we\r\nhave it up here, or go down to the restaurant?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence expressed a preference for the latter, and Julius bowed to her\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nOysters had just given place to Sole Colbert when a card was brought to\r\nHersheimmer.\r\n\r\n\u201cInspector Japp, C.I.D. Scotland Yard again. Another man this time. What\r\ndoes he expect I can tell him that I didn\u2019t tell the first chap? I hope\r\nthey haven\u2019t lost that photograph. That Western photographer\u2019s place was\r\nburned down and all his negatives destroyed--this is the only copy in\r\nexistence. I got it from the principal of the college there.\u201d\r\n\r\nAn unformulated dread swept over Tuppence.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou--you don\u2019t know the name of the man who came this morning?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I do. No, I don\u2019t. Half a second. It was on his card. Oh, I know!\r\nInspector Brown. Quiet, unassuming sort of chap.\u201d\r\n\nA veil might with profit be drawn over the events of the next half-hour.\r\nSuffice it to say that no such person as \u201cInspector Brown\u201d was known to\r\nScotland Yard. The photograph of Jane Finn, which would have been of\r\nthe utmost value to the police in tracing her, was lost beyond recovery.\r\nOnce again \u201cMr. Brown\u201d had triumphed.\r\n\r\nThe immediate result of this set-back was to effect a _rapprochement_\r\nbetween Julius Hersheimmer and the Young Adventurers. All barriers went\r\ndown with a crash, and Tommy and Tuppence felt they had known the young\r\nAmerican all their lives. They abandoned the discreet reticence of\r\n\u201cprivate inquiry agents,\u201d and revealed to him the whole history of\r\nthe joint venture, whereat the young man declared himself \u201ctickled to\r\ndeath.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe turned to Tuppence at the close of the narration.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had a kind of idea that English girls were just a mite\r\nmoss-grown. Old-fashioned and sweet, you know, but scared to move round\r\nwithout a footman or a maiden aunt. I guess I\u2019m a bit behind the times!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe upshot of these confidential relations was that Tommy and Tuppence\r\ntook up their abode forthwith at the _Ritz_, in order, as Tuppence put\r\nit, to keep in touch with Jane Finn\u2019s only living relation. \u201cAnd put\r\nlike that,\u201d she added confidentially to Tommy, \u201cnobody could boggle at\r\nthe expense!\u201d\r\n\r\nNobody did, which was the great thing.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d said the young lady on the morning after their installation,\r\n\u201cto work!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Beresford put down the _Daily Mail_, which he was reading, and\r\napplauded with somewhat unnecessary vigour. He was politely requested by\r\nhis colleague not to be an ass.\r\n\r\n\u201cDash it all, Tommy, we\u2019ve got to _do_ something for our money.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy sighed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I fear even the dear old Government will not support us at the\r\n_Ritz_ in idleness for ever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTherefore, as I said before, we must _do_ something.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Tommy, picking up the _Daily Mail_ again, \u201c_do_ it. I\r\nshan\u2019t stop you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d continued Tuppence. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking----\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was interrupted by a fresh bout of applause.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very well for you to sit there being funny, Tommy. It would do\r\nyou no harm to do a little brain work too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy union, Tuppence, my union! It does not permit me to work before 11\r\na.m.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTommy, do you want something thrown at you? It is absolutely essential\r\nthat we should without delay map out a plan of campaign.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHear, hear!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s do it.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy laid his paper finally aside. \u201cThere\u2019s something of the simplicity\r\nof the truly great mind about you, Tuppence. Fire ahead. I\u2019m listening.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo begin with,\u201d said Tuppence, \u201cwhat have we to go upon?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbsolutely nothing,\u201d said Tommy cheerily.\r\n\r\n\u201cWrong!\u201d Tuppence wagged an energetic finger. \u201cWe have two distinct\r\nclues.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFirst clue, we know one of the gang.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhittington?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I\u2019d recognize him anywhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHum,\u201d said Tommy doubtfully, \u201cI don\u2019t call that much of a clue. You\r\ndon\u2019t know where to look for him, and it\u2019s about a thousand to one\r\nagainst your running against him by accident.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that,\u201d replied Tuppence thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019ve often\r\nnoticed that once coincidences start happening they go on happening in\r\nthe most extraordinary way. I dare say it\u2019s some natural law that we\r\nhaven\u2019t found out. Still, as you say, we can\u2019t rely on that. But there\r\n_are_ places in London where simply every one is bound to turn up sooner\r\nor later. Piccadilly Circus, for instance. One of my ideas was to take\r\nup my stand there every day with a tray of flags.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about meals?\u201d inquired the practical Tommy.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow like a man! What does mere food matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all very well. You\u2019ve just had a thundering good breakfast. No\r\none\u2019s got a better appetite than you have, Tuppence, and by tea-time\r\nyou\u2019d be eating the flags, pins and all. But, honestly, I don\u2019t think\r\nmuch of the idea. Whittington mayn\u2019t be in London at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true. Anyway, I think clue No. 2 is more promising.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s hear it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. Only a Christian name--Rita. Whittington mentioned\r\nit that day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you proposing a third advertisement: Wanted, female crook,\r\nanswering to the name of Rita?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am not. I propose to reason in a logical manner. That man, Danvers,\r\nwas shadowed on the way over, wasn\u2019t he? And it\u2019s more likely to have\r\nbeen a woman than a man----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am absolutely certain that it would be a woman, and a good-looking\r\none,\u201d replied Tuppence calmly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn these technical points I bow to your decision,\u201d murmured Mr.\r\nBeresford.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, obviously this woman, whoever she was, was saved.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you make that out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf she wasn\u2019t, how would they have known Jane Finn had got the papers?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCorrect. Proceed, O Sherlock!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow there\u2019s just a chance, I admit it\u2019s only a chance, that this woman\r\nmay have been \u2018Rita.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd if so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf so, we\u2019ve got to hunt through the survivors of the _Lusitania_ till\r\nwe find her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen the first thing is to get a list of the survivors.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it. I wrote a long list of things I wanted to know, and sent\r\nit to Mr. Carter. I got his reply this morning, and among other things\r\nit encloses the official statement of those saved from the _Lusitania_.\r\nHow\u2019s that for clever little Tuppence?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFull marks for industry, zero for modesty. But the great point is, is\r\nthere a \u2018Rita\u2019 on the list?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just what I don\u2019t know,\u201d confessed Tuppence.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Look here.\u201d Together they bent over the list. \u201cYou see, very few\r\nChristian names are given. They\u2019re nearly all Mrs. or Miss.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat complicates matters,\u201d he murmured thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nTuppence gave her characteristic \u201cterrier\u201d shake.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ve just got to get down to it, that\u2019s all. We\u2019ll start with\r\nthe London area. Just note down the addresses of any of the females who\r\nlive in London or roundabout, while I put on my hat.\u201d\r\n\r\nFive minutes later the young couple emerged into Piccadilly, and a few\r\nseconds later a taxi was bearing them to The Laurels, Glendower Road,\r\nN.7, the residence of Mrs. Edgar Keith, whose name figured first in a\r\nlist of seven reposing in Tommy\u2019s pocket-book.\r\n\r\nThe Laurels was a dilapidated house, standing back from the road with\r\na few grimy bushes to support the fiction of a front garden. Tommy paid\r\noff the taxi, and accompanied Tuppence to the front door bell. As she\r\nwas about to ring it, he arrested her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat am I going to say? Why, I shall say--Oh dear, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s\r\nvery awkward.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought as much,\u201d said Tommy with satisfaction. \u201cHow like a woman! No\r\nforesight! Now just stand aside, and see how easily the mere male\r\ndeals with the situation.\u201d He pressed the bell. Tuppence withdrew to a\r\nsuitable spot.\r\n\r\nA slatternly looking servant, with an extremely dirty face and a pair of\r\neyes that did not match, answered the door.\r\n\r\nTommy had produced a notebook and pencil.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said briskly and cheerfully. \u201cFrom the Hampstead\r\nBorough Council. The new Voting Register. Mrs. Edgar Keith lives here,\r\ndoes she not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYaas,\u201d said the servant.\r\n\r\n\u201cChristian name?\u201d asked Tommy, his pencil poised.\r\n\r\n\u201cMissus\u2019s? Eleanor Jane.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEleanor,\u201d spelt Tommy. \u201cAny sons or daughters over twenty-one?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNaow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Tommy closed the notebook with a brisk snap. \u201cGood\r\nmorning.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe servant volunteered her first remark:\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought perhaps as you\u2019d come about the gas,\u201d she observed\r\ncryptically, and shut the door.\r\n\r\nTommy rejoined his accomplice.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see, Tuppence,\u201d he observed. \u201cChild\u2019s play to the masculine mind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind admitting that for once you\u2019ve scored handsomely. I should\r\nnever have thought of that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood wheeze, wasn\u2019t it? And we can repeat it _ad lib_.\u201d\r\n\r\nLunch-time found the young couple attacking a steak and chips in an\r\nobscure hostelry with avidity. They had collected a Gladys Mary and a\r\nMarjorie, been baffled by one change of address, and had been forced to\r\nlisten to a long lecture on universal suffrage from a vivacious American\r\nlady whose Christian name had proved to be Sadie.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Tommy, imbibing a long draught of beer, \u201cI feel better.\r\nWhere\u2019s the next draw?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe notebook lay on the table between them. Tuppence picked it up.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Vandemeyer,\u201d she read, \u201c20 South Audley Mansions. Miss Wheeler, 43\r\nClapington Road, Battersea. She\u2019s a lady\u2019s maid, as far as I remember,\r\nso probably won\u2019t be there, and, anyway, she\u2019s not likely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen the Mayfair lady is clearly indicated as the first port of call.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTommy, I\u2019m getting discouraged.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBuck up, old bean. We always knew it was an outside chance. And,\r\nanyway, we\u2019re only starting. If we draw a blank in London, there\u2019s a\r\nfine tour of England, Ireland and Scotland before us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue,\u201d said Tuppence, her flagging spirits reviving. \u201cAnd all expenses\r\npaid! But, oh, Tommy, I do like things to happen quickly. So far,\r\nadventure has succeeded adventure, but this morning has been dull as\r\ndull.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must stifle this longing for vulgar sensation, Tuppence. Remember\r\nthat if Mr. Brown is all he is reported to be, it\u2019s a wonder that he has\r\nnot ere now done us to death. That\u2019s a good sentence, quite a literary\r\nflavour about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re really more conceited than I am--with less excuse! Ahem! But it\r\ncertainly is queer that Mr. Brown has not yet wreaked vengeance upon us.\r\n(You see, I can do it too.) We pass on our way unscathed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps he doesn\u2019t think us worth bothering about,\u201d suggested the young\r\nman simply.\r\n\r\nTuppence received the remark with great disfavour.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow horrid you are, Tommy. Just as though we didn\u2019t count.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSorry, Tuppence. What I meant was that we work like moles in the dark,\r\nand that he has no suspicion of our nefarious schemes. Ha ha!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHa ha!\u201d echoed Tuppence approvingly, as she rose.\r\n\r\nSouth Audley Mansions was an imposing-looking block of flats just off\r\nPark Lane. No. 20 was on the second floor.\r\n\r\nTommy had by this time the glibness born of practice. He rattled off\r\nthe formula to the elderly woman, looking more like a housekeeper than a\r\nservant, who opened the door to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cChristian name?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMargaret.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy spelt it, but the other interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, _g u e_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Marguerite; French way, I see.\u201d He paused, then plunged boldly. \u201cWe\r\nhad her down as Rita Vandemeyer, but I suppose that\u2019s incorrect?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s mostly called that, sir, but Marguerite\u2019s her name.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you. That\u2019s all. Good morning.\u201d\r\n\r\nHardly able to contain his excitement, Tommy hurried down the stairs.\r\nTuppence was waiting at the angle of the turn.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou heard?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Oh, _Tommy!_\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy squeezed her arm sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know, old thing. I feel the same.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s--it\u2019s so lovely to think of things--and then for them really to\r\nhappen!\u201d cried Tuppence enthusiastically.\r\n\r\nHer hand was still in Tommy\u2019s. They had reached the entrance hall. There\r\nwere footsteps on the stairs above them, and voices.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, to Tommy\u2019s complete surprise, Tuppence dragged him into the\r\nlittle space by the side of the lift where the shadow was deepest.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHush!\u201d\r\n\r\nTwo men came down the stairs and passed out through the entrance.\r\nTuppence\u2019s hand closed tighter on Tommy\u2019s arm.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuick--follow them. I daren\u2019t. He might recognize me. I don\u2019t know who\r\nthe other man is, but the bigger of the two was Whittington.\u201d\r\n\nWHITTINGTON and his companion were walking at a good pace. Tommy started\r\nin pursuit at once, and was in time to see them turn the corner of the\r\nstreet. His vigorous strides soon enabled him to gain upon them, and by\r\nthe time he, in his turn, reached the corner the distance between them\r\nwas sensibly lessened. The small Mayfair streets were comparatively\r\ndeserted, and he judged it wise to content himself with keeping them in\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nThe sport was a new one to him. Though familiar with the technicalities\r\nfrom a course of novel reading, he had never before attempted to\r\n\u201cfollow\u201d anyone, and it appeared to him at once that, in actual\r\npractice, the proceeding was fraught with difficulties. Supposing, for\r\ninstance, that they should suddenly hail a taxi? In books, you simply\r\nleapt into another, promised the driver a sovereign--or its modern\r\nequivalent--and there you were. In actual fact, Tommy foresaw that it\r\nwas extremely likely there would be no second taxi. Therefore he\r\nwould have to run. What happened in actual fact to a young man who ran\r\nincessantly and persistently through the London streets? In a main road\r\nhe might hope to create the illusion that he was merely running for a\r\nbus. But in these obscure aristocratic byways he could not but feel that\r\nan officious policeman might stop him to explain matters.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture in his thoughts a taxi with flag erect turned the\r\ncorner of the street ahead. Tommy held his breath. Would they hail it?\r\n\r\nHe drew a sigh of relief as they allowed it to pass unchallenged. Their\r\ncourse was a zigzag one designed to bring them as quickly as possible\r\nto Oxford Street. When at length they turned into it, proceeding in an\r\neasterly direction, Tommy slightly increased his pace. Little by little\r\nhe gained upon them. On the crowded pavement there was little chance of\r\nhis attracting their notice, and he was anxious if possible to catch\r\na word or two of their conversation. In this he was completely\r\nfoiled; they spoke low and the din of the traffic drowned their voices\r\neffectually.\r\n\r\nJust before the Bond Street Tube station they crossed the road, Tommy,\r\nunperceived, faithfully at their heels, and entered the big Lyons\u2019.\r\nThere they went up to the first floor, and sat at a small table in the\r\nwindow. It was late, and the place was thinning out. Tommy took a seat\r\nat the table next to them, sitting directly behind Whittington in case\r\nof recognition. On the other hand, he had a full view of the second man\r\nand studied him attentively. He was fair, with a weak, unpleasant face,\r\nand Tommy put him down as being either a Russian or a Pole. He was\r\nprobably about fifty years of age, his shoulders cringed a little as he\r\ntalked, and his eyes, small and crafty, shifted unceasingly.\r\n\r\nHaving already lunched heartily, Tommy contented himself with ordering\r\na Welsh rarebit and a cup of coffee. Whittington ordered a substantial\r\nlunch for himself and his companion; then, as the waitress withdrew, he\r\nmoved his chair a little closer to the table and began to talk earnestly\r\nin a low voice. The other man joined in. Listen as he would, Tommy could\r\nonly catch a word here and there; but the gist of it seemed to be some\r\ndirections or orders which the big man was impressing on his companion,\r\nand with which the latter seemed from time to time to disagree.\r\nWhittington addressed the other as Boris.\r\n\r\nTommy caught the word \u201cIreland\u201d several times, also \u201cpropaganda,\u201d but\r\nof Jane Finn there was no mention. Suddenly, in a lull in the clatter of\r\nthe room, he got one phrase entire. Whittington was speaking. \u201cAh, but\r\nyou don\u2019t know Flossie. She\u2019s a marvel. An archbishop would swear she\r\nwas his own mother. She gets the voice right every time, and that\u2019s\r\nreally the principal thing.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy did not hear Boris\u2019s reply, but in response to it Whittington said\r\nsomething that sounded like: \u201cOf course--only in an emergency....\u201d\r\n\r\nThen he lost the thread again. But presently the phrases became distinct\r\nagain whether because the other two had insensibly raised their voices,\r\nor because Tommy\u2019s ears were getting more attuned, he could not tell.\r\nBut two words certainly had a most stimulating effect upon the listener.\r\nThey were uttered by Boris and they were: \u201cMr. Brown.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhittington seemed to remonstrate with him, but he merely laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not, my friend? It is a name most respectable--most common. Did\r\nhe not choose it for that reason? Ah, I should like to meet him--Mr.\r\nBrown.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a steely ring in Whittington\u2019s voice as he replied:\r\n\r\n\u201cWho knows? You may have met him already.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBah!\u201d retorted the other. \u201cThat is children\u2019s talk--a fable for the\r\npolice. Do you know what I say to myself sometimes? That he is a fable\r\ninvented by the Inner Ring, a bogy to frighten us with. It might be so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd it might not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder ... or is it indeed true that he is with us and amongst us,\r\nunknown to all but a chosen few? If so, he keeps his secret well. And\r\nthe idea is a good one, yes. We never know. We look at each other--\r\n_one of us is Mr. Brown_--which? He commands--but also he serves. Among\r\nus--in the midst of us. And no one knows which he is....\u201d\r\n\r\nWith an effort the Russian shook off the vagary of his fancy. He looked\r\nat his watch.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Whittington. \u201cWe might as well go.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe called the waitress and asked for his bill. Tommy did likewise, and a\r\nfew moments later was following the two men down the stairs.\r\n\r\nOutside, Whittington hailed a taxi, and directed the driver to go to\r\nWaterloo.\r\n\r\nTaxis were plentiful here, and before Whittington\u2019s had driven off\r\nanother was drawing up to the curb in obedience to Tommy\u2019s peremptory\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\u201cFollow that other taxi,\u201d directed the young man. \u201cDon\u2019t lose it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe elderly chauffeur showed no interest. He merely grunted and jerked\r\ndown his flag. The drive was uneventful. Tommy\u2019s taxi came to rest at\r\nthe departure platform just after Whittington\u2019s. Tommy was behind him at\r\nthe booking-office. He took a first-class single ticket to Bournemouth,\r\nTommy did the same. As he emerged, Boris remarked, glancing up at the\r\nclock: \u201cYou are early. You have nearly half an hour.\u201d\r\n\r\nBoris\u2019s words had aroused a new train of thought in Tommy\u2019s mind.\r\nClearly Whittington was making the journey alone, while the other\r\nremained in London. Therefore he was left with a choice as to which he\r\nwould follow. Obviously, he could not follow both of them unless----\r\nLike Boris, he glanced up at the clock, and then to the announcement\r\nboard of the trains. The Bournemouth train left at 3.30. It was now ten\r\npast. Whittington and Boris were walking up and down by the bookstall.\r\nHe gave one doubtful look at them, then hurried into an adjacent\r\ntelephone box. He dared not waste time in trying to get hold of\r\nTuppence. In all probability she was still in the neighbourhood of South\r\nAudley Mansions. But there remained another ally. He rang up the _Ritz_\r\nand asked for Julius Hersheimmer. There was a click and a buzz. Oh, if\r\nonly the young American was in his room! There was another click, and\r\nthen \u201cHello\u201d in unmistakable accents came over the wire.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat you, Hersheimmer? Beresford speaking. I\u2019m at Waterloo. I\u2019ve\r\nfollowed Whittington and another man here. No time to explain.\r\nWhittington\u2019s off to Bournemouth by the 3.30. Can you get there by\r\nthen?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe reply was reassuring.\r\n\r\n\u201cSure. I\u2019ll hustle.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe telephone rang off. Tommy put back the receiver with a sigh of\r\nrelief. His opinion of Julius\u2019s power of hustling was high. He felt\r\ninstinctively that the American would arrive in time.\r\n\r\nWhittington and Boris were still where he had left them. If Boris\r\nremained to see his friend off, all was well. Then Tommy fingered his\r\npocket thoughtfully. In spite of the carte blanche assured to him, he\r\nhad not yet acquired the habit of going about with any considerable sum\r\nof money on him. The taking of the first-class ticket to Bournemouth\r\nhad left him with only a few shillings in his pocket. It was to be hoped\r\nthat Julius would arrive better provided.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the minutes were creeping by: 3.15, 3.20, 3.25, 3.27.\r\nSupposing Julius did not get there in time. 3.29.... Doors were banging.\r\nTommy felt cold waves of despair pass over him. Then a hand fell on his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere I am, son. Your British traffic beats description! Put me wise to\r\nthe crooks right away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Whittington--there, getting in now, that big dark man. The other\r\nis the foreign chap he\u2019s talking to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m on to them. Which of the two is my bird?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy had thought out this question.\r\n\r\n\u201cGot any money with you?\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius shook his head, and Tommy\u2019s face fell.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess I haven\u2019t more than three or four hundred dollars with me at\r\nthe moment,\u201d explained the American.\r\n\r\nTommy gave a faint whoop of relief.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Lord, you millionaires! You don\u2019t talk the same language! Climb\r\naboard the lugger. Here\u2019s your ticket. Whittington\u2019s your man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMe for Whittington!\u201d said Julius darkly. The train was just starting\r\nas he swung himself aboard. \u201cSo long, Tommy.\u201d The train slid out of the\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nTommy drew a deep breath. The man Boris was coming along the platform\r\ntowards him. Tommy allowed him to pass and then took up the chase once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nFrom Waterloo Boris took the tube as far as Piccadilly Circus. Then he\r\nwalked up Shaftesbury Avenue, finally turning off into the maze of mean\r\nstreets round Soho. Tommy followed him at a judicious distance.\r\n\r\nThey reached at length a small dilapidated square. The houses there had\r\na sinister air in the midst of their dirt and decay. Boris looked round,\r\nand Tommy drew back into the shelter of a friendly porch. The place was\r\nalmost deserted. It was a cul-de-sac, and consequently no traffic passed\r\nthat way. The stealthy way the other had looked round stimulated Tommy\u2019s\r\nimagination. From the shelter of the doorway he watched him go up the\r\nsteps of a particularly evil-looking house and rap sharply, with a\r\npeculiar rhythm, on the door. It was opened promptly, he said a word or\r\ntwo to the doorkeeper, then passed inside. The door was shut to again.\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that Tommy lost his head. What he ought to have\r\ndone, what any sane man would have done, was to remain patiently where\r\nhe was and wait for his man to come out again. What he did do was\r\nentirely foreign to the sober common sense which was, as a rule, his\r\nleading characteristic. Something, as he expressed it, seemed to snap in\r\nhis brain. Without a moment\u2019s pause for reflection he, too, went up the\r\nsteps, and reproduced as far as he was able the peculiar knock.\r\n\r\nThe door swung open with the same promptness as before. A\r\nvillainous-faced man with close-cropped hair stood in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d he grunted.\r\n\r\nIt was at that moment that the full realization of his folly began to\r\ncome home to Tommy. But he dared not hesitate. He seized at the first\r\nwords that came into his mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Brown?\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise the man stood aside.\r\n\r\n\u201cUpstairs,\u201d he said, jerking his thumb over his shoulder, \u201csecond door\r\non your left.\u201d\r\n\nTAKEN aback though he was by the man\u2019s words, Tommy did not hesitate.\r\nIf audacity had successfully carried him so far, it was to be hoped\r\nit would carry him yet farther. He quietly passed into the house and\r\nmounted the ramshackle staircase. Everything in the house was filthy\r\nbeyond words. The grimy paper, of a pattern now indistinguishable,\r\nhung in loose festoons from the wall. In every angle was a grey mass of\r\ncobweb.\r\n\r\nTommy proceeded leisurely. By the time he reached the bend of the\r\nstaircase, he had heard the man below disappear into a back room.\r\nClearly no suspicion attached to him as yet. To come to the house and\r\nask for \u201cMr. Brown\u201d appeared indeed to be a reasonable and natural\r\nproceeding.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the stairs Tommy halted to consider his next move. In\r\nfront of him ran a narrow passage, with doors opening on either side of\r\nit. From the one nearest him on the left came a low murmur of voices.\r\nIt was this room which he had been directed to enter. But what held\r\nhis glance fascinated was a small recess immediately on his right,\r\nhalf concealed by a torn velvet curtain. It was directly opposite the\r\nleft-handed door and, owing to its angle, it also commanded a good view\r\nof the upper part of the staircase. As a hiding-place for one or, at a\r\npinch, two men, it was ideal, being about two feet deep and three feet\r\nwide. It attracted Tommy mightily. He thought things over in his usual\r\nslow and steady way, deciding that the mention of \u201cMr. Brown\u201d was not a\r\nrequest for an individual, but in all probability a password used by\r\nthe gang. His lucky use of it had gained him admission. So far he had\r\naroused no suspicion. But he must decide quickly on his next step.\r\n\r\nSuppose he were boldly to enter the room on the left of the passage.\r\nWould the mere fact of his having been admitted to the house be\r\nsufficient? Perhaps a further password would be required, or, at any\r\nrate, some proof of identity. The doorkeeper clearly did not know all\r\nthe members of the gang by sight, but it might be different upstairs.\r\nOn the whole it seemed to him that luck had served him very well so far,\r\nbut that there was such a thing as trusting it too far. To enter\r\nthat room was a colossal risk. He could not hope to sustain his part\r\nindefinitely; sooner or later he was almost bound to betray himself, and\r\nthen he would have thrown away a vital chance in mere foolhardiness.\r\n\r\nA repetition of the signal knock sounded on the door below, and Tommy,\r\nhis mind made up, slipped quickly into the recess, and cautiously drew\r\nthe curtain farther across so that it shielded him completely from\r\nsight. There were several rents and slits in the ancient material which\r\nafforded him a good view. He would watch events, and any time he chose\r\ncould, after all, join the assembly, modelling his behaviour on that of\r\nthe new arrival.\r\n\r\nThe man who came up the staircase with a furtive, soft-footed tread was\r\nquite unknown to Tommy. He was obviously of the very dregs of society.\r\nThe low beetling brows, and the criminal jaw, the bestiality of the\r\nwhole countenance were new to the young man, though he was a type that\r\nScotland Yard would have recognized at a glance.\r\n\r\nThe man passed the recess, breathing heavily as he went. He stopped at\r\nthe door opposite, and gave a repetition of the signal knock. A voice\r\ninside called out something, and the man opened the door and passed in,\r\naffording Tommy a momentary glimpse of the room inside. He thought there\r\nmust be about four or five people seated round a long table that took up\r\nmost of the space, but his attention was caught and held by a tall man\r\nwith close-cropped hair and a short, pointed, naval-looking beard,\r\nwho sat at the head of the table with papers in front of him. As the\r\nnew-comer entered he glanced up, and with a correct, but curiously\r\nprecise enunciation, which attracted Tommy\u2019s notice, he asked:\r\n\r\n\u201cYour number, comrade?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFourteen, gov\u2019nor,\u201d replied the other hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe door shut again.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf that isn\u2019t a Hun, I\u2019m a Dutchman!\u201d said Tommy to himself. \u201cAnd\r\nrunning the show darned systematically too--as they always do. Lucky I\r\ndidn\u2019t roll in. I\u2019d have given the wrong number, and there would have\r\nbeen the deuce to pay. No, this is the place for me. Hullo, here\u2019s\r\nanother knock.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis visitor proved to be of an entirely different type to the last.\r\nTommy recognized in him an Irish Sinn Feiner. Certainly Mr. Brown\u2019s\r\norganization was a far-reaching concern. The common criminal, the\r\nwell-bred Irish gentleman, the pale Russian, and the efficient German\r\nmaster of the ceremonies! Truly a strange and sinister gathering! Who\r\nwas this man who held in his finger these curiously variegated links of\r\nan unknown chain?\r\n\r\nIn this case, the procedure was exactly the same. The signal knock, the\r\ndemand for a number, and the reply \u201cCorrect.\u201d\r\n\r\nTwo knocks followed in quick succession on the door below. The first man\r\nwas quite unknown to Tommy, who put him down as a city clerk. A quiet,\r\nintelligent-looking man, rather shabbily dressed. The second was of the\r\nworking classes, and his face was vaguely familiar to the young man.\r\n\r\nThree minutes later came another, a man of commanding appearance,\r\nexquisitely dressed, and evidently well born. His face, again, was not\r\nunknown to the watcher, though he could not for the moment put a name to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAfter his arrival there was a long wait. In fact Tommy concluded that\r\nthe gathering was now complete, and was just cautiously creeping out\r\nfrom his hiding-place, when another knock sent him scuttling back to\r\ncover.\r\n\r\nThis last-comer came up the stairs so quietly that he was almost abreast\r\nof Tommy before the young man had realized his presence.\r\n\r\nHe was a small man, very pale, with a gentle almost womanish air. The\r\nangle of the cheek-bones hinted at his Slavonic ancestry, otherwise\r\nthere was nothing to indicate his nationality. As he passed the recess,\r\nhe turned his head slowly. The strange light eyes seemed to burn through\r\nthe curtain; Tommy could hardly believe that the man did not know he was\r\nthere and in spite of himself he shivered. He was no more fanciful than\r\nthe majority of young Englishmen, but he could not rid himself of the\r\nimpression that some unusually potent force emanated from the man. The\r\ncreature reminded him of a venomous snake.\r\n\r\nA moment later his impression was proved correct. The new-comer knocked\r\non the door as all had done, but his reception was very different. The\r\nbearded man rose to his feet, and all the others followed suit. The\r\nGerman came forward and shook hands. His heels clicked together.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are honoured,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are greatly honoured. I much feared that\r\nit would be impossible.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe other answered in a low voice that had a kind of hiss in it:\r\n\r\n\u201cThere were difficulties. It will not be possible again, I fear. But one\r\nmeeting is essential--to define my policy. I can do nothing without--Mr.\r\nBrown. He is here?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe change in the German\u2019s voice was audible as he replied with slight\r\nhesitation:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have received a message. It is impossible for him to be present\r\nin person.\u201d He stopped, giving a curious impression of having left the\r\nsentence unfinished.\r\n\r\nA very slow smile overspread the face of the other. He looked round at a\r\ncircle of uneasy faces.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! I understand. I have read of his methods. He works in the dark and\r\ntrusts no one. But, all the same, it is possible that he is among us\r\nnow....\u201d He looked round him again, and again that expression of fear\r\nswept over the group. Each man seemed eyeing his neighbour doubtfully.\r\n\r\nThe Russian tapped his cheek.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo be it. Let us proceed.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe German seemed to pull himself together. He indicated the place he\r\nhad been occupying at the head of the table. The Russian demurred, but\r\nthe other insisted.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is the only possible place,\u201d he said, \u201cfor--Number One. Perhaps\r\nNumber Fourteen will shut the door?\u201d\r\n\r\nIn another moment Tommy was once more confronting bare wooden panels,\r\nand the voices within had sunk once more to a mere undistinguishable\r\nmurmur. Tommy became restive. The conversation he had overheard had\r\nstimulated his curiosity. He felt that, by hook or by crook, he must\r\nhear more.\r\n\r\nThere was no sound from below, and it did not seem likely that the\r\ndoorkeeper would come upstairs. After listening intently for a minute or\r\ntwo, he put his head round the curtain. The passage was deserted. Tommy\r\nbent down and removed his shoes, then, leaving them behind the curtain,\r\nhe walked gingerly out on his stockinged feet, and kneeling down by\r\nthe closed door he laid his ear cautiously to the crack. To his intense\r\nannoyance he could distinguish little more; just a chance word here and\r\nthere if a voice was raised, which merely served to whet his curiosity\r\nstill farther.\r\n\r\nHe eyed the handle of the door tentatively. Could he turn it by degrees\r\nso gently and imperceptibly that those in the room would notice nothing?\r\nHe decided that with great care it could be done. Very slowly, a\r\nfraction of an inch at a time, he moved it round, holding his breath in\r\nhis excessive care. A little more--a little more still--would it never\r\nbe finished? Ah! at last it would turn no farther.\r\n\r\nHe stayed so for a minute or two, then drew a deep breath, and pressed\r\nit ever so slightly inward. The door did not budge. Tommy was annoyed.\r\nIf he had to use too much force, it would almost certainly creak.\r\nHe waited until the voices rose a little, then he tried again. Still\r\nnothing happened. He increased the pressure. Had the beastly thing\r\nstuck? Finally, in desperation, he pushed with all his might. But the\r\ndoor remained firm, and at last the truth dawned upon him. It was locked\r\nor bolted on the inside.\r\n\r\nFor a moment or two Tommy\u2019s indignation got the better of him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m damned!\u201d he said. \u201cWhat a dirty trick!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs his indignation cooled, he prepared to face the situation. Clearly\r\nthe first thing to be done was to restore the handle to its original\r\nposition. If he let it go suddenly, the men inside would be almost\r\ncertain to notice it, so, with the same infinite pains, he reversed his\r\nformer tactics. All went well, and with a sigh of relief the young man\r\nrose to his feet. There was a certain bulldog tenacity about Tommy that\r\nmade him slow to admit defeat. Checkmated for the moment, he was far\r\nfrom abandoning the conflict. He still intended to hear what was going\r\non in the locked room. As one plan had failed, he must hunt about for\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nHe looked round him. A little farther along the passage on the left was\r\na second door. He slipped silently along to it. He listened for a moment\r\nor two, then tried the handle. It yielded, and he slipped inside.\r\n\r\nThe room, which was untenanted, was furnished as a bedroom. Like\r\neverything else in the house, the furniture was falling to pieces, and\r\nthe dirt was, if anything, more abundant.\r\n\r\nBut what interested Tommy was the thing he had hoped to find, a\r\ncommunicating door between the two rooms, up on the left by the window.\r\nCarefully closing the door into the passage behind him, he stepped\r\nacross to the other and examined it closely. The bolt was shot across\r\nit. It was very rusty, and had clearly not been used for some time. By\r\ngently wriggling it to and fro, Tommy managed to draw it back without\r\nmaking too much noise. Then he repeated his former man\u0153uvres with the\r\nhandle--this time with complete success. The door swung open--a crack,\r\na mere fraction, but enough for Tommy to hear what went on. There was a\r\nvelvet _porti\u00e8re_ on the inside of this door which prevented him from\r\nseeing, but he was able to recognize the voices with a reasonable amount\r\nof accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe Sinn Feiner was speaking. His rich Irish voice was unmistakable:\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all very well. But more money is essential. No money--no\r\nresults!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother voice which Tommy rather thought was that of Boris replied:\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you guarantee that there _are_ results?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn a month from now--sooner or later as you wish--I will guarantee you\r\nsuch a reign of terror in Ireland as shall shake the British Empire to\r\nits foundations.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, and then came the soft, sibilant accents of Number\r\nOne:\r\n\r\n\u201cGood! You shall have the money. Boris, you will see to that.\u201d\r\n\r\nBoris asked a question:\r\n\r\n\u201cVia the Irish Americans, and Mr. Potter as usual?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess that\u2019ll be all right!\u201d said a new voice, with a transatlantic\r\nintonation, \u201cthough I\u2019d like to point out, here and now, that things\r\nare getting a mite difficult. There\u2019s not the sympathy there was, and\r\na growing disposition to let the Irish settle their own affairs without\r\ninterference from America.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy felt that Boris had shrugged his shoulders as he answered:\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes that matter, since the money only nominally comes from the\r\nStates?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe chief difficulty is the landing of the ammunition,\u201d said the Sinn\r\nFeiner. \u201cThe money is conveyed in easily enough--thanks to our colleague\r\nhere.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother voice, which Tommy fancied was that of the tall,\r\ncommanding-looking man whose face had seemed familiar to him, said:\r\n\r\n\u201cThink of the feelings of Belfast if they could hear you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is settled, then,\u201d said the sibilant tones. \u201cNow, in the matter\r\nof the loan to an English newspaper, you have arranged the details\r\nsatisfactorily, Boris?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is good. An official denial from Moscow will be forthcoming if\r\nnecessary.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, and then the clear voice of the German broke the\r\nsilence:\r\n\r\n\u201cI am directed by--Mr. Brown, to place the summaries of the reports\r\nfrom the different unions before you. That of the miners is most\r\nsatisfactory. We must hold back the railways. There may be trouble with\r\nthe A.S.E.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a long time there was a silence, broken only by the rustle of papers\r\nand an occasional word of explanation from the German. Then Tommy heard\r\nthe light tap-tap of fingers, drumming on the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd--the date, my friend?\u201d said Number One.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe 29th.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Russian seemed to consider:\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is rather soon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know. But it was settled by the principal Labour leaders, and we\r\ncannot seem to interfere too much. They must believe it to be entirely\r\ntheir own show.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Russian laughed softly, as though amused.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is true. They must have no inkling that we\r\nare using them for our own ends. They are honest men--and that is their\r\nvalue to us. It is curious--but you cannot make a revolution without\r\nhonest men. The instinct of the populace is infallible.\u201d He paused, and\r\nthen repeated, as though the phrase pleased him: \u201cEvery revolution has\r\nhad its honest men. They are soon disposed of afterwards.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a sinister note in his voice.\r\n\r\nThe German resumed:\r\n\r\n\u201cClymes must go. He is too far-seeing. Number Fourteen will see to\r\nthat.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a hoarse murmur.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right, gov\u2019nor.\u201d And then after a moment or two: \u201cSuppose\r\nI\u2019m nabbed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will have the best legal talent to defend you,\u201d replied the\r\nGerman quietly. \u201cBut in any case you will wear gloves fitted with the\r\nfinger-prints of a notorious housebreaker. You have little to fear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I ain\u2019t afraid, gov\u2019nor. All for the good of the cause. The streets\r\nis going to run with blood, so they say.\u201d He spoke with a grim relish.\r\n\u201cDreams of it, sometimes, I does. And diamonds and pearls rolling about\r\nin the gutter for anyone to pick up!\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy heard a chair shifted. Then Number One spoke:\r\n\r\n\u201cThen all is arranged. We are assured of success?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI--think so.\u201d But the German spoke with less than his usual confidence.\r\n\r\nNumber One\u2019s voice held suddenly a dangerous quality:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat has gone wrong?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing; but----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Labour leaders. Without them, as you say, we can do nothing. If\r\nthey do not declare a general strike on the 29th----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy should they not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs you\u2019ve said, they\u2019re honest. And, in spite of everything we\u2019ve\r\ndone to discredit the Government in their eyes, I\u2019m not sure that they\r\nhaven\u2019t got a sneaking faith and belief in it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know. They abuse it unceasingly. But, on the whole, public opinion\r\nswings to the side of the Government. They will not go against it.\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain the Russian\u2019s fingers drummed on the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the point, my friend. I was given to understand that there was a\r\ncertain document in existence which assured success.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is so. If that document were placed before the leaders, the result\r\nwould be immediate. They would publish it broadcast throughout England,\r\nand declare for the revolution without a moment\u2019s hesitation. The\r\nGovernment would be broken finally and completely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen what more do you want?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe document itself,\u201d said the German bluntly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! It is not in your possession? But you know where it is?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes anyone know where it is?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne person--perhaps. And we are not sure of that even.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho is this person?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA girl.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy held his breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cA girl?\u201d The Russian\u2019s voice rose contemptuously. \u201cAnd you have not\r\nmade her speak? In Russia we have ways of making a girl talk.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis case is different,\u201d said the German sullenly.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow--different?\u201d He paused a moment, then went on: \u201cWhere is the girl\r\nnow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe girl?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is----\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Tommy heard no more. A crashing blow descended on his head, and all\r\nwas darkness.\r\n\nWHEN Tommy set forth on the trail of the two men, it took all Tuppence\u2019s\r\nself-command to refrain from accompanying him. However, she contained\r\nherself as best she might, consoled by the reflection that her reasoning\r\nhad been justified by events. The two men had undoubtedly come from the\r\nsecond floor flat, and that one slender thread of the name \u201cRita\u201d had\r\nset the Young Adventurers once more upon the track of the abductors of\r\nJane Finn.\r\n\r\nThe question was what to do next? Tuppence hated letting the grass grow\r\nunder her feet. Tommy was amply employed, and debarred from joining him\r\nin the chase, the girl felt at a loose end. She retraced her steps\r\nto the entrance hall of the mansions. It was now tenanted by a small\r\nlift-boy, who was polishing brass fittings, and whistling the latest air\r\nwith a good deal of vigour and a reasonable amount of accuracy.\r\n\r\nHe glanced round at Tuppence\u2019s entry. There was a certain amount of the\r\ngamin element in the girl, at all events she invariably got on well\r\nwith small boys. A sympathetic bond seemed instantly to be formed. She\r\nreflected that an ally in the enemy\u2019s camp, so to speak, was not to be\r\ndespised.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, William,\u201d she remarked cheerfully, in the best approved\r\nhospital-early-morning style, \u201cgetting a good shine up?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boy grinned responsively.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlbert, miss,\u201d he corrected.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlbert be it,\u201d said Tuppence. She glanced mysteriously round the hall.\r\nThe effect was purposely a broad one in case Albert should miss it. She\r\nleaned towards the boy and dropped her voice: \u201cI want a word with you,\r\nAlbert.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlbert ceased operations on the fittings and opened his mouth slightly.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook! Do you know what this is?\u201d With a dramatic gesture she flung back\r\nthe left side of her coat and exposed a small enamelled badge. It was\r\nextremely unlikely that Albert would have any knowledge of it--indeed,\r\nit would have been fatal for Tuppence\u2019s plans, since the badge in\r\nquestion was the device of a local training corps originated by the\r\narchdeacon in the early days of the war. Its presence in Tuppence\u2019s coat\r\nwas due to the fact that she had used it for pinning in some flowers a\r\nday or two before. But Tuppence had sharp eyes, and had noted the corner\r\nof a threepenny detective novel protruding from Albert\u2019s pocket, and the\r\nimmediate enlargement of his eyes told her that her tactics were good,\r\nand that the fish would rise to the bait.\r\n\r\n\u201cAmerican Detective Force!\u201d she hissed.\r\n\r\nAlbert fell for it.\r\n\r\n\u201cLord!\u201d he murmured ecstatically.\r\n\r\nTuppence nodded at him with the air of one who has established a\r\nthorough understanding.\r\n\r\n\u201cKnow who I\u2019m after?\u201d she inquired genially.\r\n\r\nAlbert, still round-eyed, demanded breathlessly:\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of the flats?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence nodded and jerked a thumb up the stairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. 20. Calls herself Vandemeyer. Vandemeyer! Ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\r\nAlbert\u2019s hand stole to his pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cA crook?\u201d he queried eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cA crook? I should say so. Ready Rita they call her in the States.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReady Rita,\u201d repeated Albert deliriously. \u201cOh, ain\u2019t it just like the\r\npictures!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was. Tuppence was a great frequenter of the cinema.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnnie always said as how she was a bad lot,\u201d continued the boy.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s Annie?\u201d inquired Tuppence idly.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Ouse-parlourmaid. She\u2019s leaving to-day. Many\u2019s the time Annie\u2019s said\r\nto me: \u2018Mark my words, Albert, I wouldn\u2019t wonder if the police was to\r\ncome after her one of these days.\u2019 Just like that. But she\u2019s a stunner\r\nto look at, ain\u2019t she?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s some peach,\u201d allowed Tuppence carelessly. \u201cFinds it useful in her\r\nlay-out, you bet. Has she been wearing any of the emeralds, by the way?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEmeralds? Them\u2019s the green stones, isn\u2019t they?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re after her for. You know old man Rysdale?\u201d\r\n\r\nAlbert shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cPeter B. Rysdale, the oil king?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems sort of familiar to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe sparklers belonged to him. Finest collection of emeralds in the\r\nworld. Worth a million dollars!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLumme!\u201d came ecstatically from Albert. \u201cIt sounds more like the\r\npictures every minute.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence smiled, gratified at the success of her efforts.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t exactly proved it yet. But we\u2019re after her. And\u201d--she\r\nproduced a long-drawn-out wink--\u201cI guess she won\u2019t get away with the\r\ngoods this time.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlbert uttered another ejaculation indicative of delight.\r\n\r\n\u201cMind you, sonny, not a word of this,\u201d said Tuppence suddenly. \u201cI guess\r\nI oughtn\u2019t to have put you wise, but in the States we know a real smart\r\nlad when we see one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll not breathe a word,\u201d protested Albert eagerly. \u201cAin\u2019t there\r\nanything I could do? A bit of shadowing, maybe, or such like?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence affected to consider, then shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at the moment, but I\u2019ll bear you in mind, son. What\u2019s this about\r\nthe girl you say is leaving?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnnie? Regular turn up, they \u2018ad. As Annie said, servants is some one\r\nnowadays, and to be treated accordingly, and, what with her passing the\r\nword round, she won\u2019t find it so easy to get another.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t she?\u201d said Tuppence thoughtfully. \u201cI wonder----\u201d\r\n\r\nAn idea was dawning in her brain. She thought a minute or two, then\r\ntapped Albert on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee here, son, my brain\u2019s got busy. How would it be if you mentioned\r\nthat you\u2019d got a young cousin, or a friend of yours had, that might suit\r\nthe place. You get me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m there,\u201d said Albert instantly. \u201cYou leave it to me, miss, and I\u2019ll\r\nfix the whole thing up in two ticks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome lad!\u201d commented Tuppence, with a nod of approval. \u201cYou might say\r\nthat the young woman could come in right away. You let me know, and if\r\nit\u2019s O.K. I\u2019ll be round to-morrow at eleven o\u2019clock.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere am I to let you know to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Ritz_,\u201d replied Tuppence laconically. \u201cName of Cowley.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlbert eyed her enviously.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must be a good job, this tec business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt sure is,\u201d drawled Tuppence, \u201cespecially when old man Rysdale backs\r\nthe bill. But don\u2019t fret, son. If this goes well, you shall come in on\r\nthe ground floor.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith which promise she took leave of her new ally, and walked briskly\r\naway from South Audley Mansions, well pleased with her morning\u2019s work.\r\n\r\nBut there was no time to be lost. She went straight back to the _Ritz_\r\nand wrote a few brief words to Mr. Carter. Having dispatched this, and\r\nTommy not having yet returned--which did not surprise her--she started\r\noff on a shopping expedition which, with an interval for tea and\r\nassorted creamy cakes, occupied her until well after six o\u2019clock, and\r\nshe returned to the hotel jaded, but satisfied with her purchases.\r\nStarting with a cheap clothing store, and passing through one or two\r\nsecond-hand establishments, she had finished the day at a well-known\r\nhairdresser\u2019s. Now, in the seclusion of her bedroom, she unwrapped\r\nthat final purchase. Five minutes later she smiled contentedly at her\r\nreflection in the glass. With an actress\u2019s pencil she had slightly\r\naltered the line of her eyebrows, and that, taken in conjunction with\r\nthe new luxuriant growth of fair hair above, so changed her appearance\r\nthat she felt confident that even if she came face to face with\r\nWhittington he would not recognize her. She would wear elevators in her\r\nshoes, and the cap and apron would be an even more valuable disguise.\r\nFrom hospital experience she knew only too well that a nurse out of\r\nuniform is frequently unrecognized by her patients.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Tuppence aloud, nodding at the pert reflection in the glass,\r\n\u201cyou\u2019ll do.\u201d She then resumed her normal appearance.\r\n\r\nDinner was a solitary meal. Tuppence was rather surprised at Tommy\u2019s\r\nnon-return. Julius, too, was absent--but that to the girl\u2019s mind was\r\nmore easily explained. His \u201chustling\u201d activities were not confined\r\nto London, and his abrupt appearances and disappearances were fully\r\naccepted by the Young Adventurers as part of the day\u2019s work. It\r\nwas quite on the cards that Julius P. Hersheimmer had left for\r\nConstantinople at a moment\u2019s notice if he fancied that a clue to his\r\ncousin\u2019s disappearance was to be found there. The energetic young\r\nman had succeeded in making the lives of several Scotland Yard men\r\nunbearable to them, and the telephone girls at the Admiralty had learned\r\nto know and dread the familiar \u201cHullo!\u201d He had spent three hours in\r\nParis hustling the Prefecture, and had returned from there imbued with\r\nthe idea, possibly inspired by a weary French official, that the true\r\nclue to the mystery was to be found in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\u201cI dare say he\u2019s dashed off there now,\u201d thought Tuppence. \u201cAll very\r\nwell, but this is very dull for _me!_ Here I am bursting with news, and\r\nabsolutely no one to tell it to! Tommy might have wired, or something. I\r\nwonder where he is. Anyway, he can\u2019t have \u2018lost the trail\u2019 as they say.\r\nThat reminds me----\u201d And Miss Cowley broke off in her meditations, and\r\nsummoned a small boy.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later the lady was ensconced comfortably on her bed,\r\nsmoking cigarettes and deep in the perusal of _Garnaby Williams, the Boy\r\nDetective_, which, with other threepenny works of lurid fiction, she had\r\nsent out to purchase. She felt, and rightly, that before the strain\r\nof attempting further intercourse with Albert, it would be as well to\r\nfortify herself with a good supply of local colour.\r\n\r\nThe morning brought a note from Mr. Carter:\r\n\r\n\u201cDEAR MISS TUPPENCE,\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have made a splendid start, and I congratulate you. I feel, though,\r\nthat I should like to point out to you once more the risks you are\r\nrunning, especially if you pursue the course you indicate. Those people\r\nare absolutely desperate and incapable of either mercy or pity. I feel\r\nthat you probably underestimate the danger, and therefore warn you\r\nagain that I can promise you no protection. You have given us valuable\r\ninformation, and if you choose to withdraw now no one could blame you.\r\nAt any rate, think the matter over well before you decide.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf, in spite of my warnings, you make up your mind to go through with\r\nit, you will find everything arranged. You have lived for two years with\r\nMiss Dufferin, The Parsonage, Llanelly, and Mrs. Vandemeyer can apply to\r\nher for a reference.\r\n\r\n\u201cMay I be permitted a word or two of advice? Stick as near to the truth\r\nas possible--it minimizes the danger of \u2018slips.\u2019 I suggest that you\r\nshould represent yourself to be what you are, a former V.A.D., who has\r\nchosen domestic service as a profession. There are many such at the\r\npresent time. That explains away any incongruities of voice or manner\r\nwhich otherwise might awaken suspicion.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhichever way you decide, good luck to you.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour sincere friend,\r\n\r\n\u201cMR. CARTER.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence\u2019s spirits rose mercurially. Mr. Carter\u2019s warnings passed\r\nunheeded. The young lady had far too much confidence in herself to pay\r\nany heed to them.\r\n\r\nWith some reluctance she abandoned the interesting part she had sketched\r\nout for herself. Although she had no doubts of her own powers to sustain\r\na role indefinitely, she had too much common sense not to recognize the\r\nforce of Mr. Carter\u2019s arguments.\r\n\r\nThere was still no word or message from Tommy, but the morning post\r\nbrought a somewhat dirty postcard with the words: \u201cIt\u2019s O.K.\u201d scrawled\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nAt ten-thirty Tuppence surveyed with pride a slightly battered tin trunk\r\ncontaining her new possessions. It was artistically corded. It was with\r\na slight blush that she rang the bell and ordered it to be placed in a\r\ntaxi. She drove to Paddington, and left the box in the cloak room.\r\nShe then repaired with a handbag to the fastnesses of the ladies\u2019\r\nwaiting-room. Ten minutes later a metamorphosed Tuppence walked demurely\r\nout of the station and entered a bus.\r\n\r\nIt was a few minutes past eleven when Tuppence again entered the hall\r\nof South Audley Mansions. Albert was on the look-out, attending to his\r\nduties in a somewhat desultory fashion. He did not immediately recognize\r\nTuppence. When he did, his admiration was unbounded.\r\n\r\n\u201cBlest if I\u2019d have known you! That rig-out\u2019s top-hole.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGlad you like it, Albert,\u201d replied Tuppence modestly. \u201cBy the way, am I\r\nyour cousin, or am I not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour voice too,\u201d cried the delighted boy. \u201cIt\u2019s as English as anything!\r\nNo, I said as a friend of mine knew a young gal. Annie wasn\u2019t best\r\npleased. She\u2019s stopped on till to-day--to oblige, _she_ said, but really\r\nit\u2019s so as to put you against the place.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNice girl,\u201d said Tuppence.\r\n\r\nAlbert suspected no irony.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s style about her, and keeps her silver a treat--but, my word,\r\nain\u2019t she got a temper. Are you going up now, miss? Step inside the\r\nlift. No. 20 did you say?\u201d And he winked.\r\n\r\nTuppence quelled him with a stern glance, and stepped inside.\r\n\r\nAs she rang the bell of No. 20 she was conscious of Albert\u2019s eyes slowly\r\ndescending beneath the level of the floor.\r\n\r\nA smart young woman opened the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve come about the place,\u201d said Tuppence.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rotten place,\u201d said the young woman without hesitation. \u201cRegular\r\nold cat--always interfering. Accused me of tampering with her letters.\r\nMe! The flap was half undone anyway. There\u2019s never anything in the\r\nwaste-paper basket--she burns everything. She\u2019s a wrong \u2018un, that\u2019s what\r\nshe is. Swell clothes, but no class. Cook knows something about her--but\r\nshe won\u2019t tell--scared to death of her. And suspicious! She\u2019s on to you\r\nin a minute if you as much as speak to a fellow. I can tell you----\u201d\r\n\r\nBut what more Annie could tell, Tuppence was never destined to learn,\r\nfor at that moment a clear voice with a peculiarly steely ring to it\r\ncalled:\r\n\r\n\u201cAnnie!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe smart young woman jumped as if she had been shot.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a young woman about the situation, ma\u2019am.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShow her in then. At once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence was ushered into a room on the right of the long passage. A\r\nwoman was standing by the fireplace. She was no longer in her first\r\nyouth, and the beauty she undeniably possessed was hardened and\r\ncoarsened. In her youth she must have been dazzling. Her pale gold hair,\r\nowing a slight assistance to art, was coiled low on her neck, her eyes,\r\nof a piercing electric blue, seemed to possess a faculty of boring into\r\nthe very soul of the person she was looking at. Her exquisite figure was\r\nenhanced by a wonderful gown of indigo charmeuse. And yet, despite her\r\nswaying grace, and the almost ethereal beauty of her face, you felt\r\ninstinctively the presence of something hard and menacing, a kind of\r\nmetallic strength that found expression in the tones of her voice and in\r\nthat gimlet-like quality of her eyes.\r\n\r\nFor the first time Tuppence felt afraid. She had not feared Whittington,\r\nbut this woman was different. As if fascinated, she watched the long\r\ncruel line of the red curving mouth, and again she felt that sensation\r\nof panic pass over her. Her usual self-confidence deserted her. Vaguely\r\nshe felt that deceiving this woman would be very different to deceiving\r\nWhittington. Mr. Carter\u2019s warning recurred to her mind. Here, indeed,\r\nshe might expect no mercy.\r\n\r\nFighting down that instinct of panic which urged her to turn tail and\r\nrun without further delay, Tuppence returned the lady\u2019s gaze firmly and\r\nrespectfully.\r\n\r\nAs though that first scrutiny had been satisfactory, Mrs. Vandemeyer\r\nmotioned to a chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can sit down. How did you hear I wanted a house-parlourmaid?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThrough a friend who knows the lift boy here. He thought the place\r\nmight suit me.\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain that basilisk glance seemed to pierce her through.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou speak like an educated girl?\u201d\r\n\r\nGlibly enough, Tuppence ran through her imaginary career on the lines\r\nsuggested by Mr. Carter. It seemed to her, as she did so, that the\r\ntension of Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s attitude relaxed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d she remarked at length. \u201cIs there anyone I can write to for a\r\nreference?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI lived last with a Miss Dufferin, The Parsonage, Llanelly. I was with\r\nher two years.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then you thought you would get more money by coming to London,\r\nI suppose? Well, it doesn\u2019t matter to me. I will give you\r\n\u00a350--\u00a360--whatever you want. You can come in at once?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. To-day, if you like. My box is at Paddington.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo and fetch it in a taxi, then. It\u2019s an easy place. I am out a good\r\ndeal. By the way, what\u2019s your name?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrudence Cooper, ma\u2019am.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well, Prudence. Go away and fetch your box. I shall be out to\r\nlunch. The cook will show you where everything is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence withdrew. The smart Annie was not in evidence. In the hall\r\nbelow a magnificent hall porter had relegated Albert to the background.\r\nTuppence did not even glance at him as she passed meekly out.\r\n\r\nThe adventure had begun, but she felt less elated than she had done\r\nearlier in the morning. It crossed her mind that if the unknown Jane\r\nFinn had fallen into the hands of Mrs. Vandemeyer, it was likely to have\r\ngone hard with her.\r\n\nTUPPENCE betrayed no awkwardness in her new duties. The daughters of the\r\narchdeacon were well grounded in household tasks. They were also experts\r\nin training a \u201craw girl,\u201d the inevitable result being that the raw girl,\r\nonce trained, departed elsewhere where her newly acquired knowledge\r\ncommanded a more substantial remuneration than the archdeacon\u2019s meagre\r\npurse allowed.\r\n\r\nTuppence had therefore very little fear of proving inefficient. Mrs.\r\nVandemeyer\u2019s cook puzzled her. She evidently went in deadly terror of\r\nher mistress. The girl thought it probable that the other woman had some\r\nhold over her. For the rest, she cooked like a _chef_, as Tuppence had\r\nan opportunity of judging that evening. Mrs. Vandemeyer was expecting a\r\nguest to dinner, and Tuppence accordingly laid the beautifully polished\r\ntable for two. She was a little exercised in her own mind as to this\r\nvisitor. It was highly possible that it might prove to be Whittington.\r\nAlthough she felt fairly confident that he would not recognize her, yet\r\nshe would have been better pleased had the guest proved to be a total\r\nstranger. However, there was nothing for it but to hope for the best.\r\n\r\nAt a few minutes past eight the front door bell rang, and Tuppence went\r\nto answer it with some inward trepidation. She was relieved to see that\r\nthe visitor was the second of the two men whom Tommy had taken upon\r\nhimself to follow.\r\n\r\nHe gave his name as Count Stepanov. Tuppence announced him, and Mrs.\r\nVandemeyer rose from her seat on a low divan with a quick murmur of\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is delightful to see you, Boris Ivanovitch,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you, madame!\u201d He bowed low over her hand.\r\n\r\nTuppence returned to the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\u201cCount Stepanov, or some such,\u201d she remarked, and affecting a frank and\r\nunvarnished curiosity: \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA Russian gentleman, I believe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome here much?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnce in a while. What d\u2019you want to know for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFancied he might be sweet on the missus, that\u2019s all,\u201d explained the\r\ngirl, adding with an appearance of sulkiness: \u201cHow you do take one up!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not quite easy in my mind about the _souffl\u00e9_,\u201d explained the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know something,\u201d thought Tuppence to herself, but aloud she only\r\nsaid: \u201cGoing to dish up now? Right-o.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhilst waiting at table, Tuppence listened closely to all that was said.\r\nShe remembered that this was one of the men Tommy was shadowing when she\r\nhad last seen him. Already, although she would hardly admit it, she was\r\nbecoming uneasy about her partner. Where was he? Why had no word of any\r\nkind come from him? She had arranged before leaving the _Ritz_ to have\r\nall letters or messages sent on at once by special messenger to a small\r\nstationer\u2019s shop near at hand where Albert was to call in frequently.\r\nTrue, it was only yesterday morning that she had parted from Tommy, and\r\nshe told herself that any anxiety on his behalf would be absurd. Still,\r\nit was strange that he had sent no word of any kind.\r\n\r\nBut, listen as she might, the conversation presented no clue. Boris and\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer talked on purely indifferent subjects: plays they had\r\nseen, new dances, and the latest society gossip. After dinner they\r\nrepaired to the small boudoir where Mrs. Vandemeyer, stretched on the\r\ndivan, looked more wickedly beautiful than ever. Tuppence brought in the\r\ncoffee and liqueurs and unwillingly retired. As she did so, she heard\r\nBoris say:\r\n\r\n\u201cNew, isn\u2019t she?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe came in to-day. The other was a fiend. This girl seems all right.\r\nShe waits well.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence lingered a moment longer by the door which she had carefully\r\nneglected to close, and heard him say:\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite safe, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally, Boris, you are absurdly suspicious. I believe she\u2019s the cousin\r\nof the hall porter, or something of the kind. And nobody even dreams\r\nthat I have any connection with our--mutual friend, Mr. Brown.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, be careful, Rita. That door isn\u2019t shut.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, shut it then,\u201d laughed the woman.\r\n\r\nTuppence removed herself speedily.\r\n\r\nShe dared not absent herself longer from the back premises, but she\r\ncleared away and washed up with a breathless speed acquired in hospital.\r\nThen she slipped quietly back to the boudoir door. The cook, more\r\nleisurely, was still busy in the kitchen and, if she missed the other,\r\nwould only suppose her to be turning down the beds.\r\n\r\nAlas! The conversation inside was being carried on in too low a tone\r\nto permit of her hearing anything of it. She dared not reopen the\r\ndoor, however gently. Mrs. Vandemeyer was sitting almost facing it, and\r\nTuppence respected her mistress\u2019s lynx-eyed powers of observation.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she felt she would give a good deal to overhear what was\r\ngoing on. Possibly, if anything unforeseen had happened, she might get\r\nnews of Tommy. For some moments she reflected desperately, then her\r\nface brightened. She went quickly along the passage to Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s\r\nbedroom, which had long French windows leading on to a balcony that ran\r\nthe length of the flat. Slipping quickly through the window, Tuppence\r\ncrept noiselessly along till she reached the boudoir window. As she\r\nhad thought it stood a little ajar, and the voices within were plainly\r\naudible.\r\n\r\nTuppence listened attentively, but there was no mention of anything\r\nthat could be twisted to apply to Tommy. Mrs. Vandemeyer and the Russian\r\nseemed to be at variance over some matter, and finally the latter\r\nexclaimed bitterly:\r\n\r\n\u201cWith your persistent recklessness, you will end by ruining us!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBah!\u201d laughed the woman. \u201cNotoriety of the right kind is the best way\r\nof disarming suspicion. You will realize that one of these days--perhaps\r\nsooner than you think!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the meantime, you are going about everywhere with Peel Edgerton.\r\nNot only is he, perhaps, the most celebrated K.C. in England, but his\r\nspecial hobby is criminology! It is madness!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know that his eloquence has saved untold men from the gallows,\u201d said\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer calmly. \u201cWhat of it? I may need his assistance in that\r\nline myself some day. If so, how fortunate to have such a friend at\r\ncourt--or perhaps it would be more to the point to say _in_ court.\u201d\r\n\r\nBoris got up and began striding up and down. He was very excited.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are a clever woman, Rita; but you are also a fool! Be guided by me,\r\nand give up Peel Edgerton.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer shook her head gently.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou refuse?\u201d There was an ugly ring in the Russian\u2019s voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, by Heaven,\u201d snarled the Russian, \u201cwe will see----\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Vandemeyer also rose to her feet, her eyes flashing.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou forget, Boris,\u201d she said. \u201cI am accountable to no one. I take my\r\norders only from--Mr. Brown.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe other threw up his hands in despair.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are impossible,\u201d he muttered. \u201cImpossible! Already it may be too\r\nlate. They say Peel Edgerton can _smell_ a criminal! How do we know what\r\nis at the bottom of his sudden interest in you? Perhaps even now his\r\nsuspicions are aroused. He guesses----\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer eyed him scornfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cReassure yourself, my dear Boris. He suspects nothing. With less than\r\nyour usual chivalry, you seem to forget that I am commonly accounted a\r\nbeautiful woman. I assure you that is all that interests Peel Edgerton.\u201d\r\n\r\nBoris shook his head doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has studied crime as no other man in this kingdom has studied it. Do\r\nyou fancy that you can deceive him?\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s eyes narrowed.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf he is all that you say--it would amuse me to try!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens, Rita----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBesides,\u201d added Mrs. Vandemeyer, \u201che is extremely rich. I am not one\r\nwho despises money. The \u2018sinews of war,\u2019 you know, Boris!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMoney--money! That is always the danger with you, Rita. I believe you\r\nwould sell your soul for money. I believe----\u201d He paused, then in a\r\nlow, sinister voice he said slowly: \u201cSometimes I believe that you would\r\nsell-- _us!_\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer smiled and shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe price, at any rate, would have to be enormous,\u201d she said lightly.\r\n\u201cIt would be beyond the power of anyone but a millionaire to pay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d snarled the Russian. \u201cYou see, I was right!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Boris, can you not take a joke?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas it a joke?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen all I can say is that your ideas of humour are peculiar, my dear\r\nRita.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us not quarrel, Boris. Touch the bell. We will have some drinks.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence beat a hasty retreat. She paused a moment to survey herself in\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s long glass, and be sure that nothing was amiss with\r\nher appearance. Then she answered the bell demurely.\r\n\r\nThe conversation that she had overheard, although interesting in that\r\nit proved beyond doubt the complicity of both Rita and Boris, threw very\r\nlittle light on the present preoccupations. The name of Jane Finn had\r\nnot even been mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe following morning a few brief words with Albert informed her that\r\nnothing was waiting for her at the stationer\u2019s. It seemed incredible\r\nthat Tommy, if all was well with him, should not send any word to her.\r\nA cold hand seemed to close round her heart.... Supposing.... She choked\r\nher fears down bravely. It was no good worrying. But she leapt at a\r\nchance offered her by Mrs. Vandemeyer.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat day do you usually go out, Prudence?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFriday\u2019s my usual day, ma\u2019am.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer lifted her eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd to-day is Friday! But I suppose you hardly wish to go out to-day,\r\nas you only came yesterday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was thinking of asking you if I might, ma\u2019am.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer looked at her a minute longer, and then smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish Count Stepanov could hear you. He made a suggestion about\r\nyou last night.\u201d Her smile broadened, catlike. \u201cYour request is\r\nvery--typical. I am satisfied. You do not understand all this--but\r\nyou can go out to-day. It makes no difference to me, as I shall not be\r\ndining at home.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence felt a sensation of relief once she was out of the other\u2019s\r\npresence. Once again she admitted to herself that she was afraid,\r\nhorribly afraid, of the beautiful woman with the cruel eyes.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of a final desultory polishing of her silver, Tuppence was\r\ndisturbed by the ringing of the front door bell, and went to answer it.\r\nThis time the visitor was neither Whittington nor Boris, but a man of\r\nstriking appearance.\r\n\r\nJust a shade over average height, he nevertheless conveyed the\r\nimpression of a big man. His face, clean-shaven and exquisitely mobile,\r\nwas stamped with an expression of power and force far beyond the\r\nordinary. Magnetism seemed to radiate from him.\r\n\r\nTuppence was undecided for the moment whether to put him down as an\r\nactor or a lawyer, but her doubts were soon solved as he gave her his\r\nname: Sir James Peel Edgerton.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with renewed interest. This, then, was the famous K.C.\r\nwhose name was familiar all over England. She had heard it said that he\r\nmight one day be Prime Minister. He was known to have refused office in\r\nthe interests of his profession, preferring to remain a simple Member\r\nfor a Scotch constituency.\r\n\r\nTuppence went back to her pantry thoughtfully. The great man had\r\nimpressed her. She understood Boris\u2019s agitation. Peel Edgerton would not\r\nbe an easy man to deceive.\r\n\r\nIn about a quarter of an hour the bell rang, and Tuppence repaired to\r\nthe hall to show the visitor out. He had given her a piercing glance\r\nbefore. Now, as she handed him his hat and stick, she was conscious of\r\nhis eyes raking her through. As she opened the door and stood aside to\r\nlet him pass out, he stopped in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot been doing this long, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence raised her eyes, astonished. She read in his glance kindliness,\r\nand something else more difficult to fathom.\r\n\r\nHe nodded as though she had answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cV.A.D. and hard up, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid Mrs. Vandemeyer tell you that?\u201d asked Tuppence suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, child. The look of you told me. Good place here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good, thank you, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, but there are plenty of good places nowadays. And a change does no\r\nharm sometimes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean----?\u201d began Tuppence.\r\n\r\nBut Sir James was already on the topmost stair. He looked back with his\r\nkindly, shrewd glance.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust a hint,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence went back to the pantry more thoughtful than ever.\r\n\nDRESSED appropriately, Tuppence duly sallied forth for her \u201cafternoon\r\nout.\u201d Albert was in temporary abeyance, but Tuppence went herself to the\r\nstationer\u2019s to make quite sure that nothing had come for her. Satisfied\r\non this point, she made her way to the _Ritz_. On inquiry she learnt\r\nthat Tommy had not yet returned. It was the answer she had expected, but\r\nit was another nail in the coffin of her hopes. She resolved to appeal\r\nto Mr. Carter, telling him when and where Tommy had started on his\r\nquest, and asking him to do something to trace him. The prospect of\r\nhis aid revived her mercurial spirits, and she next inquired for Julius\r\nHersheimmer. The reply she got was to the effect that he had returned\r\nabout half an hour ago, but had gone out immediately.\r\n\r\nTuppence\u2019s spirits revived still more. It would be something to see\r\nJulius. Perhaps he could devise some plan for finding out what\r\nhad become of Tommy. She wrote her note to Mr. Carter in Julius\u2019s\r\nsitting-room, and was just addressing the envelope when the door burst\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the hell----\u201d began Julius, but checked himself abruptly. \u201cI beg\r\nyour pardon, Miss Tuppence. Those fools down at the office would have it\r\nthat Beresford wasn\u2019t here any longer--hadn\u2019t been here since Wednesday.\r\nIs that so?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know where he is?\u201d she asked faintly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI? How should I know? I haven\u2019t had one darned word from him, though I\r\nwired him yesterday morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI expect your wire\u2019s at the office unopened.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut where is he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I hoped you might.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you I haven\u2019t had one darned word from him since we parted at\r\nthe depot on Wednesday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat depot?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWaterloo. Your London and South Western road.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWaterloo?\u201d frowned Tuppence.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, yes. Didn\u2019t he tell you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him either,\u201d replied Tuppence impatiently. \u201cGo on about\r\nWaterloo. What were you doing there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe gave me a call. Over the phone. Told me to get a move on, and\r\nhustle. Said he was trailing two crooks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Tuppence, her eyes opening. \u201cI see. Go on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hurried along right away. Beresford was there. He pointed out the\r\ncrooks. The big one was mine, the guy you bluffed. Tommy shoved a ticket\r\ninto my hand and told me to get aboard the cars. He was going to sleuth\r\nthe other crook.\u201d Julius paused. \u201cI thought for sure you\u2019d know all\r\nthis.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJulius,\u201d said Tuppence firmly, \u201cstop walking up and down. It makes me\r\ngiddy. Sit down in that armchair, and tell me the whole story with as\r\nfew fancy turns of speech as possible.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Hersheimmer obeyed.\r\n\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere shall I begin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere you left off. At Waterloo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d began Julius, \u201cI got into one of your dear old-fashioned\r\nfirst-class British compartments. The train was just off. First thing I\r\nknew a guard came along and informed me mighty politely that I wasn\u2019t\r\nin a smoking-carriage. I handed him out half a dollar, and that settled\r\nthat. I did a bit of prospecting along the corridor to the next coach.\r\nWhittington was there right enough. When I saw the skunk, with his big\r\nsleek fat face, and thought of poor little Jane in his clutches, I felt\r\nreal mad that I hadn\u2019t got a gun with me. I\u2019d have tickled him up some.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe got to Bournemouth all right. Whittington took a cab and gave the\r\nname of an hotel. I did likewise, and we drove up within three minutes\r\nof each other. He hired a room, and I hired one too. So far it was all\r\nplain sailing. He hadn\u2019t the remotest notion that anyone was on to him.\r\nWell, he just sat around in the hotel lounge, reading the papers and so\r\non, till it was time for dinner. He didn\u2019t hurry any over that either.\r\n\r\n\u201cI began to think that there was nothing doing, that he\u2019d just come on\r\nthe trip for his health, but I remembered that he hadn\u2019t changed for\r\ndinner, though it was by way of being a slap-up hotel, so it seemed\r\nlikely enough that he\u2019d be going out on his real business afterwards.\r\n\r\n\u201cSure enough, about nine o\u2019clock, so he did. Took a car across the\r\ntown--mighty pretty place by the way, I guess I\u2019ll take Jane there for\r\na spell when I find her--and then paid it off and struck out along those\r\npine-woods on the top of the cliff. I was there too, you understand.\r\nWe walked, maybe, for half an hour. There\u2019s a lot of villas all the way\r\nalong, but by degrees they seemed to get more and more thinned out, and\r\nin the end we got to one that seemed the last of the bunch. Big house it\r\nwas, with a lot of piny grounds around it.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a pretty black night, and the carriage drive up to the house was\r\ndark as pitch. I could hear him ahead, though I couldn\u2019t see him. I\r\nhad to walk carefully in case he might get on to it that he was being\r\nfollowed. I turned a curve and I was just in time to see him ring the\r\nbell and get admitted to the house. I just stopped where I was. It was\r\nbeginning to rain, and I was soon pretty near soaked through. Also, it\r\nwas almighty cold.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhittington didn\u2019t come out again, and by and by I got kind of restive,\r\nand began to mouch around. All the ground floor windows were shuttered\r\ntight, but upstairs, on the first floor (it was a two-storied house) I\r\nnoticed a window with a light burning and the curtains not drawn.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, just opposite to that window, there was a tree growing. It was\r\nabout thirty foot away from the house, maybe, and I sort of got it into\r\nmy head that, if I climbed up that tree, I\u2019d very likely be able to see\r\ninto that room. Of course, I knew there was no reason why Whittington\r\nshould be in that room rather than in any other--less reason, in fact,\r\nfor the betting would be on his being in one of the reception-rooms\r\ndownstairs. But I guess I\u2019d got the hump from standing so long in the\r\nrain, and anything seemed better than going on doing nothing. So I\r\nstarted up.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so easy, by a long chalk! The rain had made the boughs mighty\r\nslippery, and it was all I could do to keep a foothold, but bit by bit I\r\nmanaged it, until at last there I was level with the window.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut then I was disappointed. I was too far to the left. I could only\r\nsee sideways into the room. A bit of curtain, and a yard of wallpaper\r\nwas all I could command. Well, that wasn\u2019t any manner of good to me, but\r\njust as I was going to give it up, and climb down ignominiously, some\r\none inside moved and threw his shadow on my little bit of wall--and, by\r\ngum, it was Whittington!\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter that, my blood was up. I\u2019d just _got_ to get a look into that\r\nroom. It was up to me to figure out how. I noticed that there was a long\r\nbranch running out from the tree in the right direction. If I could only\r\nswarm about half-way along it, the proposition would be solved. But it\r\nwas mighty uncertain whether it would bear my weight. I decided I\u2019d\r\njust got to risk that, and I started. Very cautiously, inch by inch, I\r\ncrawled along. The bough creaked and swayed in a nasty fashion, and it\r\ndidn\u2019t do to think of the drop below, but at last I got safely to where\r\nI wanted to be.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe room was medium-sized, furnished in a kind of bare hygienic way.\r\nThere was a table with a lamp on it in the middle of the room, and\r\nsitting at that table, facing towards me, was Whittington right enough.\r\nHe was talking to a woman dressed as a hospital nurse. She was sitting\r\nwith her back to me, so I couldn\u2019t see her face. Although the blinds\r\nwere up, the window itself was shut, so I couldn\u2019t catch a word of what\r\nthey said. Whittington seemed to be doing all the talking, and the nurse\r\njust listened. Now and then she nodded, and sometimes she\u2019d shake\r\nher head, as though she were answering questions. He seemed very\r\nemphatic--once or twice he beat with his fist on the table. The rain had\r\nstopped now, and the sky was clearing in that sudden way it does.\r\n\r\n\u201cPresently, he seemed to get to the end of what he was saying. He got\r\nup, and so did she. He looked towards the window and asked something--I\r\nguess it was whether it was raining. Anyway, she came right across and\r\nlooked out. Just then the moon came out from behind the clouds. I\r\nwas scared the woman would catch sight of me, for I was full in the\r\nmoonlight. I tried to move back a bit. The jerk I gave was too much for\r\nthat rotten old branch. With an almighty crash, down it came, and Julius\r\nP. Hersheimmer with it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Julius,\u201d breathed Tuppence, \u201chow exciting! Go on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, luckily for me, I pitched down into a good soft bed of earth--but\r\nit put me out of action for the time, sure enough. The next thing I\r\nknew, I was lying in bed with a hospital nurse (not Whittington\u2019s one)\r\non one side of me, and a little black-bearded man with gold glasses,\r\nand medical man written all over him, on the other. He rubbed his hands\r\ntogether, and raised his eyebrows as I stared at him. \u2018Ah!\u2019 he said. \u2018So\r\nour young friend is coming round again. Capital. Capital.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI did the usual stunt. Said: \u2018What\u2019s happened?\u2019 And \u2018Where am I?\u2019 But\r\nI knew the answer to the last well enough. There\u2019s no moss growing on\r\nmy brain. \u2018I think that\u2019ll do for the present, sister,\u2019 said the little\r\nman, and the nurse left the room in a sort of brisk well-trained way.\r\nBut I caught her handing me out a look of deep curiosity as she passed\r\nthrough the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat look of hers gave me an idea. \u2018Now then, doc,\u2019 I said, and tried\r\nto sit up in bed, but my right foot gave me a nasty twinge as I did so.\r\n\u2018A slight sprain,\u2019 explained the doctor. \u2018Nothing serious. You\u2019ll be\r\nabout again in a couple of days.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI noticed you walked lame,\u201d interpolated Tuppence.\r\n\r\nJulius nodded, and continued:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018How did it happen?\u2019 I asked again. He replied dryly. \u2018You fell, with\r\na considerable portion of one of my trees, into one of my newly planted\r\nflower-beds.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI liked the man. He seemed to have a sense of humour. I felt sure that\r\nhe, at least, was plumb straight. \u2018Sure, doc,\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry about\r\nthe tree, and I guess the new bulbs will be on me. But perhaps you\u2019d\r\nlike to know what I was doing in your garden?\u2019 \u2018I think the facts do\r\ncall for an explanation,\u2019 he replied. \u2018Well, to begin with, I wasn\u2019t\r\nafter the spoons.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe smiled. \u2018My first theory. But I soon altered my mind. By the way,\r\nyou are an American, are you not?\u2019 I told him my name. \u2018And you?\u2019 \u2018I am\r\nDr. Hall, and this, as you doubtless know, is my private nursing home.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know, but I wasn\u2019t going to put him wise. I was just thankful\r\nfor the information. I liked the man, and I felt he was straight, but\r\nI wasn\u2019t going to give him the whole story. For one thing he probably\r\nwouldn\u2019t have believed it.\r\n\r\n\u201cI made up my mind in a flash. \u2018Why, doctor,\u2019 I said, \u2018I guess I feel\r\nan almighty fool, but I owe it to you to let you know that it wasn\u2019t\r\nthe Bill Sikes business I was up to.\u2019 Then I went on and mumbled out\r\nsomething about a girl. I trotted out the stern guardian business, and a\r\nnervous breakdown, and finally explained that I had fancied I recognized\r\nher among the patients at the home, hence my nocturnal adventures. I\r\nguess it was just the kind of story he was expecting. \u2018Quite a romance,\u2019\r\nhe said genially, when I\u2019d finished. \u2018Now, doc,\u2019 I went on, \u2018will you\r\nbe frank with me? Have you here now, or have you had here at any time,\r\na young girl called Jane Finn?\u2019 He repeated the name thoughtfully. \u2018Jane\r\nFinn?\u2019 he said. \u2018No.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cI was chagrined, and I guess I showed it. \u2018You are sure?\u2019 \u2018Quite sure,\r\nMr. Hersheimmer. It is an uncommon name, and I should not have been\r\nlikely to forget it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that was flat. It laid me out for a space. I\u2019d kind of hoped\r\nmy search was at an end. \u2018That\u2019s that,\u2019 I said at last. \u2018Now, there\u2019s\r\nanother matter. When I was hugging that darned branch I thought I\r\nrecognized an old friend of mine talking to one of your nurses.\u2019 I\r\npurposely didn\u2019t mention any name because, of course, Whittington might\r\nbe calling himself something quite different down here, but the doctor\r\nanswered at once. \u2018Mr. Whittington, perhaps?\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s the fellow,\u2019 I\r\nreplied. \u2018What\u2019s he doing down here? Don\u2019t tell me _his_ nerves are out\r\nof order?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Hall laughed. \u2018No. He came down to see one of my nurses, Nurse\r\nEdith, who is a niece of his.\u2019 \u2018Why, fancy that!\u2019 I exclaimed. \u2018Is he\r\nstill here?\u2019 \u2018No, he went back to town almost immediately.\u2019 \u2018What a\r\npity!\u2019 I ejaculated. \u2018But perhaps I could speak to his niece--Nurse\r\nEdith, did you say her name was?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the doctor shook his head. \u2018I\u2019m afraid that, too, is impossible.\r\nNurse Edith left with a patient to-night also.\u2019 \u2018I seem to be real\r\nunlucky,\u2019 I remarked. \u2018Have you Mr. Whittington\u2019s address in town?\r\nI guess I\u2019d like to look him up when I get back.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know his\r\naddress. I can write to Nurse Edith for it if you like.\u2019 I thanked him.\r\n\u2018Don\u2019t say who it is wants it. I\u2019d like to give him a little surprise.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was about all I could do for the moment. Of course, if the girl\r\nwas really Whittington\u2019s niece, she might be too cute to fall into the\r\ntrap, but it was worth trying. Next thing I did was to write out a wire\r\nto Beresford saying where I was, and that I was laid up with a sprained\r\nfoot, and telling him to come down if he wasn\u2019t busy. I had to be\r\nguarded in what I said. However, I didn\u2019t hear from him, and my foot\r\nsoon got all right. It was only ricked, not really sprained, so to-day I\r\nsaid good-bye to the little doctor chap, asked him to send me word if\r\nhe heard from Nurse Edith, and came right away back to town. Say, Miss\r\nTuppence, you\u2019re looking mighty pale!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Tommy,\u201d said Tuppence. \u201cWhat can have happened to him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBuck up, I guess he\u2019s all right really. Why shouldn\u2019t he be? See here,\r\nit was a foreign-looking guy he went off after. Maybe they\u2019ve gone\r\nabroad--to Poland, or something like that?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t without passports and things. Besides I\u2019ve seen that man,\r\nBoris Something, since. He dined with Mrs. Vandemeyer last night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Who?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI forgot. Of course you don\u2019t know all that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d said Julius, and gave vent to his favourite expression.\r\n\u201cPut me wise.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence thereupon related the events of the last two days. Julius\u2019s\r\nastonishment and admiration were unbounded.\r\n\r\n\u201cBully for you! Fancy you a menial. It just tickles me to death!\u201d Then\r\nhe added seriously: \u201cBut say now, I don\u2019t like it, Miss Tuppence, I sure\r\ndon\u2019t. You\u2019re just as plucky as they make \u2018em, but I wish you\u2019d keep\r\nright out of this. These crooks we\u2019re up against would as soon croak a\r\ngirl as a man any day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you think I\u2019m afraid?\u201d said Tuppence indignantly, valiantly\r\nrepressing memories of the steely glitter in Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI said before you were darned plucky. But that doesn\u2019t alter facts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, bother _me!_\u201d said Tuppence impatiently. \u201cLet\u2019s think about what\r\ncan have happened to Tommy. I\u2019ve written to Mr. Carter about it,\u201d she\r\nadded, and told him the gist of her letter.\r\n\r\nJulius nodded gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s good as far as it goes. But it\u2019s for us to get busy and\r\ndo something.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d asked Tuppence, her spirits rising.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess we\u2019d better get on the track of Boris. You say he\u2019s been to\r\nyour place. Is he likely to come again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe might. I really don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see. Well, I guess I\u2019d better buy a car, a slap-up one, dress as a\r\nchauffeur and hang about outside. Then if Boris comes, you could make\r\nsome kind of signal, and I\u2019d trail him. How\u2019s that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSplendid, but he mightn\u2019t come for weeks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to chance that. I\u2019m glad you like the plan.\u201d He rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo buy the car, of course,\u201d replied Julius, surprised. \u201cWhat make do\r\nyou like? I guess you\u2019ll do some riding in it before we\u2019ve finished.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Tuppence faintly, \u201cI _like_ Rolls-Royces, but----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d agreed Julius. \u201cWhat you say goes. I\u2019ll get one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t at once,\u201d cried Tuppence. \u201cPeople wait ages sometimes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLittle Julius doesn\u2019t,\u201d affirmed Mr. Hersheimmer. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry any.\r\nI\u2019ll be round in the car in half an hour.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence got up.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re awfully good, Julius. But I can\u2019t help feeling that it\u2019s rather\r\na forlorn hope. I\u2019m really pinning my faith to Mr. Carter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust an idea of mine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh; but he must do something. There\u2019s no one else. By the way, I forgot\r\nto tell you of a queer thing that happened this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd she narrated her encounter with Sir James Peel Edgerton. Julius was\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did the guy mean, do you think?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t quite know,\u201d said Tuppence meditatively. \u201cBut I think that, in\r\nan ambiguous, legal, without prejudishish lawyer\u2019s way, he was trying to\r\nwarn me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy should he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d confessed Tuppence. \u201cBut he looked kind, and\r\nsimply awfully clever. I wouldn\u2019t mind going to him and telling him\r\neverything.\u201d\r\n\r\nSomewhat to her surprise, Julius negatived the idea sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee here,\u201d he said, \u201cwe don\u2019t want any lawyers mixed up in this. That\r\nguy couldn\u2019t help us any.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I believe he could,\u201d reiterated Tuppence obstinately.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think it. So long. I\u2019ll be back in half an hour.\u201d\r\n\r\nThirty-five minutes had elapsed when Julius returned. He took Tuppence\r\nby the arm, and walked her to the window.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere she is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Tuppence with a note of reverence in her voice, as she gazed\r\ndown at the enormous car.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s some pace-maker, I can tell you,\u201d said Julius complacently.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you get it?\u201d gasped Tuppence.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was just being sent home to some bigwig.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI went round to his house,\u201d said Julius. \u201cI said that I reckoned a car\r\nlike that was worth every penny of twenty thousand dollars. Then I told\r\nhim that it was worth just about fifty thousand dollars to me if he\u2019d\r\nget out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d said Tuppence, intoxicated.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d returned Julius, \u201che got out, that\u2019s all.\u201d\r\n\nFRIDAY and Saturday passed uneventfully. Tuppence had received a brief\r\nanswer to her appeal from Mr. Carter. In it he pointed out that the\r\nYoung Adventurers had undertaken the work at their own risk, and had\r\nbeen fully warned of the dangers. If anything had happened to Tommy he\r\nregretted it deeply, but he could do nothing.\r\n\r\nThis was cold comfort. Somehow, without Tommy, all the savour went out\r\nof the adventure, and, for the first time, Tuppence felt doubtful of\r\nsuccess. While they had been together she had never questioned it for\r\na minute. Although she was accustomed to take the lead, and to pride\r\nherself on her quick-wittedness, in reality she had relied upon Tommy\r\nmore than she realized at the time. There was something so eminently\r\nsober and clear-headed about him, his common sense and soundness of\r\nvision were so unvarying, that without him Tuppence felt much like a\r\nrudderless ship. It was curious that Julius, who was undoubtedly much\r\ncleverer than Tommy, did not give her the same feeling of support. She\r\nhad accused Tommy of being a pessimist, and it is certain that he\r\nalways saw the disadvantages and difficulties which she herself was\r\noptimistically given to overlooking, but nevertheless she had really\r\nrelied a good deal on his judgment. He might be slow, but he was very\r\nsure.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to the girl that, for the first time, she realized the\r\nsinister character of the mission they had undertaken so lightheartedly.\r\nIt had begun like a page of romance. Now, shorn of its glamour, it\r\nseemed to be turning to grim reality. Tommy--that was all that mattered.\r\nMany times in the day Tuppence blinked the tears out of her eyes\r\nresolutely. \u201cLittle fool,\u201d she would apostrophize herself, \u201cdon\u2019t\r\nsnivel. Of course you\u2019re fond of him. You\u2019ve known him all your life.\r\nBut there\u2019s no need to be sentimental about it.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, nothing more was seen of Boris. He did not come to the\r\nflat, and Julius and the car waited in vain. Tuppence gave herself over\r\nto new meditations. Whilst admitting the truth of Julius\u2019s objections,\r\nshe had nevertheless not entirely relinquished the idea of appealing to\r\nSir James Peel Edgerton. Indeed, she had gone so far as to look up his\r\naddress in the _Red Book_. Had he meant to warn her that day? If so,\r\nwhy? Surely she was at least entitled to demand an explanation. He had\r\nlooked at her so kindly. Perhaps he might tell them something concerning\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer which might lead to a clue to Tommy\u2019s whereabouts.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Tuppence decided, with her usual shake of the shoulders, it was\r\nworth trying, and try it she would. Sunday was her afternoon out. She\r\nwould meet Julius, persuade him to her point of view, and they would\r\nbeard the lion in his den.\r\n\r\nWhen the day arrived Julius needed a considerable amount of persuading,\r\nbut Tuppence held firm. \u201cIt can do no harm,\u201d was what she always came\r\nback to. In the end Julius gave in, and they proceeded in the car to\r\nCarlton House Terrace.\r\n\r\nThe door was opened by an irreproachable butler. Tuppence felt a little\r\nnervous. After all, perhaps it _was_ colossal cheek on her part. She\r\nhad decided not to ask if Sir James was \u201cat home,\u201d but to adopt a more\r\npersonal attitude.\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you ask Sir James if I can see him for a few minutes? I have an\r\nimportant message for him.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe butler retired, returning a moment or two later.\r\n\r\n\u201cSir James will see you. Will you step this way?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe ushered them into a room at the back of the house, furnished as a\r\nlibrary. The collection of books was a magnificent one, and Tuppence\r\nnoticed that all one wall was devoted to works on crime and criminology.\r\nThere were several deep-padded leather arm-chairs, and an old-fashioned\r\nopen hearth. In the window was a big roll-top desk strewn with papers at\r\nwhich the master of the house was sitting.\r\n\r\nHe rose as they entered.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a message for me? Ah\u201d--he recognized Tuppence with a\r\nsmile--\u201cit\u2019s you, is it? Brought a message from Mrs. Vandemeyer, I\r\nsuppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot exactly,\u201d said Tuppence. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m afraid I only said that to\r\nbe quite sure of getting in. Oh, by the way, this is Mr. Hersheimmer,\r\nSir James Peel Edgerton.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPleased to meet you,\u201d said the American, shooting out a hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t you both sit down?\u201d asked Sir James. He drew forward two chairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cSir James,\u201d said Tuppence, plunging boldly, \u201cI dare say you will think\r\nit is most awful cheek of me coming here like this. Because, of course,\r\nit\u2019s nothing whatever to do with you, and then you\u2019re a very important\r\nperson, and of course Tommy and I are very unimportant.\u201d She paused for\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n\u201cTommy?\u201d queried Sir James, looking across at the American.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s Julius,\u201d explained Tuppence. \u201cI\u2019m rather nervous, and that\r\nmakes me tell it badly. What I really want to know is what you meant by\r\nwhat you said to me the other day? Did you mean to warn me against Mrs.\r\nVandemeyer? You did, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear young lady, as far as I recollect I only mentioned that there\r\nwere equally good situations to be obtained elsewhere.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I know. But it was a hint, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, perhaps it was,\u201d admitted Sir James gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I want to know more. I want to know just _why_ you gave me a\r\nhint.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir James smiled at her earnestness.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuppose the lady brings a libel action against me for defamation of\r\ncharacter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Tuppence. \u201cI know lawyers are always dreadfully\r\ncareful. But can\u2019t we say \u2018without prejudice\u2019 first, and then say just\r\nwhat we want to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Sir James, still smiling, \u201cwithout prejudice, then, if I\r\nhad a young sister forced to earn her living, I should not like to see\r\nher in Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s service. I felt it incumbent on me just to give\r\nyou a hint. It is no place for a young and inexperienced girl. That is\r\nall I can tell you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Tuppence thoughtfully. \u201cThank you very much. But I\u2019m not\r\n_really_ inexperienced, you know. I knew perfectly that she was a bad\r\nlot when I went there--as a matter of fact that\u2019s _why_ I went----\u201d She\r\nbroke off, seeing some bewilderment on the lawyer\u2019s face, and went on:\r\n\u201cI think perhaps I\u2019d better tell you the whole story, Sir James. I\u2019ve a\r\nsort of feeling that you\u2019d know in a minute if I didn\u2019t tell the truth,\r\nand so you might as well know all about it from the beginning. What do\r\nyou think, Julius?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs you\u2019re bent on it, I\u2019d go right ahead with the facts,\u201d replied the\r\nAmerican, who had so far sat in silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, tell me all about it,\u201d said Sir James. \u201cI want to know who Tommy\r\nis.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus encouraged Tuppence plunged into her tale, and the lawyer listened\r\nwith close attention.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery interesting,\u201d he said, when she finished. \u201cA great deal of what\r\nyou tell me, child, is already known to me. I\u2019ve had certain theories\r\nof my own about this Jane Finn. You\u2019ve done extraordinarily well so\r\nfar, but it\u2019s rather too bad of--what do you know him as?--Mr. Carter to\r\npitchfork you two young things into an affair of this kind. By the\r\nway, where did Mr. Hersheimmer come in originally? You didn\u2019t make that\r\nclear?\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius answered for himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Jane\u2019s first cousin,\u201d he explained, returning the lawyer\u2019s keen\r\ngaze.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Sir James,\u201d broke out Tuppence, \u201cwhat do you think has become of\r\nTommy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cH\u2019m.\u201d The lawyer rose, and paced slowly up and down. \u201cWhen you arrived,\r\nyoung lady, I was just packing up my traps. Going to Scotland by the\r\nnight train for a few days\u2019 fishing. But there are different kinds of\r\nfishing. I\u2019ve a good mind to stay, and see if we can\u2019t get on the track\r\nof that young chap.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Tuppence clasped her hands ecstatically.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll the same, as I said before, it\u2019s too bad of--of Carter to set you\r\ntwo babies on a job like this. Now, don\u2019t get offended, Miss--er----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCowley. Prudence Cowley. But my friends call me Tuppence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Miss Tuppence, then, as I\u2019m certainly going to be a friend. Don\u2019t\r\nbe offended because I think you\u2019re young. Youth is a failing only too\r\neasily outgrown. Now, about this young Tommy of yours----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Tuppence clasped her hands.\r\n\r\n\u201cFrankly, things look bad for him. He\u2019s been butting in somewhere where\r\nhe wasn\u2019t wanted. Not a doubt of it. But don\u2019t give up hope.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you really will help us? There, Julius! He didn\u2019t want me to come,\u201d\r\n she added by way of explanation.\r\n\r\n\u201cH\u2019m,\u201d said the lawyer, favouring Julius with another keen glance. \u201cAnd\r\nwhy was that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI reckoned it would be no good worrying you with a petty little\r\nbusiness like this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d He paused a moment. \u201cThis petty little business, as you call\r\nit, bears directly on a very big business, bigger perhaps than either\r\nyou or Miss Tuppence know. If this boy is alive, he may have very\r\nvaluable information to give us. Therefore, we must find him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but how?\u201d cried Tuppence. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to think of everything.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir James smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet there\u2019s one person quite near at hand who in all probability\r\nknows where he is, or at all events where he is likely to be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho is that?\u201d asked Tuppence, puzzled.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Vandemeyer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but she\u2019d never tell us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that is where I come in. I think it quite likely that I shall be\r\nable to make Mrs. Vandemeyer tell me what I want to know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d demanded Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, just by asking her questions,\u201d replied Sir James easily. \u201cThat\u2019s\r\nthe way we do it, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe tapped with his finger on the table, and Tuppence felt again the\r\nintense power that radiated from the man.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd if she won\u2019t tell?\u201d asked Julius suddenly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think she will. I have one or two powerful levers. Still, in that\r\nunlikely event, there is always the possibility of bribery.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure. And that\u2019s where I come in!\u201d cried Julius, bringing his fist down\r\non the table with a bang. \u201cYou can count on me, if necessary, for one\r\nmillion dollars. Yes, sir, one million dollars!\u201d\r\n\r\nSir James sat down and subjected Julius to a long scrutiny.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Hersheimmer,\u201d he said at last, \u201cthat is a very large sum.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess it\u2019ll have to be. These aren\u2019t the kind of folk to offer\r\nsixpence to.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the present rate of exchange it amounts to considerably over two\r\nhundred and fifty thousand pounds.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so. Maybe you think I\u2019m talking through my hat, but I can\r\ndeliver the goods all right, with enough over to spare for your fee.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir James flushed slightly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no question of a fee, Mr. Hersheimmer. I am not a private\r\ndetective.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSorry. I guess I was just a mite hasty, but I\u2019ve been feeling bad about\r\nthis money question. I wanted to offer a big reward for news of Jane\r\nsome days ago, but your crusted institution of Scotland Yard advised me\r\nagainst it. Said it was undesirable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey were probably right,\u201d said Sir James dryly.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s all O.K. about Julius,\u201d put in Tuppence. \u201cHe\u2019s not pulling\r\nyour leg. He\u2019s got simply pots of money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe old man piled it up in style,\u201d explained Julius. \u201cNow, let\u2019s get\r\ndown to it. What\u2019s your idea?\u201d\r\n\r\nSir James considered for a moment or two.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no time to be lost. The sooner we strike the better.\u201d He\r\nturned to Tuppence. \u201cIs Mrs. Vandemeyer dining out to-night, do you\r\nknow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I think so, but she will not be out late. Otherwise, she would\r\nhave taken the latchkey.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood. I will call upon her about ten o\u2019clock. What time are you\r\nsupposed to return?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout nine-thirty or ten, but I could go back earlier.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must not do that on any account. It might arouse suspicion if you\r\ndid not stay out till the usual time. Be back by nine-thirty. I will\r\narrive at ten. Mr. Hersheimmer will wait below in a taxi perhaps.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a new Rolls-Royce car,\u201d said Tuppence with vicarious pride.\r\n\r\n\u201cEven better. If I succeed in obtaining the address from her, we can\r\ngo there at once, taking Mrs. Vandemeyer with us if necessary. You\r\nunderstand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Tuppence rose to her feet with a skip of delight. \u201cOh, I feel so\r\nmuch better!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t build on it too much, Miss Tuppence. Go easy.\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius turned to the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\u201cSay, then. I\u2019ll call for you in the car round about nine-thirty. Is\r\nthat right?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps that will be the best plan. It would be unnecessary to have two\r\ncars waiting about. Now, Miss Tuppence, my advice to you is to go and\r\nhave a good dinner, a _really_ good one, mind. And don\u2019t think ahead\r\nmore than you can help.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe shook hands with them both, and a moment later they were outside.\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t he a duck?\u201d inquired Tuppence ecstatically, as she skipped down\r\nthe steps. \u201cOh, Julius, isn\u2019t he just a duck?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I allow he seems to be the goods all right. And I was wrong about\r\nits being useless to go to him. Say, shall we go right away back to the\r\n_Ritz?_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI must walk a bit, I think. I feel so excited. Drop me in the park,\r\nwill you? Unless you\u2019d like to come too?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to get some petrol,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd send off a cable or\r\ntwo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll meet you at the _Ritz_ at seven. We\u2019ll have to dine\r\nupstairs. I can\u2019t show myself in these glad rags.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure. I\u2019ll get Felix help me choose the menu. He\u2019s some head waiter,\r\nthat. So long.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence walked briskly along towards the Serpentine, first glancing at\r\nher watch. It was nearly six o\u2019clock. She remembered that she had had no\r\ntea, but felt too excited to be conscious of hunger. She walked as\r\nfar as Kensington Gardens and then slowly retraced her steps, feeling\r\ninfinitely better for the fresh air and exercise. It was not so easy to\r\nfollow Sir James\u2019s advice, and put the possible events of the evening\r\nout of her head. As she drew nearer and nearer to Hyde Park corner, the\r\ntemptation to return to South Audley Mansions was almost irresistible.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, she decided, it would do no harm just to go and _look_\r\nat the building. Perhaps, then, she could resign herself to waiting\r\npatiently for ten o\u2019clock.\r\n\r\nSouth Audley Mansions looked exactly the same as usual. What Tuppence\r\nhad expected she hardly knew, but the sight of its red brick stolidity\r\nslightly assuaged the growing and entirely unreasonable uneasiness\r\nthat possessed her. She was just turning away when she heard a piercing\r\nwhistle, and the faithful Albert came running from the building to join\r\nher.\r\n\r\nTuppence frowned. It was no part of the programme to have attention\r\ncalled to her presence in the neighbourhood, but Albert was purple with\r\nsuppressed excitement.\r\n\r\n\u201cI say, miss, she\u2019s a-going!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s going?\u201d demanded Tuppence sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe crook. Ready Rita. Mrs. Vandemeyer. She\u2019s a-packing up, and she\u2019s\r\njust sent down word for me to get her a taxi.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tuppence clutched his arm.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the truth, miss. I thought maybe as you didn\u2019t know about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlbert,\u201d cried Tuppence, \u201cyou\u2019re a brick. If it hadn\u2019t been for you\r\nwe\u2019d have lost her.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlbert flushed with pleasure at this tribute.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no time to lose,\u201d said Tuppence, crossing the road. \u201cI\u2019ve got\r\nto stop her. At all costs I must keep her here until----\u201d She broke off.\r\n\u201cAlbert, there\u2019s a telephone here, isn\u2019t there?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boy shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe flats mostly have their own, miss. But there\u2019s a box just round the\r\ncorner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo to it then, at once, and ring up the _Ritz Hotel_. Ask for Mr.\r\nHersheimmer, and when you get him tell him to get Sir James and come on\r\nat once, as Mrs. Vandemeyer is trying to hook it. If you can\u2019t get him,\r\nring up Sir James Peel Edgerton, you\u2019ll find his number in the book, and\r\ntell him what\u2019s happening. You won\u2019t forget the names, will you?\u201d\r\n\r\nAlbert repeated them glibly. \u201cYou trust to me, miss, it\u2019ll be all right.\r\nBut what about you? Aren\u2019t you afraid to trust yourself with her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, that\u2019s all right. _But go and telephone_. Be quick.\u201d\r\n\r\nDrawing a long breath, Tuppence entered the Mansions and ran up to the\r\ndoor of No. 20. How she was to detain Mrs. Vandemeyer until the two men\r\narrived, she did not know, but somehow or other it had to be done, and\r\nshe must accomplish the task single-handed. What had occasioned this\r\nprecipitate departure? Did Mrs. Vandemeyer suspect her?\r\n\r\nSpeculations were idle. Tuppence pressed the bell firmly. She might\r\nlearn something from the cook.\r\n\r\nNothing happened and, after waiting some minutes, Tuppence pressed the\r\nbell again, keeping her finger on the button for some little while.\r\nAt last she heard footsteps inside, and a moment later Mrs. Vandemeyer\r\nherself opened the door. She lifted her eyebrows at the sight of the\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI had a touch of toothache, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Tuppence glibly. \u201cSo thought\r\nit better to come home and have a quiet evening.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer said nothing, but she drew back and let Tuppence pass\r\ninto the hall.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow unfortunate for you,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cYou had better go to bed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I shall be all right in the kitchen, ma\u2019am. Cook will----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCook is out,\u201d said Mrs. Vandemeyer, in a rather disagreeable tone. \u201cI\r\nsent her out. So you see you had better go to bed.\u201d\r\n\r\nSuddenly Tuppence felt afraid. There was a ring in Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s\r\nvoice that she did not like at all. Also, the other woman was slowly\r\nedging her up the passage. Tuppence turned at bay.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want----\u201d\r\n\r\nThen, in a flash, a rim of cold steel touched her temple, and Mrs.\r\nVandemeyer\u2019s voice rose cold and menacing:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou damned little fool! Do you think I don\u2019t know? No, don\u2019t answer. If\r\nyou struggle or cry out, I\u2019ll shoot you like a dog.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe rim of steel pressed a little harder against the girl\u2019s temple.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow then, march,\u201d went on Mrs. Vandemeyer. \u201cThis way--into my room. In\r\na minute, when I\u2019ve done with you, you\u2019ll go to bed as I told you to.\r\nAnd you\u2019ll sleep--oh yes, my little spy, you\u2019ll sleep all right!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a sort of hideous geniality in the last words which Tuppence\r\ndid not at all like. For the moment there was nothing to be done, and\r\nshe walked obediently into Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s bedroom. The pistol never\r\nleft her forehead. The room was in a state of wild disorder, clothes\r\nwere flung about right and left, a suit-case and a hat box, half-packed,\r\nstood in the middle of the floor.\r\n\r\nTuppence pulled herself together with an effort. Her voice shook a\r\nlittle, but she spoke out bravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome now,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is nonsense. You can\u2019t shoot me. Why, every\r\none in the building would hear the report.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d risk that,\u201d said Mrs. Vandemeyer cheerfully. \u201cBut, as long as you\r\ndon\u2019t sing out for help, you\u2019re all right--and I don\u2019t think you will.\r\nYou\u2019re a clever girl. You deceived _me_ all right. I hadn\u2019t a suspicion\r\nof you! So I\u2019ve no doubt that you understand perfectly well that this\r\nis where I\u2019m on top and you\u2019re underneath. Now then--sit on the bed. Put\r\nyour hands above your head, and if you value your life don\u2019t move them.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence obeyed passively. Her good sense told her that there was\r\nnothing else to do but accept the situation. If she shrieked for help\r\nthere was very little chance of anyone hearing her, whereas there was\r\nprobably quite a good chance of Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s shooting her. In the\r\nmeantime, every minute of delay gained was valuable.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer laid down the revolver on the edge of the washstand\r\nwithin reach of her hand, and, still eyeing Tuppence like a lynx in case\r\nthe girl should attempt to move, she took a little stoppered bottle from\r\nits place on the marble and poured some of its contents into a glass\r\nwhich she filled up with water.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d asked Tuppence sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cSomething to make you sleep soundly.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence paled a little.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you going to poison me?\u201d she asked in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d said Mrs. Vandemeyer, smiling agreeably.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I shan\u2019t drink it,\u201d said Tuppence firmly. \u201cI\u2019d much rather be\r\nshot. At any rate that would make a row, and some one might hear it. But\r\nI won\u2019t be killed off quietly like a lamb.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer stamped her foot.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a little fool! Do you really think I want a hue and cry for\r\nmurder out after me? If you\u2019ve any sense at all, you\u2019ll realize that\r\npoisoning you wouldn\u2019t suit my book at all. It\u2019s a sleeping draught,\r\nthat\u2019s all. You\u2019ll wake up to-morrow morning none the worse. I simply\r\ndon\u2019t want the bother of tying you up and gagging you. That\u2019s the\r\nalternative--and you won\u2019t like it, I can tell you! I can be very rough\r\nif I choose. So drink this down like a good girl, and you\u2019ll be none the\r\nworse for it.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn her heart of hearts Tuppence believed her. The arguments she had\r\nadduced rang true. It was a simple and effective method of getting her\r\nout of the way for the time being. Nevertheless, the girl did not take\r\nkindly to the idea of being tamely put to sleep without as much as one\r\nbid for freedom. She felt that once Mrs. Vandemeyer gave them the slip,\r\nthe last hope of finding Tommy would be gone.\r\n\r\nTuppence was quick in her mental processes. All these reflections\r\npassed through her mind in a flash, and she saw where a chance, a very\r\nproblematical chance, lay, and she determined to risk all in one supreme\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, she lurched suddenly off the bed and fell on her knees\r\nbefore Mrs. Vandemeyer, clutching her skirts frantically.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d she moaned. \u201cIt\u2019s poison--I know it\u2019s poison.\r\nOh, don\u2019t make me drink it\u201d--her voice rose to a shriek--\u201cdon\u2019t make me\r\ndrink it!\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer, glass in hand, looked down with a curling lip at this\r\nsudden collapse.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet up, you little idiot! Don\u2019t go on drivelling there. How you ever\r\nhad the nerve to play your part as you did I can\u2019t think.\u201d She stamped\r\nher foot. \u201cGet up, I say.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Tuppence continued to cling and sob, interjecting her sobs with\r\nincoherent appeals for mercy. Every minute gained was to the good.\r\nMoreover, as she grovelled, she moved imperceptibly nearer to her\r\nobjective.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer gave a sharp impatient exclamation, and jerked the girl\r\nto her knees.\r\n\r\n\u201cDrink it at once!\u201d Imperiously she pressed the glass to the girl\u2019s\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nTuppence gave one last despairing moan.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou swear it won\u2019t hurt me?\u201d she temporized.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course it won\u2019t hurt you. Don\u2019t be a fool.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you swear it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d said the other impatiently. \u201cI swear it.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence raised a trembling left hand to the glass.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d Her mouth opened meekly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer gave a sigh of relief, off her guard for the moment.\r\nThen, quick as a flash, Tuppence jerked the glass upward as hard as she\r\ncould. The fluid in it splashed into Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s face, and during\r\nher momentary gasp, Tuppence\u2019s right hand shot out and grasped the\r\nrevolver where it lay on the edge of the washstand. The next moment\r\nshe had sprung back a pace, and the revolver pointed straight at Mrs.\r\nVandemeyer\u2019s heart, with no unsteadiness in the hand that held it.\r\n\r\nIn the moment of victory, Tuppence betrayed a somewhat unsportsmanlike\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow who\u2019s on top and who\u2019s underneath?\u201d she crowed.\r\n\r\nThe other\u2019s face was convulsed with rage. For a minute Tuppence thought\r\nshe was going to spring upon her, which would have placed the girl in an\r\nunpleasant dilemma, since she meant to draw the line at actually letting\r\noff the revolver. However, with an effort Mrs. Vandemeyer controlled\r\nherself, and at last a slow evil smile crept over her face.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a fool, then, after all! You did that well, girl. But you shall pay\r\nfor it--oh, yes, you shall pay for it! I have a long memory!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised you should have been gulled so easily,\u201d said Tuppence\r\nscornfully. \u201cDid you really think I was the kind of girl to roll about\r\non the floor and whine for mercy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may do--some day!\u201d said the other significantly.\r\n\r\nThe cold malignity of her manner sent an unpleasant chill down\r\nTuppence\u2019s spine, but she was not going to give in to it.\r\n\r\n\u201cSupposing we sit down,\u201d she said pleasantly. \u201cOur present attitude is\r\na little melodramatic. No--not on the bed. Draw a chair up to the table,\r\nthat\u2019s right. Now I\u2019ll sit opposite you with the revolver in front of\r\nme--just in case of accidents. Splendid. Now, let\u2019s talk.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about?\u201d said Mrs. Vandemeyer sullenly.\r\n\r\nTuppence eyed her thoughtfully for a minute. She was remembering several\r\nthings. Boris\u2019s words, \u201cI believe you would sell-- _us!_\u201d and her\r\nanswer, \u201cThe price would have to be enormous,\u201d given lightly, it was\r\ntrue, yet might not there be a substratum of truth in it? Long ago,\r\nhad not Whittington asked: \u201cWho\u2019s been blabbing? Rita?\u201d Would Rita\r\nVandemeyer prove to be the weak spot in the armour of Mr. Brown?\r\n\r\nKeeping her eyes fixed steadily on the other\u2019s face, Tuppence replied\r\nquietly:\r\n\r\n\u201cMoney----\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer started. Clearly, the reply was unexpected.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you. You said just now that you had a long memory. A long\r\nmemory isn\u2019t half as useful as a long purse! I dare say it relieves your\r\nfeelings a good deal to plan out all sorts of dreadful things to do to\r\nme, but is that _practical?_ Revenge is very unsatisfactory. Every one\r\nalways says so. But money\u201d--Tuppence warmed to her pet creed--\u201cwell,\r\nthere\u2019s nothing unsatisfactory about money, is there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you think,\u201d said Mrs. Vandemeyer scornfully, \u201cthat I am the kind of\r\nwoman to sell my friends?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Tuppence promptly. \u201cIf the price was big enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA paltry hundred pounds or so!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Tuppence. \u201cI should suggest--a hundred thousand!\u201d\r\n\r\nHer economical spirit did not permit her to mention the whole million\r\ndollars suggested by Julius.\r\n\r\nA flush crept over Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d she asked, her fingers playing nervously with a\r\nbrooch on her breast. In that moment Tuppence knew that the fish was\r\nhooked, and for the first time she felt a horror of her own money-loving\r\nspirit. It gave her a dreadful sense of kinship to the woman fronting\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\u201cA hundred thousand pounds,\u201d repeated Tuppence.\r\n\r\nThe light died out of Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s eyes. She leaned back in her\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\u201cBah!\u201d she said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t got it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d admitted Tuppence, \u201cI haven\u2019t--but I know some one who has.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA friend of mine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMust be a millionaire,\u201d remarked Mrs. Vandemeyer unbelievingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs a matter of fact he is. He\u2019s an American. He\u2019ll pay you that\r\nwithout a murmur. You can take it from me that it\u2019s a perfectly genuine\r\nproposition.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer sat up again.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m inclined to believe you,\u201d she said slowly.\r\n\r\nThere was silence between them for some time, then Mrs. Vandemeyer\r\nlooked up.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat does he want to know, this friend of yours?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence went through a momentary struggle, but it was Julius\u2019s money,\r\nand his interests must come first.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe wants to know where Jane Finn is,\u201d she said boldly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer showed no surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure where she is at the present moment,\u201d she replied.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you could find out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d returned Mrs. Vandemeyer carelessly. \u201cThere would be no\r\ndifficulty about that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen\u201d--Tuppence\u2019s voice shook a little--\u201cthere\u2019s a boy, a friend of\r\nmine. I\u2019m afraid something\u2019s happened to him, through your pal Boris.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTommy Beresford.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever heard of him. But I\u2019ll ask Boris. He\u2019ll tell me anything he\r\nknows.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Tuppence felt a terrific rise in her spirits. It impelled\r\nher to more audacious efforts. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence leaned forward and lowered her voice.\r\n\r\n_\u201cWho is Mr. Brown?\u201d_\r\n\r\nHer quick eyes saw the sudden paling of the beautiful face. With an\r\neffort Mrs. Vandemeyer pulled herself together and tried to resume her\r\nformer manner. But the attempt was a mere parody.\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have learnt much about us if you don\u2019t know that _nobody\r\nknows who Mr. Brown is_....\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do,\u201d said Tuppence quietly.\r\n\r\nAgain the colour deserted the other\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said the girl truthfully. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer stared in front of her for a long time.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said hoarsely, at last, \u201c_I_ know. I was beautiful, you\r\nsee--very beautiful----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are still,\u201d said Tuppence with admiration.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer shook her head. There was a strange gleam in her\r\nelectric-blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot beautiful enough,\u201d she said in a soft dangerous voice.\r\n\u201cNot--beautiful--enough! And sometimes, lately, I\u2019ve been afraid....\r\nIt\u2019s dangerous to know too much!\u201d She leaned forward across the table.\r\n\u201cSwear that my name shan\u2019t be brought into it--that no one shall ever\r\nknow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI swear it. And, once\u2019s he caught, you\u2019ll be out of danger.\u201d\r\n\r\nA terrified look swept across Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n\u201cShall I? Shall I ever be?\u201d She clutched Tuppence\u2019s arm. \u201cYou\u2019re sure\r\nabout the money?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen shall I have it? There must be no delay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis friend of mine will be here presently. He may have to send cables,\r\nor something like that. But there won\u2019t be any delay--he\u2019s a terrific\r\nhustler.\u201d\r\n\r\nA resolute look settled on Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it. It\u2019s a great sum of money, and besides\u201d--she gave a curious\r\nsmile--\u201cit is not--wise to throw over a woman like me!\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment or two, she remained smiling, and lightly tapping her\r\nfingers on the table. Suddenly she started, and her face blanched.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI heard nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer gazed round her fearfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf there should be some one listening----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNonsense. Who could there be?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEven the walls might have ears,\u201d whispered the other. \u201cI tell you I\u2019m\r\nfrightened. You don\u2019t know him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThink of the hundred thousand pounds,\u201d said Tuppence soothingly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer passed her tongue over her dried lips.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know him,\u201d she reiterated hoarsely. \u201cHe\u2019s--ah!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a shriek of terror she sprang to her feet. Her outstretched hand\r\npointed over Tuppence\u2019s head. Then she swayed to the ground in a dead\r\nfaint.\r\n\r\nTuppence looked round to see what had startled her.\r\n\r\nIn the doorway were Sir James Peel Edgerton and Julius Hersheimmer.\r\n\nSIR James brushed past Julius and hurriedly bent over the fallen woman.\r\n\r\n\u201cHeart,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cSeeing us so suddenly must have given her a\r\nshock. Brandy--and quickly, or she\u2019ll slip through our fingers.\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius hurried to the washstand.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot there,\u201d said Tuppence over her shoulder. \u201cIn the tantalus in the\r\ndining-room. Second door down the passage.\u201d\r\n\r\nBetween them Sir James and Tuppence lifted Mrs. Vandemeyer and carried\r\nher to the bed. There they dashed water on her face, but with no result.\r\nThe lawyer fingered her pulse.\r\n\r\n\u201cTouch and go,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI wish that young fellow would hurry up\r\nwith the brandy.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt that moment Julius re-entered the room, carrying a glass half full of\r\nthe spirit which he handed to Sir James. While Tuppence lifted her head\r\nthe lawyer tried to force a little of the spirit between her closed\r\nlips. Finally the woman opened her eyes feebly. Tuppence held the glass\r\nto her lips.\r\n\r\n\u201cDrink this.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer complied. The brandy brought the colour back to her\r\nwhite cheeks, and revived her in a marvellous fashion. She tried to sit\r\nup--then fell back with a groan, her hand to her side.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s my heart,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI mustn\u2019t talk.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe lay back with closed eyes.\r\n\r\nSir James kept his finger on her wrist a minute longer, then withdrew it\r\nwith a nod.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll do now.\u201d\r\n\r\nAll three moved away, and stood together talking in low voices. One\r\nand all were conscious of a certain feeling of anticlimax. Clearly any\r\nscheme for cross-questioning the lady was out of the question for the\r\nmoment. For the time being they were baffled, and could do nothing.\r\n\r\nTuppence related how Mrs. Vandemeyer had declared herself willing\r\nto disclose the identity of Mr. Brown, and how she had consented to\r\ndiscover and reveal to them the whereabouts of Jane Finn. Julius was\r\ncongratulatory.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right, Miss Tuppence. Splendid! I guess that hundred\r\nthousand pounds will look just as good in the morning to the lady as it\r\ndid over night. There\u2019s nothing to worry over. She won\u2019t speak without\r\nthe cash anyway, you bet!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was certainly a good deal of common sense in this, and Tuppence\r\nfelt a little comforted.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat you say is true,\u201d said Sir James meditatively. \u201cI must confess,\r\nhowever, that I cannot help wishing we had not interrupted at the minute\r\nwe did. Still, it cannot be helped, it is only a matter of waiting until\r\nthe morning.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked across at the inert figure on the bed. Mrs. Vandemeyer lay\r\nperfectly passive with closed eyes. He shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Tuppence, with an attempt at cheerfulness, \u201cwe must wait\r\nuntil the morning, that\u2019s all. But I don\u2019t think we ought to leave the\r\nflat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about leaving that bright boy of yours on guard?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlbert? And suppose she came round again and hooked it. Albert couldn\u2019t\r\nstop her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess she won\u2019t want to make tracks away from the dollars.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe might. She seemed very frightened of \u2018Mr. Brown.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat? Real plumb scared of him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. She looked round and said even walls had ears.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe she meant a dictaphone,\u201d said Julius with interest.\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Tuppence is right,\u201d said Sir James quietly. \u201cWe must not leave the\r\nflat--if only for Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s sake.\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius stared at him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think he\u2019d get after her? Between now and to-morrow morning. How\r\ncould he know, even?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou forget your own suggestion of a dictaphone,\u201d said Sir James dryly.\r\n\u201cWe have a very formidable adversary. I believe, if we exercise all due\r\ncare, that there is a very good chance of his being delivered into our\r\nhands. But we must neglect no precaution. We have an important witness,\r\nbut she must be safeguarded. I would suggest that Miss Tuppence should\r\ngo to bed, and that you and I, Mr. Hersheimmer, should share the vigil.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence was about to protest, but happening to glance at the bed she\r\nsaw Mrs. Vandemeyer, her eyes half-open, with such an expression of\r\nmingled fear and malevolence on her face that it quite froze the words\r\non her lips.\r\n\r\nFor a moment she wondered whether the faint and the heart attack had\r\nbeen a gigantic sham, but remembering the deadly pallor she could hardly\r\ncredit the supposition. As she looked the expression disappeared as by\r\nmagic, and Mrs. Vandemeyer lay inert and motionless as before. For a\r\nmoment the girl fancied she must have dreamt it. But she determined\r\nnevertheless to be on the alert.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Julius, \u201cI guess we\u2019d better make a move out of here any\r\nway.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe others fell in with his suggestion. Sir James again felt Mrs.\r\nVandemeyer\u2019s pulse.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerfectly satisfactory,\u201d he said in a low voice to Tuppence. \u201cShe\u2019ll be\r\nabsolutely all right after a night\u2019s rest.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl hesitated a moment by the bed. The intensity of the expression\r\nshe had surprised had impressed her powerfully. Mrs. Vandemeyer lifted\r\nher lids. She seemed to be struggling to speak. Tuppence bent over her.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t--leave----\u201d she seemed unable to proceed, murmuring something\r\nthat sounded like \u201csleepy.\u201d Then she tried again.\r\n\r\nTuppence bent lower still. It was only a breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr.--Brown----\u201d The voice stopped.\r\n\r\nBut the half-closed eyes seemed still to send an agonized message.\r\n\r\nMoved by a sudden impulse, the girl said quickly:\r\n\r\n\u201cI shan\u2019t leave the flat. I shall sit up all night.\u201d\r\n\r\nA flash of relief showed before the lids descended once more. Apparently\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer slept. But her words had awakened a new uneasiness in\r\nTuppence. What had she meant by that low murmur: \u201cMr. Brown?\u201d Tuppence\r\ncaught herself nervously looking over her shoulder. The big wardrobe\r\nloomed up in a sinister fashion before her eyes. Plenty of room for a\r\nman to hide in that.... Half-ashamed of herself, Tuppence pulled it open\r\nand looked inside. No one--of course! She stooped down and looked under\r\nthe bed. There was no other possible hiding-place.\r\n\r\nTuppence gave her familiar shake of the shoulders. It was absurd, this\r\ngiving way to nerves! Slowly she went out of the room. Julius and Sir\r\nJames were talking in a low voice. Sir James turned to her.\r\n\r\n\u201cLock the door on the outside, please, Miss Tuppence, and take out the\r\nkey. There must be no chance of anyone entering that room.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe gravity of his manner impressed them, and Tuppence felt less ashamed\r\nof her attack of \u201cnerves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSay,\u201d remarked Julius suddenly, \u201cthere\u2019s Tuppence\u2019s bright boy. I guess\r\nI\u2019d better go down and ease his young mind. That\u2019s some lad, Tuppence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you get in, by the way?\u201d asked Tuppence suddenly. \u201cI forgot to\r\nask.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Albert got me on the phone all right. I ran round for Sir James\r\nhere, and we came right on. The boy was on the look out for us, and was\r\njust a mite worried about what might have happened to you. He\u2019d been\r\nlistening outside the door of the flat, but couldn\u2019t hear anything.\r\nAnyhow he suggested sending us up in the coal lift instead of ringing\r\nthe bell. And sure enough we landed in the scullery and came right along\r\nto find you. Albert\u2019s still below, and must be just hopping mad by this\r\ntime.\u201d With which Julius departed abruptly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow then, Miss Tuppence,\u201d said Sir James, \u201cyou know this place better\r\nthan I do. Where do you suggest we should take up our quarters?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence considered for a moment or two.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s boudoir would be the most comfortable,\u201d she\r\nsaid at last, and led the way there.\r\n\r\nSir James looked round approvingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis will do very well, and now, my dear young lady, do go to bed and\r\nget some sleep.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence shook her head resolutely.\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t, thank you, Sir James. I should dream of Mr. Brown all\r\nnight!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you\u2019ll be so tired, child.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I shan\u2019t. I\u2019d rather stay up--really.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe lawyer gave in.\r\n\r\nJulius reappeared some minutes later, having reassured Albert and\r\nrewarded him lavishly for his services. Having in his turn failed to\r\npersuade Tuppence to go to bed, he said decisively:\r\n\r\n\u201cAt any rate, you\u2019ve got to have something to eat right away. Where\u2019s\r\nthe larder?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence directed him, and he returned in a few minutes with a cold pie\r\nand three plates.\r\n\r\nAfter a hearty meal, the girl felt inclined to pooh-pooh her fancies of\r\nhalf an hour before. The power of the money bribe could not fail.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now, Miss Tuppence,\u201d said Sir James, \u201cwe want to hear your\r\nadventures.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d agreed Julius.\r\n\r\nTuppence narrated her adventures with some complacence. Julius\r\noccasionally interjected an admiring \u201cBully.\u201d Sir James said nothing\r\nuntil she had finished, when his quiet \u201cwell done, Miss Tuppence,\u201d made\r\nher flush with pleasure.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t get clearly,\u201d said Julius. \u201cWhat put her up\r\nto clearing out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d confessed Tuppence.\r\n\r\nSir James stroked his chin thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe room was in great disorder. That looks as though her flight was\r\nunpremeditated. Almost as though she got a sudden warning to go from\r\nsome one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Brown, I suppose,\u201d said Julius scoffingly.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer looked at him deliberately for a minute or two.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d he said. \u201cRemember, you yourself have once been worsted by\r\nhim.\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius flushed with vexation.\r\n\r\n\u201cI feel just mad when I think of how I handed out Jane\u2019s photograph to\r\nhim like a lamb. Gee, if I ever lay hands on it again, I\u2019ll freeze on to\r\nit like--like hell!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat contingency is likely to be a remote one,\u201d said the other dryly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re right,\u201d said Julius frankly. \u201cAnd, in any case, it\u2019s the\r\noriginal I\u2019m out after. Where do you think she can be, Sir James?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe lawyer shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cImpossible to say. But I\u2019ve a very good idea where she _has_ been.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have? Where?\u201d\r\n\r\nSir James smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the scene of your nocturnal adventures, the Bournemouth nursing\r\nhome.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere? Impossible. I asked.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, my dear sir, you asked if anyone of the name of Jane Finn had been\r\nthere. Now, if the girl had been placed there it would almost certainly\r\nbe under an assumed name.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBully for you,\u201d cried Julius. \u201cI never thought of that!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was fairly obvious,\u201d said the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps the doctor\u2019s in it too,\u201d suggested Tuppence.\r\n\r\nJulius shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I took to him at once. No, I\u2019m pretty sure Dr. Hall\u2019s\r\nall right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHall, did you say?\u201d asked Sir James. \u201cThat is curious--really very\r\ncurious.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d demanded Tuppence.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause I happened to meet him this morning. I\u2019ve known him slightly on\r\nand off for some years, and this morning I ran across him in the street.\r\nStaying at the _M\u00e9tropole_, he told me.\u201d He turned to Julius. \u201cDidn\u2019t\r\nhe tell you he was coming up to town?\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cCurious,\u201d mused Sir James. \u201cYou did not mention his name this\r\nafternoon, or I would have suggested your going to him for further\r\ninformation with my card as introduction.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m a mutt,\u201d said Julius with unusual humility. \u201cI ought to\r\nhave thought of the false name stunt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow could you think of anything after falling out of that tree?\u201d cried\r\nTuppence. \u201cI\u2019m sure anyone else would have been killed right off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I guess it doesn\u2019t matter now, anyway,\u201d said Julius. \u201cWe\u2019ve got\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer on a string, and that\u2019s all we need.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Tuppence, but there was a lack of assurance in her voice.\r\n\r\nA silence settled down over the party. Little by little the magic of\r\nthe night began to gain a hold on them. There were sudden creaks of the\r\nfurniture, imperceptible rustlings in the curtains. Suddenly Tuppence\r\nsprang up with a cry.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I know Mr. Brown\u2019s somewhere in the flat! I can _feel_\r\nhim.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure, Tuppence, how could he be? This door\u2019s open into the hall. No\r\none could have come in by the front door without our seeing and hearing\r\nhim.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I _feel_ he\u2019s here!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe looked appealingly at Sir James, who replied gravely:\r\n\r\n\u201cWith due deference to your feelings, Miss Tuppence (and mine as well\r\nfor that matter), I do not see how it is humanly possible for anyone to\r\nbe in the flat without our knowledge.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl was a little comforted by his words.\r\n\r\n\u201cSitting up at night is always rather jumpy,\u201d she confessed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Sir James. \u201cWe are in the condition of people holding a\r\ns\u00e9ance. Perhaps if a medium were present we might get some marvellous\r\nresults.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you believe in spiritualism?\u201d asked Tuppence, opening her eyes wide.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is some truth in it, without a doubt. But most of the testimony\r\nwould not pass muster in the witness-box.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe hours drew on. With the first faint glimmerings of dawn, Sir James\r\ndrew aside the curtains. They beheld, what few Londoners see, the slow\r\nrising of the sun over the sleeping city. Somehow, with the coming\r\nof the light, the dreads and fancies of the past night seemed absurd.\r\nTuppence\u2019s spirits revived to the normal.\r\n\r\n\u201cHooray!\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a gorgeous day. And we shall find\r\nTommy. And Jane Finn. And everything will be lovely. I shall ask Mr.\r\nCarter if I can\u2019t be made a Dame!\u201d\r\n\r\nAt seven o\u2019clock Tuppence volunteered to go and make some tea. She\r\nreturned with a tray, containing the teapot and four cups.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s the other cup for?\u201d inquired Julius.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe prisoner, of course. I suppose we might call her that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTaking her tea seems a kind of anticlimax to last night,\u201d said Julius\r\nthoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, it does,\u201d admitted Tuppence. \u201cBut, anyway, here goes. Perhaps\r\nyou\u2019d both come, too, in case she springs on me, or anything. You see,\r\nwe don\u2019t know what mood she\u2019ll wake up in.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir James and Julius accompanied her to the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the key? Oh, of course, I\u2019ve got it myself.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe put it in the lock, and turned it, then paused.\r\n\r\n\u201cSupposing, after all, she\u2019s escaped?\u201d she murmured in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlumb impossible,\u201d replied Julius reassuringly.\r\n\r\nBut Sir James said nothing.\r\n\r\nTuppence drew a long breath and entered. She heaved a sigh of relief as\r\nshe saw that Mrs. Vandemeyer was lying on the bed.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d she remarked cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019ve brought you some tea.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer did not reply. Tuppence put down the cup on the table\r\nby the bed and went across to draw up the blinds. When she turned, Mrs.\r\nVandemeyer still lay without a movement. With a sudden fear clutching\r\nat her heart, Tuppence ran to the bed. The hand she lifted was cold as\r\nice.... Mrs. Vandemeyer would never speak now....\r\n\r\nHer cry brought the others. A very few minutes sufficed. Mrs. Vandemeyer\r\nwas dead--must have been dead some hours. She had evidently died in her\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf that isn\u2019t the cruellest luck,\u201d cried Julius in despair.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer was calmer, but there was a curious gleam in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf it is luck,\u201d he replied.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think--but, say, that\u2019s plumb impossible--no one could have\r\ngot in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d admitted the lawyer. \u201cI don\u2019t see how they could. And yet--she is\r\non the point of betraying Mr. Brown, and--she dies. Is it only chance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, _how!_ That is what we must find out.\u201d He stood there silently,\r\ngently stroking his chin. \u201cWe must find out,\u201d he said quietly, and\r\nTuppence felt that if she was Mr. Brown she would not like the tone of\r\nthose simple words.\r\n\r\nJulius\u2019s glance went to the window.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe window\u2019s open,\u201d he remarked. \u201cDo you think----\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe balcony only goes along as far as the boudoir. We were there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe might have slipped out----\u201d suggested Julius.\r\n\r\nBut Sir James interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Brown\u2019s methods are not so crude. In the meantime we must send for\r\na doctor, but before we do so, is there anything in this room that might\r\nbe of value to us?\u201d\r\n\r\nHastily, the three searched. A charred mass in the grate indicated\r\nthat Mrs. Vandemeyer had been burning papers on the eve of her flight.\r\nNothing of importance remained, though they searched the other rooms as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s that,\u201d said Tuppence suddenly, pointing to a small,\r\nold-fashioned safe let into the wall. \u201cIt\u2019s for jewellery, I believe,\r\nbut there might be something else in it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe key was in the lock, and Julius swung open the door, and searched\r\ninside. He was some time over the task.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Tuppence impatiently.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause before Julius answered, then he withdrew his head and\r\nshut to the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nIn five minutes a brisk young doctor arrived, hastily summoned. He was\r\ndeferential to Sir James, whom he recognized.\r\n\r\n\u201cHeart failure, or possibly an overdose of some sleeping-draught.\u201d He\r\nsniffed. \u201cRather an odour of chloral in the air.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence remembered the glass she had upset. A new thought drove her to\r\nthe washstand. She found the little bottle from which Mrs. Vandemeyer\r\nhad poured a few drops.\r\n\r\nIt had been three parts full. Now-- _it was empty_.\r\n\nNOTHING was more surprising and bewildering to Tuppence than the ease\r\nand simplicity with which everything was arranged, owing to Sir James\u2019s\r\nskilful handling. The doctor accepted quite readily the theory that Mrs.\r\nVandemeyer had accidentally taken an overdose of chloral. He doubted\r\nwhether an inquest would be necessary. If so, he would let Sir James\r\nknow. He understood that Mrs. Vandemeyer was on the eve of departure for\r\nabroad, and that the servants had already left? Sir James and his young\r\nfriends had been paying a call upon her, when she was suddenly stricken\r\ndown and they had spent the night in the flat, not liking to leave\r\nher alone. Did they know of any relatives? They did not, but Sir James\r\nreferred him to Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s solicitor.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards a nurse arrived to take charge, and the other left\r\nthe ill-omened building.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what now?\u201d asked Julius, with a gesture of despair. \u201cI guess we\u2019re\r\ndown and out for good.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir James stroked his chin thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThere is still the chance that Dr. Hall may be\r\nable to tell us something.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGee! I\u2019d forgotten him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe chance is slight, but it must not be neglected. I think I told you\r\nthat he is staying at the _M\u00e9tropole_. I should suggest that we call\r\nupon him there as soon as possible. Shall we say after a bath and\r\nbreakfast?\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that Tuppence and Julius should return to the _Ritz_,\r\nand call for Sir James in the car. This programme was faithfully carried\r\nout, and a little after eleven they drew up before the _M\u00e9tropole_.\r\nThey asked for Dr. Hall, and a page-boy went in search of him. In a few\r\nminutes the little doctor came hurrying towards them.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you spare us a few minutes, Dr. Hall?\u201d said Sir James pleasantly.\r\n\u201cLet me introduce you to Miss Cowley. Mr. Hersheimmer, I think, you\r\nalready know.\u201d\r\n\r\nA quizzical gleam came into the doctor\u2019s eye as he shook hands with\r\nJulius.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes, my young friend of the tree episode! Ankle all right, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s cured owing to your skilful treatment, doc.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the heart trouble? Ha ha!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStill searching,\u201d said Julius briefly.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo come to the point, can we have a word with you in private?\u201d asked\r\nSir James.\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. I think there is a room here where we shall be quite\r\nundisturbed.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe led the way, and the others followed him. They sat down, and the\r\ndoctor looked inquiringly at Sir James.\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Hall, I am very anxious to find a certain young lady for the\r\npurpose of obtaining a statement from her. I have reason to believe\r\nthat she has been at one time or another in your establishment at\r\nBournemouth. I hope I am transgressing no professional etiquette in\r\nquestioning you on the subject?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose it is a matter of testimony?\u201d\r\n\r\nSir James hesitated a moment, then he replied:\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall be pleased to give you any information in my power. What is\r\nthe young lady\u2019s name? Mr. Hersheimmer asked me, I remember----\u201d He half\r\nturned to Julius.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe name,\u201d said Sir James bluntly, \u201cis really immaterial. She would be\r\nalmost certainly sent to you under an assumed one. But I should like to\r\nknow if you are acquainted with a Mrs. Vandemeyer?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Vandemeyer, of 20 South Audley Mansions? I know her slightly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are not aware of what has happened?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do not know that Mrs. Vandemeyer is dead?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear, dear, I had no idea of it! When did it happen?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe took an overdose of chloral last night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPurposely?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAccidentally, it is believed. I should not like to say myself. Anyway,\r\nshe was found dead this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery sad. A singularly handsome woman. I presume she was a friend of\r\nyours, since you are acquainted with all these details.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am acquainted with the details because--well, it was I who found her\r\ndead.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said the doctor, starting.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Sir James, and stroked his chin reflectively.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is very sad news, but you will excuse me if I say that I do not\r\nsee how it bears on the subject of your inquiry?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt bears on it in this way, is it not a fact that Mrs. Vandemeyer\r\ncommitted a young relative of hers to your charge?\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius leaned forward eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is the case,\u201d said the doctor quietly.\r\n\r\n\u201cUnder the name of----?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJanet Vandemeyer. I understood her to be a niece of Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd she came to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs far as I can remember in June or July of 1915.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas she a mental case?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe is perfectly sane, if that is what you mean. I understood from Mrs.\r\nVandemeyer that the girl had been with her on the _Lusitania_ when\r\nthat ill-fated ship was sunk, and had suffered a severe shock in\r\nconsequence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the right track, I think?\u201d Sir James looked round.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I said before, I\u2019m a mutt!\u201d returned Julius.\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked at them all curiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou spoke of wanting a statement from her,\u201d he said. \u201cSupposing she is\r\nnot able to give one?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat? You have just said that she is perfectly sane.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo she is. Nevertheless, if you want a statement from her concerning\r\nany events prior to May 7, 1915, she will not be able to give it to\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey looked at the little man, stupefied. He nodded cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pity,\u201d he said. \u201cA great pity, especially as I gather, Sir\r\nJames, that the matter is important. But there it is, she can tell you\r\nnothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why, man? Darn it all, why?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe little man shifted his benevolent glance to the excited young\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause Janet Vandemeyer is suffering from a complete loss of memory.\u201d\r\n\r\n_\u201cWhat?\u201d_\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. An interesting case, a _very_ interesting case. Not so\r\nuncommon, really, as you would think. There are several very well known\r\nparallels. It\u2019s the first case of the kind that I\u2019ve had under my own\r\npersonal observation, and I must admit that I\u2019ve found it of absorbing\r\ninterest.\u201d There was something rather ghoulish in the little man\u2019s\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd she remembers nothing,\u201d said Sir James slowly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing prior to May 7, 1915. After that date her memory is as good as\r\nyours or mine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen the first thing she remembers?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs landing with the survivors. Everything before that is a blank. She\r\ndid not know her own name, or where she had come from, or where she was.\r\nShe couldn\u2019t even speak her own tongue.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut surely all this is most unusual?\u201d put in Julius.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, my dear sir. Quite normal under the circumstances. Severe shock to\r\nthe nervous system. Loss of memory proceeds nearly always on the same\r\nlines. I suggested a specialist, of course. There\u2019s a very good man in\r\nParis--makes a study of these cases--but Mrs. Vandemeyer opposed the\r\nidea of publicity that might result from such a course.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can imagine she would,\u201d said Sir James grimly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI fell in with her views. There is a certain notoriety given to these\r\ncases. And the girl was very young--nineteen, I believe. It seemed\r\na pity that her infirmity should be talked about--might damage her\r\nprospects. Besides, there is no special treatment to pursue in such\r\ncases. It is really a matter of waiting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWaiting?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sooner or later, the memory will return--as suddenly as it\r\nwent. But in all probability the girl will have entirely forgotten the\r\nintervening period, and will take up life where she left off--at the\r\nsinking of the _Lusitania_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd when do you expect this to happen?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctor shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that I cannot say. Sometimes it is a matter of months, sometimes\r\nit has been known to be as long as twenty years! Sometimes another shock\r\ndoes the trick. One restores what the other took away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnother shock, eh?\u201d said Julius thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. There was a case in Colorado----\u201d The little man\u2019s voice\r\ntrailed on, voluble, mildly enthusiastic.\r\n\r\nJulius did not seem to be listening. He had relapsed into his own\r\nthoughts and was frowning. Suddenly he came out of his brown study,\r\nand hit the table such a resounding bang with his fist that every one\r\njumped, the doctor most of all.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it! I guess, doc, I\u2019d like your medical opinion on the plan\r\nI\u2019m about to outline. Say Jane was to cross the herring pond again, and\r\nthe same thing was to happen. The submarine, the sinking ship, every one\r\nto take to the boats--and so on. Wouldn\u2019t that do the trick? Wouldn\u2019t it\r\ngive a mighty big bump to her subconscious self, or whatever the jargon\r\nis, and start it functioning again right away?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA very interesting speculation, Mr. Hersheimmer. In my own opinion, it\r\nwould be successful. It is unfortunate that there is no chance of the\r\nconditions repeating themselves as you suggest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot by nature, perhaps, doc. But I\u2019m talking about art.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cArt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, yes. What\u2019s the difficulty? Hire a liner----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA liner!\u201d murmured Dr. Hall faintly.\r\n\r\n\u201cHire some passengers, hire a submarine--that\u2019s the only difficulty, I\r\nguess. Governments are apt to be a bit hide-bound over their engines of\r\nwar. They won\u2019t sell to the first-comer. Still, I guess that can be got\r\nover. Ever heard of the word \u2018graft,\u2019 sir? Well, graft gets there every\r\ntime! I reckon that we shan\u2019t really need to fire a torpedo. If every\r\none hustles round and screams loud enough that the ship is sinking, it\r\nought to be enough for an innocent young girl like Jane. By the time\r\nshe\u2019s got a life-belt on her, and is being hustled into a boat, with\r\na well-drilled lot of artistes doing the hysterical stunt on deck,\r\nwhy--she ought to be right back where she was in May, 1915. How\u2019s that\r\nfor the bare outline?\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Hall looked at Julius. Everything that he was for the moment\r\nincapable of saying was eloquent in that look.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Julius, in answer to it, \u201cI\u2019m not crazy. The thing\u2019s\r\nperfectly possible. It\u2019s done every day in the States for the movies.\r\nHaven\u2019t you seen trains in collision on the screen? What\u2019s the\r\ndifference between buying up a train and buying up a liner? Get the\r\nproperties and you can go right ahead!\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Hall found his voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the expense, my dear sir.\u201d His voice rose. \u201cThe expense! It will be\r\n_colossal!_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMoney doesn\u2019t worry me any,\u201d explained Julius simply.\r\n\r\nDr. Hall turned an appealing face to Sir James, who smiled slightly.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Hersheimmer is very well off--very well off indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctor\u2019s glance came back to Julius with a new and subtle quality in\r\nit. This was no longer an eccentric young fellow with a habit of falling\r\noff trees. The doctor\u2019s eyes held the deference accorded to a really\r\nrich man.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery remarkable plan. Very remarkable,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThe movies--of\r\ncourse! Your American word for the kinema. Very interesting. I fear we\r\nare perhaps a little behind the times over here in our methods. And you\r\nreally mean to carry out this remarkable plan of yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou bet your bottom dollar I do.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctor believed him--which was a tribute to his nationality. If an\r\nEnglishman had suggested such a thing, he would have had grave doubts as\r\nto his sanity.\r\n\r\n\u201cI cannot guarantee a cure,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cPerhaps I ought to make\r\nthat quite clear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure, that\u2019s all right,\u201d said Julius. \u201cYou just trot out Jane, and\r\nleave the rest to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJane?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Janet Vandemeyer, then. Can we get on the long distance to your\r\nplace right away, and ask them to send her up; or shall I run down and\r\nfetch her in my car?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctor stared.\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon, Mr. Hersheimmer. I thought you understood.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUnderstood what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat Miss Vandemeyer is no longer under my care.\u201d\r\n\nJULIUS sprang up.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you were aware of that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did she leave?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me see. To-day is Monday, is it not? It must have been last\r\nWednesday--why, surely--yes, it was the same evening that you--er--fell\r\nout of my tree.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat evening? Before, or after?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me see--oh yes, afterwards. A very urgent message arrived from Mrs.\r\nVandemeyer. The young lady and the nurse who was in charge of her left\r\nby the night train.\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius sank back again into his chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cNurse Edith--left with a patient--I remember,\u201d he muttered. \u201cMy God, to\r\nhave been so near!\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Hall looked bewildered.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Is the young lady not with her aunt, after all?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence shook her head. She was about to speak when a warning glance\r\nfrom Sir James made her hold her tongue. The lawyer rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m much obliged to you, Hall. We\u2019re very grateful for all you\u2019ve\r\ntold us. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re now in the position of having to track Miss\r\nVandemeyer anew. What about the nurse who accompanied her; I suppose you\r\ndon\u2019t know where she is?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctor shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve not heard from her, as it happens. I understood she was to remain\r\nwith Miss Vandemeyer for a while. But what can have happened? Surely the\r\ngirl has not been kidnapped.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat remains to be seen,\u201d said Sir James gravely.\r\n\r\nThe other hesitated.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do not think I ought to go to the police?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no. In all probability the young lady is with other relations.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctor was not completely satisfied, but he saw that Sir James was\r\ndetermined to say no more, and realized that to try and extract\r\nmore information from the famous K.C. would be mere waste of labour.\r\nAccordingly, he wished them goodbye, and they left the hotel. For a few\r\nminutes they stood by the car talking.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow maddening,\u201d cried Tuppence. \u201cTo think that Julius must have been\r\nactually under the same roof with her for a few hours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was a darned idiot,\u201d muttered Julius gloomily.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t know,\u201d Tuppence consoled him. \u201cCould he?\u201d She appealed to\r\nSir James.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should advise you not to worry,\u201d said the latter kindly. \u201cNo use\r\ncrying over spilt milk, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe great thing is what to do next,\u201d added Tuppence the practical.\r\n\r\nSir James shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou might advertise for the nurse who accompanied the girl. That is\r\nthe only course I can suggest, and I must confess I do not hope for much\r\nresult. Otherwise there is nothing to be done.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing?\u201d said Tuppence blankly. \u201cAnd--Tommy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must hope for the best,\u201d said Sir James. \u201cOh yes, we must go on\r\nhoping.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut over her downcast head his eyes met Julius\u2019s, and almost\r\nimperceptibly he shook his head. Julius understood. The lawyer\r\nconsidered the case hopeless. The young American\u2019s face grew grave. Sir\r\nJames took Tuppence\u2019s hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must let me know if anything further comes to light. Letters will\r\nalways be forwarded.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence stared at him blankly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are going away?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI told you. Don\u2019t you remember? To Scotland.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but I thought----\u201d The girl hesitated.\r\n\r\nSir James shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear young lady, I can do nothing more, I fear. Our clues have all\r\nended in thin air. You can take my word for it that there is nothing\r\nmore to be done. If anything should arise, I shall be glad to advise you\r\nin any way I can.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis words gave Tuppence an extraordinarily desolate feeling.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyway, thank you very much for\r\ntrying to help us. Good-bye.\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius was bending over the car. A momentary pity came into Sir James\u2019s\r\nkeen eyes, as he gazed into the girl\u2019s downcast face.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be too disconsolate, Miss Tuppence,\u201d he said in a low voice.\r\n\u201cRemember, holiday-time isn\u2019t always all playtime. One sometimes manages\r\nto put in some work as well.\u201d\r\n\r\nSomething in his tone made Tuppence glance up sharply. He shook his head\r\nwith a smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I shan\u2019t say any more. Great mistake to say too much. Remember\r\nthat. Never tell all you know--not even to the person you know best.\r\nUnderstand? Good-bye.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe strode away. Tuppence stared after him. She was beginning to\r\nunderstand Sir James\u2019s methods. Once before he had thrown her a hint\r\nin the same careless fashion. Was this a hint? What exactly lay\r\nbehind those last brief words? Did he mean that, after all, he had not\r\nabandoned the case; that, secretly, he would be working on it still\r\nwhile----\r\n\r\nHer meditations were interrupted by Julius, who adjured her to \u201cget\r\nright in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking kind of thoughtful,\u201d he remarked as they started off.\r\n\u201cDid the old guy say anything more?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence opened her mouth impulsively, and then shut it again. Sir\r\nJames\u2019s words sounded in her ears: \u201cNever tell all you know--not even\r\nto the person you know best.\u201d And like a flash there came into her mind\r\nanother memory. Julius before the safe in the flat, her own question and\r\nthe pause before his reply, \u201cNothing.\u201d Was there really nothing? Or\r\nhad he found something he wished to keep to himself? If he could make a\r\nreservation, so could she.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing particular,\u201d she replied.\r\n\r\nShe felt rather than saw Julius throw a sideways glance at her.\r\n\r\n\u201cSay, shall we go for a spin in the park?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you like.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a while they ran on under the trees in silence. It was a beautiful\r\nday. The keen rush through the air brought a new exhilaration to\r\nTuppence.\r\n\r\n\u201cSay, Miss Tuppence, do you think I\u2019m ever going to find Jane?\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius spoke in a discouraged voice. The mood was so alien to him that\r\nTuppence turned and stared at him in surprise. He nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so. I\u2019m getting down and out over the business. Sir James to-day\r\nhadn\u2019t got any hope at all, I could see that. I don\u2019t like him--we don\u2019t\r\ngee together somehow--but he\u2019s pretty cute, and I guess he wouldn\u2019t quit\r\nif there was any chance of success--now, would he?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence felt rather uncomfortable, but clinging to her belief that\r\nJulius also had withheld something from her, she remained firm.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe suggested advertising for the nurse,\u201d she reminded him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, with a \u2018forlorn hope\u2019 flavour to his voice! No--I\u2019m about fed up.\r\nI\u2019ve half a mind to go back to the States right away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no!\u201d cried Tuppence. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find Tommy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI sure forgot Beresford,\u201d said Julius contritely. \u201cThat\u2019s so. We must\r\nfind him. But after--well, I\u2019ve been day-dreaming ever since I started\r\non this trip--and these dreams are rotten poor business. I\u2019m quit of\r\nthem. Say, Miss Tuppence, there\u2019s something I\u2019d like to ask you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou and Beresford. What about it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand you,\u201d replied Tuppence with dignity, adding rather\r\ninconsequently: \u201cAnd, anyway, you\u2019re wrong!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot got a sort of kindly feeling for one another?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly not,\u201d said Tuppence with warmth. \u201cTommy and I are\r\nfriends--nothing more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess every pair of lovers has said that sometime or another,\u201d\r\n observed Julius.\r\n\r\n\u201cNonsense!\u201d snapped Tuppence. \u201cDo I look the sort of girl that\u2019s always\r\nfalling in love with every man she meets?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do not. You look the sort of girl that\u2019s mighty often getting\r\nfallen in love with!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Tuppence, rather taken aback. \u201cThat\u2019s a compliment, I\r\nsuppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure. Now let\u2019s get down to this. Supposing we never find Beresford\r\nand--and----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right--say it! I can face facts. Supposing he\u2019s--dead! Well?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd all this business fiddles out. What are you going to do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Tuppence forlornly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be darned lonesome, you poor kid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall be all right,\u201d snapped Tuppence with her usual resentment of\r\nany kind of pity.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about marriage?\u201d inquired Julius. \u201cGot any views on the subject?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI intend to marry, of course,\u201d replied Tuppence. \u201cThat is, if\u201d--she\r\npaused, knew a momentary longing to draw back, and then stuck to her\r\nguns bravely--\u201cI can find some one rich enough to make it worth my\r\nwhile. That\u2019s frank, isn\u2019t it? I dare say you despise me for it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never despise business instinct,\u201d said Julius. \u201cWhat particular\r\nfigure have you in mind?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFigure?\u201d asked Tuppence, puzzled. \u201cDo you mean tall or short?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. Sum--income.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I--I haven\u2019t quite worked that out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d\r\n\r\n_\u201cYou?\u201d_\r\n\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I couldn\u2019t!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you I couldn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAgain, why not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would seem so unfair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anything unfair about it. I call your bluff, that\u2019s all. I\r\nadmire you immensely, Miss Tuppence, more than any girl I\u2019ve ever met.\r\nYou\u2019re so darned plucky. I\u2019d just love to give you a real, rattling good\r\ntime. Say the word, and we\u2019ll run round right away to some high-class\r\njeweller, and fix up the ring business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d gasped Tuppence.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause of Beresford?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, _no!_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell then?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence merely continued to shake her head violently.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t reasonably expect more dollars than I\u2019ve got.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it isn\u2019t that,\u201d gasped Tuppence with an almost hysterical laugh.\r\n\u201cBut thanking you very much, and all that, I think I\u2019d better say no.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d be obliged if you\u2019d do me the favour to think it over until\r\nto-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no use.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStill, I guess we\u2019ll leave it like that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Tuppence meekly.\r\n\r\nNeither of them spoke again until they reached the _Ritz_.\r\n\r\nTuppence went upstairs to her room. She felt morally battered to the\r\nground after her conflict with Julius\u2019s vigorous personality. Sitting\r\ndown in front of the glass, she stared at her own reflection for some\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n\u201cFool,\u201d murmured Tuppence at length, making a grimace. \u201cLittle fool.\r\nEverything you want--everything you\u2019ve ever hoped for, and you go and\r\nbleat out \u2018no\u2019 like an idiotic little sheep. It\u2019s your one chance. Why\r\ndon\u2019t you take it? Grab it? Snatch at it? What more do you want?\u201d\r\n\r\nAs if in answer to her own question, her eyes fell on a small snapshot\r\nof Tommy that stood on her dressing-table in a shabby frame. For a\r\nmoment she struggled for self-control, and then abandoning all presence,\r\nshe held it to her lips and burst into a fit of sobbing.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Tommy, Tommy,\u201d she cried, \u201cI do love you so--and I may never see\r\nyou again....\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the end of five minutes Tuppence sat up, blew her nose, and pushed\r\nback her hair.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s that,\u201d she observed sternly. \u201cLet\u2019s look facts in the face. I\r\nseem to have fallen in love--with an idiot of a boy who probably doesn\u2019t\r\ncare two straws about me.\u201d Here she paused. \u201cAnyway,\u201d she resumed, as\r\nthough arguing with an unseen opponent, \u201cI don\u2019t _know_ that he does.\r\nHe\u2019d never have dared to say so. I\u2019ve always jumped on sentiment--and\r\nhere I am being more sentimental than anybody. What idiots girls are!\r\nI\u2019ve always thought so. I suppose I shall sleep with his photograph\r\nunder my pillow, and dream about him all night. It\u2019s dreadful to feel\r\nyou\u2019ve been false to your principles.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence shook her head sadly, as she reviewed her backsliding.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say to Julius, I\u2019m sure. Oh, what a fool I feel!\r\nI\u2019ll have to say _something_--he\u2019s so American and thorough, he\u2019ll\r\ninsist upon having a reason. I wonder if he did find anything in that\r\nsafe----\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence\u2019s meditations went off on another tack. She reviewed the events\r\nof last night carefully and persistently. Somehow, they seemed bound up\r\nwith Sir James\u2019s enigmatical words....\r\n\r\nSuddenly she gave a great start--the colour faded out of her face. Her\r\neyes, fascinated, gazed in front of her, the pupils dilated.\r\n\r\n\u201cImpossible,\u201d she murmured. \u201cImpossible! I must be going mad even to\r\nthink of such a thing....\u201d\r\n\r\nMonstrous--yet it explained everything....\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\u2019s reflection she sat down and wrote a note, weighing each\r\nword as she did so. Finally she nodded her head as though satisfied, and\r\nslipped it into an envelope which she addressed to Julius. She went\r\ndown the passage to his sitting-room and knocked at the door. As she had\r\nexpected, the room was empty. She left the note on the table.\r\n\r\nA small page-boy was waiting outside her own door when she returned to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\u201cTelegram for you, miss.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence took it from the salver, and tore it open carelessly. Then she\r\ngave a cry. The telegram was from Tommy!\r\n\nFROM a darkness punctuated with throbbing stabs of fire, Tommy dragged\r\nhis senses slowly back to life. When he at last opened his eyes, he was\r\nconscious of nothing but an excruciating pain through his temples. He\r\nwas vaguely aware of unfamiliar surroundings. Where was he? What had\r\nhappened? He blinked feebly. This was not his bedroom at the _Ritz_. And\r\nwhat the devil was the matter with his head?\r\n\r\n\u201cDamn!\u201d said Tommy, and tried to sit up. He had remembered. He was in\r\nthat sinister house in Soho. He uttered a groan and fell back. Through\r\nhis almost-closed lids he reconnoitred carefully.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is coming to,\u201d remarked a voice very near Tommy\u2019s ear. He recognized\r\nit at once for that of the bearded and efficient German, and lay\r\nartistically inert. He felt that it would be a pity to come round too\r\nsoon; and until the pain in his head became a little less acute, he felt\r\nquite incapable of collecting his wits. Painfully he tried to puzzle out\r\nwhat had happened. Obviously somebody must have crept up behind him as\r\nhe listened and struck him down with a blow on the head. They knew\r\nhim now for a spy, and would in all probability give him short shrift.\r\nUndoubtedly he was in a tight place. Nobody knew where he was, therefore\r\nhe need expect no outside assistance, and must depend solely on his own\r\nwits.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, here goes,\u201d murmured Tommy to himself, and repeated his former\r\nremark.\r\n\r\n\u201cDamn!\u201d he observed, and this time succeeded in sitting up.\r\n\r\nIn a minute the German stepped forward and placed a glass to his lips,\r\nwith the brief command \u201cDrink.\u201d Tommy obeyed. The potency of the draught\r\nmade him choke, but it cleared his brain in a marvellous manner.\r\n\r\nHe was lying on a couch in the room in which the meeting had been held.\r\nOn one side of him was the German, on the other the villainous-faced\r\ndoorkeeper who had let him in. The others were grouped together at a\r\nlittle distance away. But Tommy missed one face. The man known as Number\r\nOne was no longer of the company.\r\n\r\n\u201cFeel better?\u201d asked the German, as he removed the empty glass.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, thanks,\u201d returned Tommy cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, my young friend, it is lucky for you your skull is so thick. The\r\ngood Conrad struck hard.\u201d He indicated the evil-faced doorkeeper by a\r\nnod. The man grinned.\r\n\r\nTommy twisted his head round with an effort.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cso you\u2019re Conrad, are you? It strikes me the thickness\r\nof my skull was lucky for you too. When I look at you I feel it\u2019s almost\r\na pity I\u2019ve enabled you to cheat the hangman.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man snarled, and the bearded man said quietly:\r\n\r\n\u201cHe would have run no risk of that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust as you like,\u201d replied Tommy. \u201cI know it\u2019s the fashion to run down\r\nthe police. I rather believe in them myself.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis manner was nonchalant to the last degree. Tommy Beresford was one\r\nof those young Englishmen not distinguished by any special intellectual\r\nability, but who are emphatically at their best in what is known as a\r\n\u201ctight place.\u201d Their natural diffidence and caution fall from them like\r\na glove. Tommy realized perfectly that in his own wits lay the only\r\nchance of escape, and behind his casual manner he was racking his brains\r\nfuriously.\r\n\r\nThe cold accents of the German took up the conversation:\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you anything to say before you are put to death as a spy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSimply lots of things,\u201d replied Tommy with the same urbanity as before.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you deny that you were listening at that door?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not. I must really apologize--but your conversation was so\r\ninteresting that it overcame my scruples.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you get in?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDear old Conrad here.\u201d Tommy smiled deprecatingly at him. \u201cI hesitate\r\nto suggest pensioning off a faithful servant, but you really ought to\r\nhave a better watchdog.\u201d\r\n\r\nConrad snarled impotently, and said sullenly, as the man with the beard\r\nswung round upon him:\r\n\r\n\u201cHe gave the word. How was I to know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Tommy chimed in. \u201cHow was he to know? Don\u2019t blame the poor\r\nfellow. His hasty action has given me the pleasure of seeing you all\r\nface to face.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe fancied that his words caused some discomposure among the group, but\r\nthe watchful German stilled it with a wave of his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cDead men tell no tales,\u201d he said evenly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Tommy, \u201cbut I\u2019m not dead yet!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou soon will be, my young friend,\u201d said the German.\r\n\r\nAn assenting murmur came from the others.\r\n\r\nTommy\u2019s heart beat faster, but his casual pleasantness did not waver.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think not,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cI should have a great objection to\r\ndying.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe had got them puzzled, he saw that by the look on his captor\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you give us any reason why we should not put you to death?\u201d asked\r\nthe German.\r\n\r\n\u201cSeveral,\u201d replied Tommy. \u201cLook here, you\u2019ve been asking me a lot of\r\nquestions. Let me ask you one for a change. Why didn\u2019t you kill me off\r\nat once before I regained consciousness?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe German hesitated, and Tommy seized his advantage.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause you didn\u2019t know how much I knew--and where I obtained that\r\nknowledge. If you kill me now, you never will know.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut here the emotions of Boris became too much for him. He stepped\r\nforward waving his arms.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou hell-hound of a spy,\u201d he screamed. \u201cWe will give you short shrift.\r\nKill him! Kill him!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a roar of applause.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou hear?\u201d said the German, his eyes on Tommy. \u201cWhat have you to say to\r\nthat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSay?\u201d Tommy shrugged his shoulders. \u201cPack of fools. Let them ask\r\nthemselves a few questions. How did I get into this place? Remember what\r\ndear old Conrad said-- _with your own password_, wasn\u2019t it? How did I\r\nget hold of that? You don\u2019t suppose I came up those steps haphazard and\r\nsaid the first thing that came into my head?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy was pleased with the concluding words of this speech. His only\r\nregret was that Tuppence was not present to appreciate its full flavour.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d said the working man suddenly. \u201cComrades, we have been\r\nbetrayed!\u201d\r\n\r\nAn ugly murmur arose. Tommy smiled at them encouragingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better. How can you hope to make a success of any job if you\r\ndon\u2019t use your brains?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will tell us who has betrayed us,\u201d said the German. \u201cBut that shall\r\nnot save you--oh, no! You shall tell us all that you know. Boris, here,\r\nknows pretty ways of making people speak!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBah!\u201d said Tommy scornfully, fighting down a singularly unpleasant\r\nfeeling in the pit of his stomach. \u201cYou will neither torture me nor kill\r\nme.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why not?\u201d asked Boris.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause you\u2019d kill the goose that lays the golden eggs,\u201d replied Tommy\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary pause. It seemed as though Tommy\u2019s persistent\r\nassurance was at last conquering. They were no longer completely sure of\r\nthemselves. The man in the shabby clothes stared at Tommy searchingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s bluffing you, Boris,\u201d he said quietly.\r\n\r\nTommy hated him. Had the man seen through him?\r\n\r\nThe German, with an effort, turned roughly to Tommy.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think I mean?\u201d parried Tommy, searching desperately in his\r\nown mind.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Boris stepped forward, and shook his fist in Tommy\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n\u201cSpeak, you swine of an Englishman--speak!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get so excited, my good fellow,\u201d said Tommy calmly. \u201cThat\u2019s the\r\nworst of you foreigners. You can\u2019t keep calm. Now, I ask you, do I look\r\nas though I thought there were the least chance of your killing me?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked confidently round, and was glad they could not hear the\r\npersistent beating of his heart which gave the lie to his words.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d admitted Boris at last sullenly, \u201cyou do not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank God, he\u2019s not a mind reader,\u201d thought Tommy. Aloud he pursued his\r\nadvantage:\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why am I so confident? Because I know something that puts me in a\r\nposition to propose a bargain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA bargain?\u201d The bearded man took him up sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes--a bargain. My life and liberty against----\u201d He paused.\r\n\r\n\u201cAgainst what?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe group pressed forward. You could have heard a pin drop.\r\n\r\nSlowly Tommy spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe papers that Danvers brought over from America in the _Lusitania_.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe effect of his words was electrical. Every one was on his feet.\r\nThe German waved them back. He leaned over Tommy, his face purple with\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Himmel!_ You have got them, then?\u201d\r\n\r\nWith magnificent calm Tommy shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know where they are?\u201d persisted the German.\r\n\r\nAgain Tommy shook his head. \u201cNot in the least.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen--then----\u201d angry and baffled, the words failed him.\r\n\r\nTommy looked round. He saw anger and bewilderment on every face, but his\r\ncalm assurance had done its work--no one doubted but that something lay\r\nbehind his words.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where the papers are--but I believe that I can find them.\r\nI have a theory----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPah!\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy raised his hand, and silenced the clamours of disgust.\r\n\r\n\u201cI call it a theory--but I\u2019m pretty sure of my facts--facts that are\r\nknown to no one but myself. In any case what do you lose? If I can\r\nproduce the papers--you give me my life and liberty in exchange. Is it a\r\nbargain?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd if we refuse?\u201d said the German quietly.\r\n\r\nTommy lay back on the couch.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe 29th,\u201d he said thoughtfully, \u201cis less than a fortnight ahead----\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment the German hesitated. Then he made a sign to Conrad.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake him into the other room.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor five minutes, Tommy sat on the bed in the dingy room next door. His\r\nheart was beating violently. He had risked all on this throw. How would\r\nthey decide? And all the while that this agonized questioning went on\r\nwithin him, he talked flippantly to Conrad, enraging the cross-grained\r\ndoorkeeper to the point of homicidal mania.\r\n\r\nAt last the door opened, and the German called imperiously to Conrad to\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope the judge hasn\u2019t put his black cap on,\u201d remarked Tommy\r\nfrivolously. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Conrad, march me in. The prisoner is at the\r\nbar, gentlemen.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe German was seated once more behind the table. He motioned to Tommy\r\nto sit down opposite to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe accept,\u201d he said harshly, \u201con terms. The papers must be delivered to\r\nus before you go free.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIdiot!\u201d said Tommy amiably. \u201cHow do you think I can look for them if\r\nyou keep me tied by the leg here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you expect, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI must have liberty to go about the business in my own way.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe German laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you think we are little children to let you walk out of here leaving\r\nus a pretty story full of promises?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Tommy thoughtfully. \u201cThough infinitely simpler for me, I\r\ndid not really think you would agree to that plan. Very well, we must\r\narrange a compromise. How would it be if you attached little Conrad here\r\nto my person. He\u2019s a faithful fellow, and very ready with the fist.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe prefer,\u201d said the German coldly, \u201cthat you should remain here.\r\nOne of our number will carry out your instructions minutely. If the\r\noperations are complicated, he will return to you with a report and you\r\ncan instruct him further.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re tying my hands,\u201d complained Tommy. \u201cIt\u2019s a very delicate affair,\r\nand the other fellow will muff it up as likely as not, and then where\r\nshall I be? I don\u2019t believe one of you has got an ounce of tact.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe German rapped the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cThose are our terms. Otherwise, death!\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy leaned back wearily.\r\n\r\n\u201cI like your style. Curt, but attractive. So be it, then. But one thing\r\nis essential, I must see the girl.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat girl?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJane Finn, of course.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe other looked at him curiously for some minutes, then he said slowly,\r\nand as though choosing his words with care:\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you not know that she can tell you nothing?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy\u2019s heart beat a little faster. Would he succeed in coming face to\r\nface with the girl he was seeking?\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall not ask her to tell me anything,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cNot in so\r\nmany words, that is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen why see her?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy paused.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo watch her face when I ask her one question,\u201d he replied at last.\r\n\r\nAgain there was a look in the German\u2019s eyes that Tommy did not quite\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe will not be able to answer your question.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat does not matter. I shall have seen her face when I ask it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you think that will tell you anything?\u201d He gave a short\r\ndisagreeable laugh. More than ever, Tommy felt that there was a\r\nfactor somewhere that he did not understand. The German looked at\r\nhim searchingly. \u201cI wonder whether, after all, you know as much as we\r\nthink?\u201d he said softly.\r\n\r\nTommy felt his ascendancy less sure than a moment before. His hold had\r\nslipped a little. But he was puzzled. What had he said wrong? He spoke\r\nout on the impulse of the moment.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere may be things that you know which I do not. I have not pretended\r\nto be aware of all the details of your show. But equally I\u2019ve got\r\nsomething up my sleeve that _you_ don\u2019t know about. And that\u2019s where I\r\nmean to score. Danvers was a damned clever fellow----\u201d He broke off as\r\nif he had said too much.\r\n\r\nBut the German\u2019s face had lightened a little.\r\n\r\n\u201cDanvers,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI see----\u201d He paused a minute, then waved to\r\nConrad. \u201cTake him away. Upstairs--you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d said Tommy. \u201cWhat about the girl?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat may perhaps be arranged.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will see about it. Only one person can decide that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d asked Tommy. But he knew the answer.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Brown----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShall I see him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d said Conrad harshly.\r\n\r\nTommy rose obediently. Outside the door his gaoler motioned to him to\r\nmount the stairs. He himself followed close behind. On the floor above\r\nConrad opened a door and Tommy passed into a small room. Conrad lit a\r\nhissing gas burner and went out. Tommy heard the sound of the key being\r\nturned in the lock.\r\n\r\nHe set to work to examine his prison. It was a smaller room than the\r\none downstairs, and there was something peculiarly airless about the\r\natmosphere of it. Then he realized that there was no window. He walked\r\nround it. The walls were filthily dirty, as everywhere else. Four\r\npictures hung crookedly on the wall representing scenes from Faust.\r\nMarguerite with her box of jewels, the church scene, Siebel and his\r\nflowers, and Faust and Mephistopheles. The latter brought Tommy\u2019s mind\r\nback to Mr. Brown again. In this sealed and closed chamber, with its\r\nclose-fitting heavy door, he felt cut off from the world, and the\r\nsinister power of the arch-criminal seemed more real. Shout as he would,\r\nno one could ever hear him. The place was a living tomb....\r\n\r\nWith an effort Tommy pulled himself together. He sank on to the bed\r\nand gave himself up to reflection. His head ached badly; also, he was\r\nhungry. The silence of the place was dispiriting.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d said Tommy, trying to cheer himself, \u201cI shall see the\r\nchief--the mysterious Mr. Brown and with a bit of luck in bluffing I\r\nshall see the mysterious Jane Finn also. After that----\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter that Tommy was forced to admit the prospect looked dreary.\r\n\nTHE troubles of the future, however, soon faded before the troubles of\r\nthe present. And of these, the most immediate and pressing was that of\r\nhunger. Tommy had a healthy and vigorous appetite. The steak and\r\nchips partaken of for lunch seemed now to belong to another decade. He\r\nregretfully recognized the fact that he would not make a success of a\r\nhunger strike.\r\n\r\nHe prowled aimlessly about his prison. Once or twice he discarded\r\ndignity, and pounded on the door. But nobody answered the summons.\r\n\r\n\u201cHang it all!\u201d said Tommy indignantly. \u201cThey can\u2019t mean to starve me\r\nto death.\u201d A new-born fear passed through his mind that this might,\r\nperhaps, be one of those \u201cpretty ways\u201d of making a prisoner speak, which\r\nhad been attributed to Boris. But on reflection he dismissed the idea.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s that sour-faced brute Conrad,\u201d he decided. \u201cThat\u2019s a fellow I\r\nshall enjoy getting even with one of these days. This is just a bit of\r\nspite on his part. I\u2019m certain of it.\u201d\r\n\r\nFurther meditations induced in him the feeling that it would be\r\nextremely pleasant to bring something down with a whack on Conrad\u2019s\r\negg-shaped head. Tommy stroked his own head tenderly, and gave himself\r\nup to the pleasures of imagination. Finally a bright idea flashed\r\nacross his brain. Why not convert imagination into reality? Conrad\r\nwas undoubtedly the tenant of the house. The others, with the possible\r\nexception of the bearded German, merely used it as a rendezvous.\r\nTherefore, why not wait in ambush for Conrad behind the door, and when\r\nhe entered bring down a chair, or one of the decrepit pictures, smartly\r\non to his head. One would, of course, be careful not to hit too hard.\r\nAnd then--and then, simply walk out! If he met anyone on the way down,\r\nwell---- Tommy brightened at the thought of an encounter with his fists.\r\nSuch an affair was infinitely more in his line than the verbal encounter\r\nof this afternoon. Intoxicated by his plan, Tommy gently unhooked the\r\npicture of the Devil and Faust, and settled himself in position. His\r\nhopes were high. The plan seemed to him simple but excellent.\r\n\r\nTime went on, but Conrad did not appear. Night and day were the same\r\nin this prison room, but Tommy\u2019s wrist-watch, which enjoyed a certain\r\ndegree of accuracy, informed him that it was nine o\u2019clock in the\r\nevening. Tommy reflected gloomily that if supper did not arrive soon\r\nit would be a question of waiting for breakfast. At ten o\u2019clock hope\r\ndeserted him, and he flung himself on the bed to seek consolation in\r\nsleep. In five minutes his woes were forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe sound of the key turning in the lock awoke him from his slumbers.\r\nNot belonging to the type of hero who is famous for awaking in full\r\npossession of his faculties, Tommy merely blinked at the ceiling and\r\nwondered vaguely where he was. Then he remembered, and looked at his\r\nwatch. It was eight o\u2019clock.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s either early morning tea or breakfast,\u201d deduced the young man,\r\n\u201cand pray God it\u2019s the latter!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe door swung open. Too late, Tommy remembered his scheme of\r\nobliterating the unprepossessing Conrad. A moment later he was glad that\r\nhe had, for it was not Conrad who entered, but a girl. She carried a\r\ntray which she set down on the table.\r\n\r\nIn the feeble light of the gas burner Tommy blinked at her. He decided\r\nat once that she was one of the most beautiful girls he had ever seen.\r\nHer hair was a full rich brown, with sudden glints of gold in it as\r\nthough there were imprisoned sunbeams struggling in its depths. There\r\nwas a wild-rose quality about her face. Her eyes, set wide apart, were\r\nhazel, a golden hazel that again recalled a memory of sunbeams.\r\n\r\nA delirious thought shot through Tommy\u2019s mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you Jane Finn?\u201d he asked breathlessly.\r\n\r\nThe girl shook her head wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name is Annette, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe spoke in a soft, broken English.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Tommy, rather taken aback. _\u201cFran\u00e7aise?\u201d_ he hazarded.\r\n\r\n\u201cOui, monsieur. Monsieur parle fran\u00e7ais?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot for any length of time,\u201d said Tommy. \u201cWhat\u2019s that? Breakfast?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl nodded. Tommy dropped off the bed and came and inspected the\r\ncontents of the tray. It consisted of a loaf, some margarine, and a jug\r\nof coffee.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe living is not equal to the _Ritz_,\u201d he observed with a sigh. \u201cBut\r\nfor what we are at last about to receive the Lord has made me truly\r\nthankful. Amen.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe drew up a chair, and the girl turned away to the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cWait a sec,\u201d cried Tommy. \u201cThere are lots of things I want to ask you,\r\nAnnette. What are you doing in this house? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re Conrad\u2019s\r\nniece, or daughter, or anything, because I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do the _service_, monsieur. I am not related to anybody.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Tommy. \u201cYou know what I asked you just now. Have you ever\r\nheard that name?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have heard people speak of Jane Finn, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know where she is?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnnette shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not in this house, for instance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no, monsieur. I must go now--they will be waiting for me.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe hurried out. The key turned in the lock.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder who \u2018they\u2019 are,\u201d mused Tommy, as he continued to make inroads\r\non the loaf. \u201cWith a bit of luck, that girl might help me to get out of\r\nhere. She doesn\u2019t look like one of the gang.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt one o\u2019clock Annette reappeared with another tray, but this time\r\nConrad accompanied her.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d said Tommy amiably. \u201cYou have _not_ used Pear\u2019s soap, I\r\nsee.\u201d\r\n\r\nConrad growled threateningly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo light repartee, have you, old bean? There, there, we can\u2019t always\r\nhave brains as well as beauty. What have we for lunch? Stew? How did I\r\nknow? Elementary, my dear Watson--the smell of onions is unmistakable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTalk away,\u201d grunted the man. \u201cIt\u2019s little enough time you\u2019ll have to\r\ntalk in, maybe.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe remark was unpleasant in its suggestion, but Tommy ignored it. He\r\nsat down at the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cRetire, varlet,\u201d he said, with a wave of his hand. \u201cPrate not to thy\r\nbetters.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat evening Tommy sat on the bed, and cogitated deeply. Would Conrad\r\nagain accompany the girl? If he did not, should he risk trying to make\r\nan ally of her? He decided that he must leave no stone unturned. His\r\nposition was desperate.\r\n\r\nAt eight o\u2019clock the familiar sound of the key turning made him spring\r\nto his feet. The girl was alone.\r\n\r\n\u201cShut the door,\u201d he commanded. \u201cI want to speak to you.\u201d She obeyed.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here, Annette, I want you to help me get out of this.\u201d She shook\r\nher head.\r\n\r\n\u201cImpossible. There are three of them on the floor below.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Tommy was secretly grateful for the information. \u201cBut you would\r\nhelp me if you could?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl hesitated.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think--they are my own people. You have spied upon them. They are\r\nquite right to keep you here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re a bad lot, Annette. If you\u2019ll help me, I\u2019ll take you away from\r\nthe lot of them. And you\u2019d probably get a good whack of money.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the girl merely shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cI dare not, monsieur; I am afraid of them.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe turned away.\r\n\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you do anything to help another girl?\u201d cried Tommy. \u201cShe\u2019s\r\nabout your age too. Won\u2019t you save her from their clutches?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean Jane Finn?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is her you came here to look for? Yes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl looked at him, then passed her hand across her forehead.\r\n\r\n\u201cJane Finn. Always I hear that name. It is familiar.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy came forward eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must know _something_ about her?\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the girl turned away abruptly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know nothing--only the name.\u201d She walked towards the door. Suddenly\r\nshe uttered a cry. Tommy stared. She had caught sight of the picture\r\nhe had laid against the wall the night before. For a moment he caught a\r\nlook of terror in her eyes. As inexplicably it changed to relief. Then\r\nabruptly she went out of the room. Tommy could make nothing of it. Did\r\nshe fancy that he had meant to attack her with it? Surely not. He rehung\r\nthe picture on the wall thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nThree more days went by in dreary inaction. Tommy felt the strain\r\ntelling on his nerves. He saw no one but Conrad and Annette, and the\r\ngirl had become dumb. She spoke only in monosyllables. A kind of dark\r\nsuspicion smouldered in her eyes. Tommy felt that if this solitary\r\nconfinement went on much longer he would go mad. He gathered from Conrad\r\nthat they were waiting for orders from \u201cMr. Brown.\u201d Perhaps, thought\r\nTommy, he was abroad or away, and they were obliged to wait for his\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nBut the evening of the third day brought a rude awakening.\r\n\r\nIt was barely seven o\u2019clock when he heard the tramp of footsteps outside\r\nin the passage. In another minute the door was flung open. Conrad\r\nentered. With him was the evil-looking Number 14. Tommy\u2019s heart sank at\r\nthe sight of them.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvenin\u2019, gov\u2019nor,\u201d said the man with a leer. \u201cGot those ropes, mate?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe silent Conrad produced a length of fine cord. The next minute Number\r\n14\u2019s hands, horribly dexterous, were winding the cord round his limbs,\r\nwhile Conrad held him down.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the devil----?\u201d began Tommy.\r\n\r\nBut the slow, speechless grin of the silent Conrad froze the words on\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\nNumber 14 proceeded deftly with his task. In another minute Tommy was a\r\nmere helpless bundle. Then at last Conrad spoke:\r\n\r\n\u201cThought you\u2019d bluffed us, did you? With what you knew, and what you\r\ndidn\u2019t know. Bargained with us! And all the time it was bluff! Bluff!\r\nYou know less than a kitten. But your number\u2019s up now all right, you\r\nb---- swine.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy lay silent. There was nothing to say. He had failed. Somehow\r\nor other the omnipotent Mr. Brown had seen through his pretensions.\r\nSuddenly a thought occurred to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cA very good speech, Conrad,\u201d he said approvingly. \u201cBut wherefore the\r\nbonds and fetters? Why not let this kind gentleman here cut my throat\r\nwithout delay?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGarn,\u201d said Number 14 unexpectedly. \u201cThink we\u2019re as green as to do you\r\nin here, and have the police nosing round? Not \u2018alf! We\u2019ve ordered the\r\ncarriage for your lordship to-morrow mornin\u2019, but in the meantime we\u2019re\r\nnot taking any chances, see!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Tommy, \u201ccould be plainer than your words--unless it was\r\nyour face.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStow it,\u201d said Number 14.\r\n\r\n\u201cWith pleasure,\u201d replied Tommy. \u201cYou\u2019re making a sad mistake--but yours\r\nwill be the loss.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t kid us that way again,\u201d said Number 14. \u201cTalking as though\r\nyou were still at the blooming _Ritz_, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy made no reply. He was engaged in wondering how Mr. Brown had\r\ndiscovered his identity. He decided that Tuppence, in the throes of\r\nanxiety, had gone to the police, and that his disappearance having been\r\nmade public the gang had not been slow to put two and two together.\r\n\r\nThe two men departed and the door slammed. Tommy was left to his\r\nmeditations. They were not pleasant ones. Already his limbs felt cramped\r\nand stiff. He was utterly helpless, and he could see no hope anywhere.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour had passed when he heard the key softly turned, and the\r\ndoor opened. It was Annette. Tommy\u2019s heart beat a little faster. He had\r\nforgotten the girl. Was it possible that she had come to his help?\r\n\r\nSuddenly he heard Conrad\u2019s voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cCome out of it, Annette. He doesn\u2019t want any supper to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOui, oui, je sais bien. But I must take the other tray. We need the\r\nthings on it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, hurry up,\u201d growled Conrad.\r\n\r\nWithout looking at Tommy the girl went over to the table, and picked up\r\nthe tray. She raised a hand and turned out the light.\r\n\r\n\u201cCurse you\u201d--Conrad had come to the door--\u201cwhy did you do that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI always turn it out. You should have told me. Shall I relight it,\r\nMonsieur Conrad?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, come on out of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLe beau petit monsieur,\u201d cried Annette, pausing by the bed in the\r\ndarkness. \u201cYou have tied him up well, _hein?_ He is like a trussed\r\nchicken!\u201d The frank amusement in her tone jarred on the boy; but at\r\nthat moment, to his amazement, he felt her hand running lightly over\r\nhis bonds, and something small and cold was pressed into the palm of his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome on, Annette.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMais me voil\u00e0.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe door shut. Tommy heard Conrad say:\r\n\r\n\u201cLock it and give me the key.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe footsteps died away. Tommy lay petrified with amazement. The object\r\nAnnette had thrust into his hand was a small penknife, the blade open.\r\nFrom the way she had studiously avoided looking at him, and her action\r\nwith the light, he came to the conclusion that the room was overlooked.\r\nThere must be a peep-hole somewhere in the walls. Remembering how\r\nguarded she had always been in her manner, he saw that he had probably\r\nbeen under observation all the time. Had he said anything to give\r\nhimself away? Hardly. He had revealed a wish to escape and a desire\r\nto find Jane Finn, but nothing that could have given a clue to his\r\nown identity. True, his question to Annette had proved that he was\r\npersonally unacquainted with Jane Finn, but he had never pretended\r\notherwise. The question now was, did Annette really know more? Were her\r\ndenials intended primarily for the listeners? On that point he could\r\ncome to no conclusion.\r\n\r\nBut there was a more vital question that drove out all others. Could he,\r\nbound as he was, manage to cut his bonds? He essayed cautiously to\r\nrub the open blade up and down on the cord that bound his two wrists\r\ntogether. It was an awkward business, and drew a smothered \u201cOw\u201d of pain\r\nfrom him as the knife cut into his wrist. But slowly and doggedly he\r\nwent on sawing to and fro. He cut the flesh badly, but at last he felt\r\nthe cord slacken. With his hands free, the rest was easy. Five minutes\r\nlater he stood upright with some difficulty, owing to the cramp in his\r\nlimbs. His first care was to bind up his bleeding wrist. Then he sat on\r\nthe edge of the bed to think. Conrad had taken the key of the door, so\r\nhe could expect little more assistance from Annette. The only outlet\r\nfrom the room was the door, consequently he would perforce have to wait\r\nuntil the two men returned to fetch him. But when they did.... Tommy\r\nsmiled! Moving with infinite caution in the dark room, he found and\r\nunhooked the famous picture. He felt an economical pleasure that his\r\nfirst plan would not be wasted. There was now nothing to do but to wait.\r\nHe waited.\r\n\r\nThe night passed slowly. Tommy lived through an eternity of hours, but\r\nat last he heard footsteps. He stood upright, drew a deep breath, and\r\nclutched the picture firmly.\r\n\r\nThe door opened. A faint light streamed in from outside. Conrad went\r\nstraight towards the gas to light it. Tommy deeply regretted that it was\r\nhe who had entered first. It would have been pleasant to get even with\r\nConrad. Number 14 followed. As he stepped across the threshold, Tommy\r\nbrought the picture down with terrific force on his head. Number 14 went\r\ndown amidst a stupendous crash of broken glass. In a minute Tommy had\r\nslipped out and pulled to the door. The key was in the lock. He turned\r\nit and withdrew it just as Conrad hurled himself against the door from\r\nthe inside with a volley of curses.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Tommy hesitated. There was the sound of some one stirring\r\non the floor below. Then the German\u2019s voice came up the stairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cGott im Himmel! Conrad, what is it?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy felt a small hand thrust into his. Beside him stood Annette. She\r\npointed up a rickety ladder that apparently led to some attics.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuick--up here!\u201d She dragged him after her up the ladder. In another\r\nmoment they were standing in a dusty garret littered with lumber. Tommy\r\nlooked round.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis won\u2019t do. It\u2019s a regular trap. There\u2019s no way out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHush! Wait.\u201d The girl put her finger to her lips. She crept to the top\r\nof the ladder and listened.\r\n\r\nThe banging and beating on the door was terrific. The German and another\r\nwere trying to force the door in. Annette explained in a whisper:\r\n\r\n\u201cThey will think you are still inside. They cannot hear what Conrad\r\nsays. The door is too thick.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you could hear what went on in the room?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is a peep-hole into the next room. It was clever of you to guess.\r\nBut they will not think of that--they are only anxious to get in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes--but look here----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLeave it to me.\u201d She bent down. To his amazement, Tommy saw that she\r\nwas fastening the end of a long piece of string to the handle of a big\r\ncracked jug. She arranged it carefully, then turned to Tommy.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you the key of the door?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGive it to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe handed it to her.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am going down. Do you think you can go halfway, and then swing\r\nyourself down _behind_ the ladder, so that they will not see you?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big cupboard in the shadow of the landing. Stand behind it.\r\nTake the end of this string in your hand. When I\u2019ve let the others out--\r\n_pull! _\u201d\r\n\r\nBefore he had time to ask her anything more, she had flitted lightly\r\ndown the ladder and was in the midst of the group with a loud cry:\r\n\r\n\u201cMon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Qu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019il y a?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe German turned on her with an oath.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet out of this. Go to your room!\u201d\r\n\r\nVery cautiously Tommy swung himself down the back of the ladder. So\r\nlong as they did not turn round ... all was well. He crouched behind the\r\ncupboard. They were still between him and the stairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d Annette appeared to stumble over something. She stooped. \u201cMon\r\nDieu, voil\u00e0 la clef!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe German snatched it from her. He unlocked the door. Conrad stumbled\r\nout, swearing.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is he? Have you got him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have seen no one,\u201d said the German sharply. His face paled. \u201cWho do\r\nyou mean?\u201d\r\n\r\nConrad gave vent to another oath.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s got away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cImpossible. He would have passed us.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt that moment, with an ecstatic smile Tommy pulled the string. A crash\r\nof crockery came from the attic above. In a trice the men were pushing\r\neach other up the rickety ladder and had disappeared into the darkness\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nQuick as a flash Tommy leapt from his hiding-place and dashed down the\r\nstairs, pulling the girl with him. There was no one in the hall. He\r\nfumbled over the bolts and chain. At last they yielded, the door swung\r\nopen. He turned. Annette had disappeared.\r\n\r\nTommy stood spell-bound. Had she run upstairs again? What madness\r\npossessed her! He fumed with impatience, but he stood his ground. He\r\nwould not go without her.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly there was an outcry overhead, an exclamation from the\r\nGerman, and then Annette\u2019s voice, clear and high:\r\n\r\n\u201cMa foi, he has escaped! And quickly! Who would have thought it?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy still stood rooted to the ground. Was that a command to him to go?\r\nHe fancied it was.\r\n\r\nAnd then, louder still, the words floated down to him:\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a terrible house. I want to go back to Marguerite. To\r\nMarguerite. _To Marguerite!_\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy had run back to the stairs. She wanted him to go and leave her.\r\nBut why? At all costs he must try and get her away with him. Then his\r\nheart sank. Conrad was leaping down the stairs, uttering a savage cry at\r\nthe sight of him. After him came the others.\r\n\r\nTommy stopped Conrad\u2019s rush with a straight blow with his fist. It\r\ncaught the other on the point of the jaw and he fell like a log. The\r\nsecond man tripped over his body and fell. From higher up the staircase\r\nthere was a flash, and a bullet grazed Tommy\u2019s ear. He realized that\r\nit would be good for his health to get out of this house as soon as\r\npossible. As regards Annette he could do nothing. He had got even with\r\nConrad, which was one satisfaction. The blow had been a good one.\r\n\r\nHe leapt for the door, slamming it behind him. The square was deserted.\r\nIn front of the house was a baker\u2019s van. Evidently he was to have been\r\ntaken out of London in that, and his body found many miles from the\r\nhouse in Soho. The driver jumped to the pavement and tried to bar\r\nTommy\u2019s way. Again Tommy\u2019s fist shot out, and the driver sprawled on the\r\npavement.\r\n\r\nTommy took to his heels and ran--none too soon. The front door opened\r\nand a hail of bullets followed him. Fortunately none of them hit him. He\r\nturned the corner of the square.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s one thing,\u201d he thought to himself, \u201cthey can\u2019t go on shooting.\r\nThey\u2019ll have the police after them if they do. I wonder they dared to\r\nthere.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe heard the footsteps of his pursuers behind him, and redoubled his own\r\npace. Once he got out of these by-ways he would be safe. There would be\r\na policeman about somewhere--not that he really wanted to invoke the aid\r\nof the police if he could possibly do without it. It meant explanations,\r\nand general awkwardness. In another moment he had reason to bless his\r\nluck. He stumbled over a prostrate figure, which started up with a yell\r\nof alarm and dashed off down the street. Tommy drew back into a doorway.\r\nIn a minute he had the pleasure of seeing his two pursuers, of whom the\r\nGerman was one, industriously tracking down the red herring!\r\n\r\nTommy sat down quietly on the doorstep and allowed a few moments to\r\nelapse while he recovered his breath. Then he strolled gently in the\r\nopposite direction. He glanced at his watch. It was a little after\r\nhalf-past five. It was rapidly growing light. At the next corner he\r\npassed a policeman. The policeman cast a suspicious eye on him. Tommy\r\nfelt slightly offended. Then, passing his hand over his face, he\r\nlaughed. He had not shaved or washed for three days! What a guy he must\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nHe betook himself without more ado to a Turkish Bath establishment which\r\nhe knew to be open all night. He emerged into the busy daylight feeling\r\nhimself once more, and able to make plans.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, he must have a square meal. He had eaten nothing since\r\nmidday yesterday. He turned into an A.B.C. shop and ordered eggs and\r\nbacon and coffee. Whilst he ate, he read a morning paper propped up\r\nin front of him. Suddenly he stiffened. There was a long article on\r\nKramenin, who was described as the \u201cman behind Bolshevism\u201d in Russia,\r\nand who had just arrived in London--some thought as an unofficial envoy.\r\nHis career was sketched lightly, and it was firmly asserted that he,\r\nand not the figurehead leaders, had been the author of the Russian\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the page was his portrait.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s who Number 1 is,\u201d said Tommy with his mouth full of eggs and\r\nbacon. \u201cNot a doubt about it, I must push on.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe paid for his breakfast, and betook himself to Whitehall. There he\r\nsent up his name, and the message that it was urgent. A few minutes\r\nlater he was in the presence of the man who did not here go by the name\r\nof \u201cMr. Carter.\u201d There was a frown on his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here, you\u2019ve no business to come asking for me in this way. I\r\nthought that was distinctly understood?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was, sir. But I judged it important to lose no time.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd as briefly and succinctly as possible he detailed the experiences of\r\nthe last few days.\r\n\r\nHalf-way through, Mr. Carter interrupted him to give a few cryptic\r\norders through the telephone. All traces of displeasure had now left his\r\nface. He nodded energetically when Tommy had finished.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite right. Every moment\u2019s of value. Fear we shall be too late anyway.\r\nThey wouldn\u2019t wait. Would clear out at once. Still, they may have left\r\nsomething behind them that will be a clue. You say you\u2019ve recognized\r\nNumber 1 to be Kramenin? That\u2019s important. We want something against him\r\nbadly to prevent the Cabinet falling on his neck too freely. What about\r\nthe others? You say two faces were familiar to you? One\u2019s a Labour man,\r\nyou think? Just look through these photos, and see if you can spot him.\u201d\r\n\r\nA minute later, Tommy held one up. Mr. Carter exhibited some surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, Westway! Shouldn\u2019t have thought it. Poses as being moderate. As for\r\nthe other fellow, I think I can give a good guess.\u201d He handed another\r\nphotograph to Tommy, and smiled at the other\u2019s exclamation. \u201cI\u2019m right,\r\nthen. Who is he? Irishman. Prominent Unionist M.P. All a blind, of\r\ncourse. We\u2019ve suspected it--but couldn\u2019t get any proof. Yes, you\u2019ve done\r\nvery well, young man. The 29th, you say, is the date. That gives us very\r\nlittle time--very little time indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut----\u201d Tommy hesitated.\r\n\r\nMr. Carter read his thoughts.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe can deal with the General Strike menace, I think. It\u2019s a\r\ntoss-up--but we\u2019ve got a sporting chance! But if that draft treaty turns\r\nup--we\u2019re done. England will be plunged in anarchy. Ah, what\u2019s that?\r\nThe car? Come on, Beresford, we\u2019ll go and have a look at this house of\r\nyours.\u201d\r\n\r\nTwo constables were on duty in front of the house in Soho. An inspector\r\nreported to Mr. Carter in a low voice. The latter turned to Tommy.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe birds have flown--as we thought. We might as well go over it.\u201d\r\n\r\nGoing over the deserted house seemed to Tommy to partake of the\r\ncharacter of a dream. Everything was just as it had been. The prison\r\nroom with the crooked pictures, the broken jug in the attic, the meeting\r\nroom with its long table. But nowhere was there a trace of papers.\r\nEverything of that kind had either been destroyed or taken away. And\r\nthere was no sign of Annette.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat you tell me about the girl puzzled me,\u201d said Mr. Carter. \u201cYou\r\nbelieve that she deliberately went back?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would seem so, sir. She ran upstairs while I was getting the door\r\nopen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cH\u2019m, she must belong to the gang, then; but, being a woman, didn\u2019t feel\r\nlike standing by to see a personable young man killed. But evidently\r\nshe\u2019s in with them, or she wouldn\u2019t have gone back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe she\u2019s really one of them, sir. She--seemed so\r\ndifferent----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-looking, I suppose?\u201d said Mr. Carter with a smile that made Tommy\r\nflush to the roots of his hair. He admitted Annette\u2019s beauty rather\r\nshamefacedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d observed Mr. Carter, \u201chave you shown yourself to Miss\r\nTuppence yet? She\u2019s been bombarding me with letters about you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTuppence? I was afraid she might get a bit rattled. Did she go to the\r\npolice?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Carter shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I wonder how they twigged me.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Carter looked inquiringly at him, and Tommy explained. The other\r\nnodded thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue, that\u2019s rather a curious point. Unless the mention of the _Ritz_\r\nwas an accidental remark?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt might have been, sir. But they must have found out about me suddenly\r\nin some way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Mr. Carter, looking round him, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing more to be\r\ndone here. What about some lunch with me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThanks awfully, sir. But I think I\u2019d better get back and rout out\r\nTuppence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course. Give her my kind regards and tell her not to believe you\u2019re\r\nkilled too readily next time.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy grinned.\r\n\r\n\u201cI take a lot of killing, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I perceive,\u201d said Mr. Carter dryly. \u201cWell, good-bye. Remember you\u2019re\r\na marked man now, and take reasonable care of yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nHailing a taxi briskly Tommy stepped in, and was swiftly borne to the\r\n_Ritz_, dwelling the while on the pleasurable anticipation of startling\r\nTuppence.\r\n\r\n\u201cWonder what she\u2019s been up to. Dogging \u2018Rita\u2019 most likely. By the way,\r\nI suppose that\u2019s who Annette meant by Marguerite. I didn\u2019t get it at the\r\ntime.\u201d The thought saddened him a little, for it seemed to prove that\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer and the girl were on intimate terms.\r\n\r\nThe taxi drew up at the _Ritz_. Tommy burst into its sacred portals\r\neagerly, but his enthusiasm received a check. He was informed that Miss\r\nCowley had gone out a quarter of an hour ago.\r\n\nBAFFLED for the moment, Tommy strolled into the restaurant, and ordered\r\na meal of surpassing excellence. His four days\u2019 imprisonment had taught\r\nhim anew to value good food.\r\n\r\nHe was in the middle of conveying a particularly choice morsel of Sole\r\n\u00e0 la Jeanette to his mouth, when he caught sight of Julius entering\r\nthe room. Tommy waved a menu cheerfully, and succeeded in attracting the\r\nother\u2019s attention. At the sight of Tommy, Julius\u2019s eyes seemed as though\r\nthey would pop out of his head. He strode across, and pump-handled\r\nTommy\u2019s hand with what seemed to the latter quite unnecessary vigour.\r\n\r\n\u201cHoly snakes!\u201d he ejaculated. \u201cIs it really you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course it is. Why shouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t it be? Say, man, don\u2019t you know you\u2019ve been given up\r\nfor dead? I guess we\u2019d have had a solemn requiem for you in another few\r\ndays.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho thought I was dead?\u201d demanded Tommy.\r\n\r\n\u201cTuppence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe remembered the proverb about the good dying young, I suppose. There\r\nmust be a certain amount of original sin in me to have survived. Where\r\nis Tuppence, by the way?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t she here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, the fellows at the office said she\u2019d just gone out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGone shopping, I guess. I dropped her here in the car about an hour\r\nago. But, say, can\u2019t you shed that British calm of yours, and get down\r\nto it? What on God\u2019s earth have you been doing all this time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re feeding here,\u201d replied Tommy, \u201corder now. It\u2019s going to be a\r\nlong story.\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius drew up a chair to the opposite side of the table, summoned a\r\nhovering waiter, and dictated his wishes. Then he turned to Tommy.\r\n\r\n\u201cFire ahead. I guess you\u2019ve had some few adventures.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne or two,\u201d replied Tommy modestly, and plunged into his recital.\r\n\r\nJulius listened spellbound. Half the dishes that were placed before him\r\nhe forgot to eat. At the end he heaved a long sigh.\r\n\r\n\u201cBully for you. Reads like a dime novel!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now for the home front,\u201d said Tommy, stretching out his hand for a\r\npeach.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe-el,\u201d drawled Julius, \u201cI don\u2019t mind admitting we\u2019ve had some\r\nadventures too.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe, in his turn, assumed the r\u00f4le of narrator. Beginning with his\r\nunsuccessful reconnoitring at Bournemouth, he passed on to his return\r\nto London, the buying of the car, the growing anxieties of Tuppence,\r\nthe call upon Sir James, and the sensational occurrences of the previous\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut who killed her?\u201d asked Tommy. \u201cI don\u2019t quite understand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe doctor kidded himself she took it herself,\u201d replied Julius dryly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Sir James? What did he think?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBeing a legal luminary, he is likewise a human oyster,\u201d replied Julius.\r\n\u201cI should say he \u2018reserved judgment.\u2019\u201d He went on to detail the events\r\nof the morning.\r\n\r\n\u201cLost her memory, eh?\u201d said Tommy with interest. \u201cBy Jove, that explains\r\nwhy they looked at me so queerly when I spoke of questioning her. Bit of\r\na slip on my part, that! But it wasn\u2019t the sort of thing a fellow would\r\nbe likely to guess.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t give you any sort of hint as to where Jane was?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy shook his head regretfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a word. I\u2019m a bit of an ass, as you know. I ought to have got more\r\nout of them somehow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re lucky to be here at all. That bluff of yours was the\r\ngoods all right. How you ever came to think of it all so pat beats me to\r\na frazzle!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was in such a funk I had to think of something,\u201d said Tommy simply.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\u2019s pause, and then Tommy reverted to Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt it was chloral?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe not. At least they call it heart failure induced by an\r\noverdose, or some such claptrap. It\u2019s all right. We don\u2019t want to\r\nbe worried with an inquest. But I guess Tuppence and I and even the\r\nhighbrow Sir James have all got the same idea.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Brown?\u201d hazarded Tommy.\r\n\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll the same,\u201d he said thoughtfully, \u201cMr. Brown hasn\u2019t got wings. I\r\ndon\u2019t see how he got in and out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow about some high-class thought transference stunt? Some magnetic\r\ninfluence that irresistibly impelled Mrs. Vandemeyer to commit suicide?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy looked at him with respect.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood, Julius. Distinctly good. Especially the phraseology. But it\r\nleaves me cold. I yearn for a real Mr. Brown of flesh and blood. I think\r\nthe gifted young detectives must get to work, study the entrances and\r\nexits, and tap the bumps on their foreheads until the solution of the\r\nmystery dawns on them. Let\u2019s go round to the scene of the crime. I wish\r\nwe could get hold of Tuppence. The _Ritz_ would enjoy the spectacle of\r\nthe glad reunion.\u201d\r\n\r\nInquiry at the office revealed the fact that Tuppence had not yet\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll the same, I guess I\u2019ll have a look round upstairs,\u201d said Julius.\r\n\u201cShe might be in my sitting-room.\u201d He disappeared.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a diminutive boy spoke at Tommy\u2019s elbow:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe young lady--she\u2019s gone away by train, I think, sir,\u201d he murmured\r\nshyly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tommy wheeled round upon him.\r\n\r\nThe small boy became pinker than before.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe taxi, sir. I heard her tell the driver Charing Cross and to look\r\nsharp.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy stared at him, his eyes opening wide in surprise. Emboldened, the\r\nsmall boy proceeded. \u201cSo I thought, having asked for an A.B.C. and a\r\nBradshaw.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy interrupted him:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did she ask for an A.B.C. and a Bradshaw?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I took her the telegram, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA telegram?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen was that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout half-past twelve, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me exactly what happened.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe small boy drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cI took up a telegram to No. 891--the lady was there. She opened it\r\nand gave a gasp, and then she said, very jolly like: \u2018Bring me up a\r\nBradshaw, and an A.B.C., and look sharp, Henry.\u2019 My name isn\u2019t Henry,\r\nbut----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind your name,\u201d said Tommy impatiently. \u201cGo on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. I brought them, and she told me to wait, and looked up\r\nsomething. And then she looks up at the clock, and \u2018Hurry up,\u2019 she says.\r\n\u2018Tell them to get me a taxi,\u2019 and she begins a-shoving on of her hat in\r\nfront of the glass, and she was down in two ticks, almost as quick as I\r\nwas, and I seed her going down the steps and into the taxi, and I heard\r\nher call out what I told you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe small boy stopped and replenished his lungs. Tommy continued to\r\nstare at him. At that moment Julius rejoined him. He held an open letter\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cI say, Hersheimmer\u201d--Tommy turned to him--\u201cTuppence has gone off\r\nsleuthing on her own.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShucks!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, she has. She went off in a taxi to Charing Cross in the deuce of a\r\nhurry after getting a telegram.\u201d His eye fell on the letter in Julius\u2019s\r\nhand. \u201cOh; she left a note for you. That\u2019s all right. Where\u2019s she off\r\nto?\u201d\r\n\r\nAlmost unconsciously, he held out his hand for the letter, but\r\nJulius folded it up and placed it in his pocket. He seemed a trifle\r\nembarrassed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess this is nothing to do with it. It\u2019s about something\r\nelse--something I asked her that she was to let me know about.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Tommy looked puzzled, and seemed waiting for more.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee here,\u201d said Julius suddenly, \u201cI\u2019d better put you wise. I asked Miss\r\nTuppence to marry me this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Tommy mechanically. He felt dazed. Julius\u2019s words were\r\ntotally unexpected. For the moment they benumbed his brain.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to tell you,\u201d continued Julius, \u201cthat before I suggested\r\nanything of the kind to Miss Tuppence, I made it clear that I didn\u2019t\r\nwant to butt in in any way between her and you----\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy roused himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cTuppence and I have been pals for\r\nyears. Nothing more.\u201d He lit a cigarette with a hand that shook ever\r\nso little. \u201cThat\u2019s quite all right. Tuppence always said that she was\r\nlooking out for----\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly, his face crimsoning, but Julius was in no way\r\ndiscomposed.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I guess it\u2019ll be the dollars that\u2019ll do the trick. Miss Tuppence\r\nput me wise to that right away. There\u2019s no humbug about her. We ought to\r\ngee along together very well.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy looked at him curiously for a minute, as though he were about\r\nto speak, then changed his mind and said nothing. Tuppence and Julius!\r\nWell, why not? Had she not lamented the fact that she knew no rich men?\r\nHad she not openly avowed her intention of marrying for money if she\r\never had the chance? Her meeting with the young American millionaire\r\nhad given her the chance--and it was unlikely she would be slow to avail\r\nherself of it. She was out for money. She had always said so. Why blame\r\nher because she had been true to her creed?\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Tommy did blame her. He was filled with a passionate and\r\nutterly illogical resentment. It was all very well to _say_ things\r\nlike that--but a _real_ girl would never marry for money. Tuppence was\r\nutterly cold-blooded and selfish, and he would be delighted if he never\r\nsaw her again! And it was a rotten world!\r\n\r\nJulius\u2019s voice broke in on these meditations.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, we ought to gee along together very well. I\u2019ve heard that a girl\r\nalways refuses you once--a sort of convention.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy caught his arm.\r\n\r\n\u201cRefuses? Did you say _refuses?_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure thing. Didn\u2019t I tell you that? She just rapped out a \u2018no\u2019 without\r\nany kind of reason to it. The eternal feminine, the Huns call it, I\u2019ve\r\nheard. But she\u2019ll come round right enough. Likely enough, I hustled her\r\nsome----\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Tommy interrupted regardless of decorum.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did she say in that note?\u201d he demanded fiercely.\r\n\r\nThe obliging Julius handed it to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no earthly clue in it as to where she\u2019s gone,\u201d he assured\r\nTommy. \u201cBut you might as well see for yourself if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe note, in Tuppence\u2019s well-known schoolboy writing, ran as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201cDEAR JULIUS,\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s always better to have things in black and white. I don\u2019t feel I\r\ncan be bothered to think of marriage until Tommy is found. Let\u2019s leave\r\nit till then.\r\n\r\n\u201cYours affectionately,\r\n\r\n\u201cTUPPENCE.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy handed it back, his eyes shining. His feelings had undergone a\r\nsharp reaction. He now felt that Tuppence was all that was noble and\r\ndisinterested. Had she not refused Julius without hesitation? True, the\r\nnote betokened signs of weakening, but he could excuse that. It read\r\nalmost like a bribe to Julius to spur him on in his efforts to find\r\nTommy, but he supposed she had not really meant it that way. Darling\r\nTuppence, there was not a girl in the world to touch her! When he saw\r\nher----His thoughts were brought up with a sudden jerk.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs you say,\u201d he remarked, pulling himself together, \u201cthere\u2019s not a hint\r\nhere as to what she\u2019s up to. Hi--Henry!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe small boy came obediently. Tommy produced five shillings.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne thing more. Do you remember what the young lady did with the\r\ntelegram?\u201d\r\n\r\nHenry gasped and spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe crumpled it up into a ball and threw it into the grate, and made a\r\nsort of noise like \u2018Whoop!\u2019 sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery graphic, Henry,\u201d said Tommy. \u201cHere\u2019s your five shillings. Come on,\r\nJulius. We must find that telegram.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey hurried upstairs. Tuppence had left the key in her door. The room\r\nwas as she had left it. In the fireplace was a crumpled ball of orange\r\nand white. Tommy disentangled it and smoothed out the telegram.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome at once, Moat House, Ebury, Yorkshire, great developments--TOMMY.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other in stupefaction. Julius spoke first:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t send it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course not. What does it mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess it means the worst,\u201d said Julius quietly. \u201cThey\u2019ve got her.\u201d\r\n\r\n_\u201cWhat?\u201d_\r\n\r\n\u201cSure thing! They signed your name, and she fell into the trap like a\r\nlamb.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God! What shall we do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGet busy, and go after her! Right now! There\u2019s no time to waste. It\u2019s\r\nalmighty luck that she didn\u2019t take the wire with her. If she had we\u2019d\r\nprobably never have traced her. But we\u2019ve got to hustle. Where\u2019s that\r\nBradshaw?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe energy of Julius was infectious. Left to himself, Tommy would\r\nprobably have sat down to think things out for a good half-hour before\r\nhe decided on a plan of action. But with Julius Hersheimmer about,\r\nhustling was inevitable.\r\n\r\nAfter a few muttered imprecations he handed the Bradshaw to Tommy as\r\nbeing more conversant with its mysteries. Tommy abandoned it in favour\r\nof an A.B.C.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere we are. Ebury, Yorks. From King\u2019s Cross. Or St. Pancras. (Boy must\r\nhave made a mistake. It was King\u2019s Cross, not _Charing_ Cross.) 12.50,\r\nthat\u2019s the train she went by. 2.10, that\u2019s gone. 3.20 is the next--and a\r\ndamned slow train too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about the car?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cSend it up if you like, but we\u2019d better stick to the train. The great\r\nthing is to keep calm.\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius groaned.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so. But it gets my goat to think of that innocent young girl in\r\ndanger!\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy nodded abstractedly. He was thinking. In a moment or two, he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cI say, Julius, what do they want her for, anyway?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEh? I don\u2019t get you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I mean is that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s their game to do her any harm,\u201d\r\n explained Tommy, puckering his brow with the strain of his mental\r\nprocesses. \u201cShe\u2019s a hostage, that\u2019s what she is. She\u2019s in no immediate\r\ndanger, because if we tumble on to anything, she\u2019d be damned useful to\r\nthem. As long as they\u2019ve got her, they\u2019ve got the whip hand of us. See?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d said Julius thoughtfully. \u201cThat\u2019s so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBesides,\u201d added Tommy, as an afterthought, \u201cI\u2019ve great faith in\r\nTuppence.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe journey was wearisome, with many stops, and crowded carriages. They\r\nhad to change twice, once at Doncaster, once at a small junction. Ebury\r\nwas a deserted station with a solitary porter, to whom Tommy addressed\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you tell me the way to the Moat House?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Moat House? It\u2019s a tidy step from here. The big house near the sea,\r\nyou mean?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy assented brazenly. After listening to the porter\u2019s meticulous\r\nbut perplexing directions, they prepared to leave the station. It was\r\nbeginning to rain, and they turned up the collars of their coats as they\r\ntrudged through the slush of the road. Suddenly Tommy halted.\r\n\r\n\u201cWait a moment.\u201d He ran back to the station and tackled the porter anew.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here, do you remember a young lady who arrived by an earlier\r\ntrain, the 12.50 from London? She\u2019d probably ask you the way to the Moat\r\nHouse.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe described Tuppence as well as he could, but the porter shook his\r\nhead. Several people had arrived by the train in question. He could not\r\ncall to mind one young lady in particular. But he was quite certain that\r\nno one had asked him the way to the Moat House.\r\n\r\nTommy rejoined Julius, and explained. Depression was settling on him\r\nlike a leaden weight. He felt convinced that their quest was going to\r\nbe unsuccessful. The enemy had over three hours\u2019 start. Three hours was\r\nmore than enough for Mr. Brown. He would not ignore the possibility of\r\nthe telegram having been found.\r\n\r\nThe way seemed endless. Once they took the wrong turning and went nearly\r\nhalf a mile out of their direction. It was past seven o\u2019clock when a\r\nsmall boy told them that \u201ct\u2019 Moat House\u201d was just past the next corner.\r\n\r\nA rusty iron gate swinging dismally on its hinges! An overgrown drive\r\nthick with leaves. There was something about the place that struck a\r\nchill to both their hearts. They went up the deserted drive. The leaves\r\ndeadened their footsteps. The daylight was almost gone. It was like\r\nwalking in a world of ghosts. Overhead the branches flapped and creaked\r\nwith a mournful note. Occasionally a sodden leaf drifted silently down,\r\nstartling them with its cold touch on their cheek.\r\n\r\nA turn of the drive brought them in sight of the house. That, too,\r\nseemed empty and deserted. The shutters were closed, the steps up to\r\nthe door overgrown with moss. Was it indeed to this desolate spot\r\nthat Tuppence had been decoyed? It seemed hard to believe that a human\r\nfootstep had passed this way for months.\r\n\r\nJulius jerked the rusty bell handle. A jangling peal rang discordantly,\r\nechoing through the emptiness within. No one came. They rang again and\r\nagain--but there was no sign of life. Then they walked completely round\r\nthe house. Everywhere silence, and shuttered windows. If they could\r\nbelieve the evidence of their eyes the place was empty.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing doing,\u201d said Julius.\r\n\r\nThey retraced their steps slowly to the gate.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere must be a village handy,\u201d continued the young American. \u201cWe\u2019d\r\nbetter make inquiries there. They\u2019ll know something about the place, and\r\nwhether there\u2019s been anyone there lately.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s not a bad idea.\u201d\r\n\r\nProceeding up the road, they soon came to a little hamlet. On the\r\noutskirts of it, they met a workman swinging his bag of tools, and Tommy\r\nstopped him with a question.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Moat House? It\u2019s empty. Been empty for years. Mrs. Sweeny\u2019s got the\r\nkey if you want to go over it--next to the post office.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy thanked him. They soon found the post office, which was also a\r\nsweet and general fancy shop, and knocked at the door of the cottage\r\nnext to it. A clean, wholesome-looking woman opened it. She readily\r\nproduced the key of the Moat House.\r\n\r\n\u201cThough I doubt if it\u2019s the kind of place to suit you, sir. In a\r\nterrible state of repair. Ceilings leaking and all. \u2018Twould need a lot\r\nof money spent on it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Tommy cheerily. \u201cI dare say it\u2019ll be a washout, but\r\nhouses are scarce nowadays.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat they are,\u201d declared the woman heartily. \u201cMy daughter and\r\nson-in-law have been looking for a decent cottage for I don\u2019t know how\r\nlong. It\u2019s all the war. Upset things terribly, it has. But excuse me,\r\nsir, it\u2019ll be too dark for you to see much of the house. Hadn\u2019t you\r\nbetter wait until to-morrow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. We\u2019ll have a look around this evening, anyway. We\u2019d\r\nhave been here before only we lost our way. What\u2019s the best place to\r\nstay at for the night round here?\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Sweeny looked doubtful.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s the _Yorkshire Arms_, but it\u2019s not much of a place for\r\ngentlemen like you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it will do very well. Thanks. By the way, you\u2019ve not had a young\r\nlady here asking for this key to-day?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe woman shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo one\u2019s been over the place for a long time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThanks very much.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey retraced their steps to the Moat House. As the front door swung\r\nback on its hinges, protesting loudly, Julius struck a match and\r\nexamined the floor carefully. Then he shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d swear no one\u2019s passed this way. Look at the dust. Thick. Not a sign\r\nof a footmark.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey wandered round the deserted house. Everywhere the same tale. Thick\r\nlayers of dust apparently undisturbed.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis gets me,\u201d said Julius. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Tuppence was ever in this\r\nhouse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe must have been.\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius shook his head without replying.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go over it again to-morrow,\u201d said Tommy. \u201cPerhaps we\u2019ll see more\r\nin the daylight.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn the morrow they took up the search once more, and were reluctantly\r\nforced to the conclusion that the house had not been invaded for some\r\nconsiderable time. They might have left the village altogether but for\r\na fortunate discovery of Tommy\u2019s. As they were retracing their steps to\r\nthe gate, he gave a sudden cry, and stooping, picked something up from\r\namong the leaves, and held it out to Julius. It was a small gold brooch.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Tuppence\u2019s!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019ve often seen her wear it.\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius drew a deep breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess that settles it. She came as far as here, anyway. We\u2019ll make\r\nthat pub our head-quarters, and raise hell round here until we find her.\r\nSomebody _must_ have seen her.\u201d\r\n\r\nForthwith the campaign began. Tommy and Julius worked separately and\r\ntogether, but the result was the same. Nobody answering to Tuppence\u2019s\r\ndescription had been seen in the vicinity. They were baffled--but not\r\ndiscouraged. Finally they altered their tactics. Tuppence had certainly\r\nnot remained long in the neighbourhood of the Moat House. That pointed\r\nto her having been overcome and carried away in a car. They renewed\r\ninquiries. Had anyone seen a car standing somewhere near the Moat House\r\nthat day? Again they met with no success.\r\n\r\nJulius wired to town for his own car, and they scoured the neighbourhood\r\ndaily with unflagging zeal. A grey limousine on which they had set high\r\nhopes was traced to Harrogate, and turned out to be the property of a\r\nhighly respectable maiden lady!\r\n\r\nEach day saw them set out on a new quest. Julius was like a hound on\r\nthe leash. He followed up the slenderest clue. Every car that had passed\r\nthrough the village on the fateful day was tracked down. He forced his\r\nway into country properties and submitted the owners of the motors to\r\na searching cross-examination. His apologies were as thorough as his\r\nmethods, and seldom failed in disarming the indignation of his victims;\r\nbut, as day succeeded day, they were no nearer to discovering Tuppence\u2019s\r\nwhereabouts. So well had the abduction been planned that the girl seemed\r\nliterally to have vanished into thin air.\r\n\r\nAnd another preoccupation was weighing on Tommy\u2019s mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know how long we\u2019ve been here?\u201d he asked one morning as they\r\nsat facing each other at breakfast. \u201cA week! We\u2019re no nearer to finding\r\nTuppence, _and next Sunday is the_ 29_th!_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShucks!\u201d said Julius thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019d almost forgotten about the\r\n29th. I\u2019ve been thinking of nothing but Tuppence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo have I. At least, I hadn\u2019t forgotten about the 29th, but it didn\u2019t\r\nseem to matter a damn in comparison to finding Tuppence. But to-day\u2019s\r\nthe 23rd, and time\u2019s getting short. If we\u2019re ever going to get hold of\r\nher at all, we must do it before the 29th--her life won\u2019t be worth an\r\nhour\u2019s purchase afterwards. The hostage game will be played out by then.\r\nI\u2019m beginning to feel that we\u2019ve made a big mistake in the way we\u2019ve set\r\nabout this. We\u2019ve wasted time and we\u2019re no forrader.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m with you there. We\u2019ve been a couple of mutts, who\u2019ve bitten off a\r\nbigger bit than they can chew. I\u2019m going to quit fooling right away!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019m going to do what we ought to have done a week ago.\r\nI\u2019m going right back to London to put the case in the hands of your\r\nBritish police. We fancied ourselves as sleuths. Sleuths! It was a piece\r\nof damn-fool foolishness! I\u2019m through! I\u2019ve had enough of it. Scotland\r\nYard for me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d said Tommy slowly. \u201cI wish to God we\u2019d gone there right\r\naway.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBetter late than never. We\u2019ve been like a couple of babes playing \u2018Here\r\nwe go round the Mulberry Bush.\u2019 Now I\u2019m going right along to Scotland\r\nYard to ask them to take me by the hand and show me the way I should go.\r\nI guess the professional always scores over the amateur in the end. Are\r\nyou coming along with me?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the good? One of us is enough. I might as well stay here and\r\nnose round a bit longer. Something _might_ turn up. One never knows.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure thing. Well, so long. I\u2019ll be back in a couple of shakes with a\r\nfew inspectors along. I shall tell them to pick out their brightest and\r\nbest.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the course of events was not to follow the plan Julius had laid\r\ndown. Later in the day Tommy received a wire:\r\n\r\n\u201cJoin me Manchester Midland Hotel. Important news--JULIUS.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt 7.30 that night Tommy alighted from a slow cross-country train.\r\nJulius was on the platform.\r\n\r\n\u201cThought you\u2019d come by this train if you weren\u2019t out when my wire\r\narrived.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy grasped him by the arm.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it? Is Tuppence found?\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. But I found this waiting in London. Just arrived.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe handed the telegraph form to the other. Tommy\u2019s eyes opened as he\r\nread:\r\n\r\n\u201cJane Finn found. Come Manchester Midland Hotel immediately--PEEL\r\nEDGERTON.\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius took the form back and folded it up.\r\n\r\n\u201cQueer,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cI thought that lawyer chap had quit!\u201d\r\n\n\u201cMY train got in half an hour ago,\u201d explained Julius, as he led the way\r\nout of the station. \u201cI reckoned you\u2019d come by this before I left London,\r\nand wired accordingly to Sir James. He\u2019s booked rooms for us, and will\r\nbe round to dine at eight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat made you think he\u2019d ceased to take any interest in the case?\u201d\r\n asked Tommy curiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat he said,\u201d replied Julius dryly. \u201cThe old bird\u2019s as close as an\r\noyster! Like all the darned lot of them, he wasn\u2019t going to commit\r\nhimself till he was sure he could deliver the goods.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder,\u201d said Tommy thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nJulius turned on him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou wonder what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhether that was his real reason.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure. You bet your life it was.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy shook his head unconvinced.\r\n\r\nSir James arrived punctually at eight o\u2019clock, and Julius introduced\r\nTommy. Sir James shook hands with him warmly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am delighted to make your acquaintance, Mr. Beresford. I have heard\r\nso much about you from Miss Tuppence\u201d--he smiled involuntarily--\u201cthat it\r\nreally seems as though I already know you quite well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d said Tommy with his cheerful grin. He scanned the\r\ngreat lawyer eagerly. Like Tuppence, he felt the magnetism of the\r\nother\u2019s personality. He was reminded of Mr. Carter. The two men, totally\r\nunlike so far as physical resemblance went, produced a similar effect.\r\nBeneath the weary manner of the one and the professional reserve of the\r\nother, lay the same quality of mind, keen-edged like a rapier.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime he was conscious of Sir James\u2019s close scrutiny. When the\r\nlawyer dropped his eyes the young man had the feeling that the other had\r\nread him through and through like an open book. He could not but wonder\r\nwhat the final judgment was, but there was little chance of learning\r\nthat. Sir James took in everything, but gave out only what he chose. A\r\nproof of that occurred almost at once.\r\n\r\nImmediately the first greetings were over Julius broke out into a flood\r\nof eager questions. How had Sir James managed to track the girl? Why had\r\nhe not let them know that he was still working on the case? And so on.\r\n\r\nSir James stroked his chin and smiled. At last he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cJust so, just so. Well, she\u2019s found. And that\u2019s the great thing, isn\u2019t\r\nit? Eh! Come now, that\u2019s the great thing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure it is. But just how did you strike her trail? Miss Tuppence and I\r\nthought you\u2019d quit for good and all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d The lawyer shot a lightning glance at him, then resumed operations\r\non his chin. \u201cYou thought that, did you? Did you really? H\u2019m, dear me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I guess I can take it we were wrong,\u201d pursued Julius.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know that I should go so far as to say that. But it\u2019s\r\ncertainly fortunate for all parties that we\u2019ve managed to find the young\r\nlady.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut where is she?\u201d demanded Julius, his thoughts flying off on another\r\ntack. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be sure to bring her along?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat would hardly be possible,\u201d said Sir James gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause the young lady was knocked down in a street accident, and has\r\nsustained slight injuries to the head. She was taken to the infirmary,\r\nand on recovering consciousness gave her name as Jane Finn. When--ah!--I\r\nheard that, I arranged for her to be removed to the house of a\r\ndoctor--a friend of mine, and wired at once for you. She relapsed into\r\nunconsciousness and has not spoken since.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not seriously hurt?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, a bruise and a cut or two; really, from a medical point of view,\r\nabsurdly slight injuries to have produced such a condition. Her state is\r\nprobably to be attributed to the mental shock consequent on recovering\r\nher memory.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s come back?\u201d cried Julius excitedly.\r\n\r\nSir James tapped the table rather impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cUndoubtedly, Mr. Hersheimmer, since she was able to give her real name.\r\nI thought you had appreciated that point.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you just happened to be on the spot,\u201d said Tommy. \u201cSeems quite like\r\na fairy tale.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Sir James was far too wary to be drawn.\r\n\r\n\u201cCoincidences are curious things,\u201d he said dryly.\r\n\r\nNevertheless Tommy was now certain of what he had before only suspected.\r\nSir James\u2019s presence in Manchester was not accidental. Far from\r\nabandoning the case, as Julius supposed, he had by some means of his own\r\nsuccessfully run the missing girl to earth. The only thing that puzzled\r\nTommy was the reason for all this secrecy. He concluded that it was a\r\nfoible of the legal mind.\r\n\r\nJulius was speaking.\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter dinner,\u201d he announced, \u201cI shall go right away and see Jane.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will be impossible, I fear,\u201d said Sir James. \u201cIt is very unlikely\r\nthey would allow her to see visitors at this time of night. I should\r\nsuggest to-morrow morning about ten o\u2019clock.\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius flushed. There was something in Sir James which always stirred\r\nhim to antagonism. It was a conflict of two masterful personalities.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll the same, I reckon I\u2019ll go round there to-night and see if I can\u2019t\r\nginger them up to break through their silly rules.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will be quite useless, Mr. Hersheimmer.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe words came out like the crack of a pistol, and Tommy looked up with\r\na start. Julius was nervous and excited. The hand with which he raised\r\nhis glass to his lips shook slightly, but his eyes held Sir James\u2019s\r\ndefiantly. For a moment the hostility between the two seemed likely to\r\nburst into flame, but in the end Julius lowered his eyes, defeated.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor the moment, I reckon you\u2019re the boss.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said the other. \u201cWe will say ten o\u2019clock then?\u201d With\r\nconsummate ease of manner he turned to Tommy. \u201cI must confess, Mr.\r\nBeresford, that it was something of a surprise to me to see you here\r\nthis evening. The last I heard of you was that your friends were in\r\ngrave anxiety on your behalf. Nothing had been heard of you for\r\nsome days, and Miss Tuppence was inclined to think you had got into\r\ndifficulties.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI had, sir!\u201d Tommy grinned reminiscently. \u201cI was never in a tighter\r\nplace in my life.\u201d\r\n\r\nHelped out by questions from Sir James, he gave an abbreviated account\r\nof his adventures. The lawyer looked at him with renewed interest as he\r\nbrought the tale to a close.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou got yourself out of a tight place very well,\u201d he said gravely. \u201cI\r\ncongratulate you. You displayed a great deal of ingenuity and carried\r\nyour part through well.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy blushed, his face assuming a prawnlike hue at the praise.\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have got away but for the girl, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Sir James smiled a little. \u201cIt was lucky for you she happened\r\nto--er--take a fancy to you.\u201d Tommy appeared about to protest, but Sir\r\nJames went on. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about her being one of the gang, I\r\nsuppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not, sir. I thought perhaps they were keeping her there by\r\nforce, but the way she acted didn\u2019t fit in with that. You see, she went\r\nback to them when she could have got away.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir James nodded thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did she say? Something about wanting to be taken to Marguerite?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. I suppose she meant Mrs. Vandemeyer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe always signed herself Rita Vandemeyer. All her friends spoke of\r\nher as Rita. Still, I suppose the girl must have been in the habit of\r\ncalling her by her full name. And, at the moment she was crying out to\r\nher, Mrs. Vandemeyer was either dead or dying! Curious! There are one\r\nor two points that strike me as being obscure--their sudden change\r\nof attitude towards yourself, for instance. By the way, the house was\r\nraided, of course?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, but they\u2019d all cleared out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNaturally,\u201d said Sir James dryly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd not a clue left behind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder----\u201d The lawyer tapped the table thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nSomething in his voice made Tommy look up. Would this man\u2019s eyes have\r\nseen something where theirs had been blind? He spoke impulsively:\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish you\u2019d been there, sir, to go over the house!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish I had,\u201d said Sir James quietly. He sat for a moment in silence.\r\nThen he looked up. \u201cAnd since then? What have you been doing?\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment, Tommy stared at him. Then it dawned on him that of course\r\nthe lawyer did not know.\r\n\r\n\u201cI forgot that you didn\u2019t know about Tuppence,\u201d he said slowly. The\r\nsickening anxiety, forgotten for a while in the excitement of knowing\r\nJane Finn was found at last, swept over him again.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer laid down his knife and fork sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cHas anything happened to Miss Tuppence?\u201d His voice was keen-edged.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s disappeared,\u201d said Julius.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA week ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d\r\n\r\nSir James\u2019s questions fairly shot out. Between them Tommy and Julius\r\ngave the history of the last week and their futile search.\r\n\r\nSir James went at once to the root of the matter.\r\n\r\n\u201cA wire signed with your name? They knew enough of you both for that.\r\nThey weren\u2019t sure of how much you had learnt in that house. Their\r\nkidnapping of Miss Tuppence is the counter-move to your escape. If\r\nnecessary they could seal your lips with a threat of what might happen\r\nto her.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just what I thought, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir James looked at him keenly. \u201cYou had worked that out, had you? Not\r\nbad--not at all bad. The curious thing is that they certainly did not\r\nknow anything about you when they first held you prisoner. You are sure\r\nthat you did not in any way disclose your identity?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d said Julius with a nod. \u201cTherefore I reckon some one put\r\nthem wise--and not earlier than Sunday afternoon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but who?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat almighty omniscient Mr. Brown, of course!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a faint note of derision in the American\u2019s voice which made\r\nSir James look up sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe in Mr. Brown, Mr. Hersheimmer?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, I do not,\u201d returned the young American with emphasis. \u201cNot\r\nas such, that is to say. I reckon it out that he\u2019s a figurehead--just a\r\nbogy name to frighten the children with. The real head of this business\r\nis that Russian chap Kramenin. I guess he\u2019s quite capable of running\r\nrevolutions in three countries at once if he chose! The man Whittington\r\nis probably the head of the English branch.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI disagree with you,\u201d said Sir James shortly. \u201cMr. Brown exists.\u201d He\r\nturned to Tommy. \u201cDid you happen to notice where that wire was handed\r\nin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cH\u2019m. Got it with you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s upstairs, sir, in my kit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to have a look at it sometime. No hurry. You\u2019ve wasted a\r\nweek\u201d--Tommy hung his head--\u201ca day or so more is immaterial. We\u2019ll deal\r\nwith Miss Jane Finn first. Afterwards, we\u2019ll set to work to rescue Miss\r\nTuppence from bondage. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s in any immediate danger. That\r\nis, so long as they don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve got Jane Finn, and that\r\nher memory has returned. We must keep that dark at all costs. You\r\nunderstand?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe other two assented, and, after making arrangements for meeting on\r\nthe morrow, the great lawyer took his leave.\r\n\r\nAt ten o\u2019clock, the two young men were at the appointed spot. Sir\r\nJames had joined them on the doorstep. He alone appeared unexcited. He\r\nintroduced them to the doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Hersheimmer--Mr. Beresford--Dr. Roylance. How\u2019s the patient?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGoing on well. Evidently no idea of the flight of time. Asked this\r\nmorning how many had been saved from the _Lusitania_. Was it in the\r\npapers yet? That, of course, was only what was to be expected. She seems\r\nto have something on her mind, though.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think we can relieve her anxiety. May we go up?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy\u2019s heart beat sensibly faster as they followed the doctor upstairs.\r\nJane Finn at last! The long-sought, the mysterious, the elusive Jane\r\nFinn! How wildly improbable success had seemed! And here in this house,\r\nher memory almost miraculously restored, lay the girl who held the\r\nfuture of England in her hands. A half groan broke from Tommy\u2019s lips.\r\nIf only Tuppence could have been at his side to share in the triumphant\r\nconclusion of their joint venture! Then he put the thought of Tuppence\r\nresolutely aside. His confidence in Sir James was growing. There was\r\na man who would unerringly ferret out Tuppence\u2019s whereabouts. In the\r\nmeantime Jane Finn! And suddenly a dread clutched at his heart. It\r\nseemed too easy.... Suppose they should find her dead ... stricken down\r\nby the hand of Mr. Brown?\r\n\r\nIn another minute he was laughing at these melodramatic fancies. The\r\ndoctor held open the door of a room and they passed in. On the white\r\nbed, bandages round her head, lay the girl. Somehow the whole scene\r\nseemed unreal. It was so exactly what one expected that it gave the\r\neffect of being beautifully staged.\r\n\r\nThe girl looked from one to the other of them with large wondering eyes.\r\nSir James spoke first.\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Finn,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is your cousin, Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer.\u201d\r\n\r\nA faint flush flitted over the girl\u2019s face, as Julius stepped forward\r\nand took her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do, Cousin Jane?\u201d he said lightly.\r\n\r\nBut Tommy caught the tremor in his voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you really Uncle Hiram\u2019s son?\u201d she asked wonderingly.\r\n\r\nHer voice, with the slight warmth of the Western accent, had an almost\r\nthrilling quality. It seemed vaguely familiar to Tommy, but he thrust\r\nthe impression aside as impossible.\r\n\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe used to read about Uncle Hiram in the papers,\u201d continued the girl,\r\nin her low soft tones. \u201cBut I never thought I\u2019d meet you one day. Mother\r\nfigured it out that Uncle Hiram would never get over being mad with\r\nher.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe old man was like that,\u201d admitted Julius. \u201cBut I guess the new\r\ngeneration\u2019s sort of different. Got no use for the family feud business.\r\nFirst thing I thought about, soon as the war was over, was to come along\r\nand hunt you up.\u201d\r\n\r\nA shadow passed over the girl\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been telling me things--dreadful things--that my memory went,\r\nand that there are years I shall never know about--years lost out of my\r\nlife.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t realize that yourself?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl\u2019s eyes opened wide.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, no. It seems to me as though it were no time since we were being\r\nhustled into those boats. I can see it all now.\u201d She closed her eyes\r\nwith a shudder.\r\n\r\nJulius looked across at Sir James, who nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry any. It isn\u2019t worth it. Now, see here, Jane, there\u2019s\r\nsomething we want to know about. There was a man aboard that boat with\r\nsome mighty important papers on him, and the big guns in this country\r\nhave got a notion that he passed on the goods to you. Is that so?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl hesitated, her glance shifting to the other two. Julius\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Beresford is commissioned by the British Government to get those\r\npapers back. Sir James Peel Edgerton is an English Member of Parliament,\r\nand might be a big gun in the Cabinet if he liked. It\u2019s owing to him\r\nthat we\u2019ve ferreted you out at last. So you can go right ahead and tell\r\nus the whole story. Did Danvers give you the papers?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. He said they\u2019d have a better chance with me, because they would\r\nsave the women and children first.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJust as we thought,\u201d said Sir James.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe said they were very important--that they might make all the\r\ndifference to the Allies. But, if it\u2019s all so long ago, and the war\u2019s\r\nover, what does it matter now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess history repeats itself, Jane. First there was a great hue\r\nand cry over those papers, then it all died down, and now the whole\r\ncaboodle\u2019s started all over again--for rather different reasons. Then\r\nyou can hand them over to us right away?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou--haven\u2019t--got them?\u201d Julius punctuated the words with little\r\npauses.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo--I hid them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou _hid_ them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I got uneasy. People seemed to be watching me. It scared\r\nme--badly.\u201d She put her hand to her head. \u201cIt\u2019s almost the last thing I\r\nremember before waking up in the hospital....\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on,\u201d said Sir James, in his quiet penetrating tones. \u201cWhat do you\r\nremember?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe turned to him obediently.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was at Holyhead. I came that way--I don\u2019t remember why....\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. Go on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the confusion on the quay I slipped away. Nobody saw me. I took a\r\ncar. Told the man to drive me out of the town. I watched when we got on\r\nthe open road. No other car was following us. I saw a path at the side\r\nof the road. I told the man to wait.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe paused, then went on. \u201cThe path led to the cliff, and down to the\r\nsea between big yellow gorse bushes--they were like golden flames. I\r\nlooked round. There wasn\u2019t a soul in sight. But just level with my head\r\nthere was a hole in the rock. It was quite small--I could only just get\r\nmy hand in, but it went a long way back. I took the oilskin packet from\r\nround my neck and shoved it right in as far as I could. Then I tore off\r\na bit of gorse--My! but it did prick--and plugged the hole with it so\r\nthat you\u2019d never guess there was a crevice of any kind there. Then I\r\nmarked the place carefully in my own mind, so that I\u2019d find it again.\r\nThere was a queer boulder in the path just there--for all the world\r\nlike a dog sitting up begging. Then I went back to the road. The car was\r\nwaiting, and I drove back. I just caught the train. I was a bit ashamed\r\nof myself for fancying things maybe, but, by and by, I saw the man\r\nopposite me wink at a woman who was sitting next to me, and I felt\r\nscared again, and was glad the papers were safe. I went out in the\r\ncorridor to get a little air. I thought I\u2019d slip into another carriage.\r\nBut the woman called me back, said I\u2019d dropped something, and when I\r\nstooped to look, something seemed to hit me--here.\u201d She placed her hand\r\nto the back of her head. \u201cI don\u2019t remember anything more until I woke up\r\nin the hospital.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, Miss Finn.\u201d It was Sir James who spoke. \u201cI hope we have not\r\ntired you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s all right. My head aches a little, but otherwise I feel\r\nfine.\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius stepped forward and took her hand again.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo long, Cousin Jane. I\u2019m going to get busy after those papers, but\r\nI\u2019ll be back in two shakes of a dog\u2019s tail, and I\u2019ll tote you up to\r\nLondon and give you the time of your young life before we go back to the\r\nStates! I mean it--so hurry up and get well.\u201d\r\n\nIN the street they held an informal council of war. Sir James had drawn\r\na watch from his pocket. \u201cThe boat train to Holyhead stops at Chester at\r\n12.14. If you start at once I think you can catch the connection.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy looked up, puzzled.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs there any need to hurry, sir? To-day is only the 24th.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s always well to get up early in the morning,\u201d said Julius,\r\nbefore the lawyer had time to reply. \u201cWe\u2019ll make tracks for the depot\r\nright away.\u201d\r\n\r\nA little frown had settled on Sir James\u2019s brow.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish I could come with you. I am due to speak at a meeting at two\r\no\u2019clock. It is unfortunate.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe reluctance in his tone was very evident. It was clear, on the other\r\nhand, that Julius was easily disposed to put up with the loss of the\r\nother\u2019s company.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess there\u2019s nothing complicated about this deal,\u201d he remarked.\r\n\u201cJust a game of hide-and-seek, that\u2019s all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope so,\u201d said Sir James.\r\n\r\n\u201cSure thing. What else could it be?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are still young, Mr. Hersheimmer. At my age you will probably have\r\nlearnt one lesson. \u2018Never underestimate your adversary.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nThe gravity of his tone impressed Tommy, but had little effect upon\r\nJulius.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think Mr. Brown might come along and take a hand? If he does, I\u2019m\r\nready for him.\u201d He slapped his pocket. \u201cI carry a gun. Little Willie\r\nhere travels round with me everywhere.\u201d He produced a murderous-looking\r\nautomatic, and tapped it affectionately before returning it to its\r\nhome. \u201cBut he won\u2019t be needed this trip. There\u2019s nobody to put Mr. Brown\r\nwise.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe lawyer shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was nobody to put Mr. Brown wise to the fact that Mrs. Vandemeyer\r\nmeant to betray him. Nevertheless, _Mrs. Vandemeyer died without\r\nspeaking_.\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius was silenced for once, and Sir James added on a lighter note:\r\n\r\n\u201cI only want to put you on your guard. Good-bye, and good luck. Take\r\nno unnecessary risks once the papers are in your hands. If there is any\r\nreason to believe that you have been shadowed, destroy them at once.\r\nGood luck to you. The game is in your hands now.\u201d He shook hands with\r\nthem both.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later the two young men were seated in a first-class\r\ncarriage _en route_ for Chester.\r\n\r\nFor a long time neither of them spoke. When at length Julius broke the\r\nsilence, it was with a totally unexpected remark.\r\n\r\n\u201cSay,\u201d he observed thoughtfully, \u201cdid you ever make a darned fool of\r\nyourself over a girl\u2019s face?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy, after a moment\u2019s astonishment, searched his mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t say I have,\u201d he replied at last. \u201cNot that I can recollect,\r\nanyhow. Why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause for the last two months I\u2019ve been making a sentimental idiot of\r\nmyself over Jane! First moment I clapped eyes on her photograph my heart\r\ndid all the usual stunts you read about in novels. I guess I\u2019m ashamed\r\nto admit it, but I came over here determined to find her and fix it all\r\nup, and take her back as Mrs. Julius P. Hersheimmer!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Tommy, amazed.\r\n\r\nJulius uncrossed his legs brusquely and continued:\r\n\r\n\u201cJust shows what an almighty fool a man can make of himself! One look at\r\nthe girl in the flesh, and I was cured!\u201d\r\n\r\nFeeling more tongue-tied than ever, Tommy ejaculated \u201cOh!\u201d again.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo disparagement to Jane, mind you,\u201d continued the other. \u201cShe\u2019s a real\r\nnice girl, and some fellow will fall in love with her right away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought her a very good-looking girl,\u201d said Tommy, finding his\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\n\u201cSure she is. But she\u2019s not like her photo one bit. At least I suppose\r\nshe is in a way--must be--because I recognized her right off. If I\u2019d\r\nseen her in a crowd I\u2019d have said \u2018There\u2019s a girl whose face I know\u2019\r\nright away without any hesitation. But there was something about that\r\nphoto\u201d--Julius shook his head, and heaved a sigh--\u201cI guess romance is a\r\nmighty queer thing!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must be,\u201d said Tommy coldly, \u201cif you can come over here in love with\r\none girl, and propose to another within a fortnight.\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius had the grace to look discomposed.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you see, I\u2019d got a sort of tired feeling that I\u2019d never find\r\nJane--and that it was all plumb foolishness anyway. And then--oh, well,\r\nthe French, for instance, are much more sensible in the way they look at\r\nthings. They keep romance and marriage apart----\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy flushed.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m damned! If that\u2019s----\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius hastened to interrupt.\r\n\r\n\u201cSay now, don\u2019t be hasty. I don\u2019t mean what you mean. I take it\r\nAmericans have a higher opinion of morality than you have even. What I\r\nmeant was that the French set about marriage in a businesslike way--find\r\ntwo people who are suited to one another, look after the money affairs,\r\nand see the whole thing practically, and in a businesslike spirit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you ask me,\u201d said Tommy, \u201cwe\u2019re all too damned businesslike\r\nnowadays. We\u2019re always saying, \u2018Will it pay?\u2019 The men are bad enough,\r\nand the girls are worse!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCool down, son. Don\u2019t get so heated.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI feel heated,\u201d said Tommy.\r\n\r\nJulius looked at him and judged it wise to say no more.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tommy had plenty of time to cool down before they reached\r\nHolyhead, and the cheerful grin had returned to his countenance as they\r\nalighted at their destination.\r\n\r\nAfter consultation, and with the aid of a road map, they were fairly\r\nwell agreed as to direction, so were able to hire a taxi without more\r\nado and drive out on the road leading to Treaddur Bay. They instructed\r\nthe man to go slowly, and watched narrowly so as not to miss the path.\r\nThey came to it not long after leaving the town, and Tommy stopped the\r\ncar promptly, asked in a casual tone whether the path led down to the\r\nsea, and hearing it did paid off the man in handsome style.\r\n\r\nA moment later the taxi was slowly chugging back to Holyhead. Tommy and\r\nJulius watched it out of sight, and then turned to the narrow path.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the right one, I suppose?\u201d asked Tommy doubtfully. \u201cThere must be\r\nsimply heaps along here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure it is. Look at the gorse. Remember what Jane said?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy looked at the swelling hedges of golden blossom which bordered the\r\npath on either side, and was convinced.\r\n\r\nThey went down in single file, Julius leading. Twice Tommy turned his\r\nhead uneasily. Julius looked back.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve got the wind up somehow. Keep fancying there\u2019s some\r\none following us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t be,\u201d said Julius positively. \u201cWe\u2019d see him.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy had to admit that this was true. Nevertheless, his sense of\r\nuneasiness deepened. In spite of himself he believed in the omniscience\r\nof the enemy.\r\n\r\n\u201cI rather wish that fellow would come along,\u201d said Julius. He patted his\r\npocket. \u201cLittle William here is just aching for exercise!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you always carry it--him--with you?\u201d inquired Tommy with burning\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n\u201cMost always. I guess you never know what might turn up.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy kept a respectful silence. He was impressed by little William. It\r\nseemed to remove the menace of Mr. Brown farther away.\r\n\r\nThe path was now running along the side of the cliff, parallel to the\r\nsea. Suddenly Julius came to such an abrupt halt that Tommy cannoned\r\ninto him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook there. If that doesn\u2019t beat the band!\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy looked. Standing out half obstructing the path was a huge boulder\r\nwhich certainly bore a fanciful resemblance to a \u201cbegging\u201d terrier.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Tommy, refusing to share Julius\u2019s emotion, \u201cit\u2019s what we\r\nexpected to see, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius looked at him sadly and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cBritish phlegm! Sure we expected it--but it kind of rattles me, all the\r\nsame, to see it sitting there just where we expected to find it!\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy, whose calm was, perhaps, more assumed than natural, moved his\r\nfeet impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cPush on. What about the hole?\u201d\r\n\r\nThey scanned the cliff-side narrowly. Tommy heard himself saying\r\nidiotically:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe gorse won\u2019t be there after all these years.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd Julius replied solemnly:\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re right.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy suddenly pointed with a shaking hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about that crevice there?\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius replied in an awestricken voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it--for sure.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I was in France,\u201d said Tommy reminiscently, \u201cwhenever my batman\r\nfailed to call me, he always said that he had come over queer. I never\r\nbelieved it. But whether he felt it or not, there _is_ such a sensation.\r\nI\u2019ve got it now! Badly!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked at the rock with a kind of agonized passion.\r\n\r\n\u201cDamn it!\u201d he cried. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible! Five years! Think of it!\r\nBird\u2019s-nesting boys, picnic parties, thousands of people passing! It\r\ncan\u2019t be there! It\u2019s a hundred to one against its being there! It\u2019s\r\nagainst all reason!\u201d\r\n\r\nIndeed, he felt it to be impossible--more, perhaps, because he could not\r\nbelieve in his own success where so many others had failed. The thing\r\nwas too easy, therefore it could not be. The hole would be empty.\r\n\r\nJulius looked at him with a widening smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re rattled now all right,\u201d he drawled with some enjoyment.\r\n\u201cWell, here goes!\u201d He thrust his hand into the crevice, and made a\r\nslight grimace. \u201cIt\u2019s a tight fit. Jane\u2019s hand must be a few sizes\r\nsmaller than mine. I don\u2019t feel anything--no--say, what\u2019s this? Gee\r\nwhiz!\u201d And with a flourish he waved aloft a small discoloured packet.\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the goods all right. Sewn up in oilskin. Hold it while I get my\r\npenknife.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe unbelievable had happened. Tommy held the precious packet tenderly\r\nbetween his hands. They had succeeded!\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s queer,\u201d he murmured idly, \u201cyou\u2019d think the stitches would have\r\nrotted. They look just as good as new.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey cut them carefully and ripped away the oilskin. Inside was a small\r\nfolded sheet of paper. With trembling fingers they unfolded it. The\r\nsheet was blank! They stared at each other, puzzled.\r\n\r\n\u201cA dummy?\u201d hazarded Julius. \u201cWas Danvers just a decoy?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy shook his head. That solution did not satisfy him. Suddenly his\r\nface cleared.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it! _Sympathetic ink!_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWorth trying anyhow. Heat usually does the trick. Get some sticks.\r\nWe\u2019ll make a fire.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the little fire of twigs and leaves was blazing\r\nmerrily. Tommy held the sheet of paper near the glow. The paper curled a\r\nlittle with the heat. Nothing more.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Julius grasped his arm, and pointed to where characters were\r\nappearing in a faint brown colour.\r\n\r\n\u201cGee whiz! You\u2019ve got it! Say, that idea of yours was great. It never\r\noccurred to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy held the paper in position some minutes longer until he judged the\r\nheat had done its work. Then he withdrew it. A moment later he uttered a\r\ncry.\r\n\r\nAcross the sheet in neat brown printing ran the words: WITH THE\r\nCOMPLIMENTS OF MR. BROWN.\r\n\nFOR a moment or two they stood staring at each other stupidly, dazed\r\nwith the shock. Somehow, inexplicably, Mr. Brown had forestalled them.\r\nTommy accepted defeat quietly. Not so Julius.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow in tarnation did he get ahead of us? That\u2019s what beats me!\u201d he\r\nended up.\r\n\r\nTommy shook his head, and said dully:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt accounts for the stitches being new. We might have guessed....\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind the darned stitches. How did he get ahead of us? We hustled\r\nall we knew. It\u2019s downright impossible for anyone to get here quicker\r\nthan we did. And, anyway, how did he know? Do you reckon there was a\r\ndictaphone in Jane\u2019s room? I guess there must have been.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Tommy\u2019s common sense pointed out objections.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo one could have known beforehand that she was going to be in that\r\nhouse--much less that particular room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d admitted Julius. \u201cThen one of the nurses was a crook and\r\nlistened at the door. How\u2019s that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that it matters anyway,\u201d said Tommy wearily. \u201cHe may have\r\nfound out some months ago, and removed the papers, then----No, by Jove,\r\nthat won\u2019t wash! They\u2019d have been published at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure thing they would! No, some one\u2019s got ahead of us to-day by an hour\r\nor so. But how they did it gets my goat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish that chap Peel Edgerton had been with us,\u201d said Tommy\r\nthoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Julius stared. \u201cThe mischief was done when we came.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes----\u201d Tommy hesitated. He could not explain his own feeling--the\r\nillogical idea that the K.C.\u2019s presence would somehow have averted the\r\ncatastrophe. He reverted to his former point of view. \u201cIt\u2019s no good\r\narguing about how it was done. The game\u2019s up. We\u2019ve failed. There\u2019s only\r\none thing for me to do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGet back to London as soon as possible. Mr. Carter must be warned. It\u2019s\r\nonly a matter of hours now before the blow falls. But, at any rate, he\r\nought to know the worst.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe duty was an unpleasant one, but Tommy had no intention of shirking\r\nit. He must report his failure to Mr. Carter. After that his work was\r\ndone. He took the midnight mail to London. Julius elected to stay the\r\nnight at Holyhead.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour after arrival, haggard and pale, Tommy stood before his\r\nchief.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to report, sir. I\u2019ve failed--failed badly.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Carter eyed him sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean that the treaty----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs in the hands of Mr. Brown, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Mr. Carter quietly. The expression on his face did not\r\nchange, but Tommy caught the flicker of despair in his eyes. It\r\nconvinced him as nothing else had done that the outlook was hopeless.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Mr. Carter after a minute or two, \u201cwe mustn\u2019t sag at the\r\nknees, I suppose. I\u2019m glad to know definitely. We must do what we can.\u201d\r\n\r\nThrough Tommy\u2019s mind flashed the assurance: \u201cIt\u2019s hopeless, and he knows\r\nit\u2019s hopeless!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe other looked up at him.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t take it to heart, lad,\u201d he said kindly. \u201cYou did your best. You\r\nwere up against one of the biggest brains of the century. And you came\r\nvery near success. Remember that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, sir. It\u2019s awfully decent of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI blame myself. I have been blaming myself ever since I heard this\r\nother news.\u201d\r\n\r\nSomething in his tone attracted Tommy\u2019s attention. A new fear gripped at\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs there--something more, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so,\u201d said Mr. Carter gravely. He stretched out his hand to a\r\nsheet on the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cTuppence----?\u201d faltered Tommy.\r\n\r\n\u201cRead for yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe typewritten words danced before his eyes. The description of a green\r\ntoque, a coat with a handkerchief in the pocket marked P.L.C. He looked\r\nan agonized question at Mr. Carter. The latter replied to it:\r\n\r\n\u201cWashed up on the Yorkshire coast--near Ebury. I\u2019m afraid--it looks very\r\nmuch like foul play.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God!\u201d gasped Tommy. \u201c_Tuppence!_ Those devils--I\u2019ll never rest till\r\nI\u2019ve got even with them! I\u2019ll hunt them down! I\u2019ll----\u201d\r\n\r\nThe pity on Mr. Carter\u2019s face stopped him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know what you feel like, my poor boy. But it\u2019s no good. You\u2019ll waste\r\nyour strength uselessly. It may sound harsh, but my advice to you is:\r\nCut your losses. Time\u2019s merciful. You\u2019ll forget.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cForget Tuppence? Never!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Carter shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you think now. Well, it won\u2019t bear thinking of--that brave little\r\ngirl! I\u2019m sorry about the whole business--confoundedly sorry.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy came to himself with a start.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m taking up your time, sir,\u201d he said with an effort. \u201cThere\u2019s no need\r\nfor you to blame yourself. I dare say we were a couple of young fools to\r\ntake on such a job. You warned us all right. But I wish to God I\u2019d been\r\nthe one to get it in the neck. Good-bye, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nBack at the _Ritz_, Tommy packed up his few belongings mechanically,\r\nhis thoughts far away. He was still bewildered by the introduction of\r\ntragedy into his cheerful commonplace existence. What fun they had\r\nhad together, he and Tuppence! And now--oh, he couldn\u2019t believe it--it\r\ncouldn\u2019t be true! _Tuppence--dead!_ Little Tuppence, brimming over with\r\nlife! It was a dream, a horrible dream. Nothing more.\r\n\r\nThey brought him a note, a few kind words of sympathy from Peel\r\nEdgerton, who had read the news in the paper. (There had been a large\r\nheadline: EX-V.A.D. FEARED DROWNED.) The letter ended with the offer\r\nof a post on a ranch in the Argentine, where Sir James had considerable\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\u201cKind old beggar,\u201d muttered Tommy, as he flung it aside.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and Julius burst in with his usual violence. He held an\r\nopen newspaper in his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cSay, what\u2019s all this? They seem to have got some fool idea about\r\nTuppence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d said Tommy quietly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean they\u2019ve done her in?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose when they got the treaty she--wasn\u2019t any good to them any\r\nlonger, and they were afraid to let her go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m darned!\u201d said Julius. \u201cLittle Tuppence. She sure was the\r\npluckiest little girl----\u201d\r\n\r\nBut suddenly something seemed to crack in Tommy\u2019s brain. He rose to his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, get out! You don\u2019t really care, damn you! You asked her to marry\r\nyou in your rotten cold-blooded way, but I _loved_ her. I\u2019d have given\r\nthe soul out of my body to save her from harm. I\u2019d have stood by without\r\na word and let her marry you, because you could have given her the sort\r\nof time she ought to have had, and I was only a poor devil without a\r\npenny to bless himself with. But it wouldn\u2019t have been because I didn\u2019t\r\ncare!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSee here,\u201d began Julius temperately.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, go to the devil! I can\u2019t stand your coming here and talking about\r\n\u2018little Tuppence.\u2019 Go and look after your cousin. Tuppence is my girl!\r\nI\u2019ve always loved her, from the time we played together as kids. We\r\ngrew up and it was just the same. I shall never forget when I was in\r\nhospital, and she came in in that ridiculous cap and apron! It was like\r\na miracle to see the girl I loved turn up in a nurse\u2019s kit----\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Julius interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\u201cA nurse\u2019s kit! Gee whiz! I must be going to Colney Hatch! I could swear\r\nI\u2019ve seen Jane in a nurse\u2019s cap too. And that\u2019s plumb impossible! No,\r\nby gum, I\u2019ve got it! It was her I saw talking to Whittington at that\r\nnursing home in Bournemouth. She wasn\u2019t a patient there! She was a\r\nnurse!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI dare say,\u201d said Tommy angrily, \u201cshe\u2019s probably been in with them from\r\nthe start. I shouldn\u2019t wonder if she stole those papers from Danvers to\r\nbegin with.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m darned if she did!\u201d shouted Julius. \u201cShe\u2019s my cousin, and as\r\npatriotic a girl as ever stepped.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care a damn what she is, but get out of here!\u201d retorted Tommy\r\nalso at the top of his voice.\r\n\r\nThe young men were on the point of coming to blows. But suddenly, with\r\nan almost magical abruptness, Julius\u2019s anger abated.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right, son,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cI\u2019m going. I don\u2019t blame you any for\r\nwhat you\u2019ve been saying. It\u2019s mighty lucky you did say it. I\u2019ve been\r\nthe most almighty blithering darned idiot that it\u2019s possible to imagine.\r\nCalm down\u201d--Tommy had made an impatient gesture--\u201cI\u2019m going right away\r\nnow--going to the London and North Western Railway depot, if you want to\r\nknow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care a damn where you\u2019re going,\u201d growled Tommy.\r\n\r\nAs the door closed behind Julius, he returned to his suit-case.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the lot,\u201d he murmured, and rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\u201cTake my luggage down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. Going away, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to the devil,\u201d said Tommy, regardless of the menial\u2019s\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\nThat functionary, however, merely replied respectfully:\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. Shall I call a taxi?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy nodded.\r\n\r\nWhere was he going? He hadn\u2019t the faintest idea. Beyond a fixed\r\ndetermination to get even with Mr. Brown he had no plans. He re-read Sir\r\nJames\u2019s letter, and shook his head. Tuppence must be avenged. Still, it\r\nwas kind of the old fellow.\r\n\r\n\u201cBetter answer it, I suppose.\u201d He went across to the writing-table.\r\nWith the usual perversity of bedroom stationery, there were innumerable\r\nenvelopes and no paper. He rang. No one came. Tommy fumed at the\r\ndelay. Then he remembered that there was a good supply in Julius\u2019s\r\nsitting-room. The American had announced his immediate departure, there\r\nwould be no fear of running up against him. Besides, he wouldn\u2019t mind if\r\nhe did. He was beginning to be rather ashamed of the things he had said.\r\nOld Julius had taken them jolly well. He\u2019d apologize if he found him\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nBut the room was deserted. Tommy walked across to the writing-table,\r\nand opened the middle drawer. A photograph, carelessly thrust in face\r\nupwards, caught his eye. For a moment he stood rooted to the ground.\r\nThen he took it out, shut the drawer, walked slowly over to an\r\narm-chair, and sat down still staring at the photograph in his hand.\r\n\r\nWhat on earth was a photograph of the French girl Annette doing in\r\nJulius Hersheimmer\u2019s writing-table?\r\n\nTHE Prime Minister tapped the desk in front of him with nervous fingers.\r\nHis face was worn and harassed. He took up his conversation with Mr.\r\nCarter at the point it had broken off. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said.\r\n\u201cDo you really mean that things are not so desperate after all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo this lad seems to think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s have a look at his letter again.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Carter handed it over. It was written in a sprawling boyish hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cDEAR MR. CARTER,\r\n\r\n\u201cSomething\u2019s turned up that has given me a jar. Of course I may be\r\nsimply making an awful ass of myself, but I don\u2019t think so. If my\r\nconclusions are right, that girl at Manchester was just a plant. The\r\nwhole thing was prearranged, sham packet and all, with the object of\r\nmaking us think the game was up--therefore I fancy that we must have\r\nbeen pretty hot on the scent.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I know who the real Jane Finn is, and I\u2019ve even got an idea\r\nwhere the papers are. That last\u2019s only a guess, of course, but I\u2019ve a\r\nsort of feeling it\u2019ll turn out right. Anyhow, I enclose it in a sealed\r\nenvelope for what it\u2019s worth. I\u2019m going to ask you not to open it until\r\nthe very last moment, midnight on the 28th, in fact. You\u2019ll understand\r\nwhy in a minute. You see, I\u2019ve figured it out that those things of\r\nTuppence\u2019s are a plant too, and she\u2019s no more drowned than I am. The way\r\nI reason is this: as a last chance they\u2019ll let Jane Finn escape in\r\nthe hope that she\u2019s been shamming this memory stunt, and that once she\r\nthinks she\u2019s free she\u2019ll go right away to the cache. Of course it\u2019s\r\nan awful risk for them to take, because she knows all about them--but\r\nthey\u2019re pretty desperate to get hold of that treaty. _But if they know\r\nthat the papers have been recovered by us_, neither of those two girls\u2019\r\nlives will be worth an hour\u2019s purchase. I must try and get hold of\r\nTuppence before Jane escapes.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want a repeat of that telegram that was sent to Tuppence at the\r\n_Ritz_. Sir James Peel Edgerton said you would be able to manage that\r\nfor me. He\u2019s frightfully clever.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne last thing--please have that house in Soho watched day and night.\r\n\r\n\u201cYours, etc.,\r\n\r\n\u201cTHOMAS BERESFORD.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister looked up.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe enclosure?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Carter smiled dryly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the vaults of the Bank. I am taking no chances.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think\u201d--the Prime Minister hesitated a minute--\u201cthat it would\r\nbe better to open it now? Surely we ought to secure the document, that\r\nis, provided the young man\u2019s guess turns out to be correct, at once. We\r\ncan keep the fact of having done so quite secret.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan we? I\u2019m not so sure. There are spies all round us. Once it\u2019s known\r\nI wouldn\u2019t give that\u201d--he snapped his fingers--\u201cfor the life of those\r\ntwo girls. No, the boy trusted me, and I shan\u2019t let him down.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well, we must leave it at that, then. What\u2019s he like, this lad?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOutwardly, he\u2019s an ordinary clean-limbed, rather block-headed young\r\nEnglishman. Slow in his mental processes. On the other hand, it\u2019s quite\r\nimpossible to lead him astray through his imagination. He hasn\u2019t got\r\nany--so he\u2019s difficult to deceive. He worries things out slowly, and\r\nonce he\u2019s got hold of anything he doesn\u2019t let go. The little lady\u2019s\r\nquite different. More intuition and less common sense. They make a\r\npretty pair working together. Pace and stamina.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe seems confident,\u201d mused the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, and that\u2019s what gives me hope. He\u2019s the kind of diffident youth\r\nwho would have to be _very_ sure before he ventured an opinion at all.\u201d\r\n\r\nA half smile came to the other\u2019s lips.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd it is this--boy who will defeat the master criminal of our time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis--boy, as you say! But I sometimes fancy I see a shadow behind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPeel Edgerton.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPeel Edgerton?\u201d said the Prime Minister in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I see his hand in _this_.\u201d He struck the open letter. \u201cHe\u2019s\r\nthere--working in the dark, silently, unobtrusively. I\u2019ve always felt\r\nthat if anyone was to run Mr. Brown to earth, Peel Edgerton would be the\r\nman. I tell you he\u2019s on the case now, but doesn\u2019t want it known. By the\r\nway, I got rather an odd request from him the other day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe sent me a cutting from some American paper. It referred to a man\u2019s\r\nbody found near the docks in New York about three weeks ago. He asked me\r\nto collect any information on the subject I could.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d\r\n\r\nCarter shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t get much. Young fellow about thirty-five--poorly\r\ndressed--face very badly disfigured. He was never identified.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you fancy that the two matters are connected in some way?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSomehow I do. I may be wrong, of course.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, then Mr. Carter continued:\r\n\r\n\u201cI asked him to come round here. Not that we\u2019ll get anything out of him\r\nhe doesn\u2019t want to tell. His legal instincts are too strong. But there\u2019s\r\nno doubt he can throw light on one or two obscure points in young\r\nBeresford\u2019s letter. Ah, here he is!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe two men rose to greet the new-comer. A half whimsical thought\r\nflashed across the Premier\u2019s mind. \u201cMy successor, perhaps!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a letter from young Beresford,\u201d said Mr. Carter, coming to\r\nthe point at once. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen him, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou suppose wrong,\u201d said the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Mr. Carter was a little nonplussed.\r\n\r\nSir James smiled, and stroked his chin.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe rang me up,\u201d he volunteered.\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you have any objection to telling us exactly what passed between\r\nyou?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. He thanked me for a certain letter which I had written to\r\nhim--as a matter of fact, I had offered him a job. Then he reminded\r\nme of something I had said to him at Manchester respecting that bogus\r\ntelegram which lured Miss Cowley away. I asked him if anything untoward\r\nhad occurred. He said it had--that in a drawer in Mr. Hersheimmer\u2019s room\r\nhe had discovered a photograph.\u201d The lawyer paused, then continued: \u201cI\r\nasked him if the photograph bore the name and address of a Californian\r\nphotographer. He replied: \u2018You\u2019re on to it, sir. It had.\u2019 Then he went\r\non to tell me something I _didn\u2019t_ know. The original of that photograph\r\nwas the French girl, Annette, who saved his life.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. I asked the young man with some curiosity what he had done\r\nwith the photograph. He replied that he had put it back where he found\r\nit.\u201d The lawyer paused again. \u201cThat was good, you know--distinctly\r\ngood. He can use his brains, that young fellow. I congratulated him. The\r\ndiscovery was a providential one. Of course, from the moment that the\r\ngirl in Manchester was proved to be a plant everything was altered.\r\nYoung Beresford saw that for himself without my having to tell it\r\nhim. But he felt he couldn\u2019t trust his judgment on the subject of\r\nMiss Cowley. Did I think she was alive? I told him, duly weighing the\r\nevidence, that there was a very decided chance in favour of it. That\r\nbrought us back to the telegram.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI advised him to apply to you for a copy of the original wire. It\r\nhad occurred to me as probable that, after Miss Cowley flung it on the\r\nfloor, certain words might have been erased and altered with the express\r\nintention of setting searchers on a false trail.\u201d\r\n\r\nCarter nodded. He took a sheet from his pocket, and read aloud:\r\n\r\n\u201cCome at once, Astley Priors, Gatehouse, Kent. Great\r\ndevelopments--TOMMY.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery simple,\u201d said Sir James, \u201cand very ingenious. Just a few words\r\nto alter, and the thing was done. And the one important clue they\r\noverlooked.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe page-boy\u2019s statement that Miss Cowley drove to Charing Cross. They\r\nwere so sure of themselves that they took it for granted he had made a\r\nmistake.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen young Beresford is now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt Gatehouse, Kent, unless I am much mistaken.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Carter looked at him curiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cI rather wonder you\u2019re not there too, Peel Edgerton?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, I\u2019m busy on a case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you were on your holiday?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ve not been briefed. Perhaps it would be more correct to say I\u2019m\r\npreparing a case. Any more facts about that American chap for me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not. Is it important to find out who he was?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I know who he was,\u201d said Sir James easily. \u201cI can\u2019t prove it\r\nyet--but I know.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe other two asked no questions. They had an instinct that it would be\r\nmere waste of breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what I don\u2019t understand,\u201d said the Prime-Minister suddenly, \u201cis how\r\nthat photograph came to be in Mr. Hersheimmer\u2019s drawer?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps it never left it,\u201d suggested the lawyer gently.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the bogus inspector? Inspector Brown?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Sir James thoughtfully. He rose to his feet. \u201cI mustn\u2019t keep\r\nyou. Go on with the affairs of the nation. I must get back to--my case.\u201d\r\n\r\nTwo days later Julius Hersheimmer returned from Manchester. A note from\r\nTommy lay on his table:\r\n\r\n\u201cDEAR HERSHEIMMER,\r\n\r\n\u201cSorry I lost my temper. In case I don\u2019t see you again, good-bye. I\u2019ve\r\nbeen offered a job in the Argentine, and might as well take it.\r\n\r\n\u201cYours,\r\n\r\n\u201cTOMMY BERESFORD.\u201d\r\n\r\nA peculiar smile lingered for a moment on Julius\u2019s face. He threw the\r\nletter into the waste-paper basket.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe darned fool!\u201d he murmured.\r\n\nAFTER ringing up Sir James, Tommy\u2019s next procedure was to make a call\r\nat South Audley Mansions. He found Albert discharging his professional\r\nduties, and introduced himself without more ado as a friend of\r\nTuppence\u2019s. Albert unbent immediately.\r\n\r\n\u201cThings has been very quiet here lately,\u201d he said wistfully. \u201cHope the\r\nyoung lady\u2019s keeping well, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the point, Albert. She\u2019s disappeared.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean as the crooks have got her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the Underworld?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, dash it all, in this world!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a h\u2019expression, sir,\u201d explained Albert. \u201cAt the pictures the\r\ncrooks always have a restoorant in the Underworld. But do you think as\r\nthey\u2019ve done her in, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope not. By the way, have you by any chance an aunt, a cousin,\r\na grandmother, or any other suitable female relation who might be\r\nrepresented as being likely to kick the bucket?\u201d\r\n\r\nA delighted grin spread slowly over Albert\u2019s countenance.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m on, sir. My poor aunt what lives in the country has been mortal bad\r\nfor a long time, and she\u2019s asking for me with her dying breath.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy nodded approval.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you report this in the proper quarter and meet me at Charing Cross\r\nin an hour\u2019s time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there, sir. You can count on me.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Tommy had judged, the faithful Albert proved an invaluable ally. The\r\ntwo took up their quarters at the inn in Gatehouse. To Albert fell the\r\ntask of collecting information. There was no difficulty about it.\r\n\r\nAstley Priors was the property of a Dr. Adams. The doctor no longer\r\npracticed, had retired, the landlord believed, but he took a few private\r\npatients--here the good fellow tapped his forehead knowingly--\u201cbalmy\r\nones! You understand!\u201d The doctor was a popular figure in the village,\r\nsubscribed freely to all the local sports--\u201ca very pleasant, affable\r\ngentleman.\u201d Been there long? Oh, a matter of ten years or so--might be\r\nlonger. Scientific gentleman, he was. Professors and people often came\r\ndown from town to see him. Anyway, it was a gay house, always visitors.\r\n\r\nIn the face of all this volubility, Tommy felt doubts. Was it possible\r\nthat this genial, well-known figure could be in reality a dangerous\r\ncriminal? His life seemed so open and aboveboard. No hint of sinister\r\ndoings. Suppose it was all a gigantic mistake? Tommy felt a cold chill\r\nat the thought.\r\n\r\nThen he remembered the private patients--\u201cbalmy ones.\u201d He inquired\r\ncarefully if there was a young lady amongst them, describing Tuppence.\r\nBut nothing much seemed to be known about the patients--they were seldom\r\nseen outside the grounds. A guarded description of Annette also failed\r\nto provoke recognition.\r\n\r\nAstley Priors was a pleasant red-brick edifice, surrounded by\r\nwell-wooded grounds which effectually shielded the house from\r\nobservation from the road.\r\n\r\nOn the first evening Tommy, accompanied by Albert, explored the grounds.\r\nOwing to Albert\u2019s insistence they dragged themselves along painfully on\r\ntheir stomachs, thereby producing a great deal more noise than if\r\nthey had stood upright. In any case, these precautions were totally\r\nunnecessary. The grounds, like those of any other private house after\r\nnightfall, seemed untenanted. Tommy had imagined a possible fierce\r\nwatchdog. Albert\u2019s fancy ran to a puma, or a tame cobra. But they\r\nreached a shrubbery near the house quite unmolested.\r\n\r\nThe blinds of the dining-room window were up. There was a large company\r\nassembled round the table. The port was passing from hand to hand. It\r\nseemed a normal, pleasant company. Through the open window scraps of\r\nconversation floated out disjointedly on the night air. It was a heated\r\ndiscussion on county cricket!\r\n\r\nAgain Tommy felt that cold chill of uncertainty. It seemed impossible\r\nto believe that these people were other than they seemed. Had he been\r\nfooled once more? The fair-bearded, spectacled gentleman who sat at the\r\nhead of the table looked singularly honest and normal.\r\n\r\nTommy slept badly that night. The following morning the indefatigable\r\nAlbert, having cemented an alliance with the greengrocer\u2019s boy, took the\r\nlatter\u2019s place and ingratiated himself with the cook at Malthouse.\r\nHe returned with the information that she was undoubtedly \u201cone of\r\nthe crooks,\u201d but Tommy mistrusted the vividness of his imagination.\r\nQuestioned, he could adduce nothing in support of his statement except\r\nhis own opinion that she wasn\u2019t the usual kind. You could see that at a\r\nglance.\r\n\r\nThe substitution being repeated (much to the pecuniary advantage of the\r\nreal greengrocer\u2019s boy) on the following day, Albert brought back the\r\nfirst piece of hopeful news. There _was_ a French young lady staying\r\nin the house. Tommy put his doubts aside. Here was confirmation of\r\nhis theory. But time pressed. To-day was the 27th. The 29th was the\r\nmuch-talked-of \u201cLabour Day,\u201d about which all sorts of rumours were\r\nrunning riot. Newspapers were getting agitated. Sensational hints of a\r\nLabour _coup d\u2019\u00e9tat_ were freely reported. The Government said nothing.\r\nIt knew and was prepared. There were rumours of dissension among the\r\nLabour leaders. They were not of one mind. The more far-seeing among\r\nthem realized that what they proposed might well be a death-blow to the\r\nEngland that at heart they loved. They shrank from the starvation and\r\nmisery a general strike would entail, and were willing to meet the\r\nGovernment half-way. But behind them were subtle, insistent forces at\r\nwork, urging the memories of old wrongs, deprecating the weakness of\r\nhalf-and-half measures, fomenting misunderstandings.\r\n\r\nTommy felt that, thanks to Mr. Carter, he understood the position fairly\r\naccurately. With the fatal document in the hands of Mr. Brown,\r\npublic opinion would swing to the side of the Labour extremists and\r\nrevolutionists. Failing that, the battle was an even chance. The\r\nGovernment with a loyal army and police force behind them might\r\nwin--but at a cost of great suffering. But Tommy nourished another and\r\na preposterous dream. With Mr. Brown unmasked and captured he\r\nbelieved, rightly or wrongly, that the whole organization would crumble\r\nignominiously and instantaneously. The strange permeating influence\r\nof the unseen chief held it together. Without him, Tommy believed an\r\ninstant panic would set in; and, the honest men left to themselves, an\r\neleventh-hour reconciliation would be possible.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a one-man show,\u201d said Tommy to himself. \u201cThe thing to do is to\r\nget hold of the man.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was partly in furtherance of this ambitious design that he had\r\nrequested Mr. Carter not to open the sealed envelope. The draft\r\ntreaty was Tommy\u2019s bait. Every now and then he was aghast at his own\r\npresumption. How dared he think that he had discovered what so many\r\nwiser and clever men had overlooked? Nevertheless, he stuck tenaciously\r\nto his idea.\r\n\r\nThat evening he and Albert once more penetrated the grounds of Astley\r\nPriors. Tommy\u2019s ambition was somehow or other to gain admission to the\r\nhouse itself. As they approached cautiously, Tommy gave a sudden gasp.\r\n\r\nOn the second floor window some one standing between the window and\r\nthe light in the room threw a silhouette on the blind. It was one Tommy\r\nwould have recognized anywhere! Tuppence was in that house!\r\n\r\nHe clutched Albert by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201cStay here! When I begin to sing, watch that window.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe retreated hastily to a position on the main drive, and began in a\r\ndeep roar, coupled with an unsteady gait, the following ditty:\r\n\r\n\r\n          I am a Soldier\r\n          A jolly British Soldier;\r\n          You can see that I\u2019m a Soldier by my feet....\r\n\r\nIt had been a favourite on the gramophone in Tuppence\u2019s hospital days.\r\nHe did not doubt but that she would recognize it and draw her own\r\nconclusions. Tommy had not a note of music in his voice, but his lungs\r\nwere excellent. The noise he produced was terrific.\r\n\r\nPresently an unimpeachable butler, accompanied by an equally\r\nunimpeachable footman, issued from the front door. The butler\r\nremonstrated with him. Tommy continued to sing, addressing the butler\r\naffectionately as \u201cdear old whiskers.\u201d The footman took him by one arm,\r\nthe butler by the other. They ran him down the drive, and neatly out\r\nof the gate. The butler threatened him with the police if he intruded\r\nagain. It was beautifully done--soberly and with perfect decorum. Anyone\r\nwould have sworn that the butler was a real butler, the footman a real\r\nfootman--only, as it happened, the butler was Whittington!\r\n\r\nTommy retired to the inn and waited for Albert\u2019s return. At last that\r\nworthy made his appearance.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d cried Tommy eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right. While they was a-running of you out the window opened,\r\nand something was chucked out.\u201d He handed a scrap of paper to Tommy. \u201cIt\r\nwas wrapped round a letterweight.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn the paper were scrawled three words: \u201cTo-morrow--same time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood egg!\u201d cried Tommy. \u201cWe\u2019re getting going.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wrote a message on a piece of paper, wrapped it round a stone, and\r\nchucked it through the window,\u201d continued Albert breathlessly.\r\n\r\nTommy groaned.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour zeal will be the undoing of us, Albert. What did you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSaid we was a-staying at the inn. If she could get away, to come there\r\nand croak like a frog.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll know that\u2019s you,\u201d said Tommy with a sigh of relief. \u201cYour\r\nimagination runs away with you, you know, Albert. Why, you wouldn\u2019t\r\nrecognize a frog croaking if you heard it.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlbert looked rather crest-fallen.\r\n\r\n\u201cCheer up,\u201d said Tommy. \u201cNo harm done. That butler\u2019s an old friend of\r\nmine--I bet he knew who I was, though he didn\u2019t let on. It\u2019s not their\r\ngame to show suspicion. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve found it fairly plain sailing.\r\nThey don\u2019t want to discourage me altogether. On the other hand, they\r\ndon\u2019t want to make it too easy. I\u2019m a pawn in their game, Albert, that\u2019s\r\nwhat I am. You see, if the spider lets the fly walk out too easily,\r\nthe fly might suspect it was a put-up job. Hence the usefulness of that\r\npromising youth, Mr. T. Beresford, who\u2019s blundered in just at the right\r\nmoment for them. But later, Mr. T. Beresford had better look out!\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy retired for the night in a state of some elation. He had\r\nelaborated a careful plan for the following evening. He felt sure that\r\nthe inhabitants of Astley Priors would not interfere with him up to\r\na certain point. It was after that that Tommy proposed to give them a\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nAbout twelve o\u2019clock, however, his calm was rudely shaken. He was told\r\nthat some one was demanding him in the bar. The applicant proved to be a\r\nrude-looking carter well coated with mud.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, my good fellow, what is it?\u201d asked Tommy.\r\n\r\n\u201cMight this be for you, sir?\u201d The carter held out a very dirty folded\r\nnote, on the outside of which was written: \u201cTake this to the gentleman\r\nat the inn near Astley Priors. He will give you ten shillings.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe handwriting was Tuppence\u2019s. Tommy appreciated her quick-wittedness\r\nin realizing that he might be staying at the inn under an assumed name.\r\nHe snatched at it.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man withheld it.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about my ten shillings?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy hastily produced a ten-shilling note, and the man relinquished his\r\nfind. Tommy unfastened it.\r\n\r\n\u201cDEAR TOMMY,\r\n\r\n\u201cI knew it was you last night. Don\u2019t go this evening. They\u2019ll be lying\r\nin wait for you. They\u2019re taking us away this morning. I heard something\r\nabout Wales--Holyhead, I think. I\u2019ll drop this on the road if I get a\r\nchance. Annette told me how you\u2019d escaped. Buck up.\r\n\r\n\u201cYours,\r\n\r\n\u201cTWOPENCE.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy raised a shout for Albert before he had even finished perusing\r\nthis characteristic epistle.\r\n\r\n\u201cPack my bag! We\u2019re off!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d The boots of Albert could be heard racing upstairs.\r\nHolyhead? Did that mean that, after all---- Tommy was puzzled. He read\r\non slowly.\r\n\r\nThe boots of Albert continued to be active on the floor above.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a second shout came from below.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlbert! I\u2019m a damned fool! Unpack that bag!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy smoothed out the note thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, a damned fool,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBut so\u2019s some one else! And at\r\nlast I know who it is!\u201d\r\n\nIN his suite at Claridge\u2019s, Kramenin reclined on a couch and dictated to\r\nhis secretary in sibilant Russian.\r\n\r\nPresently the telephone at the secretary\u2019s elbow purred, and he took up\r\nthe receiver, spoke for a minute or two, then turned to his employer.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome one below is asking for you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe gives the name of Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHersheimmer,\u201d repeated Kramenin thoughtfully. \u201cI have heard that name\r\nbefore.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHis father was one of the steel kings of America,\u201d explained the\r\nsecretary, whose business it was to know everything. \u201cThis young man\r\nmust be a millionaire several times over.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe other\u2019s eyes narrowed appreciatively.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou had better go down and see him, Ivan. Find out what he wants.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe secretary obeyed, closing the door noiselessly behind him. In a few\r\nminutes he returned.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe declines to state his business--says it is entirely private and\r\npersonal, and that he must see you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA millionaire several times over,\u201d murmured Kramenin. \u201cBring him up, my\r\ndear Ivan.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe secretary left the room once more, and returned escorting Julius.\r\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur Kramenin?\u201d said the latter abruptly.\r\n\r\nThe Russian, studying him attentively with his pale venomous eyes,\r\nbowed.\r\n\r\n\u201cPleased to meet you,\u201d said the American. \u201cI\u2019ve got some very important\r\nbusiness I\u2019d like to talk over with you, if I can see you alone.\u201d He\r\nlooked pointedly at the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy secretary, Monsieur Grieber, from whom I have no secrets.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat may be so--but I have,\u201d said Julius dryly. \u201cSo I\u2019d be obliged if\r\nyou\u2019d tell him to scoot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIvan,\u201d said the Russian softly, \u201cperhaps you would not mind retiring\r\ninto the next room----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe next room won\u2019t do,\u201d interrupted Julius. \u201cI know these ducal\r\nsuites--and I want this one plumb empty except for you and me. Send him\r\nround to a store to buy a penn\u2019orth of peanuts.\u201d\r\n\r\nThough not particularly enjoying the American\u2019s free and easy manner\r\nof speech, Kramenin was devoured by curiosity. \u201cWill your business take\r\nlong to state?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMight be an all night job if you caught on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good, Ivan. I shall not require you again this evening. Go to the\r\ntheatre--take a night off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, your excellency.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe secretary bowed and departed.\r\n\r\nJulius stood at the door watching his retreat. Finally, with a satisfied\r\nsigh, he closed it, and came back to his position in the centre of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, Mr. Hersheimmer, perhaps you will be so kind as to come to the\r\npoint?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess that won\u2019t take a minute,\u201d drawled Julius. Then, with an abrupt\r\nchange of manner: \u201cHands up--or I shoot!\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment Kramenin stared blindly into the big automatic, then, with\r\nalmost comical haste, he flung up his hands above his head. In that\r\ninstant Julius had taken his measure. The man he had to deal with was an\r\nabject physical coward--the rest would be easy.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is an outrage,\u201d cried the Russian in a high hysterical voice. \u201cAn\r\noutrage! Do you mean to kill me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot if you keep your voice down. Don\u2019t go edging sideways towards that\r\nbell. That\u2019s better.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you want? Do nothing rashly. Remember my life is of the utmost\r\nvalue to my country. I may have been maligned----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI reckon,\u201d said Julius, \u201cthat the man who let daylight into you would\r\nbe doing humanity a good turn. But you needn\u2019t worry any. I\u2019m not\r\nproposing to kill you this trip--that is, if you\u2019re reasonable.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Russian quailed before the stern menace in the other\u2019s eyes. He\r\npassed his tongue over his dry lips.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you want? Money?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. I want Jane Finn.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJane Finn? I--never heard of her!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a darned liar! You know perfectly who I mean.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI tell you I\u2019ve never heard of the girl.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I tell you,\u201d retorted Julius, \u201cthat Little Willie here is just\r\nhopping mad to go off!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Russian wilted visibly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, yes, I would, son!\u201d\r\n\r\nKramenin must have recognized something in the voice that carried\r\nconviction, for he said sullenly:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell? Granted I do know who you mean--what of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will tell me now--right here--where she is to be found.\u201d\r\n\r\nKramenin shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cI daren\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI daren\u2019t. You ask an impossibility.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAfraid, eh? Of whom? Mr. Brown? Ah, that tickles you up! There is such\r\na person, then? I doubted it. And the mere mention of him scares you\r\nstiff!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have seen him,\u201d said the Russian slowly. \u201cSpoken to him face to face.\r\nI did not know it until afterwards. He was one of a crowd. I should not\r\nknow him again. Who is he really? I do not know. But I know this--he is\r\na man to fear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019ll never know,\u201d said Julius.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe knows everything--and his vengeance is swift. Even\r\nI--Kramenin!--would not be exempt!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you won\u2019t do as I ask you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou ask an impossibility.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure that\u2019s a pity for you,\u201d said Julius cheerfully. \u201cBut the world in\r\ngeneral will benefit.\u201d He raised the revolver.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop,\u201d shrieked the Russian. \u201cYou cannot mean to shoot me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course I do. I\u2019ve always heard you Revolutionists held life cheap,\r\nbut it seems there\u2019s a difference when it\u2019s your own life in question.\r\nI gave you just one chance of saving your dirty skin, and that you\r\nwouldn\u2019t take!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey would kill me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Julius pleasantly, \u201cit\u2019s up to you. But I\u2019ll just say this.\r\nLittle Willie here is a dead cert, and if I was you I\u2019d take a sporting\r\nchance with Mr. Brown!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will hang if you shoot me,\u201d muttered the Russian irresolutely.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, stranger, that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. You forget the dollars. A\r\nbig crowd of solicitors will get busy, and they\u2019ll get some high-brow\r\ndoctors on the job, and the end of it all will be that they\u2019ll say my\r\nbrain was unhinged. I shall spend a few months in a quiet sanatorium, my\r\nmental health will improve, the doctors will declare me sane again, and\r\nall will end happily for little Julius. I guess I can bear a few months\u2019\r\nretirement in order to rid the world of you, but don\u2019t you kid yourself\r\nI\u2019ll hang for it!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Russian believed him. Corrupt himself, he believed implicitly in the\r\npower of money. He had read of American murder trials running much on\r\nthe lines indicated by Julius. He had bought and sold justice himself.\r\nThis virile young American, with the significant drawling voice, had the\r\nwhip hand of him.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to count five,\u201d continued Julius, \u201cand I guess, if you let me\r\nget past four, you needn\u2019t worry any about Mr. Brown. Maybe he\u2019ll send\r\nsome flowers to the funeral, but _you_ won\u2019t smell them! Are you ready?\r\nI\u2019ll begin. One--two--three--four----\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Russian interrupted with a shriek:\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not shoot. I will do all you wish.\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius lowered the revolver.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d hear sense. Where is the girl?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt Gatehouse, in Kent. Astley Priors, the place is called.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs she a prisoner there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not allowed to leave the house--though it\u2019s safe enough really.\r\nThe little fool has lost her memory, curse her!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s been annoying for you and your friends, I reckon. What about the\r\nother girl, the one you decoyed away over a week ago?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s there too,\u201d said the Russian sullenly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d said Julius. \u201cIsn\u2019t it all panning out beautifully? And a\r\nlovely night for the run!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat run?\u201d demanded Kramenin, with a stare.\r\n\r\n\u201cDown to Gatehouse, sure. I hope you\u2019re fond of motoring?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean? I refuse to go.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow don\u2019t get mad. You must see I\u2019m not such a kid as to leave you\r\nhere. You\u2019d ring up your friends on that telephone first thing! Ah!\u201d He\r\nobserved the fall on the other\u2019s face. \u201cYou see, you\u2019d got it all fixed.\r\nNo, sir, you\u2019re coming along with me. This your bedroom next door here?\r\nWalk right in. Little Willie and I will come behind. Put on a thick\r\ncoat, that\u2019s right. Fur lined? And you a Socialist! Now we\u2019re ready. We\r\nwalk downstairs and out through the hall to where my car\u2019s waiting. And\r\ndon\u2019t you forget I\u2019ve got you covered every inch of the way. I can shoot\r\njust as well through my coat pocket. One word, or a glance even, at one\r\nof those liveried menials, and there\u2019ll sure be a strange face in the\r\nSulphur and Brimstone Works!\u201d\r\n\r\nTogether they descended the stairs, and passed out to the waiting car.\r\nThe Russian was shaking with rage. The hotel servants surrounded them.\r\nA cry hovered on his lips, but at the last minute his nerve failed him.\r\nThe American was a man of his word.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the car, Julius breathed a sigh of relief. The\r\ndanger-zone was passed. Fear had successfully hypnotized the man by his\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet in,\u201d he ordered. Then as he caught the other\u2019s sidelong glance,\r\n\u201cNo, the chauffeur won\u2019t help you any. Naval man. Was on a submarine in\r\nRussia when the Revolution broke out. A brother of his was murdered by\r\nyour people. George!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir?\u201d The chauffeur turned his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis gentleman is a Russian Bolshevik. We don\u2019t want to shoot him, but\r\nit may be necessary. You understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerfectly, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to go to Gatehouse in Kent. Know the road at all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, it will be about an hour and a half\u2019s run.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMake it an hour. I\u2019m in a hurry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best, sir.\u201d The car shot forward through the traffic.\r\n\r\nJulius ensconced himself comfortably by the side of his victim. He kept\r\nhis hand in the pocket of his coat, but his manner was urbane to the\r\nlast degree.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was a man I shot once in Arizona----\u201d he began cheerfully.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the hour\u2019s run the unfortunate Kramenin was more dead than\r\nalive. In succession to the anecdote of the Arizona man, there had been\r\na tough from \u2018Frisco, and an episode in the Rockies. Julius\u2019s narrative\r\nstyle, if not strictly accurate, was picturesque!\r\n\r\nSlowing down, the chauffeur called over his shoulder that they were just\r\ncoming into Gatehouse. Julius bade the Russian direct them. His plan was\r\nto drive straight up to the house. There Kramenin was to ask for the two\r\ngirls. Julius explained to him that Little Willie would not be tolerant\r\nof failure. Kramenin, by this time, was as putty in the other\u2019s hands.\r\nThe terrific pace they had come had still further unmanned him. He had\r\ngiven himself up for dead at every corner.\r\n\r\nThe car swept up the drive, and stopped before the porch. The chauffeur\r\nlooked round for orders.\r\n\r\n\u201cTurn the car first, George. Then ring the bell, and get back to your\r\nplace. Keep the engine going, and be ready to scoot like hell when I\r\ngive the word.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe front door was opened by the butler. Kramenin felt the muzzle of the\r\nrevolver pressed against his ribs.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d hissed Julius. \u201cAnd be careful.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Russian beckoned. His lips were white, and his voice was not very\r\nsteady:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is I--Kramenin! Bring down the girl at once! There is no time to\r\nlose!\u201d\r\n\r\nWhittington had come down the steps. He uttered an exclamation of\r\nastonishment at seeing the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou! What\u2019s up? Surely you know the plan----\u201d\r\n\r\nKramenin interrupted him, using the words that have created many\r\nunnecessary panics:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have been betrayed! Plans must be abandoned. We must save our own\r\nskins. The girl! And at once! It\u2019s our only chance.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhittington hesitated, but for hardly a moment.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have orders--from _him?_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNaturally! Should I be here otherwise? Hurry! There is no time to be\r\nlost. The other little fool had better come too.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhittington turned and ran back into the house. The agonizing minutes\r\nwent by. Then--two figures hastily huddled in cloaks appeared on the\r\nsteps and were hustled into the car. The smaller of the two was inclined\r\nto resist and Whittington shoved her in unceremoniously. Julius leaned\r\nforward, and in doing so the light from the open door lit up his face.\r\nAnother man on the steps behind Whittington gave a startled exclamation.\r\nConcealment was at an end.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet a move on, George,\u201d shouted Julius.\r\n\r\nThe chauffeur slipped in his clutch, and with a bound the car started.\r\n\r\nThe man on the steps uttered an oath. His hand went to his pocket. There\r\nwas a flash and a report. The bullet just missed the taller girl by an\r\ninch.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet down, Jane,\u201d cried Julius. \u201cFlat on the bottom of the car.\u201d He\r\nthrust her sharply forward, then standing up, he took careful aim and\r\nfired.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you hit him?\u201d cried Tuppence eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d replied Julius. \u201cHe isn\u2019t killed, though. Skunks like that take\r\na lot of killing. Are you all right, Tuppence?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course I am. Where\u2019s Tommy? And who\u2019s this?\u201d She indicated the\r\nshivering Kramenin.\r\n\r\n\u201cTommy\u2019s making tracks for the Argentine. I guess he thought you\u2019d\r\nturned up your toes. Steady through the gate, George! That\u2019s right.\r\nIt\u2019ll take \u2018em at least five minutes to get busy after us. They\u2019ll use\r\nthe telephone, I guess, so look out for snares ahead--and don\u2019t take the\r\ndirect route. Who\u2019s this, did you say, Tuppence? Let me present Monsieur\r\nKramenin. I persuaded him to come on the trip for his health.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Russian remained mute, still livid with terror.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what made them let us go?\u201d demanded Tuppence suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\u201cI reckon Monsieur Kramenin here asked them so prettily they just\r\ncouldn\u2019t refuse!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was too much for the Russian. He burst out vehemently:\r\n\r\n\u201cCurse you--curse you! They know now that I betrayed them. My life won\u2019t\r\nbe safe for an hour in this country.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d assented Julius. \u201cI\u2019d advise you to make tracks for Russia\r\nright away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me go, then,\u201d cried the other. \u201cI have done what you asked. Why do\r\nyou still keep me with you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot for the pleasure of your company. I guess you can get right off now\r\nif you want to. I thought you\u2019d rather I tooled you back to London.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may never reach London,\u201d snarled the other. \u201cLet me go here and\r\nnow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure thing. Pull up, George. The gentleman\u2019s not making the return\r\ntrip. If I ever come to Russia, Monsieur Kramenin, I shall expect a\r\nrousing welcome, and----\u201d\r\n\r\nBut before Julius had finished his speech, and before the car had\r\nfinally halted, the Russian had swung himself out and disappeared into\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust a mite impatient to leave us,\u201d commented Julius, as the car\r\ngathered way again. \u201cAnd no idea of saying good-bye politely to the\r\nladies. Say, Jane, you can get up on the seat now.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor the first time the girl spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you \u2018persuade\u2019 him?\u201d she asked.\r\n\r\nJulius tapped his revolver.\r\n\r\n\u201cLittle Willie here takes the credit!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSplendid!\u201d cried the girl. The colour surged into her face, her eyes\r\nlooked admiringly at Julius.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnnette and I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to us,\u201d said\r\nTuppence. \u201cOld Whittington hurried us off. _We_ thought it was lambs to\r\nthe slaughter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnnette,\u201d said Julius. \u201cIs that what you call her?\u201d\r\n\r\nHis mind seemed to be trying to adjust itself to a new idea.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s her name,\u201d said Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide.\r\n\r\n\u201cShucks!\u201d retorted Julius. \u201cShe may think it\u2019s her name, because her\r\nmemory\u2019s gone, poor kid. But it\u2019s the one real and original Jane Finn\r\nwe\u2019ve got here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d cried Tuppence.\r\n\r\nBut she was interrupted. With an angry spurt, a bullet embedded itself\r\nin the upholstery of the car just behind her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cDown with you,\u201d cried Julius. \u201cIt\u2019s an ambush. These guys have got busy\r\npretty quickly. Push her a bit, George.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe car fairly leapt forward. Three more shots rang out, but went\r\nhappily wide. Julius, upright, leant over the back of the car.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing to shoot at,\u201d he announced gloomily. \u201cBut I guess there\u2019ll be\r\nanother little picnic soon. Ah!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe raised his hand to his cheek.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are hurt?\u201d said Annette quickly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly a scratch.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl sprang to her feet.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me out! Let me out, I say! Stop the car. It is me they\u2019re after.\r\nI\u2019m the one they want. You shall not lose your lives because of me. Let\r\nme go.\u201d She was fumbling with the fastenings of the door.\r\n\r\nJulius took her by both arms, and looked at her. She had spoken with no\r\ntrace of foreign accent.\r\n\r\n\u201cSit down, kid,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI guess there\u2019s nothing wrong with\r\nyour memory. Been fooling them all the time, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl looked at him, nodded, and then suddenly burst into tears.\r\nJulius patted her on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, there--just you sit tight. We\u2019re not going to let you quit.\u201d\r\n\r\nThrough her sobs the girl said indistinctly:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re from home. I can tell by your voice. It makes me home-sick.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure I\u2019m from home. I\u2019m your cousin--Julius Hersheimmer. I came over to\r\nEurope on purpose to find you--and a pretty dance you\u2019ve led me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe car slackened speed. George spoke over his shoulder:\r\n\r\n\u201cCross-roads here, sir. I\u2019m not sure of the way.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe car slowed down till it hardly moved. As it did so a figure climbed\r\nsuddenly over the back, and plunged head first into the midst of them.\r\n\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Tommy, extricating himself.\r\n\r\nA mass of confused exclamations greeted him. He replied to them\r\nseverally:\r\n\r\n\u201cWas in the bushes by the drive. Hung on behind. Couldn\u2019t let you know\r\nbefore at the pace you were going. It was all I could do to hang on. Now\r\nthen, you girls, get out!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGet out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. There\u2019s a station just up that road. Train due in three minutes.\r\nYou\u2019ll catch it if you hurry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the devil are you driving at?\u201d demanded Julius. \u201cDo you think you\r\ncan fool them by leaving the car?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou and I aren\u2019t going to leave the car. Only the girls.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re crazed, Beresford. Stark staring mad! You can\u2019t let those girls\r\ngo off alone. It\u2019ll be the end of it if you do.\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy turned to Tuppence.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet out at once, Tuppence. Take her with you, and do just as I say.\r\nNo one will do you any harm. You\u2019re safe. Take the train to London. Go\r\nstraight to Sir James Peel Edgerton. Mr. Carter lives out of town, but\r\nyou\u2019ll be safe with him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDarn you!\u201d cried Julius. \u201cYou\u2019re mad. Jane, you stay where you are.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a sudden swift movement, Tommy snatched the revolver from Julius\u2019s\r\nhand, and levelled it at him.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow will you believe I\u2019m in earnest? Get out, both of you, and do as I\r\nsay--or I\u2019ll shoot!\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence sprang out, dragging the unwilling Jane after her.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome on, it\u2019s all right. If Tommy\u2019s sure--he\u2019s sure. Be quick. We\u2019ll\r\nmiss the train.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey started running.\r\n\r\nJulius\u2019s pent-up rage burst forth.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the hell----\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\u201cDry up! I want a few words with you, Mr. Julius Hersheimmer.\u201d\r\n\nHER arm through Jane\u2019s, dragging her along, Tuppence reached the\r\nstation. Her quick ears caught the sound of the approaching train.\r\n\r\n\u201cHurry up,\u201d she panted, \u201cor we\u2019ll miss it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey arrived on the platform just as the train came to a standstill.\r\nTuppence opened the door of an empty first-class compartment, and the\r\ntwo girls sank down breathless on the padded seats.\r\n\r\nA man looked in, then passed on to the next carriage. Jane started\r\nnervously. Her eyes dilated with terror. She looked questioningly at\r\nTuppence.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs he one of them, do you think?\u201d she breathed.\r\n\r\nTuppence shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s all right.\u201d She took Jane\u2019s hand in hers. \u201cTommy wouldn\u2019t\r\nhave told us to do this unless he was sure we\u2019d be all right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t know them as I do!\u201d The girl shivered. \u201cYou can\u2019t\r\nunderstand. Five years! Five long years! Sometimes I thought I should go\r\nmad.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind. It\u2019s all over.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs it?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe train was moving now, speeding through the night at a gradually\r\nincreasing rate. Suddenly Jane Finn started up.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat was that? I thought I saw a face--looking in through the window.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, there\u2019s nothing. See.\u201d Tuppence went to the window, and lifting the\r\nstrap let the pane down.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite sure.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe other seemed to feel some excuse was necessary:\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m acting like a frightened rabbit, but I can\u2019t help it. If\r\nthey caught me now they\u2019d----\u201d Her eyes opened wide and staring.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Don\u2019t!_\u201d implored Tuppence. \u201cLie back, and _don\u2019t think_. You can be\r\nquite sure that Tommy wouldn\u2019t have said it was safe if it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy cousin didn\u2019t think so. He didn\u2019t want us to do this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Tuppence, rather embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you thinking of?\u201d said Jane sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour voice was so--queer!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI _was_ thinking of something,\u201d confessed Tuppence. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want\r\nto tell you--not now. I may be wrong, but I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s just\r\nan idea that came into my head a long time ago. Tommy\u2019s got it too--I\u2019m\r\nalmost sure he has. But don\u2019t _you_ worry--there\u2019ll be time enough for\r\nthat later. And it mayn\u2019t be so at all! Do what I tell you--lie back and\r\ndon\u2019t think of anything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d The long lashes drooped over the hazel eyes.\r\n\r\nTuppence, for her part, sat bolt upright--much in the attitude of a\r\nwatchful terrier on guard. In spite of herself she was nervous. Her eyes\r\nflashed continually from one window to the other. She noted the exact\r\nposition of the communication cord. What it was that she feared, she\r\nwould have been hard put to it to say. But in her own mind she was\r\nfar from feeling the confidence displayed in her words. Not that she\r\ndisbelieved in Tommy, but occasionally she was shaken with doubts as to\r\nwhether anyone so simple and honest as he was could ever be a match for\r\nthe fiendish subtlety of the arch-criminal.\r\n\r\nIf they once reached Sir James Peel Edgerton in safety, all would be\r\nwell. But would they reach him? Would not the silent forces of Mr. Brown\r\nalready be assembling against them? Even that last picture of Tommy,\r\nrevolver in hand, failed to comfort her. By now he might be overpowered,\r\nborne down by sheer force of numbers.... Tuppence mapped out her plan of\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nAs the train at length drew slowly into Charing Cross, Jane Finn sat up\r\nwith a start.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave we arrived? I never thought we should!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I thought we\u2019d get to London all right. If there\u2019s going to be any\r\nfun, now is when it will begin. Quick, get out. We\u2019ll nip into a taxi.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn another minute they were passing the barrier, had paid the necessary\r\nfares, and were stepping into a taxi.\r\n\r\n\u201cKing\u2019s Cross,\u201d directed Tuppence. Then she gave a jump. A man looked in\r\nat the window, just as they started. She was almost certain it was the\r\nsame man who had got into the carriage next to them. She had a horrible\r\nfeeling of being slowly hemmed in on every side.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d she explained to Jane, \u201cif they think we\u2019re going to Sir\r\nJames, this will put them off the scent. Now they\u2019ll imagine we\u2019re going\r\nto Mr. Carter. His country place is north of London somewhere.\u201d\r\n\r\nCrossing Holborn there was a block, and the taxi was held up. This was\r\nwhat Tuppence had been waiting for.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuick,\u201d she whispered. \u201cOpen the right-hand door!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe two girls stepped out into the traffic. Two minutes later they were\r\nseated in another taxi and were retracing their steps, this time direct\r\nto Carlton House Terrace.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d said Tuppence, with great satisfaction, \u201cthis ought to do them.\r\nI can\u2019t help thinking that I\u2019m really rather clever! How that other taxi\r\nman will swear! But I took his number, and I\u2019ll send him a postal order\r\nto-morrow, so that he won\u2019t lose by it if he happens to be genuine.\r\nWhat\u2019s this thing swerving----Oh!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a grinding noise and a bump. Another taxi had collided with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn a flash Tuppence was out on the pavement. A policeman was\r\napproaching. Before he arrived Tuppence had handed the driver five\r\nshillings, and she and Jane had merged themselves in the crowd.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a step or two now,\u201d said Tuppence breathlessly. The accident\r\nhad taken place in Trafalgar Square.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you think the collision was an accident, or done deliberately?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. It might have been either.\u201d\r\n\r\nHand-in-hand, the two girls hurried along.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may be my fancy,\u201d said Tuppence suddenly, \u201cbut I feel as though\r\nthere was some one behind us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHurry!\u201d murmured the other. \u201cOh, hurry!\u201d\r\n\r\nThey were now at the corner of Carlton House Terrace, and their spirits\r\nlightened. Suddenly a large and apparently intoxicated man barred their\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood evening, ladies,\u201d he hiccupped. \u201cWhither away so fast?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us pass, please,\u201d said Tuppence imperiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust a word with your pretty friend here.\u201d He stretched out an unsteady\r\nhand, and clutched Jane by the shoulder. Tuppence heard other footsteps\r\nbehind. She did not pause to ascertain whether they were friends or\r\nfoes. Lowering her head, she repeated a man\u0153uvre of childish days,\r\nand butted their aggressor full in the capacious middle. The success of\r\nthese unsportsmanlike tactics was immediate. The man sat down abruptly\r\non the pavement. Tuppence and Jane took to their heels. The house they\r\nsought was some way down. Other footsteps echoed behind them. Their\r\nbreath was coming in choking gasps as they reached Sir James\u2019s door.\r\nTuppence seized the bell and Jane the knocker.\r\n\r\nThe man who had stopped them reached the foot of the steps. For a moment\r\nhe hesitated, and as he did so the door opened. They fell into the hall\r\ntogether. Sir James came forward from the library door.\r\n\r\n\u201cHullo! What\u2019s this?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stepped forward, and put his arm round Jane as she swayed\r\nuncertainly. He half carried her into the library, and laid her on the\r\nleather couch. From a tantalus on the table he poured out a few drops of\r\nbrandy, and forced her to drink them. With a sigh she sat up, her eyes\r\nstill wild and frightened.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right. Don\u2019t be afraid, my child. You\u2019re quite safe.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer breath came more normally, and the colour was returning to her\r\ncheeks. Sir James looked at Tuppence quizzically.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not dead, Miss Tuppence, any more than that Tommy boy of\r\nyours was!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Young Adventurers take a lot of killing,\u201d boasted Tuppence.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo it seems,\u201d said Sir James dryly. \u201cAm I right in thinking that the\r\njoint venture has ended in success, and that this\u201d--he turned to the\r\ngirl on the couch--\u201cis Miss Jane Finn?\u201d\r\n\r\nJane sat up.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cI am Jane Finn. I have a lot to tell you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you are stronger----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo--now!\u201d Her voice rose a little. \u201cI shall feel safer when I have told\r\neverything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs you please,\u201d said the lawyer.\r\n\r\nHe sat down in one of the big arm-chairs facing the couch. In a low\r\nvoice Jane began her story.\r\n\r\n\u201cI came over on the _Lusitania_ to take up a post in Paris. I was\r\nfearfully keen about the war, and just dying to help somehow or other. I\r\nhad been studying French, and my teacher said they were wanting help in\r\na hospital in Paris, so I wrote and offered my services, and they were\r\naccepted. I hadn\u2019t got any folk of my own, so it made it easy to arrange\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen the _Lusitania_ was torpedoed, a man came up to me. I\u2019d noticed\r\nhim more than once--and I\u2019d figured it out in my own mind that he\r\nwas afraid of somebody or something. He asked me if I was a patriotic\r\nAmerican, and told me he was carrying papers which were just life or\r\ndeath to the Allies. He asked me to take charge of them. I was to watch\r\nfor an advertisement in the _Times_. If it didn\u2019t appear, I was to take\r\nthem to the American Ambassador.\r\n\r\n\u201cMost of what followed seems like a nightmare still. I see it in my\r\ndreams sometimes.... I\u2019ll hurry over that part. Mr. Danvers had told me\r\nto watch out. He might have been shadowed from New York, but he didn\u2019t\r\nthink so. At first I had no suspicions, but on the boat to Holyhead I\r\nbegan to get uneasy. There was one woman who had been very keen to look\r\nafter me, and chum up with me generally--a Mrs. Vandemeyer. At first I\u2019d\r\nbeen only grateful to her for being so kind to me; but all the time I\r\nfelt there was something about her I didn\u2019t like, and on the Irish\r\nboat I saw her talking to some queer-looking men, and from the way they\r\nlooked I saw that they were talking about me. I remembered that she\u2019d\r\nbeen quite near me on the _Lusitania_ when Mr. Danvers gave me the\r\npacket, and before that she\u2019d tried to talk to him once or twice. I\r\nbegan to get scared, but I didn\u2019t quite see what to do.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had a wild idea of stopping at Holyhead, and not going on to London\r\nthat day, but I soon saw that that would be plumb foolishness. The only\r\nthing was to act as though I\u2019d noticed nothing, and hope for the best.\r\nI couldn\u2019t see how they could get me if I was on my guard. One thing\r\nI\u2019d done already as a precaution--ripped open the oilskin packet and\r\nsubstituted blank paper, and then sewn it up again. So, if anyone did\r\nmanage to rob me of it, it wouldn\u2019t matter.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat to do with the real thing worried me no end. Finally I opened it\r\nout flat--there were only two sheets--and laid it between two of the\r\nadvertisement pages of a magazine. I stuck the two pages together\r\nround the edge with some gum off an envelope. I carried the magazine\r\ncarelessly stuffed into the pocket of my ulster.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt Holyhead I tried to get into a carriage with people that looked all\r\nright, but in a queer way there seemed always to be a crowd round me\r\nshoving and pushing me just the way I didn\u2019t want to go. There was\r\nsomething uncanny and frightening about it. In the end I found myself in\r\na carriage with Mrs. Vandemeyer after all. I went out into the corridor,\r\nbut all the other carriages were full, so I had to go back and sit down.\r\nI consoled myself with the thought that there were other people in the\r\ncarriage--there was quite a nice-looking man and his wife sitting just\r\nopposite. So I felt almost happy about it until just outside London. I\r\nhad leaned back and closed my eyes. I guess they thought I was asleep,\r\nbut my eyes weren\u2019t quite shut, and suddenly I saw the nice-looking man\r\nget something out of his bag and hand it to Mrs. Vandemeyer, and as he\r\ndid so he _winked_....\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how that wink sort of froze me through and through. My\r\nonly thought was to get out in the corridor as quick as ever I could. I\r\ngot up, trying to look natural and easy. Perhaps they saw something--I\r\ndon\u2019t know--but suddenly Mrs. Vandemeyer said \u2018Now,\u2019 and flung something\r\nover my nose and mouth as I tried to scream. At the same moment I felt a\r\nterrific blow on the back of my head....\u201d\r\n\r\nShe shuddered. Sir James murmured something sympathetically. In a minute\r\nshe resumed:\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how long it was before I came back to consciousness. I\r\nfelt very ill and sick. I was lying on a dirty bed. There was a\r\nscreen round it, but I could hear two people talking in the room. Mrs.\r\nVandemeyer was one of them. I tried to listen, but at first I couldn\u2019t\r\ntake much in. When at last I did begin to grasp what was going on--I was\r\njust terrified! I wonder I didn\u2019t scream right out there and then.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey hadn\u2019t found the papers. They\u2019d got the oilskin packet with the\r\nblanks, and they were just mad! They didn\u2019t know whether _I_\u2018d changed\r\nthe papers, or whether Danvers had been carrying a dummy message,\r\nwhile the real one was sent another way. They spoke of\u201d--she closed her\r\neyes--\u201ctorturing me to find out!\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d never known what fear--really sickening fear--was before! Once\r\nthey came to look at me. I shut my eyes and pretended to be still\r\nunconscious, but I was afraid they\u2019d hear the beating of my heart.\r\nHowever, they went away again. I began thinking madly. What could I do?\r\nI knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to stand up against torture very long.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuddenly something put the thought of loss of memory into my head. The\r\nsubject had always interested me, and I\u2019d read an awful lot about it.\r\nI had the whole thing at my finger-tips. If only I could succeed in\r\ncarrying the bluff through, it might save me. I said a prayer, and drew\r\na long breath. Then I opened my eyes and started babbling in _French!_\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Vandemeyer came round the screen at once. Her face was so wicked I\r\nnearly died, but I smiled up at her doubtfully, and asked her in French\r\nwhere I was.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt puzzled her, I could see. She called the man she had been talking\r\nto. He stood by the screen with his face in shadow. He spoke to me in\r\nFrench. His voice was very ordinary and quiet, but somehow, I don\u2019t know\r\nwhy, he scared me worse than the woman. I felt he\u2019d seen right through\r\nme, but I went on playing my part. I asked again where I was, and\r\nthen went on that there was something I _must_ remember--_must_\r\nremember--only for the moment it was all gone. I worked myself up to\r\nbe more and more distressed. He asked me my name. I said I didn\u2019t\r\nknow--that I couldn\u2019t remember anything at all.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuddenly he caught my wrist, and began twisting it. The pain was awful.\r\nI screamed. He went on. I screamed and screamed, but I managed to shriek\r\nout things in French. I don\u2019t know how long I could have gone on, but\r\nluckily I fainted. The last thing I heard was his voice saying: \u2018That\u2019s\r\nnot bluff! Anyway, a kid of her age wouldn\u2019t know enough.\u2019 I guess he\r\nforgot American girls are older for their age than English ones, and\r\ntake more interest in scientific subjects.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I came to, Mrs. Vandemeyer was sweet as honey to me. She\u2019d had her\r\norders, I guess. She spoke to me in French--told me I\u2019d had a shock\r\nand been very ill. I should be better soon. I pretended to be rather\r\ndazed--murmured something about the \u2018doctor\u2019 having hurt my wrist. She\r\nlooked relieved when I said that.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy and by she went out of the room altogether. I was suspicious still,\r\nand lay quite quiet for some time. In the end, however, I got up and\r\nwalked round the room, examining it. I thought that even if anyone\r\n_was_ watching me from somewhere, it would seem natural enough under\r\nthe circumstances. It was a squalid, dirty place. There were no windows,\r\nwhich seemed queer. I guessed the door would be locked, but I didn\u2019t\r\ntry it. There were some battered old pictures on the walls, representing\r\nscenes from _Faust_.\u201d\r\n\r\nJane\u2019s two listeners gave a simultaneous \u201cAh!\u201d The girl nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes--it was the place in Soho where Mr. Beresford was imprisoned. Of\r\ncourse, at the time I didn\u2019t even know if I was in London. One thing was\r\nworrying me dreadfully, but my heart gave a great throb of relief when\r\nI saw my ulster lying carelessly over the back of a chair. _And the\r\nmagazine was still rolled up in the pocket!_\r\n\r\n\u201cIf only I could be certain that I was not being overlooked! I looked\r\ncarefully round the walls. There didn\u2019t seem to be a peep-hole of any\r\nkind--nevertheless I felt kind of sure there must be. All of a sudden I\r\nsat down on the edge of the table, and put my face in my hands, sobbing\r\nout a \u2018Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!\u2019 I\u2019ve got very sharp ears. I distinctly heard\r\nthe rustle of a dress, and slight creak. That was enough for me. I was\r\nbeing watched!\r\n\r\n\u201cI lay down on the bed again, and by and by Mrs. Vandemeyer brought me\r\nsome supper. She was still sweet as they make them. I guess she\u2019d been\r\ntold to win my confidence. Presently she produced the oilskin packet,\r\nand asked me if I recognized it, watching me like a lynx all the time.\r\n\r\n\u201cI took it and turned it over in a puzzled sort of way. Then I shook my\r\nhead. I said that I felt I _ought_ to remember something about it, that\r\nit was just as though it was all coming back, and then, before I could\r\nget hold of it, it went again. Then she told me that I was her niece,\r\nand that I was to call her \u2018Aunt Rita.\u2019 I did obediently, and she told\r\nme not to worry--my memory would soon come back.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was an awful night. I\u2019d made my plan whilst I was waiting for her.\r\nThe papers were safe so far, but I couldn\u2019t take the risk of leaving\r\nthem there any longer. They might throw that magazine away any minute.\r\nI lay awake waiting until I judged it must be about two o\u2019clock in the\r\nmorning. Then I got up as softly as I could, and felt in the dark along\r\nthe left-hand wall. Very gently, I unhooked one of the pictures from its\r\nnail--Marguerite with her casket of jewels. I crept over to my coat and\r\ntook out the magazine, and an odd envelope or two that I had shoved in.\r\nThen I went to the washstand, and damped the brown paper at the back\r\nof the picture all round. Presently I was able to pull it away. I had\r\nalready torn out the two stuck-together pages from the magazine, and now\r\nI slipped them with their precious enclosure between the picture and its\r\nbrown paper backing. A little gum from the envelopes helped me to\r\nstick the latter up again. No one would dream the picture had ever been\r\ntampered with. I rehung it on the wall, put the magazine back in my\r\ncoat pocket, and crept back to bed. I was pleased with my hiding-place.\r\nThey\u2019d never think of pulling to pieces one of their own pictures. I\r\nhoped that they\u2019d come to the conclusion that Danvers had been carrying\r\na dummy all along, and that, in the end, they\u2019d let me go.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, I guess that\u2019s what they did think at first, and,\r\nin a way, it was dangerous for me. I learnt afterwards that they nearly\r\ndid away with me then and there--there was never much chance of their\r\n\u2018letting me go\u2019--but the first man, who was the boss, preferred to keep\r\nme alive on the chance of my having hidden them, and being able to tell\r\nwhere if I recovered my memory. They watched me constantly for weeks.\r\nSometimes they\u2019d ask me questions by the hour--I guess there was nothing\r\nthey didn\u2019t know about the third degree!--but somehow I managed to hold\r\nmy own. The strain of it was awful, though....\r\n\r\n\u201cThey took me back to Ireland, and over every step of the journey again,\r\nin case I\u2019d hidden it somewhere _en route_. Mrs. Vandemeyer and another\r\nwoman never left me for a moment. They spoke of me as a young relative\r\nof Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s whose mind was affected by the shock of the\r\n_Lusitania_. There was no one I could appeal to for help without\r\ngiving myself away to _them_, and if I risked it and failed--and Mrs.\r\nVandemeyer looked so rich, and so beautifully dressed, that I felt\r\nconvinced they\u2019d take her word against mine, and think it was part of my\r\nmental trouble to think myself \u2018persecuted\u2019--I felt that the horrors in\r\nstore for me would be too awful once they knew I\u2019d been only shamming.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir James nodded comprehendingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Vandemeyer was a woman of great personality. With that and her\r\nsocial position she would have had little difficulty in imposing her\r\npoint of view in preference to yours. Your sensational accusations\r\nagainst her would not easily have found credence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. It ended in my being sent to a sanatorium at\r\nBournemouth. I couldn\u2019t make up my mind at first whether it was a sham\r\naffair or genuine. A hospital nurse had charge of me. I was a special\r\npatient. She seemed so nice and normal that at last I determined to\r\nconfide in her. A merciful providence just saved me in time from falling\r\ninto the trap. My door happened to be ajar, and I heard her talking to\r\nsome one in the passage. _She was one of them!_ They still fancied it\r\nmight be a bluff on my part, and she was put in charge of me to make\r\nsure! After that, my nerve went completely. I dared trust nobody.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think I almost hypnotized myself. After a while, I almost forgot\r\nthat I was really Jane Finn. I was so bent on playing the part of Janet\r\nVandemeyer that my nerves began to play me tricks. I became really\r\nill--for months I sank into a sort of stupor. I felt sure I should\r\ndie soon, and that nothing really mattered. A sane person shut up in a\r\nlunatic asylum often ends by becoming insane, they say. I guess I was\r\nlike that. Playing my part had become second nature to me. I wasn\u2019t even\r\nunhappy in the end--just apathetic. Nothing seemed to matter. And the\r\nyears went on.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then suddenly things seemed to change. Mrs. Vandemeyer came down\r\nfrom London. She and the doctor asked me questions, experimented with\r\nvarious treatments. There was some talk of sending me to a specialist in\r\nParis. In the end, they did not dare risk it. I overheard something that\r\nseemed to show that other people--friends--were looking for me. I\r\nlearnt later that the nurse who had looked after me went to Paris,\r\nand consulted a specialist, representing herself to be me. He put her\r\nthrough some searching tests, and exposed her loss of memory to be\r\nfraudulent; but she had taken a note of his methods and reproduced\r\nthem on me. I dare say I couldn\u2019t have deceived the specialist for a\r\nminute--a man who has made a lifelong study of a thing is unique--but\r\nI managed once again to hold my own with them. The fact that I\u2019d not\r\nthought of myself as Jane Finn for so long made it easier.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne night I was whisked off to London at a moment\u2019s notice. They took\r\nme back to the house in Soho. Once I got away from the sanatorium I felt\r\ndifferent--as though something in me that had been buried for a long\r\ntime was waking up again.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey sent me in to wait on Mr. Beresford. (Of course I didn\u2019t know\r\nhis name then.) I was suspicious--I thought it was another trap. But he\r\nlooked so honest, I could hardly believe it. However, I was careful in\r\nall I said, for I knew we could be overheard. There\u2019s a small hole, high\r\nup in the wall.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut on the Sunday afternoon a message was brought to the house. They\r\nwere all very disturbed. Without their knowing, I listened. Word had\r\ncome that he was to be killed. I needn\u2019t tell the next part, because\r\nyou know it. I thought I\u2019d have time to rush up and get the papers from\r\ntheir hiding-place, but I was caught. So I screamed out that he was\r\nescaping, and I said I wanted to go back to Marguerite. I shouted the\r\nname three times very loud. I knew the others would think I meant\r\nMrs. Vandemeyer, but I hoped it might make Mr. Beresford think of the\r\npicture. He\u2019d unhooked one the first day--that\u2019s what made me hesitate\r\nto trust him.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe paused.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen the papers,\u201d said Sir James slowly, \u201care still at the back of the\r\npicture in that room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d The girl had sunk back on the sofa exhausted with the strain of\r\nthe long story.\r\n\r\nSir James rose to his feet. He looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d he said, \u201cwe must go at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo-night?\u201d queried Tuppence, surprised.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo-morrow may be too late,\u201d said Sir James gravely. \u201cBesides, by\r\ngoing to-night we have the chance of capturing that great man and\r\nsuper-criminal--Mr. Brown!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was dead silence, and Sir James continued:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have been followed here--not a doubt of it. When we leave the house\r\nwe shall be followed again, but not molested, _for it is Mr. Brown\u2019s\r\nplan that we are to lead him_. But the Soho house is under police\r\nsupervision night and day. There are several men watching it. When we\r\nenter that house, Mr. Brown will not draw back--he will risk all, on the\r\nchance of obtaining the spark to fire his mine. And he fancies the risk\r\nnot great--since he will enter in the guise of a friend!\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence flushed, then opened her mouth impulsively.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut there\u2019s something you don\u2019t know--that we haven\u2019t told you.\u201d Her\r\neyes dwelt on Jane in perplexity.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d asked the other sharply. \u201cNo hesitations, Miss Tuppence.\r\nWe need to be sure of our going.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Tuppence, for once, seemed tongue-tied.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so difficult--you see, if I\u2019m wrong--oh, it would be dreadful.\u201d\r\n She made a grimace at the unconscious Jane. \u201cNever forgive me,\u201d she\r\nobserved cryptically.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou want me to help you out, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, please. _You_ know who Mr. Brown is, don\u2019t you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Sir James gravely. \u201cAt last I do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt last?\u201d queried Tuppence doubtfully. \u201cOh, but I thought----\u201d She\r\npaused.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou thought correctly, Miss Tuppence. I have been morally certain of\r\nhis identity for some time--ever since the night of Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s\r\nmysterious death.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d breathed Tuppence.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor there we are up against the logic of facts. There are only two\r\nsolutions. Either the chloral was administered by her own hand, which\r\ntheory I reject utterly, or else----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOr else it was administered in the brandy you gave her. Only three\r\npeople touched that brandy--you, Miss Tuppence, I myself, and one\r\nother--Mr. Julius Hersheimmer!\u201d\r\n\r\nJane Finn stirred and sat up, regarding the speaker with wide astonished\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt first, the thing seemed utterly impossible. Mr. Hersheimmer, as the\r\nson of a prominent millionaire, was a well-known figure in America. It\r\nseemed utterly impossible that he and Mr. Brown could be one and the\r\nsame. But you cannot escape from the logic of facts. Since the thing\r\nwas so--it must be accepted. Remember Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s sudden and\r\ninexplicable agitation. Another proof, if proof was needed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI took an early opportunity of giving you a hint. From some words of\r\nMr. Hersheimmer\u2019s at Manchester, I gathered that you had understood and\r\nacted on that hint. Then I set to work to prove the impossible possible.\r\nMr. Beresford rang me up and told me, what I had already suspected,\r\nthat the photograph of Miss Jane Finn had never really been out of Mr.\r\nHersheimmer\u2019s possession----\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the girl interrupted. Springing to her feet, she cried out angrily:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean? What are you trying to suggest? That Mr. Brown is\r\n_Julius?_ Julius--my own cousin!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, Miss Finn,\u201d said Sir James unexpectedly. \u201cNot your cousin. The man\r\nwho calls himself Julius Hersheimmer is no relation to you whatsoever.\u201d\r\n\nSIR James\u2019s words came like a bomb-shell. Both girls looked equally\r\npuzzled. The lawyer went across to his desk, and returned with a small\r\nnewspaper cutting, which he handed to Jane. Tuppence read it over\r\nher shoulder. Mr. Carter would have recognized it. It referred to the\r\nmysterious man found dead in New York.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I was saying to Miss Tuppence,\u201d resumed the lawyer, \u201cI set to work\r\nto prove the impossible possible. The great stumbling-block was the\r\nundeniable fact that Julius Hersheimmer was not an assumed name. When I\r\ncame across this paragraph my problem was solved. Julius Hersheimmer set\r\nout to discover what had become of his cousin. He went out West, where\r\nhe obtained news of her and her photograph to aid him in his search. On\r\nthe eve of his departure from New York he was set upon and murdered. His\r\nbody was dressed in shabby clothes, and the face disfigured to prevent\r\nidentification. Mr. Brown took his place. He sailed immediately for\r\nEngland. None of the real Hersheimmer\u2019s friends or intimates saw him\r\nbefore he sailed--though indeed it would hardly have mattered if they\r\nhad, the impersonation was so perfect. Since then he had been hand and\r\nglove with those sworn to hunt him down. Every secret of theirs has been\r\nknown to him. Only once did he come near disaster. Mrs. Vandemeyer knew\r\nhis secret. It was no part of his plan that that huge bribe should ever\r\nbe offered to her. But for Miss Tuppence\u2019s fortunate change of plan, she\r\nwould have been far away from the flat when we arrived there. Exposure\r\nstared him in the face. He took a desperate step, trusting in his\r\nassumed character to avert suspicion. He nearly succeeded--but not\r\nquite.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d murmured Jane. \u201cHe seemed so splendid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe real Julius Hersheimmer _was_ a splendid fellow! And Mr. Brown is\r\na consummate actor. But ask Miss Tuppence if she also has not had her\r\nsuspicions.\u201d\r\n\r\nJane turned mutely to Tuppence. The latter nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to say it, Jane--I knew it would hurt you. And, after\r\nall, I couldn\u2019t be sure. I still don\u2019t understand why, if he\u2019s Mr.\r\nBrown, he rescued us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas it Julius Hersheimmer who helped you to escape?\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence recounted to Sir James the exciting events of the evening,\r\nending up: \u201cBut I can\u2019t see _why!_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you? I can. So can young Beresford, by his actions. As a last\r\nhope Jane Finn was to be allowed to escape--and the escape must be\r\nmanaged so that she harbours no suspicions of its being a put-up job.\r\nThey\u2019re not averse to young Beresford\u2019s being in the neighbourhood, and,\r\nif necessary, communicating with you. They\u2019ll take care to get him out\r\nof the way at the right minute. Then Julius Hersheimmer dashes up and\r\nrescues you in true melodramatic style. Bullets fly--but don\u2019t hit\r\nanybody. What would have happened next? You would have driven straight\r\nto the house in Soho and secured the document which Miss Finn would\r\nprobably have entrusted to her cousin\u2019s keeping. Or, if he conducted the\r\nsearch, he would have pretended to find the hiding-place already rifled.\r\nHe would have had a dozen ways of dealing with the situation, but the\r\nresult would have been the same. And I rather fancy some accident would\r\nhave happened to both of you. You see, you know rather an inconvenient\r\namount. That\u2019s a rough outline. I admit I was caught napping; but\r\nsomebody else wasn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTommy,\u201d said Tuppence softly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. Evidently when the right moment came to get rid of him--he was too\r\nsharp for them. All the same, I\u2019m not too easy in my mind about him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause Julius Hersheimmer is Mr. Brown,\u201d said Sir James dryly. \u201cAnd it\r\ntakes more than one man and a revolver to hold up Mr. Brown....\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence paled a little.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing until we\u2019ve been to the house in Soho. If Beresford has still\r\ngot the upper hand, there\u2019s nothing to fear. If otherwise, our enemy\r\nwill come to find us, and he will not find us unprepared!\u201d From a drawer\r\nin the desk, he took a service revolver, and placed it in his coat\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow we\u2019re ready. I know better than even to suggest going without you,\r\nMiss Tuppence----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should think so indeed!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I do suggest that Miss Finn should remain here. She will be\r\nperfectly safe, and I am afraid she is absolutely worn out with all she\r\nhas been through.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut to Tuppence\u2019s surprise Jane shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. I guess I\u2019m going too. Those papers were my trust. I must go\r\nthrough with this business to the end. I\u2019m heaps better now anyway.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir James\u2019s car was ordered round. During the short drive Tuppence\u2019s\r\nheart beat tumultuously. In spite of momentary qualms of uneasiness\r\nrespecting Tommy, she could not but feel exultation. They were going to\r\nwin!\r\n\r\nThe car drew up at the corner of the square and they got out. Sir James\r\nwent up to a plain-clothes man who was on duty with several others, and\r\nspoke to him. Then he rejoined the girls.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo one has gone into the house so far. It is being watched at the back\r\nas well, so they are quite sure of that. Anyone who attempts to enter\r\nafter we have done so will be arrested immediately. Shall we go in?\u201d\r\n\r\nA policeman produced a key. They all knew Sir James well. They had also\r\nhad orders respecting Tuppence. Only the third member of the party was\r\nunknown to them. The three entered the house, pulling the door to behind\r\nthem. Slowly they mounted the rickety stairs. At the top was the ragged\r\ncurtain hiding the recess where Tommy had hidden that day. Tuppence had\r\nheard the story from Jane in her character of \u201cAnnette.\u201d She looked at\r\nthe tattered velvet with interest. Even now she could almost swear it\r\nmoved--as though _some one_ was behind it. So strong was the illusion\r\nthat she almost fancied she could make out the outline of a form....\r\nSupposing Mr. Brown--Julius--was there waiting....\r\n\r\nImpossible of course! Yet she almost went back to put the curtain aside\r\nand make sure....\r\n\r\nNow they were entering the prison room. No place for anyone to hide\r\nhere, thought Tuppence, with a sigh of relief, then chided herself\r\nindignantly. She must not give way to this foolish fancying--this\r\ncurious insistent feeling that _Mr. Brown was in the house_.... Hark!\r\nwhat was that? A stealthy footstep on the stairs? There _was_ some one\r\nin the house! Absurd! She was becoming hysterical.\r\n\r\nJane had gone straight to the picture of Marguerite. She unhooked it\r\nwith a steady hand. The dust lay thick upon it, and festoons of cobwebs\r\nlay between it and the wall. Sir James handed her a pocket-knife, and\r\nshe ripped away the brown paper from the back.... The advertisement\r\npage of a magazine fell out. Jane picked it up. Holding apart the frayed\r\ninner edges she extracted two thin sheets covered with writing!\r\n\r\nNo dummy this time! The real thing!\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got it,\u201d said Tuppence. \u201cAt last....\u201d\r\n\r\nThe moment was almost breathless in its emotion. Forgotten the faint\r\ncreakings, the imagined noises of a minute ago. None of them had eyes\r\nfor anything but what Jane held in her hand.\r\n\r\nSir James took it, and scrutinized it attentively.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cthis is the ill-fated draft treaty!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve succeeded,\u201d said Tuppence. There was awe and an almost wondering\r\nunbelief in her voice.\r\n\r\nSir James echoed her words as he folded the paper carefully and put it\r\naway in his pocket-book, then he looked curiously round the dingy room.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was here that our young friend was confined for so long, was\r\nit not?\u201d he said. \u201cA truly sinister room. You notice the absence of\r\nwindows, and the thickness of the close-fitting door. Whatever took\r\nplace here would never be heard by the outside world.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence shivered. His words woke a vague alarm in her. What if there\r\n_was_ some one concealed in the house? Some one who might bar that door\r\non them, and leave them to die like rats in a trap? Then she realized\r\nthe absurdity of her thought. The house was surrounded by police who,\r\nif they failed to reappear, would not hesitate to break in and make a\r\nthorough search. She smiled at her own foolishness--then looked up with\r\na start to find Sir James watching her. He gave her an emphatic little\r\nnod.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite right, Miss Tuppence. You scent danger. So do I. So does Miss\r\nFinn.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d admitted Jane. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd--but I can\u2019t help it.\u201d\r\n\r\nSir James nodded again.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou feel--as we all feel-- _the presence of Mr. Bown_. Yes\u201d--as\r\nTuppence made a movement--\u201cnot a doubt of it-- _Mr. Brown is here_....\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn this house?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn this room.... You don\u2019t understand? _I am Mr. Brown_....\u201d\r\n\r\nStupefied, unbelieving, they stared at him. The very lines of his face\r\nhad changed. It was a different man who stood before them. He smiled a\r\nslow cruel smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cNeither of you will leave this room alive! You said just now we had\r\nsucceeded. _I_ have succeeded! The draft treaty is mine.\u201d His smile grew\r\nwider as he looked at Tuppence. \u201cShall I tell you how it will be? Sooner\r\nor later the police will break in, and they will find three victims of\r\nMr. Brown--three, not two, you understand, but fortunately the third\r\nwill not be dead, only wounded, and will be able to describe the attack\r\nwith a wealth of detail! The treaty? It is in the hands of Mr. Brown. So\r\nno one will think of searching the pockets of Sir James Peel Edgerton!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe turned to Jane.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou outwitted me. I make my acknowledgments. But you will not do it\r\nagain.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a faint sound behind him, but, intoxicated with success, he\r\ndid not turn his head.\r\n\r\nHe slipped his hand into his pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cCheckmate to the Young Adventurers,\u201d he said, and slowly raised the big\r\nautomatic.\r\n\r\nBut, even as he did so, he felt himself seized from behind in a grip of\r\niron. The revolver was wrenched from his hand, and the voice of Julius\r\nHersheimmer said drawlingly:\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re caught redhanded with the goods upon you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe blood rushed to the K.C.\u2019s face, but his self-control was\r\nmarvellous, as he looked from one to the other of his two captors. He\r\nlooked longest at Tommy.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou,\u201d he said beneath his breath. \u201c_You!_ I might have known.\u201d\r\n\r\nSeeing that he was disposed to offer no resistance, their grip\r\nslackened. Quick as a flash his left hand, the hand which bore the big\r\nsignet ring, was raised to his lips....\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018_Ave, C\u00e6sar! te morituri salutant_,\u2019\u201d he said, still looking at\r\nTommy.\r\n\r\nThen his face changed, and with a long convulsive shudder he fell\r\nforward in a crumpled heap, whilst an odour of bitter almonds filled the\r\nair.\r\n\nTHE supper party given by Mr. Julius Hersheimmer to a few friends on the\r\nevening of the 30th will long be remembered in catering circles. It took\r\nplace in a private room, and Mr. Hersheimmer\u2019s orders were brief and\r\nforcible. He gave carte blanche--and when a millionaire gives carte\r\nblanche he usually gets it!\r\n\r\nEvery delicacy out of season was duly provided. Waiters carried bottles\r\nof ancient and royal vintage with loving care. The floral decorations\r\ndefied the seasons, and fruits of the earth as far apart as May and\r\nNovember found themselves miraculously side by side. The list of guests\r\nwas small and select. The American Ambassador, Mr. Carter, who had taken\r\nthe liberty, he said, of bringing an old friend, Sir William Beresford,\r\nwith him, Archdeacon Cowley, Dr. Hall, those two youthful adventurers,\r\nMiss Prudence Cowley and Mr. Thomas Beresford, and last, but not least,\r\nas guest of honour, Miss Jane Finn.\r\n\r\nJulius had spared no pains to make Jane\u2019s appearance a success. A\r\nmysterious knock had brought Tuppence to the door of the apartment she\r\nwas sharing with the American girl. It was Julius. In his hand he held a\r\ncheque.\r\n\r\n\u201cSay, Tuppence,\u201d he began, \u201cwill you do me a good turn? Take this, and\r\nget Jane regularly togged up for this evening. You\u2019re all coming to\r\nsupper with me at the _Savoy_. See? Spare no expense. You get me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d mimicked Tuppence. \u201cWe shall enjoy ourselves. It will be a\r\npleasure dressing Jane. She\u2019s the loveliest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d agreed Mr. Hersheimmer fervently.\r\n\r\nHis fervour brought a momentary twinkle to Tuppence\u2019s eye.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the way, Julius,\u201d she remarked demurely, \u201cI--haven\u2019t given you my\r\nanswer yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnswer?\u201d said Julius. His face paled.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know--when you asked me to--marry you,\u201d faltered Tuppence, her\r\neyes downcast in the true manner of the early Victorian heroine, \u201cand\r\nwouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. I\u2019ve thought it well over----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d said Julius. The perspiration stood on his forehead.\r\n\r\nTuppence relented suddenly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou great idiot!\u201d she said. \u201cWhat on earth induced you to do it? I\r\ncould see at the time you didn\u2019t care a twopenny dip for me!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. I had--and still have--the highest sentiments of esteem and\r\nrespect--and admiration for you----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cH\u2019m!\u201d said Tuppence. \u201cThose are the kind of sentiments that very soon\r\ngo to the wall when the other sentiment comes along! Don\u2019t they, old\r\nthing?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d said Julius stiffly, but a large and\r\nburning blush overspread his countenance.\r\n\r\n\u201cShucks!\u201d retorted Tuppence. She laughed, and closed the door, reopening\r\nit to add with dignity: \u201cMorally, I shall always consider I have been\r\njilted!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat was it?\u201d asked Jane as Tuppence rejoined her.\r\n\r\n\u201cJulius.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did he want?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReally, I think, he wanted to see you, but I wasn\u2019t going to let him.\r\nNot until to-night, when you\u2019re going to burst upon every one like King\r\nSolomon in his glory! Come on! _We\u2019re going to shop!_\u201d\r\n\r\nTo most people the 29th, the much-heralded \u201cLabour Day,\u201d had passed much\r\nas any other day. Speeches were made in the Park and Trafalgar Square.\r\nStraggling processions, singing the _Red Flag_, wandered through the\r\nstreets in a more or less aimless manner. Newspapers which had hinted at\r\na general strike, and the inauguration of a reign of terror, were forced\r\nto hide their diminished heads. The bolder and more astute among\r\nthem sought to prove that peace had been effected by following their\r\ncounsels. In the Sunday papers a brief notice of the sudden death of Sir\r\nJames Peel Edgerton, the famous K.C., had appeared. Monday\u2019s paper\r\ndealt appreciatively with the dead man\u2019s career. The exact manner of his\r\nsudden death was never made public.\r\n\r\nTommy had been right in his forecast of the situation. It had been a\r\none-man show. Deprived of their chief, the organization fell to pieces.\r\nKramenin had made a precipitate return to Russia, leaving England early\r\non Sunday morning. The gang had fled from Astley Priors in a panic,\r\nleaving behind, in their haste, various damaging documents which\r\ncompromised them hopelessly. With these proofs of conspiracy in their\r\nhands, aided further by a small brown diary taken from the pocket of the\r\ndead man which had contained a full and damning r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the whole\r\nplot, the Government had called an eleventh-hour conference. The Labour\r\nleaders were forced to recognize that they had been used as a cat\u2019s\r\npaw. Certain concessions were made by the Government, and were eagerly\r\naccepted. It was to be Peace, not War!\r\n\r\nBut the Cabinet knew by how narrow a margin they had escaped utter\r\ndisaster. And burnt in on Mr. Carter\u2019s brain was the strange scene which\r\nhad taken place in the house in Soho the night before.\r\n\r\nHe had entered the squalid room to find that great man, the friend of\r\na lifetime, dead--betrayed out of his own mouth. From the dead man\u2019s\r\npocket-book he had retrieved the ill-omened draft treaty, and then\r\nand there, in the presence of the other three, it had been reduced to\r\nashes.... England was saved!\r\n\r\nAnd now, on the evening of the 30th, in a private room at the _Savoy_,\r\nMr. Julius P. Hersheimmer was receiving his guests.\r\n\r\nMr. Carter was the first to arrive. With him was a choleric-looking old\r\ngentleman, at sight of whom Tommy flushed up to the roots of his hair.\r\nHe came forward.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d said the old gentleman, surveying him apoplectically. \u201cSo you\u2019re\r\nmy nephew, are you? Not much to look at--but you\u2019ve done good work, it\r\nseems. Your mother must have brought you up well after all. Shall we\r\nlet bygones be bygones, eh? You\u2019re my heir, you know; and in future I\r\npropose to make you an allowance--and you can look upon Chalmers Park as\r\nyour home.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, sir, it\u2019s awfully decent of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s this young lady I\u2019ve been hearing such a lot about?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy introduced Tuppence.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d said Sir William, eyeing her. \u201cGirls aren\u2019t what they used to be\r\nin my young days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, they are,\u201d said Tuppence. \u201cTheir clothes are different, perhaps,\r\nbut they themselves are just the same.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, perhaps you\u2019re right. Minxes then--minxes now!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d said Tuppence. \u201cI\u2019m a frightful minx myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe you,\u201d said the old gentleman, chuckling, and pinched her ear\r\nin high good-humour. Most young women were terrified of the \u201cold bear,\u201d\r\n as they termed him. Tuppence\u2019s pertness delighted the old misogynist.\r\n\r\nThen came the timid archdeacon, a little bewildered by the company in\r\nwhich he found himself, glad that his daughter was considered to have\r\ndistinguished herself, but unable to help glancing at her from time\r\nto time with nervous apprehension. But Tuppence behaved admirably. She\r\nforbore to cross her legs, set a guard upon her tongue, and steadfastly\r\nrefused to smoke.\r\n\r\nDr. Hall came next, and he was followed by the American Ambassador.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe might as well sit down,\u201d said Julius, when he had introduced all his\r\nguests to each other. \u201cTuppence, will you----\u201d\r\n\r\nHe indicated the place of honour with a wave of his hand.\r\n\r\nBut Tuppence shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo--that\u2019s Jane\u2019s place! When one thinks of how she\u2019s held out all\r\nthese years, she ought to be made the queen of the feast to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius flung her a grateful glance, and Jane came forward shyly to the\r\nallotted seat. Beautiful as she had seemed before, it was as nothing to\r\nthe loveliness that now went fully adorned. Tuppence had performed her\r\npart faithfully. The model gown supplied by a famous dressmaker had been\r\nentitled \u201cA tiger lily.\u201d It was all golds and reds and browns, and out\r\nof it rose the pure column of the girl\u2019s white throat, and the bronze\r\nmasses of hair that crowned her lovely head. There was admiration in\r\nevery eye, as she took her seat.\r\n\r\nSoon the supper party was in full swing, and with one accord Tommy was\r\ncalled upon for a full and complete explanation.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been too darned close about the whole business,\u201d Julius accused\r\nhim. \u201cYou let on to me that you were off to the Argentine--though I\r\nguess you had your reasons for that. The idea of both you and Tuppence\r\ncasting me for the part of Mr. Brown just tickles me to death!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe idea was not original to them,\u201d said Mr. Carter gravely. \u201cIt was\r\nsuggested, and the poison very carefully instilled, by a past-master in\r\nthe art. The paragraph in the New York paper suggested the plan to him,\r\nand by means of it he wove a web that nearly enmeshed you fatally.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never liked him,\u201d said Julius. \u201cI felt from the first that there was\r\nsomething wrong about him, and I always suspected that it was he who\r\nsilenced Mrs. Vandemeyer so appositely. But it wasn\u2019t till I heard that\r\nthe order for Tommy\u2019s execution came right on the heels of our interview\r\nwith him that Sunday that I began to tumble to the fact that he was the\r\nbig bug himself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI never suspected it at all,\u201d lamented Tuppence. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought\r\nI was so much cleverer than Tommy--but he\u2019s undoubtedly scored over me\r\nhandsomely.\u201d\r\n\r\nJulius agreed.\r\n\r\n\u201cTommy\u2019s been the goods this trip! And, instead of sitting there as dumb\r\nas a fish, let him banish his blushes, and tell us all about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHear! hear!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to tell,\u201d said Tommy, acutely uncomfortable. \u201cI was an\r\nawful mug--right up to the time I found that photograph of Annette, and\r\nrealized that she was Jane Finn. Then I remembered how persistently she\r\nhad shouted out that word \u2018Marguerite\u2019--and I thought of the pictures,\r\nand--well, that\u2019s that. Then of course I went over the whole thing to\r\nsee where I\u2019d made an ass of myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on,\u201d said Mr. Carter, as Tommy showed signs of taking refuge in\r\nsilence once more.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat business about Mrs. Vandemeyer had worried me when Julius told me\r\nabout it. On the face of it, it seemed that he or Sir James must have\r\ndone the trick. But I didn\u2019t know which. Finding that photograph in the\r\ndrawer, after that story of how it had been got from him by Inspector\r\nBrown, made me suspect Julius. Then I remembered that it was Sir James\r\nwho had discovered the false Jane Finn. In the end, I couldn\u2019t make up\r\nmy mind--and just decided to take no chances either way. I left a note\r\nfor Julius, in case he was Mr. Brown, saying I was off to the Argentine,\r\nand I dropped Sir James\u2019s letter with the offer of the job by the desk\r\nso that he would see it was a genuine stunt. Then I wrote my letter to\r\nMr. Carter and rang up Sir James. Taking him into my confidence would\r\nbe the best thing either way, so I told him everything except where I\r\nbelieved the papers to be hidden. The way he helped me to get on the\r\ntrack of Tuppence and Annette almost disarmed me, but not quite. I kept\r\nmy mind open between the two of them. And then I got a bogus note from\r\nTuppence--and I knew!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how?\u201d\r\n\r\nTommy took the note in question from his pocket and passed it round the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s her handwriting all right, but I knew it wasn\u2019t from her because\r\nof the signature. She\u2019d never spell her name \u2018Twopence,\u2019 but anyone\r\nwho\u2019d never seen it written might quite easily do so. Julius _had_ seen\r\nit--he showed me a note of hers to him once--but _Sir James hadn\u2019t!_\r\nAfter that everything was plain sailing. I sent off Albert post-haste to\r\nMr. Carter. I pretended to go away, but doubled back again. When Julius\r\ncame bursting up in his car, I felt it wasn\u2019t part of Mr. Brown\u2019s\r\nplan--and that there would probably be trouble. Unless Sir James was\r\nactually caught in the act, so to speak, I knew Mr. Carter would never\r\nbelieve it of him on my bare word----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d interposed Mr. Carter ruefully.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I sent the girls off to Sir James. I was sure they\u2019d fetch\r\nup at the house in Soho sooner or later. I threatened Julius with the\r\nrevolver, because I wanted Tuppence to repeat that to Sir James, so that\r\nhe wouldn\u2019t worry about us. The moment the girls were out of sight I\r\ntold Julius to drive like hell for London, and as we went along I told\r\nhim the whole story. We got to the Soho house in plenty of time and met\r\nMr. Carter outside. After arranging things with him we went in and hid\r\nbehind the curtain in the recess. The policemen had orders to say, if\r\nthey were asked, that no one had gone into the house. That\u2019s all.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd Tommy came to an abrupt halt.\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d said Julius suddenly, \u201cyou\u2019re all wrong about that\r\nphotograph of Jane. It _was_ taken from me, but I found it again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d cried Tuppence.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn that little safe on the wall in Mrs. Vandemeyer\u2019s bedroom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI knew you found something,\u201d said Tuppence reproachfully. \u201cTo tell you\r\nthe truth, that\u2019s what started me off suspecting you. Why didn\u2019t you\r\nsay?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess I was a mite suspicious too. It had been got away from me once,\r\nand I determined I wouldn\u2019t let on I\u2019d got it until a photographer had\r\nmade a dozen copies of it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe all kept back something or other,\u201d said Tuppence thoughtfully. \u201cI\r\nsuppose secret service work makes you like that!\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the pause that ensued, Mr. Carter took from his pocket a small shabby\r\nbrown book.\r\n\r\n\u201cBeresford has just said that I would not have believed Sir James Peel\r\nEdgerton to be guilty unless, so to speak, he was caught in the act.\r\nThat is so. Indeed, not until I read the entries in this little book\r\ncould I bring myself fully to credit the amazing truth. This book will\r\npass into the possession of Scotland Yard, but it will never be publicly\r\nexhibited. Sir James\u2019s long association with the law would make it\r\nundesirable. But to you, who know the truth, I propose to read certain\r\npassages which will throw some light on the extraordinary mentality of\r\nthis great man.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe opened the book, and turned the thin pages.\r\n\r\n\u201c... It is madness to keep this book. I know that. It is documentary\r\nevidence against me. But I have never shrunk from taking risks. And I\r\nfeel an urgent need for self-expression.... The book will only be taken\r\nfrom my dead body....\r\n\r\n\u201c... From an early age I realized that I had exceptional abilities. Only\r\na fool underestimates his capabilities. My brain power was greatly above\r\nthe average. I know that I was born to succeed. My appearance was\r\nthe only thing against me. I was quiet and insignificant--utterly\r\nnondescript....\r\n\r\n\u201c... When I was a boy I heard a famous murder trial. I was deeply\r\nimpressed by the power and eloquence of the counsel for the defence.\r\nFor the first time I entertained the idea of taking my talents to that\r\nparticular market.... Then I studied the criminal in the dock.... The\r\nman was a fool--he had been incredibly, unbelievably stupid. Even\r\nthe eloquence of his counsel was hardly likely to save him. I felt\r\nan immeasurable contempt for him.... Then it occurred to me that the\r\ncriminal standard was a low one. It was the wastrels, the failures, the\r\ngeneral riff-raff of civilization who drifted into crime....\r\nStrange that men of brains had never realized its extraordinary\r\nopportunities.... I played with the idea.... What a magnificent\r\nfield--what unlimited possibilities! It made my brain reel....\r\n\r\n\u201c... I read standard works on crime and criminals. They all confirmed my\r\nopinion. Degeneracy, disease--never the deliberate embracing of a career\r\nby a far-seeing man. Then I considered. Supposing my utmost ambitions\r\nwere realized--that I was called to the bar, and rose to the height of\r\nmy profession? That I entered politics--say, even, that I became Prime\r\nMinister of England? What then? Was that power? Hampered at every turn\r\nby my colleagues, fettered by the democratic system of which I should\r\nbe the mere figurehead! No--the power I dreamed of was absolute! An\r\nautocrat! A dictator! And such power could only be obtained by working\r\noutside the law. To play on the weaknesses of human nature, then on the\r\nweaknesses of nations--to get together and control a vast organization,\r\nand finally to overthrow the existing order, and rule! The thought\r\nintoxicated me....\r\n\r\n\u201c... I saw that I must lead two lives. A man like myself is bound to\r\nattract notice. I must have a successful career which would mask my true\r\nactivities.... Also I must cultivate a personality. I modelled myself\r\nupon famous K.C.\u2019s. I reproduced their mannerisms, their magnetism. If I\r\nhad chosen to be an actor, I should have been the greatest actor living!\r\nNo disguises--no grease paint--no false beards! Personality! I put it\r\non like a glove! When I shed it, I was myself, quiet, unobtrusive, a man\r\nlike every other man. I called myself Mr. Brown. There are hundreds of\r\nmen called Brown--there are hundreds of men looking just like me....\r\n\r\n\u201c... I succeeded in my false career. I was bound to succeed. I shall\r\nsucceed in the other. A man like me cannot fail....\r\n\r\n\u201c... I have been reading a life of Napoleon. He and I have much in\r\ncommon....\r\n\r\n\u201c... I make a practice of defending criminals. A man should look after\r\nhis own people....\r\n\r\n\u201c... Once or twice I have felt afraid. The first time was in Italy.\r\nThere was a dinner given. Professor D----, the great alienist, was\r\npresent. The talk fell on insanity. He said, \u2018A great many men are\r\nmad, and no one knows it. They do not know it themselves.\u2019 I do not\r\nunderstand why he looked at me when he said that. His glance was\r\nstrange.... I did not like it....\r\n\r\n\u201c... The war has disturbed me.... I thought it would further my plans.\r\nThe Germans are so efficient. Their spy system, too, was excellent.\r\nThe streets are full of these boys in khaki. All empty-headed young\r\nfools.... Yet I do not know.... They won the war.... It disturbs me....\r\n\r\n\u201c... My plans are going well.... A girl butted in--I do not think she\r\nreally knew anything.... But we must give up the Esthonia.... No risks\r\nnow....\r\n\r\n\u201c.... All goes well. The loss of memory is vexing. It cannot be a fake.\r\nNo girl could deceive ME!...\r\n\r\n\u201c...The 29th.... That is very soon....\u201d Mr. Carter paused.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will not read the details of the _coup_ that was planned. But there\r\nare just two small entries that refer to the three of you. In the light\r\nof what happened they are interesting.\r\n\r\n\u201c... By inducing the girl to come to me of her own accord, I have\r\nsucceeded in disarming her. But she has intuitive flashes that might be\r\ndangerous.... She must be got out of the way.... I can do nothing with\r\nthe American. He suspects and dislikes me. But he cannot know. I fancy\r\nmy armour is impregnable.... Sometimes I fear I have underestimated\r\nthe other boy. He is not clever, but it is hard to blind his eyes to\r\nfacts....\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Carter shut the book.\r\n\r\n\u201cA great man,\u201d he said. \u201cGenius, or insanity, who can say?\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was silence.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Carter rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will give you a toast. The Joint Venture which has so amply justified\r\nitself by success!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was drunk with acclamation.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s something more we want to hear,\u201d continued Mr. Carter. He\r\nlooked at the American Ambassador. \u201cI speak for you also, I know. We\u2019ll\r\nask Miss Jane Finn to tell us the story that only Miss Tuppence has\r\nheard so far--but before we do so we\u2019ll drink her health. The health of\r\none of the bravest of America\u2019s daughters, to whom is due the thanks and\r\ngratitude of two great countries!\u201d\r\n\n\u201cTHAT was a mighty good toast, Jane,\u201d said Mr. Hersheimmer, as he and\r\nhis cousin were being driven back in the Rolls-Royce to the _Ritz_.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe one to the joint venture?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo--the one to you. There isn\u2019t another girl in the world who could\r\nhave carried it through as you did. You were just wonderful!\u201d\r\n\r\nJane shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel wonderful. At heart I\u2019m just tired and lonesome--and\r\nlonging for my own country.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat brings me to something I wanted to say. I heard the Ambassador\r\ntelling you his wife hoped you would come to them at the Embassy right\r\naway. That\u2019s good enough, but I\u2019ve got another plan. Jane--I want you to\r\nmarry me! Don\u2019t get scared and say no at once. You can\u2019t love me right\r\naway, of course, that\u2019s impossible. But I\u2019ve loved you from the very\r\nmoment I set eyes on your photo--and now I\u2019ve seen you I\u2019m simply crazy\r\nabout you! If you\u2019ll only marry me, I won\u2019t worry you any--you shall\r\ntake your own time. Maybe you\u2019ll never come to love me, and if that\u2019s\r\nthe case I\u2019ll manage to set you free. But I want the right to look after\r\nyou, and take care of you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I want,\u201d said the girl wistfully. \u201cSome one who\u2019ll be good\r\nto me. Oh, you don\u2019t know how lonesome I feel!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSure thing I do. Then I guess that\u2019s all fixed up, and I\u2019ll see the\r\narchbishop about a special license to-morrow morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Julius!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to hustle you any, Jane, but there\u2019s no sense in\r\nwaiting about. Don\u2019t be scared--I shan\u2019t expect you to love me all at\r\nonce.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut a small hand was slipped into his.\r\n\r\n\u201cI love you now, Julius,\u201d said Jane Finn. \u201cI loved you that first moment\r\nin the car when the bullet grazed your cheek....\u201d\r\n\r\nFive minutes later Jane murmured softly:\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know London very well, Julius, but is it such a very long way\r\nfrom the _Savoy_ to the _Ritz?_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt depends how you go,\u201d explained Julius unblushingly. \u201cWe\u2019re going by\r\nway of Regent\u2019s Park!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Julius--what will the chauffeur think?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the wages I pay him, he knows better than to do any independent\r\nthinking. Why, Jane, the only reason I had the supper at the _Savoy_ was\r\nso that I could drive you home. I didn\u2019t see how I was ever going to\r\nget hold of you alone. You and Tuppence have been sticking together\r\nlike Siamese twins. I guess another day of it would have driven me and\r\nBeresford stark staring mad!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh. Is he----?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course he is. Head over ears.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought so,\u201d said Jane thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom all the things Tuppence didn\u2019t say!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere you have me beat,\u201d said Mr. Hersheimmer. But Jane only laughed.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Young Adventurers were sitting bolt upright,\r\nvery stiff and ill at ease, in a taxi which, with a singular lack of\r\noriginality, was also returning to the _Ritz_ via Regent\u2019s Park.\r\n\r\nA terrible constraint seemed to have settled down between them. Without\r\nquite knowing what had happened, everything seemed changed. They were\r\ntongue-tied--paralysed. All the old _camaraderie_ was gone.\r\n\r\nTuppence could think of nothing to say.\r\n\r\nTommy was equally afflicted.\r\n\r\nThey sat very straight and forbore to look at each other.\r\n\r\nAt last Tuppence made a desperate effort.\r\n\r\n\u201cRather fun, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRather.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother silence.\r\n\r\n\u201cI like Julius,\u201d essayed Tuppence again.\r\n\r\nTommy was suddenly galvanized into life.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to marry him, do you hear?\u201d he said dictatorially. \u201cI\r\nforbid it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Tuppence meekly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAbsolutely, you understand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to marry me--he really only asked me out of kindness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not very likely,\u201d scoffed Tommy.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite true. He\u2019s head over ears in love with Jane. I expect he\u2019s\r\nproposing to her now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll do for him very nicely,\u201d said Tommy condescendingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think she\u2019s the most lovely creature you\u2019ve ever seen?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I dare say.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I suppose you prefer sterling worth,\u201d said Tuppence demurely.\r\n\r\n\u201cI--oh, dash it all, Tuppence, you know!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI like your uncle, Tommy,\u201d said Tuppence, hastily creating a diversion.\r\n\u201cBy the way, what are you going to do, accept Mr. Carter\u2019s offer of\r\na Government job, or accept Julius\u2019s invitation and take a richly\r\nremunerated post in America on his ranch?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall stick to the old ship, I think, though it\u2019s awfully good of\r\nHersheimmer. But I feel you\u2019d be more at home in London.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see where I come in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do,\u201d said Tommy positively.\r\n\r\nTuppence stole a glance at him sideways.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s the money, too,\u201d she observed thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat money?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get a cheque each. Mr. Carter told me so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you ask how much?\u201d inquired Tommy sarcastically.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Tuppence triumphantly. \u201cBut I shan\u2019t tell you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTuppence, you are the limit!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt has been fun, hasn\u2019t it, Tommy? I do hope we shall have lots more\r\nadventures.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re insatiable, Tuppence. I\u2019ve had quite enough adventures for the\r\npresent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, shopping is almost as good,\u201d said Tuppence dreamily. \u201cThink of\r\nbuying old furniture, and bright carpets, and futurist silk curtains,\r\nand a polished dining-table, and a divan with lots of cushions.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHold hard,\u201d said Tommy. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPossibly a house--but I think a flat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhose flat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think I mind saying it, but I don\u2019t in the least! _Ours_, so\r\nthere!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou darling!\u201d cried Tommy, his arms tightly round her. \u201cI was\r\ndetermined to make you say it. I owe you something for the relentless\r\nway you\u2019ve squashed me whenever I\u2019ve tried to be sentimental.\u201d\r\n\r\nTuppence raised her face to his. The taxi proceeded on its course round\r\nthe north side of Regent\u2019s Park.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t really proposed now,\u201d pointed out Tuppence. \u201cNot what our\r\ngrandmothers would call a proposal. But after listening to a rotten one\r\nlike Julius\u2019s, I\u2019m inclined to let you off.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to get out of marrying me, so don\u2019t you think it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat fun it will be,\u201d responded Tuppence. \u201cMarriage is called all sorts\r\nof things, a haven, and a refuge, and a crowning glory, and a state of\r\nbondage, and lots more. But do you know what I think it is?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA sport!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd a damned good sport too,\u201d said Tommy.\r\n\n"}
