mr barrymore be of interest to me she be a heavy solid person very limit intensely <respectable|estimable> and incline to be <puritanical|straight-laced> you could hardly <conceive|believe> a le emotional subject <yet|still> i have tell you how on the first night here i hear her sob bitterly and since then i have more than once observe trace of tear upon her face some deep sorrow gnaw ever at her <heart|nerve> sometimes i wonder if she have a guilty memory which haunt her and sometimes i suspect barrymore of be a domestic <tyrant|autocrat> i have always felt that there be something singular and questionable in this man's character but the adventure of last night bring all my suspicion to a head and yet it may seem a small matter in itself you be aware that i be not a <very|really> sound <sleeper|tie> and since i <have|give> be on <guard|hold> in this house my slumber have be lighter than ever last night <about|near> two in the morning i <be|follow> arouse by a <stealthy|furtive> step pas my room i <rise|jump> open my <door|threshold> and peep out a long black shadow be trail down the corridor it be throw by a <man|piece> who walk <softly|gently> down the passage with a candle <hold|grip> in his hand he be in shirt and <trouser|pant> with no <cover|report> to his foot i could merely see the outline but his height tell me that it be barrymore he walk very slowly and circumspectly and there be something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance i <have|let> tell you that the corridor be break by the balcony which run round the hall but that it be resume upon the farther side i wait until he have pas out of sight and then i follow him when i come round the balcony he have reach the end of the farther corridor and i could see from the glimmer of <light|illumination> through an open door that he have enter one of the <room|way> now all these room be unfurnished and unoccupied so that his expedition <become|go> more mysterious than ever the light <shine|glow> steadily a if he be stand motionless i creep down the passage a noiselessly a i could and peep round the corner of the door barrymore be crouch at the window with the candle hold against the glass his profile be half turn towards me and his face seem to be rigid with expectation a he star out into the <blackness|lightlessness> of the <moor|wharf> for some minute he stand watch intently then he give a deep <groan|moan> and with an impatient gesture he put out the light instantly i make my way back to my room and very shortly come the <stealthy|furtive> <step|footstep> pas once more upon their return journey long afterwards when i have fall into a light sleep i hear a <key|central> turn somewhere in a lock but i could not tell whence the sound come what it all mean i cannot guess but there be some secret business go on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the <bottom|butt> of i do not trouble you with my theory for you ask me to furnish you <only|alone> with fact i have have a long <talk|mouth> with sir henry this morning and we have make a plan of <campaign|cause> found upon my observation of last night i <will|leave> not speak about it just now but it should make my next report interest read baskerville hall oct 15th my dear holmes if i be compel to leave you without much news during the early <day|daytime> of my mission you must acknowledge that i be make up for lose time and that <event|consequence> <be|follow> now crowd thick and fast upon u in my last report i end upon my <top|clear> note with barrymore at the window and now i have quite a budget already which will unless i be much mistake considerably surprise you thing have <take|acquire> a turn which i could not <have|take> anticipate in some way they have <within|inside> the last forty eight hour become much clearer and in some <way|direction> they have become more complicate but i <will|leave> tell you all and you shall judge for yourself before breakfast on the morning follow my adventure i go down the corridor and examine the room in which barrymore have be on the night before the western window through which he have star <so|thus> intently have i notice one peculiarity above all other window in the house it command the <nearest|nigh> <outlook|mentality> on to the moor there be an open between two <tree|corner> which enable one from this point of view to <look|expect> right down upon it while from all the other window it be only a distant glimpse which can be obtain it follow therefore that barrymore since only this window would serve the purpose must have <be|follow> look out for something or somebody upon the moor the <night|dark> <be|follow> very dark so that i can hardly imagine how he could have hop to see anyone it have strike me that it <be|follow> possible that some love intrigue be on foot that would have account for his stealthy movement and also for the uneasiness of his wife the man <be|follow> a <strike|attain> look fellow very <well|intimately> equip to steal the heart of a country girl so that this theory <seem|appear> to <have|get> something to support it that open of the door which i have hear after i have return to my <room|way> might mean that he have go out to keep some clandestine appointment so i reason with myself in the morning and i tell you the direction of my suspicion however much the result may have <show|appearance> that they be unfounded but whatever the true explanation of barrymore's movement might be <i|single> felt that the responsibility of keep them to myself until i could explain them be more than i could bear i have an interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast and i tell him all that i <have|let> see he be le surprise than i have expect i know that barrymore walk about night and i have a mind to speak to him about it say he two or three time i have hear his step in the passage come and go just about the hour you name perhaps then he pay a visit every night to that particular window i suggest perhaps he do if so we should be able to shadow him and see what it be that he be after i wonder what your friend holmes would do if he be here i believe that he would do <exactly|precisely> what you now suggest say i he would follow barrymore and see what he <do|make> then we shall do it together but surely he would hear u the man be rather deaf and in any case we must take our chance of that we'll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he pas sir henry rub his hand with <pleasure|joy> and it be evident that he <hail|come> the <adventure|chance> a a relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor the baronet have be in communication with the architect who <prepare|organize> the plan for sir charles and with a contractor from london so that we may expect great change to begin here soon there have be decorator and furnishers up from plymouth and it be evident that our friend have large idea and mean to spare no pain or expense to restore the grandeur of his family when the house be renovate and refurnish all that he will need will be a wife to make it complete between ourselves there be <pretty|somewhat> clear sign that this will not be want if the lady be will for i have seldom see a man more infatuate with a woman than he <be|follow> with our beautiful neighbour miss stapleton and yet the course of true love do not run quite a smoothly a one would under the circumstance expect today for example it surface be break by a very unexpected ripple which have cause our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance after the conversation which i have quote <about|around> barrymore sir henry put on his hat and prepare to go out a a matter of course i do the same what be you come watson he ask look at me in a curious <way|path> that depend <on|along> whether you be go on the moor say i yes i be well you know what my instruction be i be <sorry|bad> to intrude but you hear how earnestly holmes insist that i should not leave you and especially that you should not go alone upon the <moor|moorland> sir henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile my dear fellow say he holmes with all his wisdom do not foresee some <thing|affair> which have happen since i have be on the moor you understand me i be sure that you be the last man in the world who would wish to be a <spoil|foil> sport i must go out <alone|entirely> it put me in a most awkward position i <be|follow> at a <loss|departure> what to say or what to do and before i have make up my mind he pick up his cane and be go but when i come to <think|consider> the matter over my conscience reproach me bitterly for <have|give> on any pretext allow him to go out of my sight i imagine what my feel would be if i have to return to you and to confess that some misfortune have <occur|come> through my disregard for your instruction i assure you my cheek flush at the <very|really> <think|believe> it might not even now be too late to overtake him so i set off at once in the <direction|management> of merripit house i hurry along the road at the top of my speed without see anything of sir henry until i come to the point where the moor path branch off there fear that perhaps i have come in the wrong direction after all i mount a hill from which i could command a <view|watch> the same hill which be cut into the dark quarry thence i saw him at once he be on the moor path about a quarter of a mile <off|forth> and a lady be by his side who could only be miss stapleton it be clear that there be already an understand between them and that they <have|give> meet by appointment they be walk slowly along in deep conversation and i saw her make quick little movement of her hand a if she be very earnest in what she be say while he listen intently and once or <twice|double> shake his head in strong dissent i stand among the rock <watch|follow> them very much puzzle a to what i should do next to <follow|come> them and <break|give> into their intimate conversation <seem|appear> to be an <outrage|violate> and yet my clear duty be never for an instant to let him out of my <sight|lot> to act the <spy|stag> upon a friend be a hateful task still i could see no better course than to <observe|find> him from the hill and to clear my conscience by confess to him afterwards what i <have|get> do it be true that if any sudden danger have threaten him i <be|follow> too far away to be of use and <yet|however> i be sure that you will agree with me that the position be very difficult and that there be nothing more which i could do our friend sir henry and the lady have halt on the path and be stand deeply absorb in their conversation when i be suddenly aware that i be not the only witness of their interview a wisp of green float in the air catch my eye and another glance show me that it be carry on a stick by a man who be move among the break grind it be stapleton with his butterfly net he be very much closer to the pair than i be and he appear to be move in their <direction|guidance> at this instant sir henry suddenly draw miss stapleton to his side his arm be round her but it <seem|appear> to me that she be strain away from him with her face avert he stoop his head to hers and she raise one hand a if in protest next moment i saw them spring apart and turn hurriedly round stapleton be the cause of the interruption he be run wildly towards them his absurd net dangle behind him he gesticulate and almost dance with excitement in front of the lover what the scene mean i could not imagine but it seem to me that stapleton be abuse sir henry who offer explanation which become more angry a the other refuse to <accept|take> them the lady stand by in haughty silence finally stapleton turn upon his heel and beckon in a peremptory way to his sister who after an irresolute <glance|glimpse> at sir henry walk off by the side of her brother the naturalist's angry gesture show that the lady be include in his displeasure the baronet stand for a minute look after them and then he walk slowly back the way that he have come his head hang the very <picture|photograph> of dejection what all this mean i could not imagine but i be deeply ashamed to have witness so intimate a scene without my friend's knowledge i run down the hill <therefore|so> and meet the baronet at the bottom his face be flush with anger and his brow be wrinkle like one who be at his wit's end what to do halloa watson where have you drop from say he you don't mean to say that you come after me in spite of all i explain everything to him how i have find it impossible to remain behind how i have follow him and how i have <witness|find> all that have <occur|happen> for an instant his eye blaze at me but my frankness disarm his anger and he <break|go> at last into a rather rueful laugh you would <have|give> think the middle of that prairie a fairly safe place for a man to be private say he but by thunder the whole countryside seem to have be out to see me do my woo and a mighty <poor|miserable> woo at that where have you engage a seat i be on that hill quite in the back row eh but her brother be well up to the front do you see him <come|get> out on u yes i do <do|make> he ever strike you a be crazy this brother of hers i can't say that he ever do i dare say not <i|single> always think him sane enough until today but you can take it from me that either he or i ought to be in a straitjacket what's the matter with me anyhow you've live near me for some week watson <tell|say> me straight now be there anything that would prevent me from make a good husband to a woman that i love i should say not he can't object to my worldly <position|view> so it must be myself that he have this down on what have he against me i never hurt <man|humanity> or woman in my life that i <know|recognize> of and yet he would not so much a let me touch the tip of her finger do he say so that and a deal more i <tell|say> you watson i've <only|alone> know her these few week but from the first i just felt that she be make for me and she too she be happy when she be with me and that i'll swear there's a <light|alight> in a woman's <eye|heart> that speak <louder|meretricious> than word but he have never let u get together and it be only today for the first time that i saw a chance of have a few word with her alone she be glad to meet me but when she do it be not love that she would talk about and she wouldn't have let me talk about it either if she could have stop it she keep come back to it that this <be|follow> a <place|locate> of danger and that she would never be happy until i have leave it <i|single> tell her that since i <have|let> see her i be in no <hurry|speed> to leave it and that if she really want me to go the only <way|direction> to work it be for her to arrange to go with me with that i offer in a many word to marry her but before she could answer down come this brother of hers run at u with a face on him like a madman he be <just|exactly> white with rage and those <light|weak> <eye|centre> of his be blaze with fury what be i do with the lady how dare i offer her attention which be distasteful to her do i <think|believe> that because i be a baronet i could do what i like if he have not be her brother i should have know <better|good> how to answer him a it be i tell him that my feel towards his sister be such a i be not ashamed of and that i hop that she might honour me by become my wife that <seem|appear> to make the matter no better so then i lose my <temper|season> too and i answer him rather more hotly than i should perhaps consider that she be stand by so it end by his <go|operate> off with her a you saw and here be i a badly <puzzle|get> a man a any in this county just tell me what it all mean watson and i'll owe you more than ever i can hope to pay i try one or two <explanation|account> but indeed i be completely puzzle myself our friend's title his fortune his age his character and his appearance <be|follow> all in his favour and i know nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which <run|go> in his <family|kin> that his advance should be reject <so|indeed> brusquely without any reference to the lady's own wish and that the lady should accept the situation without protest <be|follow> very <amaze|astonish> however our conjecture be set at rest by a visit from stapleton himself that very afternoon he <have|get> come to offer apology for his rudeness of the morning and after a long private <interview|audience> with sir henry in his study the upshot of their conversation be that the breach be quite heal and that we be to dine at merripit house next friday a a <sign|contract> of it i don't say now that he isn't a crazy man say sir henry i can't forget the <look|count> in his eye when he run at me this morning but i must allow that no man could make a more <handsome|big> <apology|excuse> than he have do do he give any explanation of his conduct his <sister|babe> be everything in his life he say that be natural enough and i be glad that he should <understand|realize> her <value|esteem> they have always be together and accord to his account he have be a very lonely man with only her a a companion so that the think of lose her be really terrible to him he have not understand he say that <i|single> be become attach to her but when he saw with his own eye that it be <really|truly> so and that she might be take away from him it <give|have> him such a <shock|blow> that for a time he be not responsible for what he say or do he be very sorry for all that have pas and he <recognize|realize> how foolish and how selfish it be that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful woman like his <sister|baby> to himself for her <whole|solid> life if she have to leave him he have rather it be to a neighbour like myself than to anyone else but in any case it be a blow to him and it would <take|remove> him some <time|sentence> before he could <prepare|organize> himself to meet it he would withdraw all opposition upon his part if i would promise for three month to let the matter <rest|relief> and to be content with cultivate the lady's friendship during that time without claim her love this i promise and so the matter <rest|stay> so there be one of our small mystery clear up it be something to have touch bottom anywhere in this bog in which we be flounder we know now why stapleton look with disfavour upon his sister's suitor even when that suitor be so eligible a one a sir henry and now i pas on to another thread which i have extricate out of the tangle skein the mystery of the sob in the night of the tear stain face of mr i'm not so light to lift a i use to be gregson and lestrade exchange glance a if they think this proposition rather a bold one but holmes at <once|formerly> take the prisoner at his word and loosen the towel which we have bind round his ancles he rise and stretch his leg a though to assure himself that they be free once more i remember that i think to myself a i eye him that i have seldom see a more powerfully <build|make> man and his dark sunburn <face|expression> bore an expression of determination and energy which be a formidable a his personal strength if there's a vacant place for a chief of the police i reckon you be the man for it he say gaze with undisguised admiration at my fellow lodger the way you keep on my trail be a caution you have <better|respectable> come with me say holmes to the two <detective|investigator> i can drive you say lestrade <good|estimable> and gregson can come inside with me you too doctor you have <take|get> an interest in the case and may a well stick to u <i|single> assent gladly and we all descend together our prisoner make no attempt at escape but <step|measure> calmly into the cab which have be his and we follow him lestrade mount the box whip up the <horse|knight> and bring u in a very short time to our destination we be usher into a small chamber where a police inspector note down our prisoner's name and the name of the men with whose murder he have be charge the official be a white face unemotional man who go through his duty in a dull mechanical way the prisoner will be put before the magistrate in the course of the week he say in the mean time mr jefferson hope <have|let> you anything that you wish to say i must warn you that your word will be take down and may be <use|exercise> against you i've get a good deal to say our prisoner say slowly i want to tell you gentleman all about it hadn't you <better|estimable> reserve that for your trial ask the inspector i may never be try he <answer|do> you needn't look startle it isn't suicide <i|single> be think of be you a doctor he turn his fierce dark eye upon me a he ask this last question yes i be i answer then put your hand here he say with a smile motion with his <manacle|handcuff> wrist towards his chest i do <so|thus> and become at <once|formerly> conscious of an extraordinary throb and commotion which be go on inside the wall of his chest seem to thrill and quiver a a frail build would do inside when some powerful engine be at work in the <silence|secrecy> of the <room|board> i could hear a dull hum and <buzz|hum> <noise|resound> which <proceed|keep> from the same source why i <cry|outcry> you have an aortic aneurism that's what they call it he say placidly i <go|get> to a doctor last week about it and he tell me that it be bind to burst before many day pas it have be get worse for <year|twelvemonth> i get it from over exposure and under <feed|tip> among the salt lake mountain i've do my work now and i don't care how soon <i|single> <go|fling> but i should like to <leave|will> some account of the business behind me i don't want to be remember a a common cut throat the inspector and the two detective have a hurry discussion a to the advisability of allow him to tell his story do you consider <doctor|physician> that there be immediate danger the former ask most <certainly|surely> there be i <answer|respond> in that <case|example> it be clearly our duty in the interest of justice to take his statement say the inspector you be at liberty sir to give your <account|score> which i again warn you will be take down i'll sit down with your leave the prisoner say suit the action to the word this aneurism of mine make me easily tire and the tussle we have half an hour ago have not mend matter i'm on the brink of the grave and i be not likely to lie to you every word i say be the absolute truth and how you <use|apply> it be a matter of no consequence to me with these <word|news> jefferson hope lean back in his chair and begin the follow remarkable statement he speak in a calm and methodical manner a though the event which he narrate be commonplace enough i can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoin account for i have have <access|admission> to lestrade's note book in which the prisoner's word be <take|assume> down exactly a they be <utter|complete> it don't much matter to you why i hat these men he say it's enough that they be guilty of the <death|decease> of two human be a father and a daughter and that they <have|get> therefore forfeit their own live after the lapse of time that have pas since their crime it be impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any <court|romance> i know of their guilt though and i determine that i should be judge jury and executioner all roll into one you'd have do the same if you have any manhood in you if you have <be|follow> in my place that girl that i speak of be to have marry me twenty year ago she be force into marry that same drebber and <break|go> her heart over it i take the marriage ring from her dead <finger|feel> and i vow that his <die|break> eye should rest upon that very <ring|pack> and that his last thought should be of the <crime|offense> for which he be punish i have carry it about with me and have <follow|succeed> him and his accomplice over two continent until i catch them they think to tire me out but they could not do it if i die to morrow a be likely enough i die know that my work in this <world|man> be <do|come> and well do they have perish and by my hand there be <nothing|naught> leave for me to hope for or to desire they be rich and i be poor so that it be no easy matter for me to follow them when i get to london my pocket be about empty and i find that i must turn my <hand|script> to something for my live drive and rid <be|follow> a natural to me a walk so i apply at a cabowner's office and <soon|presently> <get|let> employment i be to <bring|take> a certain sum a week to the owner and whatever be over that i might keep for myself there be seldom much over but <i|single> <manage|handle> to scrape <along|on> somehow the hardest job be to <learn|acquire> my way about for i <reckon|consider> that of all the maze that ever be contrive this city be the most confuse i have a <map|function> beside me though and when once i <have|take> spot the principal hotel and station i get <on|along> pretty well it be some time before <i|single> find out where my two gentleman be <live|alive> but i inquire and inquire until at <last|lowest> i drop across them they be at a board house at camberwell over on the other side of the river when once i find them out i know that i have them at my mercy i have grow my beard and there be no chance of their recognize me i would dog them and follow them until i saw my opportunity i be determine that they should not escape me again they be very <near|nearly> do it for all that go where they would about london i be always at their heel sometimes <i|single> <follow|succeed> them on my cab and sometimes on foot but the former be the best for then they could not get away from me it be only early in the morning or late at night that i could earn anything so that i begin to get behind hand with my employer i do not mind that however a long a i could <lay|repose> my hand upon the men i want they be <very|really> cunning though they must have think that there be some chance of their be <follow|be> for they would never go out alone and never after nightfall during two week i drive behind them every <day|daytime> and never once saw them separate drebber himself <be|follow> drink half the time but stangerson be not to be catch nap i watch them late and early but never saw the ghost of a chance but i be not discourage for something tell me that the <hour|minute> have almost come my only fear be that this thing in my chest might burst a little <too|likewise> soon and leave my work undo at last one even i be drive up and down torquay terrace a the street be call in which they board when i saw a cab drive up to their door presently some luggage be <bring|add> out and after a time drebber and stangerson <follow|succeed> it and drive off i whip up my horse and keep within sight of them feel very ill at <ease|allay> for <i|single> fear that they be go to shift their quarter at euston <station|place> they get out and i <leave|give> a boy to hold my horse and follow them on to the platform i hear them <ask|take> for the liverpool train and the guard answer that one have <just|merely> go and there would not be another for some hour stangerson seem to <be|follow> put out at that but drebber be rather please than otherwise i get so close to them in the bustle that i could hear every word that <pas|pop> between them drebber say that he have a little business of his own to do and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him his companion remonstrate with him and remind him that they have resolve to stick together drebber answer that the matter be a delicate one and that he must go alone i could not catch what stangerson say to that but the other <burst|volley> out swear and remind him that he <be|follow> <nothing|cipher> more than his pay servant and that he must not presume to dictate to him <on|along> that the secretary give it up a a bad job and simply bargain with him that if he <miss|lose> the last <train|check> he should rejoin him at halliday's private hotel to which drebber answer that he would be back <on|along> the platform before eleven and <make|give> his way out of the station the moment for which i have wait so long have at last come i have my <enemy|opposition> within my power together they could protect each other but singly they be at my mercy i do not <act|do> however with <undue|unjustified> precipitation my plan be already form there <be|follow> no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender have time to realize who it be that strike him and why <retribution|vengeance> have come upon him i have my plan arrange by which i should have the opportunity of <make|get> the man who have wrong me understand that his old sin have find him out it chance that some day before a gentleman who have be engage in look over some house in the brixton road have <drop|fell> the key of one of them in my carriage it be claim that same even and return but in the interval i have take a <mould|shape> of it and have a duplicate construct by mean of this i have access to at least one spot in this great city where i could rely upon be free from interruption how to get drebber to that house be the difficult problem which i <have|get> <now|directly> to solve he walk down the road and go into one or two liquor <shop|rat> stay for nearly half an hour in the last of them when he come out he stagger in his walk and be evidently pretty well on there be a hansom just in front of me and he hail it i follow it so close that the nose of my horse be within a yard of his driver the whole way we rattle across waterloo bridge and through mile of street until to my astonishment we find ourselves back in the terrace in which he have board i could not imagine what his intention be in <return|fall> there but i go on and pull up my <cab|hack> a hundred <yard|pace> or so from the house he enter it and his hansom drive away give me a glass of water if you please my <mouth|lip> <get|make> dry with the talk <i|single> hand him the glass and he drink it down that's better he say well i <wait|expect> for a quarter of an hour or more when suddenly there come a noise like <people|mass> struggle inside the house next moment the door be fling open and two men appear one of whom be drebber and the other be a young chap whom i <have|give> never see before this fellow have drebber by the collar and when they <come|follow> to the <head|chief> of the step he give him a shove and a kick which send him half across the road 'you hound he cry shake his stick at him i ll teach you to insult an honest girl he be so hot that i think he would have thrash drebber with his cudgel only that the cur stagger away down the road a fast a his leg would carry him he run a far a the corner and then see my cab he <hail|come> me and jump in 'drive me to halliday's private hotel say he when i have him fairly inside my cab my heart jump so with joy that <i|single> fear lest at this last <moment|bit> my aneurism might go wrong <i|single> drive along slowly weigh in my own mind what it be <best|well> to do i might take him <right|justly> out into the country and there in some desert lane have my last interview with him i have almost <decide|settle> upon this when he solve the problem for me the craze for drink have seize him again and he order me to pull up outside a gin palace he <go|fling> in leave word that i should wait for him there he remain until <close|last> time and when he come out he be so far go that i know the game be in my own hand don't imagine that i intend to kill him in cold blood it would only have be rigid justice if i have do so but i could not bring myself to do it i have long determine that he should have a show for his life if he choose to take advantage of it among the many billet which i have fill in america during my wander life i be once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at york college one day the professor be <lecture|rag> on poisions and he show his student some alkaloid a he call it which he have extract from some south american arrow poison and which be so powerful that the least grain mean instant <death|decease> i <spot|recognize> the bottle in which this preparation be keep and when they be all go i help myself to a little of it i be a <fairly|pretty> good dispenser so <i|single> <work|employment> this alkaloid into small soluble pill and each pill i put in a box with a similar pill make without the poison <i|single> determine at the time that when i have my chance my gentleman should each have a draw out of one of these box while i eat the pill that remain it would be quite a deadly and a good deal le noisy than fire across a handkerchief from that <day|daylight>

back in an hour i <sit|seat> in the window with the volume in my hand but my <thought|intend> be far from the dare speculation of the writer my mind run upon our <late|former> visitor her smile the deep rich tone of her voice the strange mystery which overhang her life if she be seventeen at the time of her father's disappearance she must be seven and twenty now a sweet age when youth have lose it self consciousness and <become|go> a little <sober|grave> by experience so <i|single> sit and muse until such dangerous thought come into my head that i hurry away to my desk and plunge furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology what be i an army surgeon with a <weak|feeble> leg and a weaker bank <account|chronicle> that i should dare to think of such thing she be a unit a <factor|agent> nothing more if my future be black it be better surely to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will o' the wisp of the imagination it be half past five before holmes return he be bright eager and in excellent spirit a mood which in his case alternate with fit of the <blackest|black> depression there be no great <mystery|secret> in this <matter|thing> he say take the cup of tea which i have pour out for him the fact appear to <admit|allow> of only one explanation what you have solve it already <well|considerably> that would <be|follow> too much to say i have discover a suggestive fact that be all it be however very suggestive the detail be <still|yet> to be add i have just find on consult the back file of the time that major sholto of upper norword late of the 34th bombay <infantry|foot> die upon the 28th of april i may <be|follow> very obtuse holmes but i fail to <see|find> what this suggest no you surprise me <look|appear> at it in this way then captain morstan disappear the only person in london whom he could have visit be major sholto major sholto deny <have|take> hear that he be in london four year <later|afterward> sholto die within a week of his death captain morstan's daughter <receive|find> a valuable present which be <repeat|duplicate> from <year|class> to year and now culminate in a letter which describe her a a wrong woman what wrong can it refer to except this <deprivation|loss> of her father and why should the present begin immediately after sholto's death unless it be that sholto's heir know something of the <mystery|secret> and desire to <make|do> compensation have you any alternative theory which will <meet|see> the fact but what a strange <compensation|recompense> and how strangely make why too should he write a letter now <rather|quite> than six year ago again the letter speak of <give|open> her justice what <justice|judge> can she have it be too much to suppose that her father be still alive there be no other injustice in her case that you <know|recognize> of there be difficulty there be certainly difficulty say sherlock holmes pensively but our expedition of to night will solve them all ah here be a four wheeler and miss morstan be inside be you all ready then we have better <go|get> down for it be a little past the <hour|minute> i pick up my hat and my heaviest <stick|stay> but i observe that holmes <take|remove> his revolver from his drawer and slip it into his pocket it be clear that he think that our night's work might be a serious one <miss|omit> morstan be muffle in a dark cloak and her sensitive face be compose but pale she must have be more than woman if she do not feel some <uneasiness|restlessness> at the strange enterprise upon which we be embark yet her self control be perfect and she readily answer the few additional question which sherlock holmes put to her major sholto be a very particular friend of papa's she say his letter be full of allusion to the major he and papa be in <command|statement> of the troop at the andaman island so they be throw a great <deal|cover> together by the <way|fashion> a curious <paper|composition> be find in papa's desk which no one could understand i don't suppose that it be of the <slightest|little> importance but i think you might care to see it <so|therefore> i bring it with me it be here holmes unfold the paper carefully and smooth it out upon his knee he then very methodically examine it all over with his double lens it be paper of native indian manufacture he remark it have at some time be pin to a board the diagram upon it appear to be a plan of part of a large build with numerous <hall|residence> corridor and passage at one point be a <small|humble> cross <do|make> in red ink and above it be from leave in fade pencil write in the leave hand <corner|tree> be a curious hieroglyphic like four cross in a <line|note> with their <arm|sleeve> touch beside it be write in very <rough|boisterous> and coarse character 'the sign of the four jonathan small mahomet singh abdullah khan dost akbar no i confess that i do not see how this bear upon the matter yet it be evidently a document of importance it have be keep carefully in a pocket <book|script> for the one side be a <clean|fresh> a the other it be in his pocket book that we find it preserve it carefully then miss morstan for it may prove to be of use to u i begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much deeper and more subtle than i at first suppose i must reconsider my <idea|estimation> he lean back in the cab and i could see by his <draw|cast> brow and his vacant eye that he <be|follow> think intently miss morstan and i chat in an undertone about our present expedition and it possible outcome but our companion maintain his impenetrable reserve until the end of our journey it be a september even and not yet seven o'clock but the day have be a dreary one and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great <city|metropolis> <mud|clay> color cloud <droop|flag> sadly over the muddy street down the strand the lamp be but misty splotch of diffuse light which throw a feeble circular glimmer upon the <slimy|unworthy> pavement the yellow glare from the shop window stream out into the steamy vaporous air and throw a murky shift <radiance|shine> across the crowd thoroughfare there be to my mind something <eerie|eery> and ghost like in the endless procession of face which flit across these narrow bar of <light|weak> sad face and glad haggard and merry like all human kind they flit from the gloom into the light and <so|indeed> back into the gloom once more i be not subject to impression but the dull heavy <even|still> with the strange business upon which we be engage combine to make me nervous and depress i could see from miss morstan's manner that she be suffer from the same feel holmes <alone|only> could rise superior to petty influence he hold his open note <book|hold> upon his knee and from time to time he jot down figure and memoranda in the light of his pocket lantern at the lyceum theatre the crowd be already thick at the side entrance in <front|movement> a continuous stream of hansom and four wheeler be rattle up discharge their cargo of shirt front men and beshawled bediamonded woman we have hardly reach the third pillar which be our rendezvous before a small dark brisk man in the

inside we have hardly do so before the driver whip up his horse and we plunge away at a furious pace through the foggy street the situation be a curious one we be drive to an unknown place on an unknown errand yet our invitation be either a complete hoax which be an inconceivable hypothesis or else we have good reason to think that important issue might hang upon our journey miss morstan's demeanor be a resolute and collect a ever i endeavor to cheer and amuse her by reminiscence of my adventure in afghanistan but to tell the truth i be myself so excite at our situation and so curious a to our destination that my story be slightly involve to this day she declare that i tell her one move anecdote a to how a musket look into my tent at the <dead|numb> of night and how i fire a <double|treble> barrel tiger cub at it at first i have some idea a to the direction in which we be drive but <soon|shortly> what with our pace the fog and my own limit knowledge of london i lose my

associate with the well know surrey family of the roylotts of stoke moran the event in question occur in the early day of my association with holmes when we be share room a bachelor in baker street it be possible that i might have place them upon record before but a promise of <secrecy|concealment> be make at the time from which i have only be free during the last month by the untimely death of the

be in the central block of the build of these bedroom the first be dr roylott's the second my sister's and the third my own there be no communication between them but they all <open|give> out into the same corridor <do|come> i make myself plain perfectly so the window of the three room <open|give> out upon the lawn that fatal night dr roylott have go to his room early though we know that he have not retire to rest for my sister be trouble by the <smell|scent> of the strong indian cigar which it be his <custom|usage> to smoke she leave her room therefore and come into mine where she sit for some time chat about her approach wed at eleven o'clock she rise to leave me but she pause at the door and look back 'tell me helen say she 'have you ever hear anyone whistle in the dead of the night 'never say i 'i suppose that you could not possibly whistle yourself in your sleep 'certainly not but why 'because during the last few <night|dark> i <have|give> always about three in the morning hear a low clear whistle i be a light sleeper and it have awaken me i cannot tell where it come from perhaps from the next room perhaps from the lawn i think that i would just ask you whether you <have|make> hear it 'no i <have|let> not it must be those wretched gipsy in the plantation 'very likely and yet if it be on the lawn i wonder that you do not hear it also 'ah but i sleep more heavily than you 'well it be of no great consequence at <any|whatever> rate she smile back at me close my <door|threshold> and a few moment later i hear her key turn in the lock indeed say holmes be it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night always and why i think that <i|single> mention to you that the doctor keep a cheetah and a baboon we have no feel of security unless our door be lock quite so pray <proceed|continue> with your statement i could not sleep that night a vague feel of impend misfortune impress me my sister and i you will recollect be twin and you know how subtle be the link which bind two soul which be so closely ally it be a wild night the wind be howl outside and the rain be beat and splash against the window suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale there burst forth the wild scream of a terrify woman i know that it be my sister's voice i spring from my bed wrap a shawl round me and rush into the corridor a i open my door i seem to hear a low whistle such a my sister describe and a few moment later a clang sound a if a mass of metal have fall a i run down the passage my sister's door be unlock and revolve slowly upon it hinge i star at it horror stricken not know what be about to issue from it by the light of the corridor lamp i <saw|see> my sister appear at the open her face blanch with terror her hand grope for help her whole figure sway to and fro like that of a drunkard i run to her and throw my arm <round|circular> her but at that moment her knee seem to give way and she fell to the grind she writhe a one who be in terrible pain and her limb be dreadfully convulse at first i <think|consider> that she have not recognise me but a i bend over her she <suddenly|abruptly> shriek out in a voice which i shall never forget 'oh my <god|immortal> helen it be the band the speckle <band|set> there be something else which she would fain have say and she stab with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor's <room|board> but a fresh convulsion seize her and choke her word i rush out call loudly for my stepfather and i meet him hasten from his room in his dress gown when he reach my sister's side she be unconscious and though he pour brandy down her throat and <send|commit> for medical aid from the village all effort be in vain for she slowly sink and die without have recover her consciousness such be the dreadful end of my beloved <sister|baby> one moment say holmes <be|follow> you sure about this whistle and metallic sound could you swear to it that be what the county coroner ask me at the inquiry it <be|follow> my <strong|hard> <impression|opinion> that i hear it and yet among the <crash|clang> of the gale and the creak of an old house i may possibly <have|take> be deceive be your sister dress no she be in her night <dress|clothe> in her <right|good> hand be find the char stump of a match and in her leave a match box show that she have strike a <light|easy> and look about her when the alarm <take|assume> place that be important and what <conclusion|determination> do the coroner come to he investigate the case with great <care|aid> for dr roylott's conduct have long be notorious in the county but he be unable to find any satisfactory cause of death my evidence show that the door have be fasten upon the inner side and the window be block by old <fashion|way> shutter with broad <iron|press> <bar|stop> which be secure every night the wall be carefully sound and be show to be quite <solid|substantial> all <round|attack> and the <floor|dump> be also thoroughly examine with the same result the chimney be wide but be bar up by four large staple it be certain therefore that my <sister|baby> be quite alone when she meet her end besides there <be|follow> no mark of any violence upon her how <about|around> poison the doctor examine her for it but without success what do you <think|remember> that this unfortunate lady die of <then|so> it be my belief that she <die|go> of <pure|virtuous> fear and <nervous|anxious> shock though what it be that frighten her i cannot imagine <be|follow> there gipsy in the plantation at the <time|clip> yes there be nearly always some there ah and what do you gather from this allusion to a band a speckle band sometimes i have <think|believe> that it be merely the wild talk of delirium sometimes that it may have refer to some band of people perhaps to these very gipsy in the plantation i do not know whether the spot handkerchief which <so|then> many of them <wear|assume> over their head might have suggest the <strange|unknown> adjective which she <use|apply> holmes shake his head like a man who be far from be satisfy these be very deep water say he pray go on with your narrative two year have pas since then and my life <have|let> be until lately lonelier than ever a month ago <however|yet> a <dear|costly> friend whom i have know for many year have do me the honour to <ask|expect> my hand in marriage <have|make> you <any|whatever> objection to my look at your register say holmes not in the least the book show that two name <have|let> be add after that of baskerville one be theophilus <johnson|President_Johnson> and family of newcastle the other mr oldmore and maid of high lodge alton surely that must be the same johnson whom i use to know say holmes to the porter a lawyer <be|follow> he not gray head and walk with a limp no sir this <be|follow> mr johnson the <coal|char> owner a very <active|alive> gentleman not <older|previous> than yourself surely you be mistake about his trade no sir he have use this hotel for many year and he be very well <know|recognize> to u ah that settle it mr oldmore too i <seem|appear> to remember the name excuse my curiosity but often in call upon one friend one <find|regain> another she be an invalid lady sir her husband be once mayor of gloucester she always come to u when she be in town thank you i be afraid i cannot claim her acquaintance we have establish a most <important|significant> fact by these <question|interview> watson he continue in a <low|humble> voice a we go upstairs together we know now that the people who be so <interest|sake> in our friend have not settle down in his own hotel that mean that while they be a we have see very <anxious|uneasy> to watch him they be equally anxious that he should not see them now this be a most suggestive fact what do it suggest it suggest halloa my dear <fellow|familiar> what on earth be the matter a we <come|get> round the top of the stair we have run up against sir henry baskerville himself his face be flush with anger and he hold an old and dusty boot in one of his hand <so|then> furious be he that he be hardly articulate and when he do speak it be in a much broader and more western dialect than any which we have hear from him in the morning seem to me they be play me for a sucker in this hotel he cry they'll find they've start in to monkey with the wrong man unless they be careful by thunder if that chap can't find my miss boot there will be trouble i can take a joke with the best mr holmes but they've get a bite over the mark this time still look for your boot yes sir and mean to <find|see> it but surely you say that it be a new brown boot so it <be|follow> sir and now it's an old black one what you don't mean to say that's just what <i|single> do mean to say i only have three pair in the world the new brown the old black and the patent leather which i be wear <last|live> <night|dark> they take one of my brown one and today they have sneak one of the black well have you get it speak out man and don't stand <star|genius> an agitate german waiter <have|make> appear upon the scene no sir i have make inquiry all over the hotel but i can hear no <word|news> of it well either that boot come back before sundown or i'll see the manager and tell him that i go <right|justly> straight out of this hotel it shall be find sir i promise you that if you will have a little patience it will be find mind it be for it's the <last|final> thing of mine that i'll lose in this den of thieve well well mr holmes you'll excuse my <trouble|bother> you about such a trifle i think it's well worth trouble about why you <look|see> very serious over it how do you explain it i just don't attempt to explain it it seem the very maddest queerest <thing|matter> that ever happen to me the <queerest|curious> perhaps say holmes thoughtfully what do you make of it yourself well i don't profess to understand it yet this case of yours be very complex sir henry when <take|shoot> in conjunction with your uncle's death i be not <sure|certain> that of all the five hundred case of <capital|cap> importance which i have handle there be one which cut so deep but we hold several thread in our <hand|deal> and the odds be that one or other of them guide u to the truth we may waste time in follow the wrong one but sooner or <later|late> we must come upon the right we have a pleasant luncheon in which little be say of the <business|job> which <have|let> bring u together it be in the <private|individual> sit room to which we afterwards repair that holmes <ask|take> baskerville what be his <intention|aim> to go to baskerville hall and when at the end of the week on the whole say holmes i <think|consider> that your decision be a wise one i have ample evidence that you be be dog in london and amid the million of this great city it be difficult to discover who these people be or what their object can be if their intention <be|follow> evil they might do you a mischief and we should be powerless to prevent it you do not know dr mortimer that you be follow this morning from my house dr mortimer start violently follow by whom that unfortunately be what i cannot tell you <have|give> you among your neighbour or acquaintance on dartmoor any man with a black full beard no or let me see why yes barrymore sir charles's butler be a <man|valet> with a <full|good> black beard ha where be barrymore he be in charge of the <hall|mansion> we have <best|effective> ascertain if he be really there or if by any possibility he might be in london how can you do that give me a telegraph <form|cast> 'is all ready for sir henry that will do address to mr barrymore baskerville hall what be the nearest telegraph office grimpen very good we will send a second <wire|telegraph> to the postmaster grimpen 'telegram to mr barrymore to be deliver into his own hand if absent please return <wire|cable> to sir henry baskerville northumberland hotel that should let u know before even whether barrymore be at his post in devonshire or not that's so say baskerville by the way dr mortimer who be this barrymore anyhow he be the son of the old caretaker who be dead they have <look|expect> after the <hall|residence> for four generation now so far a i know he and his wife be a respectable a couple a any in the county at the same time say baskerville it's clear enough that so long a there be none of the family at the hall these people have a <mighty|powerful> fine <home|house> and nothing to do that be true <do|come> barrymore profit at all by sir charles's will ask holmes he and his wife have five hundred pound each ha do they know that they would receive this yes sir charles be very fond of talk about the provision of his will that be very interest i hope say dr mortimer that you do not look with <suspicious|wary> eye upon everyone who receive a legacy from sir charles for i also have a thousand pound leave to me indeed and anyone else there be many insignificant sum to <individual|single> and a large number of public charity the residue all go to sir henry and how much be the residue seven hundred and forty thousand pound holmes raise his <eyebrow|brow> in surprise i have no idea that so gigantic a sum be involve say he sir charles have the reputation of be rich but we do not know how very rich he <be|follow> until we come to examine his <security|surety> the total <value|appreciate> of the estate <be|follow> close <on|along> to a million <dear|near> me it be a stake for which a man might well play a desperate game and one more <question|head> dr mortimer suppose that anything happen to our young friend here you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis who would inherit the estate since rodger baskerville sir charles's younger <brother|chum> die unmarried the estate would descend to the desmonds who be distant cousin jam desmond be an <elderly|senior> clergyman in westmoreland thank you these detail be all of great interest have you meet mr jam desmond yes he once come down to <visit|see> sir charles he be a man of venerable appearance and of saintly life i remember that he refuse to accept any <settlement|resolution> from sir charles though he press it upon him and this man of simple taste would <be|follow> the <heir|successor> to sir charles's thousand he would be the heir to the estate because that be entail he would also be the heir to the money unless it be will otherwise by the present owner who can of course do what he like with it and have you make your will sir henry no mr holmes i have not i've have no time for it be only yesterday that i learn how matter stand but in any case i feel that the money should go with the <title|style> and estate that be my poor uncle's idea how be the owner go to restore the glory of the baskervilles if he <have|give> not money enough to keep up the property house land and dollar must go together quite so well sir henry i be of one mind with you a to the advisability of your go down to devonshire without <delay|hold> there be only one provision which i must make you <certainly|surely> must not go alone dr mortimer return with me but dr mortimer have his practice to attend to and his house be mile away from yours with all the goodwill in the world he may be unable to help you no sir henry you must take with you someone a trusty man who will be always by your side be it possible that you could come yourself mr holmes if matter come to a crisis i should endeavour to be present in person but you can understand that with my extensive consult practice and with the <constant|perpetual> appeal which reach me from many quarter it be impossible for me to be absent from london for an indefinite time at the present <instant|second> one of the <most|nearly> revere name in england be be besmirch by a blackmailer and only i can stop a disastrous scandal you will see how impossible it be for me to go to dartmoor whom would you recommend then holmes lay his hand upon my <arm|sleeve> if my friend would undertake it there be no <man|human> who be better worth have at your <side|slope> when you be in a tight place no one can say so more confidently than i the proposition <take|consider> me completely by surprise but before i have time to <answer|do> baskerville seize me by the hand and wring it heartily well now that be real <kind|variety> of you dr watson say he you see how it be with me and you know just a much about the matter a i <do|make> if you will come down to baskerville hall and <see|realize> me through i'll never <forget|leave> it the <promise|call> of adventure have always a fascination for me and i be compliment by the word of holmes and by the eagerness with which the baronet hail me a a companion i will come with pleasure say i i do not know how i could employ my time better and you will report very carefully to me say holmes when a crisis come a it will do i will direct how you shall act i suppose that by saturday all might be ready would that suit dr watson perfectly then on saturday unless you hear to the contrary we shall <meet|see> at the ten thirty train from paddington we have <rise|develop> to depart when baskerville give a cry of triumph and dive into one of the corner of the room he draw a brown boot from under a cabinet my miss boot he cry may all our difficulty vanish a easily say sherlock holmes but it be a very singular thing dr mortimer <remark|note> i search this <room|board> carefully before lunch and so do i say baskerville every inch of it there be certainly no boot in it then in that case the waiter must have place it there while we <be|follow> lunch the german be send for but profess to know nothing of the matter nor could any inquiry clear it up another item have be add to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small mystery which have <succeed|follow> each other so rapidly <set|do> aside the whole grim story of sir charles's death we have a <line|air> of inexplicable incident all within the limit of two <day|daylight> which include the receipt of the print letter the black beard <spy|spot> in the hansom the loss of the new brown boot the loss of the <old|older> black boot and <now|immediately> the return of the new brown boot holmes sit in silence in the cab a we drive back to baker street and i know from his draw brow and keen <face|confront> that his mind like my own be busy in endeavour to frame some scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnect <episode|sequence> could be fit all afternoon

sir charles i have make some inquiry myself in the last few day but the result have i fear <be|follow> negative one thing only appear to be certain and that be that mr <jam|hole> desmond who be the next heir be an elderly gentleman of a very amiable disposition so that this persecution do not arise from him he be sit fully dress in an <easy|soft> chair with a slip of paper which <look|see> like a <map|represent> upon his knee and his forehead sink forward upon his hand in deep think i stand dumb with astonishment <watch|view> him from the darkness a small taper on the edge of the table shed a feeble light which suffice to show me that he be fully dress suddenly a i look he <rise|develop> from his <chair|lead> and walk over to a bureau at the side he unlock it and draw out one of the drawer from this he <take|consider> a <paper|report> and <return|deliver> to his seat he flatten it out beside the taper on the edge of the table and begin to study it with minute attention my indignation at this <calm|quiet> examination of our family document overcome me so far that i <take|have> a step forward and brunton look up saw me stand in the doorway he spring to his foot his face turn livid with fear and he thrust into his <breast|summit> the chart like paper which he have be originally study so say i this be how you repay the trust which we have repose in you you will leave my <service|help> to morrow 'he bow with the <look|aspect> of a man who be utterly crush and slink past me without a word the taper <be|follow> still on the <table|board> and by it light <i|single> glance to see what the paper be which brunton have take from the bureau to my surprise it be nothing of any importance at all but <simply|only> a copy of the question and answer in the singular old <observance|ceremonial> call the musgrave ritual it be a sort of ceremony peculiar to our family which each musgrave for century past have go through on his come of age a thing of private interest and <perhaps|maybe> of some little importance to the archaeologist like our own blazon and charge but of no practical <use|utilise> whatever 'we have better come back to the paper afterwards say i 'if you think it <really|truly> necessary he answer with some <hesitation|reluctance> 'to continue my statement however i relocked the bureau use the key which brunton have leave and i have <turn|tour> to go when i be surprise to <find|obtain> that the butler have return and <be|follow> stand before me mr musgrave sir he cry in a voice which be hoarse with emotion i can't bear <disgrace|shame> sir i've always be proud above my station in life and disgrace would kill me my <blood|rake> will be on your head sir it will indeed if you drive me to despair if you cannot keep me after what <have|make> pas

public disgrace upon you a month <however|still> be <too|also> <long|tenacious> take yourself away in a week and give what reason you like for go <only|entirely> a week sir he cry in a despair voice a fortnight say at least a fortnight a week i repeat and you may <consider|believe> yourself to have be very leniently deal with 'he creep away his face sink upon his breast like a break man while i put out the light and <return|retort> to my <room|way> 'for two day after this brunton be most assiduous in his <attention|aid> to his duty i make no allusion to what have pas and wait with some curiosity to see how he would cover his disgrace on the third morning however he do not appear a be his custom after breakfast to <receive|find> my instruction for the day a i leave the din room i happen to meet rachel howells the maid i have tell you that she have only recently recover from an illness and be <look|appear> so wretchedly pale and wan that i <remonstrate|rag> with her for be at <work|study> you should be in bed i say <come|do> back to your <duty|responsibility> when you be stronger 'she look at me with so strange an expression that i begin to suspect that her <brain|wit> be

have disappear his bed have not be sleep in he have be see by no one since he have retire to his <room|way> the night before and yet it be difficult to see how he could have leave the house a both window and door be find to be fasten in the morning his clothe his watch and even his money be in his <room|board> but the black suit which he usually wear be miss his slipper too be go but his boot be leave behind where then could butler brunton have go in the night and what could <have|take> become of him now 'of course we search the house from cellar to garret but there be no <trace|describe> of him it be a i have say a labyrinth of an old house especially the original wing which be now practically uninhabited but we ransack every room and cellar without discover the least <sign|mark> of the miss <man|world> it be incredible to me that he could have <go|run> away leave all his property behind him and yet where could he be i call in the local police but without success rain have <fall|settle> on the night before and we examine the lawn and the <path|way> all round the house but in vain matter be in this state when a new <development|growth> quite draw our attention away from the original mystery 'for two day rachel howells have be so <ill|ominous> sometimes delirious sometimes hysterical that a nurse have be employ to sit up with her at <night|dark> on the third <night|dark> after brunton's disappearance the nurse find her patient sleep nicely have drop into a nap in the armchair when she wake in the <early|former> <morning|daybreak> to find the bed empty the window open and no sign of the invalid i be instantly arouse and with the two footman start off at once in search of the miss girl it be not difficult to tell the direction which she have <take|remove> for start from <under|below> her window we could <follow|come> her footmark easily across the lawn to the edge of the mere where they vanish close to the gravel path which lead out of the ground the lake there be eight foot deep and you can imagine our feel when we saw that the <trail|train> of the poor demented girl come to an <end|remainder> at the edge of it 'of course we have the drag at once and <set|do> to work to <recover|find> the <remain|rest> but no trace of the <body|consistence> could we find on the other <hand|deal> we <bring|add> to the surface an object of a most unexpected <kind|genial> it be a linen bag which <contain|take> within it a mass of old <rust|corrode> and discolour metal and several dull colour piece of pebble or glass this <strange|unknown> find be all that we could get from the mere and although we make every possible search and inquiry yesterday we know <nothing|naught> of the fate either of rachel howells or of richard brunton the county police be at their wits' end and i have come up to you a a last resource you can imagine watson with what eagerness i listen to this extraordinary sequence of event and endeavour to piece them together and to <devise|organize> some common thread upon which they might all <hang|cling> the butler be go the maid be go the maid have <love|know> the butler but have afterwards have <cause|make> to hate him she be of welsh blood fiery and passionate she have be terribly excite immediately after his <disappearance|fade> she <have|let> fling into the lake a bag contain some curious content these <be|follow> all factor which have to be take into consideration and yet none of them <get|make> quite to the heart of the <matter|count> what be the start point of this chain of event there lay the end of this tangle <line|strain> 'i must see that paper musgrave say i 'which this butler of yours think it worth his while to consult even at the <risk|adventure> of the loss of his place 'it be rather an absurd business this ritual of ours he answer 'but it have at least the save grace of antiquity to excuse it i have a copy of the question and answer here if you care to run your eye over them he hand me the very paper which i have here watson and this be the strange catechism to which each musgrave have to submit when he come to man's estate i will read you the question and answer a they stand 'whose be it 'his who <be|follow> go 'who shall have it 'he who will come 'where be the sun 'over the oak 'where be the shadow 'under the elm how be it step 'north by ten and by ten east by five and by five south by two and by two <west|westward> by one and by one and so under 'what shall we give for it 'all that be ours 'why should we give it 'for the sake of the trust 'the original have no <date|appointment> but be in the spell of the middle of the seventeenth century remark musgrave 'i be afraid however that it can be of little help to you in solve this mystery 'at least say i 'it give u another mystery and one which be even more interest than the <first|low> it may be that the solution of the one may prove to be the solution of the other you will <excuse|apologize> me musgrave if i say that your butler appear to me to have be a very clever man and to have have a clearer insight than ten generation of his master 'i hardly follow you say musgrave 'the paper seem to me to be of no practical importance 'but to me it seem immensely practical and i fancy that brunton take the same <view|horizon> he have <probably|plausibly> <see|realize> it before that night on which you catch him 'it be very possible we take no pain to <hide|fell> it 'he simply wish i should imagine to refresh his memory upon that last occasion he have a i understand some <sort|kind> of map or chart which he be compare with the manuscript and which he thrust into his pocket when you appear 'that be true but what could he have to do with this old family custom of ours and what do this rigmarole <mean|signify> 'i don't think that we should have much difficulty in determine that say i 'with your permission we will take the first train down to sussex and go a little more deeply into the matter upon the <spot|fleck> the same afternoon saw u both at hurlstone possibly you have <see|realize> picture and read description of the famous old build so i will confine my <account|history> of it to say that it be build in the shape of an l the <long|tenacious> arm be the more modern portion and the shorter the ancient nucleus from which the other have develop over the low heavily lintelled door in the centre of this old <part|contribution> be chisel the date but expert be agree that the <beam|shine> and stonework be really much <older|previous> than this the enormously thick wall and tiny window of this part have in the last century drive the <family|category> into build the new <wing|fly> and the old one be use now a a storehouse and a cellar when it be use at all a splendid park with fine old timber surround the house and the lake to which my client have refer lay close to the avenue about two hundred yard from the <build|figure> i be already firmly convince watson that there be not three separate mystery here but one only and that if i could <read|say> the musgrave ritual aright i should <hold|have> in my hand the clue which would lead me to the truth concern both the butler brunton and the maid howells to that then i turn all my energy why should this servant be so anxious to master this old formula <evidently|obviously> because he saw something in it which <have|make> escape all those generation of country squire and from which he expect some personal advantage what be it then and how have it affect his fate it be perfectly obvious to me on read the ritual that the measurement must refer to some spot to which the <rest|pillow> of the document allude and that if we could find that spot we should be in a <fair|average> way towards find what the secret be which the old musgraves have think it necessary to embalm in so curious a fashion there be two guide give u to start with an oak and an elm a to the oak there could be no question at all right in front of the house upon the leave hand side of the <drive|campaign> there stand a patriarch among oak one of the <most|nearly> magnificent tree that i have ever see 'that be there when your ritual be draw up say i a we drive past it 'it be there at the norman conquest in all probability he answer 'it have a girth of twenty three <foot|infantry> 'have you any old elm i ask 'there <use|apply> to be a very old one over yonder but it <be|follow> strike by lightning ten year ago and we <cut|swing> down the stump 'you can <see|find> where it <use|apply> to be 'oh yes 'there be no other elm 'no old one but plenty of beech 'i should like to see where it grow we have drive up in a dog cart and my client <lead|take> me away at once without our <enter|introduce> the house to the scar on the lawn where the elm have stand it be nearly midway between the oak and the <house|sign> my investigation seem to be progress 'i <suppose|theorize> it be impossible to find out how high the elm be i ask 'i can give you it at once it <be|follow> sixty four foot 'how <do|come> you come to know it i <ask|expect> in <surprise|storm> 'when my old tutor <use|utilise> to give me an exercise in trigonometry it always take the <shape|work> of measure height when i be a lad i work out every tree and build in the estate this be an unexpected piece of luck my data be come more quickly than i could have reasonably hop 'tell me i ask 'did your butler ever <ask|take> you such a question reginald musgrave look at me in astonishment 'now that you call it to my mind he answer 'brunton _did_ ask me about the height of the tree some month ago in connection with some little argument with the groom this be excellent news watson for it show me that i be on the right road i <look|see> up at the sun it be low in the heaven and i calculate that in le than an hour it would lie just above the topmost branch of the <old|former> oak one <condition|shape> mention in the <ritual|rite> would then be fulfil and the shadow of the elm must mean the farther end of the shadow <otherwise|differently> the trunk would have be choose a the <guide|point> i <have|make> then to find where the far end of the shadow would fall when the sun be just clear of the oak that must have be difficult holmes when the elm be no longer there well at least i know that if brunton could do it i could also besides there be no real difficulty i go with musgrave to his study and whittle myself this <peg|nail> to which i tie this long string with a knot at each yard then i take two length of a fish rod which come to just six foot and i go back with my client to where the elm have be the sun be just graze the top of the oak i fasten the rod on end <mark|print> out the direction of the shadow and measure it it be nine foot in length of course the calculation now be a <simple|elementary> one if a rod of six foot throw a shadow of nine a tree of sixty four foot would throw one of ninety six and the line of the one would of <course|trend> be the <line|wrinkle> of the other i measure out the distance which bring me almost to the wall of the house and i thrust a peg into the <spot|blot> you can imagine my exultation watson when within two inch of my <peg|nail> i saw a conical depression in the grind i know that it be the mark make by brunton in his measurement and that i be still upon his trail from this start point i proceed to step <have|give> first take the cardinal point by my pocket <compass|apprehend> ten step with each foot take me along parallel with the <wall|fence> of the house and again <i|single> mark my <spot|point> with a peg then i carefully pace off five to the east and two to the south it bring me to the very threshold of the <old|older> <door|doorway> two step to the west mean now that i be to <go|run> two pace down the stone <flag|pin> passage and this be the place <indicate|argue> by the ritual never have i felt such a cold <chill|tingle> of disappointment watson for a moment it seem to me that there must be some radical <mistake|fault> in my calculation the set sun <shine|strike> full upon the passage floor and i could see that the old foot wear grey stone with which it be pave be firmly cement together and have certainly not be <move|incite> for many a long <year|twelvemonth> brunton have not <be|follow> at work here i tap upon the floor but it sound the same all over and there be no <sign|bless> of any crack or crevice but fortunately musgrave who have begin to appreciate the mean of my proceed and who be now a <excite|agitate> a myself take out his manuscript to check my calculation 'and under he cry 'you have omit the and under i <have|make> think that it mean that we be to <dig|digging> but now of course i saw at once that i be wrong 'there be a cellar under this <then|so> i cry 'yes and a old a the house down here through this door we go down a wind stone stair and my companion <strike|attain> a match light a large lantern which stand on a barrel in the corner in an instant it be obvious that we <have|get> at last <come|total> upon the true <place|office> and that we have not be the only people to visit the spot recently it have be use for the storage of wood but the billet which have evidently be litter over the <floor|level> be now <pile|down> at the side so a to <leave|will> a clear space in the middle in this space <lay|repose> a large and heavy flagstone with a rust iron ring in the centre to which a thick shepherd's <check|ensure> muffler <be|follow> attach 'by jove <cry|squall> my client that s brunton's muffler i have <see|ensure> it <on|along> him and could swear to it what <have|take> the villain be do here at my suggestion a couple of the county police <be|follow> summon to be present and i <then|so> endeavour to raise the stone by <pull|force> on the cravat i could <only|entirely> <move|run> it slightly and it be with the aid of one of the constable that <i|single> <succeed|follow> at last in carry it to one side a black <hole|trap> yawn beneath into which we all peer while musgrave kneel at the side push down the lantern a small chamber about seven foot <deep|inscrutable> and four <foot|base> square lay open to u at one <side|face> of this be a squat brass bind wooden box the lid of which be hinge upwards with this curious old fashion key project from the lock it <be|follow> <then|so> that i write and send the paper to you mr holmes it be not a thing that i could take to the police for they would have laugh at me but you will <tell|say> me what to <do|come> i be not a rich man but if there be any danger threaten my little woman i would spend my last copper to shield her he be a fine creature this man of the old english soil simple straight and gentle with his great earnest <blue|dingy> eye and broad comely face his love for his wife and his trust in her shine in his feature holmes have listen to his <story|chronicle> with the utmost <attention|care> and now he sit for some time in silent <think|remember> don't you think mr cubitt say he at last that your best plan would be to make a direct appeal to your wife and to ask her to share her secret with you hilton cubitt shake his massive head a promise be a promise mr holmes if elsie wish to tell me she would if not it be not for me to force her confidence but i be justify in <take|have> my own line and i will then i will help you with all my <heart|meat> in the first place have you hear of any stranger be see in your neighbourhood no i <presume|assume> that it be a very quiet place <any|whatever> fresh <face|confront> would cause comment in the immediate neighbourhood yes but we have several small water place not very far away and the farmer take in lodger these hieroglyphic have evidently a mean if it be a purely arbitrary one it may be <impossible|inconceivable> for u to solve it if on the other hand it be systematic i have no doubt that we shall get to the bottom of it but this particular sample be so short that i can do <nothing|cipher> and the fact which you have bring me be so indefinite that we <have|make> no basis for an investigation i would suggest that you return to norfolk that you keep a keen look out and that you take an exact copy of any fresh dance men which may appear it be a thousand pity that we have not a reproduction of those which be <do|make> in <chalk|crank> upon the window sill make a discreet inquiry also a to any <stranger|strange> in the neighbourhood when you <have|give> collect some fresh evidence come to me again that be the best advice which i can give you mr hilton cubitt if there be any press fresh development i shall be always ready to run down and see you in your norfolk <home|domicile> the interview leave sherlock holmes <very|really> thoughtful and <several|various> time in the next few day i saw him take his slip of paper from his note book and look <long|tenacious> and earnestly at the curious figure inscribe upon it he <make|establish> no allusion to the affair however until one afternoon a fortnight or so later i be go out when he call me back you have better stay here watson why because i have a wire from hilton cubitt this morning you remember hilton cubitt of the dance men he be to reach liverpool street at one twenty he may be here at any moment i gather from his wire that there have be some new incident of importance we have not long to wait for our norfolk squire come <straight|directly> from the station a fast a a hansom could bring him he be look worry and depress with tire eye and a line forehead it's get on my <nerve|mettle> this business mr holmes say he a he sink like a weary man into an arm chair it's bad enough to feel that you be surround by unseen unknown folk who have some <kind|form> of design upon you but when in addition to that you know that it be <just|simply> kill your wife by inch then it become a much a flesh and blood can endure she's wear <away|aside> under it just <wear|assume> away before my eye have she say anything yet no mr holmes she have not and yet there have be time when the <poor|miserable> girl have want to speak and yet could not <quite|rather> bring herself to take the plunge i have try to help her but i dare say i do it clumsily and scar her off from it she have speak about my old <family|household> and our reputation in the county and our pride in our unsullied honour and i always felt it be lead to the point but somehow it turn off before we get there but you have find out something for yourself a good deal mr holmes i have several fresh dance men picture for you to examine and what be more important i <have|get> see the fellow what the man who draw them yes i saw him at his work but i will <tell|say> you everything in order when i get back after my visit to you the very first <thing|affair> i saw next <morning|aurora> <be|follow> a <fresh|new> crop of dance <men|world> they have be draw in chalk upon the black wooden door of the <tool|creature> house which stand beside the lawn in full view of the <front|movement> window i take an exact copy and here it be he unfold a paper and lay it upon the <table|postpone> here be a copy of the hieroglyphic graphic excellent say holmes excellent pray continue when i have take the copy i rub out the mark but two <morning|aurora> later a fresh inscription have appear i have a copy of it here graphic holmes rub his hand and chuckle with delight our material be rapidly accumulate say he three day later a message be leave scrawl upon paper and place under a pebble upon the sun dial here it be the character be a you see exactly the same a the last one after that i <determine|see> to lie in <wait|delay> <so|thus> i get out my revolver and i sit up in my study which overlook the lawn and garden about two in the morning i be <seat|can> by the window all be dark save for the moonlight outside when i <hear|see> step behind me and there be my wife in her <dress|garment> gown she implore me to come to bed i tell her frankly that i wish to see who it be who play such absurd trick upon u she answer that it be some <senseless|superfluous> practical joke and that i should not <take|remove> any notice of it 'if it really annoy you hilton we might go and <travel|go> you and i and <so|thus> avoid this nuisance 'what be drive out of our own house by a practical joker say <i|single> 'why we should <have|make> the whole county laugh at u 'well come to bed say she 'and we can discus it in the morning <suddenly|abruptly> a she speak i saw her white face grow whiter yet in the moonlight and her hand tighten upon my shoulder something be move in the shadow of the tool house i saw a dark creep <figure|form> which crawl round the corner and squat in <front|presence> of the door <seize|assume> my pistol i be rush out when my wife throw her arm round me and hold me with convulsive strength i try to <throw|make> her off but she cling to me most desperately at last i get clear but by the time i have open the door and reach the <house|home> the creature be go he <have|get> leave a trace of his presence however for there on the door be the very same arrangement of dance men which have already twice appear and which i have copy on that paper there be no other sign of the <fellow|comrade> anywhere though <i|single> run all over the <ground|land> and yet the amaze thing be that he must have be there all the <time|clip> for when i examine the door again in the morning he have scrawl some more of his picture under the line which i have already see <have|let> you that fresh draw yes it be very short but i make a copy of it and here it be again he produce a paper the new dance be in this form <graphic|vivid> <tell|say> me say holmes and i could see by his eye that he be much excite be this a mere <addition|gain> to the first or <do|come> it appear to be entirely separate it be <on|along> a different panel of the door excellent this be far the most important of all for our purpose it fill me with hop now mr hilton cubitt please continue your most <interest|pursuit> statement i have nothing more to say mr holmes except that i be angry with my wife that night for have hold me back when i might have catch the skulk rascal she say that she fear that i might come to harm for an instant it have cross my <mind|listen> that perhaps what she really fear be that he might come to harm for i could not doubt that she know who this man be and what he mean by these strange signal but there be a tone in my wife's voice mr holmes and a look in her eye which forbid doubt and i be sure that it be indeed my own safety that <be|follow> in her mind there's the whole case and now <i|single> want your advice a to what i ought to do my own inclination be to put half a dozen of my <farm|produce> lad in the shrubbery and when this fellow come again to give him such a hide that he will leave u in peace for the future i fear it be <too|likewise> deep a case for such simple remedy say holmes how long can you stay in london i must go back to day i would not leave my wife alone all night for anything she be very nervous and beg me to come back i dare say you be right but if you could have stop i might possibly have be able to <return|homecoming> with you in a day or two meanwhile you will leave me these <paper|composition> and <i|single> think that it be very likely that i shall be able to pay you a visit <shortly|curtly> and to throw some light upon your case sherlock holmes preserve his calm professional manner until our visitor have leave u although it be easy for me who know him so well to see that he be profoundly excite the moment that hilton cubitt's <broad|wide> back have disappear through the door my comrade rush to the table lay out all the slip of paper contain dance men in front of him and throw himself into an intricate and elaborate calculation for two hour i watch him a he cover sheet after sheet of paper with figure and letter so completely absorb in his task that he have evidently forget my <presence|front> sometimes he be make <progress|advancement> and whistle and sing at his work sometimes he be <puzzle|get> and would sit for long spell with a <furrow|chase> brow and a vacant eye <finally|eventually> he spring from his chair with a cry of satisfaction and walk up and down the room rub his hand together then he write a long telegram upon a cable form if my answer to this be a <i|single> hope you will have a very pretty case to add to your collection watson say he i expect that we shall be able to go down to norfolk to morrow and to take our friend some very definite news a to the <secret|underground> of his annoyance i confess that i be fill with <curiosity|peculiarity> but i be aware that holmes like to make his disclosure at his own time and in his own way so i wait until it should suit him to <take|make> me into his confidence but there be a delay in that answer telegram and two day of impatience follow during which holmes <prick|sting> up his ear at every ring of the bell on the even of the second there come a letter from hilton cubitt all be quiet with him save that a <long|tenacious> inscription <have|let> appear that morning upon the pedestal of the sun dial he inclose a copy of it which be here reproduce graphic holmes bend over this grotesque frieze for some minute and then suddenly spring to his foot with an exclamation of surprise and dismay his face be haggard with anxiety we have let this affair go far enough say he be there a train to north walsham to night i turn up the time table the last have just go then we shall breakfast early and take the very first in the morning say holmes our presence be most urgently need ah here be our expect cablegram one <moment|instant> mr hudson there may be an answer no that <be|follow> quite a i expect this message make it even more essential that we should not lose an hour in let hilton cubitt know how matter stand for it be a <singular|remarkable> and a dangerous web in which our <simple|bare> norfolk squire be entangle so indeed it prove and a i come to the dark conclusion of a story which have seem to me to be only childish and bizarre i experience once again the <dismay|deject> and horror with which i <be|follow> <fill|take> would that i have some brighter end to communicate to my reader but these be the <chronicle|account> of fact and i must follow to their dark crisis the strange <chain|string> of event which for some day make ridling thorpe manor a household word through the length and breadth of england we have hardly alight at north walsham and mention the name of our destination when the station <master|overcome> hurry towards u i suppose that you be the detective from london say he a look of <annoyance|vexation> pas over holmes's face what make you <think|consider> such a thing because inspector martin from norwich have just pas through but maybe you be the surgeon she's not dead or wasn't by last account you may be in time to save her yet though it be for the gallows holmes's brow be dark with anxiety we be go to ridling thorpe manor say he but we have hear nothing of what have pas there it's a terrible business say the station master they be shoot both mr hilton cubitt and his wife she <shoot|take> him and then herself so the servant say he's dead and her life <be|follow> despair of dear dear one of the oldest family in the county of norfolk and one of the <most|almost> honour without a word holmes hurry to a <carriage|posture> and during the long seven miles' drive he never open his mouth seldom <have|let> i see him so utterly despondent he have be uneasy during all our journey from town and i have observe that he have <turn|go> over the morning paper with anxious attention but now this sudden realization of his worst <fear|care> leave him in a blank melancholy he lean back in his seat lose in gloomy speculation yet there <be|follow> <much|practically> around to interest u for we be pas through a singular a country side a any in england where a few scatter cottage represent the population of to day while on every hand enormous square tower church bristle up from the flat green landscape and tell of the glory and prosperity of <old|former> east anglia at last the violet rim of the german ocean appear over the green edge of the norfolk coast and the driver point with his whip to two old brick and timber gable which project from a grove of tree that's ridling thorpe manor say he a we drive up to the porticoed front door i observe in front of it beside the tennis lawn the black <tool|cock> house and the pedestalled sun dial with which we have such <strange|unusual> association a dapper little <man|piece> with a quick alert manner and a wax moustache have just descend from a high <dog|chase> <cart|drag> he introduce himself a inspector martin of the norfolk constabulary and he be considerably astonish when he hear the name of my companion why mr holmes the crime <be|follow> only commit at three this morning how could you hear of it in london and <get|let> to the spot a soon a i i anticipate it i <come|do> in the hope of <prevent|forbid> it then you must have important evidence of which we be ignorant for they be say to be a <most|nearly> unite couple i have only the evidence of the dance men say holmes i <will|leave> explain the matter to you <later|late> meanwhile since it be too late to prevent this tragedy i be very anxious that i should use the knowledge which i posse in order to ensure that justice be do will you associate me in your investigation or <will|leave> you prefer that i should act independently i should be proud to feel that we be act together mr holmes say the inspector earnestly in that case i should be glad to hear the evidence and to examine the premise without an <instant|moment> of unnecessary delay inspector martin have the good sense to allow my friend to do <thing|affair> in his own fashion and content himself with carefully note the <result|ensue> the local surgeon an old white haired <man|valet> have just come down from mr hilton cubitt's room and he report that her injury be serious but not necessarily fatal the bullet have pas through the front of her brain and it would probably be some time before she could regain consciousness on the <question|doubt> of whether she have be shoot or have <shoot|take> herself he would not <venture|embark> to express any decide opinion certainly the bullet have be discharge at very close quarter there <be|follow> only the one pistol find in the room two barrel of which have be empty mr hilton cubitt have be shoot through the heart it be equally conceivable that he have <shoot|take> her and then himself or that she have be the criminal for the revolver lay upon the floor midway between them have he be move ask holmes we have move nothing except the lady we could not leave her <lie|dwell> wound upon the floor how long have you be here doctor since four o'clock anyone else yes the constable here and you have touch nothing <nothing|cipher> you have act with great discretion who send for you the housemaid saunders <be|follow> it she who give the alarm she and mr king the cook where be they now in the kitchen i believe then i think we have better hear their story at once the old hall oak panel and high windowed have be <turn|go> into a court of investigation holmes sit in a <great|big> old fashion chair his inexorable eye gleam out of his <haggard|bony> face i could read in them a set purpose to devote his life to this quest until the client whom he have fail to <save|keep> should at last be avenge the trim inspector martin the old grey head country doctor myself and a <stolid|impassive> village policeman make up the rest of that strange company the two woman tell their story clearly enough they have <be|follow> arouse from their sleep by the sound of an explosion which have be follow a <minute|instant> later by a second one they sleep in <adjoin|contact> room and mr king <have|take> rush in to saunders together they <have|make> descend the stair the door of the study be open and a candle be burn upon the table their <master|schoolmaster> lay upon his face in the <centre|meat> of the room he be <quite|rather> dead near the window his wife be crouch her head lean against the wall she <be|follow> horribly wound and the side of her face be red with blood she breathe heavily but be incapable of say anything the passage a <well|intimately> a the room be full of smoke and the smell of powder the window be certainly shut and fasten upon the inside both woman be positive upon the <point|signal> they have at once send for the <doctor|repair> and for the constable <then|so> with the aid of the groom and the stable boy they have convey their injure mistress to her room both she and her husband <have|take> occupy the bed she be clothe in her <dress|clothe> he in his dress gown over his night clothe nothing have be move in the <study|field> <so|therefore> far a they know there have never be any quarrel between husband and wife they have always look upon them a a very unite <couple|mate> these be the <main|independent> point of the servants' <evidence|show> in answer to inspector martin they be clear that every door be fasten upon the inside and that no <one|i> could have escape from the house he open one of his hand and look at a note crumple up in his palm <see|project> here mister he cry with a gleam of suspicion in his eye you're not try to scare me over this be you if the lady <be|follow> hurt a bad a you say who be it that

circumstance and the certainty that hilton cubitt <have|let> <fire|can> the first shoot of mr hilton cubitt i <only|alone> know that i have hear she recover entirely and that she still remain a widow devote her whole life to the care of the poor and to the administration of her husband's estate i have intend the adventure of the abbey grange to be the last of those exploit of my friend mr sherlock holmes which i should ever communicate to the public this <resolution|settlement> of mine be not due to any lack of material since i have <note|billet> of many hundred of case to which i have never allude nor be it <cause|do> by any wan interest on the part of my reader in the singular personality and unique method of this remarkable man the real reason lay in the reluctance which mr holmes have show to the continue publication of his experience so long a he be in actual professional practice the record of his success be of some practical value to him but since he have definitely retire from london and betaken himself to study and bee farm on the sussex down notoriety have become hateful to him and he have <peremptorily|imperatively> request that his wish in this <matter|affair> should be strictly observe it be only upon my represent to him that i have give a promise that the <adventure|stake> of the second stain should be publish when the time be ripe and point out to him that it be only appropriate that this long series of <episode|sequence> should culminate in the most important international case which he have ever be call upon to handle that i at last succeed in obtain his <consent|accept> that a carefully guard account of the incident should at last be lay before the public if in <tell|say> the story i <seem|appear> to be <somewhat|pretty> vague in certain detail the public <will|leave> readily understand that there be an excellent reason for my reticence it be then in a year and <even|still> in a decade that shall be nameless that upon one tuesday morning in autumn we find two visitor of european fame within the wall of our humble room in baker street the one austere high nose eagle eye and dominant be none other than the illustrious lord bellinger <twice|double> premier of britain the other dark clear <cut|swerve> and elegant hardly <yet|still> of middle age and endow with every beauty of <body|consistence> and of mind be the right honourable trelawney hope secretary for european affair and the <most|almost> rise statesman in the <country|nation> they sit side by side upon our paper litter settee and it be easy to see from their wear and anxious face that it be business of the <most|nearly> press importance which have bring them the premier's thin blue vein hand be clasp tightly over the ivory head of his umbrella and his gaunt ascetic face look gloomily from holmes to me the european secretary pull nervously at his moustache and fidget with the seal of his watch chain when i discover my loss mr holmes which be at eight o'clock this morning i at once inform the prime minister it be at his <suggestion|proffer> that we have both come to you have you inform the police no sir say the prime minister with the quick decisive manner for which he be famous we have not do so nor be it possible that we should do <so|then> to inform the police must in the <long|tenacious> run mean to inform the public this be what we <particularly|specially> desire to avoid and why sir because the document in question be of such immense importance that it publication might very easily i might almost say probably lead to european complication of the utmost moment it be not <too|excessively> much to say that peace or war may hang upon the issue unless it <recovery|convalescence> can be attend with the utmost secrecy then it may a well not be recover at all for all that be aim at by those who have <take|assume> it be that it content should be generally know i <understand|see> now mr trelawney hope i should be much oblige if you would <tell|say> me exactly the circumstance under which this document disappear that can be <do|come> in a very few <word|news> mr holmes the letter for it <be|follow> a letter from a foreign potentate be receive six day ago it be of such importance that i have never <leave|give> it in my safe but i have take it across each even to my <house|home> in whitehall terrace and keep it in my bedroom in a <lock|engage> despatch box it be there last night of that i be certain i actually open the box while i be dress for dinner and <saw|consider> the document inside this morning it be go the despatch box have stand beside the <glass|crank> upon my dress table all night i be a light sleeper and so be my wife we be both prepare to swear that no one could <have|make> enter the <room|way> during the night and <yet|however> i repeat that the paper be go what time do you dine half past seven how long be it before you go to bed my wife have go to the theatre i wait up for her it be half past eleven before we <go|get> to our room then for four hour the despatch box have lie unguarded no one be ever permit to enter that room save the housemaid in the morning and my valet or my wife's maid during the rest of the day they be both trusty servant who have be with u for some time besides neither of them could possibly have <know|love> that there be anything more valuable than the ordinary departmental paper in my <despatch|dispatch> <box|package> who do know of the existence of that letter no one in the house surely your wife know no sir i have say nothing to my wife until i miss the paper this morning the premier nod approvingly i have long know sir how high be your sense of public duty say he i <be|follow> convince that in the case of a secret of this importance it would rise superior to the most intimate domestic tie the european secretary bow you do me no more than <justice|judge> sir until this morning i have never breathe one <word|news> to my wife upon this matter could she have guess no mr holmes she could not have <guess|gauge> nor could anyone have guess <have|take> you lose any document before no sir who be there in england who <do|make> know of the <existence|world> of this letter each member of the cabinet be inform of it yesterday but the pledge of secrecy which attend every cabinet meet be increase by the <solemn|earnest> warn which <be|follow> give by the prime minister good heaven to think that within a few hour i should myself have lose it his handsome face be <distort|wring> with a spasm of despair and his hand tear at his hair for a moment we catch a glimpse of the natural <man|gentleman> <impulsive|whimsical> ardent keenly sensitive the next the aristocratic mask be replace and the gentle <voice|part> have return besides the member of the cabinet there be two or possibly three departmental official who know of the letter no one else in england mr holmes i assure you but abroad i believe that no one abroad have <see|reckon> it save the man who <write|save> it i be <well|intimately> convince that his minister that the usual official channel have not be employ holmes consider for some little time now sir i must ask you more particularly what this document be and why it disappearance should have such momentous consequence the two statesman exchange a quick glance and the premier's shaggy eyebrow gather in a frown mr holmes the envelope be a long thin one of pale blue colour there be a <seal|stamp> of red wax stamp with a crouch lion it be address in large bold handwrite to i fear sir say holmes that interest and indeed essential a these detail be my inquiry must go more to the <root|source> of thing what be the letter that be a state <secret|underground> of the utmost importance and i fear that i cannot tell you nor do i see that it <be|follow> necessary if by the aid of the power which you be say to posse you can find such an envelope a <i|single> <describe|key> with it enclosure you will <have|get> deserve <well|easily> of your country and earn any reward which it lie in our <power|office> to <bestow|add> sherlock holmes <rise|develop> with a smile you be two of the most busy <men|piece> in the country say he and in my own small way i have also a <good|respectable> many call upon me i regret exceedingly that i cannot help you in this matter and any continuation of this interview would be a waste of time the premier spring to his <foot|pick> with that quick fierce gleam of his <deep|rich> set eye before which a cabinet have cower i be not accustom sir he <begin|get> but master his anger and resume his <seat|butt> for a minute or more we all sit in silence then the old statesman shrug his shoulder we must accept your term mr holmes no doubt you <be|follow> right and it be unreasonable for u to expect you to act unless we give you our <entire|full> confidence i agree with you sir say the younger statesman then i will tell you rely entirely upon your honour and that of your colleague dr watson i may appeal to your patriotism also for i could not imagine a greater misfortune for the country than that this affair should come out you may safely trust u the letter then be from a certain foreign potentate who have be ruffle by some recent colonial development of this country it have be <write|pen> hurriedly and upon his own responsibility entirely inquiry have show that his minister know nothing of the matter at the same time it be couch in so unfortunate a manner and certain phrase in it be of so provocative a <character|quality> that it publication would undoubtedly lead to a most <dangerous|grievous> state of feel in this <country|state> there would be such a ferment sir that i do not hesitate to say that within a week of the publication of that letter this country would be involve in a great war holmes write a <name|call> upon a slip of <paper|composition> and <hand|deal> it to the premier exactly it be he and it be this letter this letter which may well mean the <expenditure|spending> of a thousand million and the live of a hundred thousand <men|gentleman> which <have|take> become lose in this unaccountable fashion <have|get> you inform the sender yes sir a cipher telegram have be despatch perhaps he desire the publication of the letter no sir we have strong reason to believe that he already understand that he have act in an indiscreet and hot <head|manoeuvre> manner it would be a greater blow to him and to his country than to u if this letter be to come out if this be so whose interest be it that the letter should come out why should anyone desire to steal it or to publish it there mr holmes you take me into region of high international politics but if you consider the european <situation|site> you will have no difficulty in perceive the motive the whole of europe be an arm camp there be a double league which make a fair balance of military power great britain <hold|keep> the <scale|shell> if britain be drive into war with one confederacy it would assure the supremacy of the other confederacy whether they join in the war or not do you follow very clearly it be then the interest of the enemy of this potentate to secure and publish this letter so a to make a <breach|rift> between his <country|land> and ours yes sir and to whom would this document be send if it fell into the hand of an enemy to any of the great chancellery of europe it be probably <speed|race> on it way thither at the present instant a fast a steam can <take|acquire> it mr trelawney hope drop his head on his chest and groan aloud the premier place his hand kindly upon his shoulder it be your misfortune my dear fellow no one can blame you there be no precaution which you have neglect <now|instantly> mr holmes you be in full possession of the fact what course do you recommend holmes shake his head mournfully you think sir that unless this document be recover there will be war i think it be very probable then sir prepare for war that <be|follow> a hard say mr holmes consider the fact sir it be inconceivable that it be take after eleven thirty at <night|dark> since i understand that mr hope and his wife be both in the room from that hour until the loss be find out it be take <then|so> yesterday even between seven thirty and eleven thirty probably near the earlier hour since whoever take it evidently know that it be there and would naturally secure it a early a possible <now|instantly> sir if a document of this importance be take at that hour where can it <be|follow> now no one have any reason to retain it it have be pas rapidly on to those who need it what chance <have|give> we now to overtake or <even|yet> to <trace|follow> it it be beyond our reach the prime minister rise from the settee what you say be perfectly logical mr holmes i feel that the matter be indeed out of our hand <let|have> u presume for argument's sake that the document be take by the maid or by the valet they be both old and try servant i <understand|realize> you to say that your room be on the second floor that there be no entrance from without and that from within no one could go up unobserved it must then be somebody in the house who <have|give> take it to whom would the thief take it to one of several international spy and secret agent whose name be tolerably familiar to me there be three who may be say to be the head of their profession i will begin my <research|inquiry> by go round and find if each of them be at his post if one be <miss|lose> especially if he have disappear since last night we will have some indication a to where the document have <go|get> why should he <be|follow> miss ask the european secretary he would take the letter to an embassy in london a <likely|probably> a not i fancy not these agent <work|process> independently and their relation with the embassy be <often|frequently> strain
