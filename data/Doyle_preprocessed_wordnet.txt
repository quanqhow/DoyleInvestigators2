i be incline to think say i
i should do so sherlock holmes remark impatiently
i believe that i be one of the most long suffer of mortals but i'll admit that i be annoy at the sardonic interruption
really holmes say i severely you be a little try at time
he be too much absorb with his own thoughts to give any immediate answer to my remonstrance
he lean upon his hand with his untasted breakfast before him and he star at the slip of paper which he have just draw from its envelope
then he take the envelope itself hold it up to the light and very carefully study both the exterior and the flap
it be porlock's write say he thoughtfully
i can hardly doubt that it be porlock's write though i have see it only twice before
the greek e with the peculiar top flourish be distinctive
but if it be porlock then it must be something of the very first importance
he be speak to himself rather than to me but my vexation disappear in the interest which the word awaken
who then be porlock
i ask
porlock watson be a nom de plume a mere identification mark but behind it lie a shifty and evasive personality
in a former letter he frankly inform me that the name be not his own and defy me ever to trace him among the teem millions of this great city
porlock be important not for himself but for the great man with whom he be in touch
picture to yourself the pilot fish with the shark the jackal with the lion anything that be insignificant in companionship with what be formidable not only formidable watson but sinister in the highest degree sinister
that be where he come within my purview
you have hear me speak of professor moriarty
the famous scientific criminal as famous among crook as my blush watson
holmes murmur in a deprecate voice
i be about to say as he be unknown to the public
a touch
a distinct touch
cry holmes
you be develop a certain unexpected vein of pawky humour watson against which i must learn to guard myself
but in call moriarty a criminal you be utter libel in the eye of the law and there lie the glory and the wonder of it
the greatest schemer of all time the organizer of every deviltry the control brain of the underworld a brain which might have make or mar the destiny of nations that's the man
but so aloof be he from general suspicion so immune from criticism so admirable in his management and self effacement that for those very word that you have utter he could hale you to a court and emerge with your year's pension as a solatium for his wound character
be he not the celebrate author of the dynamics of an asteroid a book which ascend to such rarefy heights of pure mathematics that it be say that there be no man in the scientific press capable of criticize it
be this a man to traduce
foul mouth doctor and slander professor such would be your respective roles
that's genius watson
but if i be spar by lesser men our day will surely come
may i be there to see
i exclaim devoutly
but you be speak of this man porlock
ah yes the so call porlock be a link in the chain some little way from its great attachment
porlock be not quite a sound link between ourselves
he be the only flaw in that chain so far as i have be able to test it
but no chain be stronger than its weakest link
exactly my dear watson
hence the extreme importance of porlock
lead on by some rudimentary aspirations towards right and encourage by the judicious stimulation of an occasional ten pound note send to him by devious methods he have once or twice give me advance information which have be of value that highest value which anticipate and prevent rather than avenge crime
i cannot doubt that if we have the cipher we should find that this communication be of the nature that i indicate
again holmes flatten out the paper upon his unused plate
i rise and lean over him star down at the curious inscription which run as follow c2 douglas birlstone birlstone what do you make of it holmes
it be obviously an attempt to convey secret information
but what be the use of a cipher message without the cipher
in this instance none at all
why do you say 'in this instance'
because there be many cipher which i would read as easily as i do the apocrypha of the agony column such crude devices amuse the intelligence without fatigue it
but this be different
it be clearly a reference to the word in a page of some book
until i be tell which page and which book i be powerless
but why 'douglas' and 'birlstone'
clearly because those be word which be not contain in the page in question
then why have he not indicate the book
your native shrewdness my dear watson that innate cunning which be the delight of your friends would surely prevent you from inclose cipher and message in the same envelope
should it miscarry you be undo
as it be both have to go wrong before any harm come from it
our second post be now overdue and i shall be surprise if it do not bring us either a further letter of explanation or as be more probable the very volume to which these figure refer
holmes's calculation be fulfil within a very few minutes by the appearance of billy the page with the very letter which we be expect
the same write remark holmes as he open the envelope and actually sign he add in an exultant voice as he unfold the epistle
come we be get on watson
his brow cloud however as he glance over the content
dear me this be very disappoint
i fear watson that all our expectations come to nothing
i trust that the man porlock will come to no harm
dear mr
holmes he say i will go no further in this matter
it be too dangerous he suspect me
i can see that he suspect me
he come to me quite unexpectedly after i have actually address this envelope with the intention of send you the key to the cipher
i be able to cover it up
if he have see it it would have go hard with me
but i read suspicion in his eye
please burn the cipher message which can now be of no use to you
fred porlock
holmes sit for some little time twist this letter between his finger and frown as he star into the fire
after all he say at last there may be nothing in it
it may be only his guilty conscience
know himself to be a traitor he may have read the accusation in the other's eye
the other be i presume professor moriarty
no less
when any of that party talk about 'he' you know whom they mean
there be one predominant 'he' for all of them
but what can he do
hum
that's a large question
when you have one of the first brain of europe up against you and all the power of darkness at his back there be infinite possibilities
anyhow friend porlock be evidently scar out of his sense kindly compare the write in the note to that upon its envelope which be do he tell us before this ill omen visit
the one be clear and firm
the other hardly legible
why do he write at all
why do he not simply drop it
because he fear i would make some inquiry after him in that case and possibly bring trouble on him
no doubt say i
of course
i have pick up the original cipher message and be bend my brows over it
it's pretty madden to think that an important secret may lie here on this slip of paper and that it be beyond human power to penetrate it
sherlock holmes have push away his untasted breakfast and light the unsavoury pipe which be the companion of his deepest meditations
i wonder
say he lean back and star at the ceiling
perhaps there be point which have escape your machiavellian intellect
let us consider the problem in the light of pure reason
this man's reference be to a book
that be our point of departure
a somewhat vague one
let us see then if we can narrow it down
as i focus my mind upon it it seem rather less impenetrable
what indications have we as to this book
none
well well it be surely not quite so bad as that
the cipher message begin with a large do it not
we may take it as a work hypothesis that be the particular page to which the cipher refer
so our book have already become a large book which be surely something gain
what other indications have we as to the nature of this large book
the next sign be c2
what do you make of that watson
chapter the second no doubt
hardly that watson
you will i be sure agree with me that if the page be give the number of the chapter be immaterial
also that if page find us only in the second chapter the length of the first one must have be really intolerable
column
i cry
brilliant watson
you be scintillate this morning
if it be not column then i be very much deceive
so now you see we begin to visualize a large book print in double columns which be each of a considerable length since one of the word be number in the document as the two hundred and ninety third
have we reach the limit of what reason can supply
i fear that we have
surely you do yourself an injustice
one more coruscation my dear watson yet another brain wave
have the volume be an unusual one he would have send it to me
instead of that he have intend before his plan be nip to send me the clue in this envelope
he say so in his note
this would seem to indicate that the book be one which he think i would have no difficulty in find for myself
he have it and he imagine that i would have it too
in short watson it be a very common book
what you say certainly sound plausible
so we have contract our field of search to a large book print in double columns and in common use
the bible
i cry triumphantly
good watson good
but not if i may say so quite good enough
even if i accept the compliment for myself i could hardly name any volume which would be less likely to lie at the elbow of one of moriarty's associate
besides the editions of holy writ be so numerous that he could hardly suppose that two copy would have the same pagination
this be clearly a book which be standardize
he know for certain that his page will exactly agree with my page
but very few book would correspond with that
exactly
therein lie our salvation
our search be narrow down to standardize book which anyone may be suppose to possess
bradshaw
there be difficulties watson
the vocabulary of bradshaw be nervous and terse but limit
the selection of word would hardly lend itself to the send of general message
we will eliminate bradshaw
the dictionary be i fear inadmissible for the same reason
what then be leave
an almanac
excellent watson
i be very much mistake if you have not touch the spot
an almanac
let us consider the claim of whitaker's almanac
it be in common use
it have the requisite number of page
it be in double column
though reserve in its earlier vocabulary it become if i remember right quite garrulous towards the end
he pick the volume from his desk
here be page column two a substantial block of print deal i perceive with the trade and resources of british india
jot down the word watson
number thirteen be 'mahratta '
not i fear a very auspicious begin
number one hundred and twenty seven be 'government' which at least make sense though somewhat irrelevant to ourselves and professor moriarty
now let us try again
what do the mahratta government do
alas
the next word be 'pig's bristle '
we be undo my good watson
it be finish
he have speak in jest vein but the twitch of his bushy eyebrows bespeak his disappointment and irritation
i sit helpless and unhappy star into the fire
a long silence be break by a sudden exclamation from holmes who dash at a cupboard from which he emerge with a second yellow cover volume in his hand
we pay the price watson for be too up to date
he cry
we be before our time and suffer the usual penalties
be the seventh of january we have very properly lay in the new almanac
it be more than likely that porlock take his message from the old one
no doubt he would have tell us so have his letter of explanation be write
now let us see what page have in store for us
number thirteen be 'there ' which be much more promise
number one hundred and twenty seven be 'is' 'there is' holmes's eye be gleam with excitement and his thin nervous finger twitch as he count the word 'danger '
ha
ha
capital
put that down watson
'there be danger may come very soon one '
then we have the name 'douglas' 'rich country now at birlstone house birlstone confidence be press '
there watson
what do you think of pure reason and its fruit
if the greengrocer have such a thing as a laurel wreath i should send billy round for it
i be star at the strange message which i have scrawl as he decipher it upon a sheet of foolscap on my knee
what a queer scramble way of express his mean
say i
on the contrary he have do quite remarkably well say holmes
when you search a single column for word with which to express your mean you can hardly expect to get everything you want
you be bind to leave something to the intelligence of your correspondent
the purport be perfectly clear
some deviltry be intend against one douglas whoever he may be reside as state a rich country gentleman
he be sure 'confidence' be as near as he could get to 'confident' that it be press
there be our result and a very workmanlike little bite of analysis it be
holmes have the impersonal joy of the true artist in his better work even as he mourn darkly when it fell below the high level to which he aspire
he be still chuckle over his success when billy swing open the door and inspector macdonald of scotland yard be usher into the room
those be the early days at the end of the ' 's when alec macdonald be far from have attain the national fame which he have now achieve
he be a young but trust member of the detective force who have distinguish himself in several case which have be entrust to him
his tall bony figure give promise of exceptional physical strength while his great cranium and deep set lustrous eye speak no less clearly of the keen intelligence which twinkle out from behind his bushy eyebrows
he be a silent precise man with a dour nature and a hard aberdonian accent
twice already in his career have holmes help him to attain success his own sole reward be the intellectual joy of the problem
for this reason the affection and respect of the scotchman for his amateur colleague be profound and he show them by the frankness with which he consult holmes in every difficulty
mediocrity know nothing higher than itself but talent instantly recognize genius and macdonald have talent enough for his profession to enable him to perceive that there be no humiliation in seek the assistance of one who already stand alone in europe both in his gift and in his experience
holmes be not prone to friendship but he be tolerant of the big scotchman and smile at the sight of him
you be an early bird mr
mac say he
i wish you luck with your worm
i fear this mean that there be some mischief afoot
if you say 'hope' instead of 'fear ' it would be nearer the truth i'm think mr
holmes the inspector answer with a know grin
well maybe a wee nip would keep out the raw morning chill
no i won't smoke i thank you
i'll have to be push on my way for the early hours of a case be the precious ones as no man know better than your own self
but but the inspector have stop suddenly and be star with a look of absolute amazement at a paper upon the table
it be the sheet upon which i have scrawl the enigmatic message
douglas
he stammer
birlstone
what's this mr
holmes
man it's witchcraft
where in the name of all that be wonderful do you get those name
it be a cipher that dr
watson and i have have occasion to solve
but why what's amiss with the name
the inspector look from one to the other of us in daze astonishment
just this say he that mr
douglas of birlstone manor house be horribly murder last night
it be one of those dramatic moments for which my friend exist
it would be an overstatement to say that he be shock or even excite by the amaze announcement
without have a tinge of cruelty in his singular composition he be undoubtedly callous from long over stimulation
yet if his emotions be dull his intellectual perceptions be exceedingly active
there be no trace then of the horror which i have myself felt at this curt declaration but his face show rather the quiet and interest composure of the chemist who see the crystals fall into position from his oversaturated solution
remarkable
say he
remarkable
you don't seem surprise
interest mr
mac but hardly surprise
why should i be surprise
i receive an anonymous communication from a quarter which i know to be important warn me that danger threaten a certain person
within an hour i learn that this danger have actually materialize and that the person be dead
i be interest but as you observe i be not surprise
in a few short sentence he explain to the inspector the facts about the letter and the cipher
macdonald sit with his chin on his hand and his great sandy eyebrows bunch into a yellow tangle
i be go down to birlstone this morning say he
i have come to ask you if you care to come with me you and your friend here
but from what you say we might perhaps be do better work in london
i rather think not say holmes
hang it all mr
holmes
cry the inspector
the paper will be full of the birlstone mystery in a day or two but where's the mystery if there be a man in london who prophesy the crime before ever it occur
we have only to lay our hand on that man and the rest will follow
no doubt mr
mac
but how do you propose to lay your hand on the so call porlock
macdonald turn over the letter which holmes have hand him
post in camberwell that doesn't help us much
name you say be assume
not much to go on certainly
didn't you say that you have send him money
twice
and how
in note to camberwell post office
do you ever trouble to see who call for them
no
the inspector look surprise and a little shock
why not
because i always keep faith
i have promise when he first write that i would not try to trace him
you think there be someone behind him
i know there be
this professor that i've hear you mention
exactly
inspector macdonald smile and his eyelid quiver as he glance towards me
i won't conceal from you mr
holmes that we think in the c i d that you have a wee bite of a bee in your bonnet over this professor
i make some inquiries myself about the matter
he seem to be a very respectable learn and talented sort of man
i'm glad you've get so far as to recognize the talent
man you can't but recognize it
after i hear your view i make it my business to see him
i have a chat with him on eclipse
how the talk get that way i canna think but he have out a reflector lantern and a globe and make it all clear in a minute
he lend me a book but i don't mind say that it be a bite above my head though i have a good aberdeen upbringing
he'd have make a grand meenister with his thin face and gray hair and solemn like way of talk
when he put his hand on my shoulder as we be part it be like a father's bless before you go out into the cold cruel world
holmes chuckle and rub his hand
great
he say
great
tell me friend macdonald this please and touch interview be i suppose in the professor's study
that's so
a fine room be it not
very fine very handsome indeed mr
holmes
you sit in front of his write desk
just so
sun in your eye and his face in the shadow
well it be even but i mind that the lamp be turn on my face
it would be
do you happen to observe a picture over the professor's head
i don't miss much mr
holmes
maybe i learn that from you
yes i saw the picture a young woman with her head on her hand peep at you sideways
that paint be by jean baptiste greuze
the inspector endeavour to look interest
jean baptiste greuze holmes continue join his finger tip and lean well back in his chair be a french artist who flourish between the years and
i allude of course to his work career
modern criticism have more than indorse the high opinion form of him by his contemporaries
the inspector's eye grow abstract
hadn't we better he say
we be do so holmes interrupt
all that i be say have a very direct and vital bear upon what you have call the birlstone mystery
in fact it may in a sense be call the very centre of it
macdonald smile feebly and look appealingly to me
your thoughts move a bite too quick for me mr
holmes
you leave out a link or two and i can't get over the gap
what in the whole wide world can be the connection between this dead paint man and the affair at birlstone
all knowledge come useful to the detective remark holmes
even the trivial fact that in the year a picture by greuze entitle la jeune fille a l'agneau fetch one million two hundred thousand francs more than forty thousand pound at the portalis sale may start a train of reflection in your mind
it be clear that it do
the inspector look honestly interest
i may remind you holmes continue that the professor's salary can be ascertain in several trustworthy book of reference
it be seven hundred a year
then how could he buy quite so
how could he
ay that's remarkable say the inspector thoughtfully
talk away mr
holmes
i'm just love it
it's fine
holmes smile
he be always warm by genuine admiration the characteristic of the real artist
what about birlstone
he ask
we've time yet say the inspector glance at his watch
i've a cab at the door and it won't take us twenty minutes to victoria
but about this picture i think you tell me once mr
holmes that you have never meet professor moriarty
no i never have
then how do you know about his room
ah that's another matter
i have be three time in his room twice wait for him under different pretexts and leave before he come
once well i can hardly tell about the once to an official detective
it be on the last occasion that i take the liberty of run over his paper with the most unexpected result
you find something compromise
absolutely nothing
that be what amaze me
however you have now see the point of the picture
it show him to be a very wealthy man
how do he acquire wealth
he be unmarried
his younger brother be a station master in the west of england
his chair be worth seven hundred a year
and he own a greuze
well
surely the inference be plain
you mean that he have a great income and that he must earn it in an illegal fashion
exactly
of course i have other reason for think so dozens of exiguous thread which lead vaguely up towards the centre of the web where the poisonous motionless creature be lurk
i only mention the greuze because it bring the matter within the range of your own observation
well mr
holmes i admit that what you say be interest it's more than interest it's just wonderful
but let us have it a little clearer if you can
be it forgery coin burglary where do the money come from
have you ever read of jonathan wild
well the name have a familiar sound
someone in a novel be he not
i don't take much stock of detectives in novels chap that do things and never let you see how they do them
that's just inspiration not business
jonathan wild wasn't a detective and he wasn't in a novel
he be a master criminal and he live last century or thereabouts
then he's no use to me
i'm a practical man
mr
mac the most practical thing that you ever do in your life would be to shut yourself up for three months and read twelve hours a day at the annals of crime
everything come in circle even professor moriarty
jonathan wild be the hide force of the london criminals to whom he sell his brain and his organization on a fifteen per cent commission
the old wheel turn and the same speak come up
it's all be do before and will be again
i'll tell you one or two things about moriarty which may interest you
you'll interest me right enough
i happen to know who be the first link in his chain a chain with this napoleon go wrong at one end and a hundred break fight men pickpockets blackmailers and card sharpers at the other with every sort of crime in between
his chief of staff be colonel sebastian moran as aloof and guard and inaccessible to the law as himself
what do you think he pay him
i'd like to hear
six thousand a year
that's pay for brain you see the american business principle
i learn that detail quite by chance
it's more than the prime minister get
that give you an idea of moriarty's gain and of the scale on which he work
another point i make it my business to hunt down some of moriarty's check lately just common innocent check that he pay his household bill with
they be draw on six different bank
do that make any impression on your mind
queer certainly
but what do you gather from it
that he want no gossip about his wealth
no single man should know what he have
i have no doubt that he have twenty bank account the bulk of his fortune abroad in the deutsche bank or the credit lyonnais as likely as not
sometime when you have a year or two to spare i commend to you the study of professor moriarty
inspector macdonald have grow steadily more impress as the conversation proceed
he have lose himself in his interest
now his practical scotch intelligence bring him back with a snap to the matter in hand
he can keep anyhow say he
you've get us side track with your interest anecdotes mr
holmes
what really count be your remark that there be some connection between the professor and the crime
that you get from the warn receive through the man porlock
can we for our present practical need get any further than that
we may form some conception as to the motives of the crime
it be as i gather from your original remark an inexplicable or at least an unexplained murder
now presume that the source of the crime be as we suspect it to be there might be two different motives
in the first place i may tell you that moriarty rule with a rod of iron over his people
his discipline be tremendous
there be only one punishment in his code
it be death
now we might suppose that this murder man this douglas whose approach fate be know by one of the arch criminal's subordinate have in some way betray the chief
his punishment follow and would be know to all if only to put the fear of death into them
well that be one suggestion mr
holmes
the other be that it have be engineer by moriarty in the ordinary course of business
be there any robbery
i have not hear
if so it would of course be against the first hypothesis and in favour of the second
moriarty may have be engage to engineer it on a promise of part spoil or he may have be pay so much down to manage it
either be possible
but whichever it may be or if it be some third combination it be down at birlstone that we must seek the solution
i know our man too well to suppose that he have leave anything up here which may lead us to him
then to birlstone we must go
cry macdonald jump from his chair
my word
it's later than i think
i can give you gentlemen five minutes for preparation and that be all
and ample for us both say holmes as he spring up and hasten to change from his dress gown to his coat
while we be on our way mr
mac i will ask you to be good enough to tell me all about it
all about it prove to be disappointingly little and yet there be enough to assure us that the case before us might well be worthy of the expert's closest attention
he brighten and rub his thin hand together as he listen to the meagre but remarkable detail
a long series of sterile weeks lay behind us and here at last there be a fit object for those remarkable power which like all special gift become irksome to their owner when they be not in use
that razor brain blunt and rust with inaction
sherlock holmes's eye glisten his pale cheek take a warmer hue and his whole eager face shine with an inward light when the call for work reach him
lean forward in the cab he listen intently to macdonald's short sketch of the problem which await us in sussex
the inspector be himself dependent as he explain to us upon a scribble account forward to him by the milk train in the early hours of the morning
white mason the local officer be a personal friend and hence macdonald have be notify much more promptly than be usual at scotland yard when provincials need their assistance
it be a very cold scent upon which the metropolitan expert be generally ask to run
dear inspector macdonald say the letter which he read to us official requisition for your service be in separate envelope
this be for your private eye
wire me what train in the morning you can get for birlstone and i will meet it or have it meet if i be too occupy
this case be a snorter
don't waste a moment in get start
if you can bring mr
holmes please do so for he will find something after his own heart
we would think the whole thing have be fix up for theatrical effect if there wasn't a dead man in the middle of it
my word
it be a snorter
your friend seem to be no fool remark holmes
no sir white mason be a very live man if i be any judge
well have you anything more
only that he will give us every detail when we meet
then how do you get at mr
douglas and the fact that he have be horribly murder
that be in the enclose official report
it didn't say 'horrible' that's not a recognize official term
it give the name john douglas
it mention that his injuries have be in the head from the discharge of a shotgun
it also mention the hour of the alarm which be close on to midnight last night
it add that the case be undoubtedly one of murder but that no arrest have be make and that the case be one which present some very perplex and extraordinary feature
that's absolutely all we have at present mr
holmes
then with your permission we will leave it at that mr
mac
the temptation to form premature theories upon insufficient data be the bane of our profession
i can see only two things for certain at present a great brain in london and a dead man in sussex
it's the chain between that we be go to trace
now for a moment i will ask leave to remove my own insignificant personality and to describe events which occur before we arrive upon the scene by the light of knowledge which come to us afterwards
only in this way can i make the reader appreciate the people concern and the strange set in which their fate be cast
the village of birlstone be a small and very ancient cluster of half timbered cottages on the northern border of the county of sussex
for centuries it have remain unchanged but within the last few years its picturesque appearance and situation have attract a number of well to do residents whose villas peep out from the woods around
these woods be locally suppose to be the extreme fringe of the great weald forest which thin away until it reach the northern chalk down
a number of small shop have come into be to meet the want of the increase population so there seem some prospect that birlstone may soon grow from an ancient village into a modern town
it be the centre for a considerable area of country since tunbridge well the nearest place of importance be ten or twelve miles to the eastward over the border of kent
about half a mile from the town stand in an old park famous for its huge beech tree be the ancient manor house of birlstone
part of this venerable build date back to the time of the first crusade when hugo de capus build a fortalice in the centre of the estate which have be grant to him by the red king
this be destroy by fire in and some of its smoke blacken corner stone be use when in jacobean time a brick country house rise upon the ruin of the feudal castle
the manor house with its many gables and its small diamond pan windows be still much as the builder have leave it in the early seventeenth century
of the double moats which have guard its more warlike predecessor the outer have be allow to dry up and serve the humble function of a kitchen garden
the inner one be still there and lay forty feet in breadth though now only a few feet in depth round the whole house
a small stream feed it and continue beyond it so that the sheet of water though turbid be never ditch like or unhealthy
the grind floor windows be within a foot of the surface of the water
the only approach to the house be over a drawbridge the chain and windlass of which have long be rust and break
the latest tenant of the manor house have however with characteristic energy set this right and the drawbridge be not only capable of be raise but actually be raise every even and lower every morning
by thus renew the custom of the old feudal days the manor house be convert into an island during the night a fact which have a very direct bear upon the mystery which be soon to engage the attention of all england
the house have be untenanted for some years and be threaten to moulder into a picturesque decay when the douglases take possession of it
this family consist of only two individuals john douglas and his wife
douglas be a remarkable man both in character and in person
in age he may have be about fifty with a strong jaw rugged face a grizzle moustache peculiarly keen gray eye and a wiry vigorous figure which have lose nothing of the strength and activity of youth
he be cheery and genial to all but somewhat offhand in his manners give the impression that he have see life in social strata on some far lower horizon than the county society of sussex
yet though look at with some curiosity and reserve by his more cultivate neighbour he soon acquire a great popularity among the villagers subscribe handsomely to all local object and attend their smoke concert and other function where have a remarkably rich tenor voice he be always ready to oblige with an excellent song
he appear to have plenty of money which be say to have be gain in the california gold field and it be clear from his own talk and that of his wife that he have spend a part of his life in america
the good impression which have be produce by his generosity and by his democratic manners be increase by a reputation gain for utter indifference to danger
though a wretched rider he turn out at every meet and take the most amaze fall in his determination to hold his own with the best
when the vicarage catch fire he distinguish himself also by the fearlessness with which he reentered the build to save property after the local fire brigade have give it up as impossible
thus it come about that john douglas of the manor house have within five years win himself quite a reputation in birlstone
his wife too be popular with those who have make her acquaintance though after the english fashion the callers upon a stranger who settle in the county without introductions be few and far between
this matter the less to her as she be retire by disposition and very much absorb to all appearance in her husband and her domestic duties
it be know that she be an english lady who have meet mr
douglas in london he be at that time a widower
she be a beautiful woman tall dark and slender some twenty years younger than her husband a disparity which seem in no wise to mar the contentment of their family life
it be remark sometimes however by those who know them best that the confidence between the two do not appear to be complete since the wife be either very reticent about her husband's past life or else as seem more likely be imperfectly inform about it
it have also be note and comment upon by a few observant people that there be sign sometimes of some nerve strain upon the part of mrs
douglas and that she would display acute uneasiness if her absent husband should ever be particularly late in his return
on a quiet countryside where all gossip be welcome this weakness of the lady of the manor house do not pass without remark and it bulk larger upon people's memory when the events arise which give it a very special significance
there be yet another individual whose residence under that roof be it be true only an intermittent one but whose presence at the time of the strange happen which will now be narrate bring his name prominently before the public
this be cecil jam barker of hale lodge hampstead
cecil barker's tall loose joint figure be a familiar one in the main street of birlstone village for he be a frequent and welcome visitor at the manor house
he be the more notice as be the only friend of the past unknown life of mr
douglas who be ever see in his new english surround
barker be himself an undoubted englishman but by his remark it be clear that he have first know douglas in america and have there live on intimate term with him
he appear to be a man of considerable wealth and be repute to be a bachelor
in age he be rather younger than douglas forty five at the most a tall straight broad chested fellow with a clean shave prize fighter face thick strong black eyebrows and a pair of masterful black eye which might even without the aid of his very capable hand clear a way for him through a hostile crowd
he neither ride nor shoot but spend his days in wander round the old village with his pipe in his mouth or in drive with his host or in his absence with his host over the beautiful countryside
an easy go free hand gentleman say ames the butler
but my word
i have rather not be the man that cross him
he be cordial and intimate with douglas and he be no less friendly with his wife a friendship which more than once seem to cause some irritation to the husband so that even the servants be able to perceive his annoyance
such be the third person who be one of the family when the catastrophe occur
as to the other denizens of the old build it will suffice out of a large household to mention the prim respectable and capable ames and mrs
allen a buxom and cheerful person who relieve the lady of some of her household care
the other six servants in the house bear no relation to the events of the night of january 6th
it be at eleven forty five that the first alarm reach the small local police station in charge of sergeant wilson of the sussex constabulary
cecil barker much excite have rush up to the door and peal furiously upon the bell
a terrible tragedy have occur at the manor house and john douglas have be murder
that be the breathless burden of his message
he have hurry back to the house follow within a few minutes by the police sergeant who arrive at the scene of the crime a little after twelve o'clock after take prompt step to warn the county authorities that something serious be afoot
on reach the manor house the sergeant have find the drawbridge down the windows light up and the whole household in a state of wild confusion and alarm
the white face servants be huddle together in the hall with the frighten butler wring his hand in the doorway
only cecil barker seem to be master of himself and his emotions he have open the door which be nearest to the entrance and he have beckon to the sergeant to follow him
at that moment there arrive dr
wood a brisk and capable general practitioner from the village
the three men enter the fatal room together while the horror stricken butler follow at their heel close the door behind him to shut out the terrible scene from the maid servants
the dead man lay on his back sprawl with outstretched limbs in the centre of the room
he be clothe only in a pink dress gown which cover his night clothe
there be carpet slippers on his bare feet
the doctor kneel beside him and hold down the hand lamp which have stand on the table
one glance at the victim be enough to show the healer that his presence could be dispense with
the man have be horribly injure
lie across his chest be a curious weapon a shotgun with the barrel saw off a foot in front of the trigger
it be clear that this have be fire at close range and that he have receive the whole charge in the face blow his head almost to piece
the trigger have be wire together so as to make the simultaneous discharge more destructive
the country policeman be unnerve and trouble by the tremendous responsibility which have come so suddenly upon him
we will touch nothing until my superiors arrive he say in a hush voice star in horror at the dreadful head
nothing have be touch up to now say cecil barker
i'll answer for that
you see it all exactly as i find it
when be that
the sergeant have draw out his notebook
it be just half past eleven
i have not begin to undress and i be sit by the fire in my bedroom when i hear the report
it be not very loud it seem to be muffle
i rush down i don't suppose it be thirty second before i be in the room
be the door open
yes it be open
poor douglas be lie as you see him
his bedroom candle be burn on the table
it be i who light the lamp some minutes afterward
do you see no one
no
i hear mrs
douglas come down the stair behind me and i rush out to prevent her from see this dreadful sight
mrs
allen the housekeeper come and take her away
ames have arrive and we run back into the room once more
but surely i have hear that the drawbridge be keep up all night
yes it be up until i lower it
then how could any murderer have get away
it be out of the question
mr
douglas must have shoot himself
that be our first idea
but see
barker draw aside the curtain and show that the long diamond pan window be open to its full extent
and look at this
he hold the lamp down and illuminate a smudge of blood like the mark of a boot sole upon the wooden sill
someone have stand there in get out
you mean that someone wad across the moat
exactly
then if you be in the room within half a minute of the crime he must have be in the water at that very moment
i have not a doubt of it
i wish to heaven that i have rush to the window
but the curtain screen it as you can see and so it never occur to me
then i hear the step of mrs
douglas and i could not let her enter the room
it would have be too horrible
horrible enough
say the doctor look at the shatter head and the terrible mark which surround it
i've never see such injuries since the birlstone railway smash
but i say remark the police sergeant whose slow bucolic common sense be still ponder the open window
it's all very well your say that a man escape by wad this moat but what i ask you be how do he ever get into the house at all if the bridge be up
ah that's the question say barker
at what o'clock be it raise
it be nearly six o'clock say ames the butler
i've hear say the sergeant that it be usually raise at sunset
that would be nearer half past four than six at this time of year
mrs
douglas have visitors to tea say ames
i couldn't raise it until they go
then i wind it up myself
then it come to this say the sergeant if anyone come from outside if they do they must have get in across the bridge before six and be in hide ever since until mr
douglas come into the room after eleven
that be so
mr
douglas go round the house every night the last thing before he turn in to see that the light be right
that bring him in here
the man be wait and shoot him
then he get away through the window and leave his gun behind him
that's how i read it for nothing else will fit the facts
the sergeant pick up a card which lay beside the dead man on the floor
the initial v v and under them the number be rudely scrawl in ink upon it
what's this
he ask hold it up
barker look at it with curiosity
i never notice it before he say
the murderer must have leave it behind him
v
v
i can make no sense of that
the sergeant keep turn it over in his big finger
what's v v
somebody's initial maybe
what have you get there dr
wood
it be a good size hammer which have be lie on the rug in front of the fireplace a substantial workmanlike hammer
cecil barker point to a box of brass head nail upon the mantelpiece
mr
douglas be alter the picture yesterday he say
i saw him myself stand upon that chair and fix the big picture above it
that account for the hammer
we'd best put it back on the rug where we find it say the sergeant scratch his puzzle head in his perplexity
it will want the best brain in the force to get to the bottom of this thing
it will be a london job before it be finish
he raise the hand lamp and walk slowly round the room
hullo
he cry excitedly draw the window curtain to one side
what o'clock be those curtain draw
when the lamps be light say the butler
it would be shortly after four
someone have be hide here sure enough
he hold down the light and the mark of muddy boot be very visible in the corner
i'm bind to say this bear out your theory mr
barker
it look as if the man get into the house after four when the curtain be draw and before six when the bridge be raise
he slip into this room because it be the first that he saw
there be no other place where he could hide so he pop in behind this curtain
that all seem clear enough
it be likely that his main idea be to burgle the house but mr
douglas chance to come upon him so he murder him and escape
that's how i read it say barker
but i say aren't we waste precious time
couldn't we start out and scour the country before the fellow get away
the sergeant consider for a moment
there be no train before six in the morning so he can't get away by rail
if he go by road with his legs all drip it's odds that someone will notice him
anyhow i can't leave here myself until i be relieve
but i think none of you should go until we see more clearly how we all stand
the doctor have take the lamp and be narrowly scrutinize the body
what's this mark
he ask
could this have any connection with the crime
the dead man's right arm be thrust out from his dress gown and expose as high as the elbow
about halfway up the forearm be a curious brown design a triangle inside a circle stand out in vivid relief upon the lard colour skin
it's not tattoo say the doctor peer through his glass
i never saw anything like it
the man have be brand at some time as they brand cattle
what be the mean of this
i don't profess to know the mean of it say cecil barker but i have see the mark on douglas many time this last ten years
and so have i say the butler
many a time when the master have roll up his sleeves i have notice that very mark
i've often wonder what it could be
then it have nothing to do with the crime anyhow say the sergeant
but it's a rum thing all the same
everything about this case be rum
well what be it now
the butler have give an exclamation of astonishment and be point at the dead man's outstretched hand
they've take his wed ring
he gasp
what
yes indeed
master always wear his plain gold wed ring on the little finger of his leave hand
that ring with the rough nugget on it be above it and the twist snake ring on the third finger
there's the nugget and there's the snake but the wed ring be go
he's right say barker
do you tell me say the sergeant that the wed ring be below the other
always
then the murderer or whoever it be first take off this ring you call the nugget ring then the wed ring and afterwards put the nugget ring back again
that be so
the worthy country policeman shake his head
seem to me the sooner we get london on to this case the better say he
white mason be a smart man
no local job have ever be too much for white mason
it won't be long now before he be here to help us
but i expect we'll have to look to london before we be through
anyhow i'm not ashamed to say that it be a deal too thick for the like of me
at three in the morning the chief sussex detective obey the urgent call from sergeant wilson of birlstone arrive from headquarter in a light dog cart behind a breathless trotter
by the five forty train in the morning he have send his message to scotland yard and he be at the birlstone station at twelve o'clock to welcome us
white mason be a quiet comfortable look person in a loose tweed suit with a clean shave ruddy face a stoutish body and powerful bandy legs adorn with gaiters look like a small farmer a retire gamekeeper or anything upon earth except a very favourable specimen of the provincial criminal officer
a real downright snorter mr
macdonald
he keep repeat
we'll have the pressmen down like fly when they understand it
i'm hop we will get our work do before they get poke their nose into it and mess up all the trail
there have be nothing like this that i can remember
there be some bits that will come home to you mr
holmes or i be mistake
and you also dr
watson for the medicos will have a word to say before we finish
your room be at the westville arm
there's no other place but i hear that it be clean and good
the man will carry your bag
this way gentlemen if you please
he be a very bustle and genial person this sussex detective
in ten minutes we have all find our quarter
in ten more we be seat in the parlour of the inn and be treat to a rapid sketch of those events which have be outline in the previous chapter
macdonald make an occasional note while holmes sit absorb with the expression of surprise and reverent admiration with which the botanist survey the rare and precious bloom
remarkable
he say when the story be unfold most remarkable
i can hardly recall any case where the feature have be more peculiar
i think you would say so mr
holmes say white mason in great delight
we're well up with the time in sussex
i've tell you now how matter be up to the time when i take over from sergeant wilson between three and four this morning
my word
i make the old mare go
but i need not have be in such a hurry as it turn out for there be nothing immediate that i could do
sergeant wilson have all the facts
i check them and consider them and maybe add a few of my own
what be they
ask holmes eagerly
well i first have the hammer examine
there be dr
wood there to help me
we find no sign of violence upon it
i be hop that if mr
douglas defend himself with the hammer he might have leave his mark upon the murderer before he drop it on the mat
but there be no stain
that of course prove nothing at all remark inspector macdonald
there have be many a hammer murder and no trace on the hammer
quite so
it doesn't prove it wasn't use
but there might have be stain and that would have help us
as a matter of fact there be none
then i examine the gun
they be buckshot cartridges and as sergeant wilson point out the trigger be wire together so that if you pull on the hinder one both barrel be discharge
whoever fix that up have make up his mind that he be go to take no chance of miss his man
the saw gun be not more than two foot long one could carry it easily under one's coat
there be no complete maker's name but the print letter p e n be on the flute between the barrel and the rest of the name have be cut off by the saw
a big p with a flourish above it e and n smaller
ask holmes
exactly
pennsylvania small arm company well know american firm say holmes
white mason gaze at my friend as the little village practitioner look at the harley street specialist who by a word can solve the difficulties that perplex him
that be very helpful mr
holmes
no doubt you be right
wonderful
wonderful
do you carry the name of all the gun makers in the world in your memory
holmes dismiss the subject with a wave
no doubt it be an american shotgun white mason continue
i seem to have read that a saw off shotgun be a weapon use in some part of america
apart from the name upon the barrel the idea have occur to me
there be some evidence then that this man who enter the house and kill its master be an american
macdonald shake his head
man you be surely travel overfast say he
i have hear no evidence yet that any stranger be ever in the house at all
the open window the blood on the sill the queer card the mark of boot in the corner the gun
nothing there that could not have be arrange
mr
douglas be an american or have live long in america
so have mr
barker
you don't need to import an american from outside in order to account for american do
ames the butler what about him
be he reliable
ten years with sir charles chandos as solid as a rock
he have be with douglas ever since he take the manor house five years ago
he have never see a gun of this sort in the house
the gun be make to conceal
that's why the barrel be saw
it would fit into any box
how could he swear there be no such gun in the house
well anyhow he have never see one
macdonald shake his obstinate scotch head
i'm not convince yet that there be ever anyone in the house say he
i'm ask you to conseedar his accent become more aberdonian as he lose himself in his argument i'm ask you to conseedar what it involve if you suppose that this gun be ever bring into the house and that all these strange things be do by a person from outside
oh man it's just inconceivable
it's clean against common sense
i put it to you mr
holmes judge it by what we have hear
well state your case mr
mac say holmes in his most judicial style
the man be not a burglar suppose that he ever exist
the ring business and the card point to premeditate murder for some private reason
very good
here be a man who slip into a house with the deliberate intention of commit murder
he know if he know anything that he will have a deeficulty in make his escape as the house be surround with water
what weapon would he choose
you would say the most silent in the world
then he could hope when the deed be do to slip quickly from the window to wade the moat and to get away at his leisure
that's understandable
but be it understandable that he should go out of his way to bring with him the most noisy weapon he could select know well that it will fetch every human be in the house to the spot as quick as they can run and that it be all odds that he will be see before he can get across the moat
be that credible mr
holmes
well you put the case strongly my friend reply thoughtfully
it certainly need a good deal of justification
may i ask mr
white mason whether you examine the farther side of the moat at once to see if there be any sign of the man have climb out from the water
there be no sign mr
holmes
but it be a stone ledge and one could hardly expect them
no track or mark
none
ha
would there be any objection mr
white mason to our go down to the house at once
there may possibly be some small point which might be suggestive
i be go to propose it mr
holmes but i think it well to put you in touch with all the facts before we go
i suppose if anything should strike you white mason look doubtfully at the amateur
i have work with mr
holmes before say inspector macdonald
he play the game
my own idea of the game at any rate say holmes with a smile
i go into a case to help the end of justice and the work of the police
if i have ever separate myself from the official force it be because they have first separate themselves from me
i have no wish ever to score at their expense
at the same time mr
white mason i claim the right to work in my own way and give my result at my own time complete rather than in stag
i be sure we be honour by your presence and to show you all we know say white mason cordially
come along dr
watson and when the time come we'll all hope for a place in your book
we walk down the quaint village street with a row of pollard elms on each side of it
just beyond be two ancient stone pillars weather stain and lichen blotch bear upon their summit a shapeless something which have once be the rampant lion of capus of birlstone
a short walk along the wind drive with such sward and oaks around it as one only see in rural england then a sudden turn and the long low jacobean house of dingy liver colour brick lay before us with an old fashion garden of cut yews on each side of it
as we approach it there be the wooden drawbridge and the beautiful broad moat as still and luminous as quicksilver in the cold winter sunshine
three centuries have flow past the old manor house centuries of birth and of homecomings of country dance and of the meet of fox hunters
strange that now in its old age this dark business should have cast its shadow upon the venerable wall
and yet those strange peak roof and quaint overhang gables be a fit cover to grim and terrible intrigue
as i look at the deep set windows and the long sweep of the dull colour water lap front i felt that no more fit scene could be set for such a tragedy
that's the window say white mason that one on the immediate right of the drawbridge
it's open just as it be find last night
it look rather narrow for a man to pass
well it wasn't a fat man anyhow
we don't need your deductions mr
holmes to tell us that
but you or i could squeeze through all right
holmes walk to the edge of the moat and look across
then he examine the stone ledge and the grass border beyond it
i've have a good look mr
holmes say white mason
there be nothing there no sign that anyone have land but why should he leave any sign
exactly
why should he
be the water always turbid
generally about this colour
the stream bring down the clay
how deep be it
about two feet at each side and three in the middle
so we can put aside all idea of the man have be drown in cross
no a child could not be drown in it
we walk across the drawbridge and be admit by a quaint gnarl dry up person who be the butler ames
the poor old fellow be white and quiver from the shock
the village sergeant a tall formal melancholy man still hold his vigil in the room of fate
the doctor have depart
anything fresh sergeant wilson
ask white mason
no sir
then you can go home
you've have enough
we can send for you if we want you
the butler have better wait outside
tell him to warn mr
cecil barker mrs
douglas and the housekeeper that we may want a word with them presently
now gentlemen perhaps you will allow me to give you the view i have form first and then you will be able to arrive at your own
he impress me this country specialist
he have a solid grip of fact and a cool clear common sense brain which should take him some way in his profession
holmes listen to him intently with no sign of that impatience which the official exponent too often produce
be it suicide or be it murder that's our first question gentlemen be it not
if it be suicide then we have to believe that this man begin by take off his wed ring and conceal it that he then come down here in his dress gown trample mud into a corner behind the curtain in order to give the idea someone have wait for him open the window put blood on the we can surely dismiss that say macdonald
so i think
suicide be out of the question
then a murder have be do
what we have to determine be whether it be do by someone outside or inside the house
well let's hear the argument
there be considerable difficulties both ways and yet one or the other it must be
we will suppose first that some person or persons inside the house do the crime
they get this man down here at a time when everything be still and yet no one be asleep
they then do the deed with the queerest and noisiest weapon in the world so as to tell everyone what have happen a weapon that be never see in the house before
that do not seem a very likely start do it
no it do not
well then everyone be agree that after the alarm be give only a minute at the most have pass before the whole household not mr
cecil barker alone though he claim to have be the first but ames and all of them be on the spot
do you tell me that in that time the guilty person manage to make footmarks in the corner open the window mark the sill with blood take the wed ring off the dead man's finger and all the rest of it
it's impossible
you put it very clearly say holmes
i be incline to agree with you
well then we be drive back to the theory that it be do by someone from outside
we be still face with some big difficulties but anyhow they have cease to be impossibilities
the man get into the house between four thirty and six that be to say between dusk and the time when the bridge be raise
there have be some visitors and the door be open so there be nothing to prevent him
he may have be a common burglar or he may have have some private grudge against mr
douglas
since mr
douglas have spend most of his life in america and this shotgun seem to be an american weapon it would seem that the private grudge be the more likely theory
he slip into this room because it be the first he come to and he hide behind the curtain
there he remain until past eleven at night
at that time mr
douglas enter the room
it be a short interview if there be any interview at all for mrs
douglas declare that her husband have not leave her more than a few minutes when she hear the shoot
the candle show that say holmes
exactly
the candle which be a new one be not burn more than half an inch
he must have place it on the table before he be attack otherwise of course it would have fall when he fell
this show that he be not attack the instant that he enter the room
when mr
barker arrive the candle be light and the lamp be out
that's all clear enough
well now we can reconstruct things on those line
mr
douglas enter the room
he put down the candle
a man appear from behind the curtain
he be arm with this gun
he demand the wed ring heaven only know why but so it must have be
mr
douglas give it up
then either in cold blood or in the course of a struggle douglas may have grip the hammer that be find upon the mat he shoot douglas in this horrible way
he drop his gun and also it would seem this queer card v v
whatever that may mean and he make his escape through the window and across the moat at the very moment when cecil barker be discover the crime
how's that mr
holmes
very interest but just a little unconvincing
man it would be absolute nonsense if it wasn't that anything else be even worse
cry macdonald
somebody kill the man and whoever it be i could clearly prove to you that he should have do it some other way
what do he mean by allow his retreat to be cut off like that
what do he mean by use a shotgun when silence be his one chance of escape
come mr
holmes it's up to you to give us a lead since you say mr
white mason's theory be unconvincing
holmes have sit intently observant during this long discussion miss no word that be say with his keen eye dart to right and to leave and his forehead wrinkle with speculation
i should like a few more facts before i get so far as a theory mr
mac say he kneel down beside the body
dear me
these injuries be really appal
can we have the butler in for a moment



ames i understand that you have often see this very unusual mark a brand triangle inside a circle upon mr
douglas's forearm
frequently sir
you never hear any speculation as to what it mean
no sir
it must have cause great pain when it be inflict
it be undoubtedly a burn
now i observe ames that there be a small piece of plaster at the angle of mr
douglas's jaw
do you observe that in life
yes sir he cut himself in shave yesterday morning
do you ever know him to cut himself in shave before
not for a very long time sir
suggestive
say holmes
it may of course be a mere coincidence or it may point to some nervousness which would indicate that he have reason to apprehend danger
have you notice anything unusual in his conduct yesterday ames
it strike me that he be a little restless and excite sir
ha
the attack may not have be entirely unexpected
we do seem to make a little progress do we not
perhaps you would rather do the question mr
mac
no mr
holmes it's in better hand than mine
well then we will pass to this card v v

it be rough cardboard
have you any of the sort in the house
i don't think so
holmes walk across to the desk and dab a little ink from each bottle on to the blot paper
it be not print in this room he say this be black ink and the other purplish
it be do by a thick pen and these be fine
no it be do elsewhere i should say
can you make anything of the inscription ames
no sir nothing
what do you think mr
mac
it give me the impression of a secret society of some sort the same with his badge upon the forearm
that's my idea too say white mason
well we can adopt it as a work hypothesis and then see how far our difficulties disappear
an agent from such a society make his way into the house wait for mr
douglas blow his head nearly off with this weapon and escape by wad the moat after leave a card beside the dead man which will when mention in the paper tell other members of the society that vengeance have be do
that all hang together
but why this gun of all weapons
exactly
and why the miss ring
quite so
and why no arrest
it's past two now
i take it for grant that since dawn every constable within forty miles have be look out for a wet stranger
that be so mr
holmes
well unless he have a burrow close by or a change of clothe ready they can hardly miss him
and yet they have miss him up to now
holmes have go to the window and be examine with his lens the blood mark on the sill
it be clearly the tread of a shoe
it be remarkably broad a splay foot one would say
curious because so far as one can trace any footmark in this mud stain corner one would say it be a more shapely sole
however they be certainly very indistinct
what's this under the side table
mr
douglas's dumb bell say ames
dumb bell there's only one
where's the other
i don't know mr
holmes
there may have be only one
i have not notice them for months
one dumb bell holmes say seriously but his remark be interrupt by a sharp knock at the door
a tall sunburn capable look clean shave man look in at us
i have no difficulty in guess that it be the cecil barker of whom i have hear
his masterful eye travel quickly with a question glance from face to face
sorry to interrupt your consultation say he but you should hear the latest news
an arrest
no such luck
but they've find his bicycle
the fellow leave his bicycle behind him
come and have a look
it be within a hundred yards of the hall door
we find three or four groom and idlers stand in the drive inspect a bicycle which have be draw out from a clump of evergreens in which it have be conceal
it be a well use rudge whitworth splash as from a considerable journey
there be a saddlebag with spanner and oilcan but no clue as to the owner
it would be a grand help to the police say the inspector if these things be number and register
but we must be thankful for what we've get
if we can't find where he go to at least we be likely to get where he come from
but what in the name of all that be wonderful make the fellow leave it behind
and how in the world have he get away without it
we don't seem to get a gleam of light in the case mr
holmes
don't we
my friend answer thoughtfully
i wonder
have you see all you want of the study
ask white mason as we reentered the house
for the time say the inspector and holmes nod
then perhaps you would now like to hear the evidence of some of the people in the house
we could use the din room ames
please come yourself first and tell us what you know
the butler's account be a simple and a clear one and he give a convince impression of sincerity
he have be engage five years before when douglas first come to birlstone
he understand that mr
douglas be a rich gentleman who have make his money in america
he have be a kind and considerate employer not quite what ames be use to perhaps but one can't have everything
he never saw any sign of apprehension in mr
douglas on the contrary he be the most fearless man he have ever know
he order the drawbridge to be pull up every night because it be the ancient custom of the old house and he like to keep the old ways up
mr
douglas seldom go to london or leave the village but on the day before the crime he have be shop at tunbridge well
he ames have observe some restlessness and excitement on the part of mr
douglas that day for he have seem impatient and irritable which be unusual with him
he have not go to bed that night but be in the pantry at the back of the house put away the silver when he hear the bell ring violently
he hear no shoot but it be hardly possible he would as the pantry and kitchens be at the very back of the house and there be several close doors and a long passage between
the housekeeper have come out of her room attract by the violent ring of the bell
they have go to the front of the house together
as they reach the bottom of the stair he have see mrs
douglas come down it
no she be not hurry it do not seem to him that she be particularly agitate
just as she reach the bottom of the stair mr
barker have rush out of the study
he have stop mrs
douglas and beg her to go back
for god's sake go back to your room
he cry
poor jack be dead
you can do nothing
for god's sake go back
after some persuasion upon the stairs mrs
douglas have go back
she do not scream
she make no outcry whatever
mrs
allen the housekeeper have take her upstairs and stay with her in the bedroom
ames and mr
barker have then return to the study where they have find everything exactly as the police have see it
the candle be not light at that time but the lamp be burn
they have look out of the window but the night be very dark and nothing could be see or hear
they have then rush out into the hall where ames have turn the windlass which lower the drawbridge
mr
barker have then hurry off to get the police
such in its essentials be the evidence of the butler
the account of mrs
allen the housekeeper be so far as it go a corroboration of that of her fellow servant
the housekeeper's room be rather nearer to the front of the house than the pantry in which ames have be work
she be prepare to go to bed when the loud ring of the bell have attract her attention
she be a little hard of hear
perhaps that be why she have not hear the shoot but in any case the study be a long way off
she remember hear some sound which she imagine to be the slam of a door
that be a good deal earlier half an hour at least before the ring of the bell
when mr
ames run to the front she go with him
she saw mr
barker very pale and excite come out of the study
he intercept mrs
douglas who be come down the stairs
he entreat her to go back and she answer him but what she say could not be hear
take her up
stay with her
he have say to mrs
allen
she have therefore take her to the bedroom and endeavour to soothe her
she be greatly excite tremble all over but make no other attempt to go downstairs
she just sit in her dress gown by her bedroom fire with her head sink in her hand
mrs
allen stay with her most of the night
as to the other servants they have all go to bed and the alarm do not reach them until just before the police arrive
they sleep at the extreme back of the house and could not possibly have hear anything
so far the housekeeper could add nothing on cross examination save lamentations and expressions of amazement
cecil barker succeed mrs
allen as a witness
as to the occurrences of the night before he have very little to add to what he have already tell the police
personally he be convince that the murderer have escape by the window
the bloodstain be conclusive in his opinion on that point
besides as the bridge be up there be no other possible way of escape
he could not explain what have become of the assassin or why he have not take his bicycle if it be indeed his
he could not possibly have be drown in the moat which be at no place more than three feet deep
in his own mind he have a very definite theory about the murder
douglas be a reticent man and there be some chapters in his life of which he never speak
he have emigrate to america when he be a very young man
he have prosper well and barker have first meet him in california where they have become partner in a successful mine claim at a place call benito canyon
they have do very well but douglas have suddenly sell out and start for england
he be a widower at that time
barker have afterwards realize his money and come to live in london
thus they have renew their friendship
douglas have give him the impression that some danger be hang over his head and he have always look upon his sudden departure from california and also his rent a house in so quiet a place in england as be connect with this peril
he imagine that some secret society some implacable organization be on douglas's track which would never rest until it kill him
some remark of his have give him this idea though he have never tell him what the society be nor how he have come to offend it
he could only suppose that the legend upon the placard have some reference to this secret society
how long be you with douglas in california
ask inspector macdonald
five years altogether
he be a bachelor you say
a widower
have you ever hear where his first wife come from
no i remember his say that she be of german extraction and i have see her portrait
she be a very beautiful woman
she die of typhoid the year before i meet him
you don't associate his past with any particular part of america
i have hear him talk of chicago
he know that city well and have work there
i have hear him talk of the coal and iron district
he have travel a good deal in his time
be he a politician
have this secret society to do with politics
no he care nothing about politics
you have no reason to think it be criminal
on the contrary i never meet a straighter man in my life
be there anything curious about his life in california
he like best to stay and to work at our claim in the mountains
he would never go where other men be if he could help it
that's why i first think that someone be after him
then when he leave so suddenly for europe i make sure that it be so
i believe that he have a warn of some sort
within a week of his leave half a dozen men be inquire for him
what sort of men
well they be a mighty hard look crowd
they come up to the claim and want to know where he be
i tell them that he be go to europe and that i do not know where to find him
they mean him no good it be easy to see that
be these men americans californians
well i don't know about californians
they be americans all right
but they be not miners
i don't know what they be and be very glad to see their back
that be six years ago
nearer seven
and then you be together five years in california so that this business date back not less than eleven years at the least
that be so
it must be a very serious feud that would be keep up with such earnestness for as long as that
it would be no light thing that would give rise to it
i think it shadow his whole life
it be never quite out of his mind
but if a man have a danger hang over him and know what it be don't you think he would turn to the police for protection
maybe it be some danger that he could not be protect against
there's one thing you should know
he always go about arm
his revolver be never out of his pocket
but by bad luck he be in his dress gown and have leave it in the bedroom last night
once the bridge be up i guess he think he be safe
i should like these date a little clearer say macdonald
it be quite six years since douglas leave california
you follow him next year do you not
that be so
and he have be marry five years
you must have return about the time of his marriage
about a month before
i be his best man
do you know mrs
douglas before her marriage
no i do not
i have be away from england for ten years
but you have see a good deal of her since
barker look sternly at the detective
i have see a good deal of him since he answer
if i have see her it be because you cannot visit a man without know his wife
if you imagine there be any connection i imagine nothing mr
barker
i be bind to make every inquiry which can bear upon the case
but i mean no offense
some inquiries be offensive barker answer angrily
it's only the facts that we want
it be in your interest and everyone's interest that they should be clear up
do mr
douglas entirely approve your friendship with his wife
barker grow paler and his great strong hand be clasp convulsively together
you have no right to ask such question
he cry
what have this to do with the matter you be investigate
i must repeat the question
well i refuse to answer
you can refuse to answer but you must be aware that your refusal be in itself an answer for you would not refuse if you have not something to conceal
barker stand for a moment with his face set grimly and his strong black eyebrows draw low in intense think
then he look up with a smile
well i guess you gentlemen be only do your clear duty after all and i have no right to stand in the way of it
i'd only ask you not to worry mrs
douglas over this matter for she have enough upon her just now
i may tell you that poor douglas have just one fault in the world and that be his jealousy
he be fond of me no man could be fonder of a friend
and he be devote to his wife
he love me to come here and be forever send for me
and yet if his wife and i talk together or there seem any sympathy between us a kind of wave of jealousy would pass over him and he would be off the handle and say the wildest things in a moment
more than once i've swear off come for that reason and then he would write me such penitent implore letter that i just have to
but you can take it from me gentlemen if it be my last word that no man ever have a more love faithful wife and i can say also no friend could be more loyal than i
it be speak with fervour and feel and yet inspector macdonald could not dismiss the subject
you be aware say he that the dead man's wed ring have be take from his finger
so it appear say barker
what do you mean by 'appears'
you know it as a fact
the man seem confuse and undecided
when i say 'appears' i mean that it be conceivable that he have himself take off the ring
the mere fact that the ring should be absent whoever may have remove it would suggest to anyone's mind would it not that the marriage and the tragedy be connect
barker shrug his broad shoulder
i can't profess to say what it mean
he answer
but if you mean to hint that it could reflect in any way upon this lady's honour his eye blaze for an instant and then with an evident effort he get a grip upon his own emotions well you be on the wrong track that's all
i don't know that i've anything else to ask you at present say macdonald coldly
there be one small point remark sherlock holmes
when you enter the room there be only a candle light on the table be there not
yes that be so
by its light you saw that some terrible incident have occur
exactly
you at once ring for help
yes
and it arrive very speedily
within a minute or so
and yet when they arrive they find that the candle be out and that the lamp have be light
that seem very remarkable
again barker show some sign of indecision
i don't see that it be remarkable mr
holmes he answer after a pause
the candle throw a very bad light
my first think be to get a better one
the lamp be on the table so i light it
and blow out the candle
exactly
holmes ask no further question and barker with a deliberate look from one to the other of us which have as it seem to me something of defiance in it turn and leave the room
inspector macdonald have send up a note to the effect that he would wait upon mrs
douglas in her room but she have reply that she would meet us in the din room
she enter now a tall and beautiful woman of thirty reserve and self possess to a remarkable degree very different from the tragic and distract figure i have picture
it be true that her face be pale and draw like that of one who have endure a great shock but her manner be compose and the finely mould hand which she rest upon the edge of the table be as steady as my own
her sad appeal eye travel from one to the other of us with a curiously inquisitive expression
that question gaze transform itself suddenly into abrupt speech
have you find anything out yet
she ask
be it my imagination that there be an undertone of fear rather than of hope in the question
we have take every possible step mrs
douglas say the inspector
you may rest assure that nothing will be neglect
spare no money she say in a dead even tone
it be my desire that every possible effort should be make
perhaps you can tell us something which may throw some light upon the matter
i fear not but all i know be at your service
we have hear from mr
cecil barker that you do not actually see that you be never in the room where the tragedy occur
no he turn me back upon the stairs
he beg me to return to my room
quite so
you have hear the shoot and you have at once come down
i put on my dress gown and then come down
how long be it after hear the shoot that you be stop on the stair by mr
barker
it may have be a couple of minutes
it be so hard to reckon time at such a moment
he implore me not to go on
he assure me that i could do nothing
then mrs
allen the housekeeper lead me upstairs again
it be all like some dreadful dream
can you give us any idea how long your husband have be downstairs before you hear the shoot
no i cannot say
he go from his dress room and i do not hear him go
he do the round of the house every night for he be nervous of fire
it be the only thing that i have ever know him nervous of
that be just the point which i want to come to mrs
douglas
you have know your husband only in england have you not
yes we have be marry five years
have you hear him speak of anything which occur in america and might bring some danger upon him
mrs
douglas think earnestly before she answer
yes
she say at last i have always felt that there be a danger hang over him
he refuse to discuss it with me
it be not from want of confidence in me there be the most complete love and confidence between us but it be out of his desire to keep all alarm away from me
he think i should brood over it if i know all and so he be silent
how do you know it then
mrs
douglas's face light with a quick smile
can a husband ever carry about a secret all his life and a woman who love him have no suspicion of it
i know it by his refusal to talk about some episodes in his american life
i know it by certain precautions he take
i know it by certain word he let fall
i know it by the way he look at unexpected strangers
i be perfectly certain that he have some powerful enemies that he believe they be on his track and that he be always on his guard against them
i be so sure of it that for years i have be terrify if ever he come home later than be expect
might i ask ask holmes what the word be which attract your attention
the valley of fear the lady answer
that be an expression he have use when i question him
'i have be in the valley of fear
i be not out of it yet '
'are we never to get out of the valley of fear '
i have ask him when i have see him more serious than usual
'sometimes i think that we never shall ' he have answer
surely you ask him what he mean by the valley of fear
i do but his face would become very grave and he would shake his head
'it be bad enough that one of us should have be in its shadow ' he say
'please god it shall never fall upon you '
it be some real valley in which he have live and in which something terrible have occur to him of that i be certain but i can tell you no more
and he never mention any name
yes he be delirious with fever once when he have his hunt accident three years ago
then i remember that there be a name that come continually to his lips
he speak it with anger and a sort of horror
mcginty be the name bodymaster mcginty
i ask him when he recover who bodymaster mcginty be and whose body he be master of
'never of mine thank god '
he answer with a laugh and that be all i could get from him
but there be a connection between bodymaster mcginty and the valley of fear
there be one other point say inspector macdonald
you meet mr
douglas in a board house in london do you not and become engage to him there
be there any romance anything secret or mysterious about the wed
there be romance
there be always romance
there be nothing mysterious
he have no rival
no i be quite free
you have hear no doubt that his wed ring have be take
do that suggest anything to you
suppose that some enemy of his old life have track him down and commit this crime what possible reason could he have for take his wed ring
for an instant i could have swear that the faintest shadow of a smile flicker over the woman's lips
i really cannot tell she answer
it be certainly a most extraordinary thing
well we will not detain you any longer and we be sorry to have put you to this trouble at such a time say the inspector
there be some other point no doubt but we can refer to you as they arise
she rise and i be again conscious of that quick question glance with which she have just survey us
what impression have my evidence make upon you
the question might as well have be speak
then with a bow she sweep from the room
she's a beautiful woman a very beautiful woman say macdonald thoughtfully after the door have close behind her
this man barker have certainly be down here a good deal
he be a man who might be attractive to a woman
he admit that the dead man be jealous and maybe he know best himself what cause he have for jealousy
then there's that wed ring
you can't get past that
the man who tear a wed ring off a dead man's what do you say to it mr
holmes
my friend have sit with his head upon his hand sink in the deepest think
now he rise and ring the bell
ames he say when the butler enter where be mr
cecil barker now
i'll see sir
he come back in a moment to say that barker be in the garden
can you remember ames what mr
barker have on his feet last night when you join him in the study
yes mr
holmes
he have a pair of bedroom slippers
i bring him his boot when he go for the police
where be the slippers now
they be still under the chair in the hall
very good ames
it be of course important for us to know which track may be mr
barker's and which from outside
yes sir
i may say that i notice that the slippers be stain with blood so indeed be my own
that be natural enough consider the condition of the room
very good ames
we will ring if we want you
a few minutes later we be in the study
holmes have bring with him the carpet slippers from the hall
as ames have observe the sole of both be dark with blood
strange
murmur holmes as he stand in the light of the window and examine them minutely
very strange indeed
stoop with one of his quick feline pounce he place the slipper upon the blood mark on the sill
it exactly correspond
he smile in silence at his colleagues
the inspector be transfigure with excitement
his native accent rattle like a stick upon rail
man he cry there's not a doubt of it
barker have just mark the window himself
it's a good deal broader than any bootmark
i mind that you say it be a splay foot and here's the explanation
but what's the game mr
holmes what's the game
ay what's the game
my friend repeat thoughtfully
white mason chuckle and rub his fat hand together in his professional satisfaction
i say it be a snorter
he cry
and a real snorter it be
the three detectives have many matter of detail into which to inquire so i return alone to our modest quarter at the village inn
but before do so i take a stroll in the curious old world garden which flank the house
row of very ancient yew tree cut into strange design gird it round
inside be a beautiful stretch of lawn with an old sundial in the middle the whole effect so soothe and restful that it be welcome to my somewhat jangle nerve
in that deeply peaceful atmosphere one could forget or remember only as some fantastic nightmare that darken study with the sprawl bloodstained figure on the floor
and yet as i stroll round it and try to steep my soul in its gentle balm a strange incident occur which bring me back to the tragedy and leave a sinister impression in my mind
i have say that a decoration of yew tree circle the garden
at the end farthest from the house they thicken into a continuous hedge
on the other side of this hedge conceal from the eye of anyone approach from the direction of the house there be a stone seat
as i approach the spot i be aware of voice some remark in the deep tone of a man answer by a little ripple of feminine laughter
an instant later i have come round the end of the hedge and my eye light upon mrs
douglas and the man barker before they be aware of my presence
her appearance give me a shock
in the din room she have be demure and discreet
now all pretense of grief have pass away from her
her eye shine with the joy of live and her face still quiver with amusement at some remark of her companion
he sit forward his hand clasp and his forearm on his knees with an answer smile upon his bold handsome face
in an instant but it be just one instant too late they resume their solemn mask as my figure come into view
a hurry word or two pass between them and then barker rise and come towards me
excuse me sir say he but be i address dr
watson
i bow with a coldness which show i dare say very plainly the impression which have be produce upon my mind
we think that it be probably you as your friendship with mr
sherlock holmes be so well know
would you mind come over and speak to mrs
douglas for one instant
i follow him with a dour face
very clearly i could see in my mind's eye that shatter figure on the floor
here within a few hours of the tragedy be his wife and his nearest friend laugh together behind a bush in the garden which have be his
i greet the lady with reserve
i have grieve with her grief in the din room
now i meet her appeal gaze with an unresponsive eye
i fear that you think me callous and hard hearted
say she
i shrug my shoulder
it be no business of mine say i
perhaps some day you will do me justice
if you only realize there be no need why dr
watson should realize say barker quickly
as he have himself say it be no possible business of his
exactly say i and so i will beg leave to resume my walk
one moment dr
watson cry the woman in a plead voice
there be one question which you can answer with more authority than anyone else in the world and it may make a very great difference to me
you know mr
holmes and his relations with the police better than anyone else can
suppose that a matter be bring confidentially to his knowledge be it absolutely necessary that he should pass it on to the detectives
yes that's it say barker eagerly
be he on his own or be he entirely in with them
i really don't know that i should be justify in discuss such a point
i beg i implore that you will dr
watson
i assure you that you will be help us help me greatly if you will guide us on that point
there be such a ring of sincerity in the woman's voice that for the instant i forget all about her levity and be move only to do her will
mr
holmes be an independent investigator i say
he be his own master and would act as his own judgment direct
at the same time he would naturally feel loyalty towards the officials who be work on the same case and he would not conceal from them anything which would help them in bring a criminal to justice
beyond this i can say nothing and i would refer you to mr
holmes himself if you want fuller information
so say i raise my hat and go upon my way leave them still seat behind that conceal hedge
i look back as i round the far end of it and saw that they be still talk very earnestly together and as they be gaze after me it be clear that it be our interview that be the subject of their debate
i wish none of their confidences say holmes when i report to him what have occur
he have spend the whole afternoon at the manor house in consultation with his two colleagues and return about five with a ravenous appetite for a high tea which i have order for him
no confidences watson for they be mighty awkward if it come to an arrest for conspiracy and murder
you think it will come to that
he be in his most cheerful and debonair humour
my dear watson when i have exterminate that fourth egg i shall be ready to put you in touch with the whole situation
i don't say that we have fathom it far from it but when we have trace the miss dumb bell the dumb bell
dear me watson be it possible that you have not penetrate the fact that the case hang upon the miss dumb bell
well well you need not be downcast for between ourselves i don't think that either inspector mac or the excellent local practitioner have grasp the overwhelm importance of this incident
one dumb bell watson
consider an athlete with one dumb bell
picture to yourself the unilateral development the imminent danger of a spinal curvature
shock watson shock
he sit with his mouth full of toast and his eye sparkle with mischief watch my intellectual entanglement
the mere sight of his excellent appetite be an assurance of success for i have very clear recollections of days and nights without a think of food when his baffle mind have chafe before some problem while his thin eager feature become more attenuate with the asceticism of complete mental concentration
finally he light his pipe and sit in the inglenook of the old village inn he talk slowly and at random about his case rather as one who think aloud than as one who make a consider statement
a lie watson a great big thump obtrusive uncompromising lie that's what meet us on the threshold
there be our start point
the whole story tell by barker be a lie
but barker's story be corroborate by mrs
douglas
therefore she be lie also
they be both lie and in a conspiracy
so now we have the clear problem
why be they lie and what be the truth which they be try so hard to conceal
let us try watson you and i if we can get behind the lie and reconstruct the truth
how do i know that they be lie
because it be a clumsy fabrication which simply could not be true
consider
accord to the story give to us the assassin have less than a minute after the murder have be commit to take that ring which be under another ring from the dead man's finger to replace the other ring a thing which he would surely never have do and to put that singular card beside his victim
i say that this be obviously impossible
you may argue but i have too much respect for your judgment watson to think that you will do so that the ring may have be take before the man be kill
the fact that the candle have be light only a short time show that there have be no lengthy interview
be douglas from what we hear of his fearless character a man who would be likely to give up his wed ring at such short notice or could we conceive of his give it up at all
no no watson the assassin be alone with the dead man for some time with the lamp light
of that i have no doubt at all
but the gunshot be apparently the cause of death
therefore the shoot must have be fire some time earlier than we be tell
but there could be no mistake about such a matter as that
we be in the presence therefore of a deliberate conspiracy upon the part of the two people who hear the gunshot of the man barker and of the woman douglas
when on the top of this i be able to show that the blood mark on the windowsill be deliberately place there by barker in order to give a false clue to the police you will admit that the case grow dark against him
now we have to ask ourselves at what hour the murder actually do occur
up to half past ten the servants be move about the house so it be certainly not before that time
at a quarter to eleven they have all go to their room with the exception of ames who be in the pantry
i have be try some experiment after you leave us this afternoon and i find that no noise which macdonald can make in the study can penetrate to me in the pantry when the doors be all shut
it be otherwise however from the housekeeper's room
it be not so far down the corridor and from it i could vaguely hear a voice when it be very loudly raise
the sound from a shotgun be to some extent muffle when the discharge be at very close range as it undoubtedly be in this instance
it would not be very loud and yet in the silence of the night it should have easily penetrate to mrs
allen's room
she be as she have tell us somewhat deaf but none the less she mention in her evidence that she do hear something like a door slam half an hour before the alarm be give
half an hour before the alarm be give would be a quarter to eleven
i have no doubt that what she hear be the report of the gun and that this be the real instant of the murder
if this be so we have now to determine what barker and mrs
douglas presume that they be not the actual murderers could have be do from quarter to eleven when the sound of the shoot bring them down until quarter past eleven when they ring the bell and summon the servants
what be they do and why do they not instantly give the alarm
that be the question which face us and when it have be answer we shall surely have go some way to solve our problem
i be convince myself say i that there be an understand between those two people
she must be a heartless creature to sit laugh at some jest within a few hours of her husband's murder
exactly
she do not shine as a wife even in her own account of what occur
i be not a whole souled admirer of womankind as you be aware watson but my experience of life have teach me that there be few wive have any regard for their husband who would let any man's speak word stand between them and that husband's dead body
should i ever marry watson i should hope to inspire my wife with some feel which would prevent her from be walk off by a housekeeper when my corpse be lie within a few yards of her
it be badly stage manage for even the rawest investigators must be strike by the absence of the usual feminine ululation
if there have be nothing else this incident alone would have suggest a prearrange conspiracy to my mind
you think then definitely that barker and mrs
douglas be guilty of the murder
there be an appal directness about your question watson say holmes shake his pipe at me
they come at me like bullets
if you put it that mrs
douglas and barker know the truth about the murder and be conspire to conceal it then i can give you a whole souled answer
i be sure they do
but your more deadly proposition be not so clear
let us for a moment consider the difficulties which stand in the way
we will suppose that this couple be unite by the bond of a guilty love and that they have determine to get rid of the man who stand between them
it be a large supposition for discreet inquiry among servants and others have fail to corroborate it in any way
on the contrary there be a good deal of evidence that the douglases be very attach to each other
that i be sure cannot be true
say i think of the beautiful smile face in the garden
well at least they give that impression
however we will suppose that they be an extraordinarily astute couple who deceive everyone upon this point and conspire to murder the husband
he happen to be a man over whose head some danger hang we have only their word for that
holmes look thoughtful
i see watson
you be sketch out a theory by which everything they say from the begin be false
accord to your idea there be never any hide menace or secret society or valley of fear or boss macsomebody or anything else
well that be a good sweep generalization
let us see what that bring us to
they invent this theory to account for the crime
they then play up to the idea by leave this bicycle in the park as proof of the existence of some outsider
the stain on the windowsill convey the same idea
so do the card on the body which might have be prepare in the house
that all fit into your hypothesis watson
but now we come on the nasty angular uncompromising bits which won't slip into their place
why a cut off shotgun of all weapons and an american one at that
how could they be so sure that the sound of it would not bring someone on to them
it's a mere chance as it be that mrs
allen do not start out to inquire for the slam door
why do your guilty couple do all this watson
i confess that i can't explain it
then again if a woman and her lover conspire to murder a husband be they go to advertise their guilt by ostentatiously remove his wed ring after his death
do that strike you as very probable watson
no it do not
and once again if the think of leave a bicycle conceal outside have occur to you would it really have seem worth do when the dullest detective would naturally say this be an obvious blind as the bicycle be the first thing which the fugitive need in order to make his escape
i can conceive of no explanation
and yet there should be no combination of events for which the wit of man cannot conceive an explanation
simply as a mental exercise without any assertion that it be true let me indicate a possible line of think
it be i admit mere imagination but how often be imagination the mother of truth
we will suppose that there be a guilty secret a really shameful secret in the life of this man douglas
this lead to his murder by someone who be we will suppose an avenger someone from outside
this avenger for some reason which i confess i be still at a loss to explain take the dead man's wed ring
the vendetta might conceivably date back to the man's first marriage and the ring be take for some such reason
before this avenger get away barker and the wife have reach the room
the assassin convince them that any attempt to arrest him would lead to the publication of some hideous scandal
they be convert to this idea and prefer to let him go
for this purpose they probably lower the bridge which can be do quite noiselessly and then raise it again
he make his escape and for some reason think that he could do so more safely on foot than on the bicycle
he therefore leave his machine where it would not be discover until he have get safely away
so far we be within the bound of possibility be we not
well it be possible no doubt say i with some reserve
we have to remember watson that whatever occur be certainly something very extraordinary
well now to continue our supposititious case the couple not necessarily a guilty couple realize after the murderer be go that they have place themselves in a position in which it may be difficult for them to prove that they do not themselves either do the deed or connive at it
they rapidly and rather clumsily meet the situation
the mark be put by barker's bloodstained slipper upon the window sill to suggest how the fugitive get away
they obviously be the two who must have hear the sound of the gun so they give the alarm exactly as they would have do but a good half hour after the event
and how do you propose to prove all this
well if there be an outsider he may be trace and take
that would be the most effective of all proof
but if not well the resources of science be far from be exhaust
i think that an even alone in that study would help me much
an even alone
i propose to go up there presently
i have arrange it with the estimable ames who be by no mean whole hearted about barker
i shall sit in that room and see if its atmosphere bring me inspiration
i'm a believer in the genius loci
you smile friend watson
well we shall see
by the way you have that big umbrella of yours have you not
it be here
well i'll borrow that if i may
certainly but what a wretched weapon
if there be danger nothing serious my dear watson or i should certainly ask for your assistance
but i'll take the umbrella
at present i be only await the return of our colleagues from tunbridge well where they be at present engage in try for a likely owner to the bicycle
it be nightfall before inspector macdonald and white mason come back from their expedition and they arrive exultant report a great advance in our investigation
man i'll admeet that i have my doubt if there be ever an outsider say macdonald but that's all past now
we've have the bicycle identify and we have a description of our man so that's a long step on our journey
it sound to me like the begin of the end say holmes
i'm sure i congratulate you both with all my heart
well i start from the fact that mr
douglas have seem disturb since the day before when he have be at tunbridge well
it be at tunbridge well then that he have become conscious of some danger
it be clear therefore that if a man have come over with a bicycle it be from tunbridge well that he might be expect to have come
we take the bicycle over with us and show it at the hotels
it be identify at once by the manager of the eagle commercial as belong to a man name hargrave who have take a room there two days before
this bicycle and a small valise be his whole belong
he have register his name as come from london but have give no address
the valise be london make and the content be british but the man himself be undoubtedly an american
well well say holmes gleefully you have indeed do some solid work while i have be sit spin theories with my friend
it's a lesson in be practical mr
mac
ay it's just that mr
holmes say the inspector with satisfaction
but this may all fit in with your theories i remark
that may or may not be
but let us hear the end mr
mac
be there nothing to identify this man
so little that it be evident that he have carefully guard himself against identification
there be no paper or letter and no mark upon the clothe
a cycle map of the county lay on his bedroom table
he have leave the hotel after breakfast yesterday morning on his bicycle and no more be hear of him until our inquiries
that's what puzzle me mr
holmes say white mason
if the fellow do not want the hue and cry raise over him one would imagine that he would have return and remain at the hotel as an inoffensive tourist
as it be he must know that he will be report to the police by the hotel manager and that his disappearance will be connect with the murder
so one would imagine
still he have be justify of his wisdom up to date at any rate since he have not be take
but his description what of that
macdonald refer to his notebook
here we have it so far as they could give it
they don't seem to have take any very particular stock of him but still the porter the clerk and the chambermaid be all agree that this about cover the point
he be a man about five foot nine in height fifty or so years of age his hair slightly grizzle a grayish moustache a curve nose and a face which all of them describe as fierce and forbid
well bar the expression that might almost be a description of douglas himself say holmes
he be just over fifty with grizzle hair and moustache and about the same height
do you get anything else
he be dress in a heavy gray suit with a reefer jacket and he wear a short yellow overcoat and a soft cap
what about the shotgun
it be less than two feet long
it could very well have fit into his valise
he could have carry it inside his overcoat without difficulty
and how do you consider that all this bear upon the general case
well mr
holmes say macdonald when we have get our man and you may be sure that i have his description on the wire within five minutes of hear it we shall be better able to judge
but even as it stand we have surely go a long way
we know that an american call himself hargrave come to tunbridge well two days ago with bicycle and valise
in the latter be a saw off shotgun so he come with the deliberate purpose of crime
yesterday morning he set off for this place on his bicycle with his gun conceal in his overcoat
no one saw him arrive so far as we can learn but he need not pass through the village to reach the park gate and there be many cyclists upon the road
presumably he at once conceal his cycle among the laurels where it be find and possibly lurk there himself with his eye on the house wait for mr
douglas to come out
the shotgun be a strange weapon to use inside a house but he have intend to use it outside and there it have very obvious advantage as it would be impossible to miss with it and the sound of shots be so common in an english sport neighbourhood that no particular notice would be take
that be all very clear say holmes
well mr
douglas do not appear
what be he to do next
he leave his bicycle and approach the house in the twilight
he find the bridge down and no one about
he take his chance intend no doubt to make some excuse if he meet anyone
he meet no one
he slip into the first room that he saw and conceal himself behind the curtain
thence he could see the drawbridge go up and he know that his only escape be through the moat
he wait until quarter past eleven when mr
douglas upon his usual nightly round come into the room
he shoot him and escape as arrange
he be aware that the bicycle would be describe by the hotel people and be a clue against him so he leave it there and make his way by some other mean to london or to some safe hide place which he have already arrange
how be that mr
holmes
well mr
mac it be very good and very clear so far as it go
that be your end of the story
my end be that the crime be commit half an hour earlier than report that mrs
douglas and barker be both in a conspiracy to conceal something that they aid the murderer's escape or at least that they reach the room before he escape and that they fabricate evidence of his escape through the window whereas in all probability they have themselves let him go by lower the bridge
that's my read of the first half
the two detectives shake their head
well mr
holmes if this be true we only tumble out of one mystery into another say the london inspector
and in some ways a worse one add white mason
the lady have never be in america in all her life
what possible connection could she have with an american assassin which would cause her to shelter him
i freely admit the difficulties say holmes
i propose to make a little investigation of my own to night and it be just possible that it may contribute something to the common cause
can we help you mr
holmes
no no
darkness and dr
watson's umbrella my want be simple
and ames the faithful ames no doubt he will stretch a point for me
all my line of think lead me back invariably to the one basic question why should an athletic man develop his frame upon so unnatural an instrument as a single dumb bell
it be late that night when holmes return from his solitary excursion
we sleep in a double bed room which be the best that the little country inn could do for us
i be already asleep when i be partly awaken by his entrance
well holmes i murmur have you find anything out
he stand beside me in silence his candle in his hand
then the tall lean figure incline towards me
i say watson he whisper would you be afraid to sleep in the same room with a lunatic a man with soften of the brain an idiot whose mind have lose its grip
not in the least i answer in astonishment
ah that's lucky he say and not another word would he utter that night
next morning after breakfast we find inspector macdonald and white mason seat in close consultation in the small parlour of the local police sergeant
on the table in front of them be pile a number of letter and telegrams which they be carefully sort and docket
three have be place on one side
still on the track of the elusive bicyclist
holmes ask cheerfully
what be the latest news of the ruffian
macdonald point ruefully to his heap of correspondence
he be at present report from leicester nottingham southampton derby east ham richmond and fourteen other place
in three of them east ham leicester and liverpool there be a clear case against him and he have actually be arrest
the country seem to be full of the fugitives with yellow coat
dear me
say holmes sympathetically
now mr
mac and you mr
white mason i wish to give you a very earnest piece of advice
when i go into this case with you i bargain as you will no doubt remember that i should not present you with half prove theories but that i should retain and work out my own ideas until i have satisfy myself that they be correct
for this reason i be not at the present moment tell you all that be in my mind
on the other hand i say that i would play the game fairly by you and i do not think it be a fair game to allow you for one unnecessary moment to waste your energies upon a profitless task
therefore i be here to advise you this morning and my advice to you be sum up in three word abandon the case
macdonald and white mason star in amazement at their celebrate colleague
you consider it hopeless
cry the inspector
i consider your case to be hopeless
i do not consider that it be hopeless to arrive at the truth
but this cyclist
he be not an invention
we have his description his valise his bicycle
the fellow must be somewhere
why should we not get him
yes yes no doubt he be somewhere and no doubt we shall get him but i would not have you waste your energies in east ham or liverpool
i be sure that we can find some shorter cut to a result
you be hold something back
it's hardly fair of you mr
holmes
the inspector be annoy
you know my methods of work mr
mac
but i will hold it back for the shortest time possible
i only wish to verify my detail in one way which can very readily be do and then i make my bow and return to london leave my result entirely at your service
i owe you too much to act otherwise for in all my experience i cannot recall any more singular and interest study
this be clean beyond me mr
holmes
we saw you when we return from tunbridge well last night and you be in general agreement with our result
what have happen since then to give you a completely new idea of the case
well since you ask me i spend as i tell you that i would some hours last night at the manor house
well what happen
ah i can only give you a very general answer to that for the moment
by the way i have be read a short but clear and interest account of the old build purchasable at the modest sum of one penny from the local tobacconist
here holmes draw a small tract embellish with a rude engrave of the ancient manor house from his waistcoat pocket
it immensely add to the zest of an investigation my dear mr
mac when one be in conscious sympathy with the historical atmosphere of one's surround
don't look so impatient for i assure you that even so bald an account as this raise some sort of picture of the past in one's mind
permit me to give you a sample
'erected in the fifth year of the reign of jam i and stand upon the site of a much older build the manor house of birlstone present one of the finest survive examples of the moated jacobean residence ' you be make fool of us mr
holmes
tut tut mr
mac the first sign of temper i have detect in you
well i won't read it verbatim since you feel so strongly upon the subject
but when i tell you that there be some account of the take of the place by a parliamentary colonel in of the concealment of charles for several days in the course of the civil war and finally of a visit there by the second george you will admit that there be various associations of interest connect with this ancient house
i don't doubt it mr
holmes but that be no business of ours
be it not
be it not
breadth of view my dear mr
mac be one of the essentials of our profession
the interplay of ideas and the oblique use of knowledge be often of extraordinary interest
you will excuse these remark from one who though a mere connoisseur of crime be still rather older and perhaps more experience than yourself
i'm the first to admit that say the detective heartily
you get to your point i admit but you have such a deuced round the corner way of do it
well well i'll drop past history and get down to present day facts
i call last night as i have already say at the manor house
i do not see either barker or mrs
douglas
i saw no necessity to disturb them but i be please to hear that the lady be not visibly pin and that she have partake of an excellent dinner
my visit be specially make to the good mr
ames with whom i exchange some amiabilities which culminate in his allow me without reference to anyone else to sit alone for a time in the study
what
with that
i ejaculate
no no everything be now in order
you give permission for that mr
mac as i be inform
the room be in its normal state and in it i pass an instructive quarter of an hour
what be you do
well not to make a mystery of so simple a matter i be look for the miss dumb bell
it have always bulk rather large in my estimate of the case
i end by find it
where
ah there we come to the edge of the unexplored
let me go a little further a very little further and i will promise that you shall share everything that i know
well we're bind to take you on your own term say the inspector but when it come to tell us to abandon the case why in the name of goodness should we abandon the case
for the simple reason my dear mr
mac that you have not get the first idea what it be that you be investigate
we be investigate the murder of mr
john douglas of birlstone manor
yes yes so you be
but don't trouble to trace the mysterious gentleman upon the bicycle
i assure you that it won't help you
then what do you suggest that we do
i will tell you exactly what to do if you will do it
well i'm bind to say i've always find you have reason behind all your queer ways
i'll do what you advise
and you mr
white mason
the country detective look helplessly from one to the other
holmes and his methods be new to him
well if it be good enough for the inspector it be good enough for me he say at last
capital
say holmes
well then i should recommend a nice cheery country walk for both of you
they tell me that the view from birlstone ridge over the weald be very remarkable
no doubt lunch could be get at some suitable hostelry though my ignorance of the country prevent me from recommend one
in the even tire but happy man this be get past a joke
cry macdonald rise angrily from his chair
well well spend the day as you like say holmes pat him cheerfully upon the shoulder
do what you like and go where you will but meet me here before dusk without fail without fail mr
mac
that sound more like sanity
all of it be excellent advice but i don't insist so long as you be here when i need you
but now before we part i want you to write a note to mr
barker
well
i'll dictate it if you like
ready
dear sir it have strike me that it be our duty to drain the moat in the hope that we may find some it's impossible say the inspector
i've make inquiry
tut tut
my dear sir please do what i ask you
well go on
in the hope that we may find something which may bear upon our investigation
i have make arrangements and the workmen will be at work early to morrow morning divert the stream impossible
divert the stream so i think it best to explain matter beforehand
now sign that and send it by hand about four o'clock
at that hour we shall meet again in this room
until then we may each do what we like for i can assure you that this inquiry have come to a definite pause
even be draw in when we reassemble
holmes be very serious in his manner myself curious and the detectives obviously critical and annoy
well gentlemen say my friend gravely i be ask you now to put everything to the test with me and you will judge for yourselves whether the observations i have make justify the conclusions to which i have come
it be a chill even and i do not know how long our expedition may last so i beg that you will wear your warmest coat
it be of the first importance that we should be in our place before it grow dark so with your permission we shall get start at once
we pass along the outer bound of the manor house park until we come to a place where there be a gap in the rail which fence it
through this we slip and then in the gather gloom we follow holmes until we have reach a shrubbery which lie nearly opposite to the main door and the drawbridge
the latter have not be raise
holmes crouch down behind the screen of laurels and we all three follow his example
well what be we to do now
ask macdonald with some gruffness
possess our souls in patience and make as little noise as possible holmes answer
what be we here for at all
i really think that you might treat us with more frankness
holmes laugh
watson insist that i be the dramatist in real life say he
some touch of the artist well up within me and call insistently for a well stag performance
surely our profession mr
mac would be a drab and sordid one if we do not sometimes set the scene so as to glorify our result
the blunt accusation the brutal tap upon the shoulder what can one make of such a denouement
but the quick inference the subtle trap the clever forecast of come events the triumphant vindication of bold theories be these not the pride and the justification of our life's work
at the present moment you thrill with the glamour of the situation and the anticipation of the hunt
where would be that thrill if i have be as definite as a timetable
i only ask a little patience mr
mac and all will be clear to you
well i hope the pride and justification and the rest of it will come before we all get our death of cold say the london detective with comic resignation
we all have good reason to join in the aspiration for our vigil be a long and bitter one
slowly the shadow darken over the long sombre face of the old house
a cold damp reek from the moat chill us to the bone and set our teeth chatter
there be a single lamp over the gateway and a steady globe of light in the fatal study
everything else be dark and still
how long be this to last
ask the inspector finally
and what be it we be watch for
i have no more notion than you how long it be to last holmes answer with some asperity
if criminals would always schedule their movements like railway train it would certainly be more convenient for all of us
as to what it be we well that's what we be watch for
as he speak the bright yellow light in the study be obscure by somebody pass to and fro before it
the laurels among which we lay be immediately opposite the window and not more than a hundred feet from it
presently it be throw open with a whine of hinge and we could dimly see the dark outline of a man's head and shoulder look out into the gloom
for some minutes he peer forth in furtive stealthy fashion as one who wish to be assure that he be unobserved
then he lean forward and in the intense silence we be aware of the soft lap of agitate water
he seem to be stir up the moat with something which he hold in his hand
then suddenly he haul something in as a fisherman land a fish some large round object which obscure the light as it be drag through the open casement
now
cry holmes
now
we be all upon our feet stagger after him with our stiffen limbs while he run swiftly across the bridge and ring violently at the bell
there be the rasp of bolt from the other side and the amaze ames stand in the entrance
holmes brush him aside without a word and follow by all of us rush into the room which have be occupy by the man whom we have be watch
the oil lamp on the table represent the glow which we have see from outside
it be now in the hand of cecil barker who hold it towards us as we enter
its light shine upon his strong resolute clean shave face and his menace eye
what the devil be the mean of all this
he cry
what be you after anyhow
holmes take a swift glance round and then pounce upon a sodden bundle tie together with cord which lay where it have be thrust under the write table
this be what we be after mr
barker this bundle weight with a dumb bell which you have just raise from the bottom of the moat
barker star at holmes with amazement in his face
how in thunder come you to know anything about it
he ask
simply that i put it there
you put it there
you
perhaps i should have say 'replaced it there ' say holmes
you will remember inspector macdonald that i be somewhat strike by the absence of a dumb bell
i draw your attention to it but with the pressure of other events you have hardly the time to give it the consideration which would have enable you to draw deductions from it
when water be near and a weight be miss it be not a very far fetch supposition that something have be sink in the water
the idea be at least worth test so with the help of ames who admit me to the room and the crook of dr
watson's umbrella i be able last night to fish up and inspect this bundle
it be of the first importance however that we should be able to prove who place it there
this we accomplish by the very obvious device of announce that the moat would be dry to morrow which have of course the effect that whoever have hide the bundle would most certainly withdraw it the moment that darkness enable him to do so
we have no less than four witness as to who it be who take advantage of the opportunity and so mr
barker i think the word lie now with you
sherlock holmes put the sop bundle upon the table beside the lamp and undo the cord which bind it
from within he extract a dumb bell which he toss down to its fellow in the corner
next he draw forth a pair of boot
american as you perceive he remark point to the toe
then he lay upon the table a long deadly sheathe knife
finally he unravel a bundle of clothe comprise a complete set of underclothes sock a gray tweed suit and a short yellow overcoat
the clothe be commonplace remark holmes save only the overcoat which be full of suggestive touch
he hold it tenderly towards the light
here as you perceive be the inner pocket prolong into the line in such fashion as to give ample space for the truncate fowl piece
the tailor's tab be on the neck 'neal outfitter vermissa u s
a '
i have spend an instructive afternoon in the rector's library and have enlarge my knowledge by add the fact that vermissa be a flourish little town at the head of one of the best know coal and iron valleys in the unite state
i have some recollection mr
barker that you associate the coal district with mr
douglas's first wife and it would surely not be too far fetch an inference that the v v upon the card by the dead body might stand for vermissa valley or that this very valley which send forth emissaries of murder may be that valley of fear of which we have hear
so much be fairly clear
and now mr
barker i seem to be stand rather in the way of your explanation
it be a sight to see cecil barker's expressive face during this exposition of the great detective
anger amazement consternation and indecision sweep over it in turn
finally he take refuge in a somewhat acrid irony
you know such a lot mr
holmes perhaps you have better tell us some more he sneer
i have no doubt that i could tell you a great deal more mr
barker but it would come with a better grace from you
oh you think so do you
well all i can say be that if there's any secret here it be not my secret and i be not the man to give it away
well if you take that line mr
barker say the inspector quietly we must just keep you in sight until we have the warrant and can hold you
you can do what you damn please about that say barker defiantly
the proceed seem to have come to a definite end so far as he be concern for one have only to look at that granite face to realize that no peine forte et dure would ever force him to plead against his will
the deadlock be break however by a woman's voice
mrs
douglas have be stand listen at the half open door and now she enter the room
you have do enough for now cecil say she
whatever come of it in the future you have do enough
enough and more than enough remark sherlock holmes gravely
i have every sympathy with you madam and should strongly urge you to have some confidence in the common sense of our jurisdiction and to take the police voluntarily into your complete confidence
it may be that i be myself at fault for not follow up the hint which you convey to me through my friend dr
watson but at that time i have every reason to believe that you be directly concern in the crime
now i be assure that this be not so
at the same time there be much that be unexplained and i should strongly recommend that you ask mr
douglas to tell us his own story
mrs
douglas give a cry of astonishment at holmes's word
the detectives and i must have echo it when we be aware of a man who seem to have emerge from the wall who advance now from the gloom of the corner in which he have appear
mrs
douglas turn and in an instant her arm be round him
barker have seize his outstretched hand
it's best this way jack his wife repeat i be sure that it be best
indeed yes mr
douglas say sherlock holmes i be sure that you will find it best
the man stand blink at us with the daze look of one who come from the dark into the light
it be a remarkable face bold gray eye a strong short clip grizzle moustache a square project chin and a humorous mouth
he take a good look at us all and then to my amazement he advance to me and hand me a bundle of paper
i've hear of you say he in a voice which be not quite english and not quite american but be altogether mellow and please
you be the historian of this bunch
well dr
watson you've never have such a story as that pass through your hand before and i'll lay my last dollar on that
tell it your own way but there be the facts and you can't miss the public so long as you have those
i've be cooped up two days and i've spend the daylight hours as much daylight as i could get in that rat trap in put the thing into word
you're welcome to them you and your public
there's the story of the valley of fear
that's the past mr
douglas say sherlock holmes quietly
what we desire now be to hear your story of the present
you'll have it sir say douglas
may i smoke as i talk
well thank you mr
holmes
you're a smoker yourself if i remember right and you'll guess what it be to be sit for two days with tobacco in your pocket and afraid that the smell will give you away
he lean against the mantelpiece and suck at the cigar which holmes have hand him
i've hear of you mr
holmes
i never guess that i should meet you
but before you be through with that he nod at my paper you will say i've bring you something fresh
inspector macdonald have be star at the newcomer with the greatest amazement
well this fairly beat me
he cry at last
if you be mr
john douglas of birlstone manor then whose death have we be investigate for these two days and where in the world have you spring from now
you seem to me to come out of the floor like a jack in a box
ah mr
mac say holmes shake a reprove forefinger you would not read that excellent local compilation which describe the concealment of king charles
people do not hide in those days without excellent hide place and the hide place that have once be use may be again
i have persuade myself that we should find mr
douglas under this roof
and how long have you be play this trick upon us mr
holmes
say the inspector angrily
how long have you allow us to waste ourselves upon a search that you know to be an absurd one
not one instant my dear mr
mac
only last night do i form my view of the case
as they could not be put to the proof until this even i invite you and your colleague to take a holiday for the day
pray what more could i do
when i find the suit of clothe in the moat it at once become apparent to me that the body we have find could not have be the body of mr
john douglas at all but must be that of the bicyclist from tunbridge well
no other conclusion be possible
therefore i have to determine where mr
john douglas himself could be and the balance of probability be that with the connivance of his wife and his friend he be conceal in a house which have such conveniences for a fugitive and await quieter time when he could make his final escape
well you figure it out about right say douglas approvingly
i think i'd dodge your british law for i be not sure how i stand under it and also i saw my chance to throw these hound once for all off my track
mind you from first to last i have do nothing to be ashamed of and nothing that i would not do again but you'll judge that for yourselves when i tell you my story
never mind warn me inspector i'm ready to stand pat upon the truth
i'm not go to begin at the begin
that's all there he indicate my bundle of paper and a mighty queer yarn you'll find it
it all come down to this that there be some men that have good cause to hate me and would give their last dollar to know that they have get me
so long as i be alive and they be alive there be no safety in this world for me
they hunt me from chicago to california then they chase me out of america but when i marry and settle down in this quiet spot i think my last years be go to be peaceable
i never explain to my wife how things be
why should i pull her into it
she would never have a quiet moment again but would always be imagine trouble
i fancy she know something for i may have drop a word here or a word there but until yesterday after you gentlemen have see her she never know the right of the matter
she tell you all she know and so do barker here for on the night when this thing happen there be mighty little time for explanations
she know everything now and i would have be a wiser man if i have tell her sooner
but it be a hard question dear he take her hand for an instant in his own and i act for the best
well gentlemen the day before these happen i be over in tunbridge well and i get a glimpse of a man in the street
it be only a glimpse but i have a quick eye for these things and i never doubt who it be
it be the worst enemy i have among them all one who have be after me like a hungry wolf after a caribou all these years
i know there be trouble come and i come home and make ready for it
i guess i'd fight through it all right on my own my luck be a proverb in the state about '
i never doubt that it would be with me still
i be on my guard all that next day and never go out into the park
it's as well or he'd have have the drop on me with that buckshot gun of his before ever i could draw on him
after the bridge be up my mind be always more restful when that bridge be up in the even i put the thing clear out of my head
i never dream of his get into the house and wait for me
but when i make my round in my dress gown as be my habit i have no sooner enter the study than i scent danger
i guess when a man have have dangers in his life and i've have more than most in my time there be a kind of sixth sense that wave the red flag
i saw the signal clear enough and yet i couldn't tell you why
next instant i spot a boot under the window curtain and then i saw why plain enough
i'd just the one candle that be in my hand but there be a good light from the hall lamp through the open door
i put down the candle and jump for a hammer that i'd leave on the mantel
at the same moment he spring at me
i saw the glint of a knife and i lash at him with the hammer
i get him somewhere for the knife tinkle down on the floor
he dodge round the table as quick as an eel and a moment later he'd get his gun from under his coat
i hear him cock it but i have get hold of it before he could fire
i have it by the barrel and we wrestle for it all end up for a minute or more
it be death to the man that lose his grip
he never lose his grip but he get it butt downward for a moment too long
maybe it be i that pull the trigger
maybe we just jolt it off between us
anyhow he get both barrel in the face and there i be star down at all that be leave of ted baldwin
i'd recognize him in the township and again when he spring for me but his own mother wouldn't recognize him as i saw him then
i'm use to rough work but i fairly turn sick at the sight of him
i be hang on the side of the table when barker come hurry down
i hear my wife come and i run to the door and stop her
it be no sight for a woman
i promise i'd come to her soon
i say a word or two to barker he take it all in at a glance and we wait for the rest to come along
but there be no sign of them
then we understand that they could hear nothing and that all that have happen be know only to ourselves
it be at that instant that the idea come to me
i be fairly dazzle by the brilliance of it
the man's sleeve have slip up and there be the brand mark of the lodge upon his forearm
see here
the man whom we have know as douglas turn up his own coat and cuff to show a brown triangle within a circle exactly like that which we have see upon the dead man
it be the sight of that which start me on it
i seem to see it all clear at a glance
there be his height and hair and figure about the same as my own
no one could swear to his face poor devil
i bring down this suit of clothe and in a quarter of an hour barker and i have put my dress gown on him and he lay as you find him
we tie all his things into a bundle and i weight them with the only weight i could find and put them through the window
the card he have mean to lay upon my body be lie beside his own
my ring be put on his finger but when it come to the wed ring he hold out his muscular hand you can see for yourselves that i have strike the limit
i have not move it since the day i be marry and it would have take a file to get it off
i don't know anyhow that i should have care to part with it but if i have want to i couldn't
so we just have to leave that detail to take care of itself
on the other hand i bring a bite of plaster down and put it where i be wear one myself at this instant
you slip up there mr
holmes clever as you be for if you have chance to take off that plaster you would have find no cut underneath it
well that be the situation
if i could lie low for a while and then get away where i could be join by my 'widow' we should have a chance at last of live in peace for the rest of our live
these devil would give me no rest so long as i be above grind but if they saw in the paper that baldwin have get his man there would be an end of all my trouble
i hadn't much time to make it all clear to barker and to my wife but they understand enough to be able to help me
i know all about this hide place so do ames but it never enter his head to connect it with the matter
i retire into it and it be up to barker to do the rest
i guess you can fill in for yourselves what he do
he open the window and make the mark on the sill to give an idea of how the murderer escape
it be a tall order that but as the bridge be up there be no other way
then when everything be fix he ring the bell for all he be worth
what happen afterward you know
and so gentlemen you can do what you please but i've tell you the truth and the whole truth so help me god
what i ask you now be how do i stand by the english law
there be a silence which be break by sherlock holmes
the english law be in the main a just law
you will get no worse than your desert from that mr
douglas
but i would ask you how do this man know that you live here or how to get into your house or where to hide to get you
i know nothing of this
holmes's face be very white and grave
the story be not over yet i fear say he
you may find worse dangers than the english law or even than your enemies from america
i see trouble before you mr
douglas
you'll take my advice and still be on your guard
and now my long suffer readers i will ask you to come away with me for a time far from the sussex manor house of birlstone and far also from the year of grace in which we make our eventful journey which end with the strange story of the man who have be know as john douglas
i wish you to journey back some twenty years in time and westward some thousands of miles in space that i may lay before you a singular and terrible narrative so singular and so terrible that you may find it hard to believe that even as i tell it even so do it occur
do not think that i intrude one story before another be finish
as you read on you will find that this be not so
and when i have detail those distant events and you have solve this mystery of the past we shall meet once more in those room on baker street where this like so many other wonderful happen will find its end
it be the fourth of february in the year
it have be a severe winter and the snow lay deep in the gorge of the gilmerton mountains
the steam plough have however keep the railroad open and the even train which connect the long line of coal mine and iron work settlements be slowly groan its way up the steep gradients which lead from stagville on the plain to vermissa the central township which lie at the head of vermissa valley
from this point the track sweep downward to bartons cross helmdale and the purely agricultural county of merton
it be a single track railroad but at every side and they be numerous long line of truck pile with coal and iron ore tell of the hide wealth which have bring a rude population and a bustle life to this most desolate corner of the unite state of america
for desolate it be
little could the first pioneer who have traverse it have ever imagine that the fairest prairies and the most lush water pasture be valueless compare to this gloomy land of black crag and tangle forest
above the dark and often scarcely penetrable woods upon their flank the high bare crown of the mountains white snow and jag rock tower upon each flank leave a long wind tortuous valley in the centre
up this the little train be slowly crawl
the oil lamps have just be light in the lead passenger car a long bare carriage in which some twenty or thirty people be seat
the greater number of these be workmen return from their day's toil in the lower part of the valley
at least a dozen by their grime face and the safety lanterns which they carry proclaim themselves miners
these sit smoke in a group and converse in low voice glance occasionally at two men on the opposite side of the car whose uniform and badge show them to be policemen
several women of the labour class and one or two travellers who might have be small local storekeepers make up the rest of the company with the exception of one young man in a corner by himself
it be with this man that we be concern
take a good look at him for he be worth it
he be a fresh complexion middle size young man not far one would guess from his thirtieth year
he have large shrewd humorous gray eye which twinkle inquiringly from time to time as he look round through his spectacles at the people about him
it be easy to see that he be of a sociable and possibly simple disposition anxious to be friendly to all men
anyone could pick him at once as gregarious in his habit and communicative in his nature with a quick wit and a ready smile
and yet the man who study him more closely might discern a certain firmness of jaw and grim tightness about the lips which would warn him that there be depths beyond and that this pleasant brown haired young irishman might conceivably leave his mark for good or evil upon any society to which he be introduce
have make one or two tentative remark to the nearest miner and receive only short gruff reply the traveller resign himself to uncongenial silence star moodily out of the window at the fade landscape
it be not a cheer prospect
through the grow gloom there pulse the red glow of the furnaces on the side of the hill
great heap of slag and dump of cinders loom up on each side with the high shaft of the collieries tower above them
huddle group of mean wooden house the windows of which be begin to outline themselves in light be scatter here and there along the line and the frequent halt place be crowd with their swarthy inhabitants
the iron and coal valleys of the vermissa district be no resort for the leisured or the culture
everywhere there be stern sign of the crudest battle of life the rude work to be do and the rude strong workers who do it
the young traveller gaze out into this dismal country with a face of mingle repulsion and interest which show that the scene be new to him
at intervals he draw from his pocket a bulky letter to which he refer and on the margins of which he scribble some note
once from the back of his waist he produce something which one would hardly have expect to find in the possession of so mild mannered a man
it be a navy revolver of the largest size
as he turn it slantwise to the light the glint upon the rim of the copper shell within the drum show that it be fully load
he quickly restore it to his secret pocket but not before it have be observe by a work man who have seat himself upon the adjoin bench
hullo mate
say he
you seem heel and ready
the young man smile with an air of embarrassment
yes say he we need them sometimes in the place i come from
and where may that be
i'm last from chicago
a stranger in these part
yes
you may find you need it here say the workman
ah
be that so
the young man seem interest

not yet but i have the mean of make them
how's that then
i be one of the eminent order of freemen
there's no town without a lodge and where there be a lodge i'll find my friends
the remark have a singular effect upon his companion
he glance round suspiciously at the others in the car
the miners be still whisper among themselves
the two police officer be doze
he come across seat himself close to the young traveller and hold out his hand
put it there he say
a hand grip pass between the two
i see you speak the truth say the workman
but it's well to make certain
he raise his right hand to his right eyebrow
the traveller at once raise his leave hand to his leave eyebrow
dark nights be unpleasant say the workman
yes for strangers to travel the other answer
that's good enough
i'm brother scanlan lodge vermissa valley
glad to see you in these part
thank you
i'm brother john mcmurdo lodge chicago
bodymaster j h scott
but i be in luck to meet a brother so early
well there be plenty of us about

but we could do with some lads like you
i can't understand a spry man of the union find no work to do in chicago

then why do you leave
mcmurdo nod towards the policemen and smile
i guess those chap would be glad to know he say
scanlan groan sympathetically
in trouble
he ask in a whisper
deep

it's early days to talk of such things say mcmurdo with the air of a man who have be surprise into say more than he intend
i've my own good reason for leave chicago and let that be enough for you
who be you that you should take it on yourself to ask such things
his gray eye gleam with sudden and dangerous anger from behind his glass
all right mate no offense mean
the boys will think none the worse of you whatever you may have do
where be you bind for now
vermissa
that's the third halt down the line
where be you stay
mcmurdo take out an envelope and hold it close to the murky oil lamp
here be the address jacob shafter sheridan street
it's a board house that be recommend by a man i know in chicago
well i don't know it but vermissa be out of my beat
i live at hobson's patch and that's here where we be draw up
but say there's one bite of advice i'll give you before we part if you're in trouble in vermissa go straight to the union house and see boss mcginty
he be the bodymaster of vermissa lodge and nothing can happen in these part unless black jack mcginty want it
so long mate
maybe we'll meet in lodge one of these even
but mind my word if you be in trouble go to boss mcginty
scanlan descend and mcmurdo be leave once again to his thoughts
night have now fall and the flame of the frequent furnaces be roar and leap in the darkness
against their lurid background dark figure be bend and strain twist and turn with the motion of winch or of windlass to the rhythm of an eternal clank and roar
i guess hell must look something like that say a voice
mcmurdo turn and saw that one of the policemen have shift in his seat and be star out into the fiery waste
for that matter say the other policeman i allow that hell must be something like that
if there be worse devil down yonder than some we could name it's more than i'd expect
i guess you be new to this part young man
well what if i be
mcmurdo answer in a surly voice
just this mister that i should advise you to be careful in choose your friends
i don't think i'd begin with mike scanlan or his gang if i be you
what the hell be it to you who be my friends
roar mcmurdo in a voice which bring every head in the carriage round to witness the altercation
do i ask you for your advice or do you think me such a sucker that i couldn't move without it
you speak when you be speak to and by the lord you'd have to wait a long time if it be me
he thrust out his face and grin at the patrolmen like a snarl dog
the two policemen heavy good natured men be take aback by the extraordinary vehemence with which their friendly advance have be reject
no offense stranger say one
it be a warn for your own good see that you be by your own show new to the place
i'm new to the place but i'm not new to you and your kind
cry mcmurdo in cold fury
i guess you're the same in all place shove your advice in when nobody ask for it
maybe we'll see more of you before very long say one of the patrolmen with a grin
you're a real hand pick one if i be a judge
i be think the same remark the other
i guess we may meet again
i'm not afraid of you and don't you think it
cry mcmurdo
my name's jack mcmurdo see
if you want me you'll find me at jacob shafter's on sheridan street vermissa so i'm not hide from you be i
day or night i dare to look the like of you in the face don't make any mistake about that
there be a murmur of sympathy and admiration from the miners at the dauntless demeanour of the newcomer while the two policemen shrug their shoulder and renew a conversation between themselves
a few minutes later the train run into the ill light station and there be a general clear for vermissa be by far the largest town on the line
mcmurdo pick up his leather gripsack and be about to start off into the darkness when one of the miners accost him
by gar mate
you know how to speak to the cop he say in a voice of awe
it be grand to hear you
let me carry your grip and show you the road
i'm pass shafter's on the way to my own shack
there be a chorus of friendly good nights from the other miners as they pass from the platform
before ever he have set foot in it mcmurdo the turbulent have become a character in vermissa
the country have be a place of terror but the town be in its way even more depress
down that long valley there be at least a certain gloomy grandeur in the huge fire and the cloud of drift smoke while the strength and industry of man find fit monuments in the hill which he have spill by the side of his monstrous excavations
but the town show a dead level of mean ugliness and squalor
the broad street be churn up by the traffic into a horrible rut paste of muddy snow
the sidewalks be narrow and uneven
the numerous gas lamps serve only to show more clearly a long line of wooden house each with its veranda face the street unkempt and dirty
as they approach the centre of the town the scene be brighten by a row of well light store and even more by a cluster of saloons and game house in which the miners spend their hard earn but generous wag
that's the union house say the guide point to one saloon which rise almost to the dignity of be a hotel
jack mcginty be the boss there
what sort of a man be he
mcmurdo ask
what
have you never hear of the boss
how could i have hear of him when you know that i be a stranger in these part
well i think his name be know clear across the country
it's be in the paper often enough
what for
well the miner lower his voice over the affairs
what affairs
good lord mister
you be queer if i must say it without offense
there's only one set of affairs that you'll hear of in these part and that's the affairs of the scowrers
why i seem to have read of the scowrers in chicago
a gang of murderers be they not
hush on your life
cry the miner stand still in alarm and gaze in amazement at his companion
man you won't live long in these part if you speak in the open street like that
many a man have have the life beat out of him for less
well i know nothing about them
it's only what i have read
and i'm not say that you have not read the truth
the man look nervously round him as he speak peer into the shadow as if he fear to see some lurk danger
if kill be murder then god know there be murder and to spare
but don't you dare to breathe the name of jack mcginty in connection with it stranger for every whisper go back to him and he be not one that be likely to let it pass
now that's the house you're after that one stand back from the street
you'll find old jacob shafter that run it as honest a man as live in this township
i thank you say mcmurdo and shake hand with his new acquaintance he plod gripsack in hand up the path which lead to the dwell house at the door of which he give a resound knock
it be open at once by someone very different from what he have expect
it be a woman young and singularly beautiful
she be of the german type blonde and fair haired with the piquant contrast of a pair of beautiful dark eye with which she survey the stranger with surprise and a please embarrassment which bring a wave of colour over her pale face
frame in the bright light of the open doorway it seem to mcmurdo that he have never see a more beautiful picture the more attractive for its contrast with the sordid and gloomy surround
a lovely violet grow upon one of those black slag heap of the mine would not have seem more surprise
so entrance be he that he stand star without a word and it be she who break the silence
i think it be father say she with a please little touch of a german accent
do you come to see him
he be downtown
i expect him back every minute
mcmurdo continue to gaze at her in open admiration until her eye drop in confusion before this masterful visitor
no miss he say at last i'm in no hurry to see him
but your house be recommend to me for board
i think it might suit me and now i know it will
you be quick to make up your mind say she with a smile
anyone but a blind man could do as much the other answer
she laugh at the compliment
come right in sir she say
i'm miss ettie shafter mr
shafter's daughter
my mother's dead and i run the house
you can sit down by the stave in the front room until father come along ah here he be
so you can fix things with him right away
a heavy elderly man come plod up the path
in a few word mcmurdo explain his business
a man of the name of murphy have give him the address in chicago
he in turn have have it from someone else
old shafter be quite ready
the stranger make no bone about term agree at once to every condition and be apparently fairly flush of money
for seven dollars a week pay in advance he be to have board and lodge
so it be that mcmurdo the self confess fugitive from justice take up his abide under the roof of the shafters the first step which be to lead to so long and dark a train of events end in a far distant land
mcmurdo be a man who make his mark quickly
wherever he be the folk around soon know it
within a week he have become infinitely the most important person at shafter's
there be ten or a dozen boarders there but they be honest foremen or commonplace clerk from the store of a very different calibre from the young irishman
of an even when they gather together his joke be always the readiest his conversation the brightest and his song the best
he be a bear boon companion with a magnetism which draw good humour from all around him
and yet he show again and again as he have show in the railway carriage a capacity for sudden fierce anger which compel the respect and even the fear of those who meet him
for the law too and all who be connect with it he exhibit a bitter contempt which delight some and alarm others of his fellow boarders
from the first he make it evident by his open admiration that the daughter of the house have win his heart from the instant that he have set eye upon her beauty and her grace
he be no backward suitor
on the second day he tell her that he love her and from then onward he repeat the same story with an absolute disregard of what she might say to discourage him
someone else
he would cry
well the worse luck for someone else
let him look out for himself
be i to lose my life's chance and all my heart's desire for someone else
you can keep on say no ettie the day will come when you will say yes and i'm young enough to wait
he be a dangerous suitor with his glib irish tongue and his pretty coax ways
there be about him also that glamour of experience and of mystery which attract a woman's interest and finally her love
he could talk of the sweet valleys of county monaghan from which he come of the lovely distant island the low hill and green meadows of which seem the more beautiful when imagination view them from this place of grime and snow
then he be verse in the life of the cities of the north of detroit and the lumber camp of michigan and finally of chicago where he have work in a plan mill
and afterwards come the hint of romance the feel that strange things have happen to him in that great city so strange and so intimate that they might not be speak of
he speak wistfully of a sudden leave a break of old tie a flight into a strange world end in this dreary valley and ettie listen her dark eye gleam with pity and with sympathy those two qualities which may turn so rapidly and so naturally to love
mcmurdo have obtain a temporary job as bookkeeper for he be a well educate man
this keep him out most of the day and he have not find occasion yet to report himself to the head of the lodge of the eminent order of freemen
he be remind of his omission however by a visit one even from mike scanlan the fellow member whom he have meet in the train
scanlan the small sharp face nervous black eye man seem glad to see him once more
after a glass or two of whisky he broach the object of his visit
say mcmurdo say he i remember your address so i make bold to call
i'm surprise that you've not report to the bodymaster
why haven't you see boss mcginty yet
well i have to find a job
i have be busy
you must find time for him if you have none for anything else
good lord man
you're a fool not to have be down to the union house and register your name the first morning after you come here
if you run against him well you mustn't that's all
mcmurdo show mild surprise
i've be a member of the lodge for over two years scanlan but i never hear that duties be so press as all that
maybe not in chicago
well it's the same society here
be it
scanlan look at him long and fixedly
there be something sinister in his eye
isn't it
you'll tell me that in a month's time
i hear you have a talk with the patrolmen after i leave the train
how do you know that
oh it get about things do get about for good and for bad in this district
well yes
i tell the hound what i think of them
by the lord you'll be a man after mcginty's heart
what do he hate the police too
scanlan burst out laugh
you go and see him my lad say he as he take his leave
it's not the police but you that he'll hate if you don't
now take a friend's advice and go at once
it chance that on the same even mcmurdo have another more press interview which urge him in the same direction
it may have be that his attentions to ettie have be more evident than before or that they have gradually obtrude themselves into the slow mind of his good german host but whatever the cause the board house keeper beckon the young man into his private room and start on the subject without any circumlocution
it seem to me mister say he that you be gettin' set on my ettie
ain't that so or be i wrong
yes that be so the young man answer
vell i vant to tell you right now that it ain't no manner of use
there's someone slip in afore you
she tell me so
vell you can lay that she tell you truth
but do she tell you who it vas
no i ask her but she wouldn't tell
i dare say not the leetle baggage
perhaps she do not vish to frighten you avay
frighten
mcmurdo be on fire in a moment
ah yes my friend
you need not be ashamed to be frighten of him
it be teddy baldwin
and who the devil be he
he be a boss of scowrers
scowrers
i've hear of them before
it's scowrers here and scowrers there and always in a whisper
what be you all afraid of
who be the scowrers
the board house keeper instinctively sink his voice as everyone do who talk about that terrible society
the scowrers say he be the eminent order of freemen
the young man star
why i be a member of that order myself
you
i vould never have have you in my house if i have know it not if you vere to pay me a hundred dollar a week
what's wrong with the order
it's for charity and good fellowship
the rule say so
maybe in some place
not here
what be it here
it's a murder society that's vat it be
mcmurdo laugh incredulously
how can you prove that
he ask
prove it
be there not fifty murder to prove it
vat about milman and van shorst and the nicholson family and old mr
hyam and little billy jam and the others
prove it
be there a man or a voman in this valley vat do not know it
see here
say mcmurdo earnestly
i want you to take back what you've say or else make it good
one or the other you must do before i quit this room
put yourself in my place
here be i a stranger in the town
i belong to a society that i know only as an innocent one
you'll find it through the length and breadth of the state but always as an innocent one
now when i be count upon join it here you tell me that it be the same as a murder society call the scowrers
i guess you owe me either an apology or else an explanation mr
shafter
i can but tell you vat the whole vorld know mister
the boss of the one be the boss of the other
if you offend the one it be the other vat vill strike you
we have prove it too often
that's just gossip i want proof
say mcmurdo
if you live here long you vill get your proof
but i forget that you be yourself one of them
you vill soon be as bad as the rest
but you vill find other lodge mister
i cannot have you here
be it not bad enough that one of these people come court my ettie and that i dare not turn him down but that i should have another for my boarder
yes indeed you shall not sleep here after to night
mcmurdo find himself under sentence of banishment both from his comfortable quarter and from the girl whom he love
he find her alone in the sit room that same even and he pour his trouble into her ear
sure your father be after give me notice he say
it's little i would care if it be just my room but indeed ettie though it's only a week that i've know you you be the very breath of life to me and i can't live without you
oh hush mr
mcmurdo don't speak so
say the girl
i have tell you have i not that you be too late
there be another and if i have not promise to marry him at once at least i can promise no one else
suppose i have be first ettie would i have have a chance
the girl sink her face into her hand
i wish to heaven that you have be first
she sob
mcmurdo be down on his knees before her in an instant
for god's sake ettie let it stand at that
he cry
will you ruin your life and my own for the sake of this promise
follow your heart acushla
'tis a safer guide than any promise before you know what it be that you be say
he have seize ettie's white hand between his own strong brown ones
say that you will be mine and we will face it out together
not here
yes here
no no jack
his arm be round her now
it could not be here
could you take me away
a struggle pass for a moment over mcmurdo's face but it end by set like granite
no here he say
i'll hold you against the world ettie right here where we be
why should we not leave together
no ettie i can't leave here
but why
i'd never hold my head up again if i felt that i have be drive out
besides what be there to be afraid of
be we not free folks in a free country
if you love me and i you who will dare to come between
you don't know jack
you've be here too short a time
you don't know this baldwin
you don't know mcginty and his scowrers
no i don't know them and i don't fear them and i don't believe in them
say mcmurdo
i've live among rough men my darling and instead of fear them it have always end that they have fear me always ettie
it's mad on the face of it
if these men as your father say have do crime after crime in the valley and if everyone know them by name how come it that none be bring to justice
you answer me that ettie
because no witness dare to appear against them
he would not live a month if he do
also because they have always their own men to swear that the accuse one be far from the scene of the crime
but surely jack you must have read all this
i have understand that every paper in the unite state be write about it
well i have read something it be true but i have think it be a story
maybe these men have some reason in what they do
maybe they be wrong and have no other way to help themselves
oh jack don't let me hear you speak so
that be how he speak the other one
baldwin he speak like that do he
and that be why i loathe him so
oh jack now i can tell you the truth
i loathe him with all my heart but i fear him also
i fear him for myself but above all i fear him for father
i know that some great sorrow would come upon us if i dare to say what i really felt
that be why i have put him off with half promise
it be in real truth our only hope
but if you would fly with me jack we could take father with us and live forever far from the power of these wicked men
again there be the struggle upon mcmurdo's face and again it set like granite
no harm shall come to you ettie nor to your father either
as to wicked men i expect you may find that i be as bad as the worst of them before we're through
no no jack
i would trust you anywhere
mcmurdo laugh bitterly
good lord
how little you know of me
your innocent soul my darling could not even guess what be pass in mine
but hullo who's the visitor
the door have open suddenly and a young fellow come swagger in with the air of one who be the master
he be a handsome dash young man of about the same age and build as mcmurdo himself
under his broad brim black felt hat which he have not trouble to remove a handsome face with fierce domineer eye and a curve hawk bill of a nose look savagely at the pair who sit by the stave
ettie have jump to her feet full of confusion and alarm
i'm glad to see you mr
baldwin say she
you're earlier than i have think
come and sit down
baldwin stand with his hand on his hips look at mcmurdo
who be this
he ask curtly
it's a friend of mine mr
baldwin a new boarder here

mcmurdo may i introduce you to mr
baldwin
the young men nod in surly fashion to each other
maybe miss ettie have tell you how it be with us
say baldwin
i didn't understand that there be any relation between you
didn't you
well you can understand it now
you can take it from me that this young lady be mine and you'll find it a very fine even for a walk
thank you i be in no humour for a walk
aren't you
the man's savage eye be blaze with anger
maybe you be in a humour for a fight mr
boarder

cry mcmurdo spring to his feet
you never say a more welcome word
for god's sake jack
oh for god's sake
cry poor distract ettie
oh jack jack he will hurt you
oh it's jack be it
say baldwin with an oath
you've come to that already have you
oh ted be reasonable be kind
for my sake ted if ever you love me be big hearted and forgive
i think ettie that if you be to leave us alone we could get this thing settle say mcmurdo quietly
or maybe mr
baldwin you will take a turn down the street with me
it's a fine even and there's some open grind beyond the next block
i'll get even with you without need to dirty my hand say his enemy
you'll wish you have never set foot in this house before i be through with you
no time like the present cry mcmurdo
i'll choose my own time mister
you can leave the time to me
see here
he suddenly roll up his sleeve and show upon his forearm a peculiar sign which appear to have be brand there
it be a circle with a triangle within it
d'you know what that mean
i neither know nor care
well you will know i'll promise you that
you won't be much older either
perhaps miss ettie can tell you something about it
as to you ettie you'll come back to me on your knees d'ye hear girl on your knees and then i'll tell you what your punishment may be
you've sow and by the lord i'll see that you reap
he glance at them both in fury
then he turn upon his heel and an instant later the outer door have bang behind him
for a few moments mcmurdo and the girl stand in silence
then she throw her arm around him
oh jack how brave you be
but it be no use you must fly
to night jack to night
it's your only hope
he will have your life
i read it in his horrible eye
what chance have you against a dozen of them with boss mcginty and all the power of the lodge behind them
mcmurdo disengage her hand kiss her and gently push her back into a chair
there acushla there
don't be disturb or fear for me
i'm a freeman myself
i'm after tell your father about it
maybe i be no better than the others so don't make a saint of me
perhaps you hate me too now that i've tell you as much
hate you jack
while life last i could never do that
i've hear that there be no harm in be a freeman anywhere but here so why should i think the worse of you for that
but if you be a freeman jack why should you not go down and make a friend of boss mcginty
oh hurry jack hurry
get your word in first or the hound will be on your trail
i be think the same thing say mcmurdo
i'll go right now and fix it
you can tell your father that i'll sleep here to night and find some other quarter in the morning
the bar of mcginty's saloon be crowd as usual for it be the favourite loaf place of all the rougher elements of the town
the man be popular for he have a rough jovial disposition which form a mask cover a great deal which lay behind it
but apart from this popularity the fear in which he be hold throughout the township and indeed down the whole thirty miles of the valley and past the mountains on each side of it be enough in itself to fill his bar for none could afford to neglect his good will
besides those secret power which it be universally believe that he exercise in so pitiless a fashion he be a high public official a municipal councillor and a commissioner of roads elect to the office through the vote of the ruffians who in turn expect to receive favour at his hand
assessments and tax be enormous the public work be notoriously neglect the account be slur over by bribe auditors and the decent citizen be terrorize into pay public blackmail and hold his tongue lest some worse thing befall him
thus it be that year by year boss mcginty's diamond pin become more obtrusive his gold chain more weighty across a more gorgeous vest and his saloon stretch farther and farther until it threaten to absorb one whole side of the market square
mcmurdo push open the swing door of the saloon and make his way amid the crowd of men within through an atmosphere blur with tobacco smoke and heavy with the smell of spirit
the place be brilliantly light and the huge heavily gild mirror upon every wall reflect and multiply the garish illumination
there be several bartenders in their shirt sleeves hard at work mix drink for the loungers who fringe the broad brass trim counter
at the far end with his body rest upon the bar and a cigar stick at an acute angle from the corner of his mouth stand a tall strong heavily build man who could be none other than the famous mcginty himself
he be a black man giant beard to the cheek bone and with a shock of raven hair which fell to his collar
his complexion be as swarthy as that of an italian and his eye be of a strange dead black which combine with a slight squint give them a particularly sinister appearance
all else in the man his noble proportion his fine feature and his frank bear fit in with that jovial man to man manner which he affect
here one would say be a bluff honest fellow whose heart would be sound however rude his outspoken word might seem
it be only when those dead dark eye deep and remorseless be turn upon a man that he shrink within himself feel that he be face to face with an infinite possibility of latent evil with a strength and courage and cunning behind it which make it a thousand time more deadly
have have a good look at his man mcmurdo elbow his way forward with his usual careless audacity and push himself through the little group of courtiers who be fawn upon the powerful boss laugh uproariously at the smallest of his joke
the young stranger's bold gray eye look back fearlessly through their glass at the deadly black ones which turn sharply upon him
well young man i can't call your face to mind
i'm new here mr
mcginty
you be not so new that you can't give a gentleman his proper title
he's councillor mcginty young man say a voice from the group
i'm sorry councillor
i'm strange to the ways of the place
but i be advise to see you
well you see me
this be all there be
what d'you think of me
well it's early days
if your heart be as big as your body and your soul as fine as your face then i'd ask for nothing better say mcmurdo
by gar
you've get an irish tongue in your head anyhow cry the saloon keeper not quite certain whether to humour this audacious visitor or to stand upon his dignity
so you be good enough to pass my appearance
sure say mcmurdo
and you be tell to see me
i be
and who tell you
brother scanlan of lodge vermissa
i drink your health councillor and to our better acquaintance
he raise a glass with which he have be serve to his lips and elevate his little finger as he drink it
mcginty who have be watch him narrowly raise his thick black eyebrows
oh it's like that be it
say he
i'll have to look a bite closer into this mister mcmurdo
a bite closer mr
mcmurdo for we don't take folk on trust in these part nor believe all we're tell neither
come in here for a moment behind the bar
there be a small room there line with barrel
mcginty carefully close the door and then seat himself on one of them bite thoughtfully on his cigar and survey his companion with those disquiet eye
for a couple of minutes he sit in complete silence
mcmurdo bore the inspection cheerfully one hand in his coat pocket the other twist his brown moustache
suddenly mcginty stoop and produce a wicked look revolver
see here my joker say he if i think you be play any game on us it would be short work for you
this be a strange welcome mcmurdo answer with some dignity for the bodymaster of a lodge of freemen to give to a stranger brother
ay but it's just that same that you have to prove say mcginty and god help you if you fail
where be you make
lodge chicago
when
june
what bodymaster
jam h
scott
who be your district ruler
bartholomew wilson
hum
you seem glib enough in your test
what be you do here
work the same as you but a poorer job
you have your back answer quick enough
yes i be always quick of speech
be you quick of action
i have have that name among those that know me best
well we may try you sooner than you think
have you hear anything of the lodge in these part
i've hear that it take a man to be a brother
true for you mr
mcmurdo
why do you leave chicago
i'm damn if i tell you that
mcginty open his eye
he be not use to be answer in such fashion and it amuse him
why won't you tell me
because no brother may tell another a lie
then the truth be too bad to tell
you can put it that way if you like
see here mister you can't expect me as bodymaster to pass into the lodge a man for whose past he can't answer
mcmurdo look puzzle
then he take a wear newspaper cut from an inner pocket
you wouldn't squeal on a fellow
say he
i'll wipe my hand across your face if you say such word to me
cry mcginty hotly
you be right councillor say mcmurdo meekly
i should apologize
i speak without think
well i know that i be safe in your hand
look at that clip
mcginty glance his eye over the account of the shoot of one jonas pinto in the lake saloon market street chicago in the new year week of
your work
he ask as he hand back the paper
mcmurdo nod
why do you shoot him
i be help uncle sam to make dollars
maybe mine be not as good gold as his but they look as well and be cheaper to make
this man pinto help me to shove the queer to do what
well it mean to pass the dollars out into circulation
then he say he would split
maybe he do split
i didn't wait to see
i just kill him and light out for the coal country
why the coal country
'cause i'd read in the paper that they weren't too particular in those part
mcginty laugh
you be first a coiner and then a murderer and you come to these part because you think you'd be welcome
that's about the size of it mcmurdo answer
well i guess you'll go far
say can you make those dollars yet
mcmurdo take half a dozen from his pocket
those never pass the philadelphia mint say he
you don't say
mcginty hold them to the light in his enormous hand which be hairy as a gorilla's
i can see no difference
gar
you'll be a mighty useful brother i'm think
we can do with a bad man or two among us friend mcmurdo for there be time when we have to take our own part
we'd soon be against the wall if we didn't shove back at those that be push us
well i guess i'll do my share of shove with the rest of the boys
you seem to have a good nerve
you didn't squirm when i shove this gun at you
it be not me that be in danger
who then
it be you councillor
mcmurdo draw a cock pistol from the side pocket of his peajacket
i be cover you all the time
i guess my shoot would have be as quick as yours
by gar
mcginty flush an angry red and then burst into a roar of laughter
say we've have no such holy terror come to hand this many a year
i reckon the lodge will learn to be proud of you well what the hell do you want
and can't i speak alone with a gentleman for five minutes but you must butt in on us
the bartender stand abash
i'm sorry councillor but it's ted baldwin
he say he must see you this very minute
the message be unnecessary for the set cruel face of the man himself be look over the servant's shoulder
he push the bartender out and close the door on him
so say he with a furious glance at mcmurdo you get here first do you
i've a word to say to you councillor about this man
then say it here and now before my face cry mcmurdo
i'll say it at my own time in my own way
tut
tut
say mcginty get off his barrel
this will never do
we have a new brother here baldwin and it's not for us to greet him in such fashion
hold out your hand man and make it up
never
cry baldwin in a fury
i've offer to fight him if he think i have wrong him say mcmurdo
i'll fight him with fists or if that won't satisfy him i'll fight him any other way he choose
now i'll leave it to you councillor to judge between us as a bodymaster should
what be it then
a young lady
she's free to choose for herself
be she
cry baldwin
as between two brothers of the lodge i should say that she be say the boss
oh that's your rule be it
yes it be ted baldwin say mcginty with a wicked stare
be it you that would dispute it
you would throw over one that have stand by you this five years in favour of a man that you never saw before in your life
you're not bodymaster for life jack mcginty and by god
when next it come to a vote the councillor spring at him like a tiger
his hand close round the other's neck and he hurl him back across one of the barrel
in his mad fury he would have squeeze the life out of him if mcmurdo have not interfere
easy councillor
for heaven's sake go easy
he cry as he drag him back
mcginty release his hold and baldwin cow and shake gasp for breath and shiver in every limb as one who have look over the very edge of death sit up on the barrel over which he have be hurl
you've be ask for it this many a day ted baldwin now you've get it
cry mcginty his huge chest rise and fall
maybe you think if i be vote down from bodymaster you would find yourself in my shoe
it's for the lodge to say that
but so long as i be the chief i'll have no man lift his voice against me or my rule
i have nothing against you mumble baldwin feel his throat
well then cry the other relapse in a moment into a bluff joviality we be all good friends again and there's an end of the matter
he take a bottle of champagne down from the shelf and twist out the cork
see now he continue as he fill three high glass
let us drink the quarrel toast of the lodge
after that as you know there can be no bad blood between us
now then the leave hand on the apple of my throat
i say to you ted baldwin what be the offense sir
the cloud be heavy answer baldwin but they will forever brighten
and this i swear
the men drink their glass and the same ceremony be perform between baldwin and mcmurdo
there
cry mcginty rub his hand
that's the end of the black blood
you come under lodge discipline if it go further and that's a heavy hand in these part as brother baldwin know and as you will damn soon find out brother mcmurdo if you ask for trouble
faith i'd be slow to do that say mcmurdo
he hold out his hand to baldwin
i'm quick to quarrel and quick to forgive
it's my hot irish blood they tell me
but it's over for me and i bear no grudge
baldwin have to take the proffer hand for the baleful eye of the terrible boss be upon him
but his sullen face show how little the word of the other have move him
mcginty clap them both on the shoulder
tut
these girls
these girls
he cry
to think that the same petticoats should come between two of my boys
it's the devil's own luck
well it's the colleen inside of them that must settle the question for it's outside the jurisdiction of a bodymaster and the lord be praise for that
we have enough on us without the women as well
you'll have to be affiliate to lodge brother mcmurdo
we have our own ways and methods different from chicago
saturday night be our meet and if you come then we'll make you free forever of the vermissa valley
on the day follow the even which have contain so many excite events mcmurdo move his lodge from old jacob shafter's and take up his quarter at the widow macnamara's on the extreme outskirts of the town
scanlan his original acquaintance aboard the train have occasion shortly afterwards to move into vermissa and the two lodge together
there be no other boarder and the host be an easy go old irishwoman who leave them to themselves so that they have a freedom for speech and action welcome to men who have secrets in common
shafter have relent to the extent of let mcmurdo come to his meals there when he like so that his intercourse with ettie be by no mean break
on the contrary it draw closer and more intimate as the weeks go by
in his bedroom at his new abide mcmurdo felt it safe to take out the coin mould and under many a pledge of secrecy a number of brothers from the lodge be allow to come in and see them each carry away in his pocket some examples of the false money so cunningly strike that there be never the slightest difficulty or danger in pass it
why with such a wonderful art at his command mcmurdo should condescend to work at all be a perpetual mystery to his companion though he make it clear to anyone who ask him that if he live without any visible mean it would very quickly bring the police upon his track
one policeman be indeed after him already but the incident as luck would have it do the adventurer a great deal more good than harm
after the first introduction there be few even when he do not find his way to mcginty's saloon there to make closer acquaintance with the boys which be the jovial title by which the dangerous gang who infest the place be know to one another
his dash manner and fearlessness of speech make him a favourite with them all while the rapid and scientific way in which he polish off his antagonist in an all in bar room scrap earn the respect of that rough community
another incident however raise him even higher in their estimation
just at the crowd hour one night the door open and a man enter with the quiet blue uniform and peak cap of the mine police
this be a special body raise by the railways and colliery owners to supplement the efforts of the ordinary civil police who be perfectly helpless in the face of the organize ruffianism which terrorize the district
there be a hush as he enter and many a curious glance be cast at him but the relations between policemen and criminals be peculiar in some part of the state and mcginty himself stand behind his counter show no surprise when the policeman enrol himself among his customers
a straight whisky for the night be bitter say the police officer
i don't think we have meet before councillor
you'll be the new captain
say mcginty
that's so
we're look to you councillor and to the other lead citizens to help us in uphold law and order in this township
captain marvin be my name
we'd do better without you captain marvin say mcginty coldly for we have our own police of the township and no need for any import goods
what be you but the pay tool of the capitalists hire by them to club or shoot your poorer fellow citizen
well well we won't argue about that say the police officer good humouredly
i expect we all do our duty same as we see it but we can't all see it the same
he have drink off his glass and have turn to go when his eye fell upon the face of jack mcmurdo who be scowl at his elbow
hullo
hullo
he cry look him up and down
here's an old acquaintance
mcmurdo shrink away from him
i be never a friend to you nor any other curse copper in my life say he
an acquaintance isn't always a friend say the police captain grin
you're jack mcmurdo of chicago right enough and don't you deny it
mcmurdo shrug his shoulder
i'm not deny it say he
d'ye think i'm ashamed of my own name
you've get good cause to be anyhow
what the devil d'you mean by that
he roar with his fists clench
no no jack bluster won't do with me
i be an officer in chicago before ever i come to this darn coal bunker and i know a chicago crook when i see one
mcmurdo's face fell
don't tell me that you're marvin of the chicago central
he cry
just the same old teddy marvin at your service
we haven't forget the shoot of jonas pinto up there
i never shoot him
do you not
that's good impartial evidence ain't it
well his death come in uncommon handy for you or they would have have you for shove the queer
well we can let that be bygones for between you and me and perhaps i'm go further than my duty in say it they could get no clear case against you and chicago's open to you to morrow
i'm very well where i be
well i've give you the pointer and you're a sulky dog not to thank me for it
well i suppose you mean well and i do thank you say mcmurdo in no very gracious manner
it's mum with me so long as i see you live on the straight say the captain
but by the lord
if you get off after this it's another story
so good night to you and goodnight councillor
he leave the bar room but not before he have create a local hero
mcmurdo's deeds in far chicago have be whisper before
he have put off all question with a smile as one who do not wish to have greatness thrust upon him
but now the thing be officially confirm
the bar loafers crowd round him and shake him heartily by the hand
he be free of the community from that time on
he could drink hard and show little trace of it but that even have his mate scanlan not be at hand to lead him home the fete hero would surely have spend his night under the bar
on a saturday night mcmurdo be introduce to the lodge
he have think to pass in without ceremony as be an initiate of chicago but there be particular rites in vermissa of which they be proud and these have to be undergo by every postulant
the assembly meet in a large room reserve for such purpose at the union house
some sixty members assemble at vermissa but that by no mean represent the full strength of the organization for there be several other lodge in the valley and others across the mountains on each side who exchange members when any serious business be afoot so that a crime might be do by men who be strangers to the locality
altogether there be not less than five hundred scatter over the coal district
in the bare assembly room the men be gather round a long table
at the side be a second one lade with bottle and glass on which some members of the company be already turn their eye
mcginty sit at the head with a flat black velvet cap upon his shock of tangle black hair and a colour purple steal round his neck so that he seem to be a priest preside over some diabolical ritual
to right and leave of him be the higher lodge officials the cruel handsome face of ted baldwin among them
each of these wear some scarf or medallion as emblem of his office
they be for the most part men of mature age but the rest of the company consist of young fellows from eighteen to twenty five the ready and capable agents who carry out the command of their seniors
among the older men be many whose feature show the tigerish lawless souls within but look at the rank and file it be difficult to believe that these eager and open face young fellows be in very truth a dangerous gang of murderers whose mind have suffer such complete moral perversion that they take a horrible pride in their proficiency at the business and look with deepest respect at the man who have the reputation of make what they call a clean job
to their contort natures it have become a spirit and chivalrous thing to volunteer for service against some man who have never injure them and whom in many case they have never see in their live
the crime commit they quarrel as to who have actually strike the fatal blow and amuse one another and the company by describe the cry and contortions of the murder man
at first they have show some secrecy in their arrangements but at the time which this narrative describe their proceed be extraordinarily open for the repeat failures of the law have prove to them that on the one hand no one would dare to witness against them and on the other they have an unlimited number of stanch witness upon whom they could call and a well fill treasure chest from which they could draw the fund to engage the best legal talent in the state
in ten long years of outrage there have be no single conviction and the only danger that ever threaten the scowrers lay in the victim himself who however outnumber and take by surprise might and occasionally do leave his mark upon his assailants
mcmurdo have be warn that some ordeal lay before him but no one would tell him in what it consist
he be lead now into an outer room by two solemn brothers
through the plank partition he could hear the murmur of many voice from the assembly within
once or twice he catch the sound of his own name and he know that they be discuss his candidacy
then there enter an inner guard with a green and gold sash across his chest
the bodymaster order that he shall be truss blind and enter say he
the three of them remove his coat turn up the sleeve of his right arm and finally pass a rope round above the elbow and make it fast
they next place a thick black cap right over his head and the upper part of his face so that he could see nothing
he be then lead into the assembly hall
it be pitch dark and very oppressive under his hood
he hear the rustle and murmur of the people round him and then the voice of mcginty sound dull and distant through the cover of his ears
john mcmurdo say the voice be you already a member of the ancient order of freemen
he bow in assent
be your lodge no
chicago
he bow again
dark nights be unpleasant say the voice
yes for strangers to travel he answer
the cloud be heavy
yes a storm be approach
be the brethren satisfy
ask the bodymaster
there be a general murmur of assent
we know brother by your sign and by your countersign that you be indeed one of us say mcginty
we would have you know however that in this county and in other counties of these part we have certain rites and also certain duties of our own which call for good men
be you ready to be test
i be
be you of stout heart
i be
take a stride forward to prove it
as the word be say he felt two hard point in front of his eye press upon them so that it appear as if he could not move forward without a danger of lose them
none the less he nerve himself to step resolutely out and as he do so the pressure melt away
there be a low murmur of applause
he be of stout heart say the voice
can you bear pain
as well as another he answer
test him
it be all he could do to keep himself from scream out for an agonize pain shoot through his forearm
he nearly faint at the sudden shock of it but he bite his lip and clench his hand to hide his agony
i can take more than that say he
this time there be loud applause
a finer first appearance have never be make in the lodge
hand clap him on the back and the hood be pluck from his head
he stand blink and smile amid the congratulations of the brothers
one last word brother mcmurdo say mcginty
you have already swear the oath of secrecy and fidelity and you be aware that the punishment for any breach of it be instant and inevitable death
i be say mcmurdo
and you accept the rule of the bodymaster for the time be under all circumstances
i do
then in the name of lodge vermissa i welcome you to its privilege and debate
you will put the liquor on the table brother scanlan and we will drink to our worthy brother
mcmurdo's coat have be bring to him but before put it on he examine his right arm which still smart heavily
there on the flesh of the forearm be a circle with a triangle within it deep and red as the brand iron have leave it
one or two of his neighbour pull up their sleeves and show their own lodge mark
we've all have it say one but not all as brave as you over it
tut
it be nothing say he but it burn and ache all the same
when the drink which follow the ceremony of initiation have all be dispose of the business of the lodge proceed
mcmurdo accustom only to the prosaic performances of chicago listen with open ears and more surprise than he venture to show to what follow
the first business on the agenda paper say mcginty be to read the follow letter from division master windle of merton county lodge
he say dear sir there be a job to be do on andrew rae of rae sturmash coal owners near this place
you will remember that your lodge owe us a return have have the service of two brethren in the matter of the patrolman last fall
you will send two good men they will be take charge of by treasurer higgins of this lodge whose address you know
he will show them when to act and where
yours in freedom j w windle d m a o f
windle have never refuse us when we have have occasion to ask for the loan of a man or two and it be not for us to refuse him
mcginty pause and look round the room with his dull malevolent eye
who will volunteer for the job
several young fellows hold up their hand
the bodymaster look at them with an approve smile
you'll do tiger cormac
if you handle it as well as you do the last you won't be wrong
and you wilson
i've no pistol say the volunteer a mere boy in his teens
it's your first be it not
well you have to be blood some time
it will be a great start for you
as to the pistol you'll find it wait for you or i'm mistake
if you report yourselves on monday it will be time enough
you'll get a great welcome when you return
any reward this time
ask cormac a thick set dark face brutal look young man whose ferocity have earn him the nickname of tiger
never mind the reward
you just do it for the honour of the thing
maybe when it be do there will be a few odd dollars at the bottom of the box
what have the man do
ask young wilson
sure it's not for the like of you to ask what the man have do
he have be judge over there
that's no business of ours
all we have to do be to carry it out for them same as they would for us
speak of that two brothers from the merton lodge be come over to us next week to do some business in this quarter
who be they
ask someone
faith it be wiser not to ask
if you know nothing you can testify nothing and no trouble can come of it
but they be men who will make a clean job when they be about it
and time too
cry ted baldwin
folk be gettin' out of hand in these part
it be only last week that three of our men be turn off by foreman blaker
it's be owe him a long time and he'll get it full and proper
get what
mcmurdo whisper to his neighbour
the business end of a buckshot cartridge
cry the man with a loud laugh
what think you of our ways brother
mcmurdo's criminal soul seem to have already absorb the spirit of the vile association of which he be now a member
i like it well say he
'tis a proper place for a lad of mettle
several of those who sit around hear his word and applaud them
what's that
cry the black man bodymaster from the end of the table
'tis our new brother sir who find our ways to his taste
mcmurdo rise to his feet for an instant
i would say eminent bodymaster that if a man should be want i should take it as an honour to be choose to help the lodge
there be great applause at this
it be felt that a new sun be push its rim above the horizon
to some of the elders it seem that the progress be a little too rapid
i would move say the secretary harraway a vulture face old graybeard who sit near the chairman that brother mcmurdo should wait until it be the good pleasure of the lodge to employ him
sure that be what i mean i'm in your hand say mcmurdo
your time will come brother say the chairman
we have mark you down as a will man and we believe that you will do good work in these part
there be a small matter to night in which you may take a hand if it so please you
i will wait for something that be worth while
you can come to night anyhow and it will help you to know what we stand for in this community
i will make the announcement later
meanwhile he glance at his agenda paper i have one or two more point to bring before the meet
first of all i will ask the treasurer as to our bank balance
there be the pension to jim carnaway's widow
he be strike down do the work of the lodge and it be for us to see that she be not the loser
jim be shoot last month when they try to kill chester wilcox of marley creek mcmurdo's neighbour inform him
the fund be good at the moment say the treasurer with the bankbook in front of him
the firm have be generous of late
max linder co
pay five hundred to be leave alone
walker brothers send in a hundred but i take it on myself to return it and ask for five
if i do not hear by wednesday their wind gear may get out of order
we have to burn their breaker last year before they become reasonable
then the west section coal company have pay its annual contribution
we have enough on hand to meet any obligations
what about archie swindon
ask a brother
he have sell out and leave the district
the old devil leave a note for us to say that he have rather be a free cross sweeper in new york than a large mine owner under the power of a ring of blackmailers
by gar
it be as well that he make a break for it before the note reach us
i guess he won't show his face in this valley again
an elderly clean shave man with a kindly face and a good brow rise from the end of the table which face the chairman
mr
treasurer he ask may i ask who have buy the property of this man that we have drive out of the district
yes brother morris
it have be buy by the state merton county railroad company
and who buy the mine of todman and of lee that come into the market in the same way last year
the same company brother morris
and who buy the ironworks of manson and of shuman and of van deher and of atwood which have all be give up of late
they be all buy by the west gilmerton general mine company
i don't see brother morris say the chairman that it matter to us who buy them since they can't carry them out of the district
with all respect to you eminent bodymaster i think it may matter very much to us
this process have be go on now for ten long years
we be gradually drive all the small men out of trade
what be the result
we find in their place great company like the railroad or the general iron who have their directors in new york or philadelphia and care nothing for our threats
we can take it out of their local boss but it only mean that others will be send in their stead
and we be make it dangerous for ourselves
the small men could not harm us
they have not the money nor the power
so long as we do not squeeze them too dry they would stay on under our power
but if these big company find that we stand between them and their profit they will spare no pain and no expense to hunt us down and bring us to court
there be a hush at these ominous word and every face darken as gloomy look be exchange
so omnipotent and unchallenged have they be that the very think that there be possible retribution in the background have be banish from their mind
and yet the idea strike a chill to the most reckless of them
it be my advice the speaker continue that we go easier upon the small men
on the day that they have all be drive out the power of this society will have be break
unwelcome truths be not popular
there be angry cry as the speaker resume his seat
mcginty rise with gloom upon his brow
brother morris say he you be always a croaker
so long as the members of this lodge stand together there be no power in the unite state that can touch them
sure have we not try it often enough in the law court
i expect the big company will find it easier to pay than to fight same as the little company do
and now brethren mcginty take off his black velvet cap and his steal as he speak this lodge have finish its business for the even save for one small matter which may be mention when we be part
the time have now come for fraternal refreshment and for harmony
strange indeed be human nature
here be these men to whom murder be familiar who again and again have strike down the father of the family some man against whom they have no personal feel without one think of compunction or of compassion for his weep wife or helpless children and yet the tender or pathetic in music could move them to tear
mcmurdo have a fine tenor voice and if he have fail to gain the good will of the lodge before it could no longer have be withhold after he have thrill them with i'm sit on the stile mary and on the bank of allan water
in his very first night the new recruit have make himself one of the most popular of the brethren mark already for advancement and high office
there be other qualities need however besides those of good fellowship to make a worthy freeman and of these he be give an example before the even be over
the whisky bottle have pass round many time and the men be flush and ripe for mischief when their bodymaster rise once more to address them
boys say he there's one man in this town that want trim up and it's for you to see that he get it
i'm speak of jam stanger of the herald
you've see how he's be open his mouth against us again
there be a murmur of assent with many a mutter oath
mcginty take a slip of paper from his waistcoat pocket
law and order
that's how he head it
reign of terror in the coal and iron district twelve years have now elapse since the first assassinations which prove the existence of a criminal organization in our midst
from that day these outrage have never cease until now they have reach a pitch which make us the opprobrium of the civilize world
be it for such result as this that our great country welcome to its bosom the alien who fly from the despotisms of europe
be it that they shall themselves become tyrants over the very men who have give them shelter and that a state of terrorism and lawlessness should be establish under the very shadow of the sacred fold of the starry flag of freedom which would raise horror in our mind if we read of it as exist under the most effete monarchy of the east
the men be know
the organization be patent and public
how long be we to endure it
can we forever live sure i've read enough of the slush
cry the chairman toss the paper down upon the table
that's what he say of us
the question i'm ask you be what shall we say to him
kill him
cry a dozen fierce voice
i protest against that say brother morris the man of the good brow and shave face
i tell you brethren that our hand be too heavy in this valley and that there will come a point where in self defense every man will unite to crush us out
jam stanger be an old man
he be respect in the township and the district
his paper stand for all that be solid in the valley
if that man be strike down there will be a stir through this state that will only end with our destruction
and how would they bring about our destruction mr
standback
cry mcginty
be it by the police
sure half of them be in our pay and half of them afraid of us
or be it by the law court and the judge
haven't we try that before now and what ever come of it
there be a judge lynch that might try the case say brother morris
a general shout of anger greet the suggestion
i have but to raise my finger cry mcginty and i could put two hundred men into this town that would clear it out from end to end
then suddenly raise his voice and bend his huge black brows into a terrible frown see here brother morris i have my eye on you and have have for some time
you've no heart yourself and you try to take the heart out of others
it will be an ill day for you brother morris when your own name come on our agenda paper and i'm think that it's just there that i ought to place it
morris have turn deadly pale and his knees seem to give way under him as he fell back into his chair
he raise his glass in his tremble hand and drink before he could answer
i apologize eminent bodymaster to you and to every brother in this lodge if i have say more than i should
i be a faithful member you all know that and it be my fear lest evil come to the lodge which make me speak in anxious word
but i have greater trust in your judgment than in my own eminent bodymaster and i promise you that i will not offend again
the bodymaster's scowl relax as he listen to the humble word
very good brother morris
it's myself that would be sorry if it be needful to give you a lesson
but so long as i be in this chair we shall be a unite lodge in word and in deed
and now boys he continue look round at the company i'll say this much that if stanger get his full desert there would be more trouble than we need ask for
these editors hang together and every journal in the state would be cry out for police and troop
but i guess you can give him a pretty severe warn
will you fix it brother baldwin
sure
say the young man eagerly
how many will you take
half a dozen and two to guard the door
you'll come gower and you mansel and you scanlan and the two willabys
i promise the new brother he should go say the chairman
ted baldwin look at mcmurdo with eye which show that he have not forget nor forgive
well he can come if he want he say in a surly voice
that's enough
the sooner we get to work the better
the company break up with shout and yell and snatch of drunken song
the bar be still crowd with revellers and many of the brethren remain there
the little band who have be tell off for duty pass out into the street proceed in twos and threes along the sidewalk so as not to provoke attention
it be a bitterly cold night with a half moon shin brilliantly in a frosty star spangle sky
the men stop and gather in a yard which face a high build
the word vermissa herald be print in gold letter between the brightly light windows
from within come the clank of the print press
here you say baldwin to mcmurdo you can stand below at the door and see that the road be keep open for us
arthur willaby can stay with you
you others come with me
have no fear boys for we have a dozen witness that we be in the union bar at this very moment
it be nearly midnight and the street be desert save for one or two revellers upon their way home
the party cross the road and push open the door of the newspaper office baldwin and his men rush in and up the stair which face them
mcmurdo and another remain below
from the room above come a shout a cry for help and then the sound of trample feet and of fall chair
an instant later a gray haired man rush out on the land
he be seize before he could get farther and his spectacles come tinkle down to mcmurdo's feet
there be a thud and a groan
he be on his face and half a dozen stick be clatter together as they fell upon him
he writhe and his long thin limbs quiver under the blow
the others cease at last but baldwin his cruel face set in an infernal smile be hack at the man's head which he vainly endeavour to defend with his arm
his white hair be dabble with patch of blood
baldwin be still stoop over his victim put in a short vicious blow whenever he could see a part expose when mcmurdo dash up the stair and push him back
you'll kill the man say he
drop it
baldwin look at him in amazement
curse you
he cry
who be you to interfere you that be new to the lodge
stand back
he raise his stick but mcmurdo have whip his pistol out of his hip pocket
stand back yourself
he cry
i'll blow your face in if you lay a hand on me
as to the lodge wasn't it the order of the bodymaster that the man be not to be kill and what be you do but kill him
it's truth he say remark one of the men
by gar
you'd best hurry yourselves
cry the man below
the windows be all light up and you'll have the whole town here inside of five minutes
there be indeed the sound of shout in the street and a little group of compositors and pressmen be form in the hall below and nerve itself to action
leave the limp and motionless body of the editor at the head of the stair the criminals rush down and make their way swiftly along the street
have reach the union house some of them mix with the crowd in mcginty's saloon whisper across the bar to the boss that the job have be well carry through
others and among them mcmurdo break away into side streets and so by devious paths to their own home
when mcmurdo awake next morning he have good reason to remember his initiation into the lodge
his head ache with the effect of the drink and his arm where he have be brand be hot and swell
have his own peculiar source of income he be irregular in his attendance at his work so he have a late breakfast and remain at home for the morning write a long letter to a friend
afterwards he read the daily herald
in a special column put in at the last moment he read outrage at the herald office editor seriously injure
it be a short account of the facts with which he be himself more familiar than the writer could have be
it end with the statement the matter be now in the hand of the police but it can hardly be hop that their exertions will be attend by any better result than in the past
some of the men be recognize and there be hope that a conviction may be obtain
the source of the outrage be it need hardly be say that infamous society which have hold this community in bondage for so long a period and against which the herald have take so uncompromising a stand
mr
stanger's many friends will rejoice to hear that though he have be cruelly and brutally beat and though he have sustain severe injuries about the head there be no immediate danger to his life
below it state that a guard of police arm with winchester rifle have be requisition for the defense of the office
mcmurdo have lay down the paper and be light his pipe with a hand which be shaky from the excesses of the previous even when there be a knock outside and his landlady bring to him a note which have just be hand in by a lad
it be unsigned and run thus i should wish to speak to you but would rather not do so in your house
you will find me beside the flagstaff upon miller hill
if you will come there now i have something which it be important for you to hear and for me to say
mcmurdo read the note twice with the utmost surprise for he could not imagine what it mean or who be the author of it
have it be in a feminine hand he might have imagine that it be the begin of one of those adventure which have be familiar enough in his past life
but it be the write of a man and of a well educate one too
finally after some hesitation he determine to see the matter through
miller hill be an ill keep public park in the very centre of the town
in summer it be a favourite resort of the people but in winter it be desolate enough
from the top of it one have a view not only of the whole straggle grimy town but of the wind valley beneath with its scatter mine and factories blacken the snow on each side of it and of the wooded and white cap range flank it
mcmurdo stroll up the wind path hedge in with evergreens until he reach the desert restaurant which form the centre of summer gaiety
beside it be a bare flagstaff and underneath it a man his hat draw down and the collar of his overcoat turn up
when he turn his face mcmurdo saw that it be brother morris he who have incur the anger of the bodymaster the night before
the lodge sign be give and exchange as they meet
i want to have a word with you mr
mcmurdo say the older man speak with a hesitation which show that he be on delicate grind
it be kind of you to come
why do you not put your name to the note
one have to be cautious mister
one never know in time like these how a thing may come back to one
one never know either who to trust or who not to trust
surely one may trust brothers of the lodge
no no not always cry morris with vehemence
whatever we say even what we think seem to go back to that man mcginty
look here
say mcmurdo sternly
it be only last night as you know well that i swear good faith to our bodymaster
would you be ask me to break my oath
if that be the view you take say morris sadly i can only say that i be sorry i give you the trouble to come and meet me
things have come to a bad pass when two free citizens cannot speak their thoughts to each other
mcmurdo who have be watch his companion very narrowly relax somewhat in his bear
sure i speak for myself only say he
i be a newcomer as you know and i be strange to it all
it be not for me to open my mouth mr
morris and if you think well to say anything to me i be here to hear it
and to take it back to boss mcginty
say morris bitterly
indeed then you do me injustice there cry mcmurdo
for myself i be loyal to the lodge and so i tell you straight but i would be a poor creature if i be to repeat to any other what you might say to me in confidence
it will go no further than me though i warn you that you may get neither help nor sympathy
i have give up look for either the one or the other say morris
i may be put my very life in your hand by what i say but bad as you be and it seem to me last night that you be shape to be as bad as the worst still you be new to it and your conscience cannot yet be as harden as theirs
that be why i think to speak with you
well what have you to say
if you give me away may a curse be on you
sure i say i would not
i would ask you then when you join the freeman's society in chicago and swear vow of charity and fidelity do ever it cross your mind that you might find it would lead you to crime
if you call it crime mcmurdo answer
call it crime
cry morris his voice vibrate with passion
you have see little of it if you can call it anything else
be it crime last night when a man old enough to be your father be beat till the blood drip from his white hairs
be that crime or what else would you call it
there be some would say it be war say mcmurdo a war of two class with all in so that each strike as best it could
well do you think of such a thing when you join the freeman's society at chicago
no i'm bind to say i do not
nor do i when i join it at philadelphia
it be just a benefit club and a meet place for one's fellows
then i hear of this place curse the hour that the name first fell upon my ears and i come to better myself
my god
to better myself
my wife and three children come with me
i start a dry goods store on market square and i prosper well
the word have go round that i be a freeman and i be force to join the local lodge same as you do last night
i've the badge of shame on my forearm and something worse brand on my heart
i find that i be under the order of a black villain and catch in a meshwork of crime
what could i do
every word i say to make things better be take as treason same as it be last night
i can't get away for all i have in the world be in my store
if i leave the society i know well that it mean murder to me and god know what to my wife and children
oh man it be awful awful
he put his hand to his face and his body shake with convulsive sob
mcmurdo shrug his shoulder
you be too soft for the job say he
you be the wrong sort for such work
i have a conscience and a religion but they make me a criminal among them
i be choose for a job
if i back down i know well what would come to me
maybe i'm a coward
maybe it's the think of my poor little woman and the children that make me one
anyhow i go
i guess it will haunt me forever
it be a lonely house twenty miles from here over the range yonder
i be tell off for the door same as you be last night
they could not trust me with the job
the others go in
when they come out their hand be crimson to the wrists
as we turn away a child be scream out of the house behind us
it be a boy of five who have see his father murder
i nearly faint with the horror of it and yet i have to keep a bold and smile face for well i know that if i do not it would be out of my house that they would come next with their bloody hand and it would be my little fred that would be scream for his father
but i be a criminal then part sharer in a murder lose forever in this world and lose also in the next
i be a good catholic but the priest would have no word with me when he hear i be a scowrer and i be excommunicate from my faith
that's how it stand with me
and i see you go down the same road and i ask you what the end be to be
be you ready to be a cold blood murderer also or can we do anything to stop it
what would you do
ask mcmurdo abruptly
you would not inform
god forbid
cry morris
sure the very think would cost me my life
that's well say mcmurdo
i'm think that you be a weak man and that you make too much of the matter
too much
wait till you have live here longer
look down the valley
see the cloud of a hundred chimneys that overshadow it
i tell you that the cloud of murder hang thicker and lower than that over the head of the people
it be the valley of fear the valley of death
the terror be in the hearts of the people from the dusk to the dawn
wait young man and you will learn for yourself
well i'll let you know what i think when i have see more say mcmurdo carelessly
what be very clear be that you be not the man for the place and that the sooner you sell out if you only get a dime a dollar for what the business be worth the better it will be for you
what you have say be safe with me but by gar
if i think you be an informer no no
cry morris piteously
well let it rest at that
i'll bear what you have say in mind and maybe some day i'll come back to it
i expect you mean kindly by speak to me like this
now i'll be get home
one word before you go say morris
we may have be see together
they may want to know what we have speak about
ah
that's well think of
i offer you a clerkship in my store
and i refuse it
that's our business
well so long brother morris and may you find things go better with you in the future
that same afternoon as mcmurdo sit smoke lose in think beside the stave of his sit room the door swing open and its framework be fill with the huge figure of boss mcginty
he pass the sign and then seat himself opposite to the young man he look at him steadily for some time a look which be as steadily return
i'm not much of a visitor brother mcmurdo he say at last
i guess i be too busy over the folk that visit me
but i think i'd stretch a point and drop down to see you in your own house
i'm proud to see you here councillor mcmurdo answer heartily bring his whisky bottle out of the cupboard
it's an honour that i have not expect
how's the arm
ask the boss
mcmurdo make a wry face
well i'm not forget it he say but it's worth it
yes it's worth it the other answer to those that be loyal and go through with it and be a help to the lodge
what be you speak to brother morris about on miller hill this morning
the question come so suddenly that it be well that he have his answer prepare
he burst into a hearty laugh
morris didn't know i could earn a live here at home
he shan't know either for he have get too much conscience for the like of me
but he's a good hearted old chap
it be his idea that i be at a loose end and that he would do me a good turn by offer me a clerkship in a dry goods store
oh that be it
yes that be it
and you refuse it
sure
couldn't i earn ten time as much in my own bedroom with four hours' work
that's so
but i wouldn't get about too much with morris
why not
well i guess because i tell you not
that's enough for most folk in these part
it may be enough for most folk but it ain't enough for me councillor say mcmurdo boldly
if you be a judge of men you'll know that
the swarthy giant glare at him and his hairy paw close for an instant round the glass as though he would hurl it at the head of his companion
then he laugh in his loud boisterous insincere fashion
you're a queer card for sure say he
well if you want reason i'll give them
do morris say nothing to you against the lodge
no
nor against me
no
well that's because he daren't trust you
but in his heart he be not a loyal brother
we know that well
so we watch him and we wait for the time to admonish him
i'm think that the time be draw near
there's no room for scabby sheep in our pen
but if you keep company with a disloyal man we might think that you be disloyal too
see
there's no chance of my keep company with him for i dislike the man mcmurdo answer
as to be disloyal if it be any man but you he would not use the word to me twice
well that's enough say mcginty drain off his glass
i come down to give you a word in season and you've have it
i'd like to know say mcmurdo how you ever come to learn that i have speak with morris at all
mcginty laugh
it's my business to know what go on in this township say he
i guess you'd best reckon on my hear all that pass
well time's up and i'll just say but his leavetaking be cut short in a very unexpected fashion
with a sudden crash the door fly open and three frown intent face glare in at them from under the peak of police cap
mcmurdo spring to his feet and half draw his revolver but his arm stop midway as he become conscious that two winchester rifle be level at his head
a man in uniform advance into the room a six shooter in his hand
it be captain marvin once of chicago and now of the mine constabulary
he shake his head with a half smile at mcmurdo
i think you'd be get into trouble mr
crook mcmurdo of chicago say he
can't keep out of it can you
take your hat and come along with us
i guess you'll pay for this captain marvin say mcginty
who be you i'd like to know to break into a house in this fashion and molest honest law abide men
you're stand out in this deal councillor mcginty say the police captain
we be not out after you but after this man mcmurdo
it be for you to help not to hinder us in our duty
he be a friend of mine and i'll answer for his conduct say the boss
by all account mr
mcginty you may have to answer for your own conduct some of these days the captain answer
this man mcmurdo be a crook before ever he come here and he's a crook still
cover him patrolman while i disarm him
there's my pistol say mcmurdo coolly
maybe captain marvin if you and i be alone and face to face you would not take me so easily
where's your warrant
ask mcginty
by gar
a man might as well live in russia as in vermissa while folk like you be run the police
it's a capitalist outrage and you'll hear more of it i reckon
you do what you think be your duty the best way you can councillor
we'll look after ours
what be i accuse of
ask mcmurdo
of be concern in the beat of old editor stanger at the herald office
it wasn't your fault that it isn't a murder charge
well if that's all you have against him cry mcginty with a laugh you can save yourself a deal of trouble by drop it right now
this man be with me in my saloon play poker up to midnight and i can bring a dozen to prove it
that's your affair and i guess you can settle it in court to morrow
meanwhile come on mcmurdo and come quietly if you don't want a gun across your head
you stand wide mr
mcginty for i warn you i will stand no resistance when i be on duty
so determine be the appearance of the captain that both mcmurdo and his boss be force to accept the situation
the latter manage to have a few whisper word with the prisoner before they part
what about he jerk his thumb upward to signify the coin plant
all right whisper mcmurdo who have devise a safe hide place under the floor
i'll bid you good bye say the boss shake hand
i'll see reilly the lawyer and take the defense upon myself
take my word for it that they won't be able to hold you
i wouldn't bet on that
guard the prisoner you two and shoot him if he try any game
i'll search the house before i leave
he do so but apparently find no trace of the conceal plant
when he have descend he and his men escort mcmurdo to headquarter
darkness have fall and a keen blizzard be blow so that the streets be nearly desert but a few loiterers follow the group and embolden by invisibility shout imprecations at the prisoner
lynch the curse scowrer
they cry
lynch him
they laugh and jeer as he be push into the police station
after a short formal examination from the inspector in charge he be put into the common cell
here he find baldwin and three other criminals of the night before all arrest that afternoon and wait their trial next morning
but even within this inner fortress of the law the long arm of the freemen be able to extend
late at night there come a jailer with a straw bundle for their bed out of which he extract two bottle of whisky some glass and a pack of card
they spend a hilarious night without an anxious think as to the ordeal of the morning
nor have they cause as the result be to show
the magistrate could not possibly on the evidence have hold them for a higher court
on the one hand the compositors and pressmen be force to admit that the light be uncertain that they be themselves much perturb and that it be difficult for them to swear to the identity of the assailants although they believe that the accuse be among them
cross examine by the clever attorney who have be engage by mcginty they be even more nebulous in their evidence
the injure man have already depose that he be so take by surprise by the suddenness of the attack that he could state nothing beyond the fact that the first man who strike him wear a moustache
he add that he know them to be scowrers since no one else in the community could possibly have any enmity to him and he have long be threaten on account of his outspoken editorials
on the other hand it be clearly show by the unite and unfaltering evidence of six citizens include that high municipal official councillor mcginty that the men have be at a card party at the union house until an hour very much later than the commission of the outrage
needle to say that they be discharge with something very near to an apology from the bench for the inconvenience to which they have be put together with an imply censure of captain marvin and the police for their officious zeal
the verdict be greet with loud applause by a court in which mcmurdo saw many familiar face
brothers of the lodge smile and wave
but there be others who sit with compress lips and brood eye as the men file out of the dock
one of them a little dark beard resolute fellow put the thoughts of himself and comrades into word as the ex prisoners pass him
you damn murderers
he say
we'll fix you yet
if anything have be need to give an impetus to jack mcmurdo's popularity among his fellows it would have be his arrest and acquittal
that a man on the very night of join the lodge should have do something which bring him before the magistrate be a new record in the annals of the society
already he have earn the reputation of a good boon companion a cheery reveller and withal a man of high temper who would not take an insult even from the all powerful boss himself
but in addition to this he impress his comrades with the idea that among them all there be not one whose brain be so ready to devise a bloodthirsty scheme or whose hand would be more capable of carry it out
he'll be the boy for the clean job say the oldsters to one another and wait their time until they could set him to his work
mcginty have instrument enough already but he recognize that this be a supremely able one
he felt like a man hold a fierce bloodhound in leash
there be curs to do the smaller work but some day he would slip this creature upon its prey
a few members of the lodge ted baldwin among them resent the rapid rise of the stranger and hat him for it but they keep clear of him for he be as ready to fight as to laugh
but if he gain favour with his fellows there be another quarter one which have become even more vital to him in which he lose it
ettie shafter's father would have nothing more to do with him nor would he allow him to enter the house
ettie herself be too deeply in love to give him up altogether and yet her own good sense warn her of what would come from a marriage with a man who be regard as a criminal
one morning after a sleepless night she determine to see him possibly for the last time and make one strong endeavour to draw him from those evil influence which be suck him down
she go to his house as he have often beg her to do and make her way into the room which he use as his sit room
he be seat at a table with his back turn and a letter in front of him
a sudden spirit of girlish mischief come over her she be still only nineteen
he have not hear her when she push open the door
now she tiptoe forward and lay her hand lightly upon his bend shoulder
if she have expect to startle him she certainly succeed but only in turn to be startle herself
with a tiger spring he turn on her and his right hand be feel for her throat
at the same instant with the other hand he crumple up the paper that lay before him
for an instant he stand glare
then astonishment and joy take the place of the ferocity which have convulse his feature a ferocity which have send her shrink back in horror as from something which have never before intrude into her gentle life
it's you
say he mop his brow
and to think that you should come to me heart of my heart and i should find nothing better to do than to want to strangle you
come then darling and he hold out his arm let me make it up to you
but she have not recover from that sudden glimpse of guilty fear which she have read in the man's face
all her woman's instinct tell her that it be not the mere fright of a man who be startle
guilt that be it guilt and fear
what's come over you jack
she cry
why be you so scar of me
oh jack if your conscience be at ease you would not have look at me like that
sure i be think of other things and when you come trip so lightly on those fairy feet of yours no no it be more than that jack
then a sudden suspicion seize her
let me see that letter you be write
ah ettie i couldn't do that
her suspicions become certainties
it's to another woman she cry
i know it
why else should you hold it from me
be it to your wife that you be write
how be i to know that you be not a marry man you a stranger that nobody know
i be not marry ettie
see now i swear it
you're the only one woman on earth to me
by the cross of christ i swear it
he be so white with passionate earnestness that she could not but believe him
well then she cry why will you not show me the letter
i'll tell you acushla say he
i'm under oath not to show it and just as i wouldn't break my word to you so i would keep it to those who hold my promise
it's the business of the lodge and even to you it's secret
and if i be scar when a hand fell on me can't you understand it when it might have be the hand of a detective
she felt that he be tell the truth
he gather her into his arm and kiss away her fear and doubt
sit here by me then
it's a queer throne for such a queen but it's the best your poor lover can find
he'll do better for you some of these days i'm think
now your mind be easy once again be it not
how can it ever be at ease jack when i know that you be a criminal among criminals when i never know the day that i may hear you be in court for murder
'mcmurdo the scowrer ' that's what one of our boarders call you yesterday
it go through my heart like a knife
sure hard word break no bone
but they be true
well dear it's not so bad as you think
we be but poor men that be try in our own way to get our right
ettie throw her arm round her lover's neck
give it up jack
for my sake for god's sake give it up
it be to ask you that i come here to day
oh jack see i beg it of you on my bend knees
kneel here before you i implore you to give it up
he raise her and soothe her with her head against his breast
sure my darlin' you don't know what it be you be ask
how could i give it up when it would be to break my oath and to desert my comrades
if you could see how things stand with me you could never ask it of me
besides if i want to how could i do it
you don't suppose that the lodge would let a man go free with all its secrets
i've think of that jack
i've plan it all
father have save some money
he be weary of this place where the fear of these people darken our live
he be ready to go
we would fly together to philadelphia or new york where we would be safe from them
mcmurdo laugh
the lodge have a long arm
do you think it could not stretch from here to philadelphia or new york
well then to the west or to england or to germany where father come from anywhere to get away from this valley of fear
mcmurdo think of old brother morris
sure it be the second time i have hear the valley so name say he
the shadow do indeed seem to lie heavy on some of you
it darken every moment of our live
do you suppose that ted baldwin have ever forgive us
if it be not that he fear you what do you suppose our chance would be
if you saw the look in those dark hungry eye of his when they fall on me
by gar
i'd teach him better manners if i catch him at it
but see here little girl
i can't leave here
i can't take that from me once and for all
but if you will leave me to find my own way i will try to prepare a way of get honourably out of it
there be no honour in such a matter
well well it's just how you look at it
but if you'll give me six months i'll work it so that i can leave without be ashamed to look others in the face
the girl laugh with joy
six months
she cry
be it a promise
well it may be seven or eight
but within a year at the furthest we will leave the valley behind us
it be the most that ettie could obtain and yet it be something
there be this distant light to illuminate the gloom of the immediate future
she return to her father's house more light hearted than she have ever be since jack mcmurdo have come into her life
it might be think that as a member all the do of the society would be tell to him but he be soon to discover that the organization be wider and more complex than the simple lodge
even boss mcginty be ignorant as to many things for there be an official name the county delegate live at hobson's patch farther down the line who have power over several different lodge which he wield in a sudden and arbitrary way
only once do mcmurdo see him a sly little gray haired rat of a man with a slink gait and a sidelong glance which be charge with malice
evans pott be his name and even the great boss of vermissa felt towards him something of the repulsion and fear which the huge danton may have felt for the puny but dangerous robespierre
one day scanlan who be mcmurdo's fellow boarder receive a note from mcginty inclose one from evans pott which inform him that he be send over two good men lawler and andrews who have instructions to act in the neighbourhood though it be best for the cause that no particulars as to their object should be give
would the bodymaster see to it that suitable arrangements be make for their lodge and comfort until the time for action should arrive
mcginty add that it be impossible for anyone to remain secret at the union house and that therefore he would be oblige if mcmurdo and scanlan would put the strangers up for a few days in their board house
the same even the two men arrive each carry his gripsack
lawler be an elderly man shrewd silent and self contain clothe in an old black frock coat which with his soft felt hat and rag grizzle beard give him a general resemblance to an itinerant preacher
his companion andrews be little more than a boy frank face and cheerful with the breezy manner of one who be out for a holiday and mean to enjoy every minute of it
both men be total abstainers and behave in all ways as exemplary members of the society with the one simple exception that they be assassins who have often prove themselves to be most capable instrument for this association of murder
lawler have already carry out fourteen commission of the kind and andrews three
they be as mcmurdo find quite ready to converse about their deeds in the past which they recount with the half bashful pride of men who have do good and unselfish service for the community
they be reticent however as to the immediate job in hand
they choose us because neither i nor the boy here drink lawler explain
they can count on us say no more than we should
you must not take it amiss but it be the order of the county delegate that we obey
sure we be all in it together say scanlan mcmurdo's mate as the four sit together at supper
that's true enough and we'll talk till the cow come home of the kill of charlie williams or of simon bird or any other job in the past
but till the work be do we say nothing
there be half a dozen about here that i have a word to say to say mcmurdo with an oath
i suppose it isn't jack knox of ironhill that you be after
i'd go some way to see him get his desert
no it's not him yet
or herman strauss
no nor him either
well if you won't tell us we can't make you but i'd be glad to know
lawler smile and shake his head
he be not to be draw
in spite of the reticence of their guests scanlan and mcmurdo be quite determine to be present at what they call the fun
when therefore at an early hour one morning mcmurdo hear them creep down the stairs he awaken scanlan and the two hurry on their clothe
when they be dress they find that the others have steal out leave the door open behind them
it be not yet dawn and by the light of the lamps they could see the two men some distance down the street
they follow them warily tread noiselessly in the deep snow
the board house be near the edge of the town and soon they be at the crossroads which be beyond its boundary
here three men be wait with whom lawler and andrews hold a short eager conversation
then they all move on together
it be clearly some notable job which need number
at this point there be several trail which lead to various mine
the strangers take that which lead to the crow hill a huge business which be in strong hand which have be able thank to their energetic and fearless new england manager josiah h dunn to keep some order and discipline during the long reign of terror
day be break now and a line of workmen be slowly make their way singly and in group along the blacken path
mcmurdo and scanlan stroll on with the others keep in sight of the men whom they follow
a thick mist lay over them and from the heart of it there come the sudden scream of a steam whistle
it be the ten minute signal before the cage descend and the day's labour begin
when they reach the open space round the mine shaft there be a hundred miners wait stamp their feet and blow on their finger for it be bitterly cold
the strangers stand in a little group under the shadow of the engine house
scanlan and mcmurdo climb a heap of slag from which the whole scene lay before them
they saw the mine engineer a great beard scotchman name menzies come out of the engine house and blow his whistle for the cage to be lower
at the same instant a tall loose frame young man with a clean shave earnest face advance eagerly towards the pit head
as he come forward his eye fell upon the group silent and motionless under the engine house
the men have draw down their hat and turn up their collar to screen their face
for a moment the presentiment of death lay its cold hand upon the manager's heart
at the next he have shake it off and saw only his duty towards intrusive strangers
who be you
he ask as he advance
what be you loiter there for
there be no answer but the lad andrews step forward and shoot him in the stomach
the hundred wait miners stand as motionless and helpless as if they be paralyze
the manager clap his two hand to the wind and double himself up
then he stagger away but another of the assassins fire and he go down sidewise kick and claw among a heap of clinker
menzies the scotchman give a roar of rage at the sight and rush with an iron spanner at the murderers but be meet by two ball in the face which drop him dead at their very feet
there be a surge forward of some of the miners and an inarticulate cry of pity and of anger but a couple of the strangers empty their six shooters over the head of the crowd and they break and scatter some of them rush wildly back to their home in vermissa
when a few of the bravest have rally and there be a return to the mine the murderous gang have vanish in the mist of morning without a single witness be able to swear to the identity of these men who in front of a hundred spectators have work this double crime
scanlan and mcmurdo make their way back scanlan somewhat subdue for it be the first murder job that he have see with his own eye and it appear less funny than he have be lead to believe
the horrible scream of the dead manager's wife pursue them as they hurry to the town
mcmurdo be absorb and silent but he show no sympathy for the weaken of his companion
sure it be like a war he repeat
what be it but a war between us and them and we hit back where we best can
there be high revel in the lodge room at the union house that night not only over the kill of the manager and engineer of the crow hill mine which would bring this organization into line with the other blackmail and terror stricken company of the district but also over a distant triumph which have be work by the hand of the lodge itself
it would appear that when the county delegate have send over five good men to strike a blow in vermissa he have demand that in return three vermissa men should be secretly select and send across to kill william hale of stake royal one of the best know and most popular mine owners in the gilmerton district a man who be believe not to have an enemy in the world for he be in all ways a model employer
he have insist however upon efficiency in the work and have therefore pay off certain drunken and idle employees who be members of the all powerful society
coffin notice hang outside his door have not weaken his resolution and so in a free civilize country he find himself condemn to death
the execution have now be duly carry out
ted baldwin who sprawl now in the seat of honour beside the bodymaster have be chief of the party
his flush face and glaze blood shoot eye tell of sleeplessness and drink
he and his two comrades have spend the night before among the mountains
they be unkempt and weather stain
but no heroes return from a forlorn hope could have have a warmer welcome from their comrades
the story be tell and retell amid cry of delight and shout of laughter
they have wait for their man as he drive home at nightfall take their station at the top of a steep hill where his horse must be at a walk
he be so furred to keep out the cold that he could not lay his hand on his pistol
they have pull him out and shoot him again and again
he have scream for mercy
the scream be repeat for the amusement of the lodge
let's hear again how he squeal they cry
none of them know the man but there be eternal drama in a kill and they have show the scowrers of gilmerton that the vermissa men be to be rely upon
there have be one contretemps for a man and his wife have drive up while they be still empty their revolvers into the silent body
it have be suggest that they should shoot them both but they be harmless folk who be not connect with the mine so they be sternly bid to drive on and keep silent lest a worse thing befall them
and so the blood mottle figure have be leave as a warn to all such hard hearted employers and the three noble avengers have hurry off into the mountains where unbroken nature come down to the very edge of the furnaces and the slag heap
here they be safe and sound their work well do and the plaudits of their companion in their ears
it have be a great day for the scowrers
the shadow have fall even darker over the valley
but as the wise general choose the moment of victory in which to redouble his efforts so that his foes may have no time to steady themselves after disaster so boss mcginty look out upon the scene of his operations with his brood and malicious eye have devise a new attack upon those who oppose him
that very night as the half drunken company break up he touch mcmurdo on the arm and lead him aside into that inner room where they have their first interview
see here my lad say he i've get a job that's worthy of you at last
you'll have the do of it in your own hand
proud i be to hear it mcmurdo answer
you can take two men with you manders and reilly
they have be warn for service
we'll never be right in this district until chester wilcox have be settle and you'll have the thank of every lodge in the coal field if you can down him
i'll do my best anyhow
who be he and where shall i find him
mcginty take his eternal half chew half smoke cigar from the corner of his mouth and proceed to draw a rough diagram on a page tear from his notebook
he's the chief foreman of the iron dike company
he's a hard citizen an old colour sergeant of the war all scar and grizzle
we've have two try at him but have no luck and jim carnaway lose his life over it
now it's for you to take it over
that's the house all alone at the iron dike crossroad same as you see here on the map without another within earshot
it's no good by day
he's arm and shoot quick and straight with no question ask
but at night well there he be with his wife three children and a hire help
you can't pick or choose
it's all or none
if you could get a bag of blast powder at the front door with a slow match to it what's the man do
didn't i tell you he shoot jim carnaway
why do he shoot him
what in thunder have that to do with you
carnaway be about his house at night and he shoot him
that's enough for me and you
you've get to settle the thing right
there's these two women and the children
do they go up too
they have to else how can we get him
it seem hard on them for they've do nothing
what sort of fool's talk be this
do you back out
easy councillor easy
what have i ever say or do that you should think i would be after stand back from an order of the bodymaster of my own lodge
if it's right or if it's wrong it's for you to decide
you'll do it then
of course i will do it
when
well you have best give me a night or two that i may see the house and make my plan
then very good say mcginty shake him by the hand
i leave it with you
it will be a great day when you bring us the news
it's just the last stroke that will bring them all to their knees
mcmurdo think long and deeply over the commission which have be so suddenly place in his hand
the isolate house in which chester wilcox live be about five miles off in an adjacent valley
that very night he start off all alone to prepare for the attempt
it be daylight before he return from his reconnaissance
next day he interview his two subordinate manders and reilly reckless youngsters who be as elate as if it be a deer hunt
two nights later they meet outside the town all three arm and one of them carry a sack stuff with the powder which be use in the quarry
it be two in the morning before they come to the lonely house
the night be a windy one with break cloud drift swiftly across the face of a three quarter moon
they have be warn to be on their guard against bloodhounds so they move forward cautiously with their pistols cock in their hand
but there be no sound save the howl of the wind and no movement but the sway branch above them
mcmurdo listen at the door of the lonely house but all be still within
then he lean the powder bag against it rip a hole in it with his knife and attach the fuse
when it be well alight he and his two companion take to their heel and be some distance off safe and snug in a shelter ditch before the shatter roar of the explosion with the low deep rumble of the collapse build tell them that their work be do
no cleaner job have ever be carry out in the bloodstained annals of the society
but alas that work so well organize and boldly carry out should all have go for nothing
warn by the fate of the various victims and know that he be mark down for destruction chester wilcox have move himself and his family only the day before to some safer and less know quarter where a guard of police should watch over them
it be an empty house which have be tear down by the gunpowder and the grim old colour sergeant of the war be still teach discipline to the miners of iron dike
leave him to me say mcmurdo
he's my man and i'll get him sure if i have to wait a year for him
a vote of thank and confidence be pass in full lodge and so for the time the matter end
when a few weeks later it be report in the paper that wilcox have be shoot at from an ambuscade it be an open secret that mcmurdo be still at work upon his unfinished job
such be the methods of the society of freemen and such be the deeds of the scowrers by which they spread their rule of fear over the great and rich district which be for so long a period haunt by their terrible presence
why should these page be stain by further crimes
have i not say enough to show the men and their methods
these deeds be write in history and there be record wherein one may read the detail of them
there one may learn of the shoot of policemen hunt and evans because they have venture to arrest two members of the society a double outrage plan at the vermissa lodge and carry out in cold blood upon two helpless and disarm men
there also one may read of the shoot of mrs
larbey when she be nurse her husband who have be beat almost to death by order of boss mcginty
the kill of the elder jenkins shortly follow by that of his brother the mutilation of jam murdoch the blow up of the staphouse family and the murder of the stendals all follow hard upon one another in the same terrible winter
darkly the shadow lay upon the valley of fear
the spring have come with run brook and blossom tree
there be hope for all nature bind so long in an iron grip but nowhere be there any hope for the men and women who live under the yoke of the terror
never have the cloud above them be so dark and hopeless as in the early summer of the year
it be the height of the reign of terror
mcmurdo who have already be appoint inner deacon with every prospect of some day succeed mcginty as bodymaster be now so necessary to the councils of his comrades that nothing be do without his help and advice
the more popular he become however with the freemen the blacker be the scowl which greet him as he pass along the streets of vermissa
in spite of their terror the citizens be take heart to band themselves together against their oppressors
rumour have reach the lodge of secret gather in the herald office and of distribution of firearms among the law abide people
but mcginty and his men be undisturbed by such report
they be numerous resolute and well arm
their opponents be scatter and powerless
it would all end as it have do in the past in aimless talk and possibly in impotent arrest
so say mcginty mcmurdo and all the bolder spirit
it be a saturday even in may
saturday be always the lodge night and mcmurdo be leave his house to attend it when morris the weaker brother of the order come to see him
his brow be crease with care and his kindly face be draw and haggard
can i speak with you freely mr
mcmurdo
sure
i can't forget that i speak my heart to you once and that you keep it to yourself even though the boss himself come to ask you about it
what else could i do if you trust me
it wasn't that i agree with what you say
i know that well
but you be the one that i can speak to and be safe
i've a secret here he put his hand to his breast and it be just burn the life out of me
i wish it have come to any one of you but me
if i tell it it will mean murder for sure
if i don't it may bring the end of us all
god help me but i be near out of my wits over it
mcmurdo look at the man earnestly
he be tremble in every limb
he pour some whisky into a glass and hand it to him
that's the physic for the like of you say he
now let me hear of it
morris drink and his white face take a tinge of colour
i can tell it to you all in one sentence say he
there's a detective on our trail
mcmurdo star at him in astonishment
why man you're crazy he say
isn't the place full of police and detectives and what harm do they ever do us
no no it's no man of the district
as you say we know them and it be little that they can do
but you've hear of pinkerton's
i've read of some folk of that name
well you can take it from me you've no show when they be on your trail
it's not a take it or miss it government concern
it's a dead earnest business proposition that's out for result and keep out till by hook or crook it get them
if a pinkerton man be deep in this business we be all destroy
we must kill him
ah it's the first think that come to you
so it will be up at the lodge
didn't i say to you that it would end in murder
sure what be murder
isn't it common enough in these part
it be indeed but it's not for me to point out the man that be to be murder
i'd never rest easy again
and yet it's our own neck that may be at stake
in god's name what shall i do
he rock to and fro in his agony of indecision
but his word have move mcmurdo deeply
it be easy to see that he share the other's opinion as to the danger and the need for meet it
he grip morris's shoulder and shake him in his earnestness
see here man he cry and he almost screech the word in his excitement you won't gain anything by sit keen like an old wife at a wake
let's have the facts
who be the fellow
where be he
how do you hear of him
why do you come to me
i come to you for you be the one man that would advise me
i tell you that i have a store in the east before i come here
i leave good friends behind me and one of them be in the telegraph service
here's a letter that i have from him yesterday
it's this part from the top of the page
you can read it yourself
this be what mcmurdo read how be the scowrers get on in your part
we read plenty of them in the paper
between you and me i expect to hear news from you before long
five big corporations and the two railroad have take the thing up in dead earnest
they mean it and you can bet they'll get there
they be right deep down into it
pinkerton have take hold under their order and his best man birdy edwards be operate
the thing have get to be stop right now
now read the postscript
of course what i give you be what i learn in business so it go no further
it's a queer cipher that you handle by the yard every day and can get no mean from
mcmurdo sit in silence for some time with the letter in his listless hand
the mist have lift for a moment and there be the aby before him
do anyone else know of this
he ask
i have tell no one else
but this man your friend have he any other person that he would be likely to write to
well i dare say he know one or two more
of the lodge
it's likely enough
i be ask because it be likely that he may have give some description of this fellow birdy edwards then we could get on his trail
well it's possible
but i should not think he know him
he be just tell me the news that come to him by way of business
how would he know this pinkerton man
mcmurdo give a violent start
by gar
he cry i've get him
what a fool i be not to know it
lord
but we're in luck
we will fix him before he can do any harm
see here morris will you leave this thing in my hand
sure if you will only take it off mine
i'll do that
you can stand right back and let me run it
even your name need not be mention
i'll take it all on myself as if it be to me that this letter have come
will that content you
it's just what i would ask
then leave it at that and keep your head shut
now i'll get down to the lodge and we'll soon make old man pinkerton sorry for himself
you wouldn't kill this man
the less you know friend morris the easier your conscience will be and the better you will sleep
ask no question and let these things settle themselves
i have hold of it now
morris shake his head sadly as he leave
i feel that his blood be on my hand he groan
self protection be no murder anyhow say mcmurdo smile grimly
it's him or us
i guess this man would destroy us all if we leave him long in the valley
why brother morris we'll have to elect you bodymaster yet for you've surely save the lodge
and yet it be clear from his action that he think more seriously of this new intrusion than his word would show
it may have be his guilty conscience it may have be the reputation of the pinkerton organization it may have be the knowledge that great rich corporations have set themselves the task of clear out the scowrers but whatever his reason his action be those of a man who be prepare for the worst
every paper which would incriminate him be destroy before he leave the house
after that he give a long sigh of satisfaction for it seem to him that he be safe
and yet the danger must still have press somewhat upon him for on his way to the lodge he stop at old man shafter's
the house be forbid him but when he tap at the window ettie come out to him
the dance irish deviltry have go from her lover's eye
she read his danger in his earnest face
something have happen
she cry
oh jack you be in danger
sure it be not very bad my sweetheart
and yet it may be wise that we make a move before it be worse
make a move
i promise you once that i would go some day
i think the time be come
i have news to night bad news and i see trouble come
the police
well a pinkerton
but sure you wouldn't know what that be acushla nor what it may mean to the like of me
i'm too deep in this thing and i may have to get out of it quick
you say you would come with me if i go
oh jack it would be the save of you
i'm an honest man in some things ettie
i wouldn't hurt a hair of your bonny head for all that the world can give nor ever pull you down one inch from the golden throne above the cloud where i always see you
would you trust me
she put her hand in his without a word
well then listen to what i say and do as i order you for indeed it's the only way for us
things be go to happen in this valley
i feel it in my bone
there may be many of us that will have to look out for ourselves
i'm one anyhow
if i go by day or night it's you that must come with me
i'd come after you jack
no no you shall come with me
if this valley be close to me and i can never come back how can i leave you behind and me perhaps in hide from the police with never a chance of a message
it's with me you must come
i know a good woman in the place i come from and it's there i'd leave you till we can get marry
will you come
yes jack i will come
god bless you for your trust in me
it's a fiend out of hell that i should be if i abuse it
now mark you ettie it will be just a word to you and when it reach you you will drop everything and come right down to the wait room at the depot and stay there till i come for you
day or night i'll come at the word jack
somewhat ease in mind now that his own preparations for escape have be begin mcmurdo go on to the lodge
it have already assemble and only by complicate sign and counter sign could he pass through the outer guard and inner guard who close tile it
a buzz of pleasure and welcome greet him as he enter
the long room be crowd and through the haze of tobacco smoke he saw the tangle black mane of the bodymaster the cruel unfriendly feature of baldwin the vulture face of harraway the secretary and a dozen more who be among the leaders of the lodge
he rejoice that they should all be there to take counsel over his news
indeed it's glad we be to see you brother
cry the chairman
there's business here that want a solomon in judgment to set it right
it's lander and egan explain his neighbour as he take his seat
they both claim the head money give by the lodge for the shoot of old man crabbe over at stylestown and who's to say which fire the bullet
mcmurdo rise in his place and raise his hand
the expression of his face freeze the attention of the audience
there be a dead hush of expectation
eminent bodymaster he say in a solemn voice i claim urgency
brother mcmurdo claim urgency say mcginty
it's a claim that by the rule of this lodge take precedence
now brother we attend you
mcmurdo take the letter from his pocket
eminent bodymaster and brethren he say i be the bearer of ill news this day but it be better that it should be know and discuss than that a blow should fall upon us without warn which would destroy us all
i have information that the most powerful and richest organizations in this state have bind themselves together for our destruction and that at this very moment there be a pinkerton detective one birdy edwards at work in the valley collect the evidence which may put a rope round the neck of many of us and send every man in this room into a felon's cell
that be the situation for the discussion of which i have make a claim of urgency
there be a dead silence in the room
it be break by the chairman
what be your evidence for this brother mcmurdo
he ask
it be in this letter which have come into my hand say mcmurdo
he read the passage aloud
it be a matter of honour with me that i can give no further particulars about the letter nor put it into your hand but i assure you that there be nothing else in it which can affect the interest of the lodge
i put the case before you as it have reach me
let me say mr
chairman say one of the older brethren that i have hear of birdy edwards and that he have the name of be the best man in the pinkerton service
do anyone know him by sight
ask mcginty
yes say mcmurdo i do
there be a murmur of astonishment through the hall
i believe we hold him in the hollow of our hand he continue with an exult smile upon his face
if we act quickly and wisely we can cut this thing short
if i have your confidence and your help it be little that we have to fear
what have we to fear anyhow
what can he know of our affairs
you might say so if all be as stanch as you councillor
but this man have all the millions of the capitalists at his back
do you think there be no weaker brother among all our lodge that could not be buy
he will get at our secrets maybe have get them already
there's only one sure cure
that he never leave the valley say baldwin
mcmurdo nod
good for you brother baldwin he say
you and i have have our differences but you have say the true word to night
where be he then
where shall we know him
eminent bodymaster say mcmurdo earnestly i would put it to you that this be too vital a thing for us to discuss in open lodge
god forbid that i should throw a doubt on anyone here but if so much as a word of gossip get to the ears of this man there would be an end of any chance of our get him
i would ask the lodge to choose a trusty committee mr
chairman yourself if i might suggest it and brother baldwin here and five more
then i can talk freely of what i know and of what i advise should be do
the proposition be at once adopt and the committee choose
besides the chairman and baldwin there be the vulture face secretary harraway tiger cormac the brutal young assassin carter the treasurer and the brothers willaby fearless and desperate men who would stick at nothing
the usual revelry of the lodge be short and subdue for there be a cloud upon the men's spirit and many there for the first time begin to see the cloud of avenge law drift up in that serene sky under which they have dwell so long
the horrors they have deal out to others have be so much a part of their settle live that the think of retribution have become a remote one and so seem the more startle now that it come so closely upon them
they break up early and leave their leaders to their council
now mcmurdo
say mcginty when they be alone
the seven men sit freeze in their seat
i say just now that i know birdy edwards mcmurdo explain
i need not tell you that he be not here under that name
he's a brave man but not a crazy one
he pass under the name of steve wilson and he be lodge at hobson's patch
how do you know this
because i fell into talk with him
i think little of it at the time nor would have give it a second think but for this letter but now i'm sure it's the man
i meet him on the cars when i go down the line on wednesday a hard case if ever there be one
he say he be a reporter
i believe it for the moment
want to know all he could about the scowrers and what he call 'the outrages' for a new york paper
ask me every kind of question so as to get something
you bet i be give nothing away
'i'd pay for it and pay well ' say he 'if i could get some stuff that would suit my editor '
i say what i think would please him best and he hand me a twenty dollar bill for my information
'there's ten time that for you ' say he 'if you can find me all that i want '
what do you tell him then
any stuff i could make up
how do you know he wasn't a newspaper man
i'll tell you
he get out at hobson's patch and so do i i chance into the telegraph bureau and he be leave it
'see here ' say the operator after he'd go out 'i guess we should charge double rat for this '
'i guess you should ' say i he have fill the form with stuff that might have be chinese for all we could make of it
'he fire a sheet of this off every day ' say the clerk
'yes ' say i 'it's special news for his paper and he's scar that the others should tap it '
that be what the operator think and what i think at the time but i think differently now
by gar
i believe you be right say mcginty
but what do you allow that we should do about it
why not go right down now and fix him
someone suggest
ay the sooner the better
i'd start this next minute if i know where we could find him say mcmurdo
he's in hobson's patch but i don't know the house
i've get a plan though if you'll only take my advice
well what be it
i'll go to the patch to morrow morning
i'll find him through the operator
he can locate him i guess
well then i'll tell him that i'm a freeman myself
i'll offer him all the secrets of the lodge for a price
you bet he'll tumble to it
i'll tell him the paper be at my house and that it's as much as my life would be worth to let him come while folk be about
he'll see that that's horse sense
let him come at ten o'clock at night and he shall see everything
that will fetch him sure
well
you can plan the rest for yourselves
widow macnamara's be a lonely house
she's as true as steel and as deaf as a post
there's only scanlan and me in the house
if i get his promise and i'll let you know if i do i'd have the whole seven of you come to me by nine o'clock
we'll get him in
if ever he get out alive well he can talk of birdy edwards's luck for the rest of his days
there's go to be a vacancy at pinkerton's or i'm mistake
leave it at that mcmurdo
at nine to morrow we'll be with you
you once get the door shut behind him and you can leave the rest with us
as mcmurdo have say the house in which he live be a lonely one and very well suit for such a crime as they have plan
it be on the extreme fringe of the town and stand well back from the road
in any other case the conspirators would have simply call out their man as they have many a time before and empty their pistols into his body but in this instance it be very necessary to find out how much he know how he know it and what have be pass on to his employers
it be possible that they be already too late and that the work have be do
if that be indeed so they could at least have their revenge upon the man who have do it
but they be hopeful that nothing of great importance have yet come to the detective's knowledge as otherwise they argue he would not have trouble to write down and forward such trivial information as mcmurdo claim to have give him
however all this they would learn from his own lips
once in their power they would find a way to make him speak
it be not the first time that they have handle an unwilling witness
mcmurdo go to hobson's patch as agree
the police seem to take particular interest in him that morning and captain marvin he who have claim the old acquaintance with him at chicago actually address him as he wait at the station
mcmurdo turn away and refuse to speak with him
he be back from his mission in the afternoon and saw mcginty at the union house
he be come he say
good
say mcginty
the giant be in his shirt sleeves with chain and seal gleam athwart his ample waistcoat and a diamond twinkle through the fringe of his bristle beard
drink and politics have make the boss a very rich as well as powerful man
the more terrible therefore seem that glimpse of the prison or the gallows which have rise before him the night before
do you reckon he know much
he ask anxiously
mcmurdo shake his head gloomily
he's be here some time six weeks at the least
i guess he didn't come into these part to look at the prospect
if he have be work among us all that time with the railroad money at his back i should expect that he have get result and that he have pass them on
there's not a weak man in the lodge cry mcginty
true as steel every man of them
and yet by the lord
there be that skunk morris
what about him
if any man give us away it would be he
i've a mind to send a couple of the boys round before even to give him a beat up and see what they can get from him
well there would be no harm in that mcmurdo answer
i won't deny that i have a like for morris and would be sorry to see him come to harm
he have speak to me once or twice over lodge matter and though he may not see them the same as you or i he never seem the sort that squeal
but still it be not for me to stand between him and you
i'll fix the old devil
say mcginty with an oath
i've have my eye on him this year past
well you know best about that mcmurdo answer
but whatever you do must be to morrow for we must lie low until the pinkerton affair be settle up
we can't afford to set the police buzz to day of all days
true for you say mcginty
and we'll learn from birdy edwards himself where he get his news if we have to cut his heart out first
do he seem to scent a trap
mcmurdo laugh
i guess i take him on his weak point he say
if he could get on a good trail of the scowrers he's ready to follow it into hell
i take his money mcmurdo grin as he produce a wad of dollar note and as much more when he have see all my paper
what paper
well there be no paper
but i fill him up about constitutions and book of rule and form of membership
he expect to get right down to the end of everything before he leave
faith he's right there say mcginty grimly
didn't he ask you why you didn't bring him the paper
as if i would carry such things and me a suspect man and captain marvin after speak to me this very day at the depot
ay i hear of that say mcginty
i guess the heavy end of this business be come on to you
we could put him down an old shaft when we've do with him but however we work it we can't get past the man live at hobson's patch and you be there to day
mcmurdo shrug his shoulder
if we handle it right they can never prove the kill say he
no one can see him come to the house after dark and i'll lay to it that no one will see him go
now see here councillor i'll show you my plan and i'll ask you to fit the others into it
you will all come in good time
very well
he come at ten
he be to tap three time and me to open the door for him
then i'll get behind him and shut it
he's our man then
that's all easy and plain
yes but the next step want consider
he's a hard proposition
he's heavily arm
i've fool him proper and yet he be likely to be on his guard
suppose i show him right into a room with seven men in it where he expect to find me alone
there be go to be shoot and somebody be go to be hurt
that's so
and the noise be go to bring every damn copper in the township on top of it
i guess you be right
this be how i should work it
you will all be in the big room same as you saw when you have a chat with me
i'll open the door for him show him into the parlour beside the door and leave him there while i get the paper
that will give me the chance of tell you how things be shape
then i will go back to him with some fake paper
as he be read them i will jump for him and get my grip on his pistol arm
you'll hear me call and in you will rush
the quicker the better for he be as strong a man as i and i may have more than i can manage
but i allow that i can hold him till you come
it's a good plan say mcginty
the lodge will owe you a debt for this
i guess when i move out of the chair i can put a name to the man that's come after me
sure councillor i be little more than a recruit say mcmurdo but his face show what he think of the great man's compliment
when he have return home he make his own preparations for the grim even in front of him
first he clean oil and load his smith wesson revolver
then he survey the room in which the detective be to be trap
it be a large apartment with a long deal table in the centre and the big stave at one side
at each of the other side be windows
there be no shutter on these only light curtain which draw across
mcmurdo examine these attentively
no doubt it must have strike him that the apartment be very expose for so secret a meet
yet its distance from the road make it of less consequence
finally he discuss the matter with his fellow lodger
scanlan though a scowrer be an inoffensive little man who be too weak to stand against the opinion of his comrades but be secretly horrify by the deeds of blood at which he have sometimes be force to assist
mcmurdo tell him shortly what be intend
and if i be you mike scanlan i would take a night off and keep clear of it
there will be bloody work here before morning
well indeed then mac scanlan answer
it's not the will but the nerve that be want in me
when i saw manager dunn go down at the colliery yonder it be just more than i could stand
i'm not make for it same as you or mcginty
if the lodge will think none the worse of me i'll just do as you advise and leave you to yourselves for the even
the men come in good time as arrange
they be outwardly respectable citizens well clothe and cleanly but a judge of face would have read little hope for birdy edwards in those hard mouth and remorseless eye
there be not a man in the room whose hand have not be redden a dozen time before
they be as harden to human murder as a butcher to sheep
foremost of course both in appearance and in guilt be the formidable boss
harraway the secretary be a lean bitter man with a long scraggy neck and nervous jerky limbs a man of incorruptible fidelity where the finance of the order be concern and with no notion of justice or honesty to anyone beyond
the treasurer carter be a middle age man with an impassive rather sulky expression and a yellow parchment skin
he be a capable organizer and the actual detail of nearly every outrage have spring from his plot brain
the two willabys be men of action tall lithe young fellows with determine face while their companion tiger cormac a heavy dark youth be fear even by his own comrades for the ferocity of his disposition
these be the men who assemble that night under the roof of mcmurdo for the kill of the pinkerton detective
their host have place whisky upon the table and they have hasten to prime themselves for the work before them
baldwin and cormac be already half drink and the liquor have bring out all their ferocity
cormac place his hand on the stave for an instant it have be light for the nights be still cold
that will do say he with an oath
ay say baldwin catch his mean
if he be strap to that we will have the truth out of him
we'll have the truth out of him never fear say mcmurdo
he have nerve of steel this man for though the whole weight of the affair be on him his manner be as cool and unconcerned as ever
the others mark it and applaud
you be the one to handle him say the boss approvingly
not a warn will he get till your hand be on his throat
it's a pity there be no shutter to your windows
mcmurdo go from one to the other and draw the curtain tighter
sure no one can spy upon us now
it's close upon the hour
maybe he won't come
maybe he'll get a sniff of danger say the secretary
he'll come never fear mcmurdo answer
he be as eager to come as you can be to see him
hark to that
they all sit like wax figure some with their glass arrest halfway to their lips
three loud knock have sound at the door
hush
mcmurdo raise his hand in caution
an exult glance go round the circle and hand be lay upon hide weapons
not a sound for your live
mcmurdo whisper as he go from the room close the door carefully behind him
with strain ears the murderers wait
they count the step of their comrade down the passage
then they hear him open the outer door
there be a few word as of greet
then they be aware of a strange step inside and of an unfamiliar voice
an instant later come the slam of the door and the turn of the key in the lock
their prey be safe within the trap
tiger cormac laugh horribly and boss mcginty clap his great hand across his mouth
be quiet you fool
he whisper
you'll be the undo of us yet
there be a mutter of conversation from the next room
it seem interminable
then the door open and mcmurdo appear his finger upon his lip
he come to the end of the table and look round at them
a subtle change have come over him
his manner be as of one who have great work to do
his face have set into granite firmness
his eye shine with a fierce excitement behind his spectacles
he have become a visible leader of men
they star at him with eager interest but he say nothing
still with the same singular gaze he look from man to man
well
cry boss mcginty at last
be he here
be birdy edwards here
yes mcmurdo answer slowly
birdy edwards be here
i be birdy edwards
there be ten second after that brief speech during which the room might have be empty so profound be the silence
the hiss of a kettle upon the stave rise sharp and strident to the ear
seven white face all turn upward to this man who dominate them be set motionless with utter terror
then with a sudden shiver of glass a bristle of glisten rifle barrel break through each window while the curtain be tear from their hang
at the sight boss mcginty give the roar of a wound bear and plunge for the half open door
a level revolver meet him there with the stern blue eye of captain marvin of the mine police gleam behind the sight
the boss recoil and fell back into his chair
you're safer there councillor say the man whom they have know as mcmurdo
and you baldwin if you don't take your hand off your pistol you'll cheat the hangman yet
pull it out or by the lord that make me there that will do
there be forty arm men round this house and you can figure it out for yourself what chance you have
take their pistols marvin
there be no possible resistance under the menace of those rifle
the men be disarm
sulky sheepish and amaze they still sit round the table
i'd like to say a word to you before we separate say the man who have trap them
i guess we may not meet again until you see me on the stand in the courthouse
i'll give you something to think over between now and then
you know me now for what i be
at last i can put my card on the table
i be birdy edwards of pinkerton's
i be choose to break up your gang
i have a hard and dangerous game to play
not a soul not one soul not my nearest and dearest know that i be play it
only captain marvin here and my employers know that
but it's over to night thank god and i be the winner
the seven pale rigid face look up at him
there be unappeasable hatred in their eye
he read the relentless threat
maybe you think that the game be not over yet
well i take my chance of that
anyhow some of you will take no further hand and there be sixty more besides yourselves that will see a jail this night
i'll tell you this that when i be put upon this job i never believe there be such a society as yours
i think it be paper talk and that i would prove it so
they tell me it be to do with the freemen so i go to chicago and be make one
then i be surer than ever that it be just paper talk for i find no harm in the society but a deal of good
still i have to carry out my job and i come to the coal valleys
when i reach this place i learn that i be wrong and that it wasn't a dime novel after all
so i stay to look after it
i never kill a man in chicago
i never mint a dollar in my life
those i give you be as good as any others but i never spend money better
but i know the way into your good wish and so i pretend to you that the law be after me
it all work just as i think
so i join your infernal lodge and i take my share in your councils
maybe they will say that i be as bad as you
they can say what they like so long as i get you
but what be the truth
the night i join you beat up old man stanger
i could not warn him for there be no time but i hold your hand baldwin when you would have kill him
if ever i have suggest things so as to keep my place among you they be things which i know i could prevent
i could not save dunn and menzies for i do not know enough but i will see that their murderers be hang
i give chester wilcox warn so that when i blow his house in he and his folk be in hide
there be many a crime that i could not stop but if you look back and think how often your man come home the other road or be down in town when you go for him or stay indoors when you think he would come out you'll see my work
you blast traitor
hiss mcginty through his close teeth
ay john mcginty you may call me that if it ease your smart
you and your like have be the enemy of god and man in these part
it take a man to get between you and the poor devil of men and women that you hold under your grip
there be just one way of do it and i do it
you call me a traitor but i guess there's many a thousand will call me a deliverer that go down into hell to save them
i've have three months of it
i wouldn't have three such months again if they let me loose in the treasury at washington for it
i have to stay till i have it all every man and every secret right here in this hand
i'd have wait a little longer if it hadn't come to my knowledge that my secret be come out
a letter have come into the town that would have set you wise to it all
then i have to act and act quickly
i've nothing more to say to you except that when my time come i'll die the easier when i think of the work i have do in this valley
now marvin i'll keep you no more
take them in and get it over
there be little more to tell
scanlan have be give a seal note to be leave at the address of miss ettie shafter a mission which he have accept with a wink and a know smile
in the early hours of the morning a beautiful woman and a much muffle man board a special train which have be send by the railroad company and make a swift unbroken journey out of the land of danger
it be the last time that ever either ettie or her lover set foot in the valley of fear
ten days later they be marry in chicago with old jacob shafter as witness of the wed
the trial of the scowrers be hold far from the place where their adherents might have terrify the guardians of the law
in vain they struggle
in vain the money of the lodge money squeeze by blackmail out of the whole countryside be spend like water in the attempt to save them
that cold clear unimpassioned statement from one who know every detail of their live their organization and their crimes be unshaken by all the wiles of their defenders
at last after so many years they be break and scatter
the cloud be lift forever from the valley
mcginty meet his fate upon the scaffold cringe and whine when the last hour come
eight of his chief followers share his fate
fifty odd have various degrees of imprisonment
the work of birdy edwards be complete
and yet as he have guess the game be not over yet
there be another hand to be play and yet another and another
ted baldwin for one have escape the scaffold so have the willabys so have several others of the fiercest spirit of the gang
for ten years they be out of the world and then come a day when they be free once more a day which edwards who know his men be very sure would be an end of his life of peace
they have swear an oath on all that they think holy to have his blood as a vengeance for their comrades
and well they strive to keep their vow
from chicago he be chase after two attempt so near success that it be sure that the third would get him
from chicago he go under a change name to california and it be there that the light go for a time out of his life when ettie edwards die
once again he be nearly kill and once again under the name of douglas he work in a lonely canyon where with an english partner name barker he amass a fortune
at last there come a warn to him that the bloodhounds be on his track once more and he clear only just in time for england
and thence come the john douglas who for a second time marry a worthy mate and live for five years as a sussex county gentleman a life which end with the strange happen of which we have hear
the police trial have pass in which the case of john douglas be refer to a higher court
so have the quarter sessions at which he be acquit as have act in self defense
get him out of england at any cost write holmes to the wife
there be force here which may be more dangerous than those he have escape
there be no safety for your husband in england
two months have go by and the case have to some extent pass from our mind
then one morning there come an enigmatic note slip into our letter box
dear me mr
holmes
dear me
say this singular epistle
there be neither superscription nor signature
i laugh at the quaint message but holmes show unwonted seriousness
deviltry watson
he remark and sit long with a cloud brow
late last night mrs
hudson our landlady bring up a message that a gentleman wish to see holmes and that the matter be of the utmost importance
close at the heel of his messenger come cecil barker our friend of the moated manor house
his face be draw and haggard
i've have bad news terrible news mr
holmes say he
i fear as much say holmes
you have not have a cable have you
i have have a note from someone who have
it's poor douglas
they tell me his name be edwards but he will always be jack douglas of benito canyon to me
i tell you that they start together for south africa in the palmyra three weeks ago
exactly
the ship reach cape town last night
i receive this cable from mrs douglas this morning jack have be lose overboard in gale off st helena
no one know how accident occur ivy douglas
ha
it come like that do it
say holmes thoughtfully
well i've no doubt it be well stage manage
you mean that you think there be no accident
none in the world
he be murder
surely
so i think also
these infernal scowrers this curse vindictive nest of criminals no no my good sir say holmes
there be a master hand here
it be no case of saw off shoot gun and clumsy six shooters
you can tell an old master by the sweep of his brush
i can tell a moriarty when i see one
this crime be from london not from america
but for what motive
because it be do by a man who cannot afford to fail one whose whole unique position depend upon the fact that all he do must succeed
a great brain and a huge organization have be turn to the extinction of one man
it be crush the nut with the hammer an absurd extravagance of energy but the nut be very effectually crush all the same
how come this man to have anything to do with it
i can only say that the first word that ever come to us of the business be from one of his lieutenants
these americans be well advise
have an english job to do they take into partnership as any foreign criminal could do this great consultant in crime
from that moment their man be doom
at first he would content himself by use his machinery in order to find their victim
then he would indicate how the matter might be treat
finally when he read in the report of the failure of this agent he would step in himself with a master touch
you hear me warn this man at birlstone manor house that the come danger be greater than the past
be i right
barker beat his head with his clench fist in his impotent anger
do you tell me that we have to sit down under this
do you say that no one can ever get level with this king devil
no i don't say that say holmes and his eye seem to be look far into the future
i don't say that he can't be beat
but you must give me time you must give me time
we all sit in silence for some minutes while those fateful eye still strain to pierce the veil
in the year i take my degree of doctor of medicine of the university of london and proceed to netley to go through the course prescribe for surgeons in the army
have complete my study there i be duly attach to the fifth northumberland fusiliers as assistant surgeon
the regiment be station in india at the time and before i could join it the second afghan war have break out
on land at bombay i learn that my corps have advance through the pass and be already deep in the enemy's country
i follow however with many other officer who be in the same situation as myself and succeed in reach candahar in safety where i find my regiment and at once enter upon my new duties
the campaign bring honour and promotion to many but for me it have nothing but misfortune and disaster
i be remove from my brigade and attach to the berkshires with whom i serve at the fatal battle of maiwand
there i be strike on the shoulder by a jezail bullet which shatter the bone and graze the subclavian artery
i should have fall into the hand of the murderous ghazis have it not be for the devotion and courage show by murray my orderly who throw me across a pack horse and succeed in bring me safely to the british line
wear with pain and weak from the prolong hardships which i have undergo i be remove with a great train of wound sufferers to the base hospital at peshawar
here i rally and have already improve so far as to be able to walk about the ward and even to bask a little upon the verandah when i be strike down by enteric fever that curse of our indian possessions
for months my life be despair of and when at last i come to myself and become convalescent i be so weak and emaciate that a medical board determine that not a day should be lose in send me back to england
i be dispatch accordingly in the troopship orontes and land a month later on portsmouth jetty with my health irretrievably ruin but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempt to improve it
i have neither kith nor kin in england and be therefore as free as air or as free as an income of eleven shill and sixpence a day will permit a man to be
under such circumstances i naturally gravitate to london that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the empire be irresistibly drain
there i stay for some time at a private hotel in the strand lead a comfortless meaningless existence and spend such money as i have considerably more freely than i ought
so alarm do the state of my finance become that i soon realize that i must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country or that i must make a complete alteration in my style of live
choose the latter alternative i begin by make up my mind to leave the hotel and to take up my quarter in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile
on the very day that i have come to this conclusion i be stand at the criterion bar when some one tap me on the shoulder and turn round i recognize young stamford who have be a dresser under me at barts
the sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of london be a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man
in old days stamford have never be a particular crony of mine but now i hail him with enthusiasm and he in his turn appear to be delight to see me
in the exuberance of my joy i ask him to lunch with me at the holborn and we start off together in a hansom
whatever have you be do with yourself watson
he ask in undisguised wonder as we rattle through the crowd london streets
you be as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut
i give him a short sketch of my adventure and have hardly conclude it by the time that we reach our destination
poor devil
he say commiseratingly after he have listen to my misfortunes
what be you up to now
look for lodge
i answer
try to solve the problem as to whether it be possible to get comfortable room at a reasonable price
that's a strange thing remark my companion you be the second man to day that have use that expression to me
and who be the first
i ask
a fellow who be work at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital
he be bemoan himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halve with him in some nice room which he have find and which be too much for his purse
by jove
i cry if he really want someone to share the room and the expense i be the very man for him
i should prefer have a partner to be alone
young stamford look rather strangely at me over his wine glass
you don't know sherlock holmes yet he say perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion
why what be there against him
oh i didn't say there be anything against him
he be a little queer in his ideas an enthusiast in some branch of science
as far as i know he be a decent fellow enough
a medical student i suppose
say i
no i have no idea what he intend to go in for
i believe he be well up in anatomy and he be a first class chemist but as far as i know he have never take out any systematic medical class
his study be very desultory and eccentric but he have amass a lot of out of the way knowledge which would astonish his professors
do you never ask him what he be go in for
i ask
no he be not a man that it be easy to draw out though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seize him
i should like to meet him i say
if i be to lodge with anyone i should prefer a man of studious and quiet habit
i be not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement
i have enough of both in afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence
how could i meet this friend of yours
he be sure to be at the laboratory return my companion
he either avoid the place for weeks or else he work there from morning to night
if you like we shall drive round together after luncheon
certainly i answer and the conversation drift away into other channel
as we make our way to the hospital after leave the holborn stamford give me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom i propose to take as a fellow lodger
you mustn't blame me if you don't get on with him he say i know nothing more of him than i have learn from meet him occasionally in the laboratory
you propose this arrangement so you must not hold me responsible
if we don't get on it will be easy to part company i answer
it seem to me stamford i add look hard at my companion that you have some reason for wash your hand of the matter
be this fellow's temper so formidable or what be it
don't be mealy mouth about it
it be not easy to express the inexpressible he answer with a laugh
holmes be a little too scientific for my taste it approach to cold bloodedness
i could imagine his give a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid not out of malevolence you understand but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effect
to do him justice i think that he would take it himself with the same readiness
he appear to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge
very right too
yes but it may be push to excess
when it come to beat the subject in the dissect room with a stick it be certainly take rather a bizarre shape
beat the subject
yes to verify how far bruise may be produce after death
i saw him at it with my own eye
and yet you say he be not a medical student
no
heaven know what the object of his study be
but here we be and you must form your own impressions about him
as he speak we turn down a narrow lane and pass through a small side door which open into a wing of the great hospital
it be familiar grind to me and i need no guide as we ascend the bleak stone staircase and make our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewash wall and dun colour doors
near the further end a low arch passage branch away from it and lead to the chemical laboratory
this be a lofty chamber line and litter with countless bottle
broad low table be scatter about which bristle with retort test tube and little bunsen lamps with their blue flicker flame
there be only one student in the room who be bend over a distant table absorb in his work
at the sound of our step he glance round and spring to his feet with a cry of pleasure
i've find it
i've find it he shout to my companion run towards us with a test tube in his hand
i have find a re agent which be precipitate by hoemoglobin and by nothing else
have he discover a gold mine greater delight could not have shine upon his feature
dr
watson mr
sherlock holmes say stamford introduce us
how be you
he say cordially grip my hand with a strength for which i should hardly have give him credit
you have be in afghanistan i perceive
how on earth do you know that
i ask in astonishment
never mind say he chuckle to himself
the question now be about hoemoglobin
no doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine
it be interest chemically no doubt i answer but practically why man it be the most practical medico legal discovery for years
don't you see that it give us an infallible test for blood stain
come over here now
he seize me by the coat sleeve in his eagerness and draw me over to the table at which he have be work
let us have some fresh blood he say dig a long bodkin into his finger and draw off the result drop of blood in a chemical pipette
now i add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water
you perceive that the result mixture have the appearance of pure water
the proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million
i have no doubt however that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction
as he speak he throw into the vessel a few white crystals and then add some drop of a transparent fluid
in an instant the content assume a dull mahogany colour and a brownish dust be precipitate to the bottom of the glass jar
ha
ha
he cry clap his hand and look as delight as a child with a new toy
what do you think of that
it seem to be a very delicate test i remark
beautiful
beautiful
the old guiacum test be very clumsy and uncertain
so be the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles
the latter be valueless if the stain be a few hours old
now this appear to act as well whether the blood be old or new
have this test be invent there be hundreds of men now walk the earth who would long ago have pay the penalty of their crimes
indeed
i murmur
criminal case be continually hinge upon that one point
a man be suspect of a crime months perhaps after it have be commit
his linen or clothe be examine and brownish stain discover upon them
be they blood stain or mud stain or rust stain or fruit stain or what be they
that be a question which have puzzle many an expert and why
because there be no reliable test
now we have the sherlock holmes' test and there will no longer be any difficulty
his eye fairly glitter as he speak and he put his hand over his heart and bow as if to some applaud crowd conjure up by his imagination
you be to be congratulate i remark considerably surprise at his enthusiasm
there be the case of von bischoff at frankfort last year
he would certainly have be hang have this test be in existence
then there be mason of bradford and the notorious muller and lefevre of montpellier and samson of new orleans
i could name a score of case in which it would have be decisive
you seem to be a walk calendar of crime say stamford with a laugh
you might start a paper on those line
call it the 'police news of the past '
very interest read it might be make too remark sherlock holmes stick a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger
i have to be careful he continue turn to me with a smile for i dabble with poison a good deal
he hold out his hand as he speak and i notice that it be all mottle over with similar piece of plaster and discolour with strong acids
we come here on business say stamford sit down on a high three legged stool and push another one in my direction with his foot
my friend here want to take diggings and as you be complain that you could get no one to go halve with you i think that i have better bring you together
sherlock holmes seem delight at the idea of share his room with me
i have my eye on a suite in baker street he say which would suit us down to the grind
you don't mind the smell of strong tobacco i hope
i always smoke 'ship's' myself i answer
that's good enough
i generally have chemicals about and occasionally do experiment
would that annoy you
by no mean
let me see what be my other shortcomings
i get in the dump at time and don't open my mouth for days on end
you must not think i be sulky when i do that
just let me alone and i'll soon be right
what have you to confess now
it's just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together
i laugh at this cross examination
i keep a bull pup i say and i object to row because my nerve be shake and i get up at all sort of ungodly hours and i be extremely lazy
i have another set of vices when i'm well but those be the principal ones at present
do you include violin play in your category of row
he ask anxiously
it depend on the player i answer
a well play violin be a treat for the gods a badly play one oh that's all right he cry with a merry laugh
i think we may consider the thing as settle that be if the room be agreeable to you
when shall we see them
call for me here at noon to morrow and we'll go together and settle everything he answer
all right noon exactly say i shake his hand
we leave him work among his chemicals and we walk together towards my hotel
by the way i ask suddenly stop and turn upon stamford how the deuce do he know that i have come from afghanistan
my companion smile an enigmatical smile
that's just his little peculiarity he say
a good many people have want to know how he find things out
oh
a mystery be it
i cry rub my hand
this be very piquant
i be much oblige to you for bring us together
'the proper study of mankind be man ' you know
you must study him then stamford say as he bid me good bye
you'll find him a knotty problem though
i'll wager he learn more about you than you about him
good bye
good bye i answer and stroll on to my hotel considerably interest in my new acquaintance
we meet next day as he have arrange and inspect the room at no
221b baker street of which he have speak at our meet
they consist of a couple of comfortable bed room and a single large airy sit room cheerfully furnish and illuminate by two broad windows
so desirable in every way be the apartments and so moderate do the term seem when divide between us that the bargain be conclude upon the spot and we at once enter into possession
that very even i move my things round from the hotel and on the follow morning sherlock holmes follow me with several box and portmanteaus
for a day or two we be busily employ in unpack and lay out our property to the best advantage
that do we gradually begin to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surround
holmes be certainly not a difficult man to live with
he be quiet in his ways and his habit be regular
it be rare for him to be up after ten at night and he have invariably breakfast and go out before i rise in the morning
sometimes he spend his day at the chemical laboratory sometimes in the dissect room and occasionally in long walk which appear to take him into the lowest portion of the city
nothing could exceed his energy when the work fit be upon him but now and again a reaction would seize him and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sit room hardly utter a word or move a muscle from morning to night
on these occasion i have notice such a dreamy vacant expression in his eye that i might have suspect him of be addict to the use of some narcotic have not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbid such a notion
as the weeks go by my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aim in life gradually deepen and increase
his very person and appearance be such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer
in height he be rather over six feet and so excessively lean that he seem to be considerably taller
his eye be sharp and pierce save during those intervals of torpor to which i have allude and his thin hawk like nose give his whole expression an air of alertness and decision
his chin too have the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination
his hand be invariably blot with ink and stain with chemicals yet he be possess of extraordinary delicacy of touch as i frequently have occasion to observe when i watch him manipulate his fragile philosophical instrument
the reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody when i confess how much this man stimulate my curiosity and how often i endeavour to break through the reticence which he show on all that concern himself
before pronounce judgment however be it remember how objectless be my life and how little there be to engage my attention
my health forbid me from venture out unless the weather be exceptionally genial and i have no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence
under these circumstances i eagerly hail the little mystery which hang around my companion and spend much of my time in endeavour to unravel it
he be not study medicine
he have himself in reply to a question confirm stamford's opinion upon that point
neither do he appear to have pursue any course of read which might fit him for a degree in science or any other recognize portal which would give him an entrance into the learn world
yet his zeal for certain study be remarkable and within eccentric limit his knowledge be so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astound me
surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he have some definite end in view
desultory readers be seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learn
no man burden his mind with small matter unless he have some very good reason for do so
his ignorance be as remarkable as his knowledge
of contemporary literature philosophy and politics he appear to know next to nothing
upon my quote thomas carlyle he inquire in the naivest way who he might be and what he have do
my surprise reach a climax however when i find incidentally that he be ignorant of the copernican theory and of the composition of the solar system
that any civilize human be in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travel round the sun appear to be to me such an extraordinary fact that i could hardly realize it
you appear to be astonish he say smile at my expression of surprise
now that i do know it i shall do my best to forget it
to forget it
you see he explain i consider that a man's brain originally be like a little empty attic and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose
a fool take in all the lumber of every sort that he come across so that the knowledge which might be useful to him get crowd out or at best be jumble up with a lot of other things so that he have a difficulty in lay his hand upon it
now the skilful workman be very careful indeed as to what he take into his brain attic
he will have nothing but the tool which may help him in do his work but of these he have a large assortment and all in the most perfect order
it be a mistake to think that that little room have elastic wall and can distend to any extent
depend upon it there come a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you know before
it be of the highest importance therefore not to have useless facts elbow out the useful ones
but the solar system
i protest
what the deuce be it to me
he interrupt impatiently you say that we go round the sun
if we go round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work
i be on the point of ask him what that work might be but something in his manner show me that the question would be an unwelcome one
i ponder over our short conversation however and endeavour to draw my deductions from it
he say that he would acquire no knowledge which do not bear upon his object
therefore all the knowledge which he possess be such as would be useful to him
i enumerate in my own mind all the various point upon which he have show me that he be exceptionally well inform
i even take a pencil and jot them down
i could not help smile at the document when i have complete it
it run in this way sherlock holmes his limit

knowledge of literature nil

philosophy nil

astronomy nil

politics feeble

botany variable
well up in belladonna opium and poison generally
know nothing of practical garden

geology practical but limit
tell at a glance different soil from each other
after walk have show me splash upon his trousers and tell me by their colour and consistence in what part of london he have receive them

chemistry profound

anatomy accurate but unsystematic

sensational literature immense
he appear to know every detail of every horror perpetrate in the century

play the violin well

be an expert singlestick player boxer and swordsman

have a good practical knowledge of british law
when i have get so far in my list i throw it into the fire in despair
if i can only find what the fellow be drive at by reconcile all these accomplishments and discover a call which need them all i say to myself i may as well give up the attempt at once
i see that i have allude above to his power upon the violin
these be very remarkable but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments
that he could play piece and difficult piece i know well because at my request he have play me some of mendelssohn's lieder and other favourites
when leave to himself however he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognize air
lean back in his arm chair of an even he would close his eye and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which be throw across his knee
sometimes the chord be sonorous and melancholy
occasionally they be fantastic and cheerful
clearly they reflect the thoughts which possess him but whether the music aid those thoughts or whether the play be simply the result of a whim or fancy be more than i could determine
i might have rebel against these exasperate solo have it not be that he usually terminate them by play in quick succession a whole series of my favourite air as a slight compensation for the trial upon my patience
during the first week or so we have no callers and i have begin to think that my companion be as friendless a man as i be myself
presently however i find that he have many acquaintances and those in the most different class of society
there be one little sallow rat face dark eye fellow who be introduce to me as mr
lestrade and who come three or four time in a single week
one morning a young girl call fashionably dress and stay for half an hour or more
the same afternoon bring a grey head seedy visitor look like a jew pedlar who appear to me to be much excite and who be closely follow by a slip shoe elderly woman
on another occasion an old white haired gentleman have an interview with my companion and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform
when any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance sherlock holmes use to beg for the use of the sit room and i would retire to my bed room
he always apologize to me for put me to this inconvenience
i have to use this room as a place of business he say and these people be my clients
again i have an opportunity of ask him a point blank question and again my delicacy prevent me from force another man to confide in me
i imagine at the time that he have some strong reason for not allude to it but he soon dispel the idea by come round to the subject of his own accord
it be upon the 4th of march as i have good reason to remember that i rise somewhat earlier than usual and find that sherlock holmes have not yet finish his breakfast
the landlady have become so accustom to my late habit that my place have not be lay nor my coffee prepare
with the unreasonable petulance of mankind i ring the bell and give a curt intimation that i be ready
then i pick up a magazine from the table and attempt to while away the time with it while my companion munch silently at his toast
one of the article have a pencil mark at the head and i naturally begin to run my eye through it
its somewhat ambitious title be the book of life and it attempt to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that come in his way
it strike me as be a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity
the reason be close and intense but the deductions appear to me to be far fetch and exaggerate
the writer claim by a momentary expression a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye to fathom a man's inmost thoughts
deceit accord to him be an impossibility in the case of one train to observation and analysis
his conclusions be as infallible as so many proposition of euclid
so startle would his result appear to the uninitiated that until they learn the process by which he have arrive at them they might well consider him as a necromancer
from a drop of water say the writer a logician could infer the possibility of an atlantic or a niagara without have see or hear of one or the other
so all life be a great chain the nature of which be know whenever we be show a single link of it
like all other arts the science of deduction and analysis be one which can only be acquire by long and patient study nor be life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it
before turn to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest difficulties let the enquirer begin by master more elementary problems
let him on meet a fellow mortal learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man and the trade or profession to which he belong
puerile as such an exercise may seem it sharpen the faculties of observation and teach one where to look and what to look for
by a man's finger nail by his coat sleeve by his boot by his trouser knees by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb by his expression by his shirt cuff by each of these things a man's call be plainly reveal
that all unite should fail to enlighten the competent enquirer in any case be almost inconceivable
what ineffable twaddle
i cry slap the magazine down on the table i never read such rubbish in my life
what be it
ask sherlock holmes
why this article i say point at it with my egg spoon as i sit down to my breakfast
i see that you have read it since you have mark it
i don't deny that it be smartly write
it irritate me though
it be evidently the theory of some arm chair lounger who evolve all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study
it be not practical
i should like to see him clap down in a third class carriage on the underground and ask to give the trade of all his fellow travellers
i would lay a thousand to one against him
you would lose your money sherlock holmes remark calmly
as for the article i write it myself
you
yes i have a turn both for observation and for deduction
the theories which i have express there and which appear to you to be so chimerical be really extremely practical so practical that i depend upon them for my bread and cheese
and how
i ask involuntarily
well i have a trade of my own
i suppose i be the only one in the world
i'm a consult detective if you can understand what that be
here in london we have lot of government detectives and lot of private ones
when these fellows be at fault they come to me and i manage to put them on the right scent
they lay all the evidence before me and i be generally able by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime to set them straight
there be a strong family resemblance about misdeeds and if you have all the detail of a thousand at your finger end it be odd if you can't unravel the thousand and first
lestrade be a well know detective
he get himself into a fog recently over a forgery case and that be what bring him here
and these other people
they be mostly send on by private inquiry agencies
they be all people who be in trouble about something and want a little enlighten
i listen to their story they listen to my comment and then i pocket my fee
but do you mean to say i say that without leave your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of although they have see every detail for themselves
quite so
i have a kind of intuition that way
now and again a case turn up which be a little more complex
then i have to bustle about and see things with my own eye
you see i have a lot of special knowledge which i apply to the problem and which facilitate matter wonderfully
those rule of deduction lay down in that article which arouse your scorn be invaluable to me in practical work
observation with me be second nature
you appear to be surprise when i tell you on our first meet that you have come from afghanistan
you be tell no doubt
nothing of the sort
i _knew_ you come from afghanistan
from long habit the train of thoughts run so swiftly through my mind that i arrive at the conclusion without be conscious of intermediate step
there be such step however
the train of reason run 'here be a gentleman of a medical type but with the air of a military man
clearly an army doctor then
he have just come from the tropics for his face be dark and that be not the natural tint of his skin for his wrists be fair
he have undergo hardship and sickness as his haggard face say clearly
his leave arm have be injure
he hold it in a stiff and unnatural manner
where in the tropics could an english army doctor have see much hardship and get his arm wound
clearly in afghanistan '
the whole train of think do not occupy a second
i then remark that you come from afghanistan and you be astonish
it be simple enough as you explain it i say smile
you remind me of edgar allen poe's dupin
i have no idea that such individuals do exist outside of stories
sherlock holmes rise and light his pipe
no doubt you think that you be compliment me in compare me to dupin he observe
now in my opinion dupin be a very inferior fellow
that trick of his of break in on his friends' thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour's silence be really very showy and superficial
he have some analytical genius no doubt but he be by no mean such a phenomenon as poe appear to imagine
have you read gaboriau's work
i ask
do lecoq come up to your idea of a detective
sherlock holmes sniff sardonically
lecoq be a miserable bungler he say in an angry voice he have only one thing to recommend him and that be his energy
that book make me positively ill
the question be how to identify an unknown prisoner
i could have do it in twenty four hours
lecoq take six months or so
it might be make a text book for detectives to teach them what to avoid
i felt rather indignant at have two character whom i have admire treat in this cavalier style
i walk over to the window and stand look out into the busy street
this fellow may be very clever i say to myself but he be certainly very conceited
there be no crimes and no criminals in these days he say querulously
what be the use of have brain in our profession
i know well that i have it in me to make my name famous
no man live or have ever live who have bring the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which i have do
and what be the result
there be no crime to detect or at most some bungle villainy with a motive so transparent that even a scotland yard official can see through it
i be still annoy at his bumptious style of conversation
i think it best to change the topic
i wonder what that fellow be look for
i ask point to a stalwart plainly dress individual who be walk slowly down the other side of the street look anxiously at the number
he have a large blue envelope in his hand and be evidently the bearer of a message
you mean the retire sergeant of marines say sherlock holmes
brag and bounce
think i to myself
he know that i cannot verify his guess
the think have hardly pass through my mind when the man whom we be watch catch sight of the number on our door and run rapidly across the roadway
we hear a loud knock a deep voice below and heavy step ascend the stair
for mr
sherlock holmes he say step into the room and hand my friend the letter
here be an opportunity of take the conceit out of him
he little think of this when he make that random shoot
may i ask my lad i say in the blandest voice what your trade may be
commissionaire sir he say gruffly
uniform away for repair
and you be
i ask with a slightly malicious glance at my companion
a sergeant sir royal marine light infantry sir
no answer
right sir
he click his heel together raise his hand in a salute and be go
i confess that i be considerably startle by this fresh proof of the practical nature of my companion's theories
my respect for his power of analysis increase wondrously
there still remain some lurk suspicion in my mind however that the whole thing be a pre arrange episode intend to dazzle me though what earthly object he could have in take me in be past my comprehension
when i look at him he have finish read the note and his eye have assume the vacant lack lustre expression which show mental abstraction
how in the world do you deduce that
i ask
deduce what
say he petulantly
why that he be a retire sergeant of marines
i have no time for trifle he answer brusquely then with a smile excuse my rudeness
you break the thread of my thoughts but perhaps it be as well
so you actually be not able to see that that man be a sergeant of marines
no indeed
it be easier to know it than to explain why i know it
if you be ask to prove that two and two make four you might find some difficulty and yet you be quite sure of the fact
even across the street i could see a great blue anchor tattoo on the back of the fellow's hand
that smack of the sea
he have a military carriage however and regulation side whisker
there we have the marine
he be a man with some amount of self importance and a certain air of command
you must have observe the way in which he hold his head and swing his cane
a steady respectable middle age man too on the face of him all facts which lead me to believe that he have be a sergeant
wonderful
i ejaculate
commonplace say holmes though i think from his expression that he be please at my evident surprise and admiration
i say just now that there be no criminals
it appear that i be wrong look at this
he throw me over the note which the commissionaire have bring
why i cry as i cast my eye over it this be terrible
it do seem to be a little out of the common he remark calmly
would you mind read it to me aloud
this be the letter which i read to him my dear mr
sherlock holmes there have be a bad business during the night at lauriston garden off the brixton road
our man on the beat saw a light there about two in the morning and as the house be an empty one suspect that something be amiss
he find the door open and in the front room which be bare of furniture discover the body of a gentleman well dress and have card in his pocket bear the name of 'enoch j drebber cleveland ohio u s a '
there have be no robbery nor be there any evidence as to how the man meet his death
there be mark of blood in the room but there be no wind upon his person
we be at a loss as to how he come into the empty house indeed the whole affair be a puzzler
if you can come round to the house any time before twelve you will find me there
i have leave everything _in statu quo_ until i hear from you
if you be unable to come i shall give you fuller detail and would esteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion
yours faithfully tobias gregson
gregson be the smartest of the scotland yarders my friend remark he and lestrade be the pick of a bad lot
they be both quick and energetic but conventional shockingly so
they have their knives into one another too
they be as jealous as a pair of professional beauties
there will be some fun over this case if they be both put upon the scent
i be amaze at the calm way in which he ripple on
surely there be not a moment to be lose i cry shall i go and order you a cab
i'm not sure about whether i shall go
i be the most incurably lazy devil that ever stand in shoe leather that be when the fit be on me for i can be spry enough at time
why it be just such a chance as you have be long for
my dear fellow what do it matter to me
suppose i unravel the whole matter you may be sure that gregson lestrade and co
will pocket all the credit
that come of be an unofficial personage
but he beg you to help him
yes
he know that i be his superior and acknowledge it to me but he would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person
however we may as well go and have a look
i shall work it out on my own hook
i may have a laugh at them if i have nothing else
come on
he hustle on his overcoat and bustle about in a way that show that an energetic fit have supersede the apathetic one
get your hat he say
you wish me to come
yes if you have nothing better to do
a minute later we be both in a hansom drive furiously for the brixton road
it be a foggy cloudy morning and a dun colour veil hang over the house top look like the reflection of the mud colour streets beneath
my companion be in the best of spirit and prattle away about cremona fiddle and the difference between a stradivarius and an amati
as for myself i be silent for the dull weather and the melancholy business upon which we be engage depress my spirit
you don't seem to give much think to the matter in hand i say at last interrupt holmes' musical disquisition
no data yet he answer
it be a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence
it bias the judgment
you will have your data soon i remark point with my finger this be the brixton road and that be the house if i be not very much mistake
so it be
stop driver stop
we be still a hundred yards or so from it but he insist upon our alight and we finish our journey upon foot
number lauriston garden wear an ill omen and minatory look
it be one of four which stand back some little way from the street two be occupy and two empty
the latter look out with three tiers of vacant melancholy windows which be blank and dreary save that here and there a to let card have develop like a cataract upon the blear pan
a small garden sprinkle over with a scatter eruption of sickly plant separate each of these house from the street and be traverse by a narrow pathway yellowish in colour and consist apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel
the whole place be very sloppy from the rain which have fall through the night
the garden be bound by a three foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rail upon the top and against this wall be lean a stalwart police constable surround by a small knot of loafers who crane their neck and strain their eye in the vain hope of catch some glimpse of the proceed within
i have imagine that sherlock holmes would at once have hurry into the house and plunge into a study of the mystery
nothing appear to be further from his intention
with an air of nonchalance which under the circumstances seem to me to border upon affectation he lounge up and down the pavement and gaze vacantly at the grind the sky the opposite house and the line of rail
have finish his scrutiny he proceed slowly down the path or rather down the fringe of grass which flank the path keep his eye rivet upon the grind
twice he stop and once i saw him smile and hear him utter an exclamation of satisfaction
there be many mark of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil but since the police have be come and go over it i be unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it
still i have have such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties that i have no doubt that he could see a great deal which be hide from me
at the door of the house we be meet by a tall white face flaxen haired man with a notebook in his hand who rush forward and wring my companion's hand with effusion
it be indeed kind of you to come he say i have have everything leave untouched
except that
my friend answer point at the pathway
if a herd of buffalo have pass along there could not be a greater mess
no doubt however you have draw your own conclusions gregson before you permit this
i have have so much to do inside the house the detective say evasively
my colleague mr
lestrade be here
i have rely upon him to look after this
holmes glance at me and raise his eyebrows sardonically
with two such men as yourself and lestrade upon the grind there will not be much for a third party to find out he say
gregson rub his hand in a self satisfy way
i think we have do all that can be do he answer it's a queer case though and i know your taste for such things
you do not come here in a cab
ask sherlock holmes
no sir
nor lestrade
no sir
then let us go and look at the room
with which inconsequent remark he stride on into the house follow by gregson whose feature express his astonishment
a short passage bare plank and dusty lead to the kitchen and offices
two doors open out of it to the leave and to the right
one of these have obviously be close for many weeks
the other belong to the din room which be the apartment in which the mysterious affair have occur
holmes walk in and i follow him with that subdue feel at my heart which the presence of death inspire
it be a large square room look all the larger from the absence of all furniture
a vulgar flare paper adorn the wall but it be blotch in place with mildew and here and there great strip have become detach and hang down expose the yellow plaster beneath
opposite the door be a showy fireplace surmount by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble
on one corner of this be stick the stump of a red wax candle
the solitary window be so dirty that the light be hazy and uncertain give a dull grey tinge to everything which be intensify by the thick layer of dust which coat the whole apartment
all these detail i observe afterwards
at present my attention be centre upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretch upon the board with vacant sightless eye star up at the discolour ceiling
it be that of a man about forty three or forty four years of age middle size broad shoulder with crisp curl black hair and a short stubbly beard
he be dress in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat with light colour trousers and immaculate collar and cuff
a top hat well brush and trim be place upon the floor beside him
his hand be clench and his arm throw abroad while his lower limbs be interlock as though his death struggle have be a grievous one
on his rigid face there stand an expression of horror and as it seem to me of hatred such as i have never see upon human feature
this malignant and terrible contortion combine with the low forehead blunt nose and prognathous jaw give the dead man a singularly simious and ape like appearance which be increase by his writhe unnatural posture
i have see death in many form but never have it appear to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment which look out upon one of the main arteries of suburban london
lestrade lean and ferret like as ever be stand by the doorway and greet my companion and myself
this case will make a stir sir he remark
it beat anything i have see and i be no chicken
there be no clue
say gregson
none at all chime in lestrade
sherlock holmes approach the body and kneel down examine it intently
you be sure that there be no wind
he ask point to numerous gouts and splash of blood which lay all round
positive
cry both detectives
then of course this blood belong to a second individual presumably the murderer if murder have be commit
it remind me of the circumstances attendant on the death of van jansen in utrecht in the year '
do you remember the case gregson
no sir
read it up you really should
there be nothing new under the sun
it have all be do before
as he speak his nimble finger be fly here there and everywhere feel press unbutton examine while his eye wear the same far away expression which i have already remark upon
so swiftly be the examination make that one would hardly have guess the minuteness with which it be conduct
finally he sniff the dead man's lips and then glance at the sole of his patent leather boot
he have not be move at all
he ask
no more than be necessary for the purpose of our examination
you can take him to the mortuary now he say
there be nothing more to be learn
gregson have a stretcher and four men at hand
at his call they enter the room and the stranger be lift and carry out
as they raise him a ring tinkle down and roll across the floor
lestrade grab it up and star at it with mystify eye
there's be a woman here he cry
it's a woman's wed ring
he hold it out as he speak upon the palm of his hand
we all gather round him and gaze at it
there could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold have once adorn the finger of a bride
this complicate matter say gregson
heaven know they be complicate enough before
you're sure it doesn't simplify them
observe holmes
there's nothing to be learn by star at it
what do you find in his pocket
we have it all here say gregson point to a litter of object upon one of the bottom step of the stairs
a gold watch no
by barraud of london
gold albert chain very heavy and solid
gold ring with masonic device
gold pin bull dog's head with rubies as eye
russian leather card case with card of enoch j drebber of cleveland correspond with the e j d upon the linen
no purse but loose money to the extent of seven pound thirteen
pocket edition of boccaccio's 'decameron ' with name of joseph stangerson upon the fly leaf
two letter one address to e j drebber and one to joseph stangerson
at what address
american exchange strand to be leave till call for
they be both from the guion steamship company and refer to the sail of their boat from liverpool
it be clear that this unfortunate man be about to return to new york
have you make any inquiries as to this man stangerson
i do it at once sir say gregson
i have have advertisements send to all the newspapers and one of my men have go to the american exchange but he have not return yet
have you send to cleveland
we telegraph this morning
how do you word your inquiries
we simply detail the circumstances and say that we should be glad of any information which could help us
you do not ask for particulars on any point which appear to you to be crucial
i ask about stangerson
nothing else
be there no circumstance on which this whole case appear to hinge
will you not telegraph again
i have say all i have to say say gregson in an offend voice
sherlock holmes chuckle to himself and appear to be about to make some remark when lestrade who have be in the front room while we be hold this conversation in the hall reappear upon the scene rub his hand in a pompous and self satisfy manner
mr
gregson he say i have just make a discovery of the highest importance and one which would have be overlook have i not make a careful examination of the wall
the little man's eye sparkle as he speak and he be evidently in a state of suppress exultation at have score a point against his colleague
come here he say bustle back into the room the atmosphere of which felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate
now stand there
he strike a match on his boot and hold it up against the wall
look at that
he say triumphantly
i have remark that the paper have fall away in part
in this particular corner of the room a large piece have peel off leave a yellow square of coarse plaster
across this bare space there be scrawl in blood red letter a single word rache
what do you think of that
cry the detective with the air of a showman exhibit his show
this be overlook because it be in the darkest corner of the room and no one think of look there
the murderer have write it with his or her own blood
see this smear where it have trickle down the wall
that dispose of the idea of suicide anyhow
why be that corner choose to write it on
i will tell you
see that candle on the mantelpiece
it be light at the time and if it be light this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of the wall
and what do it mean now that you _have_ find it
ask gregson in a depreciatory voice
mean
why it mean that the writer be go to put the female name rachel but be disturb before he or she have time to finish
you mark my word when this case come to be clear up you will find that a woman name rachel have something to do with it
it's all very well for you to laugh mr
sherlock holmes
you may be very smart and clever but the old hound be the best when all be say and do
i really beg your pardon
say my companion who have ruffle the little man's temper by burst into an explosion of laughter
you certainly have the credit of be the first of us to find this out and as you say it bear every mark of have be write by the other participant in last night's mystery
i have not have time to examine this room yet but with your permission i shall do so now
as he speak he whip a tape measure and a large round magnify glass from his pocket
with these two implement he trot noiselessly about the room sometimes stop occasionally kneel and once lie flat upon his face
so engross be he with his occupation that he appear to have forget our presence for he chatter away to himself under his breath the whole time keep up a run fire of exclamations groan whistle and little cry suggestive of encouragement and of hope
as i watch him i be irresistibly remind of a pure blood well train foxhound as it dash backwards and forward through the covert whine in its eagerness until it come across the lose scent
for twenty minutes or more he continue his research measure with the most exact care the distance between mark which be entirely invisible to me and occasionally apply his tape to the wall in an equally incomprehensible manner
in one place he gather up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor and pack it away in an envelope
finally he examine with his glass the word upon the wall go over every letter of it with the most minute exactness
this do he appear to be satisfy for he replace his tape and his glass in his pocket
they say that genius be an infinite capacity for take pain he remark with a smile
it's a very bad definition but it do apply to detective work
gregson and lestrade have watch the manoeuvre of their amateur companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt
they evidently fail to appreciate the fact which i have begin to realize that sherlock holmes' smallest action be all direct towards some definite and practical end
what do you think of it sir
they both ask
it would be rob you of the credit of the case if i be to presume to help you remark my friend
you be do so well now that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere
there be a world of sarcasm in his voice as he speak
if you will let me know how your investigations go he continue i shall be happy to give you any help i can
in the meantime i should like to speak to the constable who find the body
can you give me his name and address
lestrade glance at his note book
john rance he say
he be off duty now
you will find him at audley court kennington park gate
holmes take a note of the address
come along doctor he say we shall go and look him up
i'll tell you one thing which may help you in the case he continue turn to the two detectives
there have be murder do and the murderer be a man
he be more than six feet high be in the prime of life have small feet for his height wear coarse square toe boot and smoke a trichinopoly cigar
he come here with his victim in a four wheel cab which be draw by a horse with three old shoe and one new one on his off fore leg
in all probability the murderer have a florid face and the finger nail of his right hand be remarkably long
these be only a few indications but they may assist you
lestrade and gregson glance at each other with an incredulous smile
if this man be murder how be it do
ask the former
poison say sherlock holmes curtly and stride off
one other thing lestrade he add turn round at the door 'rache ' be the german for 'revenge ' so don't lose your time look for miss rachel
with which parthian shoot he walk away leave the two rival open mouth behind him
it be one o'clock when we leave no
lauriston garden
sherlock holmes lead me to the nearest telegraph office whence he dispatch a long telegram
he then hail a cab and order the driver to take us to the address give us by lestrade
there be nothing like first hand evidence he remark as a matter of fact my mind be entirely make up upon the case but still we may as well learn all that be to be learn
you amaze me holmes say i
surely you be not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you give
there's no room for a mistake he answer
the very first thing which i observe on arrive there be that a cab have make two rut with its wheel close to the curb
now up to last night we have have no rain for a week so that those wheel which leave such a deep impression must have be there during the night
there be the mark of the horse's hoof too the outline of one of which be far more clearly cut than that of the other three show that that be a new shoe
since the cab be there after the rain begin and be not there at any time during the morning i have gregson's word for that it follow that it must have be there during the night and therefore that it bring those two individuals to the house
that seem simple enough say i but how about the other man's height
why the height of a man in nine case out of ten can be tell from the length of his stride
it be a simple calculation enough though there be no use my bore you with figure
i have this fellow's stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within
then i have a way of check my calculation
when a man write on a wall his instinct lead him to write about the level of his own eye
now that write be just over six feet from the grind
it be child's play
and his age
i ask
well if a man can stride four and a half feet without the smallest effort he can't be quite in the sere and yellow
that be the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he have evidently walk across
patent leather boot have go round and square toe have hop over
there be no mystery about it at all
i be simply apply to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which i advocate in that article
be there anything else that puzzle you
the finger nail and the trichinopoly i suggest
the write on the wall be do with a man's forefinger dip in blood
my glass allow me to observe that the plaster be slightly scratch in do it which would not have be the case if the man's nail have be trim
i gather up some scatter ash from the floor
it be dark in colour and flakey such an ash as be only make by a trichinopoly
i have make a special study of cigar ash in fact i have write a monograph upon the subject
i flatter myself that i can distinguish at a glance the ash of any know brand either of cigar or of tobacco
it be just in such detail that the skilled detective differ from the gregson and lestrade type
and the florid face
i ask
ah that be a more dare shoot though i have no doubt that i be right
you must not ask me that at the present state of the affair
i pass my hand over my brow
my head be in a whirl i remark the more one think of it the more mysterious it grow
how come these two men if there be two men into an empty house
what have become of the cabman who drive them
how could one man compel another to take poison
where do the blood come from
what be the object of the murderer since robbery have no part in it
how come the woman's ring there
above all why should the second man write up the german word rache before decamp
i confess that i cannot see any possible way of reconcile all these facts
my companion smile approvingly
you sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well he say
there be much that be still obscure though i have quite make up my mind on the main facts
as to poor lestrade's discovery it be simply a blind intend to put the police upon a wrong track by suggest socialism and secret societies
it be not do by a german
the a if you notice be print somewhat after the german fashion
now a real german invariably print in the latin character so that we may safely say that this be not write by one but by a clumsy imitator who overdo his part
it be simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel
i'm not go to tell you much more of the case doctor
you know a conjuror get no credit when once he have explain his trick and if i show you too much of my method of work you will come to the conclusion that i be a very ordinary individual after all
i shall never do that i answer you have bring detection as near an exact science as it ever will be bring in this world
my companion flush up with pleasure at my word and the earnest way in which i utter them
i have already observe that he be as sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty
i'll tell you one other thing he say
patent leather and square toe come in the same cab and they walk down the pathway together as friendly as possible arm in arm in all probability
when they get inside they walk up and down the room or rather patent leather stand still while square toe walk up and down
i could read all that in the dust and i could read that as he walk he grow more and more excite
that be show by the increase length of his stride
he be talk all the while and work himself up no doubt into a fury
then the tragedy occur
i've tell you all i know myself now for the rest be mere surmise and conjecture
we have a good work basis however on which to start
we must hurry up for i want to go to halle's concert to hear norman neruda this afternoon
this conversation have occur while our cab have be thread its way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by ways
in the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly come to a stand
that's audley court in there he say point to a narrow slit in the line of dead colour brick
you'll find me here when you come back
audley court be not an attractive locality
the narrow passage lead us into a quadrangle pave with flag and line by sordid dwell
we pick our way among group of dirty children and through line of discolour linen until we come to number the door of which be decorate with a small slip of brass on which the name rance be engrave
on enquiry we find that the constable be in bed and we be show into a little front parlour to await his come
he appear presently look a little irritable at be disturb in his slumber
i make my report at the office he say
holmes take a half sovereign from his pocket and play with it pensively
we think that we should like to hear it all from your own lips he say
i shall be most happy to tell you anything i can the constable answer with his eye upon the little golden disk
just let us hear it all in your own way as it occur
rance sit down on the horsehair sofa and knit his brows as though determine not to omit anything in his narrative
i'll tell it ye from the begin he say
my time be from ten at night to six in the morning
at eleven there be a fight at the 'white hart' but bar that all be quiet enough on the beat
at one o'clock it begin to rain and i meet harry murcher him who have the holland grove beat and we stand together at the corner of henrietta street a talkin'
presently maybe about two or a little after i think i would take a look round and see that all be right down the brixton road
it be precious dirty and lonely
not a soul do i meet all the way down though a cab or two go past me
i be a strollin' down thinkin' between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be when suddenly the glint of a light catch my eye in the window of that same house
now i know that them two house in lauriston garden be empty on account of him that own them who won't have the drain see to though the very last tenant what live in one of them die o' typhoid fever
i be knock all in a heap therefore at see a light in the window and i suspect as something be wrong
when i get to the door you stop and then walk back to the garden gate my companion interrupt
what do you do that for
rance give a violent jump and star at sherlock holmes with the utmost amazement upon his feature
why that's true sir he say though how you come to know it heaven only know
ye see when i get up to the door it be so still and so lonesome that i think i'd be none the worse for some one with me
i ain't afeared of anything on this side o' the grave but i think that maybe it be him that die o' the typhoid inspect the drain what kill him
the think give me a kind o' turn and i walk back to the gate to see if i could see murcher's lantern but there wasn't no sign of him nor of anyone else
there be no one in the street
not a livin' soul sir nor as much as a dog
then i pull myself together and go back and push the door open
all be quiet inside so i go into the room where the light be a burnin'
there be a candle flickerin' on the mantelpiece a red wax one and by its light i saw yes i know all that you saw
you walk round the room several time and you kneel down by the body and then you walk through and try the kitchen door and then john rance spring to his feet with a frighten face and suspicion in his eye
where be you hide to see all that
he cry
it seem to me that you know a deal more than you should
holmes laugh and throw his card across the table to the constable
don't get arrest me for the murder he say
i be one of the hound and not the wolf mr
gregson or mr
lestrade will answer for that
go on though
what do you do next
rance resume his seat without however lose his mystify expression
i go back to the gate and sound my whistle
that bring murcher and two more to the spot
be the street empty then
well it be as far as anybody that could be of any good go
what do you mean
the constable's feature broaden into a grin
i've see many a drink chap in my time he say but never anyone so cryin' drink as that cove
he be at the gate when i come out a leanin' up agin the rail and a singin' at the pitch o' his lungs about columbine's new fangled banner or some such stuff
he couldn't stand far less help
what sort of a man be he
ask sherlock holmes
john rance appear to be somewhat irritate at this digression
he be an uncommon drink sort o' man he say
he'd ha' find hisself in the station if we hadn't be so take up
his face his dress didn't you notice them
holmes break in impatiently
i should think i do notice them see that i have to prop him up me and murcher between us
he be a long chap with a red face the lower part muffle round that will do cry holmes
what become of him
we'd enough to do without lookin' after him the policeman say in an aggrieve voice
i'll wager he find his way home all right
how be he dress
a brown overcoat
have he a whip in his hand
a whip no
he must have leave it behind mutter my companion
you didn't happen to see or hear a cab after that
no
there's a half sovereign for you my companion say stand up and take his hat
i be afraid rance that you will never rise in the force
that head of yours should be for use as well as ornament
you might have gain your sergeant's strip last night
the man whom you hold in your hand be the man who hold the clue of this mystery and whom we be seek
there be no use of argue about it now i tell you that it be so
come along doctor
we start off for the cab together leave our informant incredulous but obviously uncomfortable
the blunder fool holmes say bitterly as we drive back to our lodge
just to think of his have such an incomparable bite of good luck and not take advantage of it
i be rather in the dark still
it be true that the description of this man tally with your idea of the second party in this mystery
but why should he come back to the house after leave it
that be not the way of criminals
the ring man the ring that be what he come back for
if we have no other way of catch him we can always bait our line with the ring
i shall have him doctor i'll lay you two to one that i have him
i must thank you for it all
i might not have go but for you and so have miss the finest study i ever come across a study in scarlet eh
why shouldn't we use a little art jargon
there's the scarlet thread of murder run through the colourless skein of life and our duty be to unravel it and isolate it and expose every inch of it
and now for lunch and then for norman neruda
her attack and her bow be splendid
what's that little thing of chopin's she play so magnificently tra la la lira lira lay
lean back in the cab this amateur bloodhound carol away like a lark while i meditate upon the many sidedness of the human mind
our morning's exertions have be too much for my weak health and i be tire out in the afternoon
after holmes' departure for the concert i lay down upon the sofa and endeavour to get a couple of hours' sleep
it be a useless attempt
my mind have be too much excite by all that have occur and the strangest fancy and surmise crowd into it
every time that i close my eye i saw before me the distort baboon like countenance of the murder man
so sinister be the impression which that face have produce upon me that i find it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who have remove its owner from the world
if ever human feature bespeak vice of the most malignant type they be certainly those of enoch j drebber of cleveland
still i recognize that justice must be do and that the depravity of the victim be no condonment in the eye of the law
the more i think of it the more extraordinary do my companion's hypothesis that the man have be poison appear
i remember how he have sniff his lips and have no doubt that he have detect something which have give rise to the idea
then again if not poison what have cause the man's death since there be neither wind nor mark of strangulation
but on the other hand whose blood be that which lay so thickly upon the floor
there be no sign of a struggle nor have the victim any weapon with which he might have wound an antagonist
as long as all these question be unsolved i felt that sleep would be no easy matter either for holmes or myself
his quiet self confident manner convince me that he have already form a theory which explain all the facts though what it be i could not for an instant conjecture
he be very late in return so late that i know that the concert could not have detain him all the time
dinner be on the table before he appear
it be magnificent he say as he take his seat
do you remember what darwin say about music
he claim that the power of produce and appreciate it exist among the human race long before the power of speech be arrive at
perhaps that be why we be so subtly influence by it
there be vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world be in its childhood
that's rather a broad idea i remark
one's ideas must be as broad as nature if they be to interpret nature he answer
what's the matter
you're not look quite yourself
this brixton road affair have upset you
to tell the truth it have i say
i ought to be more case harden after my afghan experience
i saw my own comrades hack to piece at maiwand without lose my nerve
i can understand
there be a mystery about this which stimulate the imagination where there be no imagination there be no horror
have you see the even paper
no
it give a fairly good account of the affair
it do not mention the fact that when the man be raise up a woman's wed ring fell upon the floor
it be just as well it do not
why
look at this advertisement he answer
i have one send to every paper this morning immediately after the affair
he throw the paper across to me and i glance at the place indicate
it be the first announcement in the find column
in brixton road this morning it run a plain gold wed ring find in the roadway between the 'white hart' tavern and holland grove
apply dr
watson 221b baker street between eight and nine this even
excuse my use your name he say
if i use my own some of these dunderheads would recognize it and want to meddle in the affair
that be all right i answer
but suppose anyone apply i have no ring
oh yes you have say he hand me one
this will do very well
it be almost a facsimile
and who do you expect will answer this advertisement
why the man in the brown coat our florid friend with the square toe
if he do not come himself he will send an accomplice
would he not consider it as too dangerous
not at all
if my view of the case be correct and i have every reason to believe that it be this man would rather risk anything than lose the ring
accord to my notion he drop it while stoop over drebber's body and do not miss it at the time
after leave the house he discover his loss and hurry back but find the police already in possession owe to his own folly in leave the candle burn
he have to pretend to be drink in order to allay the suspicions which might have be arouse by his appearance at the gate
now put yourself in that man's place
on think the matter over it must have occur to him that it be possible that he have lose the ring in the road after leave the house
what would he do then
he would eagerly look out for the even paper in the hope of see it among the article find
his eye of course would light upon this
he would be overjoy
why should he fear a trap
there would be no reason in his eye why the find of the ring should be connect with the murder
he would come
he will come
you shall see him within an hour
and then
i ask
oh you can leave me to deal with him then
have you any arm
i have my old service revolver and a few cartridges
you have better clean it and load it
he will be a desperate man and though i shall take him unawares it be as well to be ready for anything
i go to my bedroom and follow his advice
when i return with the pistol the table have be clear and holmes be engage in his favourite occupation of scrap upon his violin
the plot thicken he say as i enter i have just have an answer to my american telegram
my view of the case be the correct one
and that be
i ask eagerly
my fiddle would be the better for new string he remark
put your pistol in your pocket
when the fellow come speak to him in an ordinary way
leave the rest to me
don't frighten him by look at him too hard
it be eight o'clock now i say glance at my watch
yes
he will probably be here in a few minutes
open the door slightly
that will do
now put the key on the inside
thank you
this be a queer old book i pick up at a stall yesterday 'de jure inter gentes' publish in latin at liege in the lowlands in
charles' head be still firm on his shoulder when this little brown back volume be strike off
who be the printer
philippe de croy whoever he may have be
on the fly leaf in very fade ink be write 'ex libris guliolmi whyte '
i wonder who william whyte be
some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer i suppose
his write have a legal twist about it
here come our man i think
as he speak there be a sharp ring at the bell
sherlock holmes rise softly and move his chair in the direction of the door
we hear the servant pass along the hall and the sharp click of the latch as she open it
do dr
watson live here
ask a clear but rather harsh voice
we could not hear the servant's reply but the door close and some one begin to ascend the stairs
the footfall be an uncertain and shuffle one
a look of surprise pass over the face of my companion as he listen to it
it come slowly along the passage and there be a feeble tap at the door
come in i cry
at my summon instead of the man of violence whom we expect a very old and wrinkle woman hobble into the apartment
she appear to be dazzle by the sudden blaze of light and after drop a curtsey she stand blink at us with her blear eye and fumble in her pocket with nervous shaky finger
i glance at my companion and his face have assume such a disconsolate expression that it be all i could do to keep my countenance
the old crone draw out an even paper and point at our advertisement
it's this as have bring me good gentlemen she say drop another curtsey a gold wed ring in the brixton road
it belong to my girl sally as be marry only this time twelvemonth which her husband be steward aboard a union boat and what he'd say if he come 'ome and find her without her ring be more than i can think he be short enough at the best o' time but more especially when he have the drink
if it please you she go to the circus last night along with be that her ring
i ask
the lord be thank
cry the old woman sally will be a glad woman this night
that's the ring
and what may your address be
i inquire take up a pencil
duncan street houndsditch
a weary way from here
the brixton road do not lie between any circus and houndsditch say sherlock holmes sharply
the old woman face round and look keenly at him from her little red rim eye
the gentleman ask me for _my_ address she say
sally live in lodge at mayfield place peckham
and your name be
my name be sawyer her's be dennis which tom dennis marry her and a smart clean lad too as long as he's at sea and no steward in the company more think of but when on shore what with the women and what with liquor shop here be your ring mrs
sawyer i interrupt in obedience to a sign from my companion it clearly belong to your daughter and i be glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner
with many mumble bless and protestations of gratitude the old crone pack it away in her pocket and shuffle off down the stairs
sherlock holmes spring to his feet the moment that she be go and rush into his room
he return in a few second envelop in an ulster and a cravat
i'll follow her he say hurriedly she must be an accomplice and will lead me to him
wait up for me
the hall door have hardly slam behind our visitor before holmes have descend the stair
look through the window i could see her walk feebly along the other side while her pursuer dog her some little distance behind
either his whole theory be incorrect i think to myself or else he will be lead now to the heart of the mystery
there be no need for him to ask me to wait up for him for i felt that sleep be impossible until i hear the result of his adventure
it be close upon nine when he set out
i have no idea how long he might be but i sit stolidly puff at my pipe and skip over the page of henri murger's vie de boheme
ten o'clock pass and i hear the footsteps of the maid as they patter off to bed
eleven and the more stately tread of the landlady pass my door bind for the same destination
it be close upon twelve before i hear the sharp sound of his latch key
the instant he enter i saw by his face that he have not be successful
amusement and chagrin seem to be struggle for the mastery until the former suddenly carry the day and he burst into a hearty laugh
i wouldn't have the scotland yarders know it for the world he cry drop into his chair i have chaff them so much that they would never have let me hear the end of it
i can afford to laugh because i know that i will be even with them in the long run
what be it then
i ask
oh i don't mind tell a story against myself
that creature have go a little way when she begin to limp and show every sign of be foot sore
presently she come to a halt and hail a four wheeler which be pass
i manage to be close to her so as to hear the address but i need not have be so anxious for she sing it out loud enough to be hear at the other side of the street 'drive to duncan street houndsditch ' she cry
this begin to look genuine i think and have see her safely inside i perch myself behind
that's an art which every detective should be an expert at
well away we rattle and never draw rein until we reach the street in question
i hop off before we come to the door and stroll down the street in an easy lounge way
i saw the cab pull up
the driver jump down and i saw him open the door and stand expectantly
nothing come out though
when i reach him he be grope about frantically in the empty cab and give vent to the finest assort collection of oaths that ever i listen to
there be no sign or trace of his passenger and i fear it will be some time before he get his fare
on inquire at number we find that the house belong to a respectable paperhanger name keswick and that no one of the name either of sawyer or dennis have ever be hear of there
you don't mean to say i cry in amazement that that totter feeble old woman be able to get out of the cab while it be in motion without either you or the driver see her
old woman be damn
say sherlock holmes sharply
we be the old women to be so take in
it must have be a young man and an active one too besides be an incomparable actor
the get up be inimitable
he saw that he be follow no doubt and use this mean of give me the slip
it show that the man we be after be not as lonely as i imagine he be but have friends who be ready to risk something for him
now doctor you be look do up
take my advice and turn in
i be certainly feel very weary so i obey his injunction
i leave holmes seat in front of the smoulder fire and long into the watch of the night i hear the low melancholy wail of his violin and know that he be still ponder over the strange problem which he have set himself to unravel
the paper next day be full of the brixton mystery as they term it
each have a long account of the affair and some have leaders upon it in addition
there be some information in them which be new to me
i still retain in my scrap book numerous clippings and extract bear upon the case
here be a condensation of a few of them the _daily telegraph_ remark that in the history of crime there have seldom be a tragedy which present stranger feature
the german name of the victim the absence of all other motive and the sinister inscription on the wall all point to its perpetration by political refugees and revolutionists
the socialists have many branch in america and the decease have no doubt infringe their unwritten laws and be track down by them
after allude airily to the vehmgericht aqua tofana carbonari the marchioness de brinvilliers the darwinian theory the principles of malthus and the ratcliff highway murder the article conclude by admonish the government and advocate a closer watch over foreigners in england
the _standard_ comment upon the fact that lawless outrage of the sort usually occur under a liberal administration
they arise from the unsettle of the mind of the mass and the consequent weaken of all authority
the decease be an american gentleman who have be reside for some weeks in the metropolis
he have stay at the board house of madame charpentier in torquay terrace camberwell
he be accompany in his travel by his private secretary mr
joseph stangerson
the two bid adieu to their landlady upon tuesday the 4th inst and depart to euston station with the avow intention of catch the liverpool express
they be afterwards see together upon the platform
nothing more be know of them until mr
drebber's body be as record discover in an empty house in the brixton road many miles from euston
how he come there or how he meet his fate be question which be still involve in mystery
nothing be know of the whereabouts of stangerson
we be glad to learn that mr
lestrade and mr
gregson of scotland yard be both engage upon the case and it be confidently anticipate that these well know officer will speedily throw light upon the matter
the _daily news_ observe that there be no doubt as to the crime be a political one
the despotism and hatred of liberalism which animate the continental governments have have the effect of drive to our shore a number of men who might have make excellent citizens be they not sour by the recollection of all that they have undergo
among these men there be a stringent code of honour any infringement of which be punish by death
every effort should be make to find the secretary stangerson and to ascertain some particulars of the habit of the decease
a great step have be gain by the discovery of the address of the house at which he have board a result which be entirely due to the acuteness and energy of mr
gregson of scotland yard
sherlock holmes and i read these notice over together at breakfast and they appear to afford him considerable amusement
i tell you that whatever happen lestrade and gregson would be sure to score
that depend on how it turn out
oh bless you it doesn't matter in the least
if the man be catch it will be _on account_ of their exertions if he escape it will be _in spite_ of their exertions
it's head i win and tail you lose
whatever they do they will have followers
'un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui l'admire '
what on earth be this
i cry for at this moment there come the patter of many step in the hall and on the stairs accompany by audible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady
it's the baker street division of the detective police force say my companion gravely and as he speak there rush into the room half a dozen of the dirtiest and most rag street arabs that ever i clap eye on
'tention
cry holmes in a sharp tone and the six dirty little scoundrels stand in a line like so many disreputable statuettes
in future you shall send up wiggins alone to report and the rest of you must wait in the street
have you find it wiggins
no sir we hain't say one of the youths
i hardly expect you would
you must keep on until you do
here be your wag
he hand each of them a shill
now off you go and come back with a better report next time
he wave his hand and they scamper away downstairs like so many rat and we hear their shrill voice next moment in the street
there's more work to be get out of one of those little beggar than out of a dozen of the force holmes remark
the mere sight of an official look person seal men's lips
these youngsters however go everywhere and hear everything
they be as sharp as needle too all they want be organisation
be it on this brixton case that you be employ them
i ask
yes there be a point which i wish to ascertain
it be merely a matter of time
hullo
we be go to hear some news now with a vengeance
here be gregson come down the road with beatitude write upon every feature of his face
bind for us i know
yes he be stop
there he be
there be a violent peal at the bell and in a few second the fair haired detective come up the stairs three step at a time and burst into our sit room
my dear fellow he cry wring holmes' unresponsive hand congratulate me
i have make the whole thing as clear as day
a shade of anxiety seem to me to cross my companion's expressive face
do you mean that you be on the right track
he ask
the right track
why sir we have the man under lock and key
and his name be
arthur charpentier sub lieutenant in her majesty's navy cry gregson pompously rub his fat hand and inflate his chest
sherlock holmes give a sigh of relief and relax into a smile
take a seat and try one of these cigars he say
we be anxious to know how you manage it
will you have some whiskey and water
i don't mind if i do the detective answer
the tremendous exertions which i have go through during the last day or two have wear me out
not so much bodily exertion you understand as the strain upon the mind
you will appreciate that mr
sherlock holmes for we be both brain workers
you do me too much honour say holmes gravely
let us hear how you arrive at this most gratify result
the detective seat himself in the arm chair and puff complacently at his cigar
then suddenly he slap his thigh in a paroxysm of amusement
the fun of it be he cry that that fool lestrade who think himself so smart have go off upon the wrong track altogether
he be after the secretary stangerson who have no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn
i have no doubt that he have catch him by this time
the idea tickle gregson so much that he laugh until he choke
and how do you get your clue
ah i'll tell you all about it
of course doctor watson this be strictly between ourselves
the first difficulty which we have to contend with be the find of this american's antecedents
some people would have wait until their advertisements be answer or until party come forward and volunteer information
that be not tobias gregson's way of go to work
you remember the hat beside the dead man
yes say holmes by john underwood and sons camberwell road
gregson look quite crest fall
i have no idea that you notice that he say
have you be there
no
ha
cry gregson in a relieve voice you should never neglect a chance however small it may seem
to a great mind nothing be little remark holmes sententiously
well i go to underwood and ask him if he have sell a hat of that size and description
he look over his book and come on it at once
he have send the hat to a mr
drebber reside at charpentier's board establishment torquay terrace
thus i get at his address
smart very smart
murmur sherlock holmes
i next call upon madame charpentier continue the detective
i find her very pale and distress
her daughter be in the room too an uncommonly fine girl she be too she be look red about the eye and her lips tremble as i speak to her
that didn't escape my notice
i begin to smell a rat
you know the feel mr
sherlock holmes when you come upon the right scent a kind of thrill in your nerve
'have you hear of the mysterious death of your late boarder mr
enoch j drebber of cleveland '
i ask
the mother nod
she didn't seem able to get out a word
the daughter burst into tear
i felt more than ever that these people know something of the matter
'at what o'clock do mr
drebber leave your house for the train '
i ask
'at eight o'clock ' she say gulp in her throat to keep down her agitation
'his secretary mr
stangerson say that there be two train one at and one at
he be to catch the first
'and be that the last which you saw of him '
a terrible change come over the woman's face as i ask the question
her feature turn perfectly livid
it be some second before she could get out the single word 'yes' and when it do come it be in a husky unnatural tone
there be silence for a moment and then the daughter speak in a calm clear voice
'no good can ever come of falsehood mother ' she say
'let us be frank with this gentleman
we _did_ see mr
drebber again '
'god forgive you '
cry madame charpentier throw up her hand and sink back in her chair
'you have murder your brother '
'arthur would rather that we speak the truth ' the girl answer firmly
'you have best tell me all about it now ' i say
'half confidences be worse than none
besides you do not know how much we know of it '
'on your head be it alice '
cry her mother and then turn to me 'i will tell you all sir
do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son arise from any fear lest he should have have a hand in this terrible affair
he be utterly innocent of it
my dread be however that in your eye and in the eye of others he may appear to be compromise
that however be surely impossible
his high character his profession his antecedents would all forbid it '
'your best way be to make a clean breast of the facts ' i answer
'depend upon it if your son be innocent he will be none the worse '
'perhaps alice you have better leave us together ' she say and her daughter withdraw
'now sir ' she continue 'i have no intention of tell you all this but since my poor daughter have disclose it i have no alternative
have once decide to speak i will tell you all without omit any particular '
'it be your wisest course ' say i
'mr
drebber have be with us nearly three weeks
he and his secretary mr
stangerson have be travel on the continent
i notice a copenhagen label upon each of their trunks show that that have be their last stop place
stangerson be a quiet reserve man but his employer i be sorry to say be far otherwise
he be coarse in his habit and brutish in his ways
the very night of his arrival he become very much the worse for drink and indeed after twelve o'clock in the day he could hardly ever be say to be sober
his manners towards the maid servants be disgustingly free and familiar
worst of all he speedily assume the same attitude towards my daughter alice and speak to her more than once in a way which fortunately she be too innocent to understand
on one occasion he actually seize her in his arm and embrace her an outrage which cause his own secretary to reproach him for his unmanly conduct '
'but why do you stand all this ' i ask
'i suppose that you can get rid of your boarders when you wish '
mrs
charpentier blush at my pertinent question
'would to god that i have give him notice on the very day that he come ' she say
'but it be a sore temptation
they be pay a pound a day each fourteen pound a week and this be the slack season
i be a widow and my boy in the navy have cost me much
i grudge to lose the money
i act for the best
this last be too much however and i give him notice to leave on account of it
that be the reason of his go '
'well '
'my heart grow light when i saw him drive away
my son be on leave just now but i do not tell him anything of all this for his temper be violent and he be passionately fond of his sister
when i close the door behind them a load seem to be lift from my mind
alas in less than an hour there be a ring at the bell and i learn that mr
drebber have return
he be much excite and evidently the worse for drink
he force his way into the room where i be sit with my daughter and make some incoherent remark about have miss his train
he then turn to alice and before my very face propose to her that she should fly with him
you be of age he say and there be no law to stop you
i have money enough and to spare
never mind the old girl here but come along with me now straight away
you shall live like a princess
poor alice be so frighten that she shrink away from him but he catch her by the wrist and endeavour to draw her towards the door
i scream and at that moment my son arthur come into the room
what happen then i do not know
i hear oaths and the confuse sound of a scuffle
i be too terrify to raise my head
when i do look up i saw arthur stand in the doorway laugh with a stick in his hand
i don't think that fine fellow will trouble us again he say
i will just go after him and see what he do with himself
with those word he take his hat and start off down the street
the next morning we hear of mr
drebber's mysterious death '
this statement come from mrs
charpentier's lips with many gasp and pause
at time she speak so low that i could hardly catch the word
i make shorthand note of all that she say however so that there should be no possibility of a mistake
it's quite excite say sherlock holmes with a yawn
what happen next
when mrs
charpentier pause the detective continue i saw that the whole case hang upon one point
fix her with my eye in a way which i always find effective with women i ask her at what hour her son return
'i do not know ' she answer
'not know '
'no he have a latch key and he let himself in '
'after you go to bed '
'yes '
'when do you go to bed '
'about eleven '
'so your son be go at least two hours '
'yes '
'possibly four or five '
'yes '
'what be he do during that time '
'i do not know ' she answer turn white to her very lips
of course after that there be nothing more to be do
i find out where lieutenant charpentier be take two officer with me and arrest him
when i touch him on the shoulder and warn him to come quietly with us he answer us as bold as brass 'i suppose you be arrest me for be concern in the death of that scoundrel drebber ' he say
we have say nothing to him about it so that his allude to it have a most suspicious aspect
very say holmes
he still carry the heavy stick which the mother describe him as have with him when he follow drebber
it be a stout oak cudgel
what be your theory then
well my theory be that he follow drebber as far as the brixton road
when there a fresh altercation arise between them in the course of which drebber receive a blow from the stick in the pit of the stomach perhaps which kill him without leave any mark
the night be so wet that no one be about so charpentier drag the body of his victim into the empty house
as to the candle and the blood and the write on the wall and the ring they may all be so many trick to throw the police on to the wrong scent
well do
say holmes in an encourage voice
really gregson you be get along
we shall make something of you yet
i flatter myself that i have manage it rather neatly the detective answer proudly
the young man volunteer a statement in which he say that after follow drebber some time the latter perceive him and take a cab in order to get away from him
on his way home he meet an old shipmate and take a long walk with him
on be ask where this old shipmate live he be unable to give any satisfactory reply
i think the whole case fit together uncommonly well
what amuse me be to think of lestrade who have start off upon the wrong scent
i be afraid he won't make much of why by jove here's the very man himself
it be indeed lestrade who have ascend the stairs while we be talk and who now enter the room
the assurance and jauntiness which generally mark his demeanour and dress be however want
his face be disturb and trouble while his clothe be disarrange and untidy
he have evidently come with the intention of consult with sherlock holmes for on perceive his colleague he appear to be embarrass and put out
he stand in the centre of the room fumble nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do
this be a most extraordinary case he say at last a most incomprehensible affair
ah you find it so mr
lestrade
cry gregson triumphantly
i think you would come to that conclusion
have you manage to find the secretary mr
joseph stangerson
the secretary mr
joseph stangerson say lestrade gravely be murder at halliday's private hotel about six o'clock this morning
the intelligence with which lestrade greet us be so momentous and so unexpected that we be all three fairly dumfoundered
gregson spring out of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water
i star in silence at sherlock holmes whose lips be compress and his brows draw down over his eye
stangerson too
he mutter
the plot thicken
it be quite thick enough before grumble lestrade take a chair
i seem to have drop into a sort of council of war
be you be you sure of this piece of intelligence
stammer gregson
i have just come from his room say lestrade
i be the first to discover what have occur
we have be hear gregson's view of the matter holmes observe
would you mind let us know what you have see and do
i have no objection lestrade answer seat himself
i freely confess that i be of the opinion that stangerson be concern in the death of drebber
this fresh development have show me that i be completely mistake
full of the one idea i set myself to find out what have become of the secretary
they have be see together at euston station about half past eight on the even of the third
at two in the morning drebber have be find in the brixton road
the question which confront me be to find out how stangerson have be employ between and the time of the crime and what have become of him afterwards
i telegraph to liverpool give a description of the man and warn them to keep a watch upon the american boat
i then set to work call upon all the hotels and lodge house in the vicinity of euston
you see i argue that if drebber and his companion have become separate the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night and then to hang about the station again next morning
they would be likely to agree on some meet place beforehand remark holmes
so it prove
i spend the whole of yesterday even in make enquiries entirely without avail
this morning i begin very early and at eight o'clock i reach halliday's private hotel in little george street
on my enquiry as to whether a mr
stangerson be live there they at once answer me in the affirmative
'no doubt you be the gentleman whom he be expect ' they say
'he have be wait for a gentleman for two days '
'where be he now '
i ask
'he be upstairs in bed
he wish to be call at nine '
'i will go up and see him at once ' i say
it seem to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerve and lead him to say something unguarded
the boot volunteer to show me the room it be on the second floor and there be a small corridor lead up to it
the boot point out the door to me and be about to go downstairs again when i saw something that make me feel sickish in spite of my twenty years' experience
from under the door there curl a little red ribbon of blood which have meander across the passage and form a little pool along the skirt at the other side
i give a cry which bring the boot back
he nearly faint when he saw it
the door be lock on the inside but we put our shoulder to it and knock it in
the window of the room be open and beside the window all huddle up lay the body of a man in his nightdress
he be quite dead and have be for some time for his limbs be rigid and cold
when we turn him over the boot recognize him at once as be the same gentleman who have engage the room under the name of joseph stangerson
the cause of death be a deep stab in the leave side which must have penetrate the heart
and now come the strangest part of the affair
what do you suppose be above the murder man
i felt a creep of the flesh and a presentiment of come horror even before sherlock holmes answer
the word rache write in letter of blood he say
that be it say lestrade in an awe strike voice and we be all silent for a while
there be something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin that it impart a fresh ghastliness to his crimes
my nerve which be steady enough on the field of battle tingle as i think of it
the man be see continue lestrade
a milk boy pass on his way to the dairy happen to walk down the lane which lead from the mew at the back of the hotel
he notice that a ladder which usually lay there be raise against one of the windows of the second floor which be wide open
after pass he look back and saw a man descend the ladder
he come down so quietly and openly that the boy imagine him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel
he take no particular notice of him beyond think in his own mind that it be early for him to be at work
he have an impression that the man be tall have a reddish face and be dress in a long brownish coat
he must have stay in the room some little time after the murder for we find blood stain water in the basin where he have wash his hand and mark on the sheet where he have deliberately wipe his knife
i glance at holmes on hear the description of the murderer which tally so exactly with his own
there be however no trace of exultation or satisfaction upon his face
do you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer
he ask
nothing
stangerson have drebber's purse in his pocket but it seem that this be usual as he do all the pay
there be eighty odd pound in it but nothing have be take
whatever the motives of these extraordinary crimes robbery be certainly not one of them
there be no paper or memoranda in the murder man's pocket except a single telegram date from cleveland about a month ago and contain the word 'j
h be in europe '
there be no name append to this message
and there be nothing else
holmes ask
nothing of any importance
the man's novel with which he have read himself to sleep be lie upon the bed and his pipe be on a chair beside him
there be a glass of water on the table and on the window sill a small chip ointment box contain a couple of pills
sherlock holmes spring from his chair with an exclamation of delight
the last link he cry exultantly
my case be complete
the two detectives star at him in amazement
i have now in my hand my companion say confidently all the thread which have form such a tangle
there be of course detail to be fill in but i be as certain of all the main facts from the time that drebber part from stangerson at the station up to the discovery of the body of the latter as if i have see them with my own eye
i will give you a proof of my knowledge
could you lay your hand upon those pills
i have them say lestrade produce a small white box i take them and the purse and the telegram intend to have them put in a place of safety at the police station
it be the merest chance my take these pills for i be bind to say that i do not attach any importance to them
give them here say holmes
now doctor turn to me be those ordinary pills
they certainly be not
they be of a pearly grey colour small round and almost transparent against the light
from their lightness and transparency i should imagine that they be soluble in water i remark
precisely so answer holmes
now would you mind go down and fetch that poor little devil of a terrier which have be bad so long and which the landlady want you to put out of its pain yesterday
i go downstairs and carry the dog upstair in my arm
it's labour breathe and glaze eye show that it be not far from its end
indeed its snow white muzzle proclaim that it have already exceed the usual term of canine existence
i place it upon a cushion on the rug
i will now cut one of these pills in two say holmes and draw his penknife he suit the action to the word
one half we return into the box for future purpose
the other half i will place in this wine glass in which be a teaspoonful of water
you perceive that our friend the doctor be right and that it readily dissolve
this may be very interest say lestrade in the injure tone of one who suspect that he be be laugh at i cannot see however what it have to do with the death of mr
joseph stangerson
patience my friend patience
you will find in time that it have everything to do with it
i shall now add a little milk to make the mixture palatable and on present it to the dog we find that he lap it up readily enough
as he speak he turn the content of the wine glass into a saucer and place it in front of the terrier who speedily lick it dry
sherlock holmes' earnest demeanour have so far convince us that we all sit in silence watch the animal intently and expect some startle effect
none such appear however
the dog continue to lie stretch upon tho cushion breathe in a labour way but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught
holmes have take out his watch and as minute follow minute without result an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appear upon his feature
he gnaw his lip drum his finger upon the table and show every other symptom of acute impatience
so great be his emotion that i felt sincerely sorry for him while the two detectives smile derisively by no mean displease at this check which he have meet
it can't be a coincidence he cry at last spring from his chair and pace wildly up and down the room it be impossible that it should be a mere coincidence
the very pills which i suspect in the case of drebber be actually find after the death of stangerson
and yet they be inert
what can it mean
surely my whole chain of reason cannot have be false
it be impossible
and yet this wretched dog be none the worse
ah i have it
i have it
with a perfect shriek of delight he rush to the box cut the other pill in two dissolve it add milk and present it to the terrier
the unfortunate creature's tongue seem hardly to have be moisten in it before it give a convulsive shiver in every limb and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it have be strike by lightning
sherlock holmes draw a long breath and wipe the perspiration from his forehead
i should have more faith he say i ought to know by this time that when a fact appear to be oppose to a long train of deductions it invariably prove to be capable of bear some other interpretation
of the two pills in that box one be of the most deadly poison and the other be entirely harmless
i ought to have know that before ever i saw the box at all
this last statement appear to me to be so startle that i could hardly believe that he be in his sober sense
there be the dead dog however to prove that his conjecture have be correct
it seem to me that the mist in my own mind be gradually clear away and i begin to have a dim vague perception of the truth
all this seem strange to you continue holmes because you fail at the begin of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which be present to you
i have the good fortune to seize upon that and everything which have occur since then have serve to confirm my original supposition and indeed be the logical sequence of it
hence things which have perplex you and make the case more obscure have serve to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions
it be a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery
the most commonplace crime be often the most mysterious because it present no new or special feature from which deductions may be draw
this murder would have be infinitely more difficult to unravel have the body of the victim be simply find lie in the roadway without any of those _outre_ and sensational accompaniments which have render it remarkable
these strange detail far from make the case more difficult have really have the effect of make it less so
mr
gregson who have listen to this address with considerable impatience could contain himself no longer
look here mr
sherlock holmes he say we be all ready to acknowledge that you be a smart man and that you have your own methods of work
we want something more than mere theory and preach now though
it be a case of take the man
i have make my case out and it seem i be wrong
young charpentier could not have be engage in this second affair
lestrade go after his man stangerson and it appear that he be wrong too
you have throw out hint here and hint there and seem to know more than we do but the time have come when we feel that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the business
can you name the man who do it
i cannot help feel that gregson be right sir remark lestrade
we have both try and we have both fail
you have remark more than once since i have be in the room that you have all the evidence which you require
surely you will not withhold it any longer
any delay in arrest the assassin i observe might give him time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity
thus press by us all holmes show sign of irresolution
he continue to walk up and down the room with his head sink on his chest and his brows draw down as be his habit when lose in think
there will be no more murder he say at last stop abruptly and face us
you can put that consideration out of the question
you have ask me if i know the name of the assassin
i do
the mere know of his name be a small thing however compare with the power of lay our hand upon him
this i expect very shortly to do
i have good hop of manage it through my own arrangements but it be a thing which need delicate handle for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal with who be support as i have have occasion to prove by another who be as clever as himself
as long as this man have no idea that anyone can have a clue there be some chance of secure him but if he have the slightest suspicion he would change his name and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city
without mean to hurt either of your feel i be bind to say that i consider these men to be more than a match for the official force and that be why i have not ask your assistance
if i fail i shall of course incur all the blame due to this omission but that i be prepare for
at present i be ready to promise that the instant that i can communicate with you without endanger my own combinations i shall do so
gregson and lestrade seem to be far from satisfy by this assurance or by the depreciate allusion to the detective police
the former have flush up to the root of his flaxen hair while the other's beady eye glisten with curiosity and resentment
neither of them have time to speak however before there be a tap at the door and the spokesman of the street arabs young wiggins introduce his insignificant and unsavoury person
please sir he say touch his forelock i have the cab downstairs
good boy say holmes blandly
why don't you introduce this pattern at scotland yard
he continue take a pair of steel handcuff from a drawer
see how beautifully the spring work
they fasten in an instant
the old pattern be good enough remark lestrade if we can only find the man to put them on
very good very good say holmes smile
the cabman may as well help me with my box
just ask him to step up wiggins
i be surprise to find my companion speak as though he be about to set out on a journey since he have not say anything to me about it
there be a small portmanteau in the room and this he pull out and begin to strap
he be busily engage at it when the cabman enter the room
just give me a help with this buckle cabman he say kneel over his task and never turn his head
the fellow come forward with a somewhat sullen defiant air and put down his hand to assist
at that instant there be a sharp click the jangle of metal and sherlock holmes spring to his feet again
gentlemen he cry with flash eye let me introduce you to mr
jefferson hope the murderer of enoch drebber and of joseph stangerson
the whole thing occur in a moment so quickly that i have no time to realize it
i have a vivid recollection of that instant of holmes' triumphant expression and the ring of his voice of the cabman's daze savage face as he glare at the glitter handcuff which have appear as if by magic upon his wrists
for a second or two we might have be a group of statues
then with an inarticulate roar of fury the prisoner wrench himself free from holmes's grasp and hurl himself through the window
woodwork and glass give way before him but before he get quite through gregson lestrade and holmes spring upon him like so many staghounds
he be drag back into the room and then commence a terrific conflict
so powerful and so fierce be he that the four of us be shake off again and again
he appear to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit
his face and hand be terribly mangle by his passage through the glass but loss of blood have no effect in diminish his resistance
it be not until lestrade succeed in get his hand inside his neckcloth and half strangle him that we make him realize that his struggle be of no avail and even then we felt no security until we have pinion his feet as well as his hand
that do we rise to our feet breathless and pant
we have his cab say sherlock holmes
it will serve to take him to scotland yard
and now gentlemen he continue with a pleasant smile we have reach the end of our little mystery
you be very welcome to put any question that you like to me now and there be no danger that i will refuse to answer them
in the central portion of the great north american continent there lie an arid and repulsive desert which for many a long year serve as a barrier against the advance of civilisation
from the sierra nevada to nebraska and from the yellowstone river in the north to the colorado upon the south be a region of desolation and silence
nor be nature always in one mood throughout this grim district
it comprise snow cap and lofty mountains and dark and gloomy valleys
there be swift flow rivers which dash through jag canons and there be enormous plain which in winter be white with snow and in summer be grey with the saline alkali dust
they all preserve however the common characteristics of barrenness inhospitality and misery
there be no inhabitants of this land of despair
a band of pawnees or of blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other hunt ground but the hardiest of the brave be glad to lose sight of those awesome plain and to find themselves once more upon their prairies
the coyote skulk among the scrub the buzzard flap heavily through the air and the clumsy grizzly bear lumber through the dark ravines and pick up such sustenance as it can amongst the rock
these be the sole dwellers in the wilderness
in the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the sierra blanco
as far as the eye can reach stretch the great flat plain land all dust over with patch of alkali and intersect by clump of the dwarfish chaparral bush
on the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peak with their rugged summit fleck with snow
in this great stretch of country there be no sign of life nor of anything appertain to life
there be no bird in the steel blue heaven no movement upon the dull grey earth above all there be absolute silence
listen as one may there be no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness nothing but silence complete and heart subdue silence
it have be say there be nothing appertain to life upon the broad plain
that be hardly true
look down from the sierra blanco one see a pathway trace out across the desert which wind away and be lose in the extreme distance
it be rut with wheel and tread down by the feet of many adventurers
here and there there be scatter white object which glisten in the sun and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali
approach and examine them
they be bone some large and coarse others smaller and more delicate
the former have belong to oxen and the latter to men
for fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scatter remain of those who have fall by the wayside
look down on this very scene there stand upon the fourth of may eighteen hundred and forty seven a solitary traveller
his appearance be such that he might have be the very genius or demon of the region
an observer would have find it difficult to say whether he be nearer to forty or to sixty
his face be lean and haggard and the brown parchment like skin be draw tightly over the project bone his long brown hair and beard be all fleck and dash with white his eye be sink in his head and burn with an unnatural lustre while the hand which grasp his rifle be hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton
as he stand he lean upon his weapon for support and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bone suggest a wiry and vigorous constitution
his gaunt face however and his clothe which hang so baggily over his shrivel limbs proclaim what it be that give him that senile and decrepit appearance
the man be die die from hunger and from thirst
he have toil painfully down the ravine and on to this little elevation in the vain hope of see some sign of water
now the great salt plain stretch before his eye and the distant belt of savage mountains without a sign anywhere of plant or tree which might indicate the presence of moisture
in all that broad landscape there be no gleam of hope
north and east and west he look with wild question eye and then he realise that his wander have come to an end and that there on that barren crag he be about to die
why not here as well as in a feather bed twenty years hence he mutter as he seat himself in the shelter of a boulder
before sit down he have deposit upon the grind his useless rifle and also a large bundle tie up in a grey shawl which he have carry sling over his right shoulder
it appear to be somewhat too heavy for his strength for in lower it it come down on the grind with some little violence
instantly there break from the grey parcel a little moan cry and from it there protrude a small scar face with very bright brown eye and two little speckle dimple fists
you've hurt me
say a childish voice reproachfully
have i though the man answer penitently i didn't go for to do it
as he speak he unwrap the grey shawl and extricate a pretty little girl of about five years of age whose dainty shoe and smart pink frock with its little linen apron all bespeak a mother's care
the child be pale and wan but her healthy arm and legs show that she have suffer less than her companion
how be it now
he answer anxiously for she be still rub the towsy golden curl which cover the back of her head
kiss it and make it well she say with perfect gravity shove the injure part up to him
that's what mother use to do
where's mother
mother's go
i guess you'll see her before long
go eh
say the little girl
funny she didn't say good bye she 'most always do if she be just goin' over to auntie's for tea and now she's be away three days
say it's awful dry ain't it
ain't there no water nor nothing to eat
no there ain't nothing dearie
you'll just need to be patient awhile and then you'll be all right
put your head up agin me like that and then you'll feel bullier
it ain't easy to talk when your lips be like leather but i guess i'd best let you know how the card lie
what's that you've get
pretty things
fine things
cry the little girl enthusiastically hold up two glitter fragment of mica
when we go back to home i'll give them to brother bob
you'll see prettier things than them soon say the man confidently
you just wait a bite
i be go to tell you though you remember when we leave the river
oh yes
well we reckon we'd strike another river soon d'ye see
but there be somethin' wrong compass or map or somethin' and it didn't turn up
water run out
just except a little drop for the like of you and and and you couldn't wash yourself interrupt his companion gravely star up at his grimy visage
no nor drink
and mr
bender he be the fust to go and then indian pete and then mrs
mcgregor and then johnny hone and then dearie your mother
then mother's a deader too cry the little girl drop her face in her pinafore and sob bitterly
yes they all go except you and me
then i think there be some chance of water in this direction so i heave you over my shoulder and we tramp it together
it don't seem as though we've improve matter
there's an almighty small chance for us now
do you mean that we be go to die too
ask the child check her sob and raise her tear stain face
i guess that's about the size of it
why didn't you say so before
she say laugh gleefully
you give me such a fright
why of course now as long as we die we'll be with mother again
yes you will dearie
and you too
i'll tell her how awful good you've be
i'll bet she meet us at the door of heaven with a big pitcher of water and a lot of buckwheat cake hot and toast on both side like bob and me be fond of
how long will it be first
i don't know not very long
the man's eye be fix upon the northern horizon
in the blue vault of the heaven there have appear three little speck which increase in size every moment so rapidly do they approach
they speedily resolve themselves into three large brown bird which circle over the head of the two wanderers and then settle upon some rock which overlook them
they be buzzards the vultures of the west whose come be the forerunner of death
cock and hens cry the little girl gleefully point at their ill omen form and clap her hand to make them rise
say do god make this country
in course he do say her companion rather startle by this unexpected question
he make the country down in illinois and he make the missouri the little girl continue
i guess somebody else make the country in these part
it's not nearly so well do
they forget the water and the tree
what would ye think of offer up prayer
the man ask diffidently
it ain't night yet she answer
it don't matter
it ain't quite regular but he won't mind that you bet
you say over them ones that you use to say every night in the waggon when we be on the plain
why don't you say some yourself
the child ask with wonder eye
i disremember them he answer
i hain't say none since i be half the height o' that gun
i guess it's never too late
you say them out and i'll stand by and come in on the chorus
then you'll need to kneel down and me too she say lay the shawl out for that purpose
you've get to put your hand up like this
it make you feel kind o' good
it be a strange sight have there be anything but the buzzards to see it
side by side on the narrow shawl kneel the two wanderers the little prattle child and the reckless harden adventurer
her chubby face and his haggard angular visage be both turn up to the cloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread be with whom they be face to face while the two voice the one thin and clear the other deep and harsh unite in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness
the prayer finish they resume their seat in the shadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep nestle upon the broad breast of her protector
he watch over her slumber for some time but nature prove to be too strong for him
for three days and three nights he have allow himself neither rest nor repose
slowly the eyelids droop over the tire eye and the head sink lower and lower upon the breast until the man's grizzle beard be mix with the gold tresses of his companion and both sleep the same deep and dreamless slumber
have the wanderer remain awake for another half hour a strange sight would have meet his eye
far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain there rise up a little spray of dust very slight at first and hardly to be distinguish from the mist of the distance but gradually grow higher and broader until it form a solid well define cloud
this cloud continue to increase in size until it become evident that it could only be raise by a great multitude of move creatures
in more fertile spot the observer would have come to the conclusion that one of those great herd of bisons which graze upon the prairie land be approach him
this be obviously impossible in these arid wilds
as the whirl of dust draw nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways be repose the canvas cover tilt of waggons and the figure of arm horsemen begin to show up through the haze and the apparition reveal itself as be a great caravan upon its journey for the west
but what a caravan
when the head of it have reach the base of the mountains the rear be not yet visible on the horizon
right across the enormous plain stretch the straggle array waggons and cart men on horseback and men on foot
innumerable women who stagger along under burden and children who toddle beside the waggons or peep out from under the white cover
this be evidently no ordinary party of immigrants but rather some nomad people who have be compel from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new country
there rise through the clear air a confuse clatter and rumble from this great mass of humanity with the creak of wheel and the neigh of horse
loud as it be it be not sufficient to rouse the two tire wayfarers above them
at the head of the column there ride a score or more of grave ironfaced men clothe in sombre homespun garment and arm with rifle
on reach the base of the bluff they halt and hold a short council among themselves
the well be to the right my brothers say one a hard lipped clean shave man with grizzly hair
to the right of the sierra blanco so we shall reach the rio grande say another
fear not for water cry a third
he who could draw it from the rock will not now abandon his own choose people
amen
amen
respond the whole party
they be about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and keenest eye utter an exclamation and point up at the rugged crag above them
from its summit there flutter a little wisp of pink show up hard and bright against the grey rock behind
at the sight there be a general rein up of horse and unslinging of gun while fresh horsemen come gallop up to reinforce the vanguard
the word 'redskins' be on every lip
there can't be any number of injuns here say the elderly man who appear to be in command
we have pass the pawnees and there be no other tribes until we cross the great mountains
shall i go forward and see brother stangerson ask one of the band
and i and i cry a dozen voice
leave your horse below and we will await you here the elder answer
in a moment the young fellows have dismount fasten their horse and be ascend the precipitous slope which lead up to the object which have excite their curiosity
they advance rapidly and noiselessly with the confidence and dexterity of practise scout
the watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock until their figure stand out against the skyline
the young man who have first give the alarm be lead them
suddenly his followers saw him throw up his hand as though overcome with astonishment and on join him they be affect in the same way by the sight which meet their eye
on the little plateau which crown the barren hill there stand a single giant boulder and against this boulder there lay a tall man long beard and hard feature but of an excessive thinness
his placid face and regular breathe show that he be fast asleep
beside him lay a little child with her round white arm encircle his brown sinewy neck and her golden haired head rest upon the breast of his velveteen tunic
her rosy lips be part show the regular line of snow white teeth within and a playful smile play over her infantile feature
her plump little white legs terminate in white sock and neat shoe with shin buckle offer a strange contrast to the long shrivel members of her companion
on the ledge of rock above this strange couple there stand three solemn buzzards who at the sight of the new comers utter raucous scream of disappointment and flap sullenly away
the cry of the foul bird awake the two sleepers who star about them in bewilderment
the man stagger to his feet and look down upon the plain which have be so desolate when sleep have overtake him and which be now traverse by this enormous body of men and of beasts
his face assume an expression of incredulity as he gaze and he pass his boney hand over his eye
this be what they call delirium i guess he mutter
the child stand beside him hold on to the skirt of his coat and say nothing but look all round her with the wonder question gaze of childhood
the rescue party be speedily able to convince the two castaways that their appearance be no delusion
one of them seize the little girl and hoist her upon his shoulder while two others support her gaunt companion and assist him towards the waggons
my name be john ferrier the wanderer explain me and that little un be all that's leave o' twenty one people
the rest be all dead o' thirst and hunger away down in the south
be she your child
ask someone
i guess she be now the other cry defiantly she's mine 'cause i save her
no man will take her from me
she's lucy ferrier from this day on
who be you though
he continue glance with curiosity at his stalwart sunburn rescuers there seem to be a powerful lot of ye
nigh upon ten thousand say one of the young men we be the persecute children of god the choose of the angel merona
i never hear tell on him say the wanderer
he appear to have choose a fair crowd of ye
do not jest at that which be sacred say the other sternly
we be of those who believe in those sacred write draw in egyptian letter on plat of beat gold which be hand unto the holy joseph smith at palmyra
we have come from nauvoo in the state of illinois where we have found our temple
we have come to seek a refuge from the violent man and from the godless even though it be the heart of the desert
the name of nauvoo evidently recall recollections to john ferrier
i see he say you be the mormons
we be the mormons answer his companion with one voice
and where be you go
we do not know
the hand of god be lead us under the person of our prophet
you must come before him
he shall say what be to be do with you
they have reach the base of the hill by this time and be surround by crowd of the pilgrims pale face meek look women strong laugh children and anxious earnest eye men
many be the cry of astonishment and of commiseration which arise from them when they perceive the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the other
their escort do not halt however but push on follow by a great crowd of mormons until they reach a waggon which be conspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of its appearance
six horse be yoke to it whereas the others be furnish with two or at most four a piece
beside the driver there sit a man who could not have be more than thirty years of age but whose massive head and resolute expression mark him as a leader
he be read a brown back volume but as the crowd approach he lay it aside and listen attentively to an account of the episode
then he turn to the two castaways
if we take you with us he say in solemn word it can only be as believers in our own creed
we shall have no wolves in our fold
better far that your bone should bleach in this wilderness than that you should prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupt the whole fruit
will you come with us on these term
guess i'll come with you on any term say ferrier with such emphasis that the grave elders could not restrain a smile
the leader alone retain his stern impressive expression
take him brother stangerson he say give him food and drink and the child likewise
let it be your task also to teach him our holy creed
we have delay long enough
forward
on on to zion
on on to zion
cry the crowd of mormons and the word ripple down the long caravan pass from mouth to mouth until they die away in a dull murmur in the far distance
with a crack of whip and a creak of wheel the great waggons get into motion and soon the whole caravan be wind along once more
the elder to whose care the two waifs have be commit lead them to his waggon where a meal be already await them
you shall remain here he say
in a few days you will have recover from your fatigue
in the meantime remember that now and for ever you be of our religion
brigham young have say it and he have speak with the voice of joseph smith which be the voice of god
this be not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endure by the immigrant mormons before they come to their final haven
from the shore of the mississippi to the western slop of the rocky mountains they have struggle on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history
the savage man and the savage beast hunger thirst fatigue and disease every impediment which nature could place in the way have all be overcome with anglo saxon tenacity
yet the long journey and the accumulate terrors have shake the hearts of the stoutest among them
there be not one who do not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer when they saw the broad valley of utah bath in the sunlight beneath them and learn from the lips of their leader that this be the promise land and that these virgin acres be to be theirs for evermore
young speedily prove himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a resolute chief
map be draw and chart prepare in which the future city be sketch out
all around farm be apportion and allot in proportion to the stand of each individual
the tradesman be put to his trade and the artisan to his call
in the town streets and square spring up as if by magic
in the country there be drain and hedge plant and clear until the next summer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop
everything prosper in the strange settlement
above all the great temple which they have erect in the centre of the city grow ever taller and larger
from the first blush of dawn until the close of the twilight the clatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw be never absent from the monument which the immigrants erect to him who have lead them safe through many dangers
the two castaways john ferrier and the little girl who have share his fortunes and have be adopt as his daughter accompany the mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage
little lucy ferrier be bear along pleasantly enough in elder stangerson's waggon a retreat which she share with the mormon's three wive and with his son a headstrong forward boy of twelve
have rally with the elasticity of childhood from the shock cause by her mother's death she soon become a pet with the women and reconcile herself to this new life in her move canvas cover home
in the meantime ferrier have recover from his privations distinguish himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter
so rapidly do he gain the esteem of his new companion that when they reach the end of their wander it be unanimously agree that he should be provide with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers with the exception of young himself and of stangerson kemball johnston and drebber who be the four principal elders
on the farm thus acquire john ferrier build himself a substantial log house which receive so many additions in succeed years that it grow into a roomy villa
he be a man of a practical turn of mind keen in his deal and skilful with his hand
his iron constitution enable him to work morning and even at improve and till his land
hence it come about that his farm and all that belong to him prosper exceedingly
in three years he be better off than his neighbour in six he be well to do in nine he be rich and in twelve there be not half a dozen men in the whole of salt lake city who could compare with him
from the great inland sea to the distant wahsatch mountains there be no name better know than that of john ferrier
there be one way and only one in which he offend the susceptibilities of his co religionists
no argument or persuasion could ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the manner of his companion
he never give reason for this persistent refusal but content himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhere to his determination
there be some who accuse him of lukewarmness in his adopt religion and others who put it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense
others again speak of some early love affair and of a fair haired girl who have pin away on the shore of the atlantic
whatever the reason ferrier remain strictly celibate
in every other respect he conform to the religion of the young settlement and gain the name of be an orthodox and straight walk man
lucy ferrier grow up within the log house and assist her adopt father in all his undertake
the keen air of the mountains and the balsamic odour of the pine tree take the place of nurse and mother to the young girl
as year succeed to year she grow taller and stronger her cheek more rudy and her step more elastic
many a wayfarer upon the high road which run by ferrier's farm felt long forget thoughts revive in their mind as they watch her lithe girlish figure trip through the wheatfields or meet her mount upon her father's mustang and manage it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the west
so the bud blossom into a flower and the year which saw her father the richest of the farmers leave her as fair a specimen of american girlhood as could be find in the whole pacific slope
it be not the father however who first discover that the child have develop into the woman
it seldom be in such case
that mysterious change be too subtle and too gradual to be measure by date
least of all do the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the touch of a hand set her heart thrill within her and she learn with a mixture of pride and of fear that a new and a larger nature have awake within her
there be few who cannot recall that day and remember the one little incident which herald the dawn of a new life
in the case of lucy ferrier the occasion be serious enough in itself apart from its future influence on her destiny and that of many besides
it be a warm june morning and the latter day saint be as busy as the be whose hive they have choose for their emblem
in the field and in the streets rise the same hum of human industry
down the dusty high roads defile long stream of heavily lade mules all head to the west for the gold fever have break out in california and the overland route lay through the city of the elect
there too be droves of sheep and bullocks come in from the outlying pasture land and train of tire immigrants men and horse equally weary of their interminable journey
through all this motley assemblage thread her way with the skill of an accomplish rider there gallop lucy ferrier her fair face flush with the exercise and her long chestnut hair float out behind her
she have a commission from her father in the city and be dash in as she have do many a time before with all the fearlessness of youth think only of her task and how it be to be perform
the travel stain adventurers gaze after her in astonishment and even the unemotional indians journey in with their pelties relax their accustom stoicism as they marvel at the beauty of the pale face maiden
she have reach the outskirts of the city when she find the road block by a great drive of cattle drive by a half dozen wild look herdsmen from the plain
in her impatience she endeavour to pass this obstacle by push her horse into what appear to be a gap
scarcely have she get fairly into it however before the beasts close in behind her and she find herself completely imbed in the move stream of fierce eye long horn bullocks
accustom as she be to deal with cattle she be not alarm at her situation but take advantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hop of push her way through the cavalcade
unfortunately the horn of one of the creatures either by accident or design come in violent contact with the flank of the mustang and excite it to madness
in an instant it rear up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage and prance and toss in a way that would have unseat any but a most skilful rider
the situation be full of peril
every plunge of the excite horse bring it against the horn again and goad it to fresh madness
it be all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle yet a slip would mean a terrible death under the hoof of the unwieldy and terrify animals
unaccustomed to sudden emergencies her head begin to swim and her grip upon the bridle to relax
choke by the rise cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggle creatures she might have abandon her efforts in despair but for a kindly voice at her elbow which assure her of assistance
at the same moment a sinewy brown hand catch the frighten horse by the curb and force a way through the drive soon bring her to the outskirts
you're not hurt i hope miss say her preserver respectfully
she look up at his dark fierce face and laugh saucily
i'm awful frighten she say naively whoever would have think that poncho would have be so scar by a lot of cow
thank god you keep your seat the other say earnestly
he be a tall savage look young fellow mount on a powerful roan horse and clothe in the rough dress of a hunter with a long rifle sling over his shoulder
i guess you be the daughter of john ferrier he remark i saw you ride down from his house
when you see him ask him if he remember the jefferson hop of st
louis
if he's the same ferrier my father and he be pretty thick
hadn't you better come and ask yourself
she ask demurely
the young fellow seem please at the suggestion and his dark eye sparkle with pleasure
i'll do so he say we've be in the mountains for two months and be not over and above in visit condition
he must take us as he find us
he have a good deal to thank you for and so have i she answer he's awful fond of me
if those cow have jump on me he'd have never get over it
neither would i say her companion
you
well i don't see that it would make much matter to you anyhow
you ain't even a friend of ours
the young hunter's dark face grow so gloomy over this remark that lucy ferrier laugh aloud
there i didn't mean that she say of course you be a friend now
you must come and see us
now i must push along or father won't trust me with his business any more
good bye
good bye he answer raise his broad sombrero and bend over her little hand
she wheel her mustang round give it a cut with her rid whip and dart away down the broad road in a roll cloud of dust
young jefferson hope ride on with his companion gloomy and taciturn
he and they have be among the nevada mountains prospect for silver and be return to salt lake city in the hope of raise capital enough to work some lodes which they have discover
he have be as keen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident have draw his thoughts into another channel
the sight of the fair young girl as frank and wholesome as the sierra breeze have stir his volcanic untamed heart to its very depths
when she have vanish from his sight he realize that a crisis have come in his life and that neither silver speculations nor any other question could ever be of such importance to him as this new and all absorb one
the love which have spring up in his heart be not the sudden changeable fancy of a boy but rather the wild fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper
he have be accustom to succeed in all that he undertake
he swear in his heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human perseverance could render him successful
he call on john ferrier that night and many time again until his face be a familiar one at the farm house
john cooped up in the valley and absorb in his work have have little chance of learn the news of the outside world during the last twelve years
all this jefferson hope be able to tell him and in a style which interest lucy as well as her father
he have be a pioneer in california and could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes make and fortunes lose in those wild halcyon days
he have be a scout too and a trapper a silver explorer and a ranchman
wherever stir adventure be to be have jefferson hope have be there in search of them
he soon become a favourite with the old farmer who speak eloquently of his virtues
on such occasion lucy be silent but her blush cheek and her bright happy eye show only too clearly that her young heart be no longer her own
her honest father may not have observe these symptoms but they be assuredly not throw away upon the man who have win her affections
it be a summer even when he come gallop down the road and pull up at the gate
she be at the doorway and come down to meet him
he throw the bridle over the fence and stride up the pathway
i be off lucy he say take her two hand in his and gaze tenderly down into her face i won't ask you to come with me now but will you be ready to come when i be here again
and when will that be
she ask blush and laugh
a couple of months at the outside
i will come and claim you then my darling
there's no one who can stand between us
and how about father
she ask
he have give his consent provide we get these mine work all right
i have no fear on that head
oh well of course if you and father have arrange it all there's no more to be say she whisper with her cheek against his broad breast
thank god
he say hoarsely stoop and kiss her
it be settle then
the longer i stay the harder it will be to go
they be wait for me at the canon
good bye my own darling good bye
in two months you shall see me
he tear himself from her as he speak and fling himself upon his horse gallop furiously away never even look round as though afraid that his resolution might fail him if he take one glance at what he be leave
she stand at the gate gaze after him until he vanish from her sight
then she walk back into the house the happiest girl in all utah
three weeks have pass since jefferson hope and his comrades have depart from salt lake city
john ferrier's heart be sore within him when he think of the young man's return and of the impend loss of his adopt child
yet her bright and happy face reconcile him to the arrangement more than any argument could have do
he have always determine deep down in his resolute heart that nothing would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a mormon
such a marriage he regard as no marriage at all but as a shame and a disgrace
whatever he might think of the mormon doctrines upon that one point he be inflexible
he have to seal his mouth on the subject however for to express an unorthodox opinion be a dangerous matter in those days in the land of the saint
yes a dangerous matter so dangerous that even the most saintly dare only whisper their religious opinions with bat breath lest something which fell from their lips might be misconstrue and bring down a swift retribution upon them
the victims of persecution have now turn persecutors on their own account and persecutors of the most terrible description
not the inquisition of seville nor the german vehm gericht nor the secret societies of italy be ever able to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over the state of utah
its invisibility and the mystery which be attach to it make this organization doubly terrible
it appear to be omniscient and omnipotent and yet be neither see nor hear
the man who hold out against the church vanish away and none know whither he have go or what have befall him
his wife and his children await him at home but no father ever return to tell them how he have fare at the hand of his secret judge
a rash word or a hasty act be follow by annihilation and yet none know what the nature might be of this terrible power which be suspend over them
no wonder that men go about in fear and tremble and that even in the heart of the wilderness they dare not whisper the doubt which oppress them
at first this vague and terrible power be exercise only upon the recalcitrants who have embrace the mormon faith wish afterwards to pervert or to abandon it
soon however it take a wider range
the supply of adult women be run short and polygamy without a female population on which to draw be a barren doctrine indeed
strange rumour begin to be bandy about rumour of murder immigrants and rifle camp in regions where indians have never be see
fresh women appear in the harems of the elders women who pin and weep and bore upon their face the trace of an unextinguishable horror
belated wanderers upon the mountains speak of gang of arm men mask stealthy and noiseless who flit by them in the darkness
these tales and rumour take substance and shape and be corroborate and re corroborate until they resolve themselves into a definite name
to this day in the lonely ranch of the west the name of the danite band or the avenge angels be a sinister and an ill omen one
fuller knowledge of the organization which produce such terrible result serve to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it inspire in the mind of men
none know who belong to this ruthless society
the name of the participators in the deeds of blood and violence do under the name of religion be keep profoundly secret
the very friend to whom you communicate your misgive as to the prophet and his mission might be one of those who would come forth at night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation
hence every man fear his neighbour and none speak of the things which be nearest his heart
one fine morning john ferrier be about to set out to his wheatfields when he hear the click of the latch and look through the window saw a stout sandy haired middle age man come up the pathway
his heart leap to his mouth for this be none other than the great brigham young himself
full of trepidation for he know that such a visit bode him little good ferrier run to the door to greet the mormon chief
the latter however receive his salutations coldly and follow him with a stern face into the sit room
brother ferrier he say take a seat and eye the farmer keenly from under his light colour eyelashes the true believers have be good friends to you
we pick you up when you be starve in the desert we share our food with you lead you safe to the choose valley give you a goodly share of land and allow you to wax rich under our protection
be not this so

in return for all this we ask but one condition that be that you should embrace the true faith and conform in every way to its usages
this you promise to do and this if common report say truly you have neglect
and how have i neglect it

but women be few and there be many who have better claim than i i be not a lonely man i have my daughter to attend to my want
it be of that daughter that i would speak to you say the leader of the mormons
she have grow to be the flower of utah and have find favour in the eye of many who be high in the land
john ferrier groan internally
there be stories of her which i would fain disbelieve stories that she be seal to some gentile
this must be the gossip of idle tongue
what be the thirteenth rule in the code of the saint joseph smith
'let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect for if she wed a gentile she commit a grievous sin '
this be so it be impossible that you who profess the holy creed should suffer your daughter to violate it
john ferrier make no answer but he play nervously with his rid whip
upon this one point your whole faith shall be test so it have be decide in the sacred council of four
the girl be young and we would not have her wed grey hairs neither would we deprive her of all choice
we elders have many heifers but our children must also be provide
stangerson have a son and drebber have a son and either of them would gladly welcome your daughter to their house
let her choose between them
they be young and rich and of the true faith
what say you to that
ferrier remain silent for some little time with his brows knit
you will give us time he say at last
my daughter be very young she be scarce of an age to marry
she shall have a month to choose say young rise from his seat
at the end of that time she shall give her answer
he be pass through the door when he turn with flush face and flash eye
it be better for you john ferrier he thunder that you and she be now lie blanch skeletons upon the sierra blanco than that you should put your weak will against the order of the holy four
with a threaten gesture of his hand he turn from the door and ferrier hear his heavy step scrunch along the shingly path
he be still sit with his elbow upon his knees consider how he should broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand be lay upon his and look up he saw her stand beside him
one glance at her pale frighten face show him that she have hear what have pass
i could not help it she say in answer to his look
his voice ring through the house
oh father father what shall we do
don't you scare yourself he answer draw her to him and pass his broad rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair
we'll fix it up somehow or another
you don't find your fancy kind o' lessen for this chap do you
a sob and a squeeze of his hand be her only answer
no of course not
i shouldn't care to hear you say you do
he's a likely lad and he's a christian which be more than these folk here in spite o' all their pray and preach
there's a party start for nevada to morrow and i'll manage to send him a message let him know the hole we be in
if i know anything o' that young man he'll be back here with a speed that would whip electro telegraph
lucy laugh through her tear at her father's description
when he come he will advise us for the best
but it be for you that i be frighten dear
one hear one hear such dreadful stories about those who oppose the prophet something terrible always happen to them
but we haven't oppose him yet her father answer
it will be time to look out for squall when we do
we have a clear month before us at the end of that i guess we have best shin out of utah
leave utah
that's about the size of it
but the farm
we will raise as much as we can in money and let the rest go
to tell the truth lucy it isn't the first time i have think of do it
i don't care about knuckle under to any man as these folk do to their darn prophet
i'm a free bear american and it's all new to me
guess i'm too old to learn
if he come browse about this farm he might chance to run up against a charge of buckshot travel in the opposite direction
but they won't let us leave his daughter object
wait till jefferson come and we'll soon manage that
in the meantime don't you fret yourself my dearie and don't get your eye swell up else he'll be walk into me when he see you
there's nothing to be afeared about and there's no danger at all
john ferrier utter these console remark in a very confident tone but she could not help observe that he pay unusual care to the fasten of the doors that night and that he carefully clean and load the rusty old shotgun which hang upon the wall of his bedroom
on the morning which follow his interview with the mormon prophet john ferrier go in to salt lake city and have find his acquaintance who be bind for the nevada mountains he entrust him with his message to jefferson hope
in it he tell the young man of the imminent danger which threaten them and how necessary it be that he should return
have do thus he felt easier in his mind and return home with a lighter heart
as he approach his farm he be surprise to see a horse hitch to each of the post of the gate
still more surprise be he on enter to find two young men in possession of his sit room
one with a long pale face be lean back in the rock chair with his feet cock up upon the stave
the other a bull neck youth with coarse bloat feature be stand in front of the window with his hand in his pocket whistle a popular hymn
both of them nod to ferrier as he enter and the one in the rock chair commence the conversation
maybe you don't know us he say
this here be the son of elder drebber and i'm joseph stangerson who travel with you in the desert when the lord stretch out his hand and gather you into the true fold
as he will all the nations in his own good time say the other in a nasal voice he grindeth slowly but exceed small
john ferrier bow coldly
he have guess who his visitors be
we have come continue stangerson at the advice of our father to solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to you and to her
as i have but four wive and brother drebber here have seven it appear to me that my claim be the stronger one
nay nay brother stangerson cry the other the question be not how many wive we have but how many we can keep
my father have now give over his mill to me and i be the richer man
but my prospect be better say the other warmly
when the lord remove my father i shall have his tan yard and his leather factory
then i be your elder and be higher in the church
it will be for the maiden to decide rejoin young drebber smirk at his own reflection in the glass
we will leave it all to her decision
during this dialogue john ferrier have stand fume in the doorway hardly able to keep his rid whip from the back of his two visitors
look here he say at last stride up to them when my daughter summon you you can come but until then i don't want to see your face again
the two young mormons star at him in amazement
in their eye this competition between them for the maiden's hand be the highest of honour both to her and her father
there be two ways out of the room cry ferrier there be the door and there be the window
which do you care to use
his brown face look so savage and his gaunt hand so threaten that his visitors spring to their feet and beat a hurry retreat
the old farmer follow them to the door
let me know when you have settle which it be to be he say sardonically
you shall smart for this
stangerson cry white with rage
you have defy the prophet and the council of four
you shall rue it to the end of your days
the hand of the lord shall be heavy upon you cry young drebber he will arise and smite you
then i'll start the smite exclaim ferrier furiously and would have rush upstairs for his gun have not lucy seize him by the arm and restrain him
before he could escape from her the clatter of horses' hoof tell him that they be beyond his reach
the young cant rascals
he exclaim wipe the perspiration from his forehead i would sooner see you in your grave my girl than the wife of either of them
and so should i father she answer with spirit but jefferson will soon be here
yes
it will not be long before he come
the sooner the better for we do not know what their next move may be
it be indeed high time that someone capable of give advice and help should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopt daughter
in the whole history of the settlement there have never be such a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the elders
if minor errors be punish so sternly what would be the fate of this arch rebel
ferrier know that his wealth and position would be of no avail to him
others as well know and as rich as himself have be spirit away before now and their goods give over to the church
he be a brave man but he tremble at the vague shadowy terrors which hang over him
any know danger he could face with a firm lip but this suspense be unnerve
he conceal his fear from his daughter however and affect to make light of the whole matter though she with the keen eye of love saw plainly that he be ill at ease
he expect that he would receive some message or remonstrance from young as to his conduct and he be not mistake though it come in an unlooked for manner
upon rise next morning he find to his surprise a small square of paper pin on to the coverlet of his bed just over his chest
on it be print in bold straggle letter twenty nine days be give you for amendment and then the dash be more fear inspire than any threat could have be
how this warn come into his room puzzle john ferrier sorely for his servants sleep in an outhouse and the doors and windows have all be secure
he crumple the paper up and say nothing to his daughter but the incident strike a chill into his heart
the twenty nine days be evidently the balance of the month which young have promise
what strength or courage could avail against an enemy arm with such mysterious power
the hand which fasten that pin might have strike him to the heart and he could never have know who have slay him
still more shake be he next morning
they have sit down to their breakfast when lucy with a cry of surprise point upwards
in the centre of the ceiling be scrawl with a burn stick apparently the number
to his daughter it be unintelligible and he do not enlighten her
that night he sit up with his gun and keep watch and ward
he saw and he hear nothing and yet in the morning a great have be paint upon the outside of his door
thus day follow day and as sure as morning come he find that his unseen enemies have keep their register and have mark up in some conspicuous position how many days be still leave to him out of the month of grace
sometimes the fatal number appear upon the wall sometimes upon the floor occasionally they be on small placard stick upon the garden gate or the rail
with all his vigilance john ferrier could not discover whence these daily warn proceed
a horror which be almost superstitious come upon him at the sight of them
he become haggard and restless and his eye have the trouble look of some hunt creature
he have but one hope in life now and that be for the arrival of the young hunter from nevada
twenty have change to fifteen and fifteen to ten but there be no news of the absentee
one by one the number dwindle down and still there come no sign of him
whenever a horseman clatter down the road or a driver shout at his team the old farmer hurry to the gate think that help have arrive at last
at last when he saw five give way to four and that again to three he lose heart and abandon all hope of escape
single hand and with his limit knowledge of the mountains which surround the settlement he know that he be powerless
the more frequent roads be strictly watch and guard and none could pass along them without an order from the council
turn which way he would there appear to be no avoid the blow which hang over him
yet the old man never waver in his resolution to part with life itself before he consent to what he regard as his daughter's dishonour
he be sit alone one even ponder deeply over his trouble and search vainly for some way out of them
that morning have show the figure upon the wall of his house and the next day would be the last of the allot time
what be to happen then
all manner of vague and terrible fancy fill his imagination
and his daughter what be to become of her after he be go
be there no escape from the invisible network which be draw all round them
he sink his head upon the table and sob at the think of his own impotence
what be that
in the silence he hear a gentle scratch sound low but very distinct in the quiet of the night
it come from the door of the house
ferrier creep into the hall and listen intently
there be a pause for a few moments and then the low insidious sound be repeat
someone be evidently tap very gently upon one of the panel of the door
be it some midnight assassin who have come to carry out the murderous order of the secret tribunal
or be it some agent who be mark up that the last day of grace have arrive
john ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shake his nerve and chill his heart
spring forward he draw the bolt and throw the door open
outside all be calm and quiet
the night be fine and the star be twinkle brightly overhead
the little front garden lay before the farmer's eye bound by the fence and gate but neither there nor on the road be any human be to be see
with a sigh of relief ferrier look to right and to leave until happen to glance straight down at his own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lie flat upon his face upon the grind with arm and legs all asprawl
so unnerve be he at the sight that he lean up against the wall with his hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out
his first think be that the prostrate figure be that of some wound or die man but as he watch it he saw it writhe along the grind and into the hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent
once within the house the man spring to his feet close the door and reveal to the astonish farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of jefferson hope
good god
gasp john ferrier
how you scar me
whatever make you come in like that
give me food the other say hoarsely
i have have no time for bite or sup for eight and forty hours
he fling himself upon the cold meat and bread which be still lie upon the table from his host's supper and devour it voraciously
do lucy bear up well
he ask when he have satisfy his hunger
yes
she do not know the danger her father answer
that be well
the house be watch on every side
that be why i crawl my way up to it
they may be darn sharp but they're not quite sharp enough to catch a washoe hunter
john ferrier felt a different man now that he realize that he have a devote ally
he seize the young man's leathery hand and wring it cordially
you're a man to be proud of he say
there be not many who would come to share our danger and our trouble
you've hit it there pard the young hunter answer
i have a respect for you but if you be alone in this business i'd think twice before i put my head into such a hornet's nest
it's lucy that bring me here and before harm come on her i guess there will be one less o' the hope family in utah
what be we to do
to morrow be your last day and unless you act to night you be lose
i have a mule and two horse wait in the eagle ravine
how much money have you
two thousand dollars in gold and five in note
that will do
i have as much more to add to it
we must push for carson city through the mountains
you have best wake lucy
it be as well that the servants do not sleep in the house
while ferrier be absent prepare his daughter for the approach journey jefferson hope pack all the eatables that he could find into a small parcel and fill a stoneware jar with water for he know by experience that the mountain well be few and far between
he have hardly complete his arrangements before the farmer return with his daughter all dress and ready for a start
the greet between the lovers be warm but brief for minutes be precious and there be much to be do
we must make our start at once say jefferson hope speak in a low but resolute voice like one who realize the greatness of the peril but have steel his heart to meet it
the front and back entrance be watch but with caution we may get away through the side window and across the field
once on the road we be only two miles from the ravine where the horse be wait
by daybreak we should be half way through the mountains
what if we be stop ask ferrier
hope slap the revolver butt which protrude from the front of his tunic
if they be too many for us we shall take two or three of them with us he say with a sinister smile
the light inside the house have all be extinguish and from the darken window ferrier peer over the field which have be his own and which he be now about to abandon for ever
he have long nerve himself to the sacrifice however and the think of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweigh any regret at his ruin fortunes
all look so peaceful and happy the rustle tree and the broad silent stretch of grain land that it be difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurk through it all
yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter show that in his approach to the house he have see enough to satisfy him upon that head
ferrier carry the bag of gold and note jefferson hope have the scanty provision and water while lucy have a small bundle contain a few of her more value possessions
open the window very slowly and carefully they wait until a dark cloud have somewhat obscure the night and then one by one pass through into the little garden
with bat breath and crouch figure they stumble across it and gain the shelter of the hedge which they skirt until they come to the gap which open into the cornfields
they have just reach this point when the young man seize his two companion and drag them down into the shadow where they lay silent and tremble
it be as well that his prairie train have give jefferson hope the ears of a lynx
he and his friends have hardly crouch down before the melancholy hoot of a mountain owl be hear within a few yards of them which be immediately answer by another hoot at a small distance
at the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerge from the gap for which they have be make and utter the plaintive signal cry again on which a second man appear out of the obscurity
to morrow at midnight say the first who appear to be in authority
when the whip poor will call three time
it be well return the other
shall i tell brother drebber
pass it on to him and from him to the others
nine to seven
seven to five
repeat the other and the two figure flit away in different directions
their conclude word have evidently be some form of sign and countersign
the instant that their footsteps have die away in the distance jefferson hope spring to his feet and help his companion through the gap lead the way across the field at the top of his speed support and half carry the girl when her strength appear to fail her
hurry on
hurry on
he gasp from time to time
we be through the line of sentinels
everything depend on speed
hurry on
once on the high road they make rapid progress
only once do they meet anyone and then they manage to slip into a field and so avoid recognition
before reach the town the hunter branch away into a rugged and narrow footpath which lead to the mountains
two dark jag peak loom above them through the darkness and the defile which lead between them be the eagle canon in which the horse be await them
with unerring instinct jefferson hope pick his way among the great boulders and along the bed of a dry up watercourse until he come to the retire corner screen with rock where the faithful animals have be picket
the girl be place upon the mule and old ferrier upon one of the horse with his money bag while jefferson hope lead the other along the precipitous and dangerous path
it be a bewilder route for anyone who be not accustom to face nature in her wildest moods
on the one side a great crag tower up a thousand feet or more black stern and menace with long basaltic columns upon its rugged surface like the rib of some petrify monster
on the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris make all advance impossible
between the two run the irregular track so narrow in place that they have to travel in indian file and so rough that only practise riders could have traverse it at all
yet in spite of all dangers and difficulties the hearts of the fugitives be light within them for every step increase the distance between them and the terrible despotism from which they be fly
they soon have a proof however that they be still within the jurisdiction of the saint
they have reach the very wildest and most desolate portion of the pass when the girl give a startle cry and point upwards
on a rock which overlook the track show out dark and plain against the sky there stand a solitary sentinel
he saw them as soon as they perceive him and his military challenge of who go there
ring through the silent ravine
travellers for nevada say jefferson hope with his hand upon the rifle which hang by his saddle
they could see the lonely watcher finger his gun and peer down at them as if dissatisfy at their reply
by whose permission
he ask
the holy four answer ferrier
his mormon experience have teach him that that be the highest authority to which he could refer
nine from seven cry the sentinel
seven from five return jefferson hope promptly remember the countersign which he have hear in the garden
pass and the lord go with you say the voice from above
beyond his post the path broaden out and the horse be able to break into a trot
look back they could see the solitary watcher lean upon his gun and know that they have pass the outlying post of the choose people and that freedom lay before them
all night their course lay through intricate defile and over irregular and rock strew paths
more than once they lose their way but hope's intimate knowledge of the mountains enable them to regain the track once more
when morning break a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them
in every direction the great snow cap peak hem them in peep over each other's shoulder to the far horizon
so steep be the rocky bank on either side of them that the larch and the pine seem to be suspend over their head and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtle down upon them
nor be the fear entirely an illusion for the barren valley be thickly strew with tree and boulders which have fall in a similar manner
even as they pass a great rock come thunder down with a hoarse rattle which wake the echo in the silent gorge and startle the weary horse into a gallop
as the sun rise slowly above the eastern horizon the cap of the great mountains light up one after the other like lamps at a festival until they be all ruddy and glow
the magnificent spectacle cheer the hearts of the three fugitives and give them fresh energy
at a wild torrent which sweep out of a ravine they call a halt and water their horse while they partake of a hasty breakfast
lucy and her father would fain have rest longer but jefferson hope be inexorable
they will be upon our track by this time he say
everything depend upon our speed
once safe in carson we may rest for the remainder of our live
during the whole of that day they struggle on through the defile and by even they calculate that they be more than thirty miles from their enemies
at night time they choose the base of a beetle crag where the rock offer some protection from the chill wind and there huddle together for warmth they enjoy a few hours' sleep
before daybreak however they be up and on their way once more
they have see no sign of any pursuers and jefferson hope begin to think that they be fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they have incur
he little know how far that iron grasp could reach or how soon it be to close upon them and crush them
about the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of provision begin to run out
this give the hunter little uneasiness however for there be game to be have among the mountains and he have frequently before have to depend upon his rifle for the need of life
choose a shelter nook he pile together a few dry branch and make a blaze fire at which his companion might warm themselves for they be now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level and the air be bitter and keen
have tether the horse and bid lucy adieu he throw his gun over his shoulder and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way
look back he saw the old man and the young girl crouch over the blaze fire while the three animals stand motionless in the back grind
then the intervene rock hide them from his view
he walk for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without success though from the mark upon the bark of the tree and other indications he judge that there be numerous bear in the vicinity
at last after two or three hours' fruitless search he be think of turn back in despair when cast his eye upwards he saw a sight which send a thrill of pleasure through his heart
on the edge of a jut pinnacle three or four hundred feet above him there stand a creature somewhat resemble a sheep in appearance but arm with a pair of gigantic horn
the big horn for so it be call be act probably as a guardian over a flock which be invisible to the hunter but fortunately it be head in the opposite direction and have not perceive him
lie on his face he rest his rifle upon a rock and take a long and steady aim before draw the trigger
the animal spring into the air totter for a moment upon the edge of the precipice and then come crash down into the valley beneath
the creature be too unwieldy to lift so the hunter content himself with cut away one haunch and part of the flank
with this trophy over his shoulder he hasten to retrace his step for the even be already draw in
he have hardly start however before he realize the difficulty which face him
in his eagerness he have wander far past the ravines which be know to him and it be no easy matter to pick out the path which he have take
the valley in which he find himself divide and sub divide into many gorge which be so like each other that it be impossible to distinguish one from the other
he follow one for a mile or more until he come to a mountain torrent which he be sure that he have never see before
convince that he have take the wrong turn he try another but with the same result
night be come on rapidly and it be almost dark before he at last find himself in a defile which be familiar to him
even then it be no easy matter to keep to the right track for the moon have not yet rise and the high cliffs on either side make the obscurity more profound
weigh down with his burden and weary from his exertions he stumble along keep up his heart by the reflection that every step bring him nearer to lucy and that he carry with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey
he have now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he have leave them
even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bound it
they must he reflect be await him anxiously for he have be absent nearly five hours
in the gladness of his heart he put his hand to his mouth and make the glen re echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he be come
he pause and listen for an answer
none come save his own cry which clatter up the dreary silent ravines and be bear back to his ears in countless repetitions
again he shout even louder than before and again no whisper come back from the friends whom he have leave such a short time ago
a vague nameless dread come over him and he hurry onwards frantically drop the precious food in his agitation
when he turn the corner he come full in sight of the spot where the fire have be light
there be still a glow pile of wood ash there but it have evidently not be tend since his departure
the same dead silence still reign all round
with his fear all change to convictions he hurry on
there be no live creature near the remain of the fire animals man maiden all be go
it be only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster have occur during his absence a disaster which have embrace them all and yet have leave no trace behind it
bewilder and stun by this blow jefferson hope felt his head spin round and have to lean upon his rifle to save himself from fall
he be essentially a man of action however and speedily recover from his temporary impotence
seize a half consume piece of wood from the smoulder fire he blow it into a flame and proceed with its help to examine the little camp
the grind be all stamp down by the feet of horse show that a large party of mount men have overtake the fugitives and the direction of their track prove that they have afterwards turn back to salt lake city
have they carry back both of his companion with them
jefferson hope have almost persuade himself that they must have do so when his eye fell upon an object which make every nerve of his body tingle within him
a little way on one side of the camp be a low lie heap of reddish soil which have assuredly not be there before
there be no mistake it for anything but a newly dig grave
as the young hunter approach it he perceive that a stick have be plant on it with a sheet of paper stick in the cleave fork of it
the inscription upon the paper be brief but to the point john ferrier formerly of salt lake city die august 4th
the sturdy old man whom he have leave so short a time before be go then and this be all his epitaph
jefferson hope look wildly round to see if there be a second grave but there be no sign of one
lucy have be carry back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original destiny by become one of the harem of the elder's son
as the young fellow realize the certainty of her fate and his own powerlessness to prevent it he wish that he too be lie with the old farmer in his last silent rest place
again however his active spirit shake off the lethargy which spring from despair
if there be nothing else leave to him he could at least devote his life to revenge
with indomitable patience and perseverance jefferson hope possess also a power of sustain vindictiveness which he may have learn from the indians amongst whom he have live
as he stand by the desolate fire he felt that the only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution bring by his own hand upon his enemies
his strong will and untiring energy should he determine be devote to that one end
with a grim white face he retrace his step to where he have drop the food and have stir up the smoulder fire he cook enough to last him for a few days
this he make up into a bundle and tire as he be he set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the avenge angels
for five days he toil footsore and weary through the defile which he have already traverse on horseback
at night he fling himself down among the rock and snatch a few hours of sleep but before daybreak he be always well on his way
on the sixth day he reach the eagle canon from which they have commence their ill fat flight
thence he could look down upon the home of the saint
wear and exhaust he lean upon his rifle and shake his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him
as he look at it he observe that there be flag in some of the principal streets and other sign of festivity
he be still speculate as to what this might mean when he hear the clatter of horse's hoof and saw a mount man rid towards him
as he approach he recognize him as a mormon name cowper to whom he have render service at different time
he therefore accost him when he get up to him with the object of find out what lucy ferrier's fate have be
i be jefferson hope he say
you remember me
the mormon look at him with undisguised astonishment indeed it be difficult to recognize in this tattered unkempt wanderer with ghastly white face and fierce wild eye the spruce young hunter of former days
have however at last satisfy himself as to his identity the man's surprise change to consternation
you be mad to come here he cry
it be as much as my own life be worth to be see talk with you
there be a warrant against you from the holy four for assist the ferriers away
i don't fear them or their warrant hope say earnestly
you must know something of this matter cowper
i conjure you by everything you hold dear to answer a few question
we have always be friends
for god's sake don't refuse to answer me
what be it
the mormon ask uneasily
be quick
the very rock have ears and the tree eye
what have become of lucy ferrier
she be marry yesterday to young drebber
hold up man hold up you have no life leave in you
don't mind me say hope faintly
he be white to the very lips and have sink down on the stone against which he have be lean
marry you say
marry yesterday that's what those flag be for on the endowment house
there be some word between young drebber and young stangerson as to which be to have her
they'd both be in the party that follow them and stangerson have shoot her father which seem to give him the best claim but when they argue it out in council drebber's party be the stronger so the prophet give her over to him
no one won't have her very long though for i saw death in her face yesterday
she be more like a ghost than a woman
be you off then
yes i be off say jefferson hope who have rise from his seat
his face might have be chisel out of marble so hard and set be its expression while its eye glow with a baleful light
where be you go
never mind he answer and sling his weapon over his shoulder stride off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to the haunt of the wild beasts
amongst them all there be none so fierce and so dangerous as himself
the prediction of the mormon be only too well fulfil
whether it be the terrible death of her father or the effect of the hateful marriage into which she have be force poor lucy never hold up her head again but pin away and die within a month
her sottish husband who have marry her principally for the sake of john ferrier's property do not affect any great grief at his bereavement but his other wive mourn over her and sit up with her the night before the burial as be the mormon custom
they be group round the bier in the early hours of the morning when to their inexpressible fear and astonishment the door be fling open and a savage look weather beat man in tattered garment stride into the room
without a glance or a word to the cower women he walk up to the white silent figure which have once contain the pure soul of lucy ferrier
stoop over her he press his lips reverently to her cold forehead and then snatch up her hand he take the wed ring from her finger
she shall not be bury in that he cry with a fierce snarl and before an alarm could be raise spring down the stairs and be go
so strange and so brief be the episode that the watchers might have find it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it have it not be for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which mark her as have be a bride have disappear
for some months jefferson hope linger among the mountains lead a strange wild life and nurse in his heart the fierce desire for vengeance which possess him
tales be tell in the city of the weird figure which be see prowl about the suburbs and which haunt the lonely mountain gorge
once a bullet whistle through stangerson's window and flatten itself upon the wall within a foot of him
on another occasion as drebber pass under a cliff a great boulder crash down on him and he only escape a terrible death by throw himself upon his face
the two young mormons be not long in discover the reason of these attempt upon their live and lead repeat expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capture or kill their enemy but always without success
then they adopt the precaution of never go out alone or after nightfall and of have their house guard
after a time they be able to relax these measure for nothing be either hear or see of their opponent and they hop that time have cool his vindictiveness
far from do so it have if anything augment it
the hunter's mind be of a hard unyielding nature and the predominant idea of revenge have take such complete possession of it that there be no room for any other emotion
he be however above all things practical
he soon realize that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant strain which he be put upon it
exposure and want of wholesome food be wear him out
if he die like a dog among the mountains what be to become of his revenge then
and yet such a death be sure to overtake him if he persist
he felt that that be to play his enemy's game so he reluctantly return to the old nevada mine there to recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation
his intention have be to be absent a year at the most but a combination of unforeseen circumstances prevent his leave the mine for nearly five
at the end of that time however his memory of his wrong and his crave for revenge be quite as keen as on that memorable night when he have stand by john ferrier's grave
disguise and under an assume name he return to salt lake city careless what become of his own life as long as he obtain what he know to be justice
there he find evil tide await him
there have be a schism among the choose people a few months before some of the younger members of the church have rebel against the authority of the elders and the result have be the secession of a certain number of the malcontents who have leave utah and become gentiles
among these have be drebber and stangerson and no one know whither they have go
rumour report that drebber have manage to convert a large part of his property into money and that he have depart a wealthy man while his companion stangerson be comparatively poor
there be no clue at all however as to their whereabouts
many a man however vindictive would have abandon all think of revenge in the face of such a difficulty but jefferson hope never falter for a moment
with the small competence he possess eked out by such employment as he could pick up he travel from town to town through the unite state in quest of his enemies
year pass into year his black hair turn grizzle but still he wander on a human bloodhound with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he have devote his life
at last his perseverance be reward
it be but a glance of a face in a window but that one glance tell him that cleveland in ohio possess the men whom he be in pursuit of
he return to his miserable lodge with his plan of vengeance all arrange
it chance however that drebber look from his window have recognize the vagrant in the street and have read murder in his eye
he hurry before a justice of the peace accompany by stangerson who have become his private secretary and represent to him that they be in danger of their live from the jealousy and hatred of an old rival
that even jefferson hope be take into custody and not be able to find sureties be detain for some weeks
when at last he be liberate it be only to find that drebber's house be desert and that he and his secretary have depart for europe
again the avenger have be foil and again his concentrate hatred urge him to continue the pursuit
fund be want however and for some time he have to return to work save every dollar for his approach journey
at last have collect enough to keep life in him he depart for europe and track his enemies from city to city work his way in any menial capacity but never overtake the fugitives
when he reach st
petersburg they have depart for paris and when he follow them there he learn that they have just set off for copenhagen
at the danish capital he be again a few days late for they have journey on to london where he at last succeed in run them to earth
as to what occur there we cannot do better than quote the old hunter's own account as duly record in dr
watson's journal to which we be already under such obligations
our prisoner's furious resistance do not apparently indicate any ferocity in his disposition towards ourselves for on find himself powerless he smile in an affable manner and express his hop that he have not hurt any of us in the scuffle
i guess you're go to take me to the police station he remark to sherlock holmes
my cab's at the door
if you'll loose my legs i'll walk down to it
i'm not so light to lift as i use to be
gregson and lestrade exchange glance as if they think this proposition rather a bold one but holmes at once take the prisoner at his word and loosen the towel which we have bind round his ancles
he rise and stretch his legs as though to assure himself that they be free once more
i remember that i think to myself as i eye him that i have seldom see a more powerfully build man and his dark sunburn face bore an expression of determination and energy which be as formidable as his personal strength
if there's a vacant place for a chief of the police i reckon you be the man for it he say gaze with undisguised admiration at my fellow lodger
the way you keep on my trail be a caution
you have better come with me say holmes to the two detectives
i can drive you say lestrade
good
and gregson can come inside with me
you too doctor you have take an interest in the case and may as well stick to us
i assent gladly and we all descend together
our prisoner make no attempt at escape but step calmly into the cab which have be his and we follow him
lestrade mount the box whip up the horse and bring us in a very short time to our destination
we be usher into a small chamber where a police inspector note down our prisoner's name and the name of the men with whose murder he have be charge
the official be a white face unemotional man who go through his duties in a dull mechanical way
the prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the course of the week he say in the mean time mr
jefferson hope have you anything that you wish to say
i must warn you that your word will be take down and may be use against you
i've get a good deal to say our prisoner say slowly
i want to tell you gentlemen all about it
hadn't you better reserve that for your trial
ask the inspector
i may never be try he answer
you needn't look startle
it isn't suicide i be think of
be you a doctor
he turn his fierce dark eye upon me as he ask this last question
yes i be i answer
then put your hand here he say with a smile motion with his manacle wrists towards his chest
i do so and become at once conscious of an extraordinary throb and commotion which be go on inside
the wall of his chest seem to thrill and quiver as a frail build would do inside when some powerful engine be at work
in the silence of the room i could hear a dull hum and buzz noise which proceed from the same source
why i cry you have an aortic aneurism
that's what they call it he say placidly
i go to a doctor last week about it and he tell me that it be bind to burst before many days pass
it have be get worse for years
i get it from over exposure and under feed among the salt lake mountains
i've do my work now and i don't care how soon i go but i should like to leave some account of the business behind me
i don't want to be remember as a common cut throat
the inspector and the two detectives have a hurry discussion as to the advisability of allow him to tell his story
do you consider doctor that there be immediate danger
the former ask most certainly there be i answer
in that case it be clearly our duty in the interest of justice to take his statement say the inspector
you be at liberty sir to give your account which i again warn you will be take down
i'll sit down with your leave the prisoner say suit the action to the word
this aneurism of mine make me easily tire and the tussle we have half an hour ago have not mend matter
i'm on the brink of the grave and i be not likely to lie to you
every word i say be the absolute truth and how you use it be a matter of no consequence to me
with these word jefferson hope lean back in his chair and begin the follow remarkable statement
he speak in a calm and methodical manner as though the events which he narrate be commonplace enough
i can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoin account for i have have access to lestrade's note book in which the prisoner's word be take down exactly as they be utter
it don't much matter to you why i hat these men he say it's enough that they be guilty of the death of two human be a father and a daughter and that they have therefore forfeit their own live
after the lapse of time that have pass since their crime it be impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court
i know of their guilt though and i determine that i should be judge jury and executioner all roll into one
you'd have do the same if you have any manhood in you if you have be in my place
that girl that i speak of be to have marry me twenty years ago
she be force into marry that same drebber and break her heart over it
i take the marriage ring from her dead finger and i vow that his die eye should rest upon that very ring and that his last thoughts should be of the crime for which he be punish
i have carry it about with me and have follow him and his accomplice over two continents until i catch them
they think to tire me out but they could not do it
if i die to morrow as be likely enough i die know that my work in this world be do and well do
they have perish and by my hand
there be nothing leave for me to hope for or to desire
they be rich and i be poor so that it be no easy matter for me to follow them
when i get to london my pocket be about empty and i find that i must turn my hand to something for my live
drive and rid be as natural to me as walk so i apply at a cabowner's office and soon get employment
i be to bring a certain sum a week to the owner and whatever be over that i might keep for myself
there be seldom much over but i manage to scrape along somehow
the hardest job be to learn my way about for i reckon that of all the mazes that ever be contrive this city be the most confuse
i have a map beside me though and when once i have spot the principal hotels and station i get on pretty well
it be some time before i find out where my two gentlemen be live but i inquire and inquire until at last i drop across them
they be at a board house at camberwell over on the other side of the river
when once i find them out i know that i have them at my mercy
i have grow my beard and there be no chance of their recognize me
i would dog them and follow them until i saw my opportunity
i be determine that they should not escape me again
they be very near do it for all that
go where they would about london i be always at their heel
sometimes i follow them on my cab and sometimes on foot but the former be the best for then they could not get away from me
it be only early in the morning or late at night that i could earn anything so that i begin to get behind hand with my employer
i do not mind that however as long as i could lay my hand upon the men i want
they be very cunning though
they must have think that there be some chance of their be follow for they would never go out alone and never after nightfall
during two weeks i drive behind them every day and never once saw them separate
drebber himself be drink half the time but stangerson be not to be catch nap
i watch them late and early but never saw the ghost of a chance but i be not discourage for something tell me that the hour have almost come
my only fear be that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon and leave my work undo
at last one even i be drive up and down torquay terrace as the street be call in which they board when i saw a cab drive up to their door
presently some luggage be bring out and after a time drebber and stangerson follow it and drive off
i whip up my horse and keep within sight of them feel very ill at ease for i fear that they be go to shift their quarter
at euston station they get out and i leave a boy to hold my horse and follow them on to the platform
i hear them ask for the liverpool train and the guard answer that one have just go and there would not be another for some hours
stangerson seem to be put out at that but drebber be rather please than otherwise
i get so close to them in the bustle that i could hear every word that pass between them
drebber say that he have a little business of his own to do and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him
his companion remonstrate with him and remind him that they have resolve to stick together
drebber answer that the matter be a delicate one and that he must go alone
i could not catch what stangerson say to that but the other burst out swear and remind him that he be nothing more than his pay servant and that he must not presume to dictate to him
on that the secretary give it up as a bad job and simply bargain with him that if he miss the last train he should rejoin him at halliday's private hotel to which drebber answer that he would be back on the platform before eleven and make his way out of the station
the moment for which i have wait so long have at last come
i have my enemies within my power
together they could protect each other but singly they be at my mercy
i do not act however with undue precipitation
my plan be already form
there be no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender have time to realize who it be that strike him and why retribution have come upon him
i have my plan arrange by which i should have the opportunity of make the man who have wrong me understand that his old sin have find him out
it chance that some days before a gentleman who have be engage in look over some house in the brixton road have drop the key of one of them in my carriage
it be claim that same even and return but in the interval i have take a mould of it and have a duplicate construct
by mean of this i have access to at least one spot in this great city where i could rely upon be free from interruption
how to get drebber to that house be the difficult problem which i have now to solve
he walk down the road and go into one or two liquor shop stay for nearly half an hour in the last of them
when he come out he stagger in his walk and be evidently pretty well on
there be a hansom just in front of me and he hail it
i follow it so close that the nose of my horse be within a yard of his driver the whole way
we rattle across waterloo bridge and through miles of streets until to my astonishment we find ourselves back in the terrace in which he have board
i could not imagine what his intention be in return there but i go on and pull up my cab a hundred yards or so from the house
he enter it and his hansom drive away
give me a glass of water if you please
my mouth get dry with the talk
i hand him the glass and he drink it down
that's better he say
well i wait for a quarter of an hour or more when suddenly there come a noise like people struggle inside the house
next moment the door be fling open and two men appear one of whom be drebber and the other be a young chap whom i have never see before
this fellow have drebber by the collar and when they come to the head of the step he give him a shove and a kick which send him half across the road
'you hound ' he cry shake his stick at him 'i'll teach you to insult an honest girl '
he be so hot that i think he would have thrash drebber with his cudgel only that the cur stagger away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him
he run as far as the corner and then see my cab he hail me and jump in
'drive me to halliday's private hotel ' say he
when i have him fairly inside my cab my heart jump so with joy that i fear lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong
i drive along slowly weigh in my own mind what it be best to do
i might take him right out into the country and there in some desert lane have my last interview with him
i have almost decide upon this when he solve the problem for me
the craze for drink have seize him again and he order me to pull up outside a gin palace
he go in leave word that i should wait for him
there he remain until close time and when he come out he be so far go that i know the game be in my own hand
don't imagine that i intend to kill him in cold blood
it would only have be rigid justice if i have do so but i could not bring myself to do it
i have long determine that he should have a show for his life if he choose to take advantage of it
among the many billet which i have fill in america during my wander life i be once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at york college
one day the professor be lecture on poisions and he show his students some alkaloid as he call it which he have extract from some south american arrow poison and which be so powerful that the least grain mean instant death
i spot the bottle in which this preparation be keep and when they be all go i help myself to a little of it
i be a fairly good dispenser so i work this alkaloid into small soluble pills and each pill i put in a box with a similar pill make without the poison
i determine at the time that when i have my chance my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these box while i eat the pill that remain
it would be quite as deadly and a good deal less noisy than fire across a handkerchief
from that day i have always my pill box about with me and the time have now come when i be to use them
it be nearer one than twelve and a wild bleak night blow hard and rain in torrents
dismal as it be outside i be glad within so glad that i could have shout out from pure exultation
if any of you gentlemen have ever pin for a thing and long for it during twenty long years and then suddenly find it within your reach you would understand my feel
i light a cigar and puff at it to steady my nerve but my hand be tremble and my temples throb with excitement
as i drive i could see old john ferrier and sweet lucy look at me out of the darkness and smile at me just as plain as i see you all in this room
all the way they be ahead of me one on each side of the horse until i pull up at the house in the brixton road
there be not a soul to be see nor a sound to be hear except the drip of the rain
when i look in at the window i find drebber all huddle together in a drunken sleep
i shake him by the arm 'it's time to get out ' i say
'all right cabby ' say he
i suppose he think we have come to the hotel that he have mention for he get out without another word and follow me down the garden
i have to walk beside him to keep him steady for he be still a little top heavy
when we come to the door i open it and lead him into the front room
i give you my word that all the way the father and the daughter be walk in front of us
'it's infernally dark ' say he stamp about
'we'll soon have a light ' i say strike a match and put it to a wax candle which i have bring with me
'now enoch drebber ' i continue turn to him and hold the light to my own face 'who be i '
he gaze at me with blear drunken eye for a moment and then i saw a horror spring up in them and convulse his whole feature which show me that he know me
he stagger back with a livid face and i saw the perspiration break out upon his brow while his teeth chatter in his head
at the sight i lean my back against the door and laugh loud and long
i have always know that vengeance would be sweet but i have never hop for the contentment of soul which now possess me
'you dog '
i say 'i have hunt you from salt lake city to st
petersburg and you have always escape me
now at last your wander have come to an end for either you or i shall never see to morrow's sun rise '
he shrink still further away as i speak and i could see on his face that he think i be mad
so i be for the time
the pulse in my temples beat like sledge hammer and i believe i would have have a fit of some sort if the blood have not gush from my nose and relieve me
'what do you think of lucy ferrier now '
i cry lock the door and shake the key in his face
'punishment have be slow in come but it have overtake you at last '
i saw his coward lips tremble as i speak
he would have beg for his life but he know well that it be useless
'would you murder me '
he stammer
'there be no murder ' i answer
'who talk of murder a mad dog
what mercy have you upon my poor darling when you drag her from her slaughter father and bore her away to your accurse and shameless harem '
'it be not i who kill her father ' he cry
'but it be you who break her innocent heart ' i shriek thrust the box before him
'let the high god judge between us
choose and eat
there be death in one and life in the other
i shall take what you leave
let us see if there be justice upon the earth or if we be rule by chance '
he cower away with wild cry and prayers for mercy but i draw my knife and hold it to his throat until he have obey me
then i swallow the other and we stand face one another in silence for a minute or more wait to see which be to live and which be to die
shall i ever forget the look which come over his face when the first warn pangs tell him that the poison be in his system
i laugh as i saw it and hold lucy's marriage ring in front of his eye
it be but for a moment for the action of the alkaloid be rapid
a spasm of pain contort his feature he throw his hand out in front of him stagger and then with a hoarse cry fell heavily upon the floor
i turn him over with my foot and place my hand upon his heart
there be no movement
he be dead
the blood have be stream from my nose but i have take no notice of it
i don't know what it be that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it
perhaps it be some mischievous idea of set the police upon a wrong track for i felt light hearted and cheerful
i remember a german be find in new york with rache write up above him and it be argue at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must have do it
i guess that what puzzle the new yorkers would puzzle the londoners so i dip my finger in my own blood and print it on a convenient place on the wall
then i walk down to my cab and find that there be nobody about and that the night be still very wild
i have drive some distance when i put my hand into the pocket in which i usually keep lucy's ring and find that it be not there
i be thunderstruck at this for it be the only memento that i have of her
think that i might have drop it when i stoop over drebber's body i drive back and leave my cab in a side street i go boldly up to the house for i be ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring
when i arrive there i walk right into the arm of a police officer who be come out and only manage to disarm his suspicions by pretend to be hopelessly drink
that be how enoch drebber come to his end
all i have to do then be to do as much for stangerson and so pay off john ferrier's debt
i know that he be stay at halliday's private hotel and i hang about all day but he never come out
fancy that he suspect something when drebber fail to put in an appearance
he be cunning be stangerson and always on his guard
if he think he could keep me off by stay indoors he be very much mistake
i soon find out which be the window of his bedroom and early next morning i take advantage of some ladder which be lie in the lane behind the hotel and so make my way into his room in the grey of the dawn
i wake him up and tell him that the hour have come when he be to answer for the life he have take so long before
i describe drebber's death to him and i give him the same choice of the poison pills
instead of grasp at the chance of safety which that offer him he spring from his bed and fly at my throat
in self defence i stab him to the heart
it would have be the same in any case for providence would never have allow his guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison
i have little more to say and it's as well for i be about do up
i go on cabbing it for a day or so intend to keep at it until i could save enough to take me back to america
i be stand in the yard when a rag youngster ask if there be a cabby there call jefferson hope and say that his cab be want by a gentleman at 221b baker street
i go round suspect no harm and the next thing i know this young man here have the bracelets on my wrists and as neatly snackled as ever i saw in my life
that's the whole of my story gentlemen
you may consider me to be a murderer but i hold that i be just as much an officer of justice as you be
so thrill have the man's narrative be and his manner be so impressive that we have sit silent and absorb
even the professional detectives _blase_ as they be in every detail of crime appear to be keenly interest in the man's story
when he finish we sit for some minutes in a stillness which be only break by the scratch of lestrade's pencil as he give the finish touch to his shorthand account
there be only one point on which i should like a little more information sherlock holmes say at last
who be your accomplice who come for the ring which i advertise
the prisoner wink at my friend jocosely
i can tell my own secrets he say but i don't get other people into trouble
i saw your advertisement and i think it might be a plant or it might be the ring which i want
my friend volunteer to go and see
i think you'll own he do it smartly
not a doubt of that say holmes heartily
now gentlemen the inspector remark gravely the form of the law must be comply with
on thursday the prisoner will be bring before the magistrates and your attendance will be require
until then i will be responsible for him
he ring the bell as he speak and jefferson hope be lead off by a couple of warders while my friend and i make our way out of the station and take a cab back to baker street
we have all be warn to appear before the magistrates upon the thursday but when the thursday come there be no occasion for our testimony
a higher judge have take the matter in hand and jefferson hope have be summon before a tribunal where strict justice would be meted out to him
on the very night after his capture the aneurism burst and he be find in the morning stretch upon the floor of the cell with a placid smile upon his face as though he have be able in his die moments to look back upon a useful life and on work well do
gregson and lestrade will be wild about his death holmes remark as we chat it over next even
where will their grand advertisement be now
i don't see that they have very much to do with his capture i answer
what you do in this world be a matter of no consequence return my companion bitterly
the question be what can you make people believe that you have do
never mind he continue more brightly after a pause
i would not have miss the investigation for anything
there have be no better case within my recollection
simple as it be there be several most instructive point about it
simple
i ejaculate
well really it can hardly be describe as otherwise say sherlock holmes smile at my surprise
the proof of its intrinsic simplicity be that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions i be able to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days
that be true say i
i have already explain to you that what be out of the common be usually a guide rather than a hindrance
in solve a problem of this sort the grand thing be to be able to reason backwards
that be a very useful accomplishment and a very easy one but people do not practise it much
in the every day affairs of life it be more useful to reason forward and so the other come to be neglect
there be fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically
i confess say i that i do not quite follow you
i hardly expect that you would
let me see if i can make it clearer
most people if you describe a train of events to them will tell you what the result would be
they can put those events together in their mind and argue from them that something will come to pass
there be few people however who if you tell them a result would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the step be which lead up to that result
this power be what i mean when i talk of reason backwards or analytically
i understand say i
now this be a case in which you be give the result and have to find everything else for yourself
now let me endeavour to show you the different step in my reason
to begin at the begin
i approach the house as you know on foot and with my mind entirely free from all impressions
i naturally begin by examine the roadway and there as i have already explain to you i saw clearly the mark of a cab which i ascertain by inquiry must have be there during the night
i satisfy myself that it be a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheel
the ordinary london growler be considerably less wide than a gentleman's brougham
this be the first point gain
i then walk slowly down the garden path which happen to be compose of a clay soil peculiarly suitable for take impressions
no doubt it appear to you to be a mere trample line of slush but to my train eye every mark upon its surface have a mean
there be no branch of detective science which be so important and so much neglect as the art of trace footsteps
happily i have always lay great stress upon it and much practice have make it second nature to me
i saw the heavy footmarks of the constables but i saw also the track of the two men who have first pass through the garden
it be easy to tell that they have be before the others because in place their mark have be entirely obliterate by the others come upon the top of them
in this way my second link be form which tell me that the nocturnal visitors be two in number one remarkable for his height as i calculate from the length of his stride and the other fashionably dress to judge from the small and elegant impression leave by his boot
on enter the house this last inference be confirm
my well boot man lay before me
the tall one then have do the murder if murder there be
there be no wind upon the dead man's person but the agitate expression upon his face assure me that he have foresee his fate before it come upon him
men who die from heart disease or any sudden natural cause never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their feature
have sniff the dead man's lips i detect a slightly sour smell and i come to the conclusion that he have have poison force upon him
again i argue that it have be force upon him from the hatred and fear express upon his face
by the method of exclusion i have arrive at this result for no other hypothesis would meet the facts
do not imagine that it be a very unheard of idea
the forcible administration of poison be by no mean a new thing in criminal annals
the case of dolsky in odessa and of leturier in montpellier will occur at once to any toxicologist
and now come the great question as to the reason why
robbery have not be the object of the murder for nothing be take
be it politics then or be it a woman
that be the question which confront me
i be incline from the first to the latter supposition
political assassins be only too glad to do their work and to fly
this murder have on the contrary be do most deliberately and the perpetrator have leave his track all over the room show that he have be there all the time
it must have be a private wrong and not a political one which call for such a methodical revenge
when the inscription be discover upon the wall i be more incline than ever to my opinion
the thing be too evidently a blind
when the ring be find however it settle the question
clearly the murderer have use it to remind his victim of some dead or absent woman
it be at this point that i ask gregson whether he have enquire in his telegram to cleveland as to any particular point in mr
drebber's former career
he answer you remember in the negative
i then proceed to make a careful examination of the room which confirm me in my opinion as to the murderer's height and furnish me with the additional detail as to the trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nail
i have already come to the conclusion since there be no sign of a struggle that the blood which cover the floor have burst from the murderer's nose in his excitement
i could perceive that the track of blood coincide with the track of his feet
it be seldom that any man unless he be very full blood break out in this way through emotion so i hazard the opinion that the criminal be probably a robust and ruddy face man
events prove that i have judge correctly
have leave the house i proceed to do what gregson have neglect
i telegraph to the head of the police at cleveland limit my enquiry to the circumstances connect with the marriage of enoch drebber
the answer be conclusive
it tell me that drebber have already apply for the protection of the law against an old rival in love name jefferson hope and that this same hope be at present in europe
i know now that i hold the clue to the mystery in my hand and all that remain be to secure the murderer
i have already determine in my own mind that the man who have walk into the house with drebber be none other than the man who have drive the cab
the mark in the road show me that the horse have wander on in a way which would have be impossible have there be anyone in charge of it
where then could the driver be unless he be inside the house
again it be absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very eye as it be of a third person who be sure to betray him
lastly suppose one man wish to dog another through london what better mean could he adopt than to turn cabdriver
all these considerations lead me to the irresistible conclusion that jefferson hope be to be find among the jarveys of the metropolis
if he have be one there be no reason to believe that he have cease to be
on the contrary from his point of view any sudden change would be likely to draw attention to himself
he would probably for a time at least continue to perform his duties
there be no reason to suppose that he be go under an assume name
why should he change his name in a country where no one know his original one
i therefore organize my street arab detective corps and send them systematically to every cab proprietor in london until they ferret out the man that i want
how well they succeed and how quickly i take advantage of it be still fresh in your recollection
the murder of stangerson be an incident which be entirely unexpected but which could hardly in any case have be prevent
through it as you know i come into possession of the pills the existence of which i have already surmise
you see the whole thing be a chain of logical sequence without a break or flaw
it be wonderful
i cry
your merit should be publicly recognize
you should publish an account of the case
if you won't i will for you
you may do what you like doctor he answer
see here
he continue hand a paper over to me look at this
it be the _echo_ for the day and the paragraph to which he point be devote to the case in question
the public it say have lose a sensational treat through the sudden death of the man hope who be suspect of the murder of mr
enoch drebber and of mr
joseph stangerson
the detail of the case will probably be never know now though we be inform upon good authority that the crime be the result of an old stand and romantic feud in which love and mormonism bore a part
it seem that both the victims belong in their younger days to the latter day saint and hope the decease prisoner hail also from salt lake city
if the case have have no other effect it at least bring out in the most strike manner the efficiency of our detective police force and will serve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feud at home and not to carry them on to british soil
it be an open secret that the credit of this smart capture belong entirely to the well know scotland yard officials messrs
lestrade and gregson
the man be apprehend it appear in the room of a certain mr
sherlock holmes who have himself as an amateur show some talent in the detective line and who with such instructors may hope in time to attain to some degree of their skill
it be expect that a testimonial of some sort will be present to the two officer as a fit recognition of their service
didn't i tell you so when we start
cry sherlock holmes with a laugh
that's the result of all our study in scarlet to get them a testimonial
never mind i answer i have all the facts in my journal and the public shall know them
in the meantime you must make yourself content by the consciousness of success like the roman miser 'populus me sibilat at mihi plaudo ipse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca '
sherlock holmes take his bottle from the corner of the mantel piece and his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case
with his long white nervous finger he adjust the delicate needle and roll back his leave shirt cuff
for some little time his eye rest thoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dot and scar with innumerable puncture mark
finally he thrust the sharp point home press down the tiny piston and sink back into the velvet line arm chair with a long sigh of satisfaction
three time a day for many months i have witness this performance but custom have not reconcile my mind to it
on the contrary from day to day i have become more irritable at the sight and my conscience swell nightly within me at the think that i have lack the courage to protest
again and again i have register a vow that i should deliver my soul upon the subject but there be that in the cool nonchalant air of my companion which make him the last man with whom one would care to take anything approach to a liberty
his great power his masterly manner and the experience which i have have of his many extraordinary qualities all make me diffident and backward in cross him
yet upon that afternoon whether it be the beaune which i have take with my lunch or the additional exasperation produce by the extreme deliberation of his manner i suddenly felt that i could hold out no longer
which be it to day
i ask morphine or cocaine
he raise his eye languidly from the old black letter volume which he have open
it be cocaine he say a seven per cent
solution
would you care to try it
no indeed i answer brusquely
my constitution have not get over the afghan campaign yet
i cannot afford to throw any extra strain upon it
he smile at my vehemence
perhaps you be right watson he say
i suppose that its influence be physically a bad one
i find it however so transcendently stimulate and clarify to the mind that its secondary action be a matter of small moment
but consider
i say earnestly
count the cost
your brain may as you say be rouse and excite but it be a pathological and morbid process which involve increase tissue change and may at last leave a permanent weakness
you know too what a black reaction come upon you
surely the game be hardly worth the candle
why should you for a mere pass pleasure risk the loss of those great power with which you have be endow
remember that i speak not only as one comrade to another but as a medical man to one for whose constitution he be to some extent answerable
he do not seem offend
on the contrary he put his finger tip together and lean his elbow on the arm of his chair like one who have a relish for conversation
my mind he say rebel at stagnation
give me problems give me work give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate analysis and i be in my own proper atmosphere
i can dispense then with artificial stimulants
but i abhor the dull routine of existence
i crave for mental exaltation
that be why i have choose my own particular profession or rather create it for i be the only one in the world
the only unofficial detective
i say raise my eyebrows
the only unofficial consult detective he answer
i be the last and highest court of appeal in detection
when gregson or lestrade or athelney jones be out of their depths which by the way be their normal state the matter be lay before me
i examine the data as an expert and pronounce a specialist's opinion
i claim no credit in such case
my name figure in no newspaper
the work itself the pleasure of find a field for my peculiar power be my highest reward
but you have yourself have some experience of my methods of work in the jefferson hope case
yes indeed say i cordially
i be never so strike by anything in my life
i even embody it in a small brochure with the somewhat fantastic title of 'a study in scarlet '
he shake his head sadly
i glance over it say he
honestly i cannot congratulate you upon it
detection be or ought to be an exact science and should be treat in the same cold and unemotional manner
you have attempt to tinge it with romanticism which produce much the same effect as if you work a love story or an elopement into the fifth proposition of euclid
but the romance be there i remonstrate
i could not tamper with the facts
some facts should be suppress or at least a just sense of proportion should be observe in treat them
the only point in the case which deserve mention be the curious analytical reason from effect to cause by which i succeed in unravel it
i be annoy at this criticism of a work which have be specially design to please him
i confess too that i be irritate by the egotism which seem to demand that every line of my pamphlet should be devote to his own special do
more than once during the years that i have live with him in baker street i have observe that a small vanity underlay my companion's quiet and didactic manner
i make no remark however but sit nurse my wound leg
i have a jezail bullet through it some time before and though it do not prevent me from walk it ache wearily at every change of the weather
my practice have extend recently to the continent say holmes after a while fill up his old brier root pipe
i be consult last week by francois le villard who as you probably know have come rather to the front lately in the french detective service
he have all the celtic power of quick intuition but he be deficient in the wide range of exact knowledge which be essential to the higher developments of his art
the case be concern with a will and possess some feature of interest
i be able to refer him to two parallel case the one at riga in and the other at st
louis in which have suggest to him the true solution
here be the letter which i have this morning acknowledge my assistance
he toss over as he speak a crumple sheet of foreign notepaper
i glance my eye down it catch a profusion of note of admiration with stray magnifiques coup de maitres and tour de force all testify to the ardent admiration of the frenchman
he speak as a pupil to his master say i
oh he rat my assistance too highly say sherlock holmes lightly
he have considerable gift himself
he possess two out of the three qualities necessary for the ideal detective
he have the power of observation and that of deduction
he be only want in knowledge and that may come in time
he be now translate my small work into french
your work
oh didn't you know
he cry laugh
yes i have be guilty of several monographs
they be all upon technical subject
here for example be one 'upon the distinction between the ash of the various tobaccoes '
in it i enumerate a hundred and forty form of cigar cigarette and pipe tobacco with color plat illustrate the difference in the ash
it be a point which be continually turn up in criminal trials and which be sometimes of supreme importance as a clue
if you can say definitely for example that some murder have be do by a man who be smoke an indian lunkah it obviously narrow your field of search
to the train eye there be as much difference between the black ash of a trichinopoly and the white fluff of bird's eye as there be between a cabbage and a potato
you have an extraordinary genius for minutiae i remark
i appreciate their importance
here be my monograph upon the trace of footsteps with some remark upon the use of plaster of paris as a preserver of impress
here too be a curious little work upon the influence of a trade upon the form of the hand with lithotypes of the hand of slaters sailors corkcutters compositors weavers and diamond polishers
that be a matter of great practical interest to the scientific detective especially in case of unclaimed body or in discover the antecedents of criminals
but i weary you with my hobby
not at all i answer earnestly
it be of the greatest interest to me especially since i have have the opportunity of observe your practical application of it
but you speak just now of observation and deduction
surely the one to some extent imply the other
why hardly he answer lean back luxuriously in his arm chair and send up thick blue wreaths from his pipe
for example observation show me that you have be to the wigmore street post office this morning but deduction let me know that when there you dispatch a telegram
right
say i
right on both point
but i confess that i don't see how you arrive at it
it be a sudden impulse upon my part and i have mention it to no one
it be simplicity itself he remark chuckle at my surprise so absurdly simple that an explanation be superfluous and yet it may serve to define the limit of observation and of deduction
observation tell me that you have a little reddish mould adhere to your instep
just opposite the seymour street office they have take up the pavement and throw up some earth which lie in such a way that it be difficult to avoid tread in it in enter
the earth be of this peculiar reddish tint which be find as far as i know nowhere else in the neighborhood
so much be observation
the rest be deduction
how then do you deduce the telegram
why of course i know that you have not write a letter since i sit opposite to you all morning
i see also in your open desk there that you have a sheet of stamp and a thick bundle of post card
what could you go into the post office for then but to send a wire
eliminate all other factor and the one which remain must be the truth
in this case it certainly be so i reply after a little think
the thing however be as you say of the simplest
would you think me impertinent if i be to put your theories to a more severe test
on the contrary he answer it would prevent me from take a second dose of cocaine
i should be delight to look into any problem which you might submit to me
i have hear you say that it be difficult for a man to have any object in daily use without leave the impress of his individuality upon it in such a way that a train observer might read it
now i have here a watch which have recently come into my possession
would you have the kindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habit of the late owner
i hand him over the watch with some slight feel of amusement in my heart for the test be as i think an impossible one and i intend it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he occasionally assume
he balance the watch in his hand gaze hard at the dial open the back and examine the work first with his naked eye and then with a powerful convex lens
i could hardly keep from smile at his crestfallen face when he finally snap the case to and hand it back
there be hardly any data he remark
the watch have be recently clean which rob me of my most suggestive facts
you be right i answer
it be clean before be send to me
in my heart i accuse my companion of put forward a most lame and impotent excuse to cover his failure
what data could he expect from an uncleaned watch
though unsatisfactory my research have not be entirely barren he observe star up at the ceiling with dreamy lack lustre eye
subject to your correction i should judge that the watch belong to your elder brother who inherit it from your father
that you gather no doubt from the h w upon the back
quite so
the w suggest your own name
the date of the watch be nearly fifty years back and the initial be as old as the watch so it be make for the last generation
jewelry usually descend to the eldest son and he be most likely to have the same name as the father
your father have if i remember right be dead many years
it have therefore be in the hand of your eldest brother
right so far say i
anything else
he be a man of untidy habit very untidy and careless
he be leave with good prospect but he throw away his chance live for some time in poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity and finally take to drink he die
that be all i can gather
i spring from my chair and limp impatiently about the room with considerable bitterness in my heart
this be unworthy of you holmes i say
i could not have believe that you would have descend to this
you have make inquire into the history of my unhappy brother and you now pretend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful way
you cannot expect me to believe that you have read all this from his old watch
it be unkind and to speak plainly have a touch of charlatanism in it
my dear doctor say he kindly pray accept my apologies
view the matter as an abstract problem i have forget how personal and painful a thing it might be to you
i assure you however that i never even know that you have a brother until you hand me the watch
then how in the name of all that be wonderful do you get these facts
they be absolutely correct in every particular
ah that be good luck
i could only say what be the balance of probability
i do not at all expect to be so accurate
but it be not mere guess work
no no i never guess
it be a shock habit destructive to the logical faculty
what seem strange to you be only so because you do not follow my train of think or observe the small facts upon which large inferences may depend
for example i begin by state that your brother be careless
when you observe the lower part of that watch case you notice that it be not only dinted in two place but it be cut and mark all over from the habit of keep other hard object such as coin or key in the same pocket
surely it be no great feat to assume that a man who treat a fifty guinea watch so cavalierly must be a careless man
neither be it a very far fetch inference that a man who inherit one article of such value be pretty well provide for in other respect
i nod to show that i follow his reason
it be very customary for pawnbrokers in england when they take a watch to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin point upon the inside of the case
it be more handy than a label as there be no risk of the number be lose or transpose
there be no less than four such number visible to my lens on the inside of this case
inference that your brother be often at low water
secondary inference that he have occasional burst of prosperity or he could not have redeem the pledge
finally i ask you to look at the inner plate which contain the key hole
look at the thousands of scratch all round the hole mark where the key have slip
what sober man's key could have score those groove
but you will never see a drunkard's watch without them
he wind it at night and he leave these trace of his unsteady hand
where be the mystery in all this
it be as clear as daylight i answer
i regret the injustice which i do you
i should have have more faith in your marvellous faculty
may i ask whether you have any professional inquiry on foot at present
none
hence the cocaine
i cannot live without brain work
what else be there to live for
stand at the window here
be ever such a dreary dismal unprofitable world
see how the yellow fog swirl down the street and drift across the dun color house
what could be more hopelessly prosaic and material
what be the use of have power doctor when one have no field upon which to exert them
crime be commonplace existence be commonplace and no qualities save those which be commonplace have any function upon earth
i have open my mouth to reply to this tirade when with a crisp knock our landlady enter bear a card upon the brass salver
a young lady for you sir she say address my companion
miss mary morstan he read
hum
i have no recollection of the name
ask the young lady to step up mrs
hudson
don't go doctor
i should prefer that you remain
miss morstan enter the room with a firm step and an outward composure of manner
she be a blonde young lady small dainty well gloved and dress in the most perfect taste
there be however a plainness and simplicity about her costume which bore with it a suggestion of limit mean
the dress be a sombre grayish beige untrimmed and unbraid and she wear a small turban of the same dull hue relieve only by a suspicion of white feather in the side
her face have neither regularity of feature nor beauty of complexion but her expression be sweet and amiable and her large blue eye be singularly spiritual and sympathetic
in an experience of women which extend over many nations and three separate continents i have never look upon a face which give a clearer promise of a refine and sensitive nature
i could not but observe that as she take the seat which sherlock holmes place for her her lip tremble her hand quiver and she show every sign of intense inward agitation
i have come to you mr
holmes she say because you once enable my employer mrs
cecil forrester to unravel a little domestic complication
she be much impress by your kindness and skill
mrs
cecil forrester he repeat thoughtfully
i believe that i be of some slight service to her
the case however as i remember it be a very simple one
she do not think so
but at least you cannot say the same of mine
i can hardly imagine anything more strange more utterly inexplicable than the situation in which i find myself
holmes rub his hand and his eye glisten
he lean forward in his chair with an expression of extraordinary concentration upon his clear cut hawklike feature
state your case say he in brisk business tone
i felt that my position be an embarrass one
you will i be sure excuse me i say rise from my chair
to my surprise the young lady hold up her gloved hand to detain me
if your friend she say would be good enough to stop he might be of inestimable service to me
i relapse into my chair
briefly she continue the facts be these
my father be an officer in an indian regiment who send me home when i be quite a child
my mother be dead and i have no relative in england
i be place however in a comfortable board establishment at edinburgh and there i remain until i be seventeen years of age
in the year my father who be senior captain of his regiment obtain twelve months' leave and come home
he telegraph to me from london that he have arrive all safe and direct me to come down at once give the langham hotel as his address
his message as i remember be full of kindness and love
on reach london i drive to the langham and be inform that captain morstan be stay there but that he have go out the night before and have not yet return
i wait all day without news of him
that night on the advice of the manager of the hotel i communicate with the police and next morning we advertise in all the paper
our inquiries lead to no result and from that day to this no word have ever be hear of my unfortunate father
he come home with his heart full of hope to find some peace some comfort and instead she put her hand to her throat and a choke sob cut short the sentence
the date
ask holmes open his note book
he disappear upon the 3d of december nearly ten years ago
his luggage
remain at the hotel
there be nothing in it to suggest a clue some clothe some book and a considerable number of curiosities from the andaman islands
he have be one of the officer in charge of the convict guard there
have he any friends in town
only one that we know of major sholto of his own regiment the 34th bombay infantry
the major have retire some little time before and live at upper norwood
we communicate with him of course but he do not even know that his brother officer be in england
a singular case remark holmes
i have not yet describe to you the most singular part
about six years ago to be exact upon the 4th of may an advertisement appear in the time ask for the address of miss mary morstan and state that it would be to her advantage to come forward
there be no name or address append
i have at that time just enter the family of mrs
cecil forrester in the capacity of govern
by her advice i publish my address in the advertisement column
the same day there arrive through the post a small card board box address to me which i find to contain a very large and lustrous pearl
no word of write be enclose
since then every year upon the same date there have always appear a similar box contain a similar pearl without any clue as to the sender
they have be pronounce by an expert to be of a rare variety and of considerable value
you can see for yourselves that they be very handsome
she open a flat box as she speak and show me six of the finest pearl that i have ever see
your statement be most interest say sherlock holmes
have anything else occur to you
yes and no later than to day
that be why i have come to you
this morning i receive this letter which you will perhaps read for yourself
thank you say holmes
the envelope too please
postmark london s w
date july
hum
man's thumb mark on corner probably postman
best quality paper
envelop at sixpence a packet
particular man in his stationery
no address
'be at the third pillar from the leave outside the lyceum theatre to night at seven o'clock
if you be distrustful bring two friends
you be a wrong woman and shall have justice
do not bring police
if you do all will be in vain
your unknown friend '
well really this be a very pretty little mystery
what do you intend to do miss morstan
that be exactly what i want to ask you
then we shall most certainly go
you and i and yes why dr
watson be the very man
your correspondent say two friends
he and i have work together before
but would he come
she ask with something appeal in her voice and expression
i should be proud and happy say i fervently if i can be of any service
you be both very kind she answer
i have lead a retire life and have no friends whom i could appeal to
if i be here at six it will do i suppose
you must not be later say holmes
there be one other point however
be this handwrite the same as that upon the pearl box address
i have them here she answer produce half a dozen piece of paper
you be certainly a model client
you have the correct intuition
let us see now
he spread out the paper upon the table and give little dart glance from one to the other
they be disguise hand except the letter he say presently but there can be no question as to the authorship
see how the irrepressible greek e will break out and see the twirl of the final s they be undoubtedly by the same person
i should not like to suggest false hop miss morstan but be there any resemblance between this hand and that of your father
nothing could be more unlike
i expect to hear you say so
we shall look out for you then at six
pray allow me to keep the paper
i may look into the matter before then
it be only half past three
au revoir then
au revoir say our visitor and with a bright kindly glance from one to the other of us she replace her pearl box in her bosom and hurry away
stand at the window i watch her walk briskly down the street until the gray turban and white feather be but a speck in the sombre crowd
what a very attractive woman
i exclaim turn to my companion
he have light his pipe again and be lean back with droop eyelids
be she
he say languidly
i do not observe
you really be an automaton a calculate machine
i cry
there be something positively inhuman in you at time
he smile gently
it be of the first importance he say not to allow your judgment to be bias by personal qualities
a client be to me a mere unit a factor in a problem
the emotional qualities be antagonistic to clear reason
i assure you that the most win woman i ever know be hang for poison three little children for their insurance money and the most repellant man of my acquaintance be a philanthropist who have spend nearly a quarter of a million upon the london poor
in this case however i never make exceptions
an exception disprove the rule
have you ever have occasion to study character in handwrite
what do you make of this fellow's scribble
it be legible and regular i answer
a man of business habit and some force of character
holmes shake his head
look at his long letter he say
they hardly rise above the common herd
that d might be an a and that l an e men of character always differentiate their long letter however illegibly they may write
there be vacillation in his k's and self esteem in his capitals
i be go out now
i have some few reference to make
let me recommend this book one of the most remarkable ever pen
it be winwood reade's 'martyrdom of man '
i shall be back in an hour
i sit in the window with the volume in my hand but my thoughts be far from the dare speculations of the writer
my mind run upon our late visitor her smile the deep rich tone of her voice the strange mystery which overhang her life
if she be seventeen at the time of her father's disappearance she must be seven and twenty now a sweet age when youth have lose its self consciousness and become a little sober by experience
so i sit and muse until such dangerous thoughts come into my head that i hurry away to my desk and plunge furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology
what be i an army surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker bank account that i should dare to think of such things
she be a unit a factor nothing more
if my future be black it be better surely to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will o' the wisps of the imagination
it be half past five before holmes return
he be bright eager and in excellent spirit a mood which in his case alternate with fit of the blackest depression
there be no great mystery in this matter he say take the cup of tea which i have pour out for him
the facts appear to admit of only one explanation
what
you have solve it already
well that would be too much to say
i have discover a suggestive fact that be all
it be however very suggestive
the detail be still to be add
i have just find on consult the back file of the time that major sholto of upper norword late of the 34th bombay infantry die upon the 28th of april
i may be very obtuse holmes but i fail to see what this suggest
no
you surprise me
look at it in this way then
captain morstan disappear
the only person in london whom he could have visit be major sholto
major sholto deny have hear that he be in london
four years later sholto die
within a week of his death captain morstan's daughter receive a valuable present which be repeat from year to year and now culminate in a letter which describe her as a wrong woman
what wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her father
and why should the present begin immediately after sholto's death unless it be that sholto's heir know something of the mystery and desire to make compensation
have you any alternative theory which will meet the facts
but what a strange compensation
and how strangely make
why too should he write a letter now rather than six years ago
again the letter speak of give her justice
what justice can she have
it be too much to suppose that her father be still alive
there be no other injustice in her case that you know of
there be difficulties there be certainly difficulties say sherlock holmes pensively
but our expedition of to night will solve them all
ah here be a four wheeler and miss morstan be inside
be you all ready
then we have better go down for it be a little past the hour
i pick up my hat and my heaviest stick but i observe that holmes take his revolver from his drawer and slip it into his pocket
it be clear that he think that our night's work might be a serious one
miss morstan be muffle in a dark cloak and her sensitive face be compose but pale
she must have be more than woman if she do not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we be embark yet her self control be perfect and she readily answer the few additional question which sherlock holmes put to her
major sholto be a very particular friend of papa's she say
his letter be full of allusions to the major
he and papa be in command of the troop at the andaman islands so they be throw a great deal together
by the way a curious paper be find in papa's desk which no one could understand
i don't suppose that it be of the slightest importance but i think you might care to see it so i bring it with me
it be here
holmes unfold the paper carefully and smooth it out upon his knee
he then very methodically examine it all over with his double lens
it be paper of native indian manufacture he remark
it have at some time be pin to a board
the diagram upon it appear to be a plan of part of a large build with numerous halls corridors and passages
at one point be a small cross do in red ink and above it be ' from leave ' in fade pencil write
in the leave hand corner be a curious hieroglyphic like four cross in a line with their arm touch
beside it be write in very rough and coarse character 'the sign of the four jonathan small mahomet singh abdullah khan dost akbar '
no i confess that i do not see how this bear upon the matter
yet it be evidently a document of importance
it have be keep carefully in a pocket book for the one side be as clean as the other
it be in his pocket book that we find it
preserve it carefully then miss morstan for it may prove to be of use to us
i begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much deeper and more subtle than i at first suppose
i must reconsider my ideas
he lean back in the cab and i could see by his draw brow and his vacant eye that he be think intently
miss morstan and i chat in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible outcome but our companion maintain his impenetrable reserve until the end of our journey
it be a september even and not yet seven o'clock but the day have be a dreary one and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city
mud color cloud droop sadly over the muddy streets
down the strand the lamps be but misty splotch of diffuse light which throw a feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement
the yellow glare from the shop windows stream out into the steamy vaporous air and throw a murky shift radiance across the crowd thoroughfare
there be to my mind something eerie and ghost like in the endless procession of face which flit across these narrow bar of light sad face and glad haggard and merry
like all human kind they flit from the gloom into the light and so back into the gloom once more
i be not subject to impressions but the dull heavy even with the strange business upon which we be engage combine to make me nervous and depress
i could see from miss morstan's manner that she be suffer from the same feel
holmes alone could rise superior to petty influence
he hold his open note book upon his knee and from time to time he jot down figure and memoranda in the light of his pocket lantern
at the lyceum theatre the crowd be already thick at the side entrance
in front a continuous stream of hansoms and four wheelers be rattle up discharge their cargoes of shirt front men and beshawled bediamonded women
we have hardly reach the third pillar which be our rendezvous before a small dark brisk man in the dress of a coachman accost us
be you the party who come with miss morstan
he ask
i be miss morstan and these two gentlemen be my friends say she
he bend a pair of wonderfully penetrate and question eye upon us
you will excuse me miss he say with a certain dog manner but i be to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companion be a police officer
i give you my word on that she answer
he give a shrill whistle on which a street arab lead across a four wheeler and open the door
the man who have address us mount to the box while we take our place inside
we have hardly do so before the driver whip up his horse and we plunge away at a furious pace through the foggy streets
the situation be a curious one
we be drive to an unknown place on an unknown errand
yet our invitation be either a complete hoax which be an inconceivable hypothesis or else we have good reason to think that important issue might hang upon our journey
miss morstan's demeanor be as resolute and collect as ever
i endeavor to cheer and amuse her by reminiscences of my adventure in afghanistan but to tell the truth i be myself so excite at our situation and so curious as to our destination that my stories be slightly involve
to this day she declare that i tell her one move anecdote as to how a musket look into my tent at the dead of night and how i fire a double barrel tiger cub at it
at first i have some idea as to the direction in which we be drive but soon what with our pace the fog and my own limit knowledge of london i lose my bear and know nothing save that we seem to be go a very long way
sherlock holmes be never at fault however and he mutter the name as the cab rattle through square and in and out by tortuous by streets
rochester row say he
now vincent square
now we come out on the vauxhall bridge road
we be make for the surrey side apparently
yes i think so
now we be on the bridge
you can catch glimpse of the river
we do indeed get a fleet view of a stretch of the thames with the lamps shin upon the broad silent water but our cab dash on and be soon involve in a labyrinth of streets upon the other side
wordsworth road say my companion
priory road
lark hall lane
stockwell place
robert street
cold harbor lane
our quest do not appear to take us to very fashionable regions
we have indeed reach a questionable and forbid neighborhood
long line of dull brick house be only relieve by the coarse glare and tawdry brilliancy of public house at the corner
then come row of two storied villas each with a front of miniature garden and then again interminable line of new star brick build the monster tentacles which the giant city be throw out into the country
at last the cab draw up at the third house in a new terrace
none of the other house be inhabit and that at which we stop be as dark as its neighbor save for a single glimmer in the kitchen window
on our knock however the door be instantly throw open by a hindoo servant clothe in a yellow turban white loose fit clothe and a yellow sash
there be something strangely incongruous in this oriental figure frame in the commonplace door way of a third rate suburban dwell house
the sahib await you say he and even as he speak there come a high pip voice from some inner room
show them in to me khitmutgar it cry
show them straight in to me
we follow the indian down a sordid and common passage ill light and worse furnish until he come to a door upon the right which he throw open
a blaze of yellow light stream out upon us and in the centre of the glare there stand a small man with a very high head a bristle of red hair all round the fringe of it and a bald shin scalp which shoot out from among it like a mountain peak from fir tree
he writhe his hand together as he stand and his feature be in a perpetual jerk now smile now scowl but never for an instant in repose
nature have give him a pendulous lip and a too visible line of yellow and irregular teeth which he strive feebly to conceal by constantly pass his hand over the lower part of his face
in spite of his obtrusive baldness he give the impression of youth
in point of fact he have just turn his thirtieth year
your servant miss morstan he keep repeat in a thin high voice
your servant gentlemen
pray step into my little sanctum
a small place miss but furnish to my own like
an oasis of art in the howl desert of south london
we be all astonish by the appearance of the apartment into which he invite us
in that sorry house it look as out of place as a diamond of the first water in a set of brass
the richest and glossiest of curtain and tapestries drape the wall loop back here and there to expose some richly mount paint or oriental vase
the carpet be of amber and black so soft and so thick that the foot sink pleasantly into it as into a bed of moss
two great tiger skin throw athwart it increase the suggestion of eastern luxury as do a huge hookah which stand upon a mat in the corner
a lamp in the fashion of a silver dive be hang from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre of the room
as it burn it fill the air with a subtle and aromatic odor
mr
thaddeus sholto say the little man still jerk and smile
that be my name
you be miss morstan of course
and these gentlemen this be mr
sherlock holmes and this be dr
watson
a doctor eh
cry he much excite
have you your stethoscope
might i ask you would you have the kindness
i have grave doubt as to my mitral valve if you would be so very good
the aortic i may rely upon but i should value your opinion upon the mitral
i listen to his heart as request but be unable to find anything amiss save indeed that he be in an ecstasy of fear for he shiver from head to foot
it appear to be normal i say
you have no cause for uneasiness
you will excuse my anxiety miss morstan he remark airily
i be a great sufferer and i have long have suspicions as to that valve
i be delight to hear that they be unwarranted
have your father miss morstan refrain from throw a strain upon his heart he might have be alive now
i could have strike the man across the face so hot be i at this callous and off hand reference to so delicate a matter
miss morstan sit down and her face grow white to the lips
i know in my heart that he be dead say she
i can give you every information say he and what be more i can do you justice and i will too whatever brother bartholomew may say
i be so glad to have your friends here not only as an escort to you but also as witness to what i be about to do and say
the three of us can show a bold front to brother bartholomew
but let us have no outsiders no police or officials
we can settle everything satisfactorily among ourselves without any interference
nothing would annoy brother bartholomew more than any publicity
he sit down upon a low settee and blink at us inquiringly with his weak watery blue eye
for my part say holmes whatever you may choose to say will go no further
i nod to show my agreement
that be well
that be well
say he
may i offer you a glass of chianti miss morstan
or of tokay
i keep no other win
shall i open a flask
no
well then i trust that you have no objection to tobacco smoke to the mild balsamic odor of the eastern tobacco
i be a little nervous and i find my hookah an invaluable sedative
he apply a taper to the great bowl and the smoke bubble merrily through the rise water
we sit all three in a semicircle with our head advance and our chin upon our hand while the strange jerky little fellow with his high shin head puff uneasily in the centre
when i first determine to make this communication to you say he i might have give you my address but i fear that you might disregard my request and bring unpleasant people with you
i take the liberty therefore of make an appointment in such a way that my man williams might be able to see you first
i have complete confidence in his discretion and he have order if he be dissatisfy to proceed no further in the matter
you will excuse these precautions but i be a man of somewhat retire and i might even say refine taste and there be nothing more unaesthetic than a policeman
i have a natural shrink from all form of rough materialism
i seldom come in contact with the rough crowd
i live as you see with some little atmosphere of elegance around me
i may call myself a patron of the arts
it be my weakness
the landscape be a genuine corot and though a connoisseur might perhaps throw a doubt upon that salvator rosa there cannot be the least question about the bouguereau
i be partial to the modern french school
you will excuse me mr
sholto say miss morstan but i be here at your request to learn something which you desire to tell me
it be very late and i should desire the interview to be as short as possible
at the best it must take some time he answer for we shall certainly have to go to norwood and see brother bartholomew
we shall all go and try if we can get the better of brother bartholomew
he be very angry with me for take the course which have seem right to me
i have quite high word with him last night
you cannot imagine what a terrible fellow he be when he be angry
if we be to go to norwood it would perhaps be as well to start at once i venture to remark
he laugh until his ears be quite red
that would hardly do he cry
i don't know what he would say if i bring you in that sudden way
no i must prepare you by show you how we all stand to each other
in the first place i must tell you that there be several point in the story of which i be myself ignorant
i can only lay the facts before you as far as i know them myself
my father be as you may have guess major john sholto once of the indian army
he retire some eleven years ago and come to live at pondicherry lodge in upper norwood
he have prosper in india and bring back with him a considerable sum of money a large collection of valuable curiosities and a staff of native servants
with these advantage he buy himself a house and live in great luxury
my twin brother bartholomew and i be the only children
i very well remember the sensation which be cause by the disappearance of captain morstan
we read the detail in the paper and know that he have be a friend of our father's we discuss the case freely in his presence
he use to join in our speculations as to what could have happen
never for an instant do we suspect that he have the whole secret hide in his own breast that of all men he alone know the fate of arthur morstan
we do know however that some mystery some positive danger overhang our father
he be very fearful of go out alone and he always employ two prize fighters to act as porter at pondicherry lodge
williams who drive you to night be one of them
he be once light weight champion of england
our father would never tell us what it be he fear but he have a most mark aversion to men with wooden legs
on one occasion he actually fire his revolver at a wooden legged man who prove to be a harmless tradesman canvass for order
we have to pay a large sum to hush the matter up
my brother and i use to think this a mere whim of my father's but events have since lead us to change our opinion
early in my father receive a letter from india which be a great shock to him
he nearly faint at the breakfast table when he open it and from that day he sicken to his death
what be in the letter we could never discover but i could see as he hold it that it be short and write in a scrawl hand
he have suffer for years from an enlarge spleen but he now become rapidly worse and towards the end of april we be inform that he be beyond all hope and that he wish to make a last communication to us
when we enter his room he be prop up with pillow and breathe heavily
he beseech us to lock the door and to come upon either side of the bed
then grasp our hand he make a remarkable statement to us in a voice which be break as much by emotion as by pain
i shall try and give it to you in his own very word
'i have only one thing ' he say 'which weigh upon my mind at this supreme moment
it be my treatment of poor morstan's orphan
the curse greed which have be my beset sin through life have withhold from her the treasure half at least of which should have be hers
and yet i have make no use of it myself so blind and foolish a thing be avarice
the mere feel of possession have be so dear to me that i could not bear to share it with another
see that chaplet dip with pearl beside the quinine bottle
even that i could not bear to part with although i have get it out with the design of send it to her
you my sons will give her a fair share of the agra treasure
but send her nothing not even the chaplet until i be go
after all men have be as bad as this and have recover
'i will tell you how morstan die ' he continue
'he have suffer for years from a weak heart but he conceal it from every one
i alone know it
when in india he and i through a remarkable chain of circumstances come into possession of a considerable treasure
i bring it over to england and on the night of morstan's arrival he come straight over here to claim his share
he walk over from the station and be admit by my faithful lal chowdar who be now dead
morstan and i have a difference of opinion as to the division of the treasure and we come to heat word
morstan have spring out of his chair in a paroxysm of anger when he suddenly press his hand to his side his face turn a dusky hue and he fell backwards cut his head against the corner of the treasure chest
when i stoop over him i find to my horror that he be dead
'for a long time i sit half distract wonder what i should do
my first impulse be of course to call for assistance but i could not but recognize that there be every chance that i would be accuse of his murder
his death at the moment of a quarrel and the gash in his head would be black against me
again an official inquiry could not be make without bring out some facts about the treasure which i be particularly anxious to keep secret
he have tell me that no soul upon earth know where he have go
there seem to be no necessity why any soul ever should know
'i be still ponder over the matter when look up i saw my servant lal chowdar in the doorway
he steal in and bolt the door behind him
do not fear sahib he say
no one need know that you have kill him
let us hide him away and who be the wiser
i do not kill him say i lal chowdar shake his head and smile
i hear it all sahib say he
i hear you quarrel and i hear the blow
but my lips be seal
all be asleep in the house
let us put him away together
that be enough to decide me
if my own servant could not believe my innocence how could i hope to make it good before twelve foolish tradesmen in a jury box
lal chowdar and i dispose of the body that night and within a few days the london paper be full of the mysterious disappearance of captain morstan
you will see from what i say that i can hardly be blame in the matter
my fault lie in the fact that we conceal not only the body but also the treasure and that i have cling to morstan's share as well as to my own
i wish you therefore to make restitution
put your ears down to my mouth
the treasure be hide in ' at this instant a horrible change come over his expression his eye star wildly his jaw drop and he yell in a voice which i can never forget 'keep him out
for christ's sake keep him out '
we both star round at the window behind us upon which his gaze be fix
a face be look in at us out of the darkness
we could see the whiten of the nose where it be press against the glass
it be a beard hairy face with wild cruel eye and an expression of concentrate malevolence
my brother and i rush towards the window but the man be go
when we return to my father his head have drop and his pulse have cease to beat
we search the garden that night but find no sign of the intruder save that just under the window a single footmark be visible in the flower bed
but for that one trace we might have think that our imaginations have conjure up that wild fierce face
we soon however have another and a more strike proof that there be secret agencies at work all round us
the window of my father's room be find open in the morning his cupboards and box have be rifle and upon his chest be fix a tear piece of paper with the word 'the sign of the four' scrawl across it
what the phrase mean or who our secret visitor may have be we never know
as far as we can judge none of my father's property have be actually steal though everything have be turn out
my brother and i naturally associate this peculiar incident with the fear which haunt my father during his life but it be still a complete mystery to us
the little man stop to relight his hookah and puff thoughtfully for a few moments
we have all sit absorb listen to his extraordinary narrative
at the short account of her father's death miss morstan have turn deadly white and for a moment i fear that she be about to faint
she rally however on drink a glass of water which i quietly pour out for her from a venetian carafe upon the side table
sherlock holmes lean back in his chair with an abstract expression and the lids draw low over his glitter eye
as i glance at him i could not but think how on that very day he have complain bitterly of the commonplaceness of life
here at least be a problem which would tax his sagacity to the utmost
mr
thaddeus sholto look from one to the other of us with an obvious pride at the effect which his story have produce and then continue between the puff of his overgrow pipe
my brother and i say he be as you may imagine much excite as to the treasure which my father have speak of
for weeks and for months we dig and delve in every part of the garden without discover its whereabouts
it be madden to think that the hide place be on his very lips at the moment that he die
we could judge the splendor of the miss riches by the chaplet which he have take out
over this chaplet my brother bartholomew and i have some little discussion
the pearl be evidently of great value and he be averse to part with them for between friends my brother be himself a little incline to my father's fault
he think too that if we part with the chaplet it might give rise to gossip and finally bring us into trouble
it be all that i could do to persuade him to let me find out miss morstan's address and send her a detach pearl at fix intervals so that at least she might never feel destitute
it be a kindly think say our companion earnestly
it be extremely good of you
the little man wave his hand deprecatingly
we be your trustees he say
that be the view which i take of it though brother bartholomew could not altogether see it in that light
we have plenty of money ourselves
i desire no more
besides it would have be such bad taste to have treat a young lady in so scurvy a fashion
'le mauvais gout mene au crime '
the french have a very neat way of put these things
our difference of opinion on this subject go so far that i think it best to set up room for myself so i leave pondicherry lodge take the old khitmutgar and williams with me
yesterday however i learn that an event of extreme importance have occur
the treasure have be discover
i instantly communicate with miss morstan and it only remain for us to drive out to norwood and demand our share
i explain my view last night to brother bartholomew so we shall be expect if not welcome visitors
mr
thaddeus sholto cease and sit twitch on his luxurious settee
we all remain silent with our thoughts upon the new development which the mysterious business have take
holmes be the first to spring to his feet
you have do well sir from first to last say he
it be possible that we may be able to make you some small return by throw some light upon that which be still dark to you
but as miss morstan remark just now it be late and we have best put the matter through without delay
our new acquaintance very deliberately coil up the tube of his hookah and produce from behind a curtain a very long befrogged topcoat with astrakhan collar and cuff
this he button tightly up in spite of the extreme closeness of the night and finish his attire by put on a rabbit skin cap with hang lappets which cover the ears so that no part of him be visible save his mobile and peaky face
my health be somewhat fragile he remark as he lead the way down the passage
i be compel to be a valetudinarian
our cab be await us outside and our programme be evidently prearrange for the driver start off at once at a rapid pace
thaddeus sholto talk incessantly in a voice which rise high above the rattle of the wheel
bartholomew be a clever fellow say he
how do you think he find out where the treasure be
he have come to the conclusion that it be somewhere indoors so he work out all the cubic space of the house and make measurements everywhere so that not one inch should be unaccounted for
among other things he find that the height of the build be seventy four feet but on add together the heights of all the separate room and make every allowance for the space between which he ascertain by bore he could not bring the total to more than seventy feet
there be four feet unaccounted for
these could only be at the top of the build
he knock a hole therefore in the lath and plaster ceiling of the highest room and there sure enough he come upon another little garret above it which have be seal up and be know to no one
in the centre stand the treasure chest rest upon two rafter
he lower it through the hole and there it lie
he compute the value of the jewel at not less than half a million sterling
at the mention of this gigantic sum we all star at one another open eye
miss morstan could we secure her right would change from a needy govern to the richest heiress in england
surely it be the place of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news yet i be ashamed to say that selfishness take me by the soul and that my heart turn as heavy as lead within me
i stammer out some few halt word of congratulation and then sit downcast with my head droop deaf to the babble of our new acquaintance
he be clearly a confirm hypochondriac and i be dreamily conscious that he be pour forth interminable train of symptoms and implore information as to the composition and action of innumerable quack nostrums some of which he bore about in a leather case in his pocket
i trust that he may not remember any of the answer which i give him that night
holmes declare that he overhear me caution him against the great danger of take more than two drop of castor oil while i recommend strychnine in large dose as a sedative
however that may be i be certainly relieve when our cab pull up with a jerk and the coachman spring down to open the door
this miss morstan be pondicherry lodge say mr
thaddeus sholto as he hand her out
it be nearly eleven o'clock when we reach this final stage of our night's adventure
we have leave the damp fog of the great city behind us and the night be fairly fine
a warm wind blow from the westward and heavy cloud move slowly across the sky with half a moon peep occasionally through the rifts
it be clear enough to see for some distance but thaddeus sholto take down one of the side lamps from the carriage to give us a better light upon our way
pondicherry lodge stand in its own ground and be gird round with a very high stone wall top with break glass
a single narrow iron clamp door form the only mean of entrance
on this our guide knock with a peculiar postman like rat tat
who be there
cry a gruff voice from within
it be i mcmurdo
you surely know my knock by this time
there be a grumble sound and a clank and jar of key
the door swing heavily back and a short deep chested man stand in the open with the yellow light of the lantern shin upon his protrude face and twinkle distrustful eye
that you mr
thaddeus
but who be the others
i have no order about them from the master
no mcmurdo
you surprise me
i tell my brother last night that i should bring some friends
he ain't be out o' his room to day mr
thaddeus and i have no order
you know very well that i must stick to regulations
i can let you in but your friends must just stop where they be
this be an unexpected obstacle
thaddeus sholto look about him in a perplex and helpless manner
this be too bad of you mcmurdo
he say
if i guarantee them that be enough for you
there be the young lady too
she cannot wait on the public road at this hour
very sorry mr
thaddeus say the porter inexorably
folk may be friends o' yours and yet no friends o' the master's
he pay me well to do my duty and my duty i'll do
i don't know none o' your friends
oh yes you do mcmurdo cry sherlock holmes genially
i don't think you can have forget me
don't you remember the amateur who fight three round with you at alison's room on the night of your benefit four years back
not mr
sherlock holmes
roar the prize fighter
god's truth
how could i have mistake you
if instead o' standin' there so quiet you have just step up and give me that cross hit of yours under the jaw i'd ha' know you without a question
ah you're one that have waste your gift you have
you might have aim high if you have join the fancy
you see watson if all else fail me i have still one of the scientific professions open to me say holmes laugh
our friend won't keep us out in the cold now i be sure
in you come sir in you come you and your friends he answer
very sorry mr
thaddeus but order be very strict
have to be certain of your friends before i let them in
inside a gravel path wind through desolate ground to a huge clump of a house square and prosaic all plunge in shadow save where a moonbeam strike one corner and glimmer in a garret window
the vast size of the build with its gloom and its deathly silence strike a chill to the heart
even thaddeus sholto seem ill at ease and the lantern quiver and rattle in his hand
i cannot understand it he say
there must be some mistake
i distinctly tell bartholomew that we should be here and yet there be no light in his window
i do not know what to make of it
do he always guard the premise in this way
ask holmes
yes he have follow my father's custom
he be the favorite son you know and i sometimes think that my father may have tell him more than he ever tell me
that be bartholomew's window up there where the moonshine strike
it be quite bright but there be no light from within i think
none say holmes
but i see the glint of a light in that little window beside the door
ah that be the housekeeper's room
that be where old mrs
bernstone sit
she can tell us all about it
but perhaps you would not mind wait here for a minute or two for if we all go in together and she have no word of our come she may be alarm
but hush
what be that
he hold up the lantern and his hand shake until the circle of light flicker and waver all round us
miss morstan seize my wrist and we all stand with thump hearts strain our ears
from the great black house there sound through the silent night the saddest and most pitiful of sound the shrill break whimper of a frighten woman
it be mrs
bernstone say sholto
she be the only woman in the house
wait here
i shall be back in a moment
he hurry for the door and knock in his peculiar way
we could see a tall old woman admit him and sway with pleasure at the very sight of him
oh mr
thaddeus sir i be so glad you have come
i be so glad you have come mr
thaddeus sir
we hear her reiterate rejoice until the door be close and her voice die away into a muffle monotone
our guide have leave us the lantern
holmes swing it slowly round and peer keenly at the house and at the great rubbish heap which cumber the ground
miss morstan and i stand together and her hand be in mine
a wondrous subtle thing be love for here be we two who have never see each other before that day between whom no word or even look of affection have ever pass and yet now in an hour of trouble our hand instinctively seek for each other
i have marvel at it since but at the time it seem the most natural thing that i should go out to her so and as she have often tell me there be in her also the instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection
so we stand hand in hand like two children and there be peace in our hearts for all the dark things that surround us
what a strange place
she say look round
it look as though all the moles in england have be let loose in it
i have see something of the sort on the side of a hill near ballarat where the prospectors have be at work
and from the same cause say holmes
these be the trace of the treasure seekers
you must remember that they be six years look for it
no wonder that the ground look like a gravel pit
at that moment the door of the house burst open and thaddeus sholto come run out with his hand throw forward and terror in his eye
there be something amiss with bartholomew
he cry
i be frighten
my nerve cannot stand it
he be indeed half blubber with fear and his twitch feeble face peep out from the great astrakhan collar have the helpless appeal expression of a terrify child
come into the house say holmes in his crisp firm way
yes do
plead thaddeus sholto
i really do not feel equal to give directions
we all follow him into the housekeeper's room which stand upon the leave hand side of the passage
the old woman be pace up and down with a scar look and restless pick finger but the sight of miss morstan appear to have a soothe effect upon her
god bless your sweet calm face
she cry with an hysterical sob
it do me good to see you
oh but i have be sorely try this day
our companion pat her thin work wear hand and murmur some few word of kindly womanly comfort which bring the color back into the others bloodless cheek
master have lock himself in and will not answer me she explain
all day i have wait to hear from him for he often like to be alone but an hour ago i fear that something be amiss so i go up and peep through the key hole
you must go up mr
thaddeus you must go up and look for yourself
i have see mr
bartholomew sholto in joy and in sorrow for ten long years but i never saw him with such a face on him as that
sherlock holmes take the lamp and lead the way for thaddeus sholto's teeth be chatter in his head
so shake be he that i have to pass my hand under his arm as we go up the stairs for his knees be tremble under him
twice as we ascend holmes whip his lens out of his pocket and carefully examine mark which appear to me to be mere shapeless smudge of dust upon the cocoa nut mat which serve as a stair carpet
he walk slowly from step to step hold the lamp and shoot keen glance to right and leave
miss morstan have remain behind with the frighten housekeeper
the third flight of stairs end in a straight passage of some length with a great picture in indian tapestry upon the right of it and three doors upon the leave
holmes advance along it in the same slow and methodical way while we keep close at his heel with our long black shadow stream backwards down the corridor
the third door be that which we be seek
holmes knock without receive any answer and then try to turn the handle and force it open
it be lock on the inside however and by a broad and powerful bolt as we could see when we set our lamp up against it
the key be turn however the hole be not entirely close
sherlock holmes bend down to it and instantly rise again with a sharp intaking of the breath
there be something devilish in this watson say he more move than i have ever before see him
what do you make of it
i stoop to the hole and recoil in horror
moonlight be stream into the room and it be bright with a vague and shifty radiance
look straight at me and suspend as it be in the air for all beneath be in shadow there hang a face the very face of our companion thaddeus
there be the same high shin head the same circular bristle of red hair the same bloodless countenance
the feature be set however in a horrible smile a fix and unnatural grin which in that still and moonlit room be more jar to the nerve than any scowl or contortion
so like be the face to that of our little friend that i look round at him to make sure that he be indeed with us
then i recall to mind that he have mention to us that his brother and he be twin
this be terrible
i say to holmes
what be to be do
the door must come down he answer and spring against it he put all his weight upon the lock
it creak and groan but do not yield
together we fling ourselves upon it once more and this time it give way with a sudden snap and we find ourselves within bartholomew sholto's chamber
it appear to have be fit up as a chemical laboratory
a double line of glass stopper bottle be draw up upon the wall opposite the door and the table be litter over with bunsen burners test tube and retort
in the corner stand carboys of acid in wicker baskets
one of these appear to leak or to have be break for a stream of dark color liquid have trickle out from it and the air be heavy with a peculiarly pungent tar like odor
a set of step stand at one side of the room in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster and above them there be an open in the ceiling large enough for a man to pass through
at the foot of the step a long coil of rope be throw carelessly together
by the table in a wooden arm chair the master of the house be seat all in a heap with his head sink upon his leave shoulder and that ghastly inscrutable smile upon his face
he be stiff and cold and have clearly be dead many hours
it seem to me that not only his feature but all his limbs be twist and turn in the most fantastic fashion
by his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar instrument a brown close grain stick with a stone head like a hammer rudely lash on with coarse twine
beside it be a tear sheet of note paper with some word scrawl upon it
holmes glance at it and then hand it to me
you see he say with a significant raise of the eyebrows
in the light of the lantern i read with a thrill of horror the sign of the four
in god's name what do it all mean
i ask
it mean murder say he stoop over the dead man
ah i expect it
look here
he point to what look like a long dark thorn stick in the skin just above the ear
it look like a thorn say i
it be a thorn
you may pick it out
but be careful for it be poison
i take it up between my finger and thumb
it come away from the skin so readily that hardly any mark be leave behind
one tiny speck of blood show where the puncture have be
this be all an insoluble mystery to me say i
it grow darker instead of clearer
on the contrary he answer it clear every instant
i only require a few miss link to have an entirely connect case
we have almost forget our companion's presence since we enter the chamber
he be still stand in the door way the very picture of terror wring his hand and moan to himself
suddenly however he break out into a sharp querulous cry
the treasure be go
he say
they have rob him of the treasure
there be the hole through which we lower it
i help him to do it
i be the last person who saw him
i leave him here last night and i hear him lock the door as i come down stairs
what time be that
it be ten o'clock
and now he be dead and the police will be call in and i shall be suspect of have have a hand in it
oh yes i be sure i shall
but you don't think so gentlemen
surely you don't think that it be i
be it likely that i would have bring you here if it be i
oh dear
oh dear
i know that i shall go mad
he jerk his arm and stamp his feet in a kind of convulsive frenzy
you have no reason for fear mr
sholto say holmes kindly put his hand upon his shoulder
take my advice and drive down to the station to report this matter to the police
offer to assist them in every way
we shall wait here until your return
the little man obey in a half stupefy fashion and we hear him stumble down the stairs in the dark
now watson say holmes rub his hand we have half an hour to ourselves
let us make good use of it
my case be as i have tell you almost complete but we must not err on the side of over confidence
simple as the case seem now there may be something deeper underlie it
simple
i ejaculate
surely say he with something of the air of a clinical professor expound to his class
just sit in the corner there that your footprints may not complicate matter
now to work
in the first place how do these folk come and how do they go
the door have not be open since last night
how of the window
he carry the lamp across to it mutter his observations aloud the while but address them to himself rather than to me
window be snibbed on the inner side
framework be solid
no hinge at the side
let us open it
no water pipe near
roof quite out of reach
yet a man have mount by the window
it rain a little last night
here be the print of a foot in mould upon the sill
and here be a circular muddy mark and here again upon the floor and here again by the table
see here watson
this be really a very pretty demonstration
i look at the round well define muddy discs
this be not a footmark say i
it be something much more valuable to us
it be the impression of a wooden stump
you see here on the sill be the boot mark a heavy boot with the broad metal heel and beside it be the mark of the timber toe
it be the wooden legged man
quite so
but there have be some one else a very able and efficient ally
could you scale that wall doctor
i look out of the open window
the moon still shine brightly on that angle of the house
we be a good sixty feet from the grind and look where i would i could see no foothold nor as much as a crevice in the brick work
it be absolutely impossible i answer
without aid it be so
but suppose you have a friend up here who lower you this good stout rope which i see in the corner secure one end of it to this great hook in the wall
then i think if you be an active man you might swarm up wooden leg and all
you would depart of course in the same fashion and your ally would draw up the rope untie it from the hook shut the window snib it on the inside and get away in the way that he originally come
as a minor point it may be note he continue finger the rope that our wooden legged friend though a fair climber be not a professional sailor
his hand be far from horny
my lens disclose more than one blood mark especially towards the end of the rope from which i gather that he slip down with such velocity that he take the skin off his hand
this be all very well say i but the thing become more unintelligible than ever
how about this mysterious ally
how come he into the room
yes the ally
repeat holmes pensively
there be feature of interest about this ally
he lift the case from the regions of the commonplace
i fancy that this ally break fresh grind in the annals of crime in this country though parallel case suggest themselves from india and if my memory serve me from senegambia
how come he then
i reiterate
the door be lock the window be inaccessible
be it through the chimney
the grate be much too small he answer
i have already consider that possibility
how then
i persist
you will not apply my precept he say shake his head
how often have i say to you that when you have eliminate the impossible whatever remain however improbable must be the truth
we know that he do not come through the door the window or the chimney
we also know that he could not have be conceal in the room as there be no concealment possible
whence then do he come
he come through the hole in the roof i cry
of course he do
he must have do so
if you will have the kindness to hold the lamp for me we shall now extend our research to the room above the secret room in which the treasure be find
he mount the step and seize a rafter with either hand he swing himself up into the garret
then lie on his face he reach down for the lamp and hold it while i follow him
the chamber in which we find ourselves be about ten feet one way and six the other
the floor be form by the rafter with thin lath and plaster between so that in walk one have to step from beam to beam
the roof run up to an apex and be evidently the inner shell of the true roof of the house
there be no furniture of any sort and the accumulate dust of years lay thick upon the floor
here you be you see say sherlock holmes put his hand against the slop wall
this be a trap door which lead out on to the roof
i can press it back and here be the roof itself slop at a gentle angle
this then be the way by which number one enter
let us see if we can find any other trace of his individuality
he hold down the lamp to the floor and as he do so i saw for the second time that night a startle surprise look come over his face
for myself as i follow his gaze my skin be cold under my clothe
the floor be cover thickly with the print of a naked foot clear well define perfectly form but scarce half the size of those of an ordinary man
holmes i say in a whisper a child have do the horrid thing
he have recover his self possession in an instant
i be stagger for the moment he say but the thing be quite natural
my memory fail me or i should have be able to foretell it
there be nothing more to be learn here
let us go down
what be your theory then as to those footmarks
i ask eagerly when we have regain the lower room once more
my dear watson try a little analysis yourself say he with a touch of impatience
you know my methods
apply them and it will be instructive to compare result
i cannot conceive anything which will cover the facts i answer
it will be clear enough to you soon he say in an off hand way
i think that there be nothing else of importance here but i will look
he whip out his lens and a tape measure and hurry about the room on his knees measure compare examine with his long thin nose only a few inch from the plank and his beady eye gleam and deep set like those of a bird
so swift silent and furtive be his movements like those of a train blood hound pick out a scent that i could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have make have he turn his energy and sagacity against the law instead of exert them in its defense
as he hunt about he keep mutter to himself and finally he break out into a loud crow of delight
we be certainly in luck say he
we ought to have very little trouble now
number one have have the misfortune to tread in the creosote
you can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here at the side of this evil smell mess
the carboy have be crack you see and the stuff have leak out
what then
i ask
why we have get him that's all say he
i know a dog that would follow that scent to the world's end
if a pack can track a trail herring across a shire how far can a specially train hound follow so pungent a smell as this
it sound like a sum in the rule of three
the answer should give us the but halloo
here be the accredit representatives of the law
heavy step and the clamor of loud voice be audible from below and the hall door shut with a loud crash
before they come say holmes just put your hand here on this poor fellow's arm and here on his leg
what do you feel
the muscle be as hard as a board i answer
quite so
they be in a state of extreme contraction far exceed the usual rigor mortis
couple with this distortion of the face this hippocratic smile or 'risus sardonicus ' as the old writers call it what conclusion would it suggest to your mind
death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid i answer some strychnine like substance which would produce tetanus
that be the idea which occur to me the instant i saw the draw muscle of the face
on get into the room i at once look for the mean by which the poison have enter the system
as you saw i discover a thorn which have be drive or shoot with no great force into the scalp
you observe that the part strike be that which would be turn towards the hole in the ceiling if the man be erect in his chair
now examine the thorn
i take it up gingerly and hold it in the light of the lantern
it be long sharp and black with a glaze look near the point as though some gummy substance have dry upon it
the blunt end have be trim and round off with a knife
be that an english thorn
he ask
no it certainly be not
with all these data you should be able to draw some just inference
but here be the regulars so the auxiliary force may beat a retreat
as he speak the step which have be come nearer sound loudly on the passage and a very stout portly man in a gray suit stride heavily into the room
he be red face burly and plethoric with a pair of very small twinkle eye which look keenly out from between swell and puffy pouch
he be closely follow by an inspector in uniform and by the still palpitate thaddeus sholto
here's a business
he cry in a muffle husky voice
here's a pretty business
but who be all these
why the house seem to be as full as a rabbit warren
i think you must recollect me mr
athelney jones say holmes quietly
why of course i do
he wheeze
it's mr
sherlock holmes the theorist
remember you
i'll never forget how you lecture us all on cause and inferences and effect in the bishopgate jewel case
it's true you set us on the right track but you'll own now that it be more by good luck than good guidance
it be a piece of very simple reason
oh come now come
never be ashamed to own up
but what be all this
bad business
bad business
stern facts here no room for theories
how lucky that i happen to be out at norwood over another case
i be at the station when the message arrive
what d'you think the man die of
oh this be hardly a case for me to theorize over say holmes dryly
no no
still we can't deny that you hit the nail on the head sometimes
dear me
door lock i understand
jewel worth half a million miss
how be the window
fasten but there be step on the sill
well well if it be fasten the step could have nothing to do with the matter
that's common sense
man might have die in a fit but then the jewel be miss
ha
i have a theory
these flash come upon me at time just step outside sergeant and you mr
sholto
your friend can remain what do you think of this holmes
sholto be on his own confession with his brother last night
the brother die in a fit on which sholto walk off with the treasure
how's that
on which the dead man very considerately get up and lock the door on the inside
hum
there's a flaw there
let us apply common sense to the matter
this thaddeus sholto be with his brother there be a quarrel so much we know
the brother be dead and the jewel be go
so much also we know
no one saw the brother from the time thaddeus leave him
his bed have not be sleep in
thaddeus be evidently in a most disturb state of mind
his appearance be well not attractive
you see that i be weave my web round thaddeus
the net begin to close upon him
you be not quite in possession of the facts yet say holmes
this splinter of wood which i have every reason to believe to be poison be in the man's scalp where you still see the mark this card inscribe as you see it be on the table and beside it lay this rather curious stone head instrument
how do all that fit into your theory
confirm it in every respect say the fat detective pompously
house be full of indian curiosities
thaddeus bring this up and if this splinter be poisonous thaddeus may as well have make murderous use of it as any other man
the card be some hocus pocus a blind as like as not
the only question be how do he depart
ah of course here be a hole in the roof
with great activity consider his bulk he spring up the step and squeeze through into the garret and immediately afterwards we hear his exult voice proclaim that he have find the trap door
he can find something remark holmes shrug his shoulder
he have occasional glimmer of reason
_il n'y a pas des sots si incommode que ceux qui ont de l'esprit _ you see
say athelney jones reappear down the step again
facts be better than mere theories after all
my view of the case be confirm
there be a trap door communicate with the roof and it be partly open
it be i who open it
oh indeed
you do notice it then
he seem a little crestfallen at the discovery
well whoever notice it it show how our gentleman get away
inspector
yes sir from the passage
ask mr
sholto to step this way mr
sholto it be my duty to inform you that anything which you may say will be use against you
i arrest you in the queen's name as be concern in the death of your brother
there now
didn't i tell you
cry the poor little man throw out his hand and look from one to the other of us
don't trouble yourself about it mr
sholto say holmes
i think that i can engage to clear you of the charge
don't promise too much mr
theorist don't promise too much
snap the detective
you may find it a harder matter than you think
not only will i clear him mr
jones but i will make you a free present of the name and description of one of the two people who be in this room last night
his name i have every reason to believe be jonathan small
he be a poorly educate man small active with his right leg off and wear a wooden stump which be wear away upon the inner side
his leave boot have a coarse square toe sole with an iron band round the heel
he be a middle age man much sunburn and have be a convict
these few indications may be of some assistance to you couple with the fact that there be a good deal of skin miss from the palm of his hand
the other man ah
the other man
ask athelney jones in a sneer voice but impress none the less as i could easily see by the precision of the other's manner
be a rather curious person say sherlock holmes turn upon his heel
i hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair of them a word with you watson
he lead me out to the head of the stair
this unexpected occurrence he say have cause us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of our journey
i have just be think so i answer
it be not right that miss morstan should remain in this stricken house
no
you must escort her home
she live with mrs
cecil forrester in lower camberwell so it be not very far
i will wait for you here if you will drive out again
or perhaps you be too tire
by no mean
i don't think i could rest until i know more of this fantastic business
i have see something of the rough side of life but i give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprise to night have shake my nerve completely
i should like however to see the matter through with you now that i have get so far
your presence will be of great service to me he answer
we shall work the case out independently and leave this fellow jones to exult over any mare's nest which he may choose to construct
when you have drop miss morstan i wish you to go on to no
pinchin lane down near the water's edge at lambeth
the third house on the right hand side be a bird stuffer's sherman be the name
you will see a weasel hold a young rabbit in the window
knock old sherman up and tell him with my compliment that i want toby at once
you will bring toby back in the cab with you
a dog i suppose
yes a queer mongrel with a most amaze power of scent
i would rather have toby's help than that of the whole detective force of london
i shall bring him then say i
it be one now
i ought to be back before three if i can get a fresh horse
and i say holmes shall see what i can learn from mrs
bernstone and from the indian servant who mr
thaddeus tell me sleep in the next garret
then i shall study the great jones's methods and listen to his not too delicate sarcasms
'wir sind gewohnt das die menschen verhoehnen be sie nicht verstehen '
goethe be always pithy
the police have bring a cab with them and in this i escort miss morstan back to her home
after the angelic fashion of women she have bear trouble with a calm face as long as there be some one weaker than herself to support and i have find her bright and placid by the side of the frighten housekeeper
in the cab however she first turn faint and then burst into a passion of weep so sorely have she be try by the adventure of the night
she have tell me since that she think me cold and distant upon that journey
she little guess the struggle within my breast or the effort of self restraint which hold me back
my sympathies and my love go out to her even as my hand have in the garden
i felt that years of the conventionalities of life could not teach me to know her sweet brave nature as have this one day of strange experience
yet there be two thoughts which seal the word of affection upon my lips
she be weak and helpless shake in mind and nerve
it be to take her at a disadvantage to obtrude love upon her at such a time
worse still she be rich
if holmes's research be successful she would be an heiress
be it fair be it honorable that a half pay surgeon should take such advantage of an intimacy which chance have bring about
might she not look upon me as a mere vulgar fortune seeker
i could not bear to risk that such a think should cross her mind
this agra treasure intervene like an impassable barrier between us
it be nearly two o'clock when we reach mrs
cecil forrester's
the servants have retire hours ago but mrs
forrester have be so interest by the strange message which miss morstan have receive that she have sit up in the hope of her return
she open the door herself a middle age graceful woman and it give me joy to see how tenderly her arm steal round the other's waist and how motherly be the voice in which she greet her
she be clearly no mere pay dependant but an honor friend
i be introduce and mrs
forrester earnestly beg me to step in and tell her our adventure
i explain however the importance of my errand and promise faithfully to call and report any progress which we might make with the case
as we drive away i steal a glance back and i still seem to see that little group on the step the two graceful cling figure the half open door the hall light shin through stain glass the barometer and the bright stair rods
it be soothe to catch even that pass glimpse of a tranquil english home in the midst of the wild dark business which have absorb us
and the more i think of what have happen the wilder and darker it grow
i review the whole extraordinary sequence of events as i rattle on through the silent gas light streets
there be the original problem that at least be pretty clear now
the death of captain morstan the send of the pearl the advertisement the letter we have have light upon all those events
they have only lead us however to a deeper and far more tragic mystery
the indian treasure the curious plan find among morstan's baggage the strange scene at major sholto's death the rediscovery of the treasure immediately follow by the murder of the discoverer the very singular accompaniments to the crime the footsteps the remarkable weapons the word upon the card correspond with those upon captain morstan's chart here be indeed a labyrinth in which a man less singularly endow than my fellow lodger might well despair of ever find the clue
pinchin lane be a row of shabby two storied brick house in the lower quarter of lambeth
i have to knock for some time at no
before i could make my impression
at last however there be the glint of a candle behind the blind and a face look out at the upper window
go on you drunken vagabone say the face
if you kick up any more row i'll open the kennel and let out forty three dog upon you
if you'll let one out it's just what i have come for say i
go on
yell the voice
so help me gracious i have a wiper in the bag an' i'll drop it on your 'ead if you don't hook it
but i want a dog i cry
i won't be argue with
shout mr
sherman
now stand clear for when i say 'three ' down go the wiper
mr
sherlock holmes i begin but the word have a most magical effect for the window instantly slam down and within a minute the door be unbar and open
mr
sherman be a lanky lean old man with stoop shoulder a stringy neck and blue tint glass
a friend of mr
sherlock be always welcome say he
step in sir
keep clear of the badger for he bite
ah naughty naughty would you take a nip at the gentleman
this to a stoat which thrust its wicked head and red eye between the bar of its cage
don't mind that sir it's only a slow worm
it hain't get no fangs so i give it the run o' the room for it keep the beetle down
you must not mind my bein' just a little short wi' you at first for i'm guy at by the children and there's many a one just come down this lane to knock me up
what be it that mr
sherlock holmes want sir
he want a dog of yours
ah
that would be toby
yes toby be the name
toby live at no
on the leave here
he move slowly forward with his candle among the queer animal family which he have gather round him
in the uncertain shadowy light i could see dimly that there be glance glimmer eye peep down at us from every cranny and corner
even the rafter above our head be line by solemn fowl who lazily shift their weight from one leg to the other as our voice disturb their slumber
toby prove to be an ugly long haired lop eared creature half spaniel and half lurcher brown and white in color with a very clumsy waddle gait
it accept after some hesitation a lump of sugar which the old naturalist hand to me and have thus seal an alliance it follow me to the cab and make no difficulties about accompany me
it have just strike three on the palace clock when i find myself back once more at pondicherry lodge
the ex prize fighter mcmurdo have i find be arrest as an accessory and both he and mr
sholto have be march off to the station
two constables guard the narrow gate but they allow me to pass with the dog on my mention the detective's name
holmes be stand on the door step with his hand in his pocket smoke his pipe
ah you have him there
say he
good dog then
atheney jones have go
we have have an immense display of energy since you leave
he have arrest not only friend thaddeus but the gatekeeper the housekeeper and the indian servant
we have the place to ourselves but for a sergeant up stairs
leave the dog here and come up
we tie toby to the hall table and reascended the stairs
the room be as he have leave it save that a sheet have be drape over the central figure
a weary look police sergeant recline in the corner
lend me your bull's eye sergeant say my companion
now tie this bite of card round my neck so as to hang it in front of me
thank you
now i must kick off my boot and stock just you carry them down with you watson
i be go to do a little climb
and dip my handkerchief into the creasote
that will do
now come up into the garret with me for a moment
we clamber up through the hole
holmes turn his light once more upon the footsteps in the dust
i wish you particularly to notice these footmarks he say
do you observe anything noteworthy about them
they belong i say to a child or a small woman
apart from their size though
be there nothing else
they appear to be much as other footmarks
not at all
look here
this be the print of a right foot in the dust
now i make one with my naked foot beside it
what be the chief difference
your toe be all cramp together
the other print have each toe distinctly divide
quite so
that be the point
bear that in mind
now would you kindly step over to that flap window and smell the edge of the wood work
i shall stay here as i have this handkerchief in my hand
i do as he direct and be instantly conscious of a strong tarry smell
that be where he put his foot in get out
if you can trace him i should think that toby will have no difficulty
now run down stairs loose the dog and look out for blondin
by the time that i get out into the ground sherlock holmes be on the roof and i could see him like an enormous glow worm crawl very slowly along the ridge
i lose sight of him behind a stack of chimneys but he presently reappear and then vanish once more upon the opposite side
when i make my way round there i find him seat at one of the corner eaves
that you watson
he cry
yes
this be the place
what be that black thing down there
a water barrel
top on it
yes
no sign of a ladder
no
confound the fellow
it's a most break neck place
i ought to be able to come down where he could climb up
the water pipe feel pretty firm
here go anyhow
there be a scuffle of feet and the lantern begin to come steadily down the side of the wall
then with a light spring he come on to the barrel and from there to the earth
it be easy to follow him he say draw on his stock and boot
tile be loosen the whole way along and in his hurry he have drop this
it confirm my diagnosis as you doctor express it
the object which he hold up to me be a small pocket or pouch weave out of color grass and with a few tawdry bead string round it
in shape and size it be not unlike a cigarette case
inside be half a dozen spin of dark wood sharp at one end and round at the other like that which have strike bartholomew sholto
they be hellish things say he
look out that you don't prick yourself
i'm delight to have them for the chance be that they be all he have
there be the less fear of you or me find one in our skin before long
i would sooner face a martini bullet myself
be you game for a six mile trudge watson
certainly i answer
your leg will stand it
oh yes
here you be doggy
good old toby
smell it toby smell it
he push the creasote handkerchief under the dog's nose while the creature stand with its fluffy legs separate and with a most comical cock to its head like a connoisseur sniff the bouquet of a famous vintage
holmes then throw the handkerchief to a distance fasten a stout cord to the mongrel's collar and lead him to the foot of the water barrel
the creature instantly break into a succession of high tremulous yelp and with his nose on the grind and his tail in the air patter off upon the trail at a pace which strain his leash and keep us at the top of our speed
the east have be gradually whiten and we could now see some distance in the cold gray light
the square massive house with its black empty windows and high bare wall tower up sad and forlorn behind us
our course lead right across the ground in and out among the trench and pit with which they be scar and intersect
the whole place with its scatter dirt heap and ill grow shrubs have a blight ill omen look which harmonize with the black tragedy which hang over it
on reach the boundary wall toby run along whine eagerly underneath its shadow and stop finally in a corner screen by a young beech
where the two wall join several bricks have be loosen and the crevices leave be wear down and round upon the lower side as though they have frequently be use as a ladder
holmes clamber up and take the dog from me he drop it over upon the other side
there's the print of wooden leg's hand he remark as i mount up beside him
you see the slight smudge of blood upon the white plaster
what a lucky thing it be that we have have no very heavy rain since yesterday
the scent will lie upon the road in spite of their eight and twenty hours' start
i confess that i have my doubt myself when i reflect upon the great traffic which have pass along the london road in the interval
my fear be soon appease however
toby never hesitate or swerve but waddle on in his peculiar roll fashion
clearly the pungent smell of the creasote rise high above all other contend scent
do not imagine say holmes that i depend for my success in this case upon the mere chance of one of these fellows have put his foot in the chemical
i have knowledge now which would enable me to trace them in many different ways
this however be the readiest and since fortune have put it into our hand i should be culpable if i neglect it
it have however prevent the case from become the pretty little intellectual problem which it at one time promise to be
there might have be some credit to be gain out of it but for this too palpable clue
there be credit and to spare say i
i assure you holmes that i marvel at the mean by which you obtain your result in this case even more than i do in the jefferson hope murder
the thing seem to me to be deeper and more inexplicable
how for example could you describe with such confidence the wooden legged man
pshaw my dear boy
it be simplicity itself
i don't wish to be theatrical
it be all patent and above board
two officer who be in command of a convict guard learn an important secret as to bury treasure
a map be draw for them by an englishman name jonathan small
you remember that we saw the name upon the chart in captain morstan's possession
he have sign it in behalf of himself and his associate the sign of the four as he somewhat dramatically call it
aid by this chart the officer or one of them get the treasure and bring it to england leave we will suppose some condition under which he receive it unfulfilled
now then why do not jonathan small get the treasure himself
the answer be obvious
the chart be date at a time when morstan be bring into close association with convict
jonathan small do not get the treasure because he and his associate be themselves convict and could not get away
but that be mere speculation say i
it be more than that
it be the only hypothesis which cover the facts
let us see how it fit in with the sequel
major sholto remain at peace for some years happy in the possession of his treasure
then he receive a letter from india which give him a great fright
what be that
a letter to say that the men whom he have wrong have be set free
or have escape
that be much more likely for he would have know what their term of imprisonment be
it would not have be a surprise to him
what do he do then
he guard himself against a wooden legged man a white man mark you for he mistake a white tradesman for him and actually fire a pistol at him
now only one white man's name be on the chart
the others be hindoos or mohammedans
there be no other white man
therefore we may say with confidence that the wooden legged man be identical with jonathan small
do the reason strike you as be faulty
no it be clear and concise
well now let us put ourselves in the place of jonathan small
let us look at it from his point of view
he come to england with the double idea of regain what he would consider to be his right and of have his revenge upon the man who have wrong him
he find out where sholto live and very possibly he establish communications with some one inside the house
there be this butler lal rao whom we have not see
mrs
bernstone give him far from a good character
small could not find out however where the treasure be hide for no one ever know save the major and one faithful servant who have die
suddenly small learn that the major be on his death bed
in a frenzy lest the secret of the treasure die with him he run the gauntlet of the guard make his way to the die man's window and be only deter from enter by the presence of his two sons
mad with hate however against the dead man he enter the room that night search his private paper in the hope of discover some memorandum relate to the treasure and finally leave a momento of his visit in the short inscription upon the card
he have doubtless plan beforehand that should he slay the major he would leave some such record upon the body as a sign that it be not a common murder but from the point of view of the four associate something in the nature of an act of justice
whimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind be common enough in the annals of crime and usually afford valuable indications as to the criminal
do you follow all this
very clearly
now what could jonathan small do
he could only continue to keep a secret watch upon the efforts make to find the treasure
possibly he leave england and only come back at intervals
then come the discovery of the garret and he be instantly inform of it
we again trace the presence of some confederate in the household
jonathan with his wooden leg be utterly unable to reach the lofty room of bartholomew sholto
he take with him however a rather curious associate who get over this difficulty but dip his naked foot into creasote whence come toby and a six mile limp for a half pay officer with a damage tendo achillis
but it be the associate and not jonathan who commit the crime
quite so
and rather to jonathan's disgust to judge by the way he stamp about when he get into the room
he bore no grudge against bartholomew sholto and would have prefer if he could have be simply bind and gag
he do not wish to put his head in a halter
there be no help for it however the savage instincts of his companion have break out and the poison have do its work so jonathan small leave his record lower the treasure box to the grind and follow it himself
that be the train of events as far as i can decipher them
of course as to his personal appearance he must be middle age and must be sunburn after serve his time in such an oven as the andamans
his height be readily calculate from the length of his stride and we know that he be beard
his hairiness be the one point which impress itself upon thaddeus sholto when he saw him at the window
i don't know that there be anything else
the associate
ah well there be no great mystery in that
but you will know all about it soon enough
how sweet the morning air be
see how that one little cloud float like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo
now the red rim of the sun push itself over the london cloud bank
it shin on a good many folk but on none i dare bet who be on a stranger errand than you and i how small we feel with our petty ambition and strive in the presence of the great elemental force of nature
be you well up in your jean paul
fairly so
i work back to him through carlyle
that be like follow the brook to the parent lake
he make one curious but profound remark
it be that the chief proof of man's real greatness lie in his perception of his own smallness
it argue you see a power of comparison and of appreciation which be in itself a proof of nobility
there be much food for think in richter
you have not a pistol have you
i have my stick
it be just possible that we may need something of the sort if we get to their lair
jonathan i shall leave to you but if the other turn nasty i shall shoot him dead
he take out his revolver as he speak and have load two of the chamber he put it back into the right hand pocket of his jacket
we have during this time be follow the guidance of toby down the half rural villa line roads which lead to the metropolis
now however we be begin to come among continuous streets where laborers and dockmen be already astir and slatternly women be take down shutter and brush door step
at the square top corner public house business be just begin and rough look men be emerge rub their sleeves across their beard after their morning wet
strange dog saunter up and star wonderingly at us as we pass but our inimitable toby look neither to the right nor to the leave but trot onwards with his nose to the grind and an occasional eager whine which speak of a hot scent
we have traverse streatham brixton camberwell and now find ourselves in kennington lane have bear away through the side streets to the east of the oval
the men whom we pursue seem to have take a curiously zigzag road with the idea probably of escape observation
they have never keep to the main road if a parallel side street would serve their turn
at the foot of kennington lane they have edge away to the leave through bond street and miles street
where the latter street turn into knight's place toby cease to advance but begin to run backwards and forward with one ear cock and the other droop the very picture of canine indecision
then he waddle round in circle look up to us from time to time as if to ask for sympathy in his embarrassment
what the deuce be the matter with the dog
growl holmes
they surely would not take a cab or go off in a balloon
perhaps they stand here for some time i suggest
ah
it's all right
he's off again say my companion in a tone of relief
he be indeed off for after sniff round again he suddenly make up his mind and dart away with an energy and determination such as he have not yet show
the scent appear to be much hotter than before for he have not even to put his nose on the grind but tug at his leash and try to break into a run
i cold see by the gleam in holmes's eye that he think we be near the end of our journey
our course now run down nine elms until we come to broderick and nelson's large timber yard just past the white eagle tavern
here the dog frantic with excitement turn down through the side gate into the enclosure where the sawyers be already at work
on the dog race through sawdust and shave down an alley round a passage between two wood pile and finally with a triumphant yelp spring upon a large barrel which still stand upon the hand trolley on which it have be bring
with loll tongue and blink eye toby stand upon the cask look from one to the other of us for some sign of appreciation
the stave of the barrel and the wheel of the trolley be smear with a dark liquid and the whole air be heavy with the smell of creasote
sherlock holmes and i look blankly at each other and then burst simultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter
what now
i ask
toby have lose his character for infallibility
he act accord to his light say holmes lift him down from the barrel and walk him out of the timber yard
if you consider how much creasote be cart about london in one day it be no great wonder that our trail should have be cross
it be much use now especially for the season of wood
poor toby be not to blame
we must get on the main scent again i suppose
yes
and fortunately we have no distance to go
evidently what puzzle the dog at the corner of knight's place be that there be two different trail run in opposite directions
we take the wrong one
it only remain to follow the other
there be no difficulty about this
on lead toby to the place where he have commit his fault he cast about in a wide circle and finally dash off in a fresh direction
we must take care that he do not now bring us to the place where the creasote barrel come from i observe
i have think of that
but you notice that he keep on the pavement whereas the barrel pass down the roadway
no we be on the true scent now
it tend down towards the river side run through belmont place and prince's street
at the end of broad street it run right down to the water's edge where there be a small wooden wharf
toby lead us to the very edge of this and there stand whine look out on the dark current beyond
we be out of luck say holmes
they have take to a boat here
several small punt and skiffs be lie about in the water and on the edge of the wharf
we take toby round to each in turn but though he sniff earnestly he make no sign
close to the rude land stage be a small brick house with a wooden placard sling out through the second window
mordecai smith be print across it in large letter and underneath boat to hire by the hour or day
a second inscription above the door inform us that a steam launch be keep a statement which be confirm by a great pile of coke upon the jetty
sherlock holmes look slowly round and his face assume an ominous expression
this look bad say he
these fellows be sharper than i expect
they seem to have cover their track
there have i fear be preconcerted management here
he be approach the door of the house when it open and a little curly head lad of six come run out follow by a stoutish red face woman with a large sponge in her hand
you come back and be wash jack she shout
come back you young imp for if your father come home and find you like that he'll let us hear of it
dear little chap
say holmes strategically
what a rosy cheek young rascal
now jack be there anything you would like
the youth ponder for a moment
i'd like a shillin' say he
nothing you would like better
i'd like two shillin' better the prodigy answer after some think
here you be then
catch a fine child mrs
smith
lor' bless you sir he be that and forward
he get a'most too much for me to manage 'specially when my man be away days at a time
away be he
say holmes in a disappoint voice
i be sorry for that for i want to speak to mr
smith
he's be away since yesterday mornin' sir and truth to tell i be beginnin' to feel frighten about him
but if it be about a boat sir maybe i could serve as well
i want to hire his steam launch
why bless you sir it be in the steam launch that he have go
that's what puzzle me for i know there ain't more coal in her than would take her to about woolwich and back
if he'd be away in the barge i'd ha' think nothin' for many a time a job have take him as far as gravesend and then if there be much doin' there he might ha' stay over
but what good be a steam launch without coal
he might have buy some at a wharf down the river
he might sir but it weren't his way
many a time i've hear him call out at the price they charge for a few odd bag
besides i don't like that wooden legged man wi' his ugly face and outlandish talk
what do he want always knockin' about here for
a wooden legged man
say holmes with bland surprise
yes sir a brown monkey face chap that's call more'n once for my old man
it be him that rouse him up yesternight and what's more my man know he be comin' for he have steam up in the launch
i tell you straight sir i don't feel easy in my mind about it
but my dear mrs
smith say holmes shrug his shoulder you be frighten yourself about nothing
how could you possibly tell that it be the wooden legged man who come in the night
i don't quite understand how you can be so sure
his voice sir
i know his voice which be kind o' thick and foggy
he tap at the winder about three it would be
'show a leg matey ' say he 'time to turn out guard '
my old man wake up jim that's my eldest and away they go without so much as a word to me
i could hear the wooden leg clackin' on the stone
and be this wooden legged man alone
couldn't say i be sure sir
i didn't hear no one else
i be sorry mrs
smith for i want a steam launch and i have hear good report of the let me see what be her name
the aurora sir
ah
she's not that old green launch with a yellow line very broad in the beam
no indeed
she's as trim a little thing as any on the river
she's be fresh paint black with two red streak
thank
i hope that you will hear soon from mr
smith
i be go down the river and if i should see anything of the aurora i shall let him know that you be uneasy
a black funnel you say
no sir
black with a white band
ah of course
it be the side which be black
good morning mrs
smith there be a boatman here with a wherry watson
we shall take it and cross the river
the main thing with people of that sort say holmes as we sit in the sheet of the wherry be never to let them think that their information can be of the slightest importance to you
if you do they will instantly shut up like an oyster
if you listen to them under protest as it be you be very likely to get what you want
our course now seem pretty clear say i
what would you do then
i would engage a launch and go down the river on the track of the aurora
my dear fellow it would be a colossal task
she may have touch at any wharf on either side of the stream between here and greenwich
below the bridge there be a perfect labyrinth of land place for miles
it would take you days and days to exhaust them if you set about it alone
employ the police then
no
i shall probably call athelney jones in at the last moment
he be not a bad fellow and i should not like to do anything which would injure him professionally
but i have a fancy for work it out myself now that we have go so far
could we advertise then ask for information from wharfingers
worse and worse
our men would know that the chase be hot at their heel and they would be off out of the country
as it be they be likely enough to leave but as long as they think they be perfectly safe they will be in no hurry
jones's energy will be of use to us there for his view of the case be sure to push itself into the daily press and the runaways will think that every one be off on the wrong scent
what be we to do then
i ask as we land near millbank penitentiary
take this hansom drive home have some breakfast and get an hour's sleep
it be quite on the card that we may be afoot to night again
stop at a telegraph office cabby
we will keep toby for he may be of use to us yet
we pull up at the great peter street post office and holmes despatch his wire
whom do you think that be to
he ask as we resume our journey
i be sure i don't know
you remember the baker street division of the detective police force whom i employ in the jefferson hope case
well say i laugh
this be just the case where they might be invaluable
if they fail i have other resources but i shall try them first
that wire be to my dirty little lieutenant wiggins and i expect that he and his gang will be with us before we have finish our breakfast
it be between eight and nine o'clock now and i be conscious of a strong reaction after the successive excitements of the night
i be limp and weary befog in mind and fatigue in body
i have not the professional enthusiasm which carry my companion on nor could i look at the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem
as far as the death of bartholomew sholto go i have hear little good of him and could feel no intense antipathy to his murderers
the treasure however be a different matter
that or part of it belong rightfully to miss morstan
while there be a chance of recover it i be ready to devote my life to the one object
true if i find it it would probably put her forever beyond my reach
yet it would be a petty and selfish love which would be influence by such a think as that
if holmes could work to find the criminals i have a tenfold stronger reason to urge me on to find the treasure
a bath at baker street and a complete change freshen me up wonderfully
when i come down to our room i find the breakfast lay and home pour out the coffee
here it be say he laugh and point to an open newspaper
the energetic jones and the ubiquitous reporter have fix it up between them
but you have have enough of the case
better have your ham and egg first
i take the paper from him and read the short notice which be head mysterious business at upper norwood
about twelve o'clock last night say the standard mr
bartholomew sholto of pondicherry lodge upper norwood be find dead in his room under circumstances which point to foul play
as far as we can learn no actual trace of violence be find upon mr
sholto's person but a valuable collection of indian gems which the decease gentleman have inherit from his father have be carry off
the discovery be first make by mr
sherlock holmes and dr
watson who have call at the house with mr
thaddeus sholto brother of the decease
by a singular piece of good fortune mr
athelney jones the well know member of the detective police force happen to be at the norwood police station and be on the grind within half an hour of the first alarm
his train and experience faculties be at once direct towards the detection of the criminals with the gratify result that the brother thaddeus sholto have already be arrest together with the housekeeper mrs
bernstone an indian butler name lal rao and a porter or gatekeeper name mcmurdo
it be quite certain that the thief or thieve be well acquaint with the house for mr
jones's well know technical knowledge and his power of minute observation have enable him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not have enter by the door or by the window but must have make their way across the roof of the build and so through a trap door into a room which communicate with that in which the body be find
this fact which have be very clearly make out prove conclusively that it be no mere haphazard burglary
the prompt and energetic action of the officer of the law show the great advantage of the presence on such occasion of a single vigorous and masterful mind
we cannot but think that it supply an argument to those who would wish to see our detectives more decentralize and so bring into closer and more effective touch with the case which it be their duty to investigate
isn't it gorgeous
say holmes grin over his coffee cup
what do you think of it
i think that we have have a close shave ourselves of be arrest for the crime
so do i i wouldn't answer for our safety now if he should happen to have another of his attack of energy
at this moment there be a loud ring at the bell and i could hear mrs
hudson our landlady raise her voice in a wail of expostulation and dismay
by heaven holmes i say half rise i believe that they be really after us
no it's not quite so bad as that
it be the unofficial force the baker street irregulars
as he speak there come a swift patter of naked feet upon the stairs a clatter of high voice and in rush a dozen dirty and rag little street arabs
there be some show of discipline among them despite their tumultuous entry for they instantly draw up in line and stand face us with expectant face
one of their number taller and older than the others stand forward with an air of lounge superiority which be very funny in such a disreputable little scarecrow
get your message sir say he and bring 'em on sharp
three bob and a tanner for ticket
here you be say holmes produce some silver
in future they can report to you wiggins and you to me
i cannot have the house invade in this way
however it be just as well that you should all hear the instructions
i want to find the whereabouts of a steam launch call the aurora owner mordecai smith black with two red streak funnel black with a white band
she be down the river somewhere
i want one boy to be at mordecai smith's land stage opposite millbank to say if the boat come back
you must divide it out among yourselves and do both bank thoroughly
let me know the moment you have news
be that all clear
yes guv'nor say wiggins
the old scale of pay and a guinea to the boy who find the boat
here's a day in advance
now off you go
he hand them a shill each and away they buzz down the stairs and i saw them a moment later stream down the street
if the launch be above water they will find her say holmes as he rise from the table and light his pipe
they can go everywhere see everything overhear every one
i expect to hear before even that they have spot her
in the mean while we can do nothing but await result
we cannot pick up the break trail until we find either the aurora or mr
mordecai smith
toby could eat these scrap i dare say
be you go to bed holmes
no i be not tire
i have a curious constitution
i never remember feel tire by work though idleness exhaust me completely
i be go to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fair client have introduce us
if ever man have an easy task this of ours ought to be
wooden legged men be not so common but the other man must i should think be absolutely unique
that other man again
i have no wish to make a mystery of him to you anyway
but you must have form your own opinion
now do consider the data
diminutive footmarks toe never fetter by boot naked feet stone head wooden mace great agility small poison dart
what do you make of all this
a savage
i exclaim
perhaps one of those indians who be the associate of jonathan small
hardly that say he
when first i saw sign of strange weapons i be incline to think so but the remarkable character of the footmarks cause me to reconsider my view
some of the inhabitants of the indian peninsula be small men but none could have leave such mark as that
the hindoo proper have long and thin feet
the sandal wear mohammedan have the great toe well separate from the others because the thong be commonly pass between
these little dart too could only be shoot in one way
they be from a blow pipe
now then where be we to find our savage
south american i hazard
he stretch his hand up and take down a bulky volume from the shelf
this be the first volume of a gazetteer which be now be publish
it may be look upon as the very latest authority
what have we here
'andaman islands situate miles to the north of sumatra in the bay of bengal '
hum
hum
what's all this
moist climate coral reef shark port blair convict barrack rutland island cottonwoods ah here we be
'the aborigines of the andaman islands may perhaps claim the distinction of be the smallest race upon this earth though some anthropologists prefer the bushmen of africa the digger indians of america and the terra del fuegians
the average height be rather below four feet although many full grow adults may be find who be very much smaller than this
they be a fierce morose and intractable people though capable of form most devote friendships when their confidence have once be gain '
mark that watson
now then listen to this
'they be naturally hideous have large misshapen head small fierce eye and distort feature
their feet and hand however be remarkably small
so intractable and fierce be they that all the efforts of the british official have fail to win them over in any degree
they have always be a terror to shipwreck crew brain the survivors with their stone head club or shoot them with their poison arrows
these massacre be invariably conclude by a cannibal feast '
nice amiable people watson
if this fellow have be leave to his own unaided devices this affair might have take an even more ghastly turn
i fancy that even as it be jonathan small would give a good deal not to have employ him
but how come he to have so singular a companion
ah that be more than i can tell
since however we have already determine that small have come from the andamans it be not so very wonderful that this islander should be with him
no doubt we shall know all about it in time
look here watson you look regularly do
lie down there on the sofa and see if i can put you to sleep
he take up his violin from the corner and as i stretch myself out he begin to play some low dreamy melodious air his own no doubt for he have a remarkable gift for improvisation
i have a vague remembrance of his gaunt limbs his earnest face and the rise and fall of his bow
then i seem to be float peacefully away upon a soft sea of sound until i find myself in dream land with the sweet face of mary morstan look down upon me
it be late in the afternoon before i wake strengthen and refresh
sherlock holmes still sit exactly as i have leave him save that he have lay aside his violin and be deep in a book
he look across at me as i stir and i notice that his face be dark and trouble
you have sleep soundly he say
i fear that our talk would wake you
i hear nothing i answer
have you have fresh news then
unfortunately no
i confess that i be surprise and disappoint
i expect something definite by this time
wiggins have just be up to report
he say that no trace can be find of the launch
it be a provoke check for every hour be of importance
can i do anything
i be perfectly fresh now and quite ready for another night's out
no we can do nothing
we can only wait
if we go ourselves the message might come in our absence and delay be cause
you can do what you will but i must remain on guard
then i shall run over to camberwell and call upon mrs
cecil forrester
she ask me to yesterday
on mrs
cecil forrester
ask holmes with the twinkle of a smile in his eye
well of course miss morstan too
they be anxious to hear what happen
i would not tell them too much say holmes
women be never to be entirely trust not the best of them
i do not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment
i shall be back in an hour or two i remark
all right
good luck
but i say if you be cross the river you may as well return toby for i don't think it be at all likely that we shall have any use for him now
i take our mongrel accordingly and leave him together with a half sovereign at the old naturalist's in pinchin lane
at camberwell i find miss morstan a little weary after her night's adventure but very eager to hear the news
mrs
forrester too be full of curiosity
i tell them all that we have do suppress however the more dreadful part of the tragedy
thus although i speak of mr
sholto's death i say nothing of the exact manner and method of it
with all my omissions however there be enough to startle and amaze them
it be a romance
cry mrs
forrester
an injure lady half a million in treasure a black cannibal and a wooden legged ruffian
they take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl
and two knight errants to the rescue add miss morstan with a bright glance at me
why mary your fortune depend upon the issue of this search
i don't think that you be nearly excite enough
just imagine what it must be to be so rich and to have the world at your feet
it send a little thrill of joy to my heart to notice that she show no sign of elation at the prospect
on the contrary she give a toss of her proud head as though the matter be one in which she take small interest
it be for mr
thaddeus sholto that i be anxious she say
nothing else be of any consequence but i think that he have behave most kindly and honorably throughout
it be our duty to clear him of this dreadful and unfounded charge
it be even before i leave camberwell and quite dark by the time i reach home
my companion's book and pipe lay by his chair but he have disappear
i look about in the hope of see a note but there be none
i suppose that mr
sherlock holmes have go out i say to mrs
hudson as she come up to lower the blind
no sir
he have go to his room sir
do you know sir sink her voice into an impressive whisper i be afraid for his health
why so mrs
hudson
well he's that strange sir
after you be go he walk and he walk up and down and up and down until i be weary of the sound of his footstep
then i hear him talk to himself and mutter and every time the bell ring out he come on the stairhead with 'what be that mrs
hudson '
and now he have slam off to his room but i can hear him walk away the same as ever
i hope he's not go to be ill sir
i venture to say something to him about cool medicine but he turn on me sir with such a look that i don't know how ever i get out of the room
i don't think that you have any cause to be uneasy mrs
hudson i answer
i have see him like this before
he have some small matter upon his mind which make him restless
i try to speak lightly to our worthy landlady but i be myself somewhat uneasy when through the long night i still from time to time hear the dull sound of his tread and know how his keen spirit be chafe against this involuntary inaction
at breakfast time he look wear and haggard with a little fleck of feverish color upon either cheek
you be knock yourself up old man i remark
i hear you march about in the night
no i could not sleep he answer
this infernal problem be consume me
it be too much to be balk by so petty an obstacle when all else have be overcome
i know the men the launch everything and yet i can get no news
i have set other agencies at work and use every mean at my disposal
the whole river have be search on either side but there be no news nor have mrs
smith hear of her husband
i shall come to the conclusion soon that they have scuttle the craft
but there be objections to that
or that mrs
smith have put us on a wrong scent
no i think that may be dismiss
i have inquiries make and there be a launch of that description
could it have go up the river
i have consider that possibility too and there be a search party who will work up as far as richmond
if no news come to day i shall start off myself to morrow and go for the men rather than the boat
but surely surely we shall hear something
we do not however
not a word come to us either from wiggins or from the other agencies
there be article in most of the paper upon the norwood tragedy
they all appear to be rather hostile to the unfortunate thaddeus sholto
no fresh detail be to be find however in any of them save that an inquest be to be hold upon the follow day
i walk over to camberwell in the even to report our ill success to the ladies and on my return i find holmes deject and somewhat morose
he would hardly reply to my question and busy himself all even in an abstruse chemical analysis which involve much heat of retort and distil of vapors end at last in a smell which fairly drive me out of the apartment
up to the small hours of the morning i could hear the clink of his test tube which tell me that he be still engage in his malodorous experiment
in the early dawn i wake with a start and be surprise to find him stand by my bedside clothe in a rude sailor dress with a pea jacket and a coarse red scarf round his neck
i be off down the river watson say he
i have be turn it over in my mind and i can see only one way out of it
it be worth try at all events
surely i can come with you then
say i
no you can be much more useful if you will remain here as my representative
i be loath to go for it be quite on the card that some message may come during the day though wiggins be despondent about it last night
i want you to open all note and telegrams and to act on your own judgment if any news should come
can i rely upon you
most certainly
i be afraid that you will not be able to wire to me for i can hardly tell yet where i may find myself
if i be in luck however i may not be go so very long
i shall have news of some sort or other before i get back
i have hear nothing of him by breakfast time
on open the standard however i find that there be a fresh allusion to the business
with reference to the upper norwood tragedy it remark we have reason to believe that the matter promise to be even more complex and mysterious than be originally suppose
fresh evidence have show that it be quite impossible that mr
thaddeus sholto could have be in any way concern in the matter
he and the housekeeper mrs
bernstone be both release yesterday even
it be believe however that the police have a clue as to the real culprits and that it be be prosecute by mr
athelney jones of scotland yard with all his well know energy and sagacity
further arrest may be expect at any moment
that be satisfactory so far as it go think i
friend sholto be safe at any rate
i wonder what the fresh clue may be though it seem to be a stereotype form whenever the police have make a blunder
i toss the paper down upon the table but at that moment my eye catch an advertisement in the agony column
it run in this way lose whereas mordecai smith boatman and his son jim leave smith's wharf at or about three o'clock last tuesday morning in the steam launch aurora black with two red strip funnel black with a white band the sum of five pound will be pay to any one who can give information to mrs
smith at smith's wharf or at 221b baker street as to the whereabouts of the say mordecai smith and the launch aurora
this be clearly holmes's do
the baker street address be enough to prove that
it strike me as rather ingenious because it might be read by the fugitives without their see in it more than the natural anxiety of a wife for her miss husband
it be a long day
every time that a knock come to the door or a sharp step pass in the street i imagine that it be either holmes return or an answer to his advertisement
i try to read but my thoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill assort and villainous pair whom we be pursue
could there be i wonder some radical flaw in my companion's reason
might he be suffer from some huge self deception
be it not possible that his nimble and speculative mind have build up this wild theory upon faulty premise
i have never know him to be wrong and yet the keenest reasoner may occasionally be deceive
he be likely i think to fall into error through the over refinement of his logic his preference for a subtle and bizarre explanation when a plainer and more commonplace one lay ready to his hand
yet on the other hand i have myself see the evidence and i have hear the reason for his deductions
when i look back on the long chain of curious circumstances many of them trivial in themselves but all tend in the same direction i could not disguise from myself that even if holmes's explanation be incorrect the true theory must be equally outre and startle
at three o'clock in the afternoon there be a loud peal at the bell an authoritative voice in the hall and to my surprise no less a person than mr
athelney jones be show up to me
very different be he however from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who have take over the case so confidently at upper norwood
his expression be downcast and his bear meek and even apologetic
good day sir good day say he
mr
sherlock holmes be out i understand
yes and i cannot be sure when he will be back
but perhaps you would care to wait
take that chair and try one of these cigars
thank you i don't mind if i do say he mop his face with a red bandanna handkerchief
and a whiskey and soda
well half a glass
it be very hot for the time of year and i have have a good deal to worry and try me
you know my theory about this norwood case
i remember that you express one
well i have be oblige to reconsider it
i have my net draw tightly round mr
sholto sir when pop he go through a hole in the middle of it
he be able to prove an alibi which could not be shake
from the time that he leave his brother's room he be never out of sight of some one or other
so it could not be he who climb over roof and through trap doors
it's a very dark case and my professional credit be at stake
i should be very glad of a little assistance
we all need help sometimes say i
your friend mr
sherlock holmes be a wonderful man sir say he in a husky and confidential voice
he's a man who be not to be beat
i have know that young man go into a good many case but i never saw the case yet that he could not throw a light upon
he be irregular in his methods and a little quick perhaps in jump at theories but on the whole i think he would have make a most promise officer and i don't care who know it
i have have a wire from him this morning by which i understand that he have get some clue to this sholto business
here be the message
he take the telegram out of his pocket and hand it to me
it be date from poplar at twelve o'clock
go to baker street at once it say
if i have not return wait for me
i be close on the track of the sholto gang
you can come with us to night if you want to be in at the finish
this sound well
he have evidently pick up the scent again say i
ah then he have be at fault too exclaim jones with evident satisfaction
even the best of us be throw off sometimes
of course this may prove to be a false alarm but it be my duty as an officer of the law to allow no chance to slip
but there be some one at the door
perhaps this be he
a heavy step be hear ascend the stair with a great wheeze and rattle as from a man who be sorely put to it for breath
once or twice he stop as though the climb be too much for him but at last he make his way to our door and enter
his appearance correspond to the sound which we have hear
he be an age man clothe in seafaring garb with an old pea jacket button up to his throat
his back be bow his knees be shaky and his breathe be painfully asthmatic
as he lean upon a thick oaken cudgel his shoulder heave in the effort to draw the air into his lungs
he have a color scarf round his chin and i could see little of his face save a pair of keen dark eye overhang by bushy white brows and long gray side whisker
altogether he give me the impression of a respectable master mariner who have fall into years and poverty
what be it my man
i ask
he look about him in the slow methodical fashion of old age
be mr
sherlock holmes here
say he
no but i be act for him
you can tell me any message you have for him
it be to him himself i be to tell it say he
but i tell you that i be act for him
be it about mordecai smith's boat
yes
i know well where it be
an' i know where the men he be after be
an' i know where the treasure be
i know all about it
then tell me and i shall let him know
it be to him i be to tell it he repeat with the petulant obstinacy of a very old man
well you must wait for him
no no i ain't goin' to lose a whole day to please no one
if mr
holmes ain't here then mr
holmes must find it all out for himself
i don't care about the look of either of you and i won't tell a word
he shuffle towards the door but athelney jones get in front of him
wait a bite my friend say he
you have important information and you must not walk off
we shall keep you whether you like or not until our friend return
the old man make a little run towards the door but as athelney jones put his broad back up against it he recognize the uselessness of resistance
pretty sort o' treatment this
he cry stamp his stick
i come here to see a gentleman and you two who i never saw in my life seize me and treat me in this fashion
you will be none the worse i say
we shall recompense you for the loss of your time
sit over here on the sofa and you will not have long to wait
he come across sullenly enough and seat himself with his face rest on his hand
jones and i resume our cigars and our talk
suddenly however holmes's voice break in upon us
i think that you might offer me a cigar too he say
we both start in our chair
there be holmes sit close to us with an air of quiet amusement
holmes
i exclaim
you here
but where be the old man
here be the old man say he hold out a heap of white hair
here he be wig whisker eyebrows and all
i think my disguise be pretty good but i hardly expect that it would stand that test
ah you rogue
cry jones highly delight
you would have make an actor and a rare one
you have the proper workhouse cough and those weak legs of yours be worth ten pound a week
i think i know the glint of your eye though
you didn't get away from us so easily you see
i have be work in that get up all day say he light his cigar
you see a good many of the criminal class begin to know me especially since our friend here take to publish some of my case so i can only go on the war path under some simple disguise like this
you get my wire
yes that be what bring me here
how have your case prosper
it have all come to nothing
i have have to release two of my prisoners and there be no evidence against the other two
never mind
we shall give you two others in the place of them
but you must put yourself under my order
you be welcome to all the official credit but you must act on the line that i point out
be that agree
entirely if you will help me to the men
well then in the first place i shall want a fast police boat a steam launch to be at the westminster stairs at seven o'clock
that be easily manage
there be always one about there but i can step across the road and telephone to make sure
then i shall want two stanch men in case of resistance
there will be two or three in the boat
what else
when we secure the men we shall get the treasure
i think that it would be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to the young lady to whom half of it rightfully belong
let her be the first to open it eh watson
it would be a great pleasure to me
rather an irregular proceed say jones shake his head
however the whole thing be irregular and i suppose we must wink at it
the treasure must afterwards be hand over to the authorities until after the official investigation
certainly
that be easily manage
one other point
i should much like to have a few detail about this matter from the lips of jonathan small himself
you know i like to work the detail of my case out
there be no objection to my have an unofficial interview with him either here in my room or elsewhere as long as he be efficiently guard
well you be master of the situation
i have have no proof yet of the existence of this jonathan small
however if you can catch him i don't see how i can refuse you an interview with him
that be understand then
perfectly
be there anything else
only that i insist upon your din with us
it will be ready in half an hour
i have oyster and a brace of grouse with something a little choice in white win watson you have never yet recognize my merit as a housekeeper
our meal be a merry one
holmes could talk exceedingly well when he choose and that night he do choose
he appear to be in a state of nervous exaltation
i have never know him so brilliant
he speak on a quick succession of subject on miracle play on medieval pottery on stradivarius violins on the buddhism of ceylon and on the war ship of the future handle each as though he have make a special study of it
his bright humor mark the reaction from his black depression of the precede days
athelney jones prove to be a sociable soul in his hours of relaxation and face his dinner with the air of a bon vivant
for myself i felt elate at the think that we be near the end of our task and i catch something of holmes's gaiety
none of us allude during dinner to the cause which have bring us together
when the cloth be clear holmes glance at his watch and fill up three glass with port
one bumper say he to the success of our little expedition
and now it be high time we be off
have you a pistol watson
i have my old service revolver in my desk
you have best take it then
it be well to be prepare
i see that the cab be at the door
i order it for half past six
it be a little past seven before we reach the westminster wharf and find our launch await us
holmes eye it critically
be there anything to mark it as a police boat
yes that green lamp at the side
then take it off
the small change be make we step on board and the rope be cast off
jones holmes and i sit in the stern
there be one man at the rudder one to tend the engines and two burly police inspectors forward
where to
ask jones
to the tower
tell them to stop opposite jacobson's yard
our craft be evidently a very fast one
we shoot past the long line of load barge as though they be stationary
holmes smile with satisfaction as we overhaul a river steamer and leave her behind us
we ought to be able to catch anything on the river he say
well hardly that
but there be not many launch to beat us
we shall have to catch the aurora and she have a name for be a clipper
i will tell you how the land lie watson
you recollect how annoy i be at be balk by so small a thing
yes
well i give my mind a thorough rest by plunge into a chemical analysis
one of our greatest statesmen have say that a change of work be the best rest
so it be
when i have succeed in dissolve the hydrocarbon which i be at work at i come back to our problem of the sholtos and think the whole matter out again
my boys have be up the river and down the river without result
the launch be not at any land stage or wharf nor have it return
yet it could hardly have be scuttle to hide their trace though that always remain as a possible hypothesis if all else fail
i know this man small have a certain degree of low cunning but i do not think him capable of anything in the nature of delicate finesse
that be usually a product of higher education
i then reflect that since he have certainly be in london some time as we have evidence that he maintain a continual watch over pondicherry lodge he could hardly leave at a moment's notice but would need some little time if it be only a day to arrange his affairs
that be the balance of probability at any rate
it seem to me to be a little weak say i
it be more probable that he have arrange his affairs before ever he set out upon his expedition
no i hardly think so
this lair of his would be too valuable a retreat in case of need for him to give it up until he be sure that he could do without it
but a second consideration strike me
jonathan small must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion however much he may have top coat him would give rise to gossip and possibly be associate with this norwood tragedy
he be quite sharp enough to see that
they have start from their head quarter under cover of darkness and he would wish to get back before it be broad light
now it be past three o'clock accord to mrs
smith when they get the boat
it would be quite bright and people would be about in an hour or so
therefore i argue they do not go very far
they pay smith well to hold his tongue reserve his launch for the final escape and hurry to their lodge with the treasure box
in a couple of nights when they have time to see what view the paper take and whether there be any suspicion they would make their way under cover of darkness to some ship at gravesend or in the down where no doubt they have already arrange for passages to america or the colonies
but the launch
they could not have take that to their lodge
quite so
i argue that the launch must be no great way off in spite of its invisibility
i then put myself in the place of small and look at it as a man of his capacity would
he would probably consider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make pursuit easy if the police do happen to get on his track
how then could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when want
i wonder what i should do myself if i be in his shoe
i could only think of one way of do it
i might land the launch over to some boat builder or repairer with directions to make a trifle change in her
she would then be remove to his shed or yard and so be effectually conceal while at the same time i could have her at a few hours' notice
that seem simple enough
it be just these very simple things which be extremely liable to be overlook
however i determine to act on the idea
i start at once in this harmless seaman's rig and inquire at all the yards down the river
i draw blank at fifteen but at the sixteenth jacobson's i learn that the aurora have be hand over to them two days ago by a wooden legged man with some trivial directions as to her rudder
'there ain't naught amiss with her rudder ' say the foreman
'there she lie with the red streak '
at that moment who should come down but mordecai smith the miss owner
he be rather the worse for liquor
i should not of course have know him but he bellow out his name and the name of his launch
'i want her to night at eight o'clock ' say he 'eight o'clock sharp mind for i have two gentlemen who won't be keep wait '
they have evidently pay him well for he be very flush of money chuck shill about to the men
i follow him some distance but he subside into an ale house so i go back to the yard and happen to pick up one of my boys on the way i station him as a sentry over the launch
he be to stand at water's edge and wave his handkerchief to us when they start
we shall be lie off in the stream and it will be a strange thing if we do not take men treasure and all
you have plan it all very neatly whether they be the right men or not say jones but if the affair be in my hand i should have have a body of police in jacobson's yard and arrest them when they come down
which would have be never
this man small be a pretty shrewd fellow
he would send a scout on ahead and if anything make him suspicious lie snug for another week
but you might have stick to mordecai smith and so be lead to their hide place say i
in that case i should have waste my day
i think that it be a hundred to one against smith know where they live
as long as he have liquor and good pay why should he ask question
they send him message what to do
no i think over every possible course and this be the best
while this conversation have be proceed we have be shoot the long series of bridge which span the thames
as we pass the city the last ray of the sun be gild the cross upon the summit of st
paul's
it be twilight before we reach the tower
that be jacobson's yard say holmes point to a bristle of masts and rig on the surrey side
cruise gently up and down here under cover of this string of lighter
he take a pair of night glass from his pocket and gaze some time at the shore
i see my sentry at his post he remark but no sign of a handkerchief
suppose we go down stream a short way and lie in wait for them say jones eagerly
we be all eager by this time even the policemen and stokers who have a very vague idea of what be go forward
we have no right to take anything for grant holmes answer
it be certainly ten to one that they go down stream but we cannot be certain
from this point we can see the entrance of the yard and they can hardly see us
it will be a clear night and plenty of light
we must stay where we be
see how the folk swarm over yonder in the gaslight
they be come from work in the yard
dirty look rascals but i suppose every one have some little immortal spark conceal about him
you would not think it to look at them
there be no a priori probability about it
a strange enigma be man
some one call him a soul conceal in an animal i suggest
winwood reade be good upon the subject say holmes
he remark that while the individual man be an insoluble puzzle in the aggregate he become a mathematical certainty
you can for example never foretell what any one man will do but you can say with precision what an average number will be up to
individuals vary but percentages remain constant
so say the statistician
but do i see a handkerchief
surely there be a white flutter over yonder
yes it be your boy i cry
i can see him plainly
and there be the aurora exclaim holmes and go like the devil
full speed ahead engineer
make after that launch with the yellow light
by heaven i shall never forgive myself if she prove to have the heel of us
she have slip unseen through the yard entrance and pass behind two or three small craft so that she have fairly get her speed up before we saw her
now she be fly down the stream near in to the shore go at a tremendous rate
jones look gravely at her and shake his head
she be very fast he say
i doubt if we shall catch her
we must catch her
cry holmes between his teeth
heap it on stokers
make her do all she can
if we burn the boat we must have them
we be fairly after her now
the furnaces roar and the powerful engines whiz and clank like a great metallic heart
her sharp steep prow cut through the river water and send two roll wave to right and to leave of us
with every throb of the engines we spring and quiver like a live thing
one great yellow lantern in our bow throw a long flicker funnel of light in front of us
right ahead a dark blur upon the water show where the aurora lay and the swirl of white foam behind her speak of the pace at which she be go
we flash past barge steamer merchant vessels in and out behind this one and round the other
voice hail us out of the darkness but still the aurora thunder on and still we follow close upon her track
pile it on men pile it on
cry holmes look down into the engine room while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager aquiline face
get every pound of steam you can
i think we gain a little say jones with his eye on the aurora
i be sure of it say i
we shall be up with her in a very few minutes
at that moment however as our evil fate would have it a tug with three barge in tow blunder in between us
it be only by put our helm hard down that we avoid a collision and before we could round them and recover our way the aurora have gain a good two hundred yards
she be still however well in view and the murky uncertain twilight be set into a clear starlit night
our boilers be strain to their utmost and the frail shell vibrate and creak with the fierce energy which be drive us along
we have shoot through the pool past the west india dock down the long deptford reach and up again after round the isle of dog
the dull blur in front of us resolve itself now clearly enough into the dainty aurora
jones turn our search light upon her so that we could plainly see the figure upon her deck
one man sit by the stern with something black between his knees over which he stoop
beside him lay a dark mass which look like a newfoundland dog
the boy hold the tiller while against the red glare of the furnace i could see old smith strip to the waist and shovel coal for dear life
they may have have some doubt at first as to whether we be really pursue them but now as we follow every wind and turn which they take there could no longer be any question about it
at greenwich we be about three hundred pace behind them
at blackwall we could not have be more than two hundred and fifty
i have course many creatures in many countries during my checker career but never do sport give me such a wild thrill as this mad fly man hunt down the thames
steadily we draw in upon them yard by yard
in the silence of the night we could hear the pant and clank of their machinery
the man in the stern still crouch upon the deck and his arm be move as though he be busy while every now and then he would look up and measure with a glance the distance which still separate us
nearer we come and nearer
jones yell to them to stop
we be not more than four boat's lengths behind them both boat fly at a tremendous pace
it be a clear reach of the river with bark level upon one side and the melancholy plumstead marshes upon the other
at our hail the man in the stern spring up from the deck and shake his two clinch fists at us curse the while in a high crack voice
he be a good size powerful man and as he stand poise himself with legs astride i could see that from the thigh downwards there be but a wooden stump upon the right side
at the sound of his strident angry cry there be movement in the huddle bundle upon the deck
it straighten itself into a little black man the smallest i have ever see with a great misshapen head and a shock of tangle dishevel hair
holmes have already draw his revolver and i whip out mine at the sight of this savage distort creature
he be wrap in some sort of dark ulster or blanket which leave only his face expose but that face be enough to give a man a sleepless night
never have i see feature so deeply mark with all bestiality and cruelty
his small eye glow and burn with a sombre light and his thick lips be writhe back from his teeth which grin and chatter at us with a half animal fury
fire if he raise his hand say holmes quietly
we be within a boat's length by this time and almost within touch of our quarry
i can see the two of them now as they stand the white man with his legs far apart shriek out curse and the unhallow dwarf with his hideous face and his strong yellow teeth gnash at us in the light of our lantern
it be well that we have so clear a view of him
even as we look he pluck out from under his cover a short round piece of wood like a school ruler and clap it to his lips
our pistols ring out together
he whirl round throw up his arm and with a kind of choke cough fell sideways into the stream
i catch one glimpse of his venomous menace eye amid the white swirl of the water
at the same moment the wooden legged man throw himself upon the rudder and put it hard down so that his boat make straight in for the southern bank while we shoot past her stern only clear her by a few feet
we be round after her in an instant but she be already nearly at the bank
it be a wild and desolate place where the moon glimmer upon a wide expanse of marsh land with pool of stagnant water and bed of decay vegetation
the launch with a dull thud run up upon the mud bank with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water
the fugitive spring out but his stump instantly sink its whole length into the sodden soil
in vain he struggle and writhe
not one step could he possibly take either forward or backwards
he yell in impotent rage and kick frantically into the mud with his other foot but his struggle only bore his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky bank
when we bring our launch alongside he be so firmly anchor that it be only by throw the end of a rope over his shoulder that we be able to haul him out and to drag him like some evil fish over our side
the two smiths father and son sit sullenly in their launch but come aboard meekly enough when command
the aurora herself we haul off and make fast to our stern
a solid iron chest of indian workmanship stand upon the deck
this there could be no question be the same that have contain the ill omen treasure of the sholtos
there be no key but it be of considerable weight so we transfer it carefully to our own little cabin
as we steam slowly up stream again we flash our search light in every direction but there be no sign of the islander
somewhere in the dark ooze at the bottom of the thames lie the bone of that strange visitor to our shore
see here say holmes point to the wooden hatchway
we be hardly quick enough with our pistols
there sure enough just behind where we have be stand stick one of those murderous dart which we know so well
it must have whiz between us at the instant that we fire
holmes smile at it and shrug his shoulder in his easy fashion but i confess that it turn me sick to think of the horrible death which have pass so close to us that night
our captive sit in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he have do so much and wait so long to gain
he be a sunburn reckless eye fellow with a net work of line and wrinkle all over his mahogany feature which tell of a hard open air life
there be a singular prominence about his beard chin which mark a man who be not to be easily turn from his purpose
his age may have be fifty or thereabouts for his black curly hair be thickly shoot with gray
his face in repose be not an unpleasing one though his heavy brows and aggressive chin give him as i have lately see a terrible expression when move to anger
he sit now with his handcuff hand upon his lap and his head sink upon his breast while he look with his keen twinkle eye at the box which have be the cause of his ill do
it seem to me that there be more sorrow than anger in his rigid and contain countenance
once he look up at me with a gleam of something like humor in his eye
well jonathan small say holmes light a cigar i be sorry that it have come to this
and so be i sir he answer frankly
i don't believe that i can swing over the job
i give you my word on the book that i never raise hand against mr
sholto
it be that little hell hound tonga who shoot one of his curse dart into him
i have no part in it sir
i be as grieve as if it have be my blood relation
i welt the little devil with the slack end of the rope for it but it be do and i could not undo it again
have a cigar say holmes and you have best take a pull out of my flask for you be very wet
how could you expect so small and weak a man as this black fellow to overpower mr
sholto and hold him while you be climb the rope
you seem to know as much about it as if you be there sir
the truth be that i hop to find the room clear
i know the habit of the house pretty well and it be the time when mr
sholto usually go down to his supper
i shall make no secret of the business
the best defence that i can make be just the simple truth
now if it have be the old major i would have swing for him with a light heart
i would have think no more of knife him than of smoke this cigar
but it's curse hard that i should be lag over this young sholto with whom i have no quarrel whatever
you be under the charge of mr
athelney jones of scotland yard
he be go to bring you up to my room and i shall ask you for a true account of the matter
you must make a clean breast of it for if you do i hope that i may be of use to you
i think i can prove that the poison act so quickly that the man be dead before ever you reach the room
that he be sir
i never get such a turn in my life as when i saw him grin at me with his head on his shoulder as i climb through the window
it fairly shake me sir
i'd have half kill tonga for it if he have not scramble off
that be how he come to leave his club and some of his dart too as he tell me which i dare say help to put you on our track though how you keep on it be more than i can tell
i don't feel no malice against you for it
but it do seem a queer thing he add with a bitter smile that i who have a fair claim to nigh upon half a million of money should spend the first half of my life build a breakwater in the andamans and be like to spend the other half dig drain at dartmoor
it be an evil day for me when first i clap eye upon the merchant achmet and have to do with the agra treasure which never bring anything but a curse yet upon the man who own it
to him it bring murder to major sholto it bring fear and guilt to me it have mean slavery for life
at this moment athelney jones thrust his broad face and heavy shoulder into the tiny cabin
quite a family party he remark
i think i shall have a pull at that flask holmes
well i think we may all congratulate each other
pity we didn't take the other alive but there be no choice
i say holmes you must confess that you cut it rather fine
it be all we could do to overhaul her
all be well that end well say holmes
but i certainly do not know that the aurora be such a clipper
smith say she be one of the fastest launch on the river and that if he have have another man to help him with the engines we should never have catch her
he swear he know nothing of this norwood business
neither he do cry our prisoner not a word
i choose his launch because i hear that she be a flier
we tell him nothing but we pay him well and he be to get something handsome if we reach our vessel the esmeralda at gravesend outward bind for the brazils
well if he have do no wrong we shall see that no wrong come to him
if we be pretty quick in catch our men we be not so quick in condemn them
it be amuse to notice how the consequential jones be already begin to give himself air on the strength of the capture
from the slight smile which play over sherlock holmes's face i could see that the speech have not be lose upon him
we will be at vauxhall bridge presently say jones and shall land you dr
watson with the treasure box
i need hardly tell you that i be take a very grave responsibility upon myself in do this
it be most irregular but of course an agreement be an agreement
i must however as a matter of duty send an inspector with you since you have so valuable a charge
you will drive no doubt
yes i shall drive
it be a pity there be no key that we may make an inventory first
you will have to break it open
where be the key my man
at the bottom of the river say small shortly
hum
there be no use your give this unnecessary trouble
we have have work enough already through you
however doctor i need not warn you to be careful
bring the box back with you to the baker street room
you will find us there on our way to the station
they land me at vauxhall with my heavy iron box and with a bluff genial inspector as my companion
a quarter of an hour's drive bring us to mrs
cecil forrester's
the servant seem surprise at so late a visitor
mrs
cecil forrester be out for the even she explain and likely to be very late
miss morstan however be in the draw room so to the draw room i go box in hand leave the oblige inspector in the cab
she be seat by the open window dress in some sort of white diaphanous material with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and waist
the soft light of a shade lamp fell upon her as she lean back in the basket chair play over her sweet grave face and tint with a dull metallic sparkle the rich coil of her luxuriant hair
one white arm and hand droop over the side of the chair and her whole pose and figure speak of an absorb melancholy
at the sound of my foot fall she spring to her feet however and a bright flush of surprise and of pleasure color her pale cheek
i hear a cab drive up she say
i think that mrs
forrester have come back very early but i never dream that it might be you
what news have you bring me
i have bring something better than news say i put down the box upon the table and speak jovially and boisterously though my heart be heavy within me
i have bring you something which be worth all the news in the world
i have bring you a fortune
she glance at the iron box
be that the treasure then
she ask coolly enough
yes this be the great agra treasure
half of it be yours and half be thaddeus sholto's
you will have a couple of hundred thousand each
think of that
an annuity of ten thousand pound
there will be few richer young ladies in england
be it not glorious
i think that i must have be rather overact my delight and that she detect a hollow ring in my congratulations for i saw her eyebrows rise a little and she glance at me curiously
if i have it say she i owe it to you
no no i answer not to me but to my friend sherlock holmes
with all the will in the world i could never have follow up a clue which have tax even his analytical genius
as it be we very nearly lose it at the last moment
pray sit down and tell me all about it dr
watson say she
i narrate briefly what have occur since i have see her last holmes's new method of search the discovery of the aurora the appearance of athelney jones our expedition in the even and the wild chase down the thames
she listen with part lips and shin eye to my recital of our adventure
when i speak of the dart which have so narrowly miss us she turn so white that i fear that she be about to faint
it be nothing she say as i hasten to pour her out some water
i be all right again
it be a shock to me to hear that i have place my friends in such horrible peril
that be all over i answer
it be nothing
i will tell you no more gloomy detail
let us turn to something brighter
there be the treasure
what could be brighter than that
i get leave to bring it with me think that it would interest you to be the first to see it
it would be of the greatest interest to me she say
there be no eagerness in her voice however
it have strike her doubtless that it might seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize which have cost so much to win
what a pretty box
she say stoop over it
this be indian work i suppose
yes it be benares metal work
and so heavy
she exclaim try to raise it
the box alone must be of some value
where be the key
small throw it into the thames i answer
i must borrow mrs
forrester's poker
there be in the front a thick and broad hasp work in the image of a sit buddha
under this i thrust the end of the poker and twist it outward as a lever
the hasp spring open with a loud snap
with tremble finger i fling back the lid
we both stand gaze in astonishment
the box be empty
no wonder that it be heavy
the iron work be two thirds of an inch thick all round
it be massive well make and solid like a chest construct to carry things of great price but not one shred or crumb of metal or jewelry lay within it
it be absolutely and completely empty
the treasure be lose say miss morstan calmly
as i listen to the word and realize what they mean a great shadow seem to pass from my soul
i do not know how this agra treasure have weigh me down until now that it be finally remove
it be selfish no doubt disloyal wrong but i could realize nothing save that the golden barrier be go from between us
thank god
i ejaculate from my very heart
she look at me with a quick question smile
why do you say that
she ask
because you be within my reach again i say take her hand
she do not withdraw it
because i love you mary as truly as ever a man love a woman
because this treasure these riches seal my lips
now that they be go i can tell you how i love you
that be why i say 'thank god '
then i say 'thank god ' too she whisper as i draw her to my side
whoever have lose a treasure i know that night that i have gain one
a very patient man be that inspector in the cab for it be a weary time before i rejoin him
his face cloud over when i show him the empty box
there go the reward
say he gloomily
where there be no money there be no pay
this night's work would have be worth a tenner each to sam brown and me if the treasure have be there
mr
thaddeus sholto be a rich man i say
he will see that you be reward treasure or no
the inspector shake his head despondently however
it's a bad job he repeat and so mr
athelney jones will think
his forecast prove to be correct for the detective look blank enough when i get to baker street and show him the empty box
they have only just arrive holmes the prisoner and he for they have change their plan so far as to report themselves at a station upon the way
my companion lounge in his arm chair with his usual listless expression while small sit stolidly opposite to him with his wooden leg cock over his sound one
as i exhibit the empty box he lean back in his chair and laugh aloud
this be your do small say athelney jones angrily
yes i have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it he cry exultantly
it be my treasure and if i can't have the loot i'll take darn good care that no one else do
i tell you that no live man have any right to it unless it be three men who be in the andaman convict barrack and myself
i know now that i cannot have the use of it and i know that they cannot
i have act all through for them as much as for myself
it's be the sign of four with us always
well i know that they would have have me do just what i have do and throw the treasure into the thames rather than let it go to kith or kin of sholto or of morstan
it be not to make them rich that we do for achmet
you'll find the treasure where the key be and where little tonga be
when i saw that your launch must catch us i put the loot away in a safe place
there be no rupees for you this journey
you be deceive us small say athelney jones sternly
if you have wish to throw the treasure into the thames it would have be easier for you to have throw box and all
easier for me to throw and easier for you to recover he answer with a shrewd sidelong look
the man that be clever enough to hunt me down be clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a river
now that they be scatter over five miles or so it may be a harder job
it go to my heart to do it though
i be half mad when you come up with us
however there's no good grieve over it
i've have up in my life and i've have down but i've learn not to cry over spill milk
this be a very serious matter small say the detective
if you have help justice instead of thwart it in this way you would have have a better chance at your trial
justice
snarl the ex convict
a pretty justice
whose loot be this if it be not ours
where be the justice that i should give it up to those who have never earn it
look how i have earn it
twenty long years in that fever ride swamp all day at work under the mangrove tree all night chain up in the filthy convict huts bite by mosquitoes rack with ague bully by every curse black face policeman who love to take it out of a white man
that be how i earn the agra treasure and you talk to me of justice because i cannot bear to feel that i have pay this price only that another may enjoy it
i would rather swing a score of time or have one of tonga's dart in my hide than live in a convict's cell and feel that another man be at his ease in a palace with the money that should be mine
small have drop his mask of stoicism and all this come out in a wild whirl of word while his eye blaze and the handcuff clank together with the impassioned movement of his hand
i could understand as i saw the fury and the passion of the man that it be no groundless or unnatural terror which have possess major sholto when he first learn that the injure convict be upon his track
you forget that we know nothing of all this say holmes quietly
we have not hear your story and we cannot tell how far justice may originally have be on your side
well sir you have be very fair speak to me though i can see that i have you to thank that i have these bracelets upon my wrists
still i bear no grudge for that
it be all fair and above board
if you want to hear my story i have no wish to hold it back
what i say to you be god's truth every word of it
thank you you can put the glass beside me here and i'll put my lips to it if i be dry
i be a worcestershire man myself bear near pershore
i dare say you would find a heap of smalls live there now if you be to look
i have often think of take a look round there but the truth be that i be never much of a credit to the family and i doubt if they would be so very glad to see me
they be all steady chapel go folk small farmers well know and respect over the country side while i be always a bite of a rover
at last however when i be about eighteen i give them no more trouble for i get into a mess over a girl and could only get out of it again by take the queen's shill and join the 3d buff which be just start for india
i wasn't destine to do much soldier however
i have just get past the goose step and learn to handle my musket when i be fool enough to go swim in the gang
luckily for me my company sergeant john holder be in the water at the same time and he be one of the finest swimmers in the service
a crocodile take me just as i be half way across and nip off my right leg as clean as a surgeon could have do it just above the knee
what with the shock and the loss of blood i faint and should have drown if holder have not catch hold of me and paddle for the bank
i be five months in hospital over it and when at last i be able to limp out of it with this timber toe strap to my stump i find myself invalid out of the army and unfit for any active occupation
i be as you can imagine pretty down on my luck at this time for i be a useless cripple though not yet in my twentieth year
however my misfortune soon prove to be a bless in disguise
a man name abelwhite who have come out there as an indigo planter want an overseer to look after his coolies and keep them up to their work
he happen to be a friend of our colonel's who have take an interest in me since the accident
to make a long story short the colonel recommend me strongly for the post and as the work be mostly to be do on horseback my leg be no great obstacle for i have enough knee leave to keep good grip on the saddle
what i have to do be to ride over the plantation to keep an eye on the men as they work and to report the idlers
the pay be fair i have comfortable quarter and altogether i be content to spend the remainder of my life in indigo plant
mr
abelwhite be a kind man and he would often drop into my little shanty and smoke a pipe with me for white folk out there feel their hearts warm to each other as they never do here at home
well i be never in luck's way long
suddenly without a note of warn the great mutiny break upon us
one month india lay as still and peaceful to all appearance as surrey or kent the next there be two hundred thousand black devil let loose and the country be a perfect hell
of course you know all about it gentlemen a deal more than i do very like since read be not in my line
i only know what i saw with my own eye
our plantation be at a place call muttra near the border of the northwest provinces
night after night the whole sky be alight with the burn bungalows and day after day we have small company of europeans pass through our estate with their wive and children on their way to agra where be the nearest troop
mr
abelwhite be an obstinate man
he have it in his head that the affair have be exaggerate and that it would blow over as suddenly as it have spring up
there he sit on his veranda drink whiskey peg and smoke cheroots while the country be in a blaze about him
of course we stick by him i and dawson who with his wife use to do the book work and the manage
well one fine day the crash come
i have be away on a distant plantation and be rid slowly home in the even when my eye fell upon something all huddle together at the bottom of a steep nullah
i ride down to see what it be and the cold strike through my heart when i find it be dawson's wife all cut into ribbons and half eat by jackals and native dog
a little further up the road dawson himself be lie on his face quite dead with an empty revolver in his hand and four sepoys lie across each other in front of him
i rein up my horse wonder which way i should turn but at that moment i saw thick smoke curl up from abelwhite's bungalow and the flame begin to burst through the roof
i know then that i could do my employer no good but would only throw my own life away if i meddle in the matter
from where i stand i could see hundreds of the black fiends with their red coat still on their back dance and howl round the burn house
some of them point at me and a couple of bullets sing past my head so i break away across the paddy field and find myself late at night safe within the wall at agra
as it prove however there be no great safety there either
the whole country be up like a swarm of be
wherever the english could collect in little band they hold just the grind that their gun command
everywhere else they be helpless fugitives
it be a fight of the millions against the hundreds and the cruellest part of it be that these men that we fight against foot horse and gunners be our own pick troop whom we have teach and train handle our own weapons and blow our own bugle call
at agra there be the 3d bengal fusiliers some sikhs two troop of horse and a battery of artillery
a volunteer corps of clerk and merchants have be form and this i join wooden leg and all
we go out to meet the rebel at shahgunge early in july and we beat them back for a time but our powder give out and we have to fall back upon the city
nothing but the worst news come to us from every side which be not to be wonder at for if you look at the map you will see that we be right in the heart of it
lucknow be rather better than a hundred miles to the east and cawnpore about as far to the south
from every point on the compass there be nothing but torture and murder and outrage
the city of agra be a great place swarm with fanatics and fierce devil worshippers of all sort
our handful of men be lose among the narrow wind streets
our leader move across the river therefore and take up his position in the old fort at agra
i don't know if any of you gentlemen have ever read or hear anything of that old fort
it be a very queer place the queerest that ever i be in and i have be in some rum corner too
first of all it be enormous in size
i should think that the enclosure must be acres and acres
there be a modern part which take all our garrison women children store and everything else with plenty of room over
but the modern part be nothing like the size of the old quarter where nobody go and which be give over to the scorpions and the centipedes
it be all full of great desert halls and wind passages and long corridors twist in and out so that it be easy enough for folk to get lose in it
for this reason it be seldom that any one go into it though now and again a party with torch might go explore
the river wash along the front of the old fort and so protect it but on the side and behind there be many doors and these have to be guard of course in the old quarter as well as in that which be actually hold by our troop
we be short hand with hardly men enough to man the angle of the build and to serve the gun
it be impossible for us therefore to station a strong guard at every one of the innumerable gate
what we do be to organize a central guard house in the middle of the fort and to leave each gate under the charge of one white man and two or three natives
i be select to take charge during certain hours of the night of a small isolate door upon the southwest side of the build
two sikh troopers be place under my command and i be instruct if anything go wrong to fire my musket when i might rely upon help come at once from the central guard
as the guard be a good two hundred pace away however and as the space between be cut up into a labyrinth of passages and corridors i have great doubt as to whether they could arrive in time to be of any use in case of an actual attack
well i be pretty proud at have this small command give me since i be a raw recruit and a game legged one at that
for two nights i keep the watch with my punjaubees
they be tall fierce look chap mahomet singh and abdullah khan by name both old fight men who have bear arm against us at chilian wallah
they could talk english pretty well but i could get little out of them
they prefer to stand together and jabber all night in their queer sikh lingo
for myself i use to stand outside the gate way look down on the broad wind river and on the twinkle light of the great city
the beat of drum the rattle of tomtoms and the yell and howl of the rebel drink with opium and with bang be enough to remind us all night of our dangerous neighbor across the stream
every two hours the officer of the night use to come round to all the post to make sure that all be well
the third night of my watch be dark and dirty with a small drive rain
it be dreary work stand in the gate way hour after hour in such weather
i try again and again to make my sikhs talk but without much success
at two in the morning the round pass and break for a moment the weariness of the night
find that my companion would not be lead into conversation i take out my pipe and lay down my musket to strike the match
in an instant the two sikhs be upon me
one of them snatch my firelock up and level it at my head while the other hold a great knife to my throat and swear between his teeth that he would plunge it into me if i move a step
my first think be that these fellows be in league with the rebel and that this be the begin of an assault
if our door be in the hand of the sepoys the place must fall and the women and children be treat as they be in cawnpore
maybe you gentlemen think that i be just make out a case for myself but i give you my word that when i think of that though i felt the point of the knife at my throat i open my mouth with the intention of give a scream if it be my last one which might alarm the main guard
the man who hold me seem to know my thoughts for even as i brace myself to it he whisper 'don't make a noise
the fort be safe enough
there be no rebel dog on this side of the river '
there be the ring of truth in what he say and i know that if i raise my voice i be a dead man
i could read it in the fellow's brown eye
i wait therefore in silence to see what it be that they want from me
'listen to me sahib ' say the taller and fiercer of the pair the one whom they call abdullah khan
'you must either be with us now or you must be silence forever
the thing be too great a one for us to hesitate
either you be heart and soul with us on your oath on the cross of the christians or your body this night shall be throw into the ditch and we shall pass over to our brothers in the rebel army
there be no middle way
which be it to be death or life
we can only give you three minutes to decide for the time be pass and all must be do before the round come again '
'how can i decide '
say i
'you have not tell me what you want of me
but i tell you now that if it be anything against the safety of the fort i will have no truck with it so you can drive home your knife and welcome '
'it be nothing against the fort ' say he
'we only ask you to do that which your countrymen come to this land for
we ask you to be rich
if you will be one of us this night we will swear to you upon the naked knife and by the threefold oath which no sikh be ever know to break that you shall have your fair share of the loot
a quarter of the treasure shall be yours
we can say no fairer '
'but what be the treasure then '
i ask
'i be as ready to be rich as you can be if you will but show me how it can be do '
'you will swear then ' say he 'by the bone of your father by the honor of your mother by the cross of your faith to raise no hand and speak no word against us either now or afterwards '
'i will swear it ' i answer 'provided that the fort be not endanger '
'then my comrade and i will swear that you shall have a quarter of the treasure which shall be equally divide among the four of us '
'there be but three ' say i
'no dost akbar must have his share
we can tell the tale to you while we await them
do you stand at the gate mahomet singh and give notice of their come
the thing stand thus sahib and i tell it to you because i know that an oath be bind upon a feringhee and that we may trust you
have you be a lie hindoo though you have swear by all the gods in their false temples your blood would have be upon the knife and your body in the water
but the sikh know the englishman and the englishman know the sikh
hearken then to what i have to say
'there be a rajah in the northern provinces who have much wealth though his land be small
much have come to him from his father and more still he have set by himself for he be of a low nature and hoard his gold rather than spend it
when the trouble break out he would be friends both with the lion and the tiger with the sepoy and with the company's raj
soon however it seem to him that the white men's day be come for through all the land he could hear of nothing but of their death and their overthrow
yet be a careful man he make such plan that come what might half at least of his treasure should be leave to him
that which be in gold and silver he keep by him in the vault of his palace but the most precious stone and the choicest pearl that he have he put in an iron box and send it by a trusty servant who under the guise of a merchant should take it to the fort at agra there to lie until the land be at peace
thus if the rebel win he would have his money but if the company conquer his jewel would be save to him
have thus divide his hoard he throw himself into the cause of the sepoys since they be strong upon his border
by do this mark you sahib his property become the due of those who have be true to their salt
'this pretend merchant who travel under the name of achmet be now in the city of agra and desire to gain his way into the fort
he have with him as travel companion my foster brother dost akbar who know his secret
dost akbar have promise this night to lead him to a side postern of the fort and have choose this one for his purpose
here he will come presently and here he will find mahomet singh and myself await him
the place be lonely and none shall know of his come
the world shall know of the merchant achmet no more but the great treasure of the rajah shall be divide among us
what say you to it sahib '
in worcestershire the life of a man seem a great and a sacred thing but it be very different when there be fire and blood all round you and you have be use to meet death at every turn
whether achmet the merchant live or die be a thing as light as air to me but at the talk about the treasure my heart turn to it and i think of what i might do in the old country with it and how my folk would stare when they saw their ne'er do well come back with his pocket full of gold moidores
i have therefore already make up my mind
abdullah khan however think that i hesitate press the matter more closely
'consider sahib ' say he 'that if this man be take by the commandant he will be hang or shoot and his jewel take by the government so that no man will be a rupee the better for them
now since we do the take of him why should we not do the rest as well
the jewel will be as well with us as in the company's coffers
there will be enough to make every one of us rich men and great chiefs
no one can know about the matter for here we be cut off from all men
what could be better for the purpose
say again then sahib whether you be with us or if we must look upon you as an enemy '
'i be with you heart and soul ' say i
'it be well ' he answer hand me back my firelock
'you see that we trust you for your word like ours be not to be break
we have now only to wait for my brother and the merchant '
'does your brother know then of what you will do '
i ask
'the plan be his
he have devise it
we will go to the gate and share the watch with mahomet singh '
the rain be still fall steadily for it be just the begin of the wet season
brown heavy cloud be drift across the sky and it be hard to see more than a stone cast
a deep moat lay in front of our door but the water be in place nearly dry up and it could easily be cross
it be strange to me to be stand there with those two wild punjaubees wait for the man who be come to his death
suddenly my eye catch the glint of a shade lantern at the other side of the moat
it vanish among the mound heap and then appear again come slowly in our direction
'here they be '
i exclaim
'you will challenge him sahib as usual ' whisper abdullah
'give him no cause for fear
send us in with him and we shall do the rest while you stay here on guard
have the lantern ready to uncover that we may be sure that it be indeed the man '
the light have flicker onwards now stop and now advance until i could see two dark figure upon the other side of the moat
i let them scramble down the slop bank splash through the mire and climb half way up to the gate before i challenge them
'who go there '
say i in a subdue voice
'friends ' come the answer
i uncover my lantern and throw a flood of light upon them
the first be an enormous sikh with a black beard which sweep nearly down to his cummerbund
outside of a show i have never see so tall a man
the other be a little fat round fellow with a great yellow turban and a bundle in his hand do up in a shawl
he seem to be all in a quiver with fear for his hand twitch as if he have the ague and his head keep turn to leave and right with two bright little twinkle eye like a mouse when he venture out from his hole
it give me the chill to think of kill him but i think of the treasure and my heart set as hard as a flint within me
when he saw my white face he give a little chirrup of joy and come run up towards me
'your protection sahib ' he pant 'your protection for the unhappy merchant achmet
i have travel across rajpootana that i might seek the shelter of the fort at agra
i have be rob and beat and abuse because i have be the friend of the company
it be a bless night this when i be once more in safety i and my poor possessions '
'what have you in the bundle '
i ask
'an iron box ' he answer 'which contain one or two little family matter which be of no value to others but which i should be sorry to lose
yet i be not a beggar and i shall reward you young sahib and your governor also if he will give me the shelter i ask '
i could not trust myself to speak longer with the man
the more i look at his fat frighten face the harder do it seem that we should slay him in cold blood
it be best to get it over
'take him to the main guard ' say i the two sikhs close in upon him on each side and the giant walk behind while they march in through the dark gate way
never be a man so compass round with death
i remain at the gate way with the lantern
i could hear the measure tramp of their footsteps sound through the lonely corridors
suddenly it cease and i hear voice and a scuffle with the sound of blow
a moment later there come to my horror a rush of footsteps come in my direction with the loud breathe of a run man
i turn my lantern down the long straight passage and there be the fat man run like the wind with a smear of blood across his face and close at his heel bound like a tiger the great black beard sikh with a knife flash in his hand
i have never see a man run so fast as that little merchant
he be gain on the sikh and i could see that if he once pass me and get to the open air he would save himself yet
my heart soften to him but again the think of his treasure turn me hard and bitter
i cast my firelock between his legs as he race past and he roll twice over like a shoot rabbit
ere he could stagger to his feet the sikh be upon him and bury his knife twice in his side
the man never utter moan nor move muscle but lay be he have fall
i think myself that he may have break his neck with the fall
you see gentlemen that i be keep my promise
i be tell you every work of the business just exactly as it happen whether it be in my favor or not
he stop and hold out his manacle hand for the whiskey and water which holmes have brew for him
for myself i confess that i have now conceive the utmost horror of the man not only for this cold blood business in which he have be concern but even more for the somewhat flippant and careless way in which he narrate it
whatever punishment be in store for him i felt that he might expect no sympathy from me
sherlock holmes and jones sit with their hand upon their knees deeply interest in the story but with the same disgust write upon their face
he may have observe it for there be a touch of defiance in his voice and manner as he proceed
it be all very bad no doubt say he
i should like to know how many fellows in my shoe would have refuse a share of this loot when they know that they would have their throats cut for their pain
besides it be my life or his when once he be in the fort
if he have get out the whole business would come to light and i should have be court martialled and shoot as likely as not for people be not very lenient at a time like that
go on with your story say holmes shortly
well we carry him in abdullah akbar and i a fine weight he be too for all that he be so short
mahomet singh be leave to guard the door
we take him to a place which the sikhs have already prepare
it be some distance off where a wind passage lead to a great empty hall the brick wall of which be all crumble to piece
the earth floor have sink in at one place make a natural grave so we leave achmet the merchant there have first cover him over with loose bricks
this do we all go back to the treasure
it lay where he have drop it when he be first attack
the box be the same which now lie open upon your table
a key be hang by a silken cord to that carve handle upon the top
we open it and the light of the lantern gleam upon a collection of gems such as i have read of and think about when i be a little lad at pershore
it be blind to look upon them
when we have feast our eye we take them all out and make a list of them
there be one hundred and forty three diamonds of the first water include one which have be call i believe 'the great mogul' and be say to be the second largest stone in existence
then there be ninety seven very fine emeralds and one hundred and seventy rubies some of which however be small
there be forty carbuncles two hundred and ten sapphires sixty one agates and a great quantity of beryls onyxes cats' eye turquoises and other stone the very name of which i do not know at the time though i have become more familiar with them since
besides this there be nearly three hundred very fine pearl twelve of which be set in a gold coronet
by the way these last have be take out of the chest and be not there when i recover it
after we have count our treasure we put them back into the chest and carry them to the gate way to show them to mahomet singh
then we solemnly renew our oath to stand by each other and be true to our secret
we agree to conceal our loot in a safe place until the country should be at peace again and then to divide it equally among ourselves
there be no use divide it at present for if gems of such value be find upon us it would cause suspicion and there be no privacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them
we carry the box therefore into the same hall where we have bury the body and there under certain bricks in the best preserve wall we make a hollow and put our treasure
we make careful note of the place and next day i draw four plan one for each of us and put the sign of the four of us at the bottom for we have swear that we should each always act for all so that none might take advantage
that be an oath that i can put my hand to my heart and swear that i have never break
well there's no use my tell you gentlemen what come of the indian mutiny
after wilson take delhi and sir colin relieve lucknow the back of the business be break
fresh troop come pour in and nana sahib make himself scarce over the frontier
a fly column under colonel greathed come round to agra and clear the pandies away from it
peace seem to be settle upon the country and we four be begin to hope that the time be at hand when we might safely go off with our share of the plunder
in a moment however our hop be shatter by our be arrest as the murderers of achmet
it come about in this way
when the rajah put his jewel into the hand of achmet he do it because he know that he be a trusty man
they be suspicious folk in the east however so what do this rajah do but take a second even more trusty servant and set him to play the spy upon the first
this second man be order never to let achmet out of his sight and he follow him like his shadow
he go after him that night and saw him pass through the doorway
of course he think he have take refuge in the fort and apply for admission there himself next day but could find no trace of achmet
this seem to him so strange that he speak about it to a sergeant of guide who bring it to the ears of the commandant
a thorough search be quickly make and the body be discover
thus at the very moment that we think that all be safe we be all four seize and bring to trial on a charge of murder three of us because we have hold the gate that night and the fourth because he be know to have be in the company of the murder man
not a word about the jewel come out at the trial for the rajah have be depose and drive out of india so no one have any particular interest in them
the murder however be clearly make out and it be certain that we must all have be concern in it
the three sikhs get penal servitude for life and i be condemn to death though my sentence be afterwards commute into the same as the others
it be rather a queer position that we find ourselves in then
there we be all four tie by the leg and with precious little chance of ever get out again while we each hold a secret which might have put each of us in a palace if we could only have make use of it
it be enough to make a man eat his heart out to have to stand the kick and the cuff of every petty jack in office to have rice to eat and water to drink when that gorgeous fortune be ready for him outside just wait to be pick up
it might have drive me mad but i be always a pretty stubborn one so i just hold on and bid my time
at last it seem to me to have come
i be change from agra to madras and from there to blair island in the andamans
there be very few white convict at this settlement and as i have behave well from the first i soon find myself a sort of privilege person
i be give a hut in hope town which be a small place on the slop of mount harriet and i be leave pretty much to myself
it be a dreary fever stricken place and all beyond our little clear be infest with wild cannibal natives who be ready enough to blow a poison dart at us if they saw a chance
there be dig and ditch and yam plant and a dozen other things to be do so we be busy enough all day though in the even we have a little time to ourselves
among other things i learn to dispense drug for the surgeon and pick up a smatter of his knowledge
all the time i be on the lookout for a chance of escape but it be hundreds of miles from any other land and there be little or no wind in those seas so it be a terribly difficult job to get away
the surgeon dr
somerton be a fast sport young chap and the other young officer would meet in his room of an even and play card
the surgery where i use to make up my drug be next to his sit room with a small window between us
often if i felt lonesome i use to turn out the lamp in the surgery and then stand there i could hear their talk and watch their play
i be fond of a hand at card myself and it be almost as good as have one to watch the others
there be major sholto captain morstan and lieutenant bromley brown who be in command of the native troop and there be the surgeon himself and two or three prison officials crafty old hand who play a nice sly safe game
a very snug little party they use to make
well there be one thing which very soon strike me and that be that the soldier use always to lose and the civilians to win
mind i don't say that there be anything unfair but so it be
these prison chap have do little else than play card ever since they have be at the andamans and they know each other's game to a point while the others just play to pass the time and throw their card down anyhow
night after night the soldier get up poorer men and the poorer they get the more keen they be to play
major sholto be the hardest hit
he use to pay in note and gold at first but soon it come to note of hand and for big sum
he sometimes would win for a few deal just to give him heart and then the luck would set in against him worse than ever
all day he would wander about as black as thunder and he take to drink a deal more than be good for him
one night he lose even more heavily than usual
i be sit in my hut when he and captain morstan come stumble along on the way to their quarter
they be bosom friends those two and never far apart
the major be rave about his losses
'it's all up morstan ' he be say as they pass my hut
'i shall have to send in my paper
i be a ruin man '
'nonsense old chap '
say the other slap him upon the shoulder
'i've have a nasty facer myself but ' that be all i could hear but it be enough to set me think
a couple of days later major sholto be stroll on the beach so i take the chance of speak to him
'i wish to have your advice major ' say i
'well small what be it '
he ask take his cheroot from his lips
'i want to ask you sir ' say i 'who be the proper person to whom hide treasure should be hand over
i know where half a million worth lie and as i cannot use it myself i think perhaps the best thing that i could do would be to hand it over to the proper authorities and then perhaps they would get my sentence shorten for me '
'half a million small '
he gasp look hard at me to see if i be in earnest
'quite that sir in jewel and pearl
it lie there ready for any one
and the queer thing about it be that the real owner be outlaw and cannot hold property so that it belong to the first comer '
'to government small ' he stammer 'to government '
but he say it in a halt fashion and i know in my heart that i have get him
'you think then sir that i should give the information to the governor general '
say i quietly
'well well you must not do anything rash or that you might repent
let me hear all about it small
give me the facts '
i tell him the whole story with small change so that he could not identify the place
when i have finish he stand stock still and full of think
i could see by the twitch of his lip that there be a struggle go on within him
'this be a very important matter small ' he say at last
'you must not say a word to any one about it and i shall see you again soon '
two nights later he and his friend captain morstan come to my hut in the dead of the night with a lantern
'i want you just to let captain morstan hear that story from your own lips small ' say he
i repeat it as i have tell it before
'it ring true eh '
say he
'it's good enough to act upon '
captain morstan nod
'look here small ' say the major
'we have be talk it over my friend here and i and we have come to the conclusion that this secret of yours be hardly a government matter after all but be a private concern of your own which of course you have the power of dispose of as you think best
now the question be what price would you ask for it
we might be incline to take it up and at least look into it if we could agree as to term '
he try to speak in a cool careless way but his eye be shin with excitement and greed
'why as to that gentlemen ' i answer try also to be cool but feel as excite as he do 'there be only one bargain which a man in my position can make
i shall want you to help me to my freedom and to help my three companion to theirs
we shall then take you into partnership and give you a fifth share to divide between you '
'hum '
say he
'a fifth share
that be not very tempt '
'it would come to fifty thousand apiece ' say i
'but how can we gain your freedom
you know very well that you ask an impossibility '
'nothing of the sort ' i answer
'i have think it all out to the last detail
the only bar to our escape be that we can get no boat fit for the voyage and no provision to last us for so long a time
there be plenty of little yacht and yawl at calcutta or madras which would serve our turn well
do you bring one over
we shall engage to get aboard her by night and if you will drop us on any part of the indian coast you will have do your part of the bargain '
'if there be only one ' he say
'none or all ' i answer
'we have swear it
the four of us must always act together '
'you see morstan ' say he 'small be a man of his word
he do not flinch from his friend
i think we may very well trust him '
'it's a dirty business ' the other answer
'yet as you say the money would save our commission handsomely '
'well small ' say the major 'we must i suppose try and meet you
we must first of course test the truth of your story
tell me where the box be hide and i shall get leave of absence and go back to india in the monthly relief boat to inquire into the affair '
'not so fast ' say i grow colder as he get hot
'i must have the consent of my three comrades
i tell you that it be four or none with us '
'nonsense '
he break in
'what have three black fellows to do with our agreement '
'black or blue ' say i 'they be in with me and we all go together '
well the matter end by a second meet at which mahomet singh abdullah khan and dost akbar be all present
we talk the matter over again and at last we come to an arrangement
we be to provide both the officer with chart of the part of the agra fort and mark the place in the wall where the treasure be hide
major sholto be to go to india to test our story
if he find the box he be to leave it there to send out a small yacht provision for a voyage which be to lie off rutland island and to which we be to make our way and finally to return to his duties
captain morstan be then to apply for leave of absence to meet us at agra and there we be to have a final division of the treasure he take the major's share as well as his own
all this we seal by the most solemn oaths that the mind could think or the lips utter
i sit up all night with paper and ink and by the morning i have the two chart all ready sign with the sign of four that be of abdullah akbar mahomet and myself
well gentlemen i weary you with my long story and i know that my friend mr
jones be impatient to get me safely stow in chokey
i'll make it as short as i can
the villain sholto go off to india but he never come back again
captain morstan show me his name among a list of passengers in one of the mail boat very shortly afterwards
his uncle have die leave him a fortune and he have leave the army yet he could stoop to treat five men as he have treat us
morstan go over to agra shortly afterwards and find as we expect that the treasure be indeed go
the scoundrel have steal it all without carry out one of the condition on which we have sell him the secret
from that day i live only for vengeance
i think of it by day and i nurse it by night
it become an overpower absorb passion with me
i care nothing for the law nothing for the gallows
to escape to track down sholto to have my hand upon his throat that be my one think
even the agra treasure have come to be a smaller thing in my mind than the slay of sholto
well i have set my mind on many things in this life and never one which i do not carry out
but it be weary years before my time come
i have tell you that i have pick up something of medicine
one day when dr
somerton be down with a fever a little andaman islander be pick up by a convict gang in the woods
he be sick to death and have go to a lonely place to die
i take him in hand though he be as venomous as a young snake and after a couple of months i get him all right and able to walk
he take a kind of fancy to me then and would hardly go back to his woods but be always hang about my hut
i learn a little of his lingo from him and this make him all the fonder of me
tonga for that be his name be a fine boatman and own a big roomy canoe of his own
when i find that he be devote to me and would do anything to serve me i saw my chance of escape
i talk it over with him
he be to bring his boat round on a certain night to an old wharf which be never guard and there he be to pick me up
i give him directions to have several gourds of water and a lot of yams cocoa nut and sweet potatoes
he be stanch and true be little tonga
no man ever have a more faithful mate
at the night name he have his boat at the wharf
as it chance however there be one of the convict guard down there a vile pathan who have never miss a chance of insult and injure me
i have always vow vengeance and now i have my chance
it be as if fate have place him in my way that i might pay my debt before i leave the island
he stand on the bank with his back to me and his carbine on his shoulder
i look about for a stone to beat out his brain with but none could i see
then a queer think come into my head and show me where i could lay my hand on a weapon
i sit down in the darkness and unstrapped my wooden leg
with three long hop i be on him
he put his carbine to his shoulder but i strike him full and knock the whole front of his skull in
you can see the split in the wood now where i hit him
we both go down together for i could not keep my balance but when i get up i find him still lie quiet enough
i make for the boat and in an hour we be well out at sea
tonga have bring all his earthly possessions with him his arm and his gods
among other things he have a long bamboo spear and some andaman cocoa nut mat with which i make a sort of sail
for ten days we be beat about trust to luck and on the eleventh we be pick up by a trader which be go from singapore to jiddah with a cargo of malay pilgrims
they be a rum crowd and tonga and i soon manage to settle down among them
they have one very good quality they let you alone and ask no question
well if i be to tell you all the adventure that my little chum and i go through you would not thank me for i would have you here until the sun be shin
here and there we drift about the world something always turn up to keep us from london
all the time however i never lose sight of my purpose
i would dream of sholto at night
a hundred time i have kill him in my sleep
at last however some three or four years ago we find ourselves in england
i have no great difficulty in find where sholto live and i set to work to discover whether he have realize the treasure or if he still have it
i make friends with someone who could help me i name no name for i don't want to get any one else in a hole and i soon find that he still have the jewel
then i try to get at him in many ways but he be pretty sly and have always two prize fighters besides his sons and his khitmutgar on guard over him
one day however i get word that he be die
i hurry at once to the garden mad that he should slip out of my clutch like that and look through the window i saw him lie in his bed with his sons on each side of him
i'd have come through and take my chance with the three of them only even as i look at him his jaw drop and i know that he be go
i get into his room that same night though and i search his paper to see if there be any record of where he have hide our jewel
there be not a line however so i come away bitter and savage as a man could be
before i leave i bethink me that if i ever meet my sikh friends again it would be a satisfaction to know that i have leave some mark of our hatred so i scrawl down the sign of the four of us as it have be on the chart and i pin it on his bosom
it be too much that he should be take to the grave without some token from the men whom he have rob and befool
we earn a live at this time by my exhibit poor tonga at fair and other such place as the black cannibal
he would eat raw meat and dance his war dance so we always have a hatful of pennies after a day's work
i still hear all the news from pondicherry lodge and for some years there be no news to hear except that they be hunt for the treasure
at last however come what we have wait for so long
the treasure have be find
it be up at the top of the house in mr
bartholomew sholto's chemical laboratory
i come at once and have a look at the place but i could not see how with my wooden leg i be to make my way up to it
i learn however about a trap door in the roof and also about mr
sholto's supper hour
it seem to me that i could manage the thing easily through tonga
i bring him out with me with a long rope wind round his waist
he could climb like a cat and he soon make his way through the roof but as ill luck would have it bartholomew sholto be still in the room to his cost
tonga think he have do something very clever in kill him for when i come up by the rope i find him strut about as proud as a peacock
very much surprise be he when i make at him with the rope's end and curse him for a little blood thirsty imp
i take the treasure box and let it down and then slide down myself have first leave the sign of the four upon the table to show that the jewel have come back at last to those who have most right to them
tonga then pull up the rope close the window and make off the way that he have come
i don't know that i have anything else to tell you
i have hear a waterman speak of the speed of smith's launch the aurora so i think she would be a handy craft for our escape
i engage with old smith and be to give him a big sum if he get us safe to our ship
he know no doubt that there be some screw loose but he be not in our secrets
all this be the truth and if i tell it to you gentlemen it be not to amuse you for you have not do me a very good turn but it be because i believe the best defence i can make be just to hold back nothing but let all the world know how badly i have myself be serve by major sholto and how innocent i be of the death of his son
a very remarkable account say sherlock holmes
a fit wind up to an extremely interest case
there be nothing at all new to me in the latter part of your narrative except that you bring your own rope
that i do not know
by the way i have hop that tonga have lose all his dart yet he manage to shoot one at us in the boat
he have lose them all sir except the one which be in his blow pipe at the time
ah of course say holmes
i have not think of that
be there any other point which you would like to ask about
ask the convict affably
i think not thank you my companion answer
well holmes say athelney jones you be a man to be humor and we all know that you be a connoisseur of crime but duty be duty and i have go rather far in do what you and your friend ask me
i shall feel more at ease when we have our story teller here safe under lock and key
the cab still wait and there be two inspectors down stairs
i be much oblige to you both for your assistance
of course you will be want at the trial
good night to you
good night gentlemen both say jonathan small
you first small remark the wary jones as they leave the room
i'll take particular care that you don't club me with your wooden leg whatever you may have do to the gentleman at the andaman isles
well and there be the end of our little drama i remark after we have set some time smoke in silence
i fear that it may be the last investigation in which i shall have the chance of study your methods
miss morstan have do me the honor to accept me as a husband in prospective
he give a most dismal groan
i fear as much say he
i really cannot congratulate you
i be a little hurt
have you any reason to be dissatisfy with my choice
i ask
not at all
i think she be one of the most charm young ladies i ever meet and might have be most useful in such work as we have be do
she have a decide genius that way witness the way in which she preserve that agra plan from all the other paper of her father
but love be an emotional thing and whatever be emotional be oppose to that true cold reason which i place above all things
i should never marry myself lest i bias my judgment
i trust say i laugh that my judgment may survive the ordeal
but you look weary
yes the reaction be already upon me
i shall be as limp as a rag for a week
strange say i how term of what in another man i should call laziness alternate with your fit of splendid energy and vigor
yes he answer there be in me the make of a very fine loafer and also of a pretty spry sort of fellow
i often think of those line of old goethe schade dass die natur nur einen mensch aus dir schuf denn zum wuerdigen mann war und zum schelmen der stoff
by the way a propos of this norwood business you see that they have as i surmise a confederate in the house who could be none other than lal rao the butler so jones actually have the undivided honor of have catch one fish in his great haul
the division seem rather unfair i remark
you have do all the work in this business
i get a wife out of it jones get the credit pray what remain for you
for me say sherlock holmes there still remain the cocaine bottle
and he stretch his long white hand up for it
mr
sherlock holmes who be usually very late in the mornings save upon those not infrequent occasion when he be up all night be seat at the breakfast table
i stand upon the hearth rug and pick up the stick which our visitor have leave behind him the night before
it be a fine thick piece of wood bulbous head of the sort which be know as a penang lawyer
just under the head be a broad silver band nearly an inch across
to jam mortimer m r c s from his friends of the c c h be engrave upon it with the date
it be just such a stick as the old fashion family practitioner use to carry dignify solid and reassure
well watson what do you make of it
holmes be sit with his back to me and i have give him no sign of my occupation
how do you know what i be do
i believe you have eye in the back of your head
i have at least a well polish silver plat coffee pot in front of me say he
but tell me watson what do you make of our visitor's stick
since we have be so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion of his errand this accidental souvenir become of importance
let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it
i think say i follow as far as i could the methods of my companion that dr
mortimer be a successful elderly medical man well esteem since those who know him give him this mark of their appreciation
good
say holmes
excellent
i think also that the probability be in favour of his be a country practitioner who do a great deal of his visit on foot
why so
because this stick though originally a very handsome one have be so knock about that i can hardly imagine a town practitioner carry it
the thick iron ferrule be wear down so it be evident that he have do a great amount of walk with it
perfectly sound
say holmes
and then again there be the 'friends of the c c h '
i should guess that to be the something hunt the local hunt to whose members he have possibly give some surgical assistance and which have make him a small presentation in return
really watson you excel yourself say holmes push back his chair and light a cigarette
i be bind to say that in all the account which you have be so good as to give of my own small achievements you have habitually underrate your own abilities
it may be that you be not yourself luminous but you be a conductor of light
some people without possess genius have a remarkable power of stimulate it
i confess my dear fellow that i be very much in your debt
he have never say as much before and i must admit that his word give me keen pleasure for i have often be pique by his indifference to my admiration and to the attempt which i have make to give publicity to his methods
i be proud too to think that i have so far master his system as to apply it in a way which earn his approval
he now take the stick from my hand and examine it for a few minutes with his naked eye
then with an expression of interest he lay down his cigarette and carry the cane to the window he look over it again with a convex lens
interest though elementary say he as he return to his favourite corner of the settee
there be certainly one or two indications upon the stick
it give us the basis for several deductions
have anything escape me
i ask with some self importance
i trust that there be nothing of consequence which i have overlook
i be afraid my dear watson that most of your conclusions be erroneous
when i say that you stimulate me i mean to be frank that in note your fallacies i be occasionally guide towards the truth
not that you be entirely wrong in this instance
the man be certainly a country practitioner
and he walk a good deal
then i be right
to that extent
but that be all
no no my dear watson not all by no mean all
i would suggest for example that a presentation to a doctor be more likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt and that when the initial 'c c '
be place before that hospital the word 'charing cross' very naturally suggest themselves
you may be right
the probability lie in that direction
and if we take this as a work hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of this unknown visitor
well then suppose that 'c c h '
do stand for 'charing cross hospital ' what further inferences may we draw
do none suggest themselves
you know my methods
apply them
i can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man have practise in town before go to the country
i think that we might venture a little farther than this
look at it in this light
on what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be make
when would his friends unite to give him a pledge of their good will
obviously at the moment when dr
mortimer withdraw from the service of the hospital in order to start a practice for himself
we know there have be a presentation
we believe there have be a change from a town hospital to a country practice
be it then stretch our inference too far to say that the presentation be on the occasion of the change
it certainly seem probable
now you will observe that he could not have be on the staff of the hospital since only a man well establish in a london practice could hold such a position and such a one would not drift into the country
what be he then
if he be in the hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have be a house surgeon or a house physician little more than a senior student
and he leave five years ago the date be on the stick
so your grave middle age family practitioner vanish into thin air my dear watson and there emerge a young fellow under thirty amiable unambitious absent mind and the possessor of a favourite dog which i should describe roughly as be larger than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff
i laugh incredulously as sherlock holmes lean back in his settee and blow little waver ring of smoke up to the ceiling
as to the latter part i have no mean of check you say i but at least it be not difficult to find out a few particulars about the man's age and professional career
from my small medical shelf i take down the medical directory and turn up the name
there be several mortimers but only one who could be our visitor
i read his record aloud
mortimer jam m r c s grimpen dartmoor devon
house surgeon from to at char cross hospital
winner of the jackson prize for comparative pathology with essay entitle 'is disease a reversion '
correspond member of the swedish pathological society
author of 'some freak of atavism' lancet
'do we progress '
journal of psychology march
medical officer for the parishes of grimpen thorsley and high barrow
no mention of that local hunt watson say holmes with a mischievous smile but a country doctor as you very astutely observe
i think that i be fairly justify in my inferences
as to the adjectives i say if i remember right amiable unambitious and absent mind
it be my experience that it be only an amiable man in this world who receive testimonials only an unambitious one who abandon a london career for the country and only an absent mind one who leave his stick and not his visit card after wait an hour in your room
and the dog
have be in the habit of carry this stick behind his master
be a heavy stick the dog have hold it tightly by the middle and the mark of his teeth be very plainly visible
the dog's jaw as show in the space between these mark be too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff
it may have be yes by jove it be a curly haired spaniel
he have rise and pace the room as he speak
now he halt in the recess of the window
there be such a ring of conviction in his voice that i glance up in surprise
my dear fellow how can you possibly be so sure of that
for the very simple reason that i see the dog himself on our very door step and there be the ring of its owner
don't move i beg you watson
he be a professional brother of yours and your presence may be of assistance to me
now be the dramatic moment of fate watson when you hear a step upon the stair which be walk into your life and you know not whether for good or ill
what do dr
jam mortimer the man of science ask of sherlock holmes the specialist in crime
come in
the appearance of our visitor be a surprise to me since i have expect a typical country practitioner
he be a very tall thin man with a long nose like a beak which jut out between two keen gray eye set closely together and sparkle brightly from behind a pair of gold rim glass
he be clothe in a professional but rather slovenly fashion for his frock coat be dingy and his trousers fray
though young his long back be already bow and he walk with a forward thrust of his head and a general air of peer benevolence
as he enter his eye fell upon the stick in holmes's hand and he run towards it with an exclamation of joy
i be so very glad say he
i be not sure whether i have leave it here or in the ship office
i would not lose that stick for the world
a presentation i see say holmes
yes sir
from char cross hospital
from one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage
dear dear that's bad
say holmes shake his head
dr
mortimer blink through his glass in mild astonishment
why be it bad
only that you have disarrange our little deductions
your marriage you say
yes sir
i marry and so leave the hospital and with it all hop of a consult practice
it be necessary to make a home of my own
come come we be not so far wrong after all say holmes
and now dr
jam mortimer mister sir mister a humble m r c s
and a man of precise mind evidently
a dabbler in science mr
holmes a picker up of shell on the shore of the great unknown ocean
i presume that it be mr
sherlock holmes whom i be address and not no this be my friend dr
watson
glad to meet you sir
i have hear your name mention in connection with that of your friend
you interest me very much mr
holmes
i have hardly expect so dolichocephalic a skull or such well mark supra orbital development
would you have any objection to my run my finger along your parietal fissure
a cast of your skull sir until the original be available would be an ornament to any anthropological museum
it be not my intention to be fulsome but i confess that i covet your skull
sherlock holmes wave our strange visitor into a chair
you be an enthusiast in your line of think i perceive sir as i be in mine say he
i observe from your forefinger that you make your own cigarettes
have no hesitation in light one
the man draw out paper and tobacco and twirl the one up in the other with surprise dexterity
he have long quiver finger as agile and restless as the antennae of an insect
holmes be silent but his little dart glance show me the interest which he take in our curious companion
i presume sir say he at last that it be not merely for the purpose of examine my skull that you have do me the honour to call here last night and again today
no sir no though i be happy to have have the opportunity of do that as well
i come to you mr
holmes because i recognize that i be myself an unpractical man and because i be suddenly confront with a most serious and extraordinary problem
recognize as i do that you be the second highest expert in europe indeed sir
may i inquire who have the honour to be the first
ask holmes with some asperity
to the man of precisely scientific mind the work of monsieur bertillon must always appeal strongly
then have you not better consult him
i say sir to the precisely scientific mind
but as a practical man of affairs it be acknowledge that you stand alone
i trust sir that i have not inadvertently just a little say holmes
i think dr
mortimer you would do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the exact nature of the problem be in which you demand my assistance
i have in my pocket a manuscript say dr
jam mortimer
i observe it as you enter the room say holmes
it be an old manuscript
early eighteenth century unless it be a forgery
how can you say that sir
you have present an inch or two of it to my examination all the time that you have be talk
it would be a poor expert who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so
you may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject
i put that at
the exact date be
dr
mortimer draw it from his breast pocket
this family paper be commit to my care by sir charles baskerville whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago create so much excitement in devonshire
i may say that i be his personal friend as well as his medical attendant
he be a strong mind man sir shrewd practical and as unimaginative as i be myself
yet he take this document very seriously and his mind be prepare for just such an end as do eventually overtake him
holmes stretch out his hand for the manuscript and flatten it upon his knee
you will observe watson the alternative use of the long s and the short
it be one of several indications which enable me to fix the date
i look over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the fade script
at the head be write baskerville hall and below in large scrawl figure
it appear to be a statement of some sort
yes it be a statement of a certain legend which run in the baskerville family
but i understand that it be something more modern and practical upon which you wish to consult me
most modern
a most practical press matter which must be decide within twenty four hours
but the manuscript be short and be intimately connect with the affair
with your permission i will read it to you
holmes lean back in his chair place his finger tip together and close his eye with an air of resignation
dr
mortimer turn the manuscript to the light and read in a high crack voice the follow curious old world narrative of the origin of the hound of the baskervilles there have be many statements yet as i come in a direct line from hugo baskerville and as i have the story from my father who also have it from his i have set it down with all belief that it occur even as be here set forth
and i would have you believe my sons that the same justice which punish sin may also most graciously forgive it and that no ban be so heavy but that by prayer and repentance it may be remove
learn then from this story not to fear the fruit of the past but rather to be circumspect in the future that those foul passions whereby our family have suffer so grievously may not again be loose to our undo
know then that in the time of the great rebellion the history of which by the learn lord clarendon i most earnestly commend to your attention this manor of baskerville be hold by hugo of that name nor can it be gainsay that he be a most wild profane and godless man
this in truth his neighbour might have pardon see that saint have never flourish in those part but there be in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which make his name a by word through the west
it chance that this hugo come to love if indeed so dark a passion may be know under so bright a name the daughter of a yeoman who hold land near the baskerville estate
but the young maiden be discreet and of good repute would ever avoid him for she fear his evil name
so it come to pass that one michaelmas this hugo with five or six of his idle and wicked companion steal down upon the farm and carry off the maiden her father and brothers be from home as he well know
when they have bring her to the hall the maiden be place in an upper chamber while hugo and his friends sit down to a long carouse as be their nightly custom
now the poor lass upstairs be like to have her wits turn at the sing and shout and terrible oaths which come up to her from below for they say that the word use by hugo baskerville when he be in wine be such as might blast the man who say them
at last in the stress of her fear she do that which might have daunt the bravest or most active man for by the aid of the growth of ivy which cover and still cover the south wall she come down from under the eaves and so homeward across the moor there be three league betwixt the hall and her father's farm
it chance that some little time later hugo leave his guests to carry food and drink with other worse things perchance to his captive and so find the cage empty and the bird escape
then as it would seem he become as one that hath a devil for rush down the stairs into the din hall he spring upon the great table flagons and trenchers fly before him and he cry aloud before all the company that he would that very night render his body and soul to the power of evil if he might but overtake the wench
and while the revellers stand aghast at the fury of the man one more wicked or it may be more drunken than the rest cry out that they should put the hound upon her
whereat hugo run from the house cry to his groom that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack and give the hound a kerchief of the maid's he swing them to the line and so off full cry in the moonlight over the moor
now for some space the revellers stand agape unable to understand all that have be do in such haste
but anon their bemuse wits awake to the nature of the deed which be like to be do upon the moorlands
everything be now in an uproar some call for their pistols some for their horse and some for another flask of wine
but at length some sense come back to their craze mind and the whole of them thirteen in number take horse and start in pursuit
the moon shine clear above them and they ride swiftly abreast take that course which the maid must need have take if she be to reach her own home
they have go a mile or two when they pass one of the night shepherd upon the moorlands and they cry to him to know if he have see the hunt
and the man as the story go be so craze with fear that he could scarce speak but at last he say that he have indeed see the unhappy maiden with the hound upon her track
'but i have see more than that ' say he 'for hugo baskerville pass me upon his black mare and there run mute behind him such a hound of hell as god forbid should ever be at my heel '
so the drunken squire curse the shepherd and ride onward
but soon their skin turn cold for there come a gallop across the moor and the black mare dabble with white froth go past with trail bridle and empty saddle
then the revellers ride close together for a great fear be on them but they still follow over the moor though each have he be alone would have be right glad to have turn his horse's head
rid slowly in this fashion they come at last upon the hound
these though know for their valour and their breed be whimper in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal as we call it upon the moor some slink away and some with start hackle and star eye gaze down the narrow valley before them
the company have come to a halt more sober men as you may guess than when they start
the most of them would by no mean advance but three of them the boldest or it may be the most drunken ride forward down the goyal
now it open into a broad space in which stand two of those great stone still to be see there which be set by certain forget people in the days of old
the moon be shin bright upon the clear and there in the centre lay the unhappy maid where she have fall dead of fear and of fatigue
but it be not the sight of her body nor yet be it that of the body of hugo baskerville lie near her which raise the hair upon the head of these three dare devil roysterers but it be that stand over hugo and pluck at his throat there stand a foul thing a great black beast shape like a hound yet larger than any hound that ever mortal eye have rest upon
and even as they look the thing tear the throat out of hugo baskerville on which as it turn its blaze eye and drip jaw upon them the three shriek with fear and ride for dear life still scream across the moor
one it be say die that very night of what he have see and the other twain be but break men for the rest of their days
such be the tale my sons of the come of the hound which be say to have plague the family so sorely ever since
if i have set it down it be because that which be clearly know hath less terror than that which be but hint at and guess
nor can it be deny that many of the family have be unhappy in their deaths which have be sudden bloody and mysterious
yet may we shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of providence which would not forever punish the innocent beyond that third or fourth generation which be threaten in holy writ
to that providence my sons i hereby commend you and i counsel you by way of caution to forbear from cross the moor in those dark hours when the power of evil be exalt
this from hugo baskerville to his sons rodger and john with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their sister elizabeth
when dr
mortimer have finish read this singular narrative he push his spectacles up on his forehead and star across at mr
sherlock holmes
the latter yawn and toss the end of his cigarette into the fire
well
say he
do you not find it interest
to a collector of fairy tales
dr
mortimer draw a fold newspaper out of his pocket
now mr
holmes we will give you something a little more recent
this be the devon county chronicle of may 14th of this year
it be a short account of the facts elicit at the death of sir charles baskerville which occur a few days before that date
my friend lean a little forward and his expression become intent
our visitor readjust his glass and begin the recent sudden death of sir charles baskerville whose name have be mention as the probable liberal candidate for mid devon at the next election have cast a gloom over the county
though sir charles have reside at baskerville hall for a comparatively short period his amiability of character and extreme generosity have win the affection and respect of all who have be bring into contact with him
in these days of nouveaux riches it be refresh to find a case where the scion of an old county family which have fall upon evil days be able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him to restore the fall grandeur of his line
sir charles as be well know make large sum of money in south african speculation
more wise than those who go on until the wheel turn against them he realize his gain and return to england with them
it be only two years since he take up his residence at baskerville hall and it be common talk how large be those scheme of reconstruction and improvement which have be interrupt by his death
be himself childless it be his openly express desire that the whole countryside should within his own lifetime profit by his good fortune and many will have personal reason for bewail his untimely end
his generous donations to local and county charities have be frequently chronicle in these columns
the circumstances connect with the death of sir charles cannot be say to have be entirely clear up by the inquest but at least enough have be do to dispose of those rumour to which local superstition have give rise
there be no reason whatever to suspect foul play or to imagine that death could be from any but natural cause
sir charles be a widower and a man who may be say to have be in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind
in spite of his considerable wealth he be simple in his personal taste and his indoor servants at baskerville hall consist of a marry couple name barrymore the husband act as butler and the wife as housekeeper
their evidence corroborate by that of several friends tend to show that sir charles's health have for some time be impair and point especially to some affection of the heart manifest itself in change of colour breathlessness and acute attack of nervous depression
dr
jam mortimer the friend and medical attendant of the decease have give evidence to the same effect
the facts of the case be simple
sir charles baskerville be in the habit every night before go to bed of walk down the famous yew alley of baskerville hall
the evidence of the barrymores show that this have be his custom
on the fourth of may sir charles have declare his intention of start next day for london and have order barrymore to prepare his luggage
that night he go out as usual for his nocturnal walk in the course of which he be in the habit of smoke a cigar
he never return
at twelve o'clock barrymore find the hall door still open become alarm and light a lantern go in search of his master
the day have be wet and sir charles's footmarks be easily trace down the alley
halfway down this walk there be a gate which lead out on to the moor
there be indications that sir charles have stand for some little time here
he then proceed down the alley and it be at the far end of it that his body be discover
one fact which have not be explain be the statement of barrymore that his master's footprints alter their character from the time that he pass the moor gate and that he appear from thence onward to have be walk upon his toe
one murphy a gipsy horse dealer be on the moor at no great distance at the time but he appear by his own confession to have be the worse for drink
he declare that he hear cry but be unable to state from what direction they come
no sign of violence be to be discover upon sir charles's person and though the doctor's evidence point to an almost incredible facial distortion so great that dr
mortimer refuse at first to believe that it be indeed his friend and patient who lay before him it be explain that that be a symptom which be not unusual in case of dyspnoea and death from cardiac exhaustion
this explanation be bear out by the post mortem examination which show long stand organic disease and the coroner's jury return a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence
it be well that this be so for it be obviously of the utmost importance that sir charles's heir should settle at the hall and continue the good work which have be so sadly interrupt
have the prosaic find of the coroner not finally put an end to the romantic stories which have be whisper in connection with the affair it might have be difficult to find a tenant for baskerville hall
it be understand that the next of kin be mr
henry baskerville if he be still alive the son of sir charles baskerville's younger brother
the young man when last hear of be in america and inquiries be be institute with a view to inform him of his good fortune
dr
mortimer refolded his paper and replace it in his pocket
those be the public facts mr
holmes in connection with the death of sir charles baskerville
i must thank you say sherlock holmes for call my attention to a case which certainly present some feature of interest
i have observe some newspaper comment at the time but i be exceedingly preoccupy by that little affair of the vatican cameos and in my anxiety to oblige the pope i lose touch with several interest english case
this article you say contain all the public facts
it do
then let me have the private ones
he lean back put his finger tip together and assume his most impassive and judicial expression
in do so say dr
mortimer who have begin to show sign of some strong emotion i be tell that which i have not confide to anyone
my motive for withhold it from the coroner's inquiry be that a man of science shrink from place himself in the public position of seem to indorse a popular superstition
i have the further motive that baskerville hall as the paper say would certainly remain untenanted if anything be do to increase its already rather grim reputation
for both these reason i think that i be justify in tell rather less than i know since no practical good could result from it but with you there be no reason why i should not be perfectly frank
the moor be very sparsely inhabit and those who live near each other be throw very much together
for this reason i saw a good deal of sir charles baskerville
with the exception of mr
frankland of lafter hall and mr
stapleton the naturalist there be no other men of education within many miles
sir charles be a retire man but the chance of his illness bring us together and a community of interest in science keep us so
he have bring back much scientific information from south africa and many a charm even we have spend together discuss the comparative anatomy of the bushman and the hottentot
within the last few months it become increasingly plain to me that sir charles's nervous system be strain to the break point
he have take this legend which i have read you exceedingly to heart so much so that although he would walk in his own ground nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at night
incredible as it may appear to you mr
holmes he be honestly convince that a dreadful fate overhang his family and certainly the record which he be able to give of his ancestors be not encourage
the idea of some ghastly presence constantly haunt him and on more than one occasion he have ask me whether i have on my medical journey at night ever see any strange creature or hear the bay of a hound
the latter question he put to me several time and always with a voice which vibrate with excitement
i can well remember drive up to his house in the even some three weeks before the fatal event
he chance to be at his hall door
i have descend from my gig and be stand in front of him when i saw his eye fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror
i whisk round and have just time to catch a glimpse of something which i take to be a large black calf pass at the head of the drive
so excite and alarm be he that i be compel to go down to the spot where the animal have be and look around for it
it be go however and the incident appear to make the worst impression upon his mind
i stay with him all the even and it be on that occasion to explain the emotion which he have show that he confide to my keep that narrative which i read to you when first i come
i mention this small episode because it assume some importance in view of the tragedy which follow but i be convince at the time that the matter be entirely trivial and that his excitement have no justification
it be at my advice that sir charles be about to go to london
his heart be i know affect and the constant anxiety in which he live however chimerical the cause of it might be be evidently have a serious effect upon his health
i think that a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a new man
mr
stapleton a mutual friend who be much concern at his state of health be of the same opinion
at the last instant come this terrible catastrophe
on the night of sir charles's death barrymore the butler who make the discovery send perkins the groom on horseback to me and as i be sit up late i be able to reach baskerville hall within an hour of the event
i check and corroborate all the facts which be mention at the inquest
i follow the footsteps down the yew alley i saw the spot at the moor gate where he seem to have wait i remark the change in the shape of the print after that point i note that there be no other footsteps save those of barrymore on the soft gravel and finally i carefully examine the body which have not be touch until my arrival
sir charles lay on his face his arm out his finger dig into the grind and his feature convulse with some strong emotion to such an extent that i could hardly have swear to his identity
there be certainly no physical injury of any kind
but one false statement be make by barrymore at the inquest
he say that there be no trace upon the grind round the body
he do not observe any
but i do some little distance off but fresh and clear
footprints
footprints
a man's or a woman's
dr
mortimer look strangely at us for an instant and his voice sink almost to a whisper as he answer
mr
holmes they be the footprints of a gigantic hound
i confess at these word a shudder pass through me
there be a thrill in the doctor's voice which show that he be himself deeply move by that which he tell us
holmes lean forward in his excitement and his eye have the hard dry glitter which shoot from them when he be keenly interest
you saw this
as clearly as i see you
and you say nothing
what be the use
how be it that no one else saw it
the mark be some twenty yards from the body and no one give them a think
i don't suppose i should have do so have i not know this legend
there be many sheep dog on the moor
no doubt but this be no sheep dog
you say it be large
enormous
but it have not approach the body
no
what sort of night be it '
damp and raw
but not actually rain
no
what be the alley like
there be two line of old yew hedge twelve feet high and impenetrable
the walk in the centre be about eight feet across
be there anything between the hedge and the walk
yes there be a strip of grass about six feet broad on either side
i understand that the yew hedge be penetrate at one point by a gate
yes the wicket gate which lead on to the moor
be there any other open
none
so that to reach the yew alley one either have to come down it from the house or else to enter it by the moor gate
there be an exit through a summer house at the far end
have sir charles reach this
no he lay about fifty yards from it
now tell me dr
mortimer and this be important the mark which you saw be on the path and not on the grass
no mark could show on the grass
be they on the same side of the path as the moor gate
yes they be on the edge of the path on the same side as the moor gate
you interest me exceedingly
another point
be the wicket gate close
close and padlock
how high be it
about four feet high
then anyone could have get over it
yes
and what mark do you see by the wicket gate
none in particular
good heaven
do no one examine
yes i examine myself
and find nothing
it be all very confuse
sir charles have evidently stand there for five or ten minutes
how do you know that
because the ash have twice drop from his cigar
excellent
this be a colleague watson after our own heart
but the mark
he have leave his own mark all over that small patch of gravel
i could discern no others
sherlock holmes strike his hand against his knee with an impatient gesture
if i have only be there
he cry
it be evidently a case of extraordinary interest and one which present immense opportunities to the scientific expert
that gravel page upon which i might have read so much have be long ere this smudge by the rain and deface by the clog of curious peasants
oh dr
mortimer dr
mortimer to think that you should not have call me in
you have indeed much to answer for
i could not call you in mr
holmes without disclose these facts to the world and i have already give my reason for not wish to do so
besides besides why do you hesitate
there be a realm in which the most acute and most experience of detectives be helpless
you mean that the thing be supernatural
i do not positively say so
no but you evidently think it
since the tragedy mr
holmes there have come to my ears several incidents which be hard to reconcile with the settle order of nature
for example
i find that before the terrible event occur several people have see a creature upon the moor which correspond with this baskerville demon and which could not possibly be any animal know to science
they all agree that it be a huge creature luminous ghastly and spectral
i have cross examine these men one of them a hard head countryman one a farrier and one a moorland farmer who all tell the same story of this dreadful apparition exactly correspond to the hell hound of the legend
i assure you that there be a reign of terror in the district and that it be a hardy man who will cross the moor at night
and you a train man of science believe it to be supernatural
i do not know what to believe
holmes shrug his shoulder
i have hitherto confine my investigations to this world say he
in a modest way i have combat evil but to take on the father of evil himself would perhaps be too ambitious a task
yet you must admit that the footmark be material
the original hound be material enough to tug a man's throat out and yet he be diabolical as well
i see that you have quite go over to the supernaturalists
but now dr
mortimer tell me this
if you hold these view why have you come to consult me at all
you tell me in the same breath that it be useless to investigate sir charles's death and that you desire me to do it
i do not say that i desire you to do it
then how can i assist you
by advise me as to what i should do with sir henry baskerville who arrive at waterloo station dr
mortimer look at his watch in exactly one hour and a quarter
he be the heir
yes
on the death of sir charles we inquire for this young gentleman and find that he have be farm in canada
from the account which have reach us he be an excellent fellow in every way
i speak now not as a medical man but as a trustee and executor of sir charles's will
there be no other claimant i presume
none
the only other kinsman whom we have be able to trace be rodger baskerville the youngest of three brothers of whom poor sir charles be the elder
the second brother who die young be the father of this lad henry
the third rodger be the black sheep of the family
he come of the old masterful baskerville strain and be the very image they tell me of the family picture of old hugo
he make england too hot to hold him flee to central america and die there in of yellow fever
henry be the last of the baskervilles
in one hour and five minutes i meet him at waterloo station
i have have a wire that he arrive at southampton this morning
now mr
holmes what would you advise me to do with him
why should he not go to the home of his father
it seem natural do it not
and yet consider that every baskerville who go there meet with an evil fate
i feel sure that if sir charles could have speak with me before his death he would have warn me against bring this the last of the old race and the heir to great wealth to that deadly place
and yet it cannot be deny that the prosperity of the whole poor bleak countryside depend upon his presence
all the good work which have be do by sir charles will crash to the grind if there be no tenant of the hall
i fear lest i should be sway too much by my own obvious interest in the matter and that be why i bring the case before you and ask for your advice
holmes consider for a little time
put into plain word the matter be this say he
in your opinion there be a diabolical agency which make dartmoor an unsafe abide for a baskerville that be your opinion
at least i might go the length of say that there be some evidence that this may be so
exactly
but surely if your supernatural theory be correct it could work the young man evil in london as easily as in devonshire
a devil with merely local power like a parish vestry would be too inconceivable a thing
you put the matter more flippantly mr
holmes than you would probably do if you be bring into personal contact with these things
your advice then as i understand it be that the young man will be as safe in devonshire as in london
he come in fifty minutes
what would you recommend
i recommend sir that you take a cab call off your spaniel who be scratch at my front door and proceed to waterloo to meet sir henry baskerville
and then
and then you will say nothing to him at all until i have make up my mind about the matter
how long will it take you to make up your mind
twenty four hours
at ten o'clock tomorrow dr
mortimer i will be much oblige to you if you will call upon me here and it will be of help to me in my plan for the future if you will bring sir henry baskerville with you
i will do so mr
holmes
he scribble the appointment on his shirt cuff and hurry off in his strange peer absent mind fashion
holmes stop him at the head of the stair
only one more question dr
mortimer
you say that before sir charles baskerville's death several people saw this apparition upon the moor
three people do
do any see it after
i have not hear of any
thank you
good morning
holmes return to his seat with that quiet look of inward satisfaction which mean that he have a congenial task before him
go out watson
unless i can help you
no my dear fellow it be at the hour of action that i turn to you for aid
but this be splendid really unique from some point of view
when you pass bradley's would you ask him to send up a pound of the strongest shag tobacco
thank you
it would be as well if you could make it convenient not to return before even
then i should be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interest problem which have be submit to us this morning
i know that seclusion and solitude be very necessary for my friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he weigh every particle of evidence construct alternative theories balance one against the other and make up his mind as to which point be essential and which immaterial
i therefore spend the day at my club and do not return to baker street until even
it be nearly nine o'clock when i find myself in the sit room once more
my first impression as i open the door be that a fire have break out for the room be so fill with smoke that the light of the lamp upon the table be blur by it
as i enter however my fear be set at rest for it be the acrid fume of strong coarse tobacco which take me by the throat and set me cough
through the haze i have a vague vision of holmes in his dress gown coil up in an armchair with his black clay pipe between his lips
several roll of paper lay around him
catch cold watson
say he
no it's this poisonous atmosphere
i suppose it be pretty thick now that you mention it
thick
it be intolerable
open the window then
you have be at your club all day i perceive
my dear holmes
be i right
certainly but how
he laugh at my bewilder expression
there be a delightful freshness about you watson which make it a pleasure to exercise any small power which i possess at your expense
a gentleman go forth on a showery and miry day
he return immaculate in the even with the gloss still on his hat and his boot
he have be a fixture therefore all day
he be not a man with intimate friends
where then could he have be
be it not obvious
well it be rather obvious
the world be full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observe
where do you think that i have be
a fixture also
on the contrary i have be to devonshire
in spirit
exactly
my body have remain in this armchair and have i regret to observe consume in my absence two large pot of coffee and an incredible amount of tobacco
after you leave i send down to stamford's for the ordnance map of this portion of the moor and my spirit have hover over it all day
i flatter myself that i could find my way about
a large scale map i presume
very large
he unroll one section and hold it over his knee
here you have the particular district which concern us
that be baskerville hall in the middle
with a wood round it
exactly
i fancy the yew alley though not mark under that name must stretch along this line with the moor as you perceive upon the right of it
this small clump of build here be the hamlet of grimpen where our friend dr
mortimer have his headquarter
within a radius of five miles there be as you see only a very few scatter dwell
here be lafter hall which be mention in the narrative
there be a house indicate here which may be the residence of the naturalist stapleton if i remember right be his name
here be two moorland farmhouses high tor and foulmire
then fourteen miles away the great convict prison of princetown
between and around these scatter point extend the desolate lifeless moor
this then be the stage upon which tragedy have be play and upon which we may help to play it again
it must be a wild place
yes the set be a worthy one
if the devil do desire to have a hand in the affairs of men then you be yourself incline to the supernatural explanation
the devil's agents may be of flesh and blood may they not
there be two question wait for us at the outset
the one be whether any crime have be commit at all the second be what be the crime and how be it commit
of course if dr
mortimer's surmise should be correct and we be deal with force outside the ordinary laws of nature there be an end of our investigation
but we be bind to exhaust all other hypotheses before fall back upon this one
i think we'll shut that window again if you don't mind
it be a singular thing but i find that a concentrate atmosphere help a concentration of think
i have not push it to the length of get into a box to think but that be the logical outcome of my convictions
have you turn the case over in your mind
yes i have think a good deal of it in the course of the day
what do you make of it
it be very bewilder
it have certainly a character of its own
there be point of distinction about it
that change in the footprints for example
what do you make of that
mortimer say that the man have walk on tiptoe down that portion of the alley
he only repeat what some fool have say at the inquest
why should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley
what then
he be run watson run desperately run for his life run until he burst his heart and fell dead upon his face
run from what
there lie our problem
there be indications that the man be craze with fear before ever he begin to run
how can you say that
i be presume that the cause of his fear come to him across the moor
if that be so and it seem most probable only a man who have lose his wits would have run from the house instead of towards it
if the gipsy's evidence may be take as true he run with cry for help in the direction where help be least likely to be
then again whom be he wait for that night and why be he wait for him in the yew alley rather than in his own house
you think that he be wait for someone
the man be elderly and infirm
we can understand his take an even stroll but the grind be damp and the night inclement
be it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes as dr
mortimer with more practical sense than i should have give him credit for deduce from the cigar ash
but he go out every even
i think it unlikely that he wait at the moor gate every even
on the contrary the evidence be that he avoid the moor
that night he wait there
it be the night before he make his departure for london
the thing take shape watson
it become coherent
might i ask you to hand me my violin and we will postpone all further think upon this business until we have have the advantage of meet dr
mortimer and sir henry baskerville in the morning
our breakfast table be clear early and holmes wait in his dress gown for the promise interview
our clients be punctual to their appointment for the clock have just strike ten when dr
mortimer be show up follow by the young baronet
the latter be a small alert dark eye man about thirty years of age very sturdily build with thick black eyebrows and a strong pugnacious face
he wear a ruddy tint tweed suit and have the weather beat appearance of one who have spend most of his time in the open air and yet there be something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bear which indicate the gentleman
this be sir henry baskerville say dr
mortimer
why yes say he and the strange thing be mr
sherlock holmes that if my friend here have not propose come round to you this morning i should have come on my own account
i understand that you think out little puzzle and i've have one this morning which want more think out than i be able to give it
pray take a seat sir henry
do i understand you to say that you have yourself have some remarkable experience since you arrive in london
nothing of much importance mr
holmes
only a joke as like as not
it be this letter if you can call it a letter which reach me this morning
he lay an envelope upon the table and we all bend over it
it be of common quality grayish in colour
the address sir henry baskerville northumberland hotel be print in rough character the post mark char cross and the date of post the precede even
who know that you be go to the northumberland hotel
ask holmes glance keenly across at our visitor
no one could have know
we only decide after i meet dr
mortimer
but dr
mortimer be no doubt already stop there
no i have be stay with a friend say the doctor
there be no possible indication that we intend to go to this hotel
hum
someone seem to be very deeply interest in your movements
out of the envelope he take a half sheet of foolscap paper fold into four
this he open and spread flat upon the table
across the middle of it a single sentence have be form by the expedient of paste print word upon it
it run as you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor
the word moor only be print in ink
now say sir henry baskerville perhaps you will tell me mr
holmes what in thunder be the mean of that and who it be that take so much interest in my affairs
what do you make of it dr
mortimer
you must allow that there be nothing supernatural about this at any rate
no sir but it might very well come from someone who be convince that the business be supernatural
what business
ask sir henry sharply
it seem to me that all you gentlemen know a great deal more than i do about my own affairs
you shall share our knowledge before you leave this room sir henry
i promise you that say sherlock holmes
we will confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this very interest document which must have be put together and post yesterday even
have you yesterday's time watson
it be here in the corner
might i trouble you for it the inside page please with the lead article
he glance swiftly over it run his eye up and down the columns
capital article this on free trade
permit me to give you an extract from it
'you may be cajole into imagine that your own special trade or your own industry will be encourage by a protective tariff but it stand to reason that such legislation must in the long run keep away wealth from the country diminish the value of our import and lower the general condition of life in this island '
what do you think of that watson
cry holmes in high glee rub his hand together with satisfaction
don't you think that be an admirable sentiment
dr
mortimer look at holmes with an air of professional interest and sir henry baskerville turn a pair of puzzle dark eye upon me
i don't know much about the tariff and things of that kind say he but it seem to me we've get a bite off the trail so far as that note be concern
on the contrary i think we be particularly hot upon the trail sir henry
watson here know more about my methods than you do but i fear that even he have not quite grasp the significance of this sentence
no i confess that i see no connection
and yet my dear watson there be so very close a connection that the one be extract out of the other
'you ' 'your ' 'your ' 'life ' 'reason ' 'value ' 'keep away ' 'from the '
don't you see now whence these word have be take
by thunder you're right
well if that isn't smart
cry sir henry
if any possible doubt remain it be settle by the fact that 'keep away' and 'from the' be cut out in one piece
well now so it be
really mr
holmes this exceed anything which i could have imagine say dr
mortimer gaze at my friend in amazement
i could understand anyone say that the word be from a newspaper but that you should name which and add that it come from the lead article be really one of the most remarkable things which i have ever know
how do you do it
i presume doctor that you could tell the skull of a negro from that of an esquimau
most certainly
but how
because that be my special hobby
the differences be obvious
the supra orbital crest the facial angle the maxillary curve the but this be my special hobby and the differences be equally obvious
there be as much difference to my eye between the lead bourgeois type of a time article and the slovenly print of an even half penny paper as there could be between your negro and your esquimau
the detection of type be one of the most elementary branch of knowledge to the special expert in crime though i confess that once when i be very young i confuse the leeds mercury with the western morning news
but a time leader be entirely distinctive and these word could have be take from nothing else
as it be do yesterday the strong probability be that we should find the word in yesterday's issue
so far as i can follow you then mr
holmes say sir henry baskerville someone cut out this message with a scissor nail scissor say holmes
you can see that it be a very short bladed scissor since the cutter have to take two snip over 'keep away '
that be so
someone then cut out the message with a pair of short bladed scissor paste it with paste gum say holmes
with gum on to the paper
but i want to know why the word 'moor' should have be write
because he could not find it in print
the other word be all simple and might be find in any issue but 'moor' would be less common
why of course that would explain it
have you read anything else in this message mr
holmes
there be one or two indications and yet the utmost pain have be take to remove all clue
the address you observe be print in rough character
but the time be a paper which be seldom find in any hand but those of the highly educate
we may take it therefore that the letter be compose by an educate man who wish to pose as an uneducated one and his effort to conceal his own write suggest that that write might be know or come to be know by you
again you will observe that the word be not gum on in an accurate line but that some be much higher than others
'life ' for example be quite out of its proper place
that may point to carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter
on the whole i incline to the latter view since the matter be evidently important and it be unlikely that the composer of such a letter would be careless
if he be in a hurry it open up the interest question why he should be in a hurry since any letter post up to early morning would reach sir henry before he would leave his hotel
do the composer fear an interruption and from whom
we be come now rather into the region of guesswork say dr
mortimer
say rather into the region where we balance probabilities and choose the most likely
it be the scientific use of the imagination but we have always some material basis on which to start our speculation
now you would call it a guess no doubt but i be almost certain that this address have be write in a hotel
how in the world can you say that
if you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the ink have give the writer trouble
the pen have splutter twice in a single word and have run dry three time in a short address show that there be very little ink in the bottle
now a private pen or ink bottle be seldom allow to be in such a state and the combination of the two must be quite rare
but you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen where it be rare to get anything else
yes i have very little hesitation in say that could we examine the waste paper baskets of the hotels around char cross until we find the remain of the mutilate time leader we could lay our hand straight upon the person who send this singular message
halloa
halloa
what's this
he be carefully examine the foolscap upon which the word be paste hold it only an inch or two from his eye
well
nothing say he throw it down
it be a blank half sheet of paper without even a water mark upon it
i think we have draw as much as we can from this curious letter and now sir henry have anything else of interest happen to you since you have be in london
why no mr
holmes
i think not
you have not observe anyone follow or watch you
i seem to have walk right into the thick of a dime novel say our visitor
why in thunder should anyone follow or watch me
we be come to that
you have nothing else to report to us before we go into this matter
well it depend upon what you think worth report
i think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth report
sir henry smile
i don't know much of british life yet for i have spend nearly all my time in the state and in canada
but i hope that to lose one of your boot be not part of the ordinary routine of life over here
you have lose one of your boot
my dear sir cry dr
mortimer it be only mislay
you will find it when you return to the hotel
what be the use of trouble mr
holmes with trifle of this kind
well he ask me for anything outside the ordinary routine
exactly say holmes however foolish the incident may seem
you have lose one of your boot you say
well mislay it anyhow
i put them both outside my door last night and there be only one in the morning
i could get no sense out of the chap who clean them
the worst of it be that i only buy the pair last night in the strand and i have never have them on
if you have never wear them why do you put them out to be clean
they be tan boot and have never be varnish
that be why i put them out
then i understand that on your arrival in london yesterday you go out at once and buy a pair of boot
i do a good deal of shop
dr
mortimer here go round with me
you see if i be to be squire down there i must dress the part and it may be that i have get a little careless in my ways out west
among other things i buy these brown boot give six dollars for them and have one steal before ever i have them on my feet
it seem a singularly useless thing to steal say sherlock holmes
i confess that i share dr
mortimer's belief that it will not be long before the miss boot be find
and now gentlemen say the baronet with decision it seem to me that i have speak quite enough about the little that i know
it be time that you keep your promise and give me a full account of what we be all drive at
your request be a very reasonable one holmes answer
dr
mortimer i think you could not do better than to tell your story as you tell it to us
thus encourage our scientific friend draw his paper from his pocket and present the whole case as he have do upon the morning before
sir henry baskerville listen with the deepest attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise
well i seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance say he when the long narrative be finish
of course i've hear of the hound ever since i be in the nursery
it's the pet story of the family though i never think of take it seriously before
but as to my uncle's death well it all seem boil up in my head and i can't get it clear yet
you don't seem quite to have make up your mind whether it's a case for a policeman or a clergyman
precisely
and now there's this affair of the letter to me at the hotel
i suppose that fit into its place
it seem to show that someone know more than we do about what go on upon the moor say dr
mortimer
and also say holmes that someone be not ill dispose towards you since they warn you of danger
or it may be that they wish for their own purpose to scare me away
well of course that be possible also
i be very much indebted to you dr
mortimer for introduce me to a problem which present several interest alternatives
but the practical point which we now have to decide sir henry be whether it be or be not advisable for you to go to baskerville hall
why should i not go
there seem to be danger
do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger from human be
well that be what we have to find out
whichever it be my answer be fix
there be no devil in hell mr
holmes and there be no man upon earth who can prevent me from go to the home of my own people and you may take that to be my final answer
his dark brows knit and his face flush to a dusky red as he speak
it be evident that the fiery temper of the baskervilles be not extinct in this their last representative
meanwhile say he i have hardly have time to think over all that you have tell me
it's a big thing for a man to have to understand and to decide at one sit
i should like to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind
now look here mr
holmes it's half past eleven now and i be go back right away to my hotel
suppose you and your friend dr
watson come round and lunch with us at two
i'll be able to tell you more clearly then how this thing strike me
be that convenient to you watson
perfectly
then you may expect us
shall i have a cab call
i'd prefer to walk for this affair have flurry me rather
i'll join you in a walk with pleasure say his companion
then we meet again at two o'clock
au revoir and good morning
we hear the step of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of the front door
in an instant holmes have change from the languid dreamer to the man of action
your hat and boot watson quick
not a moment to lose
he rush into his room in his dress gown and be back again in a few second in a frock coat
we hurry together down the stairs and into the street
dr
mortimer and baskerville be still visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of oxford street
shall i run on and stop them
not for the world my dear watson
i be perfectly satisfy with your company if you will tolerate mine
our friends be wise for it be certainly a very fine morning for a walk
he quicken his pace until we have decrease the distance which divide us by about half
then still keep a hundred yards behind we follow into oxford street and so down regent street
once our friends stop and star into a shop window upon which holmes do the same
an instant afterwards he give a little cry of satisfaction and follow the direction of his eager eye i saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which have halt on the other side of the street be now proceed slowly onward again
there's our man watson
come along
we'll have a good look at him if we can do no more
at that instant i be aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of pierce eye turn upon us through the side window of the cab
instantly the trapdoor at the top fly up something be scream to the driver and the cab fly madly off down regent street
holmes look eagerly round for another but no empty one be in sight
then he dash in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic but the start be too great and already the cab be out of sight
there now
say holmes bitterly as he emerge pant and white with vexation from the tide of vehicles
be ever such bad luck and such bad management too
watson watson if you be an honest man you will record this also and set it against my successes
who be the man
i have not an idea
a spy
well it be evident from what we have hear that baskerville have be very closely shadow by someone since he have be in town
how else could it be know so quickly that it be the northumberland hotel which he have choose
if they have follow him the first day i argue that they would follow him also the second
you may have observe that i twice stroll over to the window while dr
mortimer be read his legend
yes i remember
i be look out for loiterers in the street but i saw none
we be deal with a clever man watson
this matter cut very deep and though i have not finally make up my mind whether it be a benevolent or a malevolent agency which be in touch with us i be conscious always of power and design
when our friends leave i at once follow them in the hop of mark down their invisible attendant
so wily be he that he have not trust himself upon foot but he have avail himself of a cab so that he could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice
his method have the additional advantage that if they be to take a cab he be all ready to follow them
it have however one obvious disadvantage
it put him in the power of the cabman
exactly
what a pity we do not get the number
my dear watson clumsy as i have be you surely do not seriously imagine that i neglect to get the number
no
be our man
but that be no use to us for the moment
i fail to see how you could have do more
on observe the cab i should have instantly turn and walk in the other direction
i should then at my leisure have hire a second cab and follow the first at a respectful distance or better still have drive to the northumberland hotel and wait there
when our unknown have follow baskerville home we should have have the opportunity of play his own game upon himself and see where he make for
as it be by an indiscreet eagerness which be take advantage of with extraordinary quickness and energy by our opponent we have betray ourselves and lose our man
we have be saunter slowly down regent street during this conversation and dr
mortimer with his companion have long vanish in front of us
there be no object in our follow them say holmes
the shadow have depart and will not return
we must see what further card we have in our hand and play them with decision
could you swear to that man's face within the cab
i could swear only to the beard
and so could i from which i gather that in all probability it be a false one
a clever man upon so delicate an errand have no use for a beard save to conceal his feature
come in here watson
he turn into one of the district messenger offices where he be warmly greet by the manager
ah wilson i see you have not forget the little case in which i have the good fortune to help you
no sir indeed i have not
you save my good name and perhaps my life
my dear fellow you exaggerate
i have some recollection wilson that you have among your boys a lad name cartwright who show some ability during the investigation
yes sir he be still with us
could you ring him up thank you
and i should be glad to have change of this five pound note
a lad of fourteen with a bright keen face have obey the summon of the manager
he stand now gaze with great reverence at the famous detective
let me have the hotel directory say holmes
thank you
now cartwright there be the name of twenty three hotels here all in the immediate neighbourhood of char cross
do you see
yes sir
you will visit each of these in turn
yes sir
you will begin in each case by give the outside porter one shill
here be twenty three shill
yes sir
you will tell him that you want to see the waste paper of yesterday
you will say that an important telegram have miscarry and that you be look for it
you understand
yes sir
but what you be really look for be the centre page of the time with some hole cut in it with scissor
here be a copy of the time
it be this page
you could easily recognize it could you not
yes sir
in each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter to whom also you will give a shill
here be twenty three shill
you will then learn in possibly twenty case out of the twenty three that the waste of the day before have be burn or remove
in the three other case you will be show a heap of paper and you will look for this page of the time among it
the odds be enormously against your find it
there be ten shill over in case of emergencies
let me have a report by wire at baker street before even
and now watson it only remain for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman no
and then we will drop into one of the bond street picture galleries and fill in the time until we be due at the hotel
sherlock holmes have in a very remarkable degree the power of detach his mind at will
for two hours the strange business in which we have be involve appear to be forget and he be entirely absorb in the picture of the modern belgian master
he would talk of nothing but art of which he have the crudest ideas from our leave the gallery until we find ourselves at the northumberland hotel
sir henry baskerville be upstairs expect you say the clerk
he ask me to show you up at once when you come
have you any objection to my look at your register
say holmes
not in the least
the book show that two name have be add after that of baskerville
one be theophilus johnson and family of newcastle the other mrs
oldmore and maid of high lodge alton
surely that must be the same johnson whom i use to know say holmes to the porter
a lawyer be he not gray head and walk with a limp
no sir this be mr
johnson the coal owner a very active gentleman not older than yourself
surely you be mistake about his trade
no sir
he have use this hotel for many years and he be very well know to us
ah that settle it
mrs
oldmore too i seem to remember the name
excuse my curiosity but often in call upon one friend one find another
she be an invalid lady sir
her husband be once mayor of gloucester
she always come to us when she be in town
thank you i be afraid i cannot claim her acquaintance
we have establish a most important fact by these question watson he continue in a low voice as we go upstairs together
we know now that the people who be so interest in our friend have not settle down in his own hotel
that mean that while they be as we have see very anxious to watch him they be equally anxious that he should not see them
now this be a most suggestive fact
what do it suggest
it suggest halloa my dear fellow what on earth be the matter
as we come round the top of the stairs we have run up against sir henry baskerville himself
his face be flush with anger and he hold an old and dusty boot in one of his hand
so furious be he that he be hardly articulate and when he do speak it be in a much broader and more western dialect than any which we have hear from him in the morning
seem to me they be play me for a sucker in this hotel he cry
they'll find they've start in to monkey with the wrong man unless they be careful
by thunder if that chap can't find my miss boot there will be trouble
i can take a joke with the best mr
holmes but they've get a bite over the mark this time
still look for your boot
yes sir and mean to find it
but surely you say that it be a new brown boot
so it be sir
and now it's an old black one
what
you don't mean to say
that's just what i do mean to say
i only have three pair in the world the new brown the old black and the patent leather which i be wear
last night they take one of my brown ones and today they have sneak one of the black
well have you get it
speak out man and don't stand star
an agitate german waiter have appear upon the scene
no sir i have make inquiry all over the hotel but i can hear no word of it
well either that boot come back before sundown or i'll see the manager and tell him that i go right straight out of this hotel
it shall be find sir i promise you that if you will have a little patience it will be find
mind it be for it's the last thing of mine that i'll lose in this den of thieve
well well mr
holmes you'll excuse my trouble you about such a trifle i think it's well worth trouble about
why you look very serious over it
how do you explain it
i just don't attempt to explain it
it seem the very maddest queerest thing that ever happen to me
the queerest perhaps say holmes thoughtfully
what do you make of it yourself
well i don't profess to understand it yet
this case of yours be very complex sir henry
when take in conjunction with your uncle's death i be not sure that of all the five hundred case of capital importance which i have handle there be one which cut so deep
but we hold several thread in our hand and the odds be that one or other of them guide us to the truth
we may waste time in follow the wrong one but sooner or later we must come upon the right
we have a pleasant luncheon in which little be say of the business which have bring us together
it be in the private sit room to which we afterwards repair that holmes ask baskerville what be his intentions
to go to baskerville hall
and when
at the end of the week
on the whole say holmes i think that your decision be a wise one
i have ample evidence that you be be dog in london and amid the millions of this great city it be difficult to discover who these people be or what their object can be
if their intentions be evil they might do you a mischief and we should be powerless to prevent it
you do not know dr
mortimer that you be follow this morning from my house
dr
mortimer start violently
follow
by whom
that unfortunately be what i cannot tell you
have you among your neighbour or acquaintances on dartmoor any man with a black full beard
no or let me see why yes
barrymore sir charles's butler be a man with a full black beard
ha
where be barrymore
he be in charge of the hall
we have best ascertain if he be really there or if by any possibility he might be in london
how can you do that
give me a telegraph form
'is all ready for sir henry '
that will do
address to mr
barrymore baskerville hall
what be the nearest telegraph office
grimpen
very good we will send a second wire to the postmaster grimpen 'telegram to mr
barrymore to be deliver into his own hand
if absent please return wire to sir henry baskerville northumberland hotel '
that should let us know before even whether barrymore be at his post in devonshire or not
that's so say baskerville
by the way dr
mortimer who be this barrymore anyhow
he be the son of the old caretaker who be dead
they have look after the hall for four generations now
so far as i know he and his wife be as respectable a couple as any in the county
at the same time say baskerville it's clear enough that so long as there be none of the family at the hall these people have a mighty fine home and nothing to do
that be true
do barrymore profit at all by sir charles's will
ask holmes
he and his wife have five hundred pound each
ha
do they know that they would receive this
yes sir charles be very fond of talk about the provision of his will
that be very interest
i hope say dr
mortimer that you do not look with suspicious eye upon everyone who receive a legacy from sir charles for i also have a thousand pound leave to me
indeed
and anyone else
there be many insignificant sum to individuals and a large number of public charities
the residue all go to sir henry
and how much be the residue
seven hundred and forty thousand pound
holmes raise his eyebrows in surprise
i have no idea that so gigantic a sum be involve say he
sir charles have the reputation of be rich but we do not know how very rich he be until we come to examine his securities
the total value of the estate be close on to a million
dear me
it be a stake for which a man might well play a desperate game
and one more question dr
mortimer
suppose that anything happen to our young friend here you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis who would inherit the estate
since rodger baskerville sir charles's younger brother die unmarried the estate would descend to the desmonds who be distant cousins
jam desmond be an elderly clergyman in westmoreland
thank you
these detail be all of great interest
have you meet mr
jam desmond
yes he once come down to visit sir charles
he be a man of venerable appearance and of saintly life
i remember that he refuse to accept any settlement from sir charles though he press it upon him
and this man of simple taste would be the heir to sir charles's thousands
he would be the heir to the estate because that be entail
he would also be the heir to the money unless it be will otherwise by the present owner who can of course do what he like with it
and have you make your will sir henry
no mr
holmes i have not
i've have no time for it be only yesterday that i learn how matter stand
but in any case i feel that the money should go with the title and estate
that be my poor uncle's idea
how be the owner go to restore the glory of the baskervilles if he have not money enough to keep up the property
house land and dollars must go together
quite so
well sir henry i be of one mind with you as to the advisability of your go down to devonshire without delay
there be only one provision which i must make
you certainly must not go alone
dr
mortimer return with me
but dr
mortimer have his practice to attend to and his house be miles away from yours
with all the goodwill in the world he may be unable to help you
no sir henry you must take with you someone a trusty man who will be always by your side
be it possible that you could come yourself mr
holmes
if matter come to a crisis i should endeavour to be present in person but you can understand that with my extensive consult practice and with the constant appeal which reach me from many quarter it be impossible for me to be absent from london for an indefinite time
at the present instant one of the most revere name in england be be besmirch by a blackmailer and only i can stop a disastrous scandal
you will see how impossible it be for me to go to dartmoor
whom would you recommend then
holmes lay his hand upon my arm
if my friend would undertake it there be no man who be better worth have at your side when you be in a tight place
no one can say so more confidently than i
the proposition take me completely by surprise but before i have time to answer baskerville seize me by the hand and wring it heartily
well now that be real kind of you dr
watson say he
you see how it be with me and you know just as much about the matter as i do
if you will come down to baskerville hall and see me through i'll never forget it
the promise of adventure have always a fascination for me and i be compliment by the word of holmes and by the eagerness with which the baronet hail me as a companion
i will come with pleasure say i
i do not know how i could employ my time better
and you will report very carefully to me say holmes
when a crisis come as it will do i will direct how you shall act
i suppose that by saturday all might be ready
would that suit dr
watson
perfectly
then on saturday unless you hear to the contrary we shall meet at the ten thirty train from paddington
we have rise to depart when baskerville give a cry of triumph and dive into one of the corner of the room he draw a brown boot from under a cabinet
my miss boot
he cry
may all our difficulties vanish as easily
say sherlock holmes
but it be a very singular thing dr
mortimer remark
i search this room carefully before lunch
and so do i say baskerville
every inch of it
there be certainly no boot in it then
in that case the waiter must have place it there while we be lunch
the german be send for but profess to know nothing of the matter nor could any inquiry clear it up
another item have be add to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small mysteries which have succeed each other so rapidly
set aside the whole grim story of sir charles's death we have a line of inexplicable incidents all within the limit of two days which include the receipt of the print letter the black beard spy in the hansom the loss of the new brown boot the loss of the old black boot and now the return of the new brown boot
holmes sit in silence in the cab as we drive back to baker street and i know from his draw brows and keen face that his mind like my own be busy in endeavour to frame some scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnect episodes could be fit
all afternoon and late into the even he sit lose in tobacco and think
just before dinner two telegrams be hand in
the first run have just hear that barrymore be at the hall
baskerville
the second visit twenty three hotels as direct but sorry to report unable to trace cut sheet of time
cartwright
there go two of my thread watson
there be nothing more stimulate than a case where everything go against you
we must cast round for another scent
we have still the cabman who drive the spy
exactly
i have wire to get his name and address from the official registry
i should not be surprise if this be an answer to my question
the ring at the bell prove to be something even more satisfactory than an answer however for the door open and a rough look fellow enter who be evidently the man himself
i get a message from the head office that a gent at this address have be inquire for no
say he
i've drive my cab this seven years and never a word of complaint
i come here straight from the yard to ask you to your face what you have against me
i have nothing in the world against you my good man say holmes
on the contrary i have half a sovereign for you if you will give me a clear answer to my question
well i've have a good day and no mistake say the cabman with a grin
what be it you want to ask sir
first of all your name and address in case i want you again
john clayton turpey street the borough
my cab be out of shipley's yard near waterloo station
sherlock holmes make a note of it
now clayton tell me all about the fare who come and watch this house at ten o'clock this morning and afterwards follow the two gentlemen down regent street
the man look surprise and a little embarrass
why there's no good my tell you things for you seem to know as much as i do already say he
the truth be that the gentleman tell me that he be a detective and that i be to say nothing about him to anyone
my good fellow this be a very serious business and you may find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide anything from me
you say that your fare tell you that he be a detective
yes he do
when do he say this
when he leave me
do he say anything more
he mention his name
holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me
oh he mention his name do he
that be imprudent
what be the name that he mention
his name say the cabman be mr
sherlock holmes
never have i see my friend more completely take aback than by the cabman's reply
for an instant he sit in silent amazement
then he burst into a hearty laugh
a touch watson an undeniable touch
say he
i feel a foil as quick and supple as my own
he get home upon me very prettily that time
so his name be sherlock holmes be it
yes sir that be the gentleman's name
excellent
tell me where you pick him up and all that occur
he hail me at half past nine in trafalgar square
he say that he be a detective and he offer me two guineas if i would do exactly what he want all day and ask no question
i be glad enough to agree
first we drive down to the northumberland hotel and wait there until two gentlemen come out and take a cab from the rank
we follow their cab until it pull up somewhere near here
this very door say holmes
well i couldn't be sure of that but i dare say my fare know all about it
we pull up halfway down the street and wait an hour and a half
then the two gentlemen pass us walk and we follow down baker street and along i know say holmes
until we get three quarter down regent street
then my gentleman throw up the trap and he cry that i should drive right away to waterloo station as hard as i could go
i whip up the mare and we be there under the ten minutes
then he pay up his two guineas like a good one and away he go into the station
only just as he be leave he turn round and he say 'it might interest you to know that you have be drive mr
sherlock holmes '
that's how i come to know the name
i see
and you saw no more of him
not after he go into the station
and how would you describe mr
sherlock holmes
the cabman scratch his head
well he wasn't altogether such an easy gentleman to describe
i'd put him at forty years of age and he be of a middle height two or three inch shorter than you sir
he be dress like a toff and he have a black beard cut square at the end and a pale face
i don't know as i could say more than that
colour of his eye
no i can't say that
nothing more that you can remember
no sir nothing
well then here be your half sovereign
there's another one wait for you if you can bring any more information
good night
good night sir and thank you
john clayton depart chuckle and holmes turn to me with a shrug of his shoulder and a rueful smile
snap go our third thread and we end where we begin say he
the cunning rascal
he know our number know that sir henry baskerville have consult me spot who i be in regent street conjecture that i have get the number of the cab and would lay my hand on the driver and so send back this audacious message
i tell you watson this time we have get a foeman who be worthy of our steel
i've be checkmate in london
i can only wish you better luck in devonshire
but i'm not easy in my mind about it
about what
about send you
it's an ugly business watson an ugly dangerous business and the more i see of it the less i like it
yes my dear fellow you may laugh but i give you my word that i shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in baker street once more
sir henry baskerville and dr
mortimer be ready upon the appoint day and we start as arrange for devonshire
mr
sherlock holmes drive with me to the station and give me his last part injunctions and advice
i will not bias your mind by suggest theories or suspicions watson say he i wish you simply to report facts in the fullest possible manner to me and you can leave me to do the theorize
what sort of facts
i ask
anything which may seem to have a bear however indirect upon the case and especially the relations between young baskerville and his neighbour or any fresh particulars concern the death of sir charles
i have make some inquiries myself in the last few days but the result have i fear be negative
one thing only appear to be certain and that be that mr
jam desmond who be the next heir be an elderly gentleman of a very amiable disposition so that this persecution do not arise from him
i really think that we may eliminate him entirely from our calculations
there remain the people who will actually surround sir henry baskerville upon the moor
would it not be well in the first place to get rid of this barrymore couple
by no mean
you could not make a greater mistake
if they be innocent it would be a cruel injustice and if they be guilty we should be give up all chance of bring it home to them
no no we will preserve them upon our list of suspect
then there be a groom at the hall if i remember right
there be two moorland farmers
there be our friend dr
mortimer whom i believe to be entirely honest and there be his wife of whom we know nothing
there be this naturalist stapleton and there be his sister who be say to be a young lady of attractions
there be mr
frankland of lafter hall who be also an unknown factor and there be one or two other neighbour
these be the folk who must be your very special study
i will do my best
you have arm i suppose
yes i think it as well to take them
most certainly
keep your revolver near you night and day and never relax your precautions
our friends have already secure a first class carriage and be wait for us upon the platform
no we have no news of any kind say dr
mortimer in answer to my friend's question
i can swear to one thing and that be that we have not be shadow during the last two days
we have never go out without keep a sharp watch and no one could have escape our notice
you have always keep together i presume
except yesterday afternoon
i usually give up one day to pure amusement when i come to town so i spend it at the museum of the college of surgeons
and i go to look at the folk in the park say baskerville
but we have no trouble of any kind
it be imprudent all the same say holmes shake his head and look very grave
i beg sir henry that you will not go about alone
some great misfortune will befall you if you do
do you get your other boot
no sir it be go forever
indeed
that be very interest
well good bye he add as the train begin to glide down the platform
bear in mind sir henry one of the phrase in that queer old legend which dr
mortimer have read to us and avoid the moor in those hours of darkness when the power of evil be exalt
i look back at the platform when we have leave it far behind and saw the tall austere figure of holmes stand motionless and gaze after us
the journey be a swift and pleasant one and i spend it in make the more intimate acquaintance of my two companion and in play with dr
mortimer's spaniel
in a very few hours the brown earth have become ruddy the brick have change to granite and red cow graze in well hedge field where the lush grass and more luxuriant vegetation speak of a richer if a damper climate
young baskerville star eagerly out of the window and cry aloud with delight as he recognize the familiar feature of the devon scenery
i've be over a good part of the world since i leave it dr
watson say he but i have never see a place to compare with it
i never saw a devonshire man who do not swear by his county i remark
it depend upon the breed of men quite as much as on the county say dr
mortimer
a glance at our friend here reveal the round head of the celt which carry inside it the celtic enthusiasm and power of attachment
poor sir charles's head be of a very rare type half gaelic half ivernian in its characteristics
but you be very young when you last saw baskerville hall be you not
i be a boy in my teens at the time of my father's death and have never see the hall for he live in a little cottage on the south coast
thence i go straight to a friend in america
i tell you it be all as new to me as it be to dr
watson and i'm as keen as possible to see the moor
be you
then your wish be easily grant for there be your first sight of the moor say dr
mortimer point out of the carriage window
over the green square of the field and the low curve of a wood there rise in the distance a gray melancholy hill with a strange jag summit dim and vague in the distance like some fantastic landscape in a dream
baskerville sit for a long time his eye fix upon it and i read upon his eager face how much it mean to him this first sight of that strange spot where the men of his blood have hold sway so long and leave their mark so deep
there he sit with his tweed suit and his american accent in the corner of a prosaic railway carriage and yet as i look at his dark and expressive face i felt more than ever how true a descendant he be of that long line of high blood fiery and masterful men
there be pride valour and strength in his thick brows his sensitive nostrils and his large hazel eye
if on that forbid moor a difficult and dangerous quest should lie before us this be at least a comrade for whom one might venture to take a risk with the certainty that he would bravely share it
the train pull up at a small wayside station and we all descend
outside beyond the low white fence a wagonette with a pair of cobs be wait
our come be evidently a great event for station master and porter cluster round us to carry out our luggage
it be a sweet simple country spot but i be surprise to observe that by the gate there stand two soldierly men in dark uniform who lean upon their short rifle and glance keenly at us as we pass
the coachman a hard face gnarl little fellow salute sir henry baskerville and in a few minutes we be fly swiftly down the broad white road
roll pasture land curve upward on either side of us and old gabled house peep out from amid the thick green foliage but behind the peaceful and sunlit countryside there rise ever dark against the even sky the long gloomy curve of the moor break by the jag and sinister hill
the wagonette swing round into a side road and we curve upward through deep lanes wear by centuries of wheel high bank on either side heavy with drip moss and fleshy hart's tongue ferns
bronze bracken and mottle bramble gleam in the light of the sink sun
still steadily rise we pass over a narrow granite bridge and skirt a noisy stream which gush swiftly down foam and roar amid the gray boulders
both road and stream wind up through a valley dense with scrub oak and fir
at every turn baskerville give an exclamation of delight look eagerly about him and ask countless question
to his eye all seem beautiful but to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon the countryside which bore so clearly the mark of the wan year
yellow leave carpet the lanes and flutter down upon us as we pass
the rattle of our wheel die away as we drive through drift of rot vegetation sad gift as it seem to me for nature to throw before the carriage of the return heir of the baskervilles
halloa
cry dr
mortimer what be this
a steep curve of heath clothe land an outlying spur of the moor lay in front of us
on the summit hard and clear like an equestrian statue upon its pedestal be a mount soldier dark and stern his rifle poise ready over his forearm
he be watch the road along which we travel
what be this perkins
ask dr
mortimer
our driver half turn in his seat
there's a convict escape from princetown sir
he's be out three days now and the warders watch every road and every station but they've have no sight of him yet
the farmers about here don't like it sir and that's a fact
well i understand that they get five pound if they can give information
yes sir but the chance of five pound be but a poor thing compare to the chance of have your throat cut
you see it isn't like any ordinary convict
this be a man that would stick at nothing
who be he then
it be selden the notting hill murderer
i remember the case well for it be one in which holmes have take an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the crime and the wanton brutality which have mark all the action of the assassin
the commutation of his death sentence have be due to some doubt as to his complete sanity so atrocious be his conduct
our wagonette have top a rise and in front of us rise the huge expanse of the moor mottle with gnarl and craggy cairns and tors
a cold wind sweep down from it and set us shiver
somewhere there on that desolate plain be lurk this fiendish man hide in a burrow like a wild beast his heart full of malignancy against the whole race which have cast him out
it need but this to complete the grim suggestiveness of the barren waste the chill wind and the darkling sky
even baskerville fell silent and pull his overcoat more closely around him
we have leave the fertile country behind and beneath us
we look back on it now the slant ray of a low sun turn the stream to thread of gold and glow on the red earth new turn by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands
the road in front of us grow bleaker and wilder over huge russet and olive slop sprinkle with giant boulders
now and then we pass a moorland cottage wall and roof with stone with no creeper to break its harsh outline
suddenly we look down into a cuplike depression patch with stunt oaks and firs which have be twist and bend by the fury of years of storm
two high narrow tower rise over the tree
the driver point with his whip
baskerville hall say he
its master have rise and be star with flush cheek and shin eye
a few minutes later we have reach the lodge gate a maze of fantastic tracery in work iron with weather bite pillars on either side blotch with lichens and surmount by the boars' head of the baskervilles
the lodge be a ruin of black granite and bar rib of rafter but face it be a new build half construct the first fruit of sir charles's south african gold
through the gateway we pass into the avenue where the wheel be again hush amid the leave and the old tree shoot their branch in a sombre tunnel over our head
baskerville shudder as he look up the long dark drive to where the house glimmer like a ghost at the farther end
be it here
he ask in a low voice
no no the yew alley be on the other side
the young heir glance round with a gloomy face
it's no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble be come on him in such a place as this say he
it's enough to scare any man
i'll have a row of electric lamps up here inside of six months and you won't know it again with a thousand candle power swan and edison right here in front of the hall door
the avenue open into a broad expanse of turf and the house lay before us
in the fade light i could see that the centre be a heavy block of build from which a porch project
the whole front be drape in ivy with a patch clip bare here and there where a window or a coat of arm break through the dark veil
from this central block rise the twin tower ancient crenelate and pierce with many loopholes
to right and leave of the turrets be more modern wing of black granite
a dull light shine through heavy mullioned windows and from the high chimneys which rise from the steep high angle roof there spring a single black column of smoke
welcome sir henry
welcome to baskerville hall
a tall man have step from the shadow of the porch to open the door of the wagonette
the figure of a woman be silhouette against the yellow light of the hall
she come out and help the man to hand down our bag
you don't mind my drive straight home sir henry
say dr
mortimer
my wife be expect me
surely you will stay and have some dinner
no i must go
i shall probably find some work await me
i would stay to show you over the house but barrymore will be a better guide than i good bye and never hesitate night or day to send for me if i can be of service
the wheel die away down the drive while sir henry and i turn into the hall and the door clang heavily behind us
it be a fine apartment in which we find ourselves large lofty and heavily rafter with huge baulk of age blacken oak
in the great old fashion fireplace behind the high iron dog a log fire crackle and snap
sir henry and i hold out our hand to it for we be numb from our long drive
then we gaze round us at the high thin window of old stain glass the oak panel the stags' head the coat of arm upon the wall all dim and sombre in the subdue light of the central lamp
it's just as i imagine it say sir henry
be it not the very picture of an old family home
to think that this should be the same hall in which for five hundred years my people have live
it strike me solemn to think of it
i saw his dark face light up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gaze about him
the light beat upon him where he stand but long shadow trail down the wall and hang like a black canopy above him
barrymore have return from take our luggage to our room
he stand in front of us now with the subdue manner of a well train servant
he be a remarkable look man tall handsome with a square black beard and pale distinguish feature
would you wish dinner to be serve at once sir
be it ready
in a very few minutes sir
you will find hot water in your room
my wife and i will be happy sir henry to stay with you until you have make your fresh arrangements but you will understand that under the new condition this house will require a considerable staff
what new condition
i only mean sir that sir charles lead a very retire life and we be able to look after his want
you would naturally wish to have more company and so you will need change in your household
do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave
only when it be quite convenient to you sir
but your family have be with us for several generations have they not
i should be sorry to begin my life here by break an old family connection
i seem to discern some sign of emotion upon the butler's white face
i feel that also sir and so do my wife
but to tell the truth sir we be both very much attach to sir charles and his death give us a shock and make these surround very painful to us
i fear that we shall never again be easy in our mind at baskerville hall
but what do you intend to do
i have no doubt sir that we shall succeed in establish ourselves in some business
sir charles's generosity have give us the mean to do so
and now sir perhaps i have best show you to your room
a square balustraded gallery run round the top of the old hall approach by a double stair
from this central point two long corridors extend the whole length of the build from which all the bedrooms open
my own be in the same wing as baskerville's and almost next door to it
these room appear to be much more modern than the central part of the house and the bright paper and numerous candle do something to remove the sombre impression which our arrival have leave upon my mind
but the din room which open out of the hall be a place of shadow and gloom
it be a long chamber with a step separate the dais where the family sit from the lower portion reserve for their dependents
at one end a minstrel's gallery overlook it
black beam shoot across above our head with a smoke darken ceiling beyond them
with row of flare torch to light it up and the colour and rude hilarity of an old time banquet it might have soften but now when two black clothe gentlemen sit in the little circle of light throw by a shade lamp one's voice become hush and one's spirit subdue
a dim line of ancestors in every variety of dress from the elizabethan knight to the buck of the regency star down upon us and daunt us by their silent company
we talk little and i for one be glad when the meal be over and we be able to retire into the modern billiard room and smoke a cigarette
my word it isn't a very cheerful place say sir henry
i suppose one can tone down to it but i feel a bite out of the picture at present
i don't wonder that my uncle get a little jumpy if he live all alone in such a house as this
however if it suit you we will retire early tonight and perhaps things may seem more cheerful in the morning
i draw aside my curtain before i go to bed and look out from my window
it open upon the grassy space which lay in front of the hall door
beyond two cop of tree moan and swing in a rise wind
a half moon break through the rifts of race cloud
in its cold light i saw beyond the tree a break fringe of rock and the long low curve of the melancholy moor
i close the curtain feel that my last impression be in keep with the rest
and yet it be not quite the last
i find myself weary and yet wakeful toss restlessly from side to side seek for the sleep which would not come
far away a chime clock strike out the quarter of the hours but otherwise a deathly silence lay upon the old house
and then suddenly in the very dead of the night there come a sound to my ears clear resonant and unmistakable
it be the sob of a woman the muffle strangle gasp of one who be tear by an uncontrollable sorrow
i sit up in bed and listen intently
the noise could not have be far away and be certainly in the house
for half an hour i wait with every nerve on the alert but there come no other sound save the chime clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall
the fresh beauty of the follow morning do something to efface from our mind the grim and gray impression which have be leave upon both of us by our first experience of baskerville hall
as sir henry and i sit at breakfast the sunlight flood in through the high mullioned windows throw watery patch of colour from the coat of arm which cover them
the dark panel glow like bronze in the golden ray and it be hard to realize that this be indeed the chamber which have strike such a gloom into our souls upon the even before
i guess it be ourselves and not the house that we have to blame
say the baronet
we be tire with our journey and chill by our drive so we take a gray view of the place
now we be fresh and well so it be all cheerful once more
and yet it be not entirely a question of imagination i answer
do you for example happen to hear someone a woman i think sob in the night
that be curious for i do when i be half asleep fancy that i hear something of the sort
i wait quite a time but there be no more of it so i conclude that it be all a dream
i hear it distinctly and i be sure that it be really the sob of a woman
we must ask about this right away
he ring the bell and ask barrymore whether he could account for our experience
it seem to me that the pallid feature of the butler turn a shade paler still as he listen to his master's question
there be only two women in the house sir henry he answer
one be the scullery maid who sleep in the other wing
the other be my wife and i can answer for it that the sound could not have come from her
and yet he lie as he say it for it chance that after breakfast i meet mrs
barrymore in the long corridor with the sun full upon her face
she be a large impassive heavy feature woman with a stern set expression of mouth
but her telltale eye be red and glance at me from between swell lids
it be she then who weep in the night and if she do so her husband must know it
yet he have take the obvious risk of discovery in declare that it be not so
why have he do this
and why do she weep so bitterly
already round this pale face handsome black beard man there be gather an atmosphere of mystery and of gloom
it be he who have be the first to discover the body of sir charles and we have only his word for all the circumstances which lead up to the old man's death
be it possible that it be barrymore after all whom we have see in the cab in regent street
the beard might well have be the same
the cabman have describe a somewhat shorter man but such an impression might easily have be erroneous
how could i settle the point forever
obviously the first thing to do be to see the grimpen postmaster and find whether the test telegram have really be place in barrymore's own hand
be the answer what it might i should at least have something to report to sherlock holmes
sir henry have numerous paper to examine after breakfast so that the time be propitious for my excursion
it be a pleasant walk of four miles along the edge of the moor lead me at last to a small gray hamlet in which two larger build which prove to be the inn and the house of dr
mortimer stand high above the rest
the postmaster who be also the village grocer have a clear recollection of the telegram
certainly sir say he i have the telegram deliver to mr
barrymore exactly as direct
who deliver it
my boy here
jam you deliver that telegram to mr
barrymore at the hall last week do you not
yes father i deliver it
into his own hand
i ask
well he be up in the loft at the time so that i could not put it into his own hand but i give it into mrs
barrymore's hand and she promise to deliver it at once
do you see mr
barrymore
no sir i tell you he be in the loft
if you didn't see him how do you know he be in the loft
well surely his own wife ought to know where he be say the postmaster testily
didn't he get the telegram
if there be any mistake it be for mr
barrymore himself to complain
it seem hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther but it be clear that in spite of holmes's ruse we have no proof that barrymore have not be in london all the time
suppose that it be so suppose that the same man have be the last who have see sir charles alive and the first to dog the new heir when he return to england
what then
be he the agent of others or have he some sinister design of his own
what interest could he have in persecute the baskerville family
i think of the strange warn clip out of the lead article of the time
be that his work or be it possibly the do of someone who be bend upon counteract his scheme
the only conceivable motive be that which have be suggest by sir henry that if the family could be scar away a comfortable and permanent home would be secure for the barrymores
but surely such an explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the deep and subtle scheme which seem to be weave an invisible net round the young baronet
holmes himself have say that no more complex case have come to him in all the long series of his sensational investigations
i pray as i walk back along the gray lonely road that my friend might soon be free from his preoccupations and able to come down to take this heavy burden of responsibility from my shoulder
suddenly my thoughts be interrupt by the sound of run feet behind me and by a voice which call me by name
i turn expect to see dr
mortimer but to my surprise it be a stranger who be pursue me
he be a small slim clean shave prim face man flaxen haired and leanjawed between thirty and forty years of age dress in a gray suit and wear a straw hat
a tin box for botanical specimens hang over his shoulder and he carry a green butterfly net in one of his hand
you will i be sure excuse my presumption dr
watson say he as he come pant up to where i stand
here on the moor we be homely folk and do not wait for formal introductions
you may possibly have hear my name from our mutual friend mortimer
i be stapleton of merripit house
your net and box would have tell me as much say i for i know that mr
stapleton be a naturalist
but how do you know me
i have be call on mortimer and he point you out to me from the window of his surgery as you pass
as our road lay the same way i think that i would overtake you and introduce myself
i trust that sir henry be none the worse for his journey
he be very well thank you
we be all rather afraid that after the sad death of sir charles the new baronet might refuse to live here
it be ask much of a wealthy man to come down and bury himself in a place of this kind but i need not tell you that it mean a very great deal to the countryside
sir henry have i suppose no superstitious fear in the matter
i do not think that it be likely
of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunt the family
i have hear it
it be extraordinary how credulous the peasants be about here
any number of them be ready to swear that they have see such a creature upon the moor
he speak with a smile but i seem to read in his eye that he take the matter more seriously
the story take a great hold upon the imagination of sir charles and i have no doubt that it lead to his tragic end
but how
his nerve be so work up that the appearance of any dog might have have a fatal effect upon his diseased heart
i fancy that he really do see something of the kind upon that last night in the yew alley
i fear that some disaster might occur for i be very fond of the old man and i know that his heart be weak
how do you know that
my friend mortimer tell me
you think then that some dog pursue sir charles and that he die of fright in consequence
have you any better explanation
i have not come to any conclusion
have mr
sherlock holmes
the word take away my breath for an instant but a glance at the placid face and steadfast eye of my companion show that no surprise be intend
it be useless for us to pretend that we do not know you dr
watson say he
the record of your detective have reach us here and you could not celebrate him without be know yourself
when mortimer tell me your name he could not deny your identity
if you be here then it follow that mr
sherlock holmes be interest himself in the matter and i be naturally curious to know what view he may take
i be afraid that i cannot answer that question
may i ask if he be go to honour us with a visit himself
he cannot leave town at present
he have other case which engage his attention
what a pity
he might throw some light on that which be so dark to us
but as to your own research if there be any possible way in which i can be of service to you i trust that you will command me
if i have any indication of the nature of your suspicions or how you propose to investigate the case i might perhaps even now give you some aid or advice
i assure you that i be simply here upon a visit to my friend sir henry and that i need no help of any kind
excellent
say stapleton
you be perfectly right to be wary and discreet
i be justly reprove for what i feel be an unjustifiable intrusion and i promise you that i will not mention the matter again
we have come to a point where a narrow grassy path strike off from the road and wind away across the moor
a steep boulder sprinkle hill lay upon the right which have in bygone days be cut into a granite quarry
the face which be turn towards us form a dark cliff with ferns and brambles grow in its niches
from over a distant rise there float a gray plume of smoke
a moderate walk along this moor path bring us to merripit house say he
perhaps you will spare an hour that i may have the pleasure of introduce you to my sister
my first think be that i should be by sir henry's side
but then i remember the pile of paper and bill with which his study table be litter
it be certain that i could not help with those
and holmes have expressly say that i should study the neighbour upon the moor
i accept stapleton's invitation and we turn together down the path
it be a wonderful place the moor say he look round over the undulate down long green rollers with crest of jag granite foam up into fantastic surge
you never tire of the moor
you cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contain
it be so vast and so barren and so mysterious
you know it well then
i have only be here two years
the residents would call me a newcomer
we come shortly after sir charles settle
but my taste lead me to explore every part of the country round and i should think that there be few men who know it better than i do
be it hard to know
very hard
you see for example this great plain to the north here with the queer hill break out of it
do you observe anything remarkable about that
it would be a rare place for a gallop
you would naturally think so and the think have cost several their live before now
you notice those bright green spot scatter thickly over it
yes they seem more fertile than the rest
stapleton laugh
that be the great grimpen mire say he
a false step yonder mean death to man or beast
only yesterday i saw one of the moor ponies wander into it
he never come out
i saw his head for quite a long time crane out of the bog hole but it suck him down at last
even in dry season it be a danger to cross it but after these autumn rain it be an awful place
and yet i can find my way to the very heart of it and return alive
by george there be another of those miserable ponies
something brown be roll and toss among the green sedges
then a long agonize writhe neck shoot upward and a dreadful cry echo over the moor
it turn me cold with horror but my companion's nerve seem to be stronger than mine
it's go
say he
the mire have him
two in two days and many more perhaps for they get in the way of go there in the dry weather and never know the difference until the mire have them in its clutch
it's a bad place the great grimpen mire
and you say you can penetrate it
yes there be one or two paths which a very active man can take
i have find them out
but why should you wish to go into so horrible a place
well you see the hill beyond
they be really islands cut off on all side by the impassable mire which have crawl round them in the course of years
that be where the rare plant and the butterfly be if you have the wit to reach them
i shall try my luck some day
he look at me with a surprise face
for god's sake put such an idea out of your mind say he
your blood would be upon my head
i assure you that there would not be the least chance of your come back alive
it be only by remember certain complex landmarks that i be able to do it
halloa
i cry
what be that
a long low moan indescribably sad sweep over the moor
it fill the whole air and yet it be impossible to say whence it come
from a dull murmur it swell into a deep roar and then sink back into a melancholy throb murmur once again
stapleton look at me with a curious expression in his face
queer place the moor
say he
but what be it
the peasants say it be the hound of the baskervilles call for its prey
i've hear it once or twice before but never quite so loud
i look round with a chill of fear in my heart at the huge swell plain mottle with the green patch of rush
nothing stir over the vast expanse save a pair of raven which croak loudly from a tor behind us
you be an educate man
you don't believe such nonsense as that
say i
what do you think be the cause of so strange a sound
bog make queer noise sometimes
it's the mud settle or the water rise or something
no no that be a live voice
well perhaps it be
do you ever hear a bittern boom
no i never do
it's a very rare bird practically extinct in england now but all things be possible upon the moor
yes i should not be surprise to learn that what we have hear be the cry of the last of the bitterns
it's the weirdest strangest thing that ever i hear in my life
yes it's rather an uncanny place altogether
look at the hillside yonder
what do you make of those
the whole steep slope be cover with gray circular ring of stone a score of them at least
what be they
sheep pen
no they be the home of our worthy ancestors
prehistoric man live thickly on the moor and as no one in particular have live there since we find all his little arrangements exactly as he leave them
these be his wigwams with the roof off
you can even see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go inside
but it be quite a town
when be it inhabit
neolithic man no date
what do he do
he graze his cattle on these slop and he learn to dig for tin when the bronze sword begin to supersede the stone axe
look at the great trench in the opposite hill
that be his mark
yes you will find some very singular point about the moor dr
watson
oh excuse me an instant
it be surely cyclopides
a small fly or moth have flutter across our path and in an instant stapleton be rush with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it
to my dismay the creature fly straight for the great mire and my acquaintance never pause for an instant bound from tuft to tuft behind it his green net wave in the air
his gray clothe and jerky zigzag irregular progress make him not unlike some huge moth himself
i be stand watch his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his foot in the treacherous mire when i hear the sound of step and turn round find a woman near me upon the path
she have come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicate the position of merripit house but the dip of the moor have hide her until she be quite close
i could not doubt that this be the miss stapleton of whom i have be tell since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor and i remember that i have hear someone describe her as be a beauty
the woman who approach me be certainly that and of a most uncommon type
there could not have be a greater contrast between brother and sister for stapleton be neutral tint with light hair and gray eye while she be darker than any brunette whom i have see in england slim elegant and tall
she have a proud finely cut face so regular that it might have seem impassive be it not for the sensitive mouth and the beautiful dark eager eye
with her perfect figure and elegant dress she be indeed a strange apparition upon a lonely moorland path
her eye be on her brother as i turn and then she quicken her pace towards me
i have raise my hat and be about to make some explanatory remark when her own word turn all my thoughts into a new channel
go back
she say
go straight back to london instantly
i could only stare at her in stupid surprise
her eye blaze at me and she tap the grind impatiently with her foot
why should i go back
i ask
i cannot explain
she speak in a low eager voice with a curious lisp in her utterance
but for god's sake do what i ask you
go back and never set foot upon the moor again
but i have only just come
man man
she cry
can you not tell when a warn be for your own good
go back to london
start tonight
get away from this place at all cost
hush my brother be come
not a word of what i have say
would you mind get that orchid for me among the mare's tail yonder
we be very rich in orchids on the moor though of course you be rather late to see the beauties of the place
stapleton have abandon the chase and come back to us breathe hard and flush with his exertions
halloa beryl
say he and it seem to me that the tone of his greet be not altogether a cordial one
well jack you be very hot
yes i be chase a cyclopides
he be very rare and seldom find in the late autumn
what a pity that i should have miss him
he speak unconcernedly but his small light eye glance incessantly from the girl to me
you have introduce yourselves i can see
yes
i be tell sir henry that it be rather late for him to see the true beauties of the moor
why who do you think this be
i imagine that it must be sir henry baskerville
no no say i
only a humble commoner but his friend
my name be dr
watson
a flush of vexation pass over her expressive face
we have be talk at cross purpose say she
why you have not very much time for talk her brother remark with the same question eye
i talk as if dr
watson be a resident instead of be merely a visitor say she
it cannot much matter to him whether it be early or late for the orchids
but you will come on will you not and see merripit house
a short walk bring us to it a bleak moorland house once the farm of some grazier in the old prosperous days but now put into repair and turn into a modern dwell
an orchard surround it but the tree as be usual upon the moor be stunt and nip and the effect of the whole place be mean and melancholy
we be admit by a strange wizened rusty coat old manservant who seem in keep with the house
inside however there be large room furnish with an elegance in which i seem to recognize the taste of the lady
as i look from their windows at the interminable granite fleck moor roll unbroken to the farthest horizon i could not but marvel at what could have bring this highly educate man and this beautiful woman to live in such a place
queer spot to choose be it not
say he as if in answer to my think
and yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy do we not beryl
quite happy say she but there be no ring of conviction in her word
i have a school say stapleton
it be in the north country
the work to a man of my temperament be mechanical and uninteresting but the privilege of live with youth of help to mould those young mind and of impress them with one's own character and ideals be very dear to me
however the fat be against us
a serious epidemic break out in the school and three of the boys die
it never recover from the blow and much of my capital be irretrievably swallow up
and yet if it be not for the loss of the charm companionship of the boys i could rejoice over my own misfortune for with my strong taste for botany and zoology i find an unlimited field of work here and my sister be as devote to nature as i be
all this dr
watson have be bring upon your head by your expression as you survey the moor out of our window
it certainly do cross my mind that it might be a little dull less for you perhaps than for your sister
no no i be never dull say she quickly
we have book we have our study and we have interest neighbour
dr
mortimer be a most learn man in his own line
poor sir charles be also an admirable companion
we know him well and miss him more than i can tell
do you think that i should intrude if i be to call this afternoon and make the acquaintance of sir henry
i be sure that he would be delight
then perhaps you would mention that i propose to do so
we may in our humble way do something to make things more easy for him until he become accustom to his new surround
will you come upstairs dr
watson and inspect my collection of lepidoptera
i think it be the most complete one in the south west of england
by the time that you have look through them lunch will be almost ready
but i be eager to get back to my charge
the melancholy of the moor the death of the unfortunate pony the weird sound which have be associate with the grim legend of the baskervilles all these things ting my thoughts with sadness
then on the top of these more or less vague impressions there have come the definite and distinct warn of miss stapleton deliver with such intense earnestness that i could not doubt that some grave and deep reason lay behind it
i resist all pressure to stay for lunch and i set off at once upon my return journey take the grass grow path by which we have come
it seem however that there must have be some short cut for those who know it for before i have reach the road i be astound to see miss stapleton sit upon a rock by the side of the track
her face be beautifully flush with her exertions and she hold her hand to her side
i have run all the way in order to cut you off dr
watson say she
i have not even time to put on my hat
i must not stop or my brother may miss me
i want to say to you how sorry i be about the stupid mistake i make in think that you be sir henry
please forget the word i say which have no application whatever to you
but i can't forget them miss stapleton say i
i be sir henry's friend and his welfare be a very close concern of mine
tell me why it be that you be so eager that sir henry should return to london
a woman's whim dr
watson
when you know me better you will understand that i cannot always give reason for what i say or do
no no
i remember the thrill in your voice
i remember the look in your eye
please please be frank with me miss stapleton for ever since i have be here i have be conscious of shadow all round me
life have become like that great grimpen mire with little green patch everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track
tell me then what it be that you mean and i will promise to convey your warn to sir henry
an expression of irresolution pass for an instant over her face but her eye have harden again when she answer me
you make too much of it dr
watson say she
my brother and i be very much shock by the death of sir charles
we know him very intimately for his favourite walk be over the moor to our house
he be deeply impress with the curse which hang over the family and when this tragedy come i naturally felt that there must be some ground for the fear which he have express
i be distress therefore when another member of the family come down to live here and i felt that he should be warn of the danger which he will run
that be all which i intend to convey
but what be the danger
you know the story of the hound
i do not believe in such nonsense
but i do
if you have any influence with sir henry take him away from a place which have always be fatal to his family
the world be wide
why should he wish to live at the place of danger
because it be the place of danger
that be sir henry's nature
i fear that unless you can give me some more definite information than this it would be impossible to get him to move
i cannot say anything definite for i do not know anything definite
i would ask you one more question miss stapleton
if you mean no more than this when you first speak to me why should you not wish your brother to overhear what you say
there be nothing to which he or anyone else could object
my brother be very anxious to have the hall inhabit for he think it be for the good of the poor folk upon the moor
he would be very angry if he know that i have say anything which might induce sir henry to go away
but i have do my duty now and i will say no more
i must go back or he will miss me and suspect that i have see you
good bye
she turn and have disappear in a few minutes among the scatter boulders while i with my soul full of vague fear pursue my way to baskerville hall
from this point onward i will follow the course of events by transcribe my own letter to mr
sherlock holmes which lie before me on the table
one page be miss but otherwise they be exactly as write and show my feel and suspicions of the moment more accurately than my memory clear as it be upon these tragic events can possibly do
baskerville hall october 13th
my dear holmes my previous letter and telegrams have keep you pretty well up to date as to all that have occur in this most god forsake corner of the world
the longer one stay here the more do the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul its vastness and also its grim charm
when you be once out upon its bosom you have leave all trace of modern england behind you but on the other hand you be conscious everywhere of the home and the work of the prehistoric people
on all side of you as you walk be the house of these forget folk with their grave and the huge monoliths which be suppose to have mark their temples
as you look at their gray stone huts against the scar hillsides you leave your own age behind you and if you be to see a skin clothe hairy man crawl out from the low door fit a flint tip arrow on to the string of his bow you would feel that his presence there be more natural than your own
the strange thing be that they should have live so thickly on what must always have be most unfruitful soil
i be no antiquarian but i could imagine that they be some unwarlike and harry race who be force to accept that which none other would occupy
all this however be foreign to the mission on which you send me and will probably be very uninteresting to your severely practical mind
i can still remember your complete indifference as to whether the sun move round the earth or the earth round the sun
let me therefore return to the facts concern sir henry baskerville
if you have not have any report within the last few days it be because up to today there be nothing of importance to relate
then a very surprise circumstance occur which i shall tell you in due course
but first of all i must keep you in touch with some of the other factor in the situation
one of these concern which i have say little be the escape convict upon the moor
there be strong reason now to believe that he have get right away which be a considerable relief to the lonely householders of this district
a fortnight have pass since his flight during which he have not be see and nothing have be hear of him
it be surely inconceivable that he could have hold out upon the moor during all that time
of course so far as his concealment go there be no difficulty at all
any one of these stone huts would give him a hide place
but there be nothing to eat unless he be to catch and slaughter one of the moor sheep
we think therefore that he have go and the outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence
we be four able body men in this household so that we could take good care of ourselves but i confess that i have have uneasy moments when i have think of the stapletons
they live miles from any help
there be one maid an old manservant the sister and the brother the latter not a very strong man
they would be helpless in the hand of a desperate fellow like this notting hill criminal if he could once effect an entrance
both sir henry and i be concern at their situation and it be suggest that perkins the groom should go over to sleep there but stapleton would not hear of it
the fact be that our friend the baronet begin to display a considerable interest in our fair neighbour
it be not to be wonder at for time hang heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like him and she be a very fascinate and beautiful woman
there be something tropical and exotic about her which form a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother
yet he also give the idea of hide fire
he have certainly a very mark influence over her for i have see her continually glance at him as she talk as if seek approbation for what she say
i trust that he be kind to her
there be a dry glitter in his eye and a firm set of his thin lips which go with a positive and possibly a harsh nature
you would find him an interest study
he come over to call upon baskerville on that first day and the very next morning he take us both to show us the spot where the legend of the wicked hugo be suppose to have have its origin
it be an excursion of some miles across the moor to a place which be so dismal that it might have suggest the story
we find a short valley between rugged tors which lead to an open grassy space fleck over with the white cotton grass
in the middle of it rise two great stone wear and sharpen at the upper end until they look like the huge corrode fangs of some monstrous beast
in every way it correspond with the scene of the old tragedy
sir henry be much interest and ask stapleton more than once whether he do really believe in the possibility of the interference of the supernatural in the affairs of men
he speak lightly but it be evident that he be very much in earnest
stapleton be guard in his reply but it be easy to see that he say less than he might and that he would not express his whole opinion out of consideration for the feel of the baronet
he tell us of similar case where families have suffer from some evil influence and he leave us with the impression that he share the popular view upon the matter
on our way back we stay for lunch at merripit house and it be there that sir henry make the acquaintance of miss stapleton
from the first moment that he saw her he appear to be strongly attract by her and i be much mistake if the feel be not mutual
he refer to her again and again on our walk home and since then hardly a day have pass that we have not see something of the brother and sister
they dine here tonight and there be some talk of our go to them next week
one would imagine that such a match would be very welcome to stapleton and yet i have more than once catch a look of the strongest disapprobation in his face when sir henry have be pay some attention to his sister
he be much attach to her no doubt and would lead a lonely life without her but it would seem the height of selfishness if he be to stand in the way of her make so brilliant a marriage
yet i be certain that he do not wish their intimacy to ripen into love and i have several time observe that he have take pain to prevent them from be tete a tete
by the way your instructions to me never to allow sir henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a love affair be to be add to our other difficulties
my popularity would soon suffer if i be to carry out your order to the letter
the other day thursday to be more exact dr
mortimer lunch with us
he have be excavate a barrow at long down and have get a prehistoric skull which fill him with great joy
never be there such a single mind enthusiast as he
the stapletons come in afterwards and the good doctor take us all to the yew alley at sir henry's request to show us exactly how everything occur upon that fatal night
it be a long dismal walk the yew alley between two high wall of clip hedge with a narrow band of grass upon either side
at the far end be an old tumble down summer house
halfway down be the moor gate where the old gentleman leave his cigar ash
it be a white wooden gate with a latch
beyond it lie the wide moor
i remember your theory of the affair and try to picture all that have occur
as the old man stand there he saw something come across the moor something which terrify him so that he lose his wits and run and run until he die of sheer horror and exhaustion
there be the long gloomy tunnel down which he flee
and from what
a sheep dog of the moor
or a spectral hound black silent and monstrous
be there a human agency in the matter
do the pale watchful barrymore know more than he care to say
it be all dim and vague but always there be the dark shadow of crime behind it
one other neighbour i have meet since i write last
this be mr
frankland of lafter hall who live some four miles to the south of us
he be an elderly man red face white haired and choleric
his passion be for the british law and he have spend a large fortune in litigation
he fight for the mere pleasure of fight and be equally ready to take up either side of a question so that it be no wonder that he have find it a costly amusement
sometimes he will shut up a right of way and defy the parish to make him open it
at others he will with his own hand tear down some other man's gate and declare that a path have exist there from time immemorial defy the owner to prosecute him for trespass
he be learn in old manorial and communal right and he apply his knowledge sometimes in favour of the villagers of fernworthy and sometimes against them so that he be periodically either carry in triumph down the village street or else burn in effigy accord to his latest exploit
he be say to have about seven lawsuits upon his hand at present which will probably swallow up the remainder of his fortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the future
apart from the law he seem a kindly good natured person and i only mention him because you be particular that i should send some description of the people who surround us
he be curiously employ at present for be an amateur astronomer he have an excellent telescope with which he lie upon the roof of his own house and sweep the moor all day in the hope of catch a glimpse of the escape convict
if he would confine his energies to this all would be well but there be rumour that he intend to prosecute dr
mortimer for open a grave without the consent of the next of kin because he dig up the neolithic skull in the barrow on long down
he help to keep our live from be monotonous and give a little comic relief where it be badly need
and now have bring you up to date in the escape convict the stapletons dr
mortimer and frankland of lafter hall let me end on that which be most important and tell you more about the barrymores and especially about the surprise development of last night
first of all about the test telegram which you send from london in order to make sure that barrymore be really here
i have already explain that the testimony of the postmaster show that the test be worthless and that we have no proof one way or the other
i tell sir henry how the matter stand and he at once in his downright fashion have barrymore up and ask him whether he have receive the telegram himself
barrymore say that he have
do the boy deliver it into your own hand
ask sir henry
barrymore look surprise and consider for a little time
no say he i be in the box room at the time and my wife bring it up to me
do you answer it yourself
no i tell my wife what to answer and she go down to write it
in the even he recur to the subject of his own accord
i could not quite understand the object of your question this morning sir henry say he
i trust that they do not mean that i have do anything to forfeit your confidence
sir henry have to assure him that it be not so and pacify him by give him a considerable part of his old wardrobe the london outfit have now all arrive
mrs
barrymore be of interest to me
she be a heavy solid person very limit intensely respectable and incline to be puritanical
you could hardly conceive a less emotional subject
yet i have tell you how on the first night here i hear her sob bitterly and since then i have more than once observe trace of tear upon her face
some deep sorrow gnaw ever at her heart
sometimes i wonder if she have a guilty memory which haunt her and sometimes i suspect barrymore of be a domestic tyrant
i have always felt that there be something singular and questionable in this man's character but the adventure of last night bring all my suspicions to a head
and yet it may seem a small matter in itself
you be aware that i be not a very sound sleeper and since i have be on guard in this house my slumber have be lighter than ever
last night about two in the morning i be arouse by a stealthy step pass my room
i rise open my door and peep out
a long black shadow be trail down the corridor
it be throw by a man who walk softly down the passage with a candle hold in his hand
he be in shirt and trousers with no cover to his feet
i could merely see the outline but his height tell me that it be barrymore
he walk very slowly and circumspectly and there be something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance
i have tell you that the corridor be break by the balcony which run round the hall but that it be resume upon the farther side
i wait until he have pass out of sight and then i follow him
when i come round the balcony he have reach the end of the farther corridor and i could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he have enter one of the room
now all these room be unfurnished and unoccupied so that his expedition become more mysterious than ever
the light shine steadily as if he be stand motionless
i creep down the passage as noiselessly as i could and peep round the corner of the door
barrymore be crouch at the window with the candle hold against the glass
his profile be half turn towards me and his face seem to be rigid with expectation as he star out into the blackness of the moor
for some minutes he stand watch intently
then he give a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light
instantly i make my way back to my room and very shortly come the stealthy step pass once more upon their return journey
long afterwards when i have fall into a light sleep i hear a key turn somewhere in a lock but i could not tell whence the sound come
what it all mean i cannot guess but there be some secret business go on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of
i do not trouble you with my theories for you ask me to furnish you only with facts
i have have a long talk with sir henry this morning and we have make a plan of campaign found upon my observations of last night
i will not speak about it just now but it should make my next report interest read
baskerville hall oct
15th
my dear holmes if i be compel to leave you without much news during the early days of my mission you must acknowledge that i be make up for lose time and that events be now crowd thick and fast upon us
in my last report i end upon my top note with barrymore at the window and now i have quite a budget already which will unless i be much mistake considerably surprise you
things have take a turn which i could not have anticipate
in some ways they have within the last forty eight hours become much clearer and in some ways they have become more complicate
but i will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself
before breakfast on the morning follow my adventure i go down the corridor and examine the room in which barrymore have be on the night before
the western window through which he have star so intently have i notice one peculiarity above all other windows in the house it command the nearest outlook on to the moor
there be an open between two tree which enable one from this point of view to look right down upon it while from all the other windows it be only a distant glimpse which can be obtain
it follow therefore that barrymore since only this window would serve the purpose must have be look out for something or somebody upon the moor
the night be very dark so that i can hardly imagine how he could have hop to see anyone
it have strike me that it be possible that some love intrigue be on foot
that would have account for his stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness of his wife
the man be a strike look fellow very well equip to steal the heart of a country girl so that this theory seem to have something to support it
that open of the door which i have hear after i have return to my room might mean that he have go out to keep some clandestine appointment
so i reason with myself in the morning and i tell you the direction of my suspicions however much the result may have show that they be unfounded
but whatever the true explanation of barrymore's movements might be i felt that the responsibility of keep them to myself until i could explain them be more than i could bear
i have an interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast and i tell him all that i have see
he be less surprise than i have expect
i know that barrymore walk about nights and i have a mind to speak to him about it say he
two or three time i have hear his step in the passage come and go just about the hour you name
perhaps then he pay a visit every night to that particular window i suggest
perhaps he do
if so we should be able to shadow him and see what it be that he be after
i wonder what your friend holmes would do if he be here
i believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest say i
he would follow barrymore and see what he do
then we shall do it together
but surely he would hear us
the man be rather deaf and in any case we must take our chance of that
we'll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he pass
sir henry rub his hand with pleasure and it be evident that he hail the adventure as a relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor
the baronet have be in communication with the architect who prepare the plan for sir charles and with a contractor from london so that we may expect great change to begin here soon
there have be decorators and furnishers up from plymouth and it be evident that our friend have large ideas and mean to spare no pain or expense to restore the grandeur of his family
when the house be renovate and refurnish all that he will need will be a wife to make it complete
between ourselves there be pretty clear sign that this will not be want if the lady be will for i have seldom see a man more infatuate with a woman than he be with our beautiful neighbour miss stapleton
and yet the course of true love do not run quite as smoothly as one would under the circumstances expect
today for example its surface be break by a very unexpected ripple which have cause our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance
after the conversation which i have quote about barrymore sir henry put on his hat and prepare to go out
as a matter of course i do the same
what be you come watson
he ask look at me in a curious way
that depend on whether you be go on the moor say i
yes i be
well you know what my instructions be
i be sorry to intrude but you hear how earnestly holmes insist that i should not leave you and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor
sir henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile
my dear fellow say he holmes with all his wisdom do not foresee some things which have happen since i have be on the moor
you understand me
i be sure that you be the last man in the world who would wish to be a spoil sport
i must go out alone
it put me in a most awkward position
i be at a loss what to say or what to do and before i have make up my mind he pick up his cane and be go
but when i come to think the matter over my conscience reproach me bitterly for have on any pretext allow him to go out of my sight
i imagine what my feel would be if i have to return to you and to confess that some misfortune have occur through my disregard for your instructions
i assure you my cheek flush at the very think
it might not even now be too late to overtake him so i set off at once in the direction of merripit house
i hurry along the road at the top of my speed without see anything of sir henry until i come to the point where the moor path branch off
there fear that perhaps i have come in the wrong direction after all i mount a hill from which i could command a view the same hill which be cut into the dark quarry
thence i saw him at once
he be on the moor path about a quarter of a mile off and a lady be by his side who could only be miss stapleton
it be clear that there be already an understand between them and that they have meet by appointment
they be walk slowly along in deep conversation and i saw her make quick little movements of her hand as if she be very earnest in what she be say while he listen intently and once or twice shake his head in strong dissent
i stand among the rock watch them very much puzzle as to what i should do next
to follow them and break into their intimate conversation seem to be an outrage and yet my clear duty be never for an instant to let him out of my sight
to act the spy upon a friend be a hateful task
still i could see no better course than to observe him from the hill and to clear my conscience by confess to him afterwards what i have do
it be true that if any sudden danger have threaten him i be too far away to be of use and yet i be sure that you will agree with me that the position be very difficult and that there be nothing more which i could do
our friend sir henry and the lady have halt on the path and be stand deeply absorb in their conversation when i be suddenly aware that i be not the only witness of their interview
a wisp of green float in the air catch my eye and another glance show me that it be carry on a stick by a man who be move among the break grind
it be stapleton with his butterfly net
he be very much closer to the pair than i be and he appear to be move in their direction
at this instant sir henry suddenly draw miss stapleton to his side
his arm be round her but it seem to me that she be strain away from him with her face avert
he stoop his head to hers and she raise one hand as if in protest
next moment i saw them spring apart and turn hurriedly round
stapleton be the cause of the interruption
he be run wildly towards them his absurd net dangle behind him
he gesticulate and almost dance with excitement in front of the lovers
what the scene mean i could not imagine but it seem to me that stapleton be abuse sir henry who offer explanations which become more angry as the other refuse to accept them
the lady stand by in haughty silence
finally stapleton turn upon his heel and beckon in a peremptory way to his sister who after an irresolute glance at sir henry walk off by the side of her brother
the naturalist's angry gesture show that the lady be include in his displeasure
the baronet stand for a minute look after them and then he walk slowly back the way that he have come his head hang the very picture of dejection
what all this mean i could not imagine but i be deeply ashamed to have witness so intimate a scene without my friend's knowledge
i run down the hill therefore and meet the baronet at the bottom
his face be flush with anger and his brows be wrinkle like one who be at his wit's end what to do
halloa watson
where have you drop from
say he
you don't mean to say that you come after me in spite of all
i explain everything to him how i have find it impossible to remain behind how i have follow him and how i have witness all that have occur
for an instant his eye blaze at me but my frankness disarm his anger and he break at last into a rather rueful laugh
you would have think the middle of that prairie a fairly safe place for a man to be private say he but by thunder the whole countryside seem to have be out to see me do my woo and a mighty poor woo at that
where have you engage a seat
i be on that hill
quite in the back row eh
but her brother be well up to the front
do you see him come out on us
yes i do
do he ever strike you as be crazy this brother of hers
i can't say that he ever do
i dare say not
i always think him sane enough until today but you can take it from me that either he or i ought to be in a straitjacket
what's the matter with me anyhow
you've live near me for some weeks watson
tell me straight now
be there anything that would prevent me from make a good husband to a woman that i love
i should say not
he can't object to my worldly position so it must be myself that he have this down on
what have he against me
i never hurt man or woman in my life that i know of
and yet he would not so much as let me touch the tip of her finger
do he say so
that and a deal more
i tell you watson i've only know her these few weeks but from the first i just felt that she be make for me and she too she be happy when she be with me and that i'll swear
there's a light in a woman's eye that speak louder than word
but he have never let us get together and it be only today for the first time that i saw a chance of have a few word with her alone
she be glad to meet me but when she do it be not love that she would talk about and she wouldn't have let me talk about it either if she could have stop it
she keep come back to it that this be a place of danger and that she would never be happy until i have leave it
i tell her that since i have see her i be in no hurry to leave it and that if she really want me to go the only way to work it be for her to arrange to go with me
with that i offer in as many word to marry her but before she could answer down come this brother of hers run at us with a face on him like a madman
he be just white with rage and those light eye of his be blaze with fury
what be i do with the lady
how dare i offer her attentions which be distasteful to her
do i think that because i be a baronet i could do what i like
if he have not be her brother i should have know better how to answer him
as it be i tell him that my feel towards his sister be such as i be not ashamed of and that i hop that she might honour me by become my wife
that seem to make the matter no better so then i lose my temper too and i answer him rather more hotly than i should perhaps consider that she be stand by
so it end by his go off with her as you saw and here be i as badly puzzle a man as any in this county
just tell me what it all mean watson and i'll owe you more than ever i can hope to pay
i try one or two explanations but indeed i be completely puzzle myself
our friend's title his fortune his age his character and his appearance be all in his favour and i know nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which run in his family
that his advance should be reject so brusquely without any reference to the lady's own wish and that the lady should accept the situation without protest be very amaze
however our conjecture be set at rest by a visit from stapleton himself that very afternoon
he have come to offer apologies for his rudeness of the morning and after a long private interview with sir henry in his study the upshot of their conversation be that the breach be quite heal and that we be to dine at merripit house next friday as a sign of it
i don't say now that he isn't a crazy man say sir henry i can't forget the look in his eye when he run at me this morning but i must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he have do
do he give any explanation of his conduct
his sister be everything in his life he say
that be natural enough and i be glad that he should understand her value
they have always be together and accord to his account he have be a very lonely man with only her as a companion so that the think of lose her be really terrible to him
he have not understand he say that i be become attach to her but when he saw with his own eye that it be really so and that she might be take away from him it give him such a shock that for a time he be not responsible for what he say or do
he be very sorry for all that have pass and he recognize how foolish and how selfish it be that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life
if she have to leave him he have rather it be to a neighbour like myself than to anyone else
but in any case it be a blow to him and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself to meet it
he would withdraw all opposition upon his part if i would promise for three months to let the matter rest and to be content with cultivate the lady's friendship during that time without claim her love
this i promise and so the matter rest
so there be one of our small mysteries clear up
it be something to have touch bottom anywhere in this bog in which we be flounder
we know now why stapleton look with disfavour upon his sister's suitor even when that suitor be so eligible a one as sir henry
and now i pass on to another thread which i have extricate out of the tangle skein the mystery of the sob in the night of the tear stain face of mrs
barrymore of the secret journey of the butler to the western lattice window
congratulate me my dear holmes and tell me that i have not disappoint you as an agent that you do not regret the confidence which you show in me when you send me down
all these things have by one night's work be thoroughly clear
i have say by one night's work but in truth it be by two nights' work for on the first we draw entirely blank
i sit up with sir henry in his room until nearly three o'clock in the morning but no sound of any sort do we hear except the chime clock upon the stairs
it be a most melancholy vigil and end by each of us fall asleep in our chair
fortunately we be not discourage and we determine to try again
the next night we lower the lamp and sit smoke cigarettes without make the least sound
it be incredible how slowly the hours crawl by and yet we be help through it by the same sort of patient interest which the hunter must feel as he watch the trap into which he hop the game may wander
one strike and two and we have almost for the second time give it up in despair when in an instant we both sit bolt upright in our chair with all our weary sense keenly on the alert once more
we have hear the creak of a step in the passage
very stealthily we hear it pass along until it die away in the distance
then the baronet gently open his door and we set out in pursuit
already our man have go round the gallery and the corridor be all in darkness
softly we steal along until we have come into the other wing
we be just in time to catch a glimpse of the tall black beard figure his shoulder round as he tiptoe down the passage
then he pass through the same door as before and the light of the candle frame it in the darkness and shoot one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor
we shuffle cautiously towards it try every plank before we dare to put our whole weight upon it
we have take the precaution of leave our boot behind us but even so the old board snap and creak beneath our tread
sometimes it seem impossible that he should fail to hear our approach
however the man be fortunately rather deaf and he be entirely preoccupy in that which he be do
when at last we reach the door and peep through we find him crouch at the window candle in hand his white intent face press against the pane exactly as i have see him two nights before
we have arrange no plan of campaign but the baronet be a man to whom the most direct way be always the most natural
he walk into the room and as he do so barrymore spring up from the window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stand livid and tremble before us
his dark eye glare out of the white mask of his face be full of horror and astonishment as he gaze from sir henry to me
what be you do here barrymore
nothing sir
his agitation be so great that he could hardly speak and the shadow spring up and down from the shake of his candle
it be the window sir
i go round at night to see that they be fasten
on the second floor
yes sir all the windows
look here barrymore say sir henry sternly we have make up our mind to have the truth out of you so it will save you trouble to tell it sooner rather than later
come now
no lie
what be you do at that window
the fellow look at us in a helpless way and he wring his hand together like one who be in the last extremity of doubt and misery
i be do no harm sir
i be hold a candle to the window
and why be you hold a candle to the window
don't ask me sir henry don't ask me
i give you my word sir that it be not my secret and that i cannot tell it
if it concern no one but myself i would not try to keep it from you
a sudden idea occur to me and i take the candle from the tremble hand of the butler
he must have be hold it as a signal say i
let us see if there be any answer
i hold it as he have do and star out into the darkness of the night
vaguely i could discern the black bank of the tree and the lighter expanse of the moor for the moon be behind the cloud
and then i give a cry of exultation for a tiny pinpoint of yellow light have suddenly transfix the dark veil and glow steadily in the centre of the black square frame by the window
there it be
i cry
no no sir it be nothing nothing at all
the butler break in i assure you sir move your light across the window watson
cry the baronet
see the other move also
now you rascal do you deny that it be a signal
come speak up
who be your confederate out yonder and what be this conspiracy that be go on
the man's face become openly defiant
it be my business and not yours
i will not tell
then you leave my employment right away
very good sir
if i must i must
and you go in disgrace
by thunder you may well be ashamed of yourself
your family have live with mine for over a hundred years under this roof and here i find you deep in some dark plot against me
no no sir no not against you
it be a woman's voice and mrs
barrymore paler and more horror strike than her husband be stand at the door
her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt might have be comic be it not for the intensity of feel upon her face
we have to go eliza
this be the end of it
you can pack our things say the butler
oh john john have i bring you to this
it be my do sir henry all mine
he have do nothing except for my sake and because i ask him
speak out then
what do it mean
my unhappy brother be starve on the moor
we cannot let him perish at our very gate
the light be a signal to him that food be ready for him and his light out yonder be to show the spot to which to bring it
then your brother be the escape convict sir selden the criminal
that's the truth sir say barrymore
i say that it be not my secret and that i could not tell it to you
but now you have hear it and you will see that if there be a plot it be not against you
this then be the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at night and the light at the window
sir henry and i both star at the woman in amazement
be it possible that this stolidly respectable person be of the same blood as one of the most notorious criminals in the country
yes sir my name be selden and he be my younger brother
we humour him too much when he be a lad and give him his own way in everything until he come to think that the world be make for his pleasure and that he could do what he like in it
then as he grow older he meet wicked companion and the devil enter into him until he break my mother's heart and drag our name in the dirt
from crime to crime he sink lower and lower until it be only the mercy of god which have snatch him from the scaffold but to me sir he be always the little curly head boy that i have nurse and play with as an elder sister would
that be why he break prison sir
he know that i be here and that we could not refuse to help him
when he drag himself here one night weary and starve with the warders hard at his heel what could we do
we take him in and feed him and care for him
then you return sir and my brother think he would be safer on the moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry be over so he lay in hide there
but every second night we make sure if he be still there by put a light in the window and if there be an answer my husband take out some bread and meat to him
every day we hop that he be go but as long as he be there we could not desert him
that be the whole truth as i be an honest christian woman and you will see that if there be blame in the matter it do not lie with my husband but with me for whose sake he have do all that he have
the woman's word come with an intense earnestness which carry conviction with them
be this true barrymore
yes sir henry
every word of it
well i cannot blame you for stand by your own wife
forget what i have say
go to your room you two and we shall talk further about this matter in the morning
when they be go we look out of the window again
sir henry have fling it open and the cold night wind beat in upon our face
far away in the black distance there still glow that one tiny point of yellow light
i wonder he dare say sir henry
it may be so place as to be only visible from here
very likely
how far do you think it be
out by the cleave tor i think
not more than a mile or two off
hardly that
well it cannot be far if barrymore have to carry out the food to it
and he be wait this villain beside that candle
by thunder watson i be go out to take that man
the same think have cross my own mind
it be not as if the barrymores have take us into their confidence
their secret have be force from them
the man be a danger to the community an unmitigated scoundrel for whom there be neither pity nor excuse
we be only do our duty in take this chance of put him back where he could do no harm
with his brutal and violent nature others would have to pay the price if we hold our hand
any night for example our neighbour the stapletons might be attack by him and it may have be the think of this which make sir henry so keen upon the adventure
i will come say i
then get your revolver and put on your boot
the sooner we start the better as the fellow may put out his light and be off
in five minutes we be outside the door start upon our expedition
we hurry through the dark shrubbery amid the dull moan of the autumn wind and the rustle of the fall leave
the night air be heavy with the smell of damp and decay
now and again the moon peep out for an instant but cloud be drive over the face of the sky and just as we come out on the moor a thin rain begin to fall
the light still burn steadily in front
be you arm
i ask
i have a hunt crop
we must close in on him rapidly for he be say to be a desperate fellow
we shall take him by surprise and have him at our mercy before he can resist
i say watson say the baronet what would holmes say to this
how about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil be exalt
as if in answer to his word there rise suddenly out of the vast gloom of the moor that strange cry which i have already hear upon the border of the great grimpen mire
it come with the wind through the silence of the night a long deep mutter then a rise howl and then the sad moan in which it die away
again and again it sound the whole air throb with it strident wild and menace
the baronet catch my sleeve and his face glimmer white through the darkness
my god what's that watson
i don't know
it's a sound they have on the moor
i hear it once before
it die away and an absolute silence close in upon us
we stand strain our ears but nothing come
watson say the baronet it be the cry of a hound
my blood run cold in my vein for there be a break in his voice which tell of the sudden horror which have seize him
what do they call this sound
he ask
who
the folk on the countryside
oh they be ignorant people
why should you mind what they call it
tell me watson
what do they say of it
i hesitate but could not escape the question
they say it be the cry of the hound of the baskervilles
he groan and be silent for a few moments
a hound it be he say at last but it seem to come from miles away over yonder i think
it be hard to say whence it come
it rise and fell with the wind
isn't that the direction of the great grimpen mire
yes it be
well it be up there
come now watson didn't you think yourself that it be the cry of a hound
i be not a child
you need not fear to speak the truth
stapleton be with me when i hear it last
he say that it might be the call of a strange bird
no no it be a hound
my god can there be some truth in all these stories
be it possible that i be really in danger from so dark a cause
you don't believe it do you watson
no no
and yet it be one thing to laugh about it in london and it be another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear such a cry as that
and my uncle
there be the footprint of the hound beside him as he lay
it all fit together
i don't think that i be a coward watson but that sound seem to freeze my very blood
feel my hand
it be as cold as a block of marble
you'll be all right tomorrow
i don't think i'll get that cry out of my head
what do you advise that we do now
shall we turn back
no by thunder we have come out to get our man and we will do it
we after the convict and a hell hound as likely as not after us
come on
we'll see it through if all the fiends of the pit be loose upon the moor
we stumble slowly along in the darkness with the black loom of the craggy hill around us and the yellow speck of light burn steadily in front
there be nothing so deceptive as the distance of a light upon a pitch dark night and sometimes the glimmer seem to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes it might have be within a few yards of us
but at last we could see whence it come and then we know that we be indeed very close
a gutter candle be stick in a crevice of the rock which flank it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also to prevent it from be visible save in the direction of baskerville hall
a boulder of granite conceal our approach and crouch behind it we gaze over it at the signal light
it be strange to see this single candle burn there in the middle of the moor with no sign of life near it just the one straight yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it
what shall we do now
whisper sir henry
wait here
he must be near his light
let us see if we can get a glimpse of him
the word be hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him
over the rock in the crevice of which the candle burn there be thrust out an evil yellow face a terrible animal face all seam and score with vile passions
foul with mire with a bristle beard and hang with mat hair it might well have belong to one of those old savage who dwell in the burrow on the hillsides
the light beneath him be reflect in his small cunning eye which peer fiercely to right and leave through the darkness like a crafty and savage animal who have hear the step of the hunters
something have evidently arouse his suspicions
it may have be that barrymore have some private signal which we have neglect to give or the fellow may have have some other reason for think that all be not well but i could read his fear upon his wicked face
any instant he might dash out the light and vanish in the darkness
i spring forward therefore and sir henry do the same
at the same moment the convict scream out a curse at us and hurl a rock which splinter up against the boulder which have shelter us
i catch one glimpse of his short squat strongly build figure as he spring to his feet and turn to run
at the same moment by a lucky chance the moon break through the cloud
we rush over the brow of the hill and there be our man run with great speed down the other side spring over the stone in his way with the activity of a mountain goat
a lucky long shoot of my revolver might have cripple him but i have bring it only to defend myself if attack and not to shoot an unarm man who be run away
we be both swift runners and in fairly good train but we soon find that we have no chance of overtake him
we saw him for a long time in the moonlight until he be only a small speck move swiftly among the boulders upon the side of a distant hill
we run and run until we be completely blow but the space between us grow ever wider
finally we stop and sit pant on two rock while we watch him disappear in the distance
and it be at this moment that there occur a most strange and unexpected thing
we have rise from our rock and be turn to go home have abandon the hopeless chase
the moon be low upon the right and the jag pinnacle of a granite tor stand up against the lower curve of its silver disc
there outline as black as an ebony statue on that shin background i saw the figure of a man upon the tor
do not think that it be a delusion holmes
i assure you that i have never in my life see anything more clearly
as far as i could judge the figure be that of a tall thin man
he stand with his legs a little separate his arm fold his head bow as if he be brood over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which lay before him
he might have be the very spirit of that terrible place
it be not the convict
this man be far from the place where the latter have disappear
besides he be a much taller man
with a cry of surprise i point him out to the baronet but in the instant during which i have turn to grasp his arm the man be go
there be the sharp pinnacle of granite still cut the lower edge of the moon but its peak bore no trace of that silent and motionless figure
i wish to go in that direction and to search the tor but it be some distance away
the baronet's nerve be still quiver from that cry which recall the dark story of his family and he be not in the mood for fresh adventure
he have not see this lonely man upon the tor and could not feel the thrill which his strange presence and his command attitude have give to me
a warder no doubt say he
the moor have be thick with them since this fellow escape
well perhaps his explanation may be the right one but i should like to have some further proof of it
today we mean to communicate to the princetown people where they should look for their miss man but it be hard line that we have not actually have the triumph of bring him back as our own prisoner
such be the adventure of last night and you must acknowledge my dear holmes that i have do you very well in the matter of a report
much of what i tell you be no doubt quite irrelevant but still i feel that it be best that i should let you have all the facts and leave you to select for yourself those which will be of most service to you in help you to your conclusions
we be certainly make some progress
so far as the barrymores go we have find the motive of their action and that have clear up the situation very much
but the moor with its mysteries and its strange inhabitants remain as inscrutable as ever
perhaps in my next i may be able to throw some light upon this also
best of all would it be if you could come down to us
in any case you will hear from me again in the course of the next few days
so far i have be able to quote from the report which i have forward during these early days to sherlock holmes
now however i have arrive at a point in my narrative where i be compel to abandon this method and to trust once more to my recollections aid by the diary which i keep at the time
a few extract from the latter will carry me on to those scenes which be indelibly fix in every detail upon my memory
i proceed then from the morning which follow our abortive chase of the convict and our other strange experience upon the moor
october 16th
a dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain
the house be bank in with roll cloud which rise now and then to show the dreary curve of the moor with thin silver vein upon the side of the hill and the distant boulders gleam where the light strike upon their wet face
it be melancholy outside and in
the baronet be in a black reaction after the excitements of the night
i be conscious myself of a weight at my heart and a feel of impend danger ever present danger which be the more terrible because i be unable to define it
and have i not cause for such a feel
consider the long sequence of incidents which have all point to some sinister influence which be at work around us
there be the death of the last occupant of the hall fulfil so exactly the condition of the family legend and there be the repeat report from peasants of the appearance of a strange creature upon the moor
twice i have with my own ears hear the sound which resemble the distant bay of a hound
it be incredible impossible that it should really be outside the ordinary laws of nature
a spectral hound which leave material footmarks and fill the air with its howl be surely not to be think of
stapleton may fall in with such a superstition and mortimer also but if i have one quality upon earth it be common sense and nothing will persuade me to believe in such a thing
to do so would be to descend to the level of these poor peasants who be not content with a mere fiend dog but must need describe him with hell fire shoot from his mouth and eye
holmes would not listen to such fancy and i be his agent
but facts be facts and i have twice hear this cry upon the moor
suppose that there be really some huge hound loose upon it that would go far to explain everything
but where could such a hound lie conceal where do it get its food where do it come from how be it that no one saw it by day
it must be confess that the natural explanation offer almost as many difficulties as the other
and always apart from the hound there be the fact of the human agency in london the man in the cab and the letter which warn sir henry against the moor
this at least be real but it might have be the work of a protect friend as easily as of an enemy
where be that friend or enemy now
have he remain in london or have he follow us down here
could he could he be the stranger whom i saw upon the tor
it be true that i have have only the one glance at him and yet there be some things to which i be ready to swear
he be no one whom i have see down here and i have now meet all the neighbour
the figure be far taller than that of stapleton far thinner than that of frankland
barrymore it might possibly have be but we have leave him behind us and i be certain that he could not have follow us
a stranger then be still dog us just as a stranger dog us in london
we have never shake him off
if i could lay my hand upon that man then at last we might find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties
to this one purpose i must now devote all my energies
my first impulse be to tell sir henry all my plan
my second and wisest one be to play my own game and speak as little as possible to anyone
he be silent and distrait
his nerve have be strangely shake by that sound upon the moor
i will say nothing to add to his anxieties but i will take my own step to attain my own end
we have a small scene this morning after breakfast
barrymore ask leave to speak with sir henry and they be closet in his study some little time
sit in the billiard room i more than once hear the sound of voice raise and i have a pretty good idea what the point be which be under discussion
after a time the baronet open his door and call for me
barrymore consider that he have a grievance he say
he think that it be unfair on our part to hunt his brother in law down when he of his own free will have tell us the secret
the butler be stand very pale but very collect before us
i may have speak too warmly sir say he and if i have i be sure that i beg your pardon
at the same time i be very much surprise when i hear you two gentlemen come back this morning and learn that you have be chase selden
the poor fellow have enough to fight against without my put more upon his track
if you have tell us of your own free will it would have be a different thing say the baronet you only tell us or rather your wife only tell us when it be force from you and you could not help yourself
i didn't think you would have take advantage of it sir henry indeed i didn't
the man be a public danger
there be lonely house scatter over the moor and he be a fellow who would stick at nothing
you only want to get a glimpse of his face to see that
look at mr
stapleton's house for example with no one but himself to defend it
there's no safety for anyone until he be under lock and key
he'll break into no house sir
i give you my solemn word upon that
but he will never trouble anyone in this country again
i assure you sir henry that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have be make and he will be on his way to south america
for god's sake sir i beg of you not to let the police know that he be still on the moor
they have give up the chase there and he can lie quiet until the ship be ready for him
you can't tell on him without get my wife and me into trouble
i beg you sir to say nothing to the police
what do you say watson
i shrug my shoulder
if he be safely out of the country it would relieve the tax payer of a burden
but how about the chance of his hold someone up before he go
he would not do anything so mad sir
we have provide him with all that he can want
to commit a crime would be to show where he be hide
that be true say sir henry
well barrymore god bless you sir and thank you from my heart
it would have kill my poor wife have he be take again
i guess we be aid and abet a felony watson
but after what we have hear i don't feel as if i could give the man up so there be an end of it
all right barrymore you can go
with a few break word of gratitude the man turn but he hesitate and then come back
you've be so kind to us sir that i should like to do the best i can for you in return
i know something sir henry and perhaps i should have say it before but it be long after the inquest that i find it out
i've never breathe a word about it yet to mortal man
it's about poor sir charles's death
the baronet and i be both upon our feet
do you know how he die
no sir i don't know that
what then
i know why he be at the gate at that hour
it be to meet a woman
to meet a woman
he
yes sir
and the woman's name
i can't give you the name sir but i can give you the initial
her initial be l
l
how do you know this barrymore
well sir henry your uncle have a letter that morning
he have usually a great many letter for he be a public man and well know for his kind heart so that everyone who be in trouble be glad to turn to him
but that morning as it chance there be only this one letter so i take the more notice of it
it be from coombe tracey and it be address in a woman's hand
well
well sir i think no more of the matter and never would have do have it not be for my wife
only a few weeks ago she be clean out sir charles's study it have never be touch since his death and she find the ash of a burn letter in the back of the grate
the greater part of it be char to piece but one little slip the end of a page hang together and the write could still be read though it be gray on a black grind
it seem to us to be a postscript at the end of the letter and it say 'please please as you be a gentleman burn this letter and be at the gate by ten o clock
beneath it be sign the initial l
l
have you get that slip
no sir it crumble all to bits after we move it
have sir charles receive any other letter in the same write
well sir i take no particular notice of his letter
i should not have notice this one only it happen to come alone
and you have no idea who l l
be
no sir
no more than you have
but i expect if we could lay our hand upon that lady we should know more about sir charles's death
i cannot understand barrymore how you come to conceal this important information
well sir it be immediately after that our own trouble come to us
and then again sir we be both of us very fond of sir charles as we well might be consider all that he have do for us
to rake this up couldn't help our poor master and it's well to go carefully when there's a lady in the case
even the best of us you think it might injure his reputation
well sir i think no good could come of it
but now you have be kind to us and i feel as if it would be treat you unfairly not to tell you all that i know about the matter
very good barrymore you can go
when the butler have leave us sir henry turn to me
well watson what do you think of this new light
it seem to leave the darkness rather blacker than before
so i think
but if we can only trace l l it should clear up the whole business
we have gain that much
we know that there be someone who have the facts if we can only find her
what do you think we should do
let holmes know all about it at once
it will give him the clue for which he have be seek
i be much mistake if it do not bring him down
i go at once to my room and draw up my report of the morning's conversation for holmes
it be evident to me that he have be very busy of late for the note which i have from baker street be few and short with no comment upon the information which i have supply and hardly any reference to my mission
no doubt his blackmail case be absorb all his faculties
and yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his interest
i wish that he be here
october 17th
all day today the rain pour down rustle on the ivy and drip from the eaves
i think of the convict out upon the bleak cold shelterless moor
poor devil
whatever his crimes he have suffer something to atone for them
and then i think of that other one the face in the cab the figure against the moon
be he also out in that deluge the unseen watcher the man of darkness
in the even i put on my waterproof and i walk far upon the sodden moor full of dark imagine the rain beat upon my face and the wind whistle about my ears
god help those who wander into the great mire now for even the firm uplands be become a morass
i find the black tor upon which i have see the solitary watcher and from its craggy summit i look out myself across the melancholy down
rain squall drift across their russet face and the heavy slate colour cloud hang low over the landscape trail in gray wreaths down the side of the fantastic hill
in the distant hollow on the leave half hide by the mist the two thin tower of baskerville hall rise above the tree
they be the only sign of human life which i could see save only those prehistoric huts which lay thickly upon the slop of the hill
nowhere be there any trace of that lonely man whom i have see on the same spot two nights before
as i walk back i be overtake by dr
mortimer drive in his dog cart over a rough moorland track which lead from the outlying farmhouse of foulmire
he have be very attentive to us and hardly a day have pass that he have not call at the hall to see how we be get on
he insist upon my climb into his dog cart and he give me a lift homeward
i find him much trouble over the disappearance of his little spaniel
it have wander on to the moor and have never come back
i give him such consolation as i might but i think of the pony on the grimpen mire and i do not fancy that he will see his little dog again
by the way mortimer say i as we jolt along the rough road i suppose there be few people live within drive distance of this whom you do not know
hardly any i think
can you then tell me the name of any woman whose initial be l
l
he think for a few minutes
no say he
there be a few gipsies and labour folk for whom i can't answer but among the farmers or gentry there be no one whose initial be those
wait a bite though he add after a pause
there be laura lyons her initial be l
l but she live in coombe tracey
who be she
i ask
she be frankland's daughter
what
old frankland the crank
exactly
she marry an artist name lyons who come sketch on the moor
he prove to be a blackguard and desert her
the fault from what i hear may not have be entirely on one side
her father refuse to have anything to do with her because she have marry without his consent and perhaps for one or two other reason as well
so between the old sinner and the young one the girl have have a pretty bad time
how do she live
i fancy old frankland allow her a pittance but it cannot be more for his own affairs be considerably involve
whatever she may have deserve one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the bad
her story get about and several of the people here do something to enable her to earn an honest live
stapleton do for one and sir charles for another
i give a trifle myself
it be to set her up in a typewrite business
he want to know the object of my inquiries but i manage to satisfy his curiosity without tell him too much for there be no reason why we should take anyone into our confidence
tomorrow morning i shall find my way to coombe tracey and if i can see this mrs
laura lyons of equivocal reputation a long step will have be make towards clear one incident in this chain of mysteries
i be certainly develop the wisdom of the serpent for when mortimer press his question to an inconvenient extent i ask him casually to what type frankland's skull belong and so hear nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive
i have not live for years with sherlock holmes for nothing
i have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and melancholy day
this be my conversation with barrymore just now which give me one more strong card which i can play in due time
mortimer have stay to dinner and he and the baronet play ecarte afterwards
the butler bring me my coffee into the library and i take the chance to ask him a few question
well say i have this precious relation of yours depart or be he still lurk out yonder
i don't know sir
i hope to heaven that he have go for he have bring nothing but trouble here
i've not hear of him since i leave out food for him last and that be three days ago
do you see him then
no sir but the food be go when next i go that way
then he be certainly there
so you would think sir unless it be the other man who take it
i sit with my coffee cup halfway to my lips and star at barrymore
you know that there be another man then
yes sir there be another man upon the moor
have you see him
no sir
how do you know of him then
selden tell me of him sir a week ago or more
he's in hide too but he's not a convict as far as i can make out
i don't like it dr
watson i tell you straight sir that i don't like it
he speak with a sudden passion of earnestness
now listen to me barrymore
i have no interest in this matter but that of your master
i have come here with no object except to help him
tell me frankly what it be that you don't like
barrymore hesitate for a moment as if he regret his outburst or find it difficult to express his own feel in word
it's all these go on sir he cry at last wave his hand towards the rain lash window which face the moor
there's foul play somewhere and there's black villainy brew to that i'll swear
very glad i should be sir to see sir henry on his way back to london again
but what be it that alarm you
look at sir charles's death
that be bad enough for all that the coroner say
look at the noise on the moor at night
there's not a man would cross it after sundown if he be pay for it
look at this stranger hide out yonder and watch and wait
what's he wait for
what do it mean
it mean no good to anyone of the name of baskerville and very glad i shall be to be quit of it all on the day that sir henry's new servants be ready to take over the hall
but about this stranger say i
can you tell me anything about him
what do selden say
do he find out where he hide or what he be do
he saw him once or twice but he be a deep one and give nothing away
at first he think that he be the police but soon he find that he have some lay of his own
a kind of gentleman he be as far as he could see but what he be do he could not make out
and where do he say that he live
among the old house on the hillside the stone huts where the old folk use to live
but how about his food
selden find out that he have get a lad who work for him and bring all he need
i dare say he go to coombe tracey for what he want
very good barrymore
we may talk further of this some other time
when the butler have go i walk over to the black window and i look through a blur pane at the drive cloud and at the toss outline of the wind sweep tree
it be a wild night indoors and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor
what passion of hatred can it be which lead a man to lurk in such a place at such a time
and what deep and earnest purpose can he have which call for such a trial
there in that hut upon the moor seem to lie the very centre of that problem which have vex me so sorely
i swear that another day shall not have pass before i have do all that man can do to reach the heart of the mystery
the extract from my private diary which form the last chapter have bring my narrative up to the eighteenth of october a time when these strange events begin to move swiftly towards their terrible conclusion
the incidents of the next few days be indelibly grave upon my recollection and i can tell them without reference to the note make at the time
i start them from the day which succeed that upon which i have establish two facts of great importance the one that mrs
laura lyons of coombe tracey have write to sir charles baskerville and make an appointment with him at the very place and hour that he meet his death the other that the lurk man upon the moor be to be find among the stone huts upon the hillside
with these two facts in my possession i felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be deficient if i could not throw some further light upon these dark place
i have no opportunity to tell the baronet what i have learn about mrs
lyons upon the even before for dr
mortimer remain with him at card until it be very late
at breakfast however i inform him about my discovery and ask him whether he would care to accompany me to coombe tracey
at first he be very eager to come but on second thoughts it seem to both of us that if i go alone the result might be better
the more formal we make the visit the less information we might obtain
i leave sir henry behind therefore not without some prick of conscience and drive off upon my new quest
when i reach coombe tracey i tell perkins to put up the horse and i make inquiries for the lady whom i have come to interrogate
i have no difficulty in find her room which be central and well appoint
a maid show me in without ceremony and as i enter the sit room a lady who be sit before a remington typewriter spring up with a pleasant smile of welcome
her face fell however when she saw that i be a stranger and she sit down again and ask me the object of my visit
the first impression leave by mrs
lyons be one of extreme beauty
her eye and hair be of the same rich hazel colour and her cheek though considerably freckle be flush with the exquisite bloom of the brunette the dainty pink which lurk at the heart of the sulphur rise
admiration be i repeat the first impression
but the second be criticism
there be something subtly wrong with the face some coarsen of expression some hardness perhaps of eye some loosen of lip which mar its perfect beauty
but these of course be afterthoughts
at the moment i be simply conscious that i be in the presence of a very handsome woman and that she be ask me the reason for my visit
i have not quite understand until that instant how delicate my mission be
i have the pleasure say i of know your father
it be a clumsy introduction and the lady make me feel it
there be nothing in common between my father and me she say
i owe him nothing and his friends be not mine
if it be not for the late sir charles baskerville and some other kind hearts i might have starve for all that my father care
it be about the late sir charles baskerville that i have come here to see you
the freckle start out on the lady's face
what can i tell you about him
she ask and her finger play nervously over the stop of her typewriter
you know him do you not
i have already say that i owe a great deal to his kindness
if i be able to support myself it be largely due to the interest which he take in my unhappy situation
do you correspond with him
the lady look quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eye
what be the object of these question
she ask sharply
the object be to avoid a public scandal
it be better that i should ask them here than that the matter should pass outside our control
she be silent and her face be still very pale
at last she look up with something reckless and defiant in her manner
well i'll answer she say
what be your question
do you correspond with sir charles
i certainly write to him once or twice to acknowledge his delicacy and his generosity
have you the date of those letter
no
have you ever meet him
yes once or twice when he come into coombe tracey
he be a very retire man and he prefer to do good by stealth
but if you saw him so seldom and write so seldom how do he know enough about your affairs to be able to help you as you say that he have do
she meet my difficulty with the utmost readiness
there be several gentlemen who know my sad history and unite to help me
one be mr
stapleton a neighbour and intimate friend of sir charles's
he be exceedingly kind and it be through him that sir charles learn about my affairs
i know already that sir charles baskerville have make stapleton his almoner upon several occasion so the lady's statement bore the impress of truth upon it
do you ever write to sir charles ask him to meet you
i continue
mrs
lyons flush with anger again
really sir this be a very extraordinary question
i be sorry madam but i must repeat it
then i answer certainly not
not on the very day of sir charles's death
the flush have fade in an instant and a deathly face be before me
her dry lips could not speak the no which i saw rather than hear
surely your memory deceive you say i
i could even quote a passage of your letter
it run 'please please as you be a gentleman burn this letter and be at the gate by ten o'clock '
i think that she have faint but she recover herself by a supreme effort
be there no such thing as a gentleman
she gasp
you do sir charles an injustice
he do burn the letter
but sometimes a letter may be legible even when burn
you acknowledge now that you write it
yes i do write it she cry pour out her soul in a torrent of word
i do write it
why should i deny it
i have no reason to be ashamed of it
i wish him to help me
i believe that if i have an interview i could gain his help so i ask him to meet me
but why at such an hour
because i have only just learn that he be go to london next day and might be away for months
there be reason why i could not get there earlier
but why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the house
do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor's house
well what happen when you do get there
i never go
mrs
lyons
no i swear it to you on all i hold sacred
i never go
something intervene to prevent my go
what be that
that be a private matter
i cannot tell it
you acknowledge then that you make an appointment with sir charles at the very hour and place at which he meet his death but you deny that you keep the appointment
that be the truth
again and again i cross question her but i could never get past that point
mrs
lyons say i as i rise from this long and inconclusive interview you be take a very great responsibility and put yourself in a very false position by not make an absolutely clean breast of all that you know
if i have to call in the aid of the police you will find how seriously you be compromise
if your position be innocent why do you in the first instance deny have write to sir charles upon that date
because i fear that some false conclusion might be draw from it and that i might find myself involve in a scandal
and why be you so press that sir charles should destroy your letter
if you have read the letter you will know
i do not say that i have read all the letter
you quote some of it
i quote the postscript
the letter have as i say be burn and it be not all legible
i ask you once again why it be that you be so press that sir charles should destroy this letter which he receive on the day of his death
the matter be a very private one
the more reason why you should avoid a public investigation
i will tell you then
if you have hear anything of my unhappy history you will know that i make a rash marriage and have reason to regret it
i have hear so much
my life have be one incessant persecution from a husband whom i abhor
the law be upon his side and every day i be face by the possibility that he may force me to live with him
at the time that i write this letter to sir charles i have learn that there be a prospect of my regain my freedom if certain expense could be meet
it mean everything to me peace of mind happiness self respect everything
i know sir charles's generosity and i think that if he hear the story from my own lips he would help me
then how be it that you do not go
because i receive help in the interval from another source
why then do you not write to sir charles and explain this
so i should have do have i not see his death in the paper next morning
the woman's story hang coherently together and all my question be unable to shake it
i could only check it by find if she have indeed institute divorce proceed against her husband at or about the time of the tragedy
it be unlikely that she would dare to say that she have not be to baskerville hall if she really have be for a trap would be necessary to take her there and could not have return to coombe tracey until the early hours of the morning
such an excursion could not be keep secret
the probability be therefore that she be tell the truth or at least a part of the truth
i come away baffle and dishearten
once again i have reach that dead wall which seem to be build across every path by which i try to get at the object of my mission
and yet the more i think of the lady's face and of her manner the more i felt that something be be hold back from me
why should she turn so pale
why should she fight against every admission until it be force from her
why should she have be so reticent at the time of the tragedy
surely the explanation of all this could not be as innocent as she would have me believe
for the moment i could proceed no farther in that direction but must turn back to that other clue which be to be seek for among the stone huts upon the moor
and that be a most vague direction
i realize it as i drive back and note how hill after hill show trace of the ancient people
barrymore's only indication have be that the stranger live in one of these abandon huts and many hundreds of them be scatter throughout the length and breadth of the moor
but i have my own experience for a guide since it have show me the man himself stand upon the summit of the black tor
that then should be the centre of my search
from there i should explore every hut upon the moor until i light upon the right one
if this man be inside it i should find out from his own lips at the point of my revolver if necessary who he be and why he have dog us so long
he might slip away from us in the crowd of regent street but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor
on the other hand if i should find the hut and its tenant should not be within it i must remain there however long the vigil until he return
holmes have miss him in london
it would indeed be a triumph for me if i could run him to earth where my master have fail
luck have be against us again and again in this inquiry but now at last it come to my aid
and the messenger of good fortune be none other than mr
frankland who be stand gray whisker and red face outside the gate of his garden which open on to the highroad along which i travel
good day dr
watson cry he with unwonted good humour you must really give your horse a rest and come in to have a glass of wine and to congratulate me
my feel towards him be very far from be friendly after what i have hear of his treatment of his daughter but i be anxious to send perkins and the wagonette home and the opportunity be a good one
i alight and send a message to sir henry that i should walk over in time for dinner
then i follow frankland into his din room
it be a great day for me sir one of the red letter days of my life he cry with many chuckle
i have bring off a double event
i mean to teach them in these part that law be law and that there be a man here who do not fear to invoke it
i have establish a right of way through the centre of old middleton's park slap across it sir within a hundred yards of his own front door
what do you think of that
we'll teach these magnates that they cannot ride roughshod over the right of the commoners confound them
and i've close the wood where the fernworthy folk use to picnic
these infernal people seem to think that there be no right of property and that they can swarm where they like with their paper and their bottle
both case decide dr
watson and both in my favour
i haven't have such a day since i have sir john morland for trespass because he shoot in his own warren
how on earth do you do that
look it up in the book sir
it will repay read frankland v morland court of queen's bench
it cost me pound but i get my verdict
do it do you any good
none sir none
i be proud to say that i have no interest in the matter
i act entirely from a sense of public duty
i have no doubt for example that the fernworthy people will burn me in effigy tonight
i tell the police last time they do it that they should stop these disgraceful exhibitions
the county constabulary be in a scandalous state sir and it have not afford me the protection to which i be entitle
the case of frankland v regina will bring the matter before the attention of the public
i tell them that they would have occasion to regret their treatment of me and already my word have come true
how so
i ask
the old man put on a very know expression
because i could tell them what they be die to know but nothing would induce me to help the rascals in any way
i have be cast round for some excuse by which i could get away from his gossip but now i begin to wish to hear more of it
i have see enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong sign of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences
some poach case no doubt
say i with an indifferent manner
ha ha my boy a very much more important matter than that
what about the convict on the moor
i star
you don't mean that you know where he be
say i
i may not know exactly where he be but i be quite sure that i could help the police to lay their hand on him
have it never strike you that the way to catch that man be to find out where he get his food and so trace it to him
he certainly seem to be get uncomfortably near the truth
no doubt say i but how do you know that he be anywhere upon the moor
i know it because i have see with my own eye the messenger who take him his food
my heart sink for barrymore
it be a serious thing to be in the power of this spiteful old busybody
but his next remark take a weight from my mind
you'll be surprise to hear that his food be take to him by a child
i see him every day through my telescope upon the roof
he pass along the same path at the same hour and to whom should he be go except to the convict
here be luck indeed
and yet i suppress all appearance of interest
a child
barrymore have say that our unknown be supply by a boy
it be on his track and not upon the convict's that frankland have stumble
if i could get his knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt
but incredulity and indifference be evidently my strongest card
i should say that it be much more likely that it be the son of one of the moorland shepherd take out his father's dinner
the least appearance of opposition strike fire out of the old autocrat
his eye look malignantly at me and his gray whisker bristle like those of an angry cat
indeed sir
say he point out over the wide stretch moor
do you see that black tor over yonder
well do you see the low hill beyond with the thornbush upon it
it be the stoniest part of the whole moor
be that a place where a shepherd would be likely to take his station
your suggestion sir be a most absurd one
i meekly answer that i have speak without know all the facts
my submission please him and lead him to further confidences
you may be sure sir that i have very good ground before i come to an opinion
i have see the boy again and again with his bundle
every day and sometimes twice a day i have be able but wait a moment dr
watson
do my eye deceive me or be there at the present moment something move upon that hillside
it be several miles off but i could distinctly see a small dark dot against the dull green and gray
come sir come
cry frankland rush upstairs
you will see with your own eye and judge for yourself
the telescope a formidable instrument mount upon a tripod stand upon the flat lead of the house
frankland clap his eye to it and give a cry of satisfaction
quick dr
watson quick before he pass over the hill
there he be sure enough a small urchin with a little bundle upon his shoulder toil slowly up the hill
when he reach the crest i saw the rag uncouth figure outline for an instant against the cold blue sky
he look round him with a furtive and stealthy air as one who dread pursuit
then he vanish over the hill
well
be i right
certainly there be a boy who seem to have some secret errand
and what the errand be even a county constable could guess
but not one word shall they have from me and i bind you to secrecy also dr
watson
not a word
you understand
just as you wish
they have treat me shamefully shamefully
when the facts come out in frankland v regina i venture to think that a thrill of indignation will run through the country
nothing would induce me to help the police in any way
for all they care it might have be me instead of my effigy which these rascals burn at the stake
surely you be not go
you will help me to empty the decanter in honour of this great occasion
but i resist all his solicitations and succeed in dissuade him from his announce intention of walk home with me
i keep the road as long as his eye be on me and then i strike off across the moor and make for the stony hill over which the boy have disappear
everything be work in my favour and i swear that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that i should miss the chance which fortune have throw in my way
the sun be already sink when i reach the summit of the hill and the long slop beneath me be all golden green on one side and gray shadow on the other
a haze lay low upon the farthest sky line out of which jut the fantastic shape of belliver and vixen tor
over the wide expanse there be no sound and no movement
one great gray bird a gull or curlew soar aloft in the blue heaven
he and i seem to be the only live things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath it
the barren scene the sense of loneliness and the mystery and urgency of my task all strike a chill into my heart
the boy be nowhere to be see
but down beneath me in a cleave of the hill there be a circle of the old stone huts and in the middle of them there be one which retain sufficient roof to act as a screen against the weather
my heart leap within me as i saw it
this must be the burrow where the stranger lurk
at last my foot be on the threshold of his hide place his secret be within my grasp
as i approach the hut walk as warily as stapleton would do when with poise net he draw near the settle butterfly i satisfy myself that the place have indeed be use as a habitation
a vague pathway among the boulders lead to the dilapidate open which serve as a door
all be silent within
the unknown might be lurk there or he might be prowl on the moor
my nerve tingle with the sense of adventure
throw aside my cigarette i close my hand upon the butt of my revolver and walk swiftly up to the door i look in
the place be empty
but there be ample sign that i have not come upon a false scent
this be certainly where the man live
some blanket roll in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which neolithic man have once slumber
the ash of a fire be heap in a rude grate
beside it lay some cook utensils and a bucket half full of water
a litter of empty tin show that the place have be occupy for some time and i saw as my eye become accustom to the checker light a pannikin and a half full bottle of spirit stand in the corner
in the middle of the hut a flat stone serve the purpose of a table and upon this stand a small cloth bundle the same no doubt which i have see through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy
it contain a loaf of bread a tin tongue and two tin of preserve peach
as i set it down again after have examine it my heart leap to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with write upon it
i raise it and this be what i read roughly scrawl in pencil dr
watson have go to coombe tracey
for a minute i stand there with the paper in my hand think out the mean of this curt message
it be i then and not sir henry who be be dog by this secret man
he have not follow me himself but he have set an agent the boy perhaps upon my track and this be his report
possibly i have take no step since i have be upon the moor which have not be observe and report
always there be this feel of an unseen force a fine net draw round us with infinite skill and delicacy hold us so lightly that it be only at some supreme moment that one realize that one be indeed entangle in its mesh
if there be one report there might be others so i look round the hut in search of them
there be no trace however of anything of the kind nor could i discover any sign which might indicate the character or intentions of the man who live in this singular place save that he must be of spartan habit and care little for the comfort of life
when i think of the heavy rain and look at the gap roof i understand how strong and immutable must be the purpose which have keep him in that inhospitable abide
be he our malignant enemy or be he by chance our guardian angel
i swear that i would not leave the hut until i know
outside the sun be sink low and the west be blaze with scarlet and gold
its reflection be shoot back in ruddy patch by the distant pool which lay amid the great grimpen mire
there be the two tower of baskerville hall and there a distant blur of smoke which mark the village of grimpen
between the two behind the hill be the house of the stapletons
all be sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden even light and yet as i look at them my soul share none of the peace of nature but quiver at the vagueness and the terror of that interview which every instant be bring nearer
with tingle nerve but a fix purpose i sit in the dark recess of the hut and wait with sombre patience for the come of its tenant
and then at last i hear him
far away come the sharp clink of a boot strike upon a stone
then another and yet another come nearer and nearer
i shrink back into the darkest corner and cock the pistol in my pocket determine not to discover myself until i have an opportunity of see something of the stranger
there be a long pause which show that he have stop
then once more the footsteps approach and a shadow fell across the open of the hut
it be a lovely even my dear watson say a well know voice
i really think that you will be more comfortable outside than in
for a moment or two i sit breathless hardly able to believe my ears
then my sense and my voice come back to me while a crush weight of responsibility seem in an instant to be lift from my soul
that cold incisive ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world
holmes
i cry holmes
come out say he and please be careful with the revolver
i stoop under the rude lintel and there he sit upon a stone outside his gray eye dance with amusement as they fell upon my astonish feature
he be thin and wear but clear and alert his keen face bronze by the sun and roughen by the wind
in his tweed suit and cloth cap he look like any other tourist upon the moor and he have contrive with that catlike love of personal cleanliness which be one of his characteristics that his chin should be as smooth and his linen as perfect as if he be in baker street
i never be more glad to see anyone in my life say i as i wring him by the hand
or more astonish eh
well i must confess to it
the surprise be not all on one side i assure you
i have no idea that you have find my occasional retreat still less that you be inside it until i be within twenty pace of the door
my footprint i presume
no watson i fear that i could not undertake to recognize your footprint amid all the footprints of the world
if you seriously desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist for when i see the stub of a cigarette mark bradley oxford street i know that my friend watson be in the neighbourhood
you will see it there beside the path
you throw it down no doubt at that supreme moment when you charge into the empty hut
exactly
i think as much and know your admirable tenacity i be convince that you be sit in ambush a weapon within reach wait for the tenant to return
so you actually think that i be the criminal
i do not know who you be but i be determine to find out
excellent watson
and how do you localize me
you saw me perhaps on the night of the convict hunt when i be so imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me
yes i saw you then
and have no doubt search all the huts until you come to this one
no your boy have be observe and that give me a guide where to look
the old gentleman with the telescope no doubt
i could not make it out when first i saw the light flash upon the lens
he rise and peep into the hut
ha i see that cartwright have bring up some supply
what's this paper
so you have be to coombe tracey have you
yes
to see mrs
laura lyons
exactly
well do
our research have evidently be run on parallel line and when we unite our result i expect we shall have a fairly full knowledge of the case
well i be glad from my heart that you be here for indeed the responsibility and the mystery be both become too much for my nerve
but how in the name of wonder do you come here and what have you be do
i think that you be in baker street work out that case of blackmail
that be what i wish you to think
then you use me and yet do not trust me
i cry with some bitterness
i think that i have deserve better at your hand holmes
my dear fellow you have be invaluable to me in this as in many other case and i beg that you will forgive me if i have seem to play a trick upon you
in truth it be partly for your own sake that i do it and it be my appreciation of the danger which you run which lead me to come down and examine the matter for myself
have i be with sir henry and you it be confident that my point of view would have be the same as yours and my presence would have warn our very formidable opponents to be on their guard
as it be i have be able to get about as i could not possibly have do have i be live in the hall and i remain an unknown factor in the business ready to throw in all my weight at a critical moment
but why keep me in the dark
for you to know could not have help us and might possibly have lead to my discovery
you would have wish to tell me something or in your kindness you would have bring me out some comfort or other and so an unnecessary risk would be run
i bring cartwright down with me you remember the little chap at the express office and he have see after my simple want a loaf of bread and a clean collar
what do man want more
he have give me an extra pair of eye upon a very active pair of feet and both have be invaluable
then my report have all be waste
my voice tremble as i recall the pain and the pride with which i have compose them
holmes take a bundle of paper from his pocket
here be your report my dear fellow and very well thumb i assure you
i make excellent arrangements and they be only delay one day upon their way
i must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have show over an extraordinarily difficult case
i be still rather raw over the deception which have be practise upon me but the warmth of holmes's praise drive my anger from my mind
i felt also in my heart that he be right in what he say and that it be really best for our purpose that i should not have know that he be upon the moor
that's better say he see the shadow rise from my face
and now tell me the result of your visit to mrs
laura lyons it be not difficult for me to guess that it be to see her that you have go for i be already aware that she be the one person in coombe tracey who might be of service to us in the matter
in fact if you have not go today it be exceedingly probable that i should have go tomorrow
the sun have set and dusk be settle over the moor
the air have turn chill and we withdraw into the hut for warmth
there sit together in the twilight i tell holmes of my conversation with the lady
so interest be he that i have to repeat some of it twice before he be satisfy
this be most important say he when i have conclude
it fill up a gap which i have be unable to bridge in this most complex affair
you be aware perhaps that a close intimacy exist between this lady and the man stapleton
i do not know of a close intimacy
there can be no doubt about the matter
they meet they write there be a complete understand between them
now this put a very powerful weapon into our hand
if i could only use it to detach his wife his wife
i be give you some information now in return for all that you have give me
the lady who have pass here as miss stapleton be in reality his wife
good heavens holmes
be you sure of what you say
how could he have permit sir henry to fall in love with her
sir henry's fall in love could do no harm to anyone except sir henry
he take particular care that sir henry do not make love to her as you have yourself observe
i repeat that the lady be his wife and not his sister
but why this elaborate deception
because he foresee that she would be very much more useful to him in the character of a free woman
all my unspoken instincts my vague suspicions suddenly take shape and centre upon the naturalist
in that impassive colourless man with his straw hat and his butterfly net i seem to see something terrible a creature of infinite patience and craft with a smile face and a murderous heart
it be he then who be our enemy it be he who dog us in london
so i read the riddle
and the warn it must have come from her
exactly
the shape of some monstrous villainy half see half guess loom through the darkness which have gird me so long
but be you sure of this holmes
how do you know that the woman be his wife
because he so far forget himself as to tell you a true piece of autobiography upon the occasion when he first meet you and i dare say he have many a time regret it since
he be once a schoolmaster in the north of england
now there be no one more easy to trace than a schoolmaster
there be scholastic agencies by which one may identify any man who have be in the profession
a little investigation show me that a school have come to grief under atrocious circumstances and that the man who have own it the name be different have disappear with his wife
the descriptions agree
when i learn that the miss man be devote to entomology the identification be complete
the darkness be rise but much be still hide by the shadow
if this woman be in truth his wife where do mrs
laura lyons come in
i ask
that be one of the point upon which your own research have shed a light
your interview with the lady have clear the situation very much
i do not know about a project divorce between herself and her husband
in that case regard stapleton as an unmarried man she count no doubt upon become his wife
and when she be undeceive
why then we may find the lady of service
it must be our first duty to see her both of us tomorrow
don't you think watson that you be away from your charge rather long
your place should be at baskerville hall
the last red streak have fade away in the west and night have settle upon the moor
a few faint star be gleam in a violet sky
one last question holmes i say as i rise
surely there be no need of secrecy between you and me
what be the mean of it all
what be he after
holmes's voice sink as he answer it be murder watson refine cold blood deliberate murder
do not ask me for particulars
my net be close upon him even as his be upon sir henry and with your help he be already almost at my mercy
there be but one danger which can threaten us
it be that he should strike before we be ready to do so
another day two at the most and i have my case complete but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watch her ail child
your mission today have justify itself and yet i could almost wish that you have not leave his side
hark
a terrible scream a prolong yell of horror and anguish burst out of the silence of the moor
that frightful cry turn the blood to ice in my vein
oh my god
i gasp
what be it
what do it mean
holmes have spring to his feet and i saw his dark athletic outline at the door of the hut his shoulder stoop his head thrust forward his face peer into the darkness
hush
he whisper
hush
the cry have be loud on account of its vehemence but it have peal out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain
now it burst upon our ears nearer louder more urgent than before
where be it
holmes whisper and i know from the thrill of his voice that he the man of iron be shake to the soul
where be it watson
there i think
i point into the darkness
no there
again the agonize cry sweep through the silent night louder and much nearer than ever
and a new sound mingle with it a deep mutter rumble musical and yet menace rise and fall like the low constant murmur of the sea
the hound
cry holmes
come watson come
great heavens if we be too late
he have start run swiftly over the moor and i have follow at his heel
but now from somewhere among the break grind immediately in front of us there come one last despair yell and then a dull heavy thud
we halt and listen
not another sound break the heavy silence of the windless night
i saw holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distract
he stamp his feet upon the grind
he have beat us watson
we be too late
no no surely not
fool that i be to hold my hand
and you watson see what come of abandon your charge
but by heaven if the worst have happen we'll avenge him
blindly we run through the gloom blunder against boulders force our way through gorse bush pant up hill and rush down slop head always in the direction whence those dreadful sound have come
at every rise holmes look eagerly round him but the shadow be thick upon the moor and nothing move upon its dreary face
can you see anything
nothing
but hark what be that
a low moan have fall upon our ears
there it be again upon our leave
on that side a ridge of rock end in a sheer cliff which overlook a stone strew slope
on its jag face be spread eagle some dark irregular object
as we run towards it the vague outline harden into a definite shape
it be a prostrate man face downward upon the grind the head double under him at a horrible angle the shoulder round and the body hunch together as if in the act of throw a somersault
so grotesque be the attitude that i could not for the instant realize that that moan have be the pass of his soul
not a whisper not a rustle rise now from the dark figure over which we stoop
holmes lay his hand upon him and hold it up again with an exclamation of horror
the gleam of the match which he strike shine upon his clot finger and upon the ghastly pool which widen slowly from the crush skull of the victim
and it shine upon something else which turn our hearts sick and faint within us the body of sir henry baskerville
there be no chance of either of us forget that peculiar ruddy tweed suit the very one which he have wear on the first morning that we have see him in baker street
we catch the one clear glimpse of it and then the match flicker and go out even as the hope have go out of our souls
holmes groan and his face glimmer white through the darkness
the brute
the brute
i cry with clench hand
oh holmes i shall never forgive myself for have leave him to his fate
i be more to blame than you watson
in order to have my case well round and complete i have throw away the life of my client
it be the greatest blow which have befall me in my career
but how could i know how could i know that he would risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my warn
that we should have hear his scream my god those scream and yet have be unable to save him
where be this brute of a hound which drive him to his death
it may be lurk among these rock at this instant
and stapleton where be he
he shall answer for this deed
he shall
i will see to that
uncle and nephew have be murder the one frighten to death by the very sight of a beast which he think to be supernatural the other drive to his end in his wild flight to escape from it
but now we have to prove the connection between the man and the beast
save from what we hear we cannot even swear to the existence of the latter since sir henry have evidently die from the fall
but by heavens cunning as he be the fellow shall be in my power before another day be past
we stand with bitter hearts on either side of the mangle body overwhelm by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which have bring all our long and weary labour to so piteous an end
then as the moon rise we climb to the top of the rock over which our poor friend have fall and from the summit we gaze out over the shadowy moor half silver and half gloom
far away miles off in the direction of grimpen a single steady yellow light be shin
it could only come from the lonely abide of the stapletons
with a bitter curse i shake my fist at it as i gaze
why should we not seize him at once
our case be not complete
the fellow be wary and cunning to the last degree
it be not what we know but what we can prove
if we make one false move the villain may escape us yet
what can we do
there will be plenty for us to do tomorrow
tonight we can only perform the last offices to our poor friend
together we make our way down the precipitous slope and approach the body black and clear against the silver stone
the agony of those contort limbs strike me with a spasm of pain and blur my eye with tear
we must send for help holmes
we cannot carry him all the way to the hall
good heavens be you mad
he have utter a cry and bend over the body
now he be dance and laugh and wring my hand
could this be my stern self contain friend
these be hide fire indeed
a beard
a beard
the man have a beard
a beard
it be not the baronet it be why it be my neighbour the convict
with feverish haste we have turn the body over and that drip beard be point up to the cold clear moon
there could be no doubt about the beetle forehead the sink animal eye
it be indeed the same face which have glare upon me in the light of the candle from over the rock the face of selden the criminal
then in an instant it be all clear to me
i remember how the baronet have tell me that he have hand his old wardrobe to barrymore
barrymore have pass it on in order to help selden in his escape
boot shirt cap it be all sir henry's
the tragedy be still black enough but this man have at least deserve death by the laws of his country
i tell holmes how the matter stand my heart bubble over with thankfulness and joy
then the clothe have be the poor devil's death say he
it be clear enough that the hound have be lay on from some article of sir henry's the boot which be abstract in the hotel in all probability and so run this man down
there be one very singular thing however how come selden in the darkness to know that the hound be on his trail
he hear him
to hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture by scream wildly for help
by his cry he must have run a long way after he know the animal be on his track
how do he know
a greater mystery to me be why this hound presume that all our conjecture be correct i presume nothing
well then why this hound should be loose tonight
i suppose that it do not always run loose upon the moor
stapleton would not let it go unless he have reason to think that sir henry would be there
my difficulty be the more formidable of the two for i think that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours while mine may remain forever a mystery
the question now be what shall we do with this poor wretch's body
we cannot leave it here to the fox and the raven
i suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can communicate with the police
exactly
i have no doubt that you and i could carry it so far
halloa watson what's this
it's the man himself by all that's wonderful and audacious
not a word to show your suspicions not a word or my plan crumble to the grind
a figure be approach us over the moor and i saw the dull red glow of a cigar
the moon shine upon him and i could distinguish the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist
he stop when he saw us and then come on again
why dr
watson that's not you be it
you be the last man that i should have expect to see out on the moor at this time of night
but dear me what's this
somebody hurt
not don't tell me that it be our friend sir henry
he hurry past me and stoop over the dead man
i hear a sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fell from his finger
who who's this
he stammer
it be selden the man who escape from princetown
stapleton turn a ghastly face upon us but by a supreme effort he have overcome his amazement and his disappointment
he look sharply from holmes to me
dear me
what a very shock affair
how do he die
he appear to have break his neck by fall over these rock
my friend and i be stroll on the moor when we hear a cry
i hear a cry also
that be what bring me out
i be uneasy about sir henry
why about sir henry in particular
i could not help ask
because i have suggest that he should come over
when he do not come i be surprise and i naturally become alarm for his safety when i hear cry upon the moor
by the way his eye dart again from my face to holmes's do you hear anything else besides a cry
no say holmes do you
no
what do you mean then
oh you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom hound and so on
it be say to be hear at night upon the moor
i be wonder if there be any evidence of such a sound tonight
we hear nothing of the kind say i
and what be your theory of this poor fellow's death
i have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have drive him off his head
he have rush about the moor in a crazy state and eventually fall over here and break his neck
that seem the most reasonable theory say stapleton and he give a sigh which i take to indicate his relief
what do you think about it mr
sherlock holmes
my friend bow his compliment
you be quick at identification say he
we have be expect you in these part since dr
watson come down
you be in time to see a tragedy
yes indeed
i have no doubt that my friend's explanation will cover the facts
i will take an unpleasant remembrance back to london with me tomorrow
oh you return tomorrow
that be my intention
i hope your visit have cast some light upon those occurrences which have puzzle us
holmes shrug his shoulder
one cannot always have the success for which one hop
an investigator need facts and not legends or rumour
it have not be a satisfactory case
my friend speak in his frankest and most unconcerned manner
stapleton still look hard at him
then he turn to me
i would suggest carry this poor fellow to my house but it would give my sister such a fright that i do not feel justify in do it
i think that if we put something over his face he will be safe until morning
and so it be arrange
resist stapleton's offer of hospitality holmes and i set off to baskerville hall leave the naturalist to return alone
look back we saw the figure move slowly away over the broad moor and behind him that one black smudge on the silver slope which show where the man be lie who have come so horribly to his end
we're at close grip at last say holmes as we walk together across the moor
what a nerve the fellow have
how he pull himself together in the face of what must have be a paralyze shock when he find that the wrong man have fall a victim to his plot
i tell you in london watson and i tell you now again that we have never have a foeman more worthy of our steel
i be sorry that he have see you
and so be i at first
but there be no get out of it
what effect do you think it will have upon his plan now that he know you be here
it may cause him to be more cautious or it may drive him to desperate measure at once
like most clever criminals he may be too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he have completely deceive us
why should we not arrest him at once
my dear watson you be bear to be a man of action
your instinct be always to do something energetic
but suppose for argument's sake that we have him arrest tonight what on earth the better off should we be for that
we could prove nothing against him
there's the devilish cunning of it
if he be act through a human agent we could get some evidence but if we be to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not help us in put a rope round the neck of its master
surely we have a case
not a shadow of one only surmise and conjecture
we should be laugh out of court if we come with such a story and such evidence
there be sir charles's death
find dead without a mark upon him
you and i know that he die of sheer fright and we know also what frighten him but how be we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it
what sign be there of a hound
where be the mark of its fangs
of course we know that a hound do not bite a dead body and that sir charles be dead before ever the brute overtake him
but we have to prove all this and we be not in a position to do it
well then tonight
we be not much better off tonight
again there be no direct connection between the hound and the man's death
we never saw the hound
we hear it but we could not prove that it be run upon this man's trail
there be a complete absence of motive
no my dear fellow we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that we have no case at present and that it be worth our while to run any risk in order to establish one
and how do you propose to do so
i have great hop of what mrs
laura lyons may do for us when the position of affairs be make clear to her
and i have my own plan as well
sufficient for tomorrow be the evil thereof but i hope before the day be past to have the upper hand at last
i could draw nothing further from him and he walk lose in think as far as the baskerville gate
be you come up
yes i see no reason for further concealment
but one last word watson
say nothing of the hound to sir henry
let him think that selden's death be as stapleton would have us believe
he will have a better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo tomorrow when he be engage if i remember your report aright to dine with these people
and so be i
then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone
that will be easily arrange
and now if we be too late for dinner i think that we be both ready for our suppers
sir henry be more please than surprise to see sherlock holmes for he have for some days be expect that recent events would bring him down from london
he do raise his eyebrows however when he find that my friend have neither any luggage nor any explanations for its absence
between us we soon supply his want and then over a belated supper we explain to the baronet as much of our experience as it seem desirable that he should know
but first i have the unpleasant duty of break the news to barrymore and his wife
to him it may have be an unmitigated relief but she weep bitterly in her apron
to all the world he be the man of violence half animal and half demon but to her he always remain the little wilful boy of her own girlhood the child who have cling to her hand
evil indeed be the man who have not one woman to mourn him
i've be mop in the house all day since watson go off in the morning say the baronet
i guess i should have some credit for i have keep my promise
if i hadn't swear not to go about alone i might have have a more lively even for i have a message from stapleton ask me over there
i have no doubt that you would have have a more lively even say holmes drily
by the way i don't suppose you appreciate that we have be mourn over you as have break your neck
sir henry open his eye
how be that
this poor wretch be dress in your clothe
i fear your servant who give them to him may get into trouble with the police
that be unlikely
there be no mark on any of them as far as i know
that's lucky for him in fact it's lucky for all of you since you be all on the wrong side of the law in this matter
i be not sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty be not to arrest the whole household
watson's report be most incriminate document
but how about the case
ask the baronet
have you make anything out of the tangle
i don't know that watson and i be much the wiser since we come down
i think that i shall be in a position to make the situation rather more clear to you before long
it have be an exceedingly difficult and most complicate business
there be several point upon which we still want light but it be come all the same
we've have one experience as watson have no doubt tell you
we hear the hound on the moor so i can swear that it be not all empty superstition
i have something to do with dog when i be out west and i know one when i hear one
if you can muzzle that one and put him on a chain i'll be ready to swear you be the greatest detective of all time
i think i will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will give me your help
whatever you tell me to do i will do
very good and i will ask you also to do it blindly without always ask the reason
just as you like
if you will do this i think the chance be that our little problem will soon be solve
i have no doubt he stop suddenly and star fixedly up over my head into the air
the lamp beat upon his face and so intent be it and so still that it might have be that of a clear cut classical statue a personification of alertness and expectation
what be it
we both cry
i could see as he look down that he be repress some internal emotion
his feature be still compose but his eye shine with amuse exultation
excuse the admiration of a connoisseur say he as he wave his hand towards the line of portraits which cover the opposite wall
watson won't allow that i know anything of art but that be mere jealousy because our view upon the subject differ
now these be a really very fine series of portraits
well i'm glad to hear you say so say sir henry glance with some surprise at my friend
i don't pretend to know much about these things and i'd be a better judge of a horse or a steer than of a picture
i didn't know that you find time for such things
i know what be good when i see it and i see it now
that's a kneller i'll swear that lady in the blue silk over yonder and the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a reynolds
they be all family portraits i presume
every one
do you know the name
barrymore have be coach me in them and i think i can say my lessons fairly well
who be the gentleman with the telescope
that be rear admiral baskerville who serve under rodney in the west indies
the man with the blue coat and the roll of paper be sir william baskerville who be chairman of committees of the house of commons under pitt
and this cavalier opposite to me the one with the black velvet and the lace
ah you have a right to know about him
that be the cause of all the mischief the wicked hugo who start the hound of the baskervilles
we're not likely to forget him
i gaze with interest and some surprise upon the portrait
dear me
say holmes he seem a quiet meek mannered man enough but i dare say that there be a lurk devil in his eye
i have picture him as a more robust and ruffianly person
there's no doubt about the authenticity for the name and the date be on the back of the canvas
holmes say little more but the picture of the old roysterer seem to have a fascination for him and his eye be continually fix upon it during supper
it be not until later when sir henry have go to his room that i be able to follow the trend of his thoughts
he lead me back into the banquet hall his bedroom candle in his hand and he hold it up against the time stain portrait on the wall
do you see anything there
i look at the broad plume hat the curl love lock the white lace collar and the straight severe face which be frame between them
it be not a brutal countenance but it be prim hard and stern with a firm set thin lipped mouth and a coldly intolerant eye
be it like anyone you know
there be something of sir henry about the jaw
just a suggestion perhaps
but wait an instant
he stand upon a chair and hold up the light in his leave hand he curve his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets
good heavens
i cry in amazement
the face of stapleton have spring out of the canvas
ha you see it now
my eye have be train to examine face and not their trimmings
it be the first quality of a criminal investigator that he should see through a disguise
but this be marvellous
it might be his portrait
yes it be an interest instance of a throwback which appear to be both physical and spiritual
a study of family portraits be enough to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation
the fellow be a baskerville that be evident
with design upon the succession
exactly
this chance of the picture have supply us with one of our most obvious miss link
we have him watson we have him and i dare swear that before tomorrow night he will be flutter in our net as helpless as one of his own butterfly
a pin a cork and a card and we add him to the baker street collection
he burst into one of his rare fit of laughter as he turn away from the picture
i have not hear him laugh often and it have always bode ill to somebody
i be up betimes in the morning but holmes be afoot earlier still for i saw him as i dress come up the drive
yes we should have a full day today he remark and he rub his hand with the joy of action
the net be all in place and the drag be about to begin
we'll know before the day be out whether we have catch our big leanjawed pike or whether he have get through the mesh
have you be on the moor already
i have send a report from grimpen to princetown as to the death of selden
i think i can promise that none of you will be trouble in the matter
and i have also communicate with my faithful cartwright who would certainly have pin away at the door of my hut as a dog do at his master's grave if i have not set his mind at rest about my safety
what be the next move
to see sir henry
ah here he be
good morning holmes say the baronet
you look like a general who be plan a battle with his chief of the staff
that be the exact situation
watson be ask for order
and so do i
very good
you be engage as i understand to dine with our friends the stapletons tonight
i hope that you will come also
they be very hospitable people and i be sure that they would be very glad to see you
i fear that watson and i must go to london
to london
yes i think that we should be more useful there at the present juncture
the baronet's face perceptibly lengthen
i hop that you be go to see me through this business
the hall and the moor be not very pleasant place when one be alone
my dear fellow you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what i tell you
you can tell your friends that we should have be happy to have come with you but that urgent business require us to be in town
we hope very soon to return to devonshire
will you remember to give them that message
if you insist upon it
there be no alternative i assure you
i saw by the baronet's cloud brow that he be deeply hurt by what he regard as our desertion
when do you desire to go
he ask coldly
immediately after breakfast
we will drive in to coombe tracey but watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come back to you
watson you will send a note to stapleton to tell him that you regret that you cannot come
i have a good mind to go to london with you say the baronet
why should i stay here alone
because it be your post of duty
because you give me your word that you would do as you be tell and i tell you to stay
all right then i'll stay
one more direction
i wish you to drive to merripit house
send back your trap however and let them know that you intend to walk home
to walk across the moor
yes
but that be the very thing which you have so often caution me not to do
this time you may do it with safety
if i have not every confidence in your nerve and courage i would not suggest it but it be essential that you should do it
then i will do it
and as you value your life do not go across the moor in any direction save along the straight path which lead from merripit house to the grimpen road and be your natural way home
i will do just what you say
very good
i should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as possible so as to reach london in the afternoon
i be much astound by this programme though i remember that holmes have say to stapleton on the night before that his visit would terminate next day
it have not cross my mind however that he would wish me to go with him nor could i understand how we could both be absent at a moment which he himself declare to be critical
there be nothing for it however but implicit obedience so we bid good bye to our rueful friend and a couple of hours afterwards we be at the station of coombe tracey and have dispatch the trap upon its return journey
a small boy be wait upon the platform
any order sir
you will take this train to town cartwright
the moment you arrive you will send a wire to sir henry baskerville in my name to say that if he find the pocketbook which i have drop he be to send it by register post to baker street
yes sir
and ask at the station office if there be a message for me
the boy return with a telegram which holmes hand to me
it run wire receive
come down with unsigned warrant
arrive five forty
lestrade
that be in answer to mine of this morning
he be the best of the professionals i think and we may need his assistance
now watson i think that we cannot employ our time better than by call upon your acquaintance mrs
laura lyons
his plan of campaign be begin to be evident
he would use the baronet in order to convince the stapletons that we be really go while we should actually return at the instant when we be likely to be need
that telegram from london if mention by sir henry to the stapletons must remove the last suspicions from their mind
already i seem to see our net draw closer around that leanjawed pike
mrs
laura lyons be in her office and sherlock holmes open his interview with a frankness and directness which considerably amaze her
i be investigate the circumstances which attend the death of the late sir charles baskerville say he
my friend here dr
watson have inform me of what you have communicate and also of what you have withhold in connection with that matter
what have i withhold
she ask defiantly
you have confess that you ask sir charles to be at the gate at ten o'clock
we know that that be the place and hour of his death
you have withhold what the connection be between these events
there be no connection
in that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one
but i think that we shall succeed in establish a connection after all
i wish to be perfectly frank with you mrs
lyons
we regard this case as one of murder and the evidence may implicate not only your friend mr
stapleton but his wife as well
the lady spring from her chair
his wife
she cry
the fact be no longer a secret
the person who have pass for his sister be really his wife
mrs
lyons have resume her seat
her hand be grasp the arm of her chair and i saw that the pink nail have turn white with the pressure of her grip
his wife
she say again
his wife
he be not a marry man
sherlock holmes shrug his shoulder
prove it to me
prove it to me
and if you can do so
the fierce flash of her eye say more than any word
i have come prepare to do so say holmes draw several paper from his pocket
here be a photograph of the couple take in york four years ago
it be indorse 'mr
and mrs
vandeleur ' but you will have no difficulty in recognize him and her also if you know her by sight
here be three write descriptions by trustworthy witness of mr
and mrs
vandeleur who at that time keep st
oliver's private school
read them and see if you can doubt the identity of these people
she glance at them and then look up at us with the set rigid face of a desperate woman
mr
holmes she say this man have offer me marriage on condition that i could get a divorce from my husband
he have lie to me the villain in every conceivable way
not one word of truth have he ever tell me
and why why
i imagine that all be for my own sake
but now i see that i be never anything but a tool in his hand
why should i preserve faith with him who never keep any with me
why should i try to shield him from the consequences of his own wicked act
ask me what you like and there be nothing which i shall hold back
one thing i swear to you and that be that when i write the letter i never dream of any harm to the old gentleman who have be my kindest friend
i entirely believe you madam say sherlock holmes
the recital of these events must be very painful to you and perhaps it will make it easier if i tell you what occur and you can check me if i make any material mistake
the send of this letter be suggest to you by stapleton
he dictate it
i presume that the reason he give be that you would receive help from sir charles for the legal expense connect with your divorce
exactly
and then after you have send the letter he dissuade you from keep the appointment
he tell me that it would hurt his self respect that any other man should find the money for such an object and that though he be a poor man himself he would devote his last penny to remove the obstacles which divide us
he appear to be a very consistent character
and then you hear nothing until you read the report of the death in the paper
no
and he make you swear to say nothing about your appointment with sir charles
he do
he say that the death be a very mysterious one and that i should certainly be suspect if the facts come out
he frighten me into remain silent
quite so
but you have your suspicions
she hesitate and look down
i know him she say
but if he have keep faith with me i should always have do so with him
i think that on the whole you have have a fortunate escape say sherlock holmes
you have have him in your power and he know it and yet you be alive
you have be walk for some months very near to the edge of a precipice
we must wish you good morning now mrs
lyons and it be probable that you will very shortly hear from us again
our case become round off and difficulty after difficulty thin away in front of us say holmes as we stand wait for the arrival of the express from town
i shall soon be in the position of be able to put into a single connect narrative one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern time
students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in godno in little russia in the year ' and of course there be the anderson murder in north carolina but this case possess some feature which be entirely its own
even now we have no clear case against this very wily man
but i shall be very much surprise if it be not clear enough before we go to bed this night
the london express come roar into the station and a small wiry bulldog of a man have spring from a first class carriage
we all three shake hand and i saw at once from the reverential way in which lestrade gaze at my companion that he have learn a good deal since the days when they have first work together
i could well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasoner use then to excite in the practical man
anything good
he ask
the biggest thing for years say holmes
we have two hours before we need think of start
i think we might employ it in get some dinner and then lestrade we will take the london fog out of your throat by give you a breath of the pure night air of dartmoor
never be there
ah well i don't suppose you will forget your first visit
one of sherlock holmes's defect if indeed one may call it a defect be that he be exceedingly loath to communicate his full plan to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment
partly it come no doubt from his own masterful nature which love to dominate and surprise those who be around him
partly also from his professional caution which urge him never to take any chance
the result however be very try for those who be act as his agents and assistants
i have often suffer under it but never more so than during that long drive in the darkness
the great ordeal be in front of us at last we be about to make our final effort and yet holmes have say nothing and i could only surmise what his course of action would be
my nerve thrill with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon our face and the dark void space on either side of the narrow road tell me that we be back upon the moor once again
every stride of the horse and every turn of the wheel be take us nearer to our supreme adventure
our conversation be hamper by the presence of the driver of the hire wagonette so that we be force to talk of trivial matter when our nerve be tense with emotion and anticipation
it be a relief to me after that unnatural restraint when we at last pass frankland's house and know that we be draw near to the hall and to the scene of action
we do not drive up to the door but get down near the gate of the avenue
the wagonette be pay off and order to return to coombe tracey forthwith while we start to walk to merripit house
be you arm lestrade
the little detective smile
as long as i have my trousers i have a hip pocket and as long as i have my hip pocket i have something in it
good
my friend and i be also ready for emergencies
you're mighty close about this affair mr
holmes
what's the game now
a wait game
my word it do not seem a very cheerful place say the detective with a shiver glance round him at the gloomy slop of the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lay over the grimpen mire
i see the light of a house ahead of us
that be merripit house and the end of our journey
i must request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper
we move cautiously along the track as if we be bind for the house but holmes halt us when we be about two hundred yards from it
this will do say he
these rock upon the right make an admirable screen
we be to wait here
yes we shall make our little ambush here
get into this hollow lestrade
you have be inside the house have you not watson
can you tell the position of the room
what be those latticed windows at this end
i think they be the kitchen windows
and the one beyond which shin so brightly
that be certainly the din room
the blind be up
you know the lie of the land best
creep forward quietly and see what they be do but for heaven's sake don't let them know that they be watch
i tiptoe down the path and stoop behind the low wall which surround the stunt orchard
creep in its shadow i reach a point whence i could look straight through the uncurtained window
there be only two men in the room sir henry and stapleton
they sit with their profile towards me on either side of the round table
both of them be smoke cigars and coffee and wine be in front of them
stapleton be talk with animation but the baronet look pale and distrait
perhaps the think of that lonely walk across the ill omen moor be weigh heavily upon his mind
as i watch them stapleton rise and leave the room while sir henry fill his glass again and lean back in his chair puff at his cigar
i hear the creak of a door and the crisp sound of boot upon gravel
the step pass along the path on the other side of the wall under which i crouch
look over i saw the naturalist pause at the door of an out house in the corner of the orchard
a key turn in a lock and as he pass in there be a curious scuffle noise from within
he be only a minute or so inside and then i hear the key turn once more and he pass me and reentered the house
i saw him rejoin his guest and i creep quietly back to where my companion be wait to tell them what i have see
you say watson that the lady be not there
holmes ask when i have finish my report
no
where can she be then since there be no light in any other room except the kitchen
i cannot think where she be
i have say that over the great grimpen mire there hang a dense white fog
it be drift slowly in our direction and bank itself up like a wall on that side of us low but thick and well define
the moon shine on it and it look like a great shimmer ice field with the head of the distant tors as rock bear upon its surface
holmes's face be turn towards it and he mutter impatiently as he watch its sluggish drift
it's move towards us watson
be that serious
very serious indeed the one thing upon earth which could have disarrange my plan
he can't be very long now
it be already ten o'clock
our success and even his life may depend upon his come out before the fog be over the path
the night be clear and fine above us
the star shine cold and bright while a half moon bath the whole scene in a soft uncertain light
before us lay the dark bulk of the house its serrate roof and bristle chimneys hard outline against the silver spangle sky
broad bar of golden light from the lower windows stretch across the orchard and the moor
one of them be suddenly shut off
the servants have leave the kitchen
there only remain the lamp in the din room where the two men the murderous host and the unconscious guest still chat over their cigars
every minute that white woolly plain which cover one half of the moor be drift closer and closer to the house
already the first thin wisps of it be curl across the golden square of the light window
the farther wall of the orchard be already invisible and the tree be stand out of a swirl of white vapour
as we watch it the fog wreaths come crawl round both corner of the house and roll slowly into one dense bank on which the upper floor and the roof float like a strange ship upon a shadowy sea
holmes strike his hand passionately upon the rock in front of us and stamp his feet in his impatience
if he isn't out in a quarter of an hour the path will be cover
in half an hour we won't be able to see our hand in front of us
shall we move farther back upon higher grind
yes i think it would be as well
so as the fog bank flow onward we fell back before it until we be half a mile from the house and still that dense white sea with the moon silver its upper edge sweep slowly and inexorably on
we be go too far say holmes
we dare not take the chance of his be overtake before he can reach us
at all cost we must hold our grind where we be
he drop on his knees and clap his ear to the grind
thank god i think that i hear him come
a sound of quick step break the silence of the moor
crouch among the stone we star intently at the silver tip bank in front of us
the step grow louder and through the fog as through a curtain there step the man whom we be await
he look round him in surprise as he emerge into the clear starlit night
then he come swiftly along the path pass close to where we lay and go on up the long slope behind us
as he walk he glance continually over either shoulder like a man who be ill at ease
hist
cry holmes and i hear the sharp click of a cock pistol
look out
it's come
there be a thin crisp continuous patter from somewhere in the heart of that crawl bank
the cloud be within fifty yards of where we lay and we glare at it all three uncertain what horror be about to break from the heart of it
i be at holmes's elbow and i glance for an instant at his face
it be pale and exultant his eye shin brightly in the moonlight
but suddenly they start forward in a rigid fix stare and his lips part in amazement
at the same instant lestrade give a yell of terror and throw himself face downward upon the grind
i spring to my feet my inert hand grasp my pistol my mind paralyze by the dreadful shape which have spring out upon us from the shadow of the fog
a hound it be an enormous coal black hound but not such a hound as mortal eye have ever see
fire burst from its open mouth its eye glow with a smoulder glare its muzzle and hackle and dewlap be outline in flicker flame
never in the delirious dream of a disorder brain could anything more savage more appal more hellish be conceive than that dark form and savage face which break upon us out of the wall of fog
with long bound the huge black creature be leap down the track follow hard upon the footsteps of our friend
so paralyze be we by the apparition that we allow him to pass before we have recover our nerve
then holmes and i both fire together and the creature give a hideous howl which show that one at least have hit him
he do not pause however but bound onward
far away on the path we saw sir henry look back his face white in the moonlight his hand raise in horror glare helplessly at the frightful thing which be hunt him down
but that cry of pain from the hound have blow all our fear to the wind
if he be vulnerable he be mortal and if we could wind him we could kill him
never have i see a man run as holmes run that night
i be reckon fleet of foot but he outpace me as much as i outpace the little professional
in front of us as we fly up the track we hear scream after scream from sir henry and the deep roar of the hound
i be in time to see the beast spring upon its victim hurl him to the grind and worry at his throat
but the next instant holmes have empty five barrel of his revolver into the creature's flank
with a last howl of agony and a vicious snap in the air it roll upon its back four feet paw furiously and then fell limp upon its side
i stoop pant and press my pistol to the dreadful shimmer head but it be useless to press the trigger
the giant hound be dead
sir henry lay insensible where he have fall
we tear away his collar and holmes breathe a prayer of gratitude when we saw that there be no sign of a wind and that the rescue have be in time
already our friend's eyelids shiver and he make a feeble effort to move
lestrade thrust his brandy flask between the baronet's teeth and two frighten eye be look up at us
my god
he whisper
what be it
what in heaven's name be it
it's dead whatever it be say holmes
we've lay the family ghost once and forever
in mere size and strength it be a terrible creature which be lie stretch before us
it be not a pure bloodhound and it be not a pure mastiff but it appear to be a combination of the two gaunt savage and as large as a small lioness
even now in the stillness of death the huge jaw seem to be drip with a bluish flame and the small deep set cruel eye be ring with fire
i place my hand upon the glow muzzle and as i hold them up my own finger smoulder and gleam in the darkness
phosphorus i say
a cunning preparation of it say holmes sniff at the dead animal
there be no smell which might have interfere with his power of scent
we owe you a deep apology sir henry for have expose you to this fright
i be prepare for a hound but not for such a creature as this
and the fog give us little time to receive him
you have save my life
have first endanger it
be you strong enough to stand
give me another mouthful of that brandy and i shall be ready for anything
so
now if you will help me up
what do you propose to do
to leave you here
you be not fit for further adventure tonight
if you will wait one or other of us will go back with you to the hall
he try to stagger to his feet but he be still ghastly pale and tremble in every limb
we help him to a rock where he sit shiver with his face bury in his hand
we must leave you now say holmes
the rest of our work must be do and every moment be of importance
we have our case and now we only want our man
it's a thousand to one against our find him at the house he continue as we retrace our step swiftly down the path
those shots must have tell him that the game be up
we be some distance off and this fog may have deaden them
he follow the hound to call him off of that you may be certain
no no he's go by this time
but we'll search the house and make sure
the front door be open so we rush in and hurry from room to room to the amazement of a dodder old manservant who meet us in the passage
there be no light save in the din room but holmes catch up the lamp and leave no corner of the house unexplored
no sign could we see of the man whom we be chase
on the upper floor however one of the bedroom doors be lock
there's someone in here cry lestrade
i can hear a movement
open this door
a faint moan and rustle come from within
holmes strike the door just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it fly open
pistol in hand we all three rush into the room
but there be no sign within it of that desperate and defiant villain whom we expect to see
instead we be face by an object so strange and so unexpected that we stand for a moment star at it in amazement
the room have be fashion into a small museum and the wall be line by a number of glass top case full of that collection of butterfly and moths the formation of which have be the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man
in the centre of this room there be an upright beam which have be place at some period as a support for the old worm eat baulk of timber which span the roof
to this post a figure be tie so swathe and muffle in the sheet which have be use to secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it be that of a man or a woman
one towel pass round the throat and be secure at the back of the pillar
another cover the lower part of the face and over it two dark eye eye full of grief and shame and a dreadful question star back at us
in a minute we have tear off the gag unswathed the bond and mrs
stapleton sink upon the floor in front of us
as her beautiful head fell upon her chest i saw the clear red weal of a whiplash across her neck
the brute
cry holmes
here lestrade your brandy bottle
put her in the chair
she have faint from ill usage and exhaustion
she open her eye again
be he safe
she ask
have he escape
he cannot escape us madam
no no i do not mean my husband
sir henry
be he safe
yes
and the hound
it be dead
she give a long sigh of satisfaction
thank god
thank god
oh this villain
see how he have treat me
she shoot her arm out from her sleeves and we saw with horror that they be all mottle with bruise
but this be nothing nothing
it be my mind and soul that he have torture and defile
i could endure it all ill usage solitude a life of deception everything as long as i could still cling to the hope that i have his love but now i know that in this also i have be his dupe and his tool
she break into passionate sob as she speak
you bear him no good will madam say holmes
tell us then where we shall find him
if you have ever aid him in evil help us now and so atone
there be but one place where he can have flee she answer
there be an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire
it be there that he keep his hound and there also he have make preparations so that he might have a refuge
that be where he would fly
the fog bank lay like white wool against the window
holmes hold the lamp towards it
see say he
no one could find his way into the grimpen mire tonight
she laugh and clap her hand
her eye and teeth gleam with fierce merriment
he may find his way in but never out she cry
how can he see the guide wands tonight
we plant them together he and i to mark the pathway through the mire
oh if i could only have pluck them out today
then indeed you would have have him at your mercy
it be evident to us that all pursuit be in vain until the fog have lift
meanwhile we leave lestrade in possession of the house while holmes and i go back with the baronet to baskerville hall
the story of the stapletons could no longer be withhold from him but he take the blow bravely when he learn the truth about the woman whom he have love
but the shock of the night's adventure have shatter his nerve and before morning he lay delirious in a high fever under the care of dr
mortimer
the two of them be destine to travel together round the world before sir henry have become once more the hale hearty man that he have be before he become master of that ill omen estate
and now i come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular narrative in which i have try to make the reader share those dark fear and vague surmise which cloud our live so long and end in so tragic a manner
on the morning after the death of the hound the fog have lift and we be guide by mrs
stapleton to the point where they have find a pathway through the bog
it help us to realize the horror of this woman's life when we saw the eagerness and joy with which she lay us on her husband's track
we leave her stand upon the thin peninsula of firm peaty soil which taper out into the widespread bog
from the end of it a small wand plant here and there show where the path zigzag from tuft to tuft of rush among those green scum pit and foul quagmires which bar the way to the stranger
rank reeds and lush slimy water plant send an odour of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour onto our face while a false step plunge us more than once thigh deep into the dark quiver mire which shake for yards in soft undulations around our feet
its tenacious grip pluck at our heel as we walk and when we sink into it it be as if some malignant hand be tug us down into those obscene depths so grim and purposeful be the clutch in which it hold us
once only we saw a trace that someone have pass that perilous way before us
from amid a tuft of cotton grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing be project
holmes sink to his waist as he step from the path to seize it and have we not be there to drag him out he could never have set his foot upon firm land again
he hold an old black boot in the air
meyers toronto be print on the leather inside
it be worth a mud bath say he
it be our friend sir henry's miss boot
throw there by stapleton in his flight
exactly
he retain it in his hand after use it to set the hound upon the track
he flee when he know the game be up still clutch it
and he hurl it away at this point of his flight
we know at least that he come so far in safety
but more than that we be never destine to know though there be much which we might surmise
there be no chance of find footsteps in the mire for the rise mud ooze swiftly in upon them but as we at last reach firmer grind beyond the morass we all look eagerly for them
but no slightest sign of them ever meet our eye
if the earth tell a true story then stapleton never reach that island of refuge towards which he struggle through the fog upon that last night
somewhere in the heart of the great grimpen mire down in the foul slime of the huge morass which have suck him in this cold and cruel hearted man be forever bury
many trace we find of him in the bog gird island where he have hide his savage ally
a huge drive wheel and a shaft half fill with rubbish show the position of an abandon mine
beside it be the crumble remain of the cottages of the miners drive away no doubt by the foul reek of the surround swamp
in one of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnaw bone show where the animal have be confine
a skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhere to it lay among the debris
a dog
say holmes
by jove a curly haired spaniel
poor mortimer will never see his pet again
well i do not know that this place contain any secret which we have not already fathom
he could hide his hound but he could not hush its voice and hence come those cry which even in daylight be not pleasant to hear
on an emergency he could keep the hound in the out house at merripit but it be always a risk and it be only on the supreme day which he regard as the end of all his efforts that he dare do it
this paste in the tin be no doubt the luminous mixture with which the creature be daub
it be suggest of course by the story of the family hell hound and by the desire to frighten old sir charles to death
no wonder the poor devil of a convict run and scream even as our friend do and as we ourselves might have do when he saw such a creature bound through the darkness of the moor upon his track
it be a cunning device for apart from the chance of drive your victim to his death what peasant would venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight of it as many have do upon the moor
i say it in london watson and i say it again now that never yet have we help to hunt down a more dangerous man than he who be lie yonder he sweep his long arm towards the huge mottle expanse of green splotch bog which stretch away until it merge into the russet slop of the moor
it be the end of november and holmes and i sit upon a raw and foggy night on either side of a blaze fire in our sit room in baker street
since the tragic upshot of our visit to devonshire he have be engage in two affairs of the utmost importance in the first of which he have expose the atrocious conduct of colonel upwood in connection with the famous card scandal of the nonpareil club while in the second he have defend the unfortunate mme
montpensier from the charge of murder which hang over her in connection with the death of her step daughter mlle
carere the young lady who as it will be remember be find six months later alive and marry in new york
my friend be in excellent spirit over the success which have attend a succession of difficult and important case so that i be able to induce him to discuss the detail of the baskerville mystery
i have wait patiently for the opportunity for i be aware that he would never permit case to overlap and that his clear and logical mind would not be draw from its present work to dwell upon memories of the past
sir henry and dr
mortimer be however in london on their way to that long voyage which have be recommend for the restoration of his shatter nerve
they have call upon us that very afternoon so that it be natural that the subject should come up for discussion
the whole course of events say holmes from the point of view of the man who call himself stapleton be simple and direct although to us who have no mean in the begin of know the motives of his action and could only learn part of the facts it all appear exceedingly complex
i have have the advantage of two conversations with mrs
stapleton and the case have now be so entirely clear up that i be not aware that there be anything which have remain a secret to us
you will find a few note upon the matter under the head b in my index list of case
perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of events from memory
certainly though i cannot guarantee that i carry all the facts in my mind
intense mental concentration have a curious way of blot out what have pass
the barrister who have his case at his fingers' end and be able to argue with an expert upon his own subject find that a week or two of the court will drive it all out of his head once more
so each of my case displace the last and mlle
carere have blur my recollection of baskerville hall
tomorrow some other little problem may be submit to my notice which will in turn dispossess the fair french lady and the infamous upwood
so far as the case of the hound go however i will give you the course of events as nearly as i can and you will suggest anything which i may have forget
my inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait do not lie and that this fellow be indeed a baskerville
he be a son of that rodger baskerville the younger brother of sir charles who flee with a sinister reputation to south america where he be say to have die unmarried
he do as a matter of fact marry and have one child this fellow whose real name be the same as his father's
he marry beryl garcia one of the beauties of costa rica and have purloin a considerable sum of public money he change his name to vandeleur and flee to england where he establish a school in the east of yorkshire
his reason for attempt this special line of business be that he have strike up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage home and that he have use this man's ability to make the undertake a success
fraser the tutor die however and the school which have begin well sink from disrepute into infamy
the vandeleurs find it convenient to change their name to stapleton and he bring the remain of his fortune his scheme for the future and his taste for entomology to the south of england
i learn at the british museum that he be a recognize authority upon the subject and that the name of vandeleur have be permanently attach to a certain moth which he have in his yorkshire days be the first to describe
we now come to that portion of his life which have prove to be of such intense interest to us
the fellow have evidently make inquiry and find that only two live intervene between him and a valuable estate
when he go to devonshire his plan be i believe exceedingly hazy but that he mean mischief from the first be evident from the way in which he take his wife with him in the character of his sister
the idea of use her as a decoy be clearly already in his mind though he may not have be certain how the detail of his plot be to be arrange
he mean in the end to have the estate and he be ready to use any tool or run any risk for that end
his first act be to establish himself as near to his ancestral home as he could and his second be to cultivate a friendship with sir charles baskerville and with the neighbour
the baronet himself tell him about the family hound and so prepare the way for his own death
stapleton as i will continue to call him know that the old man's heart be weak and that a shock would kill him
so much he have learn from dr
mortimer
he have hear also that sir charles be superstitious and have take this grim legend very seriously
his ingenious mind instantly suggest a way by which the baronet could be do to death and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the guilt to the real murderer
have conceive the idea he proceed to carry it out with considerable finesse
an ordinary schemer would have be content to work with a savage hound
the use of artificial mean to make the creature diabolical be a flash of genius upon his part
the dog he buy in london from ross and mangle the dealers in fulham road
it be the strongest and most savage in their possession
he bring it down by the north devon line and walk a great distance over the moor so as to get it home without excite any remark
he have already on his insect hunt learn to penetrate the grimpen mire and so have find a safe hide place for the creature
here he kennel it and wait his chance
but it be some time come
the old gentleman could not be decoy outside of his ground at night
several time stapleton lurk about with his hound but without avail
it be during these fruitless quest that he or rather his ally be see by peasants and that the legend of the demon dog receive a new confirmation
he have hop that his wife might lure sir charles to his ruin but here she prove unexpectedly independent
she would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in a sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy
threats and even i be sorry to say blow refuse to move her
she would have nothing to do with it and for a time stapleton be at a deadlock
he find a way out of his difficulties through the chance that sir charles who have conceive a friendship for him make him the minister of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman mrs
laura lyons
by represent himself as a single man he acquire complete influence over her and he give her to understand that in the event of her obtain a divorce from her husband he would marry her
his plan be suddenly bring to a head by his knowledge that sir charles be about to leave the hall on the advice of dr
mortimer with whose opinion he himself pretend to coincide
he must act at once or his victim might get beyond his power
he therefore put pressure upon mrs
lyons to write this letter implore the old man to give her an interview on the even before his departure for london
he then by a specious argument prevent her from go and so have the chance for which he have wait
drive back in the even from coombe tracey he be in time to get his hound to treat it with his infernal paint and to bring the beast round to the gate at which he have reason to expect that he would find the old gentleman wait
the dog incite by its master spring over the wicket gate and pursue the unfortunate baronet who flee scream down the yew alley
in that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have be a dreadful sight to see that huge black creature with its flame jaw and blaze eye bound after its victim
he fell dead at the end of the alley from heart disease and terror
the hound have keep upon the grassy border while the baronet have run down the path so that no track but the man's be visible
on see him lie still the creature have probably approach to sniff at him but find him dead have turn away again
it be then that it leave the print which be actually observe by dr
mortimer
the hound be call off and hurry away to its lair in the grimpen mire and a mystery be leave which puzzle the authorities alarm the countryside and finally bring the case within the scope of our observation
so much for the death of sir charles baskerville
you perceive the devilish cunning of it for really it would be almost impossible to make a case against the real murderer
his only accomplice be one who could never give him away and the grotesque inconceivable nature of the device only serve to make it more effective
both of the women concern in the case mrs
stapleton and mrs
laura lyons be leave with a strong suspicion against stapleton
mrs
stapleton know that he have design upon the old man and also of the existence of the hound
mrs
lyons know neither of these things but have be impress by the death occur at the time of an uncancelled appointment which be only know to him
however both of them be under his influence and he have nothing to fear from them
the first half of his task be successfully accomplish but the more difficult still remain
it be possible that stapleton do not know of the existence of an heir in canada
in any case he would very soon learn it from his friend dr
mortimer and he be tell by the latter all detail about the arrival of henry baskerville
stapleton's first idea be that this young stranger from canada might possibly be do to death in london without come down to devonshire at all
he distrust his wife ever since she have refuse to help him in lay a trap for the old man and he dare not leave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her
it be for this reason that he take her to london with him
they lodge i find at the mexborough private hotel in craven street which be actually one of those call upon by my agent in search of evidence
here he keep his wife imprison in her room while he disguise in a beard follow dr
mortimer to baker street and afterwards to the station and to the northumberland hotel
his wife have some inkling of his plan but she have such a fear of her husband a fear found upon brutal ill treatment that she dare not write to warn the man whom she know to be in danger
if the letter should fall into stapleton's hand her own life would not be safe
eventually as we know she adopt the expedient of cut out the word which would form the message and address the letter in a disguise hand
it reach the baronet and give him the first warn of his danger
it be very essential for stapleton to get some article of sir henry's attire so that in case he be drive to use the dog he might always have the mean of set him upon his track
with characteristic promptness and audacity he set about this at once and we cannot doubt that the boot or chamber maid of the hotel be well bribe to help him in his design
by chance however the first boot which be procure for him be a new one and therefore useless for his purpose
he then have it return and obtain another a most instructive incident since it prove conclusively to my mind that we be deal with a real hound as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an old boot and this indifference to a new one
the more outre and grotesque an incident be the more carefully it deserve to be examine and the very point which appear to complicate a case be when duly consider and scientifically handle the one which be most likely to elucidate it
then we have the visit from our friends next morning shadow always by stapleton in the cab
from his knowledge of our room and of my appearance as well as from his general conduct i be incline to think that stapleton's career of crime have be by no mean limit to this single baskerville affair
it be suggestive that during the last three years there have be four considerable burglaries in the west country for none of which be any criminal ever arrest
the last of these at folkestone court in may be remarkable for the cold blood pistolling of the page who surprise the mask and solitary burglar
i cannot doubt that stapleton recruit his wan resources in this fashion and that for years he have be a desperate and dangerous man
we have an example of his readiness of resource that morning when he get away from us so successfully and also of his audacity in send back my own name to me through the cabman
from that moment he understand that i have take over the case in london and that therefore there be no chance for him there
he return to dartmoor and await the arrival of the baronet
one moment
say i
you have no doubt describe the sequence of events correctly but there be one point which you have leave unexplained
what become of the hound when its master be in london
i have give some attention to this matter and it be undoubtedly of importance
there can be no question that stapleton have a confidant though it be unlikely that he ever place himself in his power by share all his plan with him
there be an old manservant at merripit house whose name be anthony
his connection with the stapletons can be trace for several years as far back as the school master days so that he must have be aware that his master and mistress be really husband and wife
this man have disappear and have escape from the country
it be suggestive that anthony be not a common name in england while antonio be so in all spanish or spanish american countries
the man like mrs
stapleton herself speak good english but with a curious lisp accent
i have myself see this old man cross the grimpen mire by the path which stapleton have mark out
it be very probable therefore that in the absence of his master it be he who care for the hound though he may never have know the purpose for which the beast be use
the stapletons then go down to devonshire whither they be soon follow by sir henry and you
one word now as to how i stand myself at that time
it may possibly recur to your memory that when i examine the paper upon which the print word be fasten i make a close inspection for the water mark
in do so i hold it within a few inch of my eye and be conscious of a faint smell of the scent know as white jessamine
there be seventy five perfume which it be very necessary that a criminal expert should be able to distinguish from each other and case have more than once within my own experience depend upon their prompt recognition
the scent suggest the presence of a lady and already my thoughts begin to turn towards the stapletons
thus i have make certain of the hound and have guess at the criminal before ever we go to the west country
it be my game to watch stapleton
it be evident however that i could not do this if i be with you since he would be keenly on his guard
i deceive everybody therefore yourself include and i come down secretly when i be suppose to be in london
my hardships be not so great as you imagine though such trifle detail must never interfere with the investigation of a case
i stay for the most part at coombe tracey and only use the hut upon the moor when it be necessary to be near the scene of action
cartwright have come down with me and in his disguise as a country boy he be of great assistance to me
i be dependent upon him for food and clean linen
when i be watch stapleton cartwright be frequently watch you so that i be able to keep my hand upon all the string
i have already tell you that your report reach me rapidly be forward instantly from baker street to coombe tracey
they be of great service to me and especially that one incidentally truthful piece of biography of stapleton's
i be able to establish the identity of the man and the woman and know at last exactly how i stand
the case have be considerably complicate through the incident of the escape convict and the relations between him and the barrymores
this also you clear up in a very effective way though i have already come to the same conclusions from my own observations
by the time that you discover me upon the moor i have a complete knowledge of the whole business but i have not a case which could go to a jury
even stapleton's attempt upon sir henry that night which end in the death of the unfortunate convict do not help us much in prove murder against our man
there seem to be no alternative but to catch him red hand and to do so we have to use sir henry alone and apparently unprotected as a bait
we do so and at the cost of a severe shock to our client we succeed in complete our case and drive stapleton to his destruction
that sir henry should have be expose to this be i must confess a reproach to my management of the case but we have no mean of foresee the terrible and paralyze spectacle which the beast present nor could we predict the fog which enable him to burst upon us at such short notice
we succeed in our object at a cost which both the specialist and dr
mortimer assure me will be a temporary one
a long journey may enable our friend to recover not only from his shatter nerve but also from his wound feel
his love for the lady be deep and sincere and to him the saddest part of all this black business be that he should have be deceive by her
it only remain to indicate the part which she have play throughout
there can be no doubt that stapleton exercise an influence over her which may have be love or may have be fear or very possibly both since they be by no mean incompatible emotions
it be at least absolutely effective
at his command she consent to pass as his sister though he find the limit of his power over her when he endeavour to make her the direct accessory to murder
she be ready to warn sir henry so far as she could without implicate her husband and again and again she try to do so
stapleton himself seem to have be capable of jealousy and when he saw the baronet pay court to the lady even though it be part of his own plan still he could not help interrupt with a passionate outburst which reveal the fiery soul which his self contain manner so cleverly conceal
by encourage the intimacy he make it certain that sir henry would frequently come to merripit house and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he desire
on the day of the crisis however his wife turn suddenly against him
she have learn something of the death of the convict and she know that the hound be be keep in the outhouse on the even that sir henry be come to dinner
she tax her husband with his intend crime and a furious scene follow in which he show her for the first time that she have a rival in his love
her fidelity turn in an instant to bitter hatred and he saw that she would betray him
he tie her up therefore that she might have no chance of warn sir henry and he hop no doubt that when the whole countryside put down the baronet's death to the curse of his family as they certainly would do he could win his wife back to accept an accomplish fact and to keep silent upon what she know
in this i fancy that in any case he make a miscalculation and that if we have not be there his doom would none the less have be seal
a woman of spanish blood do not condone such an injury so lightly
and now my dear watson without refer to my note i cannot give you a more detail account of this curious case
i do not know that anything essential have be leave unexplained
he could not hope to frighten sir henry to death as he have do the old uncle with his bogie hound
the beast be savage and half starve
if its appearance do not frighten its victim to death at least it would paralyze the resistance which might be offer
no doubt
there only remain one difficulty
if stapleton come into the succession how could he explain the fact that he the heir have be live unannounced under another name so close to the property
how could he claim it without cause suspicion and inquiry
it be a formidable difficulty and i fear that you ask too much when you expect me to solve it
the past and the present be within the field of my inquiry but what a man may do in the future be a hard question to answer
mrs
stapleton have hear her husband discuss the problem on several occasion
there be three possible course
he might claim the property from south america establish his identity before the british authorities there and so obtain the fortune without ever come to england at all or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short time that he need be in london or again he might furnish an accomplice with the proof and paper put him in as heir and retain a claim upon some proportion of his income
we cannot doubt from what we know of him that he would have find some way out of the difficulty
and now my dear watson we have have some weeks of severe work and for one even i think we may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channel
i have a box for 'les huguenots '
have you hear the de reszkes
might i trouble you then to be ready in half an hour and we can stop at marcini's for a little dinner on the way
we be seat at breakfast one morning my wife and i when the maid bring in a telegram
it be from sherlock holmes and run in this way have you a couple of days to spare
have just be wire for from the west of england in connection with boscombe valley tragedy
shall be glad if you will come with me
air and scenery perfect
leave paddington by the
what do you say dear
say my wife look across at me
will you go
i really don't know what to say
i have a fairly long list at present
oh anstruther would do your work for you
you have be look a little pale lately
i think that the change would do you good and you be always so interest in mr
sherlock holmes' case
i should be ungrateful if i be not see what i gain through one of them i answer
but if i be to go i must pack at once for i have only half an hour
my experience of camp life in afghanistan have at least have the effect of make me a prompt and ready traveller
my want be few and simple so that in less than the time state i be in a cab with my valise rattle away to paddington station
sherlock holmes be pace up and down the platform his tall gaunt figure make even gaunter and taller by his long grey travel cloak and close fit cloth cap
it be really very good of you to come watson say he
it make a considerable difference to me have someone with me on whom i can thoroughly rely
local aid be always either worthless or else bias
if you will keep the two corner seat i shall get the ticket
we have the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of paper which holmes have bring with him
among these he rummage and read with intervals of note take and of meditation until we be past read
then he suddenly roll them all into a gigantic ball and toss them up onto the rack
have you hear anything of the case
he ask
not a word
i have not see a paper for some days
the london press have not have very full account
i have just be look through all the recent paper in order to master the particulars
it seem from what i gather to be one of those simple case which be so extremely difficult
that sound a little paradoxical
but it be profoundly true
singularity be almost invariably a clue
the more featureless and commonplace a crime be the more difficult it be to bring it home
in this case however they have establish a very serious case against the son of the murder man
it be a murder then
well it be conjecture to be so
i shall take nothing for grant until i have the opportunity of look personally into it
i will explain the state of things to you as far as i have be able to understand it in a very few word
boscombe valley be a country district not very far from ross in herefordshire
the largest land proprietor in that part be a mr
john turner who make his money in australia and return some years ago to the old country
one of the farm which he hold that of hatherley be let to mr
charles mccarthy who be also an ex australian
the men have know each other in the colonies so that it be not unnatural that when they come to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible
turner be apparently the richer man so mccarthy become his tenant but still remain it seem upon term of perfect equality as they be frequently together
mccarthy have one son a lad of eighteen and turner have an only daughter of the same age but neither of them have wive live
they appear to have avoid the society of the neighbour english families and to have lead retire live though both the mccarthys be fond of sport and be frequently see at the race meet of the neighbourhood
mccarthy keep two servants a man and a girl
turner have a considerable household some half dozen at the least
that be as much as i have be able to gather about the families
now for the facts
on june 3rd that be on monday last mccarthy leave his house at hatherley about three in the afternoon and walk down to the boscombe pool which be a small lake form by the spread out of the stream which run down the boscombe valley
he have be out with his serve man in the morning at ross and he have tell the man that he must hurry as he have an appointment of importance to keep at three
from that appointment he never come back alive
from hatherley farm house to the boscombe pool be a quarter of a mile and two people saw him as he pass over this grind
one be an old woman whose name be not mention and the other be william crowder a game keeper in the employ of mr
turner
both these witness depose that mr
mccarthy be walk alone
the game keeper add that within a few minutes of his see mr
mccarthy pass he have see his son mr
jam mccarthy go the same way with a gun under his arm
to the best of his belief the father be actually in sight at the time and the son be follow him
he think no more of the matter until he hear in the even of the tragedy that have occur
the two mccarthys be see after the time when william crowder the game keeper lose sight of them
the boscombe pool be thickly wooded round with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge
a girl of fourteen patience moran who be the daughter of the lodge keeper of the boscombe valley estate be in one of the woods pick flower
she state that while she be there she saw at the border of the wood and close by the lake mr
mccarthy and his son and that they appear to be have a violent quarrel
she hear mr
mccarthy the elder use very strong language to his son and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father
she be so frighten by their violence that she run away and tell her mother when she reach home that she have leave the two mccarthys quarrel near boscombe pool and that she be afraid that they be go to fight
she have hardly say the word when young mr
mccarthy come run up to the lodge to say that he have find his father dead in the wood and to ask for the help of the lodge keeper
he be much excite without either his gun or his hat and his right hand and sleeve be observe to be stain with fresh blood
on follow him they find the dead body stretch out upon the grass beside the pool
the head have be beat in by repeat blow of some heavy and blunt weapon
the injuries be such as might very well have be inflict by the butt end of his son's gun which be find lie on the grass within a few pace of the body
under these circumstances the young man be instantly arrest and a verdict of 'wilful murder' have be return at the inquest on tuesday he be on wednesday bring before the magistrates at ross who have refer the case to the next assizes
those be the main facts of the case as they come out before the coroner and the police court
i could hardly imagine a more damn case i remark
if ever circumstantial evidence point to a criminal it do so here
circumstantial evidence be a very tricky thing answer holmes thoughtfully
it may seem to point very straight to one thing but if you shift your own point of view a little you may find it point in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different
it must be confess however that the case look exceedingly grave against the young man and it be very possible that he be indeed the culprit
there be several people in the neighbourhood however and among them miss turner the daughter of the neighbour landowner who believe in his innocence and who have retain lestrade whom you may recollect in connection with the study in scarlet to work out the case in his interest
lestrade be rather puzzle have refer the case to me and hence it be that two middle age gentlemen be fly westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digest their breakfast at home
i be afraid say i that the facts be so obvious that you will find little credit to be gain out of this case
there be nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact he answer laugh
besides we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have be by no mean obvious to mr
lestrade
you know me too well to think that i be boast when i say that i shall either confirm or destroy his theory by mean which he be quite incapable of employ or even of understand
to take the first example to hand i very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window be upon the right hand side and yet i question whether mr
lestrade would have note even so self evident a thing as that
how on earth my dear fellow i know you well
i know the military neatness which characterise you
you shave every morning and in this season you shave by the sunlight but since your shave be less and less complete as we get farther back on the leave side until it become positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw it be surely very clear that that side be less illuminate than the other
i could not imagine a man of your habit look at himself in an equal light and be satisfy with such a result
i only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference
therein lie my metier and it be just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lie before us
there be one or two minor point which be bring out in the inquest and which be worth consider
what be they
it appear that his arrest do not take place at once but after the return to hatherley farm
on the inspector of constabulary inform him that he be a prisoner he remark that he be not surprise to hear it and that it be no more than his desert
this observation of his have the natural effect of remove any trace of doubt which might have remain in the mind of the coroner's jury
it be a confession i ejaculate
no for it be follow by a protestation of innocence
come on the top of such a damn series of events it be at least a most suspicious remark
on the contrary say holmes it be the brightest rift which i can at present see in the cloud
however innocent he might be he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances be very black against him
have he appear surprise at his own arrest or feign indignation at it i should have look upon it as highly suspicious because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheme man
his frank acceptance of the situation mark him as either an innocent man or else as a man of considerable self restraint and firmness
as to his remark about his desert it be also not unnatural if you consider that he stand beside the dead body of his father and that there be no doubt that he have that very day so far forget his filial duty as to bandy word with him and even accord to the little girl whose evidence be so important to raise his hand as if to strike him
the self reproach and contrition which be display in his remark appear to me to be the sign of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one
i shake my head
many men have be hang on far slighter evidence i remark
so they have
and many men have be wrongfully hang
what be the young man's own account of the matter
it be i be afraid not very encourage to his supporters though there be one or two point in it which be suggestive
you will find it here and may read it for yourself
he pick out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire paper and have turn down the sheet he point out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man have give his own statement of what have occur
i settle myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully
it run in this way mr
jam mccarthy the only son of the decease be then call and give evidence as follow 'i have be away from home for three days at bristol and have only just return upon the morning of last monday the 3rd
my father be absent from home at the time of my arrival and i be inform by the maid that he have drive over to ross with john cobb the groom
shortly after my return i hear the wheel of his trap in the yard and look out of my window i saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard though i be not aware in which direction he be go
i then take my gun and stroll out in the direction of the boscombe pool with the intention of visit the rabbit warren which be upon the other side
on my way i saw william crowder the game keeper as he have state in his evidence but he be mistake in think that i be follow my father
i have no idea that he be in front of me
when about a hundred yards from the pool i hear a cry of cooee
which be a usual signal between my father and myself
i then hurry forward and find him stand by the pool
he appear to be much surprise at see me and ask me rather roughly what i be do there
a conversation ensue which lead to high word and almost to blow for my father be a man of a very violent temper
see that his passion be become ungovernable i leave him and return towards hatherley farm
i have not go more than yards however when i hear a hideous outcry behind me which cause me to run back again
i find my father expire upon the grind with his head terribly injure
i drop my gun and hold him in my arm but he almost instantly expire
i kneel beside him for some minutes and then make my way to mr
turner's lodge keeper his house be the nearest to ask for assistance
i saw no one near my father when i return and i have no idea how he come by his injuries
he be not a popular man be somewhat cold and forbid in his manners but he have as far as i know no active enemies
i know nothing further of the matter '
the coroner do your father make any statement to you before he die
witness he mumble a few word but i could only catch some allusion to a rat
the coroner what do you understand by that
witness it convey no mean to me
i think that he be delirious
the coroner what be the point upon which you and your father have this final quarrel
witness i should prefer not to answer
the coroner i be afraid that i must press it
witness it be really impossible for me to tell you
i can assure you that it have nothing to do with the sad tragedy which follow
the coroner that be for the court to decide
i need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceed which may arise
witness i must still refuse
the coroner i understand that the cry of 'cooee' be a common signal between you and your father
witness it be
the coroner how be it then that he utter it before he saw you and before he even know that you have return from bristol
witness with considerable confusion i do not know
a juryman do you see nothing which arouse your suspicions when you return on hear the cry and find your father fatally injure
witness nothing definite
the coroner what do you mean
witness i be so disturb and excite as i rush out into the open that i could think of nothing except of my father
yet i have a vague impression that as i run forward something lay upon the grind to the leave of me
it seem to me to be something grey in colour a coat of some sort or a plaid perhaps
when i rise from my father i look round for it but it be go
'do you mean that it disappear before you go for help '
'yes it be go '
'you cannot say what it be '
'no i have a feel something be there '
'how far from the body '
'a dozen yards or so '
'and how far from the edge of the wood '
'about the same '
'then if it be remove it be while you be within a dozen yards of it '
'yes but with my back towards it '
this conclude the examination of the witness
i see say i as i glance down the column that the coroner in his conclude remark be rather severe upon young mccarthy
he call attention and with reason to the discrepancy about his father have signal to him before see him also to his refusal to give detail of his conversation with his father and his singular account of his father's die word
they be all as he remark very much against the son
holmes laugh softly to himself and stretch himself out upon the cushion seat
both you and the coroner have be at some pain say he to single out the very strongest point in the young man's favour
don't you see that you alternately give him credit for have too much imagination and too little
too little if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury too much if he evolve from his own inner consciousness anything so outre as a die reference to a rat and the incident of the vanish cloth
no sir i shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man say be true and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us
and now here be my pocket petrarch and not another word shall i say of this case until we be on the scene of action
we lunch at swindon and i see that we shall be there in twenty minutes
it be nearly four o'clock when we at last after pass through the beautiful stroud valley and over the broad gleam severn find ourselves at the pretty little country town of ross
a lean ferret like man furtive and sly look be wait for us upon the platform
in spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather leggings which he wear in deference to his rustic surround i have no difficulty in recognise lestrade of scotland yard
with him we drive to the hereford arm where a room have already be engage for us
i have order a carriage say lestrade as we sit over a cup of tea
i know your energetic nature and that you would not be happy until you have be on the scene of the crime
it be very nice and complimentary of you holmes answer
it be entirely a question of barometric pressure
lestrade look startle
i do not quite follow he say
how be the glass
twenty nine i see
no wind and not a cloud in the sky
i have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoke and the sofa be very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination
i do not think that it be probable that i shall use the carriage to night
lestrade laugh indulgently
you have no doubt already form your conclusions from the newspapers he say
the case be as plain as a pikestaff and the more one go into it the plainer it become
still of course one can't refuse a lady and such a very positive one too
she have hear of you and would have your opinion though i repeatedly tell her that there be nothing which you could do which i have not already do
why bless my soul
here be her carriage at the door
he have hardly speak before there rush into the room one of the most lovely young women that i have ever see in my life
her violet eye shin her lips part a pink flush upon her cheek all think of her natural reserve lose in her overpower excitement and concern
oh mr
sherlock holmes
she cry glance from one to the other of us and finally with a woman's quick intuition fasten upon my companion i be so glad that you have come
i have drive down to tell you so
i know that jam didn't do it
i know it and i want you to start upon your work know it too
never let yourself doubt upon that point
we have know each other since we be little children and i know his fault as no one else do but he be too tender hearted to hurt a fly
such a charge be absurd to anyone who really know him
i hope we may clear him miss turner say sherlock holmes
you may rely upon my do all that i can
but you have read the evidence
you have form some conclusion
do you not see some loophole some flaw
do you not yourself think that he be innocent
i think that it be very probable
there now
she cry throw back her head and look defiantly at lestrade
you hear
he give me hop
lestrade shrug his shoulder
i be afraid that my colleague have be a little quick in form his conclusions he say
but he be right
oh
i know that he be right
jam never do it
and about his quarrel with his father i be sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner be because i be concern in it
in what way
ask holmes
it be no time for me to hide anything
jam and his father have many disagreements about me
mr
mccarthy be very anxious that there should be a marriage between us
jam and i have always love each other as brother and sister but of course he be young and have see very little of life yet and and well he naturally do not wish to do anything like that yet
so there be quarrel and this i be sure be one of them
and your father
ask holmes
be he in favour of such a union
no he be averse to it also
no one but mr
mccarthy be in favour of it
a quick blush pass over her fresh young face as holmes shoot one of his keen question glance at her
thank you for this information say he
may i see your father if i call to morrow
i be afraid the doctor won't allow it
the doctor
yes have you not hear
poor father have never be strong for years back but this have break him down completely
he have take to his bed and dr
willows say that he be a wreck and that his nervous system be shatter
mr
mccarthy be the only man alive who have know dad in the old days in victoria
ha
in victoria
that be important
yes at the mine
quite so at the gold mine where as i understand mr
turner make his money
yes certainly
thank you miss turner
you have be of material assistance to me
you will tell me if you have any news to morrow
no doubt you will go to the prison to see jam
oh if you do mr
holmes do tell him that i know him to be innocent
i will miss turner
i must go home now for dad be very ill and he miss me so if i leave him
good bye and god help you in your undertake
she hurry from the room as impulsively as she have enter and we hear the wheel of her carriage rattle off down the street
i be ashamed of you holmes say lestrade with dignity after a few minutes' silence
why should you raise up hop which you be bind to disappoint
i be not over tender of heart but i call it cruel
i think that i see my way to clear jam mccarthy say holmes
have you an order to see him in prison
yes but only for you and me
then i shall reconsider my resolution about go out
we have still time to take a train to hereford and see him to night
ample
then let us do so
watson i fear that you will find it very slow but i shall only be away a couple of hours
i walk down to the station with them and then wander through the streets of the little town finally return to the hotel where i lay upon the sofa and try to interest myself in a yellow back novel
the puny plot of the story be so thin however when compare to the deep mystery through which we be grope and i find my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact that i at last fling it across the room and give myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day
suppose that this unhappy young man's story be absolutely true then what hellish thing what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occur between the time when he part from his father and the moment when draw back by his scream he rush into the glade
it be something terrible and deadly
what could it be
might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts
i ring the bell and call for the weekly county paper which contain a verbatim account of the inquest
in the surgeon's deposition it be state that the posterior third of the leave parietal bone and the leave half of the occipital bone have be shatter by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon
i mark the spot upon my own head
clearly such a blow must have be strike from behind
that be to some extent in favour of the accuse as when see quarrel he be face to face with his father
still it do not go for very much for the older man might have turn his back before the blow fell
still it might be worth while to call holmes' attention to it
then there be the peculiar die reference to a rat
what could that mean
it could not be delirium
a man die from a sudden blow do not commonly become delirious
no it be more likely to be an attempt to explain how he meet his fate
but what could it indicate
i cudgel my brain to find some possible explanation
and then the incident of the grey cloth see by young mccarthy
if that be true the murderer must have drop some part of his dress presumably his overcoat in his flight and must have have the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son be kneel with his back turn not a dozen pace off
what a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing be
i do not wonder at lestrade's opinion and yet i have so much faith in sherlock holmes' insight that i could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seem to strengthen his conviction of young mccarthy's innocence
it be late before sherlock holmes return
he come back alone for lestrade be stay in lodge in the town
the glass still keep very high he remark as he sit down
it be of importance that it should not rain before we be able to go over the grind
on the other hand a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that and i do not wish to do it when fag by a long journey
i have see young mccarthy
and what do you learn from him
nothing
could he throw no light
none at all
i be incline to think at one time that he know who have do it and be screen him or her but i be convince now that he be as puzzle as everyone else
he be not a very quick witted youth though comely to look at and i should think sound at heart
i cannot admire his taste i remark if it be indeed a fact that he be averse to a marriage with so charm a young lady as this miss turner
ah thereby hang a rather painful tale
this fellow be madly insanely in love with her but some two years ago when he be only a lad and before he really know her for she have be away five years at a board school what do the idiot do but get into the clutch of a barmaid in bristol and marry her at a registry office
no one know a word of the matter but you can imagine how madden it must be to him to be upbraid for not do what he would give his very eye to do but what he know to be absolutely impossible
it be sheer frenzy of this sort which make him throw his hand up into the air when his father at their last interview be goad him on to propose to miss turner
on the other hand he have no mean of support himself and his father who be by all account a very hard man would have throw him over utterly have he know the truth
it be with his barmaid wife that he have spend the last three days in bristol and his father do not know where he be
mark that point
it be of importance
good have come out of evil however for the barmaid find from the paper that he be in serious trouble and likely to be hang have throw him over utterly and have write to him to say that she have a husband already in the bermuda dockyard so that there be really no tie between them
i think that that bite of news have console young mccarthy for all that he have suffer
but if he be innocent who have do it
ah
who
i would call your attention very particularly to two point
one be that the murder man have an appointment with someone at the pool and that the someone could not have be his son for his son be away and he do not know when he would return
the second be that the murder man be hear to cry 'cooee '
before he know that his son have return
those be the crucial point upon which the case depend
and now let us talk about george meredith if you please and we shall leave all minor matter until to morrow
there be no rain as holmes have foretell and the morning break bright and cloudless
at nine o'clock lestrade call for us with the carriage and we set off for hatherley farm and the boscombe pool
there be serious news this morning lestrade observe
it be say that mr
turner of the hall be so ill that his life be despair of
an elderly man i presume
say holmes
about sixty but his constitution have be shatter by his life abroad and he have be in fail health for some time
this business have have a very bad effect upon him
he be an old friend of mccarthy's and i may add a great benefactor to him for i have learn that he give him hatherley farm rent free
indeed
that be interest say holmes
oh yes
in a hundred other ways he have help him
everybody about here speak of his kindness to him
really
do it not strike you as a little singular that this mccarthy who appear to have have little of his own and to have be under such obligations to turner should still talk of marry his son to turner's daughter who be presumably heiress to the estate and that in such a very cocksure manner as if it be merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow
it be the more strange since we know that turner himself be averse to the idea
the daughter tell us as much
do you not deduce something from that
we have get to the deductions and the inferences say lestrade wink at me
i find it hard enough to tackle facts holmes without fly away after theories and fancy
you be right say holmes demurely you do find it very hard to tackle the facts
anyhow i have grasp one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of reply lestrade with some warmth
and that be that mccarthy senior meet his death from mccarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary be the merest moonshine
well moonshine be a brighter thing than fog say holmes laugh
but i be very much mistake if this be not hatherley farm upon the leave
yes that be it
it be a widespread comfortable look build two storied slate roof with great yellow blotch of lichen upon the grey wall
the draw blind and the smokeless chimneys however give it a stricken look as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it
we call at the door when the maid at holmes' request show us the boot which her master wear at the time of his death and also a pair of the son's though not the pair which he have then have
have measure these very carefully from seven or eight different point holmes desire to be lead to the court yard from which we all follow the wind track which lead to boscombe pool
sherlock holmes be transform when he be hot upon such a scent as this
men who have only know the quiet thinker and logician of baker street would have fail to recognise him
his face flush and darken
his brows be draw into two hard black line while his eye shine out from beneath them with a steely glitter
his face be bend downward his shoulder bow his lips compress and the vein stand out like whipcord in his long sinewy neck
his nostrils seem to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase and his mind be so absolutely concentrate upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears or at the most only provoke a quick impatient snarl in reply
swiftly and silently he make his way along the track which run through the meadows and so by way of the woods to the boscombe pool
it be damp marshy grind as be all that district and there be mark of many feet both upon the path and amid the short grass which bound it on either side
sometimes holmes would hurry on sometimes stop dead and once he make quite a little detour into the meadow
lestrade and i walk behind him the detective indifferent and contemptuous while i watch my friend with the interest which spring from the conviction that every one of his action be direct towards a definite end
the boscombe pool which be a little reed gird sheet of water some fifty yards across be situate at the boundary between the hatherley farm and the private park of the wealthy mr
turner
above the woods which line it upon the farther side we could see the red jut pinnacle which mark the site of the rich landowner's dwell
on the hatherley side of the pool the woods grow very thick and there be a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty pace across between the edge of the tree and the reeds which line the lake
lestrade show us the exact spot at which the body have be find and indeed so moist be the grind that i could plainly see the trace which have be leave by the fall of the stricken man
to holmes as i could see by his eager face and peer eye very many other things be to be read upon the trample grass
he run round like a dog who be pick up a scent and then turn upon my companion
what do you go into the pool for
he ask
i fish about with a rake
i think there might be some weapon or other trace
but how on earth oh tut tut
i have no time
that leave foot of yours with its inward twist be all over the place
a mole could trace it and there it vanish among the reeds
oh how simple it would all have be have i be here before they come like a herd of buffalo and wallow all over it
here be where the party with the lodge keeper come and they have cover all track for six or eight feet round the body
but here be three separate track of the same feet
he draw out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view talk all the time rather to himself than to us
these be young mccarthy's feet
twice he be walk and once he run swiftly so that the sole be deeply mark and the heel hardly visible
that bear out his story
he run when he saw his father on the grind
then here be the father's feet as he pace up and down
what be this then
it be the butt end of the gun as the son stand listen
and this
ha ha
what have we here
tiptoe
tiptoe
square too quite unusual boot
they come they go they come again of course that be for the cloak
now where do they come from
he run up and down sometimes lose sometimes find the track until we be well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech the largest tree in the neighbourhood
holmes trace his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction
for a long time he remain there turn over the leave and dry stick gather up what seem to me to be dust into an envelope and examine with his lens not only the grind but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach
a jag stone be lie among the moss and this also he carefully examine and retain
then he follow a pathway through the wood until he come to the highroad where all trace be lose
it have be a case of considerable interest he remark return to his natural manner
i fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge
i think that i will go in and have a word with moran and perhaps write a little note
have do that we may drive back to our luncheon
you may walk to the cab and i shall be with you presently
it be about ten minutes before we regain our cab and drive back into ross holmes still carry with him the stone which he have pick up in the wood
this may interest you lestrade he remark hold it out
the murder be do with it
i see no mark
there be none
how do you know then
the grass be grow under it
it have only lie there a few days
there be no sign of a place whence it have be take
it correspond with the injuries
there be no sign of any other weapon
and the murderer
be a tall man leave hand limp with the right leg wear thick sole shoot boot and a grey cloak smoke indian cigars use a cigar holder and carry a blunt pen knife in his pocket
there be several other indications but these may be enough to aid us in our search
lestrade laugh
i be afraid that i be still a sceptic he say
theories be all very well but we have to deal with a hard head british jury
nous verrons answer holmes calmly
you work your own method and i shall work mine
i shall be busy this afternoon and shall probably return to london by the even train
and leave your case unfinished
no finish
but the mystery
it be solve
who be the criminal then
the gentleman i describe
but who be he
surely it would not be difficult to find out
this be not such a populous neighbourhood
lestrade shrug his shoulder
i be a practical man he say and i really cannot undertake to go about the country look for a leave hand gentleman with a game leg
i should become the laugh stock of scotland yard
all right say holmes quietly
i have give you the chance
here be your lodge
good bye
i shall drop you a line before i leave
have leave lestrade at his room we drive to our hotel where we find lunch upon the table
holmes be silent and bury in think with a pain expression upon his face as one who find himself in a perplex position
look here watson he say when the cloth be clear just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little
i don't know quite what to do and i should value your advice
light a cigar and let me expound
pray do so
well now in consider this case there be two point about young mccarthy's narrative which strike us both instantly although they impress me in his favour and you against him
one be the fact that his father should accord to his account cry 'cooee '
before see him
the other be his singular die reference to a rat
he mumble several word you understand but that be all that catch the son's ear
now from this double point our research must commence and we will begin it by presume that what the lad say be absolutely true
what of this 'cooee '
then
well obviously it could not have be mean for the son
the son as far as he know be in bristol
it be mere chance that he be within earshot
the 'cooee '
be mean to attract the attention of whoever it be that he have the appointment with
but 'cooee' be a distinctly australian cry and one which be use between australians
there be a strong presumption that the person whom mccarthy expect to meet him at boscombe pool be someone who have be in australia
what of the rat then
sherlock holmes take a fold paper from his pocket and flatten it out on the table
this be a map of the colony of victoria he say
i wire to bristol for it last night
he put his hand over part of the map
what do you read
arat i read
and now
he raise his hand
ballarat
quite so
that be the word the man utter and of which his son only catch the last two syllables
he be try to utter the name of his murderer
so and so of ballarat
it be wonderful
i exclaim
it be obvious
and now you see i have narrow the field down considerably
the possession of a grey garment be a third point which grant the son's statement to be correct be a certainty
we have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an australian from ballarat with a grey cloak
certainly
and one who be at home in the district for the pool can only be approach by the farm or by the estate where strangers could hardly wander
quite so
then come our expedition of to day
by an examination of the grind i gain the trifle detail which i give to that imbecile lestrade as to the personality of the criminal
but how do you gain them
you know my method
it be found upon the observation of trifle
his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride
his boot too might be tell from their trace
yes they be peculiar boot
but his lameness
the impression of his right foot be always less distinct than his leave
he put less weight upon it
why
because he limp he be lame
but his leave handedness
you be yourself strike by the nature of the injury as record by the surgeon at the inquest
the blow be strike from immediately behind and yet be upon the leave side
now how can that be unless it be by a leave hand man
he have stand behind that tree during the interview between the father and son
he have even smoke there
i find the ash of a cigar which my special knowledge of tobacco ash enable me to pronounce as an indian cigar
i have as you know devote some attention to this and write a little monograph on the ash of different varieties of pipe cigar and cigarette tobacco
have find the ash i then look round and discover the stump among the moss where he have toss it
it be an indian cigar of the variety which be roll in rotterdam
and the cigar holder
i could see that the end have not be in his mouth
therefore he use a holder
the tip have be cut off not bite off but the cut be not a clean one so i deduce a blunt pen knife
holmes i say you have draw a net round this man from which he cannot escape and you have save an innocent human life as truly as if you have cut the cord which be hang him
i see the direction in which all this point
the culprit be mr
john turner cry the hotel waiter open the door of our sit room and usher in a visitor
the man who enter be a strange and impressive figure
his slow limp step and bow shoulder give the appearance of decrepitude and yet his hard deep line craggy feature and his enormous limbs show that he be possess of unusual strength of body and of character
his tangle beard grizzle hair and outstanding droop eyebrows combine to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance but his face be of an ashen white while his lips and the corner of his nostrils be ting with a shade of blue
it be clear to me at a glance that he be in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease
pray sit down on the sofa say holmes gently
you have my note
yes the lodge keeper bring it up
you say that you wish to see me here to avoid scandal
i think people would talk if i go to the hall
and why do you wish to see me
he look across at my companion with despair in his weary eye as though his question be already answer
yes say holmes answer the look rather than the word
it be so
i know all about mccarthy
the old man sink his face in his hand
god help me
he cry
but i would not have let the young man come to harm
i give you my word that i would have speak out if it go against him at the assizes
i be glad to hear you say so say holmes gravely
i would have speak now have it not be for my dear girl
it would break her heart it will break her heart when she hear that i be arrest
it may not come to that say holmes
what
i be no official agent
i understand that it be your daughter who require my presence here and i be act in her interest
young mccarthy must be get off however
i be a die man say old turner
i have have diabetes for years
my doctor say it be a question whether i shall live a month
yet i would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol
holmes rise and sit down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him
just tell us the truth he say
i shall jot down the facts
you will sign it and watson here can witness it
then i could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young mccarthy
i promise you that i shall not use it unless it be absolutely need
it's as well say the old man it's a question whether i shall live to the assizes so it matter little to me but i should wish to spare alice the shock
and now i will make the thing clear to you it have be a long time in the act but will not take me long to tell
you didn't know this dead man mccarthy
he be a devil incarnate
i tell you that
god keep you out of the clutch of such a man as he
his grip have be upon me these twenty years and he have blast my life
i'll tell you first how i come to be in his power
it be in the early ' 's at the diggings
i be a young chap then hot blood and reckless ready to turn my hand at anything i get among bad companion take to drink have no luck with my claim take to the bush and in a word become what you would call over here a highway robber
there be six of us and we have a wild free life of it stick up a station from time to time or stop the wagons on the road to the diggings
black jack of ballarat be the name i go under and our party be still remember in the colony as the ballarat gang
one day a gold convoy come down from ballarat to melbourne and we lay in wait for it and attack it
there be six troopers and six of us so it be a close thing but we empty four of their saddle at the first volley
three of our boys be kill however before we get the swag
i put my pistol to the head of the wagon driver who be this very man mccarthy
i wish to the lord that i have shoot him then but i spar him though i saw his wicked little eye fix on my face as though to remember every feature
we get away with the gold become wealthy men and make our way over to england without be suspect
there i part from my old pal and determine to settle down to a quiet and respectable life
i buy this estate which chance to be in the market and i set myself to do a little good with my money to make up for the way in which i have earn it
i marry too and though my wife die young she leave me my dear little alice
even when she be just a baby her wee hand seem to lead me down the right path as nothing else have ever do
in a word i turn over a new leaf and do my best to make up for the past
all be go well when mccarthy lay his grip upon me
i have go up to town about an investment and i meet him in regent street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot
'here we be jack ' say he touch me on the arm 'we'll be as good as a family to you
there's two of us me and my son and you can have the keep of us
if you don't it's a fine law abide country be england and there's always a policeman within hail '
well down they come to the west country there be no shake them off and there they have live rent free on my best land ever since
there be no rest for me no peace no forgetfulness turn where i would there be his cunning grin face at my elbow
it grow worse as alice grow up for he soon saw i be more afraid of her know my past than of the police
whatever he want he must have and whatever it be i give him without question land money house until at last he ask a thing which i could not give
he ask for alice
his son you see have grow up and so have my girl and as i be know to be in weak health it seem a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property
but there i be firm
i would not have his curse stock mix with mine not that i have any dislike to the lad but his blood be in him and that be enough
i stand firm
mccarthy threaten
i brave him to do his worst
we be to meet at the pool midway between our house to talk it over
when i go down there i find him talk with his son so i smoke a cigar and wait behind a tree until he should be alone
but as i listen to his talk all that be black and bitter in me seem to come uppermost
he be urge his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she be a slut from off the streets
it drive me mad to think that i and all that i hold most dear should be in the power of such a man as this
could i not snap the bond
i be already a die and a desperate man
though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb i know that my own fate be seal
but my memory and my girl
both could be save if i could but silence that foul tongue
i do it mr
holmes
i would do it again
deeply as i have sin i have lead a life of martyrdom to atone for it
but that my girl should be entangle in the same mesh which hold me be more than i could suffer
i strike him down with no more compunction than if he have be some foul and venomous beast
his cry bring back his son but i have gain the cover of the wood though i be force to go back to fetch the cloak which i have drop in my flight
that be the true story gentlemen of all that occur
well it be not for me to judge you say holmes as the old man sign the statement which have be draw out
i pray that we may never be expose to such a temptation
i pray not sir
and what do you intend to do
in view of your health nothing
you be yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the assizes
i will keep your confession and if mccarthy be condemn i shall be force to use it
if not it shall never be see by mortal eye and your secret whether you be alive or dead shall be safe with us
farewell then say the old man solemnly
your own deathbeds when they come will be the easier for the think of the peace which you have give to mine
totter and shake in all his giant frame he stumble slowly from the room
god help us
say holmes after a long silence
why do fate play such trick with poor helpless worm
i never hear of such a case as this that i do not think of baxter's word and say 'there but for the grace of god go sherlock holmes '
jam mccarthy be acquit at the assizes on the strength of a number of objections which have be draw out by holmes and submit to the defend counsel
old turner live for seven months after our interview but he be now dead and there be every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rest upon their past
when i glance over my note and record of the sherlock holmes case between the years ' and ' i be face by so many which present strange and interest feature that it be no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave
some however have already gain publicity through the paper and others have not offer a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possess in so high a degree and which it be the object of these paper to illustrate
some too have baffle his analytical skill and would be as narratives beginnings without an end while others have be but partially clear up and have their explanations found rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which be so dear to him
there be however one of these last which be so remarkable in its detail and so startle in its result that i be tempt to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there be point in connection with it which never have be and probably never will be entirely clear up
the year ' furnish us with a long series of case of greater or less interest of which i retain the record
among my head under this one twelve months i find an account of the adventure of the paradol chamber of the amateur mendicant society who hold a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse of the facts connect with the loss of the british barque sophy anderson of the singular adventure of the grice patersons in the island of uffa and finally of the camberwell poison case
in the latter as may be remember sherlock holmes be able by wind up the dead man's watch to prove that it have be wind up two hours before and that therefore the decease have go to bed within that time a deduction which be of the greatest importance in clear up the case
all these i may sketch out at some future date but none of them present such singular feature as the strange train of circumstances which i have now take up my pen to describe
it be in the latter days of september and the equinoctial gales have set in with exceptional violence
all day the wind have scream and the rain have beat against the windows so that even here in the heart of great hand make london we be force to raise our mind for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental force which shriek at mankind through the bar of his civilisation like untamed beasts in a cage
as even draw in the storm grow higher and louder and the wind cry and sob like a child in the chimney
sherlock holmes sit moodily at one side of the fireplace cross index his record of crime while i at the other be deep in one of clark russell's fine sea stories until the howl of the gale from without seem to blend with the text and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea wave
my wife be on a visit to her mother's and for a few days i be a dweller once more in my old quarter at baker street
why say i glance up at my companion that be surely the bell
who could come to night
some friend of yours perhaps
except yourself i have none he answer
i do not encourage visitors
a client then
if so it be a serious case
nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour
but i take it that it be more likely to be some crony of the landlady's
sherlock holmes be wrong in his conjecture however for there come a step in the passage and a tap at the door
he stretch out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit
come in
say he
the man who enter be young some two and twenty at the outside well groom and trimly clothe with something of refinement and delicacy in his bear
the stream umbrella which he hold in his hand and his long shin waterproof tell of the fierce weather through which he have come
he look about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp and i could see that his face be pale and his eye heavy like those of a man who be weigh down with some great anxiety
i owe you an apology he say raise his golden pince nez to his eye
i trust that i be not intrude
i fear that i have bring some trace of the storm and rain into your snug chamber
give me your coat and umbrella say holmes
they may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently
you have come up from the south west i see
yes from horsham
that clay and chalk mixture which i see upon your toe cap be quite distinctive
i have come for advice
that be easily get
and help
that be not always so easy
i have hear of you mr
holmes
i hear from major prendergast how you save him in the tankerville club scandal
ah of course
he be wrongfully accuse of cheat at card
he say that you could solve anything
he say too much
that you be never beat
i have be beat four time three time by men and once by a woman
but what be that compare with the number of your successes
it be true that i have be generally successful
then you may be so with me
i beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some detail as to your case
it be no ordinary one
none of those which come to me be
i be the last court of appeal
and yet i question sir whether in all your experience you have ever listen to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happen in my own family
you fill me with interest say holmes
pray give us the essential facts from the commencement and i can afterwards question you as to those detail which seem to me to be most important
the young man pull his chair up and push his wet feet out towards the blaze
my name say he be john openshaw but my own affairs have as far as i can understand little to do with this awful business
it be a hereditary matter so in order to give you an idea of the facts i must go back to the commencement of the affair
you must know that my grandfather have two sons my uncle elias and my father joseph
my father have a small factory at coventry which he enlarge at the time of the invention of bicycle
he be a patentee of the openshaw unbreakable tire and his business meet with such success that he be able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence
my uncle elias emigrate to america when he be a young man and become a planter in florida where he be report to have do very well
at the time of the war he fight in jackson's army and afterwards under hood where he rise to be a colonel
when lee lay down his arm my uncle return to his plantation where he remain for three or four years
about or he come back to europe and take a small estate in sussex near horsham
he have make a very considerable fortune in the state and his reason for leave them be his aversion to the negroes and his dislike of the republican policy in extend the franchise to them
he be a singular man fierce and quick temper very foul mouth when he be angry and of a most retire disposition
during all the years that he live at horsham i doubt if ever he set foot in the town
he have a garden and two or three field round his house and there he would take his exercise though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room
he drink a great deal of brandy and smoke very heavily but he would see no society and do not want any friends not even his own brother
he didn't mind me in fact he take a fancy to me for at the time when he saw me first i be a youngster of twelve or so
this would be in the year after he have be eight or nine years in england
he beg my father to let me live with him and he be very kind to me in his way
when he be sober he use to be fond of play backgammon and draught with me and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople so that by the time that i be sixteen i be quite master of the house
i keep all the key and could go where i like and do what i like so long as i do not disturb him in his privacy
there be one singular exception however for he have a single room a lumber room up among the attics which be invariably lock and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter
with a boy's curiosity i have peep through the keyhole but i be never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundle as would be expect in such a room
one day it be in march a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel's plate
it be not a common thing for him to receive letter for his bill be all pay in ready money and he have no friends of any sort
'from india '
say he as he take it up 'pondicherry postmark
what can this be '
open it hurriedly out there jump five little dry orange pip which patter down upon his plate
i begin to laugh at this but the laugh be strike from my lips at the sight of his face
his lip have fall his eye be protrude his skin the colour of putty and he glare at the envelope which he still hold in his tremble hand 'k
k
k '
he shriek and then 'my god my god my sin have overtake me '
'what be it uncle '
i cry
'death ' say he and rise from the table he retire to his room leave me palpitate with horror
i take up the envelope and saw scrawl in red ink upon the inner flap just above the gum the letter k three time repeat
there be nothing else save the five dry pip
what could be the reason of his overpower terror
i leave the breakfast table and as i ascend the stair i meet him come down with an old rusty key which must have belong to the attic in one hand and a small brass box like a cashbox in the other
'they may do what they like but i'll checkmate them still ' say he with an oath
'tell mary that i shall want a fire in my room to day and send down to fordham the horsham lawyer '
i do as he order and when the lawyer arrive i be ask to step up to the room
the fire be burn brightly and in the grate there be a mass of black fluffy ash as of burn paper while the brass box stand open and empty beside it
as i glance at the box i notice with a start that upon the lid be print the treble k which i have read in the morning upon the envelope
'i wish you john ' say my uncle 'to witness my will
i leave my estate with all its advantage and all its disadvantage to my brother your father whence it will no doubt descend to you
if you can enjoy it in peace well and good
if you find you cannot take my advice my boy and leave it to your deadliest enemy
i be sorry to give you such a two edge thing but i can't say what turn things be go to take
kindly sign the paper where mr
fordham show you '
i sign the paper as direct and the lawyer take it away with him
the singular incident make as you may think the deepest impression upon me and i ponder over it and turn it every way in my mind without be able to make anything of it
yet i could not shake off the vague feel of dread which it leave behind though the sensation grow less keen as the weeks pass and nothing happen to disturb the usual routine of our live
i could see a change in my uncle however
he drink more than ever and he be less incline for any sort of society
most of his time he would spend in his room with the door lock upon the inside but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand scream out that he be afraid of no man and that he be not to be cooped up like a sheep in a pen by man or devil
when these hot fit be over however he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lie at the root of his soul
at such time i have see his face even on a cold day glisten with moisture as though it be new raise from a basin
well to come to an end of the matter mr
holmes and not to abuse your patience there come a night when he make one of those drunken sallies from which he never come back
we find him when we go to search for him face downward in a little green scum pool which lay at the foot of the garden
there be no sign of any violence and the water be but two feet deep so that the jury have regard to his know eccentricity bring in a verdict of 'suicide '
but i who know how he wince from the very think of death have much ado to persuade myself that he have go out of his way to meet it
the matter pass however and my father enter into possession of the estate and of some pound which lay to his credit at the bank
one moment holmes interpose your statement be i foresee one of the most remarkable to which i have ever listen
let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter and the date of his suppose suicide
the letter arrive on march
his death be seven weeks later upon the night of may 2nd
thank you
pray proceed
when my father take over the horsham property he at my request make a careful examination of the attic which have be always lock up
we find the brass box there although its content have be destroy
on the inside of the cover be a paper label with the initial of k k k repeat upon it and 'letters memoranda receipt and a register' write beneath
these we presume indicate the nature of the paper which have be destroy by colonel openshaw
for the rest there be nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scatter paper and note book bear upon my uncle's life in america
some of them be of the war time and show that he have do his duty well and have bear the repute of a brave soldier
others be of a date during the reconstruction of the southern state and be mostly concern with politics for he have evidently take a strong part in oppose the carpet bag politicians who have be send down from the north
well it be the begin of ' when my father come to live at horsham and all go as well as possible with us until the january of '
on the fourth day after the new year i hear my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sit together at the breakfast table
there he be sit with a newly open envelope in one hand and five dry orange pip in the outstretched palm of the other one
he have always laugh at what he call my cock and bull story about the colonel but he look very scar and puzzle now that the same thing have come upon himself
'why what on earth do this mean john '
he stammer
my heart have turn to lead
'it be k k k ' say i
he look inside the envelope
'so it be ' he cry
'here be the very letter
but what be this write above them '
'put the paper on the sundial ' i read peep over his shoulder
'what paper
what sundial '
he ask
'the sundial in the garden
there be no other ' say i 'but the paper must be those that be destroy '
'pooh '
say he grip hard at his courage
'we be in a civilise land here and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind
where do the thing come from '
'from dundee ' i answer glance at the postmark
'some preposterous practical joke ' say he
'what have i to do with sundials and paper
i shall take no notice of such nonsense '
'i should certainly speak to the police ' i say
'and be laugh at for my pain
nothing of the sort '
'then let me do so '
'no i forbid you
i won't have a fuss make about such nonsense '
it be in vain to argue with him for he be a very obstinate man
i go about however with a heart which be full of forebode
on the third day after the come of the letter my father go from home to visit an old friend of his major freebody who be in command of one of the fort upon portsdown hill
i be glad that he should go for it seem to me that he be farther from danger when he be away from home
in that however i be in error
upon the second day of his absence i receive a telegram from the major implore me to come at once
my father have fall over one of the deep chalk pit which abound in the neighbourhood and be lie senseless with a shatter skull
i hurry to him but he pass away without have ever recover his consciousness
he have as it appear be return from fareham in the twilight and as the country be unknown to him and the chalk pit unfenced the jury have no hesitation in bring in a verdict of 'death from accidental cause '
carefully as i examine every fact connect with his death i be unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder
there be no sign of violence no footmarks no robbery no record of strangers have be see upon the roads
and yet i need not tell you that my mind be far from at ease and that i be well nigh certain that some foul plot have be weave round him
in this sinister way i come into my inheritance
you will ask me why i do not dispose of it
i answer because i be well convince that our trouble be in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle's life and that the danger would be as press in one house as in another
it be in january ' that my poor father meet his end and two years and eight months have elapse since then
during that time i have live happily at horsham and i have begin to hope that this curse have pass away from the family and that it have end with the last generation
i have begin to take comfort too soon however yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it have come upon my father
the young man take from his waistcoat a crumple envelope and turn to the table he shake out upon it five little dry orange pip
this be the envelope he continue
the postmark be london eastern division
within be the very word which be upon my father's last message 'k
k
k
' and then 'put the paper on the sundial '
what have you do
ask holmes
nothing
nothing
to tell the truth he sink his face into his thin white hand i have felt helpless
i have felt like one of those poor rabbit when the snake be writhe towards it
i seem to be in the grasp of some resistless inexorable evil which no foresight and no precautions can guard against
tut
tut
cry sherlock holmes
you must act man or you be lose
nothing but energy can save you
this be no time for despair
i have see the police
ah
but they listen to my story with a smile
i be convince that the inspector have form the opinion that the letter be all practical joke and that the deaths of my relations be really accidents as the jury state and be not to be connect with the warn
holmes shake his clench hand in the air
incredible imbecility
he cry
they have however allow me a policeman who may remain in the house with me
have he come with you to night
no
his order be to stay in the house
again holmes rave in the air
why do you come to me he cry and above all why do you not come at once
i do not know
it be only to day that i speak to major prendergast about my trouble and be advise by him to come to you
it be really two days since you have the letter
we should have act before this
you have no further evidence i suppose than that which you have place before us no suggestive detail which might help us
there be one thing say john openshaw
he rummage in his coat pocket and draw out a piece of discolour blue tint paper he lay it out upon the table
i have some remembrance say he that on the day when my uncle burn the paper i observe that the small unburned margins which lay amid the ash be of this particular colour
i find this single sheet upon the floor of his room and i be incline to think that it may be one of the paper which have perhaps flutter out from among the others and in that way have escape destruction
beyond the mention of pip i do not see that it help us much
i think myself that it be a page from some private diary
the write be undoubtedly my uncle's
holmes move the lamp and we both bend over the sheet of paper which show by its rag edge that it have indeed be tear from a book
it be head march and beneath be the follow enigmatical notice 4th
hudson come
same old platform
7th
set the pip on mccauley paramore and john swain of st
augustine
9th
mccauley clear
10th
john swain clear
12th
visit paramore
all well
thank you
say holmes fold up the paper and return it to our visitor
and now you must on no account lose another instant
we cannot spare time even to discuss what you have tell me
you must get home instantly and act
what shall i do
there be but one thing to do
it must be do at once
you must put this piece of paper which you have show us into the brass box which you have describe
you must also put in a note to say that all the other paper be burn by your uncle and that this be the only one which remain
you must assert that in such word as will carry conviction with them
have do this you must at once put the box out upon the sundial as direct
do you understand
entirely
do not think of revenge or anything of the sort at present
i think that we may gain that by mean of the law but we have our web to weave while theirs be already weave
the first consideration be to remove the press danger which threaten you
the second be to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty party
i thank you say the young man rise and pull on his overcoat
you have give me fresh life and hope
i shall certainly do as you advise
do not lose an instant
and above all take care of yourself in the meanwhile for i do not think that there can be a doubt that you be threaten by a very real and imminent danger
how do you go back
by train from waterloo
it be not yet nine
the streets will be crowd so i trust that you may be in safety
and yet you cannot guard yourself too closely
i be arm
that be well
to morrow i shall set to work upon your case
i shall see you at horsham then
no your secret lie in london
it be there that i shall seek it
then i shall call upon you in a day or in two days with news as to the box and the paper
i shall take your advice in every particular
he shake hand with us and take his leave
outside the wind still scream and the rain splash and patter against the windows
this strange wild story seem to have come to us from amid the mad elements blow in upon us like a sheet of sea weed in a gale and now to have be reabsorb by them once more
sherlock holmes sit for some time in silence with his head sink forward and his eye bend upon the red glow of the fire
then he light his pipe and lean back in his chair he watch the blue smoke ring as they chase each other up to the ceiling
i think watson he remark at last that of all our case we have have none more fantastic than this
save perhaps the sign of four
well yes
save perhaps that
and yet this john openshaw seem to me to be walk amid even greater peril than do the sholtos
but have you i ask form any definite conception as to what these peril be
there can be no question as to their nature he answer
then what be they
who be this k k k and why do he pursue this unhappy family
sherlock holmes close his eye and place his elbow upon the arm of his chair with his finger tip together
the ideal reasoner he remark would when he have once be show a single fact in all its bear deduce from it not only all the chain of events which lead up to it but also all the result which would follow from it
as cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone so the observer who have thoroughly understand one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones both before and after
we have not yet grasp the result which the reason alone can attain to
problems may be solve in the study which have baffle all those who have seek a solution by the aid of their sense
to carry the art however to its highest pitch it be necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge and this in itself imply as you will readily see a possession of all knowledge which even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias be a somewhat rare accomplishment
it be not so impossible however that a man should possess all knowledge which be likely to be useful to him in his work and this i have endeavour in my case to do
if i remember rightly you on one occasion in the early days of our friendship define my limit in a very precise fashion
yes i answer laugh
it be a singular document
philosophy astronomy and politics be mark at zero i remember
botany variable geology profound as regard the mud stain from any region within fifty miles of town chemistry eccentric anatomy unsystematic sensational literature and crime record unique violin player boxer swordsman lawyer and self poisoner by cocaine and tobacco
those i think be the main point of my analysis
holmes grin at the last item
well he say i say now as i say then that a man should keep his little brain attic stock with all the furniture that he be likely to use and the rest he can put away in the lumber room of his library where he can get it if he want it
now for such a case as the one which have be submit to us to night we need certainly to muster all our resources
kindly hand me down the letter k of the 'american encyclopaedia' which stand upon the shelf beside you
thank you
now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduce from it
in the first place we may start with a strong presumption that colonel openshaw have some very strong reason for leave america
men at his time of life do not change all their habit and exchange willingly the charm climate of florida for the lonely life of an english provincial town
his extreme love of solitude in england suggest the idea that he be in fear of someone or something so we may assume as a work hypothesis that it be fear of someone or something which drive him from america
as to what it be he fear we can only deduce that by consider the formidable letter which be receive by himself and his successors
do you remark the postmark of those letter
the first be from pondicherry the second from dundee and the third from london
from east london
what do you deduce from that
they be all seaports
that the writer be on board of a ship
excellent
we have already a clue
there can be no doubt that the probability the strong probability be that the writer be on board of a ship
and now let us consider another point
in the case of pondicherry seven weeks elapse between the threat and its fulfilment in dundee it be only some three or four days
do that suggest anything
a greater distance to travel
but the letter have also a greater distance to come
then i do not see the point
there be at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men be be a sail ship
it look as if they always send their singular warn or token before them when start upon their mission
you see how quickly the deed follow the sign when it come from dundee
if they have come from pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrive almost as soon as their letter
but as a matter of fact seven weeks elapse
i think that those seven weeks represent the difference between the mail boat which bring the letter and the sail vessel which bring the writer
it be possible
more than that
it be probable
and now you see the deadly urgency of this new case and why i urge young openshaw to caution
the blow have always fall at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance
but this one come from london and therefore we cannot count upon delay
good god
i cry
what can it mean this relentless persecution
the paper which openshaw carry be obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sail ship
i think that it be quite clear that there must be more than one of them
a single man could not have carry out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner's jury
there must have be several in it and they must have be men of resource and determination
their paper they mean to have be the holder of them who it may
in this way you see k k k cease to be the initial of an individual and become the badge of a society
but of what society
have you never say sherlock holmes bend forward and sink his voice have you never hear of the ku klux klan
i never have
holmes turn over the leave of the book upon his knee
here it be say he presently 'ku klux klan
a name derive from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produce by cock a rifle
this terrible secret society be form by some ex confederate soldier in the southern state after the civil war and it rapidly form local branch in different part of the country notably in tennessee louisiana the carolinas georgia and florida
its power be use for political purpose principally for the terrorise of the negro voters and the murder and drive from the country of those who be oppose to its view
its outrage be usually precede by a warn send to the mark man in some fantastic but generally recognise shape a sprig of oak leave in some part melon seed or orange pip in others
on receive this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways or might fly from the country
if he brave the matter out death would unfailingly come upon him and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner
so perfect be the organisation of the society and so systematic its methods that there be hardly a case upon record where any man succeed in brave it with impunity or in which any of its outrage be trace home to the perpetrators
for some years the organisation flourish in spite of the efforts of the unite state government and of the better class of the community in the south
eventually in the year the movement rather suddenly collapse although there have be sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date '
you will observe say holmes lay down the volume that the sudden break up of the society be coincident with the disappearance of openshaw from america with their paper
it may well have be cause and effect
it be no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirit upon their track
you can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the south and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it be recover
then the page we have see be such as we might expect
it run if i remember right 'sent the pip to a b and c' that be send the society's warn to them
then there be successive entries that a and b clear or leave the country and finally that c be visit with i fear a sinister result for c well i think doctor that we may let some light into this dark place and i believe that the only chance young openshaw have in the meantime be to do what i have tell him
there be nothing more to be say or to be do to night so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men
it have clear in the morning and the sun be shin with a subdue brightness through the dim veil which hang over the great city
sherlock holmes be already at breakfast when i come down
you will excuse me for not wait for you say he i have i foresee a very busy day before me in look into this case of young openshaw's
what step will you take
i ask
it will very much depend upon the result of my first inquiries
i may have to go down to horsham after all
you will not go there first
no i shall commence with the city
just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee
as i wait i lift the unopened newspaper from the table and glance my eye over it
it rest upon a head which send a chill to my heart
holmes i cry you be too late
ah
say he lay down his cup i fear as much
how be it do
he speak calmly but i could see that he be deeply move
my eye catch the name of openshaw and the head 'tragedy near waterloo bridge '
here be the account between nine and ten last night police constable cook of the h division on duty near waterloo bridge hear a cry for help and a splash in the water
the night however be extremely dark and stormy so that in spite of the help of several passers by it be quite impossible to effect a rescue
the alarm however be give and by the aid of the water police the body be eventually recover
it prove to be that of a young gentleman whose name as it appear from an envelope which be find in his pocket be john openshaw and whose residence be near horsham
it be conjecture that he may have be hurry down to catch the last train from waterloo station and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he miss his path and walk over the edge of one of the small land place for river steamboats
the body exhibit no trace of violence and there can be no doubt that the decease have be the victim of an unfortunate accident which should have the effect of call the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside land stag
we sit in silence for some minutes holmes more depress and shake than i have ever see him
that hurt my pride watson he say at last
it be a petty feel no doubt but it hurt my pride
it become a personal matter with me now and if god send me health i shall set my hand upon this gang
that he should come to me for help and that i should send him away to his death
he spring from his chair and pace about the room in uncontrollable agitation with a flush upon his sallow cheek and a nervous clasp and unclasp of his long thin hand
they must be cunning devil he exclaim at last
how could they have decoy him down there
the embankment be not on the direct line to the station
the bridge no doubt be too crowd even on such a night for their purpose
well watson we shall see who will win in the long run
i be go out now
to the police
no i shall be my own police
when i have spin the web they may take the fly but not before
all day i be engage in my professional work and it be late in the even before i return to baker street
sherlock holmes have not come back yet
it be nearly ten o'clock before he enter look pale and wear
he walk up to the sideboard and tear a piece from the loaf he devour it voraciously wash it down with a long draught of water
you be hungry i remark
starve
it have escape my memory
i have have nothing since breakfast
nothing
not a bite
i have no time to think of it
and how have you succeed
well
you have a clue
i have them in the hollow of my hand
young openshaw shall not long remain unavenged
why watson let us put their own devilish trade mark upon them
it be well think of
what do you mean
he take an orange from the cupboard and tear it to piece he squeeze out the pip upon the table
of these he take five and thrust them into an envelope
on the inside of the flap he write s h for j
o
then he seal it and address it to captain jam calhoun barque 'lone star ' savannah georgia
that will await him when he enter port say he chuckle
it may give him a sleepless night
he will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as openshaw do before him
and who be this captain calhoun
the leader of the gang
i shall have the others but he first
how do you trace it then
he take a large sheet of paper from his pocket all cover with date and name
i have spend the whole day say he over lloyd's register and file of the old paper follow the future career of every vessel which touch at pondicherry in january and february in '
there be thirty six ship of fair tonnage which be report there during those months
of these one the 'lone star ' instantly attract my attention since although it be report as have clear from london the name be that which be give to one of the state of the union
texas i think
i be not and be not sure which but i know that the ship must have an american origin
what then
i search the dundee record and when i find that the barque 'lone star' be there in january ' my suspicion become a certainty
i then inquire as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of london
yes
the 'lone star' have arrive here last week
i go down to the albert dock and find that she have be take down the river by the early tide this morning homeward bind to savannah
i wire to gravesend and learn that she have pass some time ago and as the wind be easterly i have no doubt that she be now past the goodwins and not very far from the isle of wight
what will you do then
oh i have my hand upon him
he and the two mat be as i learn the only native bear americans in the ship
the others be finns and germans
i know also that they be all three away from the ship last night
i have it from the stevedore who have be load their cargo
by the time that their sail ship reach savannah the mail boat will have carry this letter and the cable will have inform the police of savannah that these three gentlemen be badly want here upon a charge of murder
there be ever a flaw however in the best lay of human plan and the murderers of john openshaw be never to receive the orange pip which would show them that another as cunning and as resolute as themselves be upon their track
very long and very severe be the equinoctial gales that year
we wait long for news of the lone star of savannah but none ever reach us
we do at last hear that somewhere far out in the atlantic a shatter stern post of a boat be see swing in the trough of a wave with the letter l
s
carve upon it and that be all which we shall ever know of the fate of the lone star
on glance over my note of the seventy odd case in which i have during the last eight years study the methods of my friend sherlock holmes i find many tragic some comic a large number merely strange but none commonplace for work as he do rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth he refuse to associate himself with any investigation which do not tend towards the unusual and even the fantastic
of all these vary case however i cannot recall any which present more singular feature than that which be associate with the well know surrey family of the roylotts of stoke moran
the events in question occur in the early days of my association with holmes when we be share room as bachelor in baker street
it be possible that i might have place them upon record before but a promise of secrecy be make at the time from which i have only be free during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge be give
it be perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light for i have reason to know that there be widespread rumour as to the death of dr
grimesby roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth
it be early in april in the year ' that i wake one morning to find sherlock holmes stand fully dress by the side of my bed
he be a late riser as a rule and as the clock on the mantelpiece show me that it be only a quarter past seven i blink up at him in some surprise and perhaps just a little resentment for i be myself regular in my habit
very sorry to knock you up watson say he but it's the common lot this morning
mrs
hudson have be knock up she retort upon me and i on you
what be it then a fire
no a client
it seem that a young lady have arrive in a considerable state of excitement who insist upon see me
she be wait now in the sit room
now when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning and knock sleepy people up out of their bed i presume that it be something very press which they have to communicate
should it prove to be an interest case you would i be sure wish to follow it from the outset
i think at any rate that i should call you and give you the chance
my dear fellow i would not miss it for anything
i have no keener pleasure than in follow holmes in his professional investigations and in admire the rapid deductions as swift as intuitions and yet always found on a logical basis with which he unravel the problems which be submit to him
i rapidly throw on my clothe and be ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sit room
a lady dress in black and heavily veil who have be sit in the window rise as we enter
good morning madam say holmes cheerily
my name be sherlock holmes
this be my intimate friend and associate dr
watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself
ha
i be glad to see that mrs
hudson have have the good sense to light the fire
pray draw up to it and i shall order you a cup of hot coffee for i observe that you be shiver
it be not cold which make me shiver say the woman in a low voice change her seat as request
what then
it be fear mr
holmes
it be terror
she raise her veil as she speak and we could see that she be indeed in a pitiable state of agitation her face all draw and grey with restless frighten eye like those of some hunt animal
her feature and figure be those of a woman of thirty but her hair be shoot with premature grey and her expression be weary and haggard
sherlock holmes run her over with one of his quick all comprehensive glance
you must not fear say he soothingly bend forward and pat her forearm
we shall soon set matter right i have no doubt
you have come in by train this morning i see
you know me then
no but i observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your leave glove
you must have start early and yet you have a good drive in a dog cart along heavy roads before you reach the station
the lady give a violent start and star in bewilderment at my companion
there be no mystery my dear madam say he smile
the leave arm of your jacket be spatter with mud in no less than seven place
the mark be perfectly fresh
there be no vehicle save a dog cart which throw up mud in that way and then only when you sit on the leave hand side of the driver
whatever your reason may be you be perfectly correct say she
i start from home before six reach leatherhead at twenty past and come in by the first train to waterloo
sir i can stand this strain no longer i shall go mad if it continue
i have no one to turn to none save only one who care for me and he poor fellow can be of little aid
i have hear of you mr
holmes i have hear of you from mrs
farintosh whom you help in the hour of her sore need
it be from her that i have your address
oh sir do you not think that you could help me too and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surround me
at present it be out of my power to reward you for your service but in a month or six weeks i shall be marry with the control of my own income and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful
holmes turn to his desk and unlock it draw out a small case book which he consult
farintosh say he
ah yes i recall the case it be concern with an opal tiara
i think it be before your time watson
i can only say madam that i shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as i do to that of your friend
as to reward my profession be its own reward but you be at liberty to defray whatever expense i may be put to at the time which suit you best
and now i beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in form an opinion upon the matter
alas
reply our visitor the very horror of my situation lie in the fact that my fear be so vague and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small point which might seem trivial to another that even he to whom of all others i have a right to look for help and advice look upon all that i tell him about it as the fancy of a nervous woman
he do not say so but i can read it from his soothe answer and avert eye
but i have hear mr
holmes that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart
you may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me
i be all attention madam
my name be helen stoner and i be live with my stepfather who be the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in england the roylotts of stoke moran on the western border of surrey
holmes nod his head
the name be familiar to me say he
the family be at one time among the richest in england and the estates extend over the border into berkshire in the north and hampshire in the west
in the last century however four successive heirs be of a dissolute and wasteful disposition and the family ruin be eventually complete by a gambler in the days of the regency
nothing be leave save a few acres of grind and the two hundred year old house which be itself crush under a heavy mortgage
the last squire drag out his existence there live the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper but his only son my stepfather see that he must adapt himself to the new condition obtain an advance from a relative which enable him to take a medical degree and go out to calcutta where by his professional skill and his force of character he establish a large practice
in a fit of anger however cause by some robberies which have be perpetrate in the house he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escape a capital sentence
as it be he suffer a long term of imprisonment and afterwards return to england a morose and disappoint man
when dr
roylott be in india he marry my mother mrs
stoner the young widow of major general stoner of the bengal artillery
my sister julia and i be twin and we be only two years old at the time of my mother's re marriage
she have a considerable sum of money not less than pound a year and this she bequeath to dr
roylott entirely while we reside with him with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allow to each of us in the event of our marriage
shortly after our return to england my mother die she be kill eight years ago in a railway accident near crewe
dr
roylott then abandon his attempt to establish himself in practice in london and take us to live with him in the old ancestral house at stoke moran
the money which my mother have leave be enough for all our want and there seem to be no obstacle to our happiness
but a terrible change come over our stepfather about this time
instead of make friends and exchange visit with our neighbour who have at first be overjoy to see a roylott of stoke moran back in the old family seat he shut himself up in his house and seldom come out save to indulge in ferocious quarrel with whoever might cross his path
violence of temper approach to mania have be hereditary in the men of the family and in my stepfather's case it have i believe be intensify by his long residence in the tropics
a series of disgraceful brawl take place two of which end in the police court until at last he become the terror of the village and the folks would fly at his approach for he be a man of immense strength and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger
last week he hurl the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream and it be only by pay over all the money which i could gather together that i be able to avert another public exposure
he have no friends at all save the wander gipsies and he would give these vagabond leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble cover land which represent the family estate and would accept in return the hospitality of their tent wander away with them sometimes for weeks on end
he have a passion also for indian animals which be send over to him by a correspondent and he have at this moment a cheetah and a baboon which wander freely over his ground and be fear by the villagers almost as much as their master
you can imagine from what i say that my poor sister julia and i have no great pleasure in our live
no servant would stay with us and for a long time we do all the work of the house
she be but thirty at the time of her death and yet her hair have already begin to whiten even as mine have
your sister be dead then
she die just two years ago and it be of her death that i wish to speak to you
you can understand that live the life which i have describe we be little likely to see anyone of our own age and position
we have however an aunt my mother's maiden sister miss honoria westphail who live near harrow and we be occasionally allow to pay short visit at this lady's house
julia go there at christmas two years ago and meet there a half pay major of marines to whom she become engage
my stepfather learn of the engagement when my sister return and offer no objection to the marriage but within a fortnight of the day which have be fix for the wed the terrible event occur which have deprive me of my only companion
sherlock holmes have be lean back in his chair with his eye close and his head sink in a cushion but he half open his lids now and glance across at his visitor
pray be precise as to detail say he
it be easy for me to be so for every event of that dreadful time be sear into my memory
the manor house be as i have already say very old and only one wing be now inhabit
the bedrooms in this wing be on the grind floor the sit room be in the central block of the build
of these bedrooms the first be dr
roylott's the second my sister's and the third my own
there be no communication between them but they all open out into the same corridor
do i make myself plain
perfectly so
the windows of the three room open out upon the lawn
that fatal night dr
roylott have go to his room early though we know that he have not retire to rest for my sister be trouble by the smell of the strong indian cigars which it be his custom to smoke
she leave her room therefore and come into mine where she sit for some time chat about her approach wed
at eleven o'clock she rise to leave me but she pause at the door and look back
'tell me helen ' say she 'have you ever hear anyone whistle in the dead of the night '
'never ' say i
'i suppose that you could not possibly whistle yourself in your sleep '
'certainly not
but why '
'because during the last few nights i have always about three in the morning hear a low clear whistle
i be a light sleeper and it have awaken me
i cannot tell where it come from perhaps from the next room perhaps from the lawn
i think that i would just ask you whether you have hear it '
'no i have not
it must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation '
'very likely
and yet if it be on the lawn i wonder that you do not hear it also '
'ah but i sleep more heavily than you '
'well it be of no great consequence at any rate '
she smile back at me close my door and a few moments later i hear her key turn in the lock
indeed say holmes
be it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night
always
and why
i think that i mention to you that the doctor keep a cheetah and a baboon
we have no feel of security unless our doors be lock
quite so
pray proceed with your statement
i could not sleep that night
a vague feel of impend misfortune impress me
my sister and i you will recollect be twin and you know how subtle be the link which bind two souls which be so closely ally
it be a wild night
the wind be howl outside and the rain be beat and splash against the windows
suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale there burst forth the wild scream of a terrify woman
i know that it be my sister's voice
i spring from my bed wrap a shawl round me and rush into the corridor
as i open my door i seem to hear a low whistle such as my sister describe and a few moments later a clang sound as if a mass of metal have fall
as i run down the passage my sister's door be unlock and revolve slowly upon its hinge
i star at it horror stricken not know what be about to issue from it
by the light of the corridor lamp i saw my sister appear at the open her face blanch with terror her hand grope for help her whole figure sway to and fro like that of a drunkard
i run to her and throw my arm round her but at that moment her knees seem to give way and she fell to the grind
she writhe as one who be in terrible pain and her limbs be dreadfully convulse
at first i think that she have not recognise me but as i bend over her she suddenly shriek out in a voice which i shall never forget 'oh my god
helen
it be the band
the speckle band '
there be something else which she would fain have say and she stab with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor's room but a fresh convulsion seize her and choke her word
i rush out call loudly for my stepfather and i meet him hasten from his room in his dress gown
when he reach my sister's side she be unconscious and though he pour brandy down her throat and send for medical aid from the village all efforts be in vain for she slowly sink and die without have recover her consciousness
such be the dreadful end of my beloved sister
one moment say holmes be you sure about this whistle and metallic sound
could you swear to it
that be what the county coroner ask me at the inquiry
it be my strong impression that i hear it and yet among the crash of the gale and the creak of an old house i may possibly have be deceive
be your sister dress
no she be in her night dress
in her right hand be find the char stump of a match and in her leave a match box
show that she have strike a light and look about her when the alarm take place
that be important
and what conclusions do the coroner come to
he investigate the case with great care for dr
roylott's conduct have long be notorious in the county but he be unable to find any satisfactory cause of death
my evidence show that the door have be fasten upon the inner side and the windows be block by old fashion shutter with broad iron bar which be secure every night
the wall be carefully sound and be show to be quite solid all round and the floor be also thoroughly examine with the same result
the chimney be wide but be bar up by four large staple
it be certain therefore that my sister be quite alone when she meet her end
besides there be no mark of any violence upon her
how about poison
the doctor examine her for it but without success
what do you think that this unfortunate lady die of then
it be my belief that she die of pure fear and nervous shock though what it be that frighten her i cannot imagine
be there gipsies in the plantation at the time
yes there be nearly always some there
ah and what do you gather from this allusion to a band a speckle band
sometimes i have think that it be merely the wild talk of delirium sometimes that it may have refer to some band of people perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation
i do not know whether the spot handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their head might have suggest the strange adjective which she use
holmes shake his head like a man who be far from be satisfy
these be very deep water say he pray go on with your narrative
two years have pass since then and my life have be until lately lonelier than ever
a month ago however a dear friend whom i have know for many years have do me the honour to ask my hand in marriage
his name be armitage percy armitage the second son of mr
armitage of crane water near read
my stepfather have offer no opposition to the match and we be to be marry in the course of the spring
two days ago some repair be start in the west wing of the build and my bedroom wall have be pierce so that i have have to move into the chamber in which my sister die and to sleep in the very bed in which she sleep
imagine then my thrill of terror when last night as i lay awake think over her terrible fate i suddenly hear in the silence of the night the low whistle which have be the herald of her own death
i spring up and light the lamp but nothing be to be see in the room
i be too shake to go to bed again however so i dress and as soon as it be daylight i slip down get a dog cart at the crown inn which be opposite and drive to leatherhead from whence i have come on this morning with the one object of see you and ask your advice
you have do wisely say my friend
but have you tell me all
yes all
miss roylott you have not
you be screen your stepfather
why what do you mean
for answer holmes push back the frill of black lace which fringe the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee
five little livid spot the mark of four finger and a thumb be print upon the white wrist
you have be cruelly use say holmes
the lady colour deeply and cover over her injure wrist
he be a hard man she say and perhaps he hardly know his own strength
there be a long silence during which holmes lean his chin upon his hand and star into the crackle fire
this be a very deep business he say at last
there be a thousand detail which i should desire to know before i decide upon our course of action
yet we have not a moment to lose
if we be to come to stoke moran to day would it be possible for us to see over these room without the knowledge of your stepfather
as it happen he speak of come into town to day upon some most important business
it be probable that he will be away all day and that there would be nothing to disturb you
we have a housekeeper now but she be old and foolish and i could easily get her out of the way
excellent
you be not averse to this trip watson
by no mean
then we shall both come
what be you go to do yourself
i have one or two things which i would wish to do now that i be in town
but i shall return by the twelve o'clock train so as to be there in time for your come
and you may expect us early in the afternoon
i have myself some small business matter to attend to
will you not wait and breakfast
no i must go
my heart be lighten already since i have confide my trouble to you
i shall look forward to see you again this afternoon
she drop her thick black veil over her face and glide from the room
and what do you think of it all watson
ask sherlock holmes lean back in his chair
it seem to me to be a most dark and sinister business
dark enough and sinister enough
yet if the lady be correct in say that the floor and wall be sound and that the door window and chimney be impassable then her sister must have be undoubtedly alone when she meet her mysterious end
what become then of these nocturnal whistle and what of the very peculiar word of the die woman
i cannot think
when you combine the ideas of whistle at night the presence of a band of gipsies who be on intimate term with this old doctor the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor have an interest in prevent his stepdaughter's marriage the die allusion to a band and finally the fact that miss helen stoner hear a metallic clang which might have be cause by one of those metal bar that secure the shutter fall back into its place i think that there be good grind to think that the mystery may be clear along those line
but what then do the gipsies do
i cannot imagine
i see many objections to any such theory
and so do i it be precisely for that reason that we be go to stoke moran this day
i want to see whether the objections be fatal or if they may be explain away
but what in the name of the devil
the ejaculation have be draw from my companion by the fact that our door have be suddenly dash open and that a huge man have frame himself in the aperture
his costume be a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural have a black top hat a long frock coat and a pair of high gaiters with a hunt crop swing in his hand
so tall be he that his hat actually brush the cross bar of the doorway and his breadth seem to span it across from side to side
a large face sear with a thousand wrinkle burn yellow with the sun and mark with every evil passion be turn from one to the other of us while his deep set bile shoot eye and his high thin fleshless nose give him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey
which of you be holmes
ask this apparition
my name sir but you have the advantage of me say my companion quietly
i be dr
grimesby roylott of stoke moran
indeed doctor say holmes blandly
pray take a seat
i will do nothing of the kind
my stepdaughter have be here
i have trace her
what have she be say to you
it be a little cold for the time of the year say holmes
what have she be say to you
scream the old man furiously
but i have hear that the crocuses promise well continue my companion imperturbably
ha
you put me off do you
say our new visitor take a step forward and shake his hunt crop
i know you you scoundrel
i have hear of you before
you be holmes the meddler
my friend smile
holmes the busybody
his smile broaden
holmes the scotland yard jack in office
holmes chuckle heartily
your conversation be most entertain say he
when you go out close the door for there be a decide draught
i will go when i have say my say
don't you dare to meddle with my affairs
i know that miss stoner have be here
i trace her
i be a dangerous man to fall foul of
see here
he step swiftly forward seize the poker and bend it into a curve with his huge brown hand
see that you keep yourself out of my grip he snarl and hurl the twist poker into the fireplace he stride out of the room
he seem a very amiable person say holmes laugh
i be not quite so bulky but if he have remain i might have show him that my grip be not much more feeble than his own
as he speak he pick up the steel poker and with a sudden effort straighten it out again
fancy his have the insolence to confound me with the official detective force
this incident give zest to our investigation however and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allow this brute to trace her
and now watson we shall order breakfast and afterwards i shall walk down to doctors' commons where i hope to get some data which may help us in this matter
it be nearly one o'clock when sherlock holmes return from his excursion
he hold in his hand a sheet of blue paper scrawl over with note and figure
i have see the will of the decease wife say he
to determine its exact mean i have be oblige to work out the present price of the investments with which it be concern
the total income which at the time of the wife's death be little short of pound be now through the fall in agricultural price not more than pound
each daughter can claim an income of pound in case of marriage
it be evident therefore that if both girls have marry this beauty would have have a mere pittance while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent
my morning's work have not be waste since it have prove that he have the very strongest motives for stand in the way of anything of the sort
and now watson this be too serious for dawdle especially as the old man be aware that we be interest ourselves in his affairs so if you be ready we shall call a cab and drive to waterloo
i should be very much oblige if you would slip your revolver into your pocket
an eley's no
be an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knot
that and a tooth brush be i think all that we need
at waterloo we be fortunate in catch a train for leatherhead where we hire a trap at the station inn and drive for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes
it be a perfect day with a bright sun and a few fleecy cloud in the heavens
the tree and wayside hedge be just throw out their first green shoot and the air be full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth
to me at least there be a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we be engage
my companion sit in the front of the trap his arm fold his hat pull down over his eye and his chin sink upon his breast bury in the deepest think
suddenly however he start tap me on the shoulder and point over the meadows
look there
say he
a heavily timbered park stretch up in a gentle slope thicken into a grove at the highest point
from amid the branch there jut out the grey gables and high roof tree of a very old mansion
stoke moran
say he
yes sir that be the house of dr
grimesby roylott remark the driver
there be some build go on there say holmes that be where we be go
there's the village say the driver point to a cluster of roof some distance to the leave but if you want to get to the house you'll find it shorter to get over this stile and so by the foot path over the field
there it be where the lady be walk
and the lady i fancy be miss stoner observe holmes shade his eye
yes i think we have better do as you suggest
we get off pay our fare and the trap rattle back on its way to leatherhead
i think it as well say holmes as we climb the stile that this fellow should think we have come here as architects or on some definite business
it may stop his gossip
good afternoon miss stoner
you see that we have be as good as our word
our client of the morning have hurry forward to meet us with a face which speak her joy
i have be wait so eagerly for you she cry shake hand with us warmly
all have turn out splendidly
dr
roylott have go to town and it be unlikely that he will be back before even
we have have the pleasure of make the doctor's acquaintance say holmes and in a few word he sketch out what have occur
miss stoner turn white to the lips as she listen
good heavens
she cry he have follow me then
so it appear
he be so cunning that i never know when i be safe from him
what will he say when he return
he must guard himself for he may find that there be someone more cunning than himself upon his track
you must lock yourself up from him to night
if he be violent we shall take you away to your aunt's at harrow
now we must make the best use of our time so kindly take us at once to the room which we be to examine
the build be of grey lichen blotch stone with a high central portion and two curve wing like the claw of a crab throw out on each side
in one of these wing the windows be break and block with wooden board while the roof be partly cave in a picture of ruin
the central portion be in little better repair but the right hand block be comparatively modern and the blind in the windows with the blue smoke curl up from the chimneys show that this be where the family reside
some scaffold have be erect against the end wall and the stone work have be break into but there be no sign of any workmen at the moment of our visit
holmes walk slowly up and down the ill trim lawn and examine with deep attention the outsides of the windows
this i take it belong to the room in which you use to sleep the centre one to your sister's and the one next to the main build to dr
roylott's chamber
exactly so
but i be now sleep in the middle one
pending the alterations as i understand
by the way there do not seem to be any very press need for repair at that end wall
there be none
i believe that it be an excuse to move me from my room
ah
that be suggestive
now on the other side of this narrow wing run the corridor from which these three room open
there be windows in it of course
yes but very small ones
too narrow for anyone to pass through
as you both lock your doors at night your room be unapproachable from that side
now would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutter
miss stoner do so and holmes after a careful examination through the open window endeavour in every way to force the shutter open but without success
there be no slit through which a knife could be pass to raise the bar
then with his lens he test the hinge but they be of solid iron build firmly into the massive masonry
hum
say he scratch his chin in some perplexity my theory certainly present some difficulties
no one could pass these shutter if they be bolt
well we shall see if the inside throw any light upon the matter
a small side door lead into the whitewash corridor from which the three bedrooms open
holmes refuse to examine the third chamber so we pass at once to the second that in which miss stoner be now sleep and in which her sister have meet with her fate
it be a homely little room with a low ceiling and a gap fireplace after the fashion of old country house
a brown chest of drawers stand in one corner a narrow white counterpaned bed in another and a dress table on the leave hand side of the window
these article with two small wicker work chair make up all the furniture in the room save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre
the board round and the panel of the wall be of brown worm eat oak so old and discolour that it may have date from the original build of the house
holmes draw one of the chair into a corner and sit silent while his eye travel round and round and up and down take in every detail of the apartment
where do that bell communicate with
he ask at last point to a thick bell rope which hang down beside the bed the tassel actually lie upon the pillow
it go to the housekeeper's room
it look newer than the other things
yes it be only put there a couple of years ago
your sister ask for it i suppose
no i never hear of her use it
we use always to get what we want for ourselves
indeed it seem unnecessary to put so nice a bell pull there
you will excuse me for a few minutes while i satisfy myself as to this floor
he throw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawl swiftly backward and forward examine minutely the crack between the board
then he do the same with the wood work with which the chamber be panel
finally he walk over to the bed and spend some time in star at it and in run his eye up and down the wall
finally he take the bell rope in his hand and give it a brisk tug
why it's a dummy say he
won't it ring
no it be not even attach to a wire
this be very interest
you can see now that it be fasten to a hook just above where the little open for the ventilator be
how very absurd
i never notice that before
very strange
mutter holmes pull at the rope
there be one or two very singular point about this room
for example what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room when with the same trouble he might have communicate with the outside air
that be also quite modern say the lady
do about the same time as the bell rope
remark holmes
yes there be several little change carry out about that time
they seem to have be of a most interest character dummy bell rope and ventilators which do not ventilate
with your permission miss stoner we shall now carry our research into the inner apartment
dr
grimesby roylott's chamber be larger than that of his step daughter but be as plainly furnish
a camp bed a small wooden shelf full of book mostly of a technical character an armchair beside the bed a plain wooden chair against the wall a round table and a large iron safe be the principal things which meet the eye
holmes walk slowly round and examine each and all of them with the keenest interest
what's in here
he ask tap the safe
my stepfather's business paper
oh
you have see inside then
only once some years ago
i remember that it be full of paper
there isn't a cat in it for example
no
what a strange idea
well look at this
he take up a small saucer of milk which stand on the top of it
no we don't keep a cat
but there be a cheetah and a baboon
ah yes of course
well a cheetah be just a big cat and yet a saucer of milk do not go very far in satisfy its want i daresay
there be one point which i should wish to determine
he squat down in front of the wooden chair and examine the seat of it with the greatest attention
thank you
that be quite settle say he rise and put his lens in his pocket
hullo
here be something interest
the object which have catch his eye be a small dog lash hang on one corner of the bed
the lash however be curl upon itself and tie so as to make a loop of whipcord
what do you make of that watson
it's a common enough lash
but i don't know why it should be tie
that be not quite so common be it
ah me
it's a wicked world and when a clever man turn his brain to crime it be the worst of all
i think that i have see enough now miss stoner and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn
i have never see my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as it be when we turn from the scene of this investigation
we have walk several time up and down the lawn neither miss stoner nor myself like to break in upon his thoughts before he rouse himself from his reverie
it be very essential miss stoner say he that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect
i shall most certainly do so
the matter be too serious for any hesitation
your life may depend upon your compliance
i assure you that i be in your hand
in the first place both my friend and i must spend the night in your room
both miss stoner and i gaze at him in astonishment
yes it must be so
let me explain
i believe that that be the village inn over there
yes that be the crown
very good
your windows would be visible from there
certainly
you must confine yourself to your room on pretence of a headache when your stepfather come back
then when you hear him retire for the night you must open the shutter of your window undo the hasp put your lamp there as a signal to us and then withdraw quietly with everything which you be likely to want into the room which you use to occupy
i have no doubt that in spite of the repair you could manage there for one night
oh yes easily
the rest you will leave in our hand
but what will you do
we shall spend the night in your room and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which have disturb you
i believe mr
holmes that you have already make up your mind say miss stoner lay her hand upon my companion's sleeve
perhaps i have
then for pity's sake tell me what be the cause of my sister's death
i should prefer to have clearer proof before i speak
you can at least tell me whether my own think be correct and if she die from some sudden fright
no i do not think so
i think that there be probably some more tangible cause
and now miss stoner we must leave you for if dr
roylott return and saw us our journey would be in vain
good bye and be brave for if you will do what i have tell you you may rest assure that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you
sherlock holmes and i have no difficulty in engage a bedroom and sit room at the crown inn
they be on the upper floor and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate and of the inhabit wing of stoke moran manor house
at dusk we saw dr
grimesby roylott drive past his huge form loom up beside the little figure of the lad who drive him
the boy have some slight difficulty in undo the heavy iron gate and we hear the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which he shake his clinch fists at him
the trap drive on and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the tree as the lamp be light in one of the sit room
do you know watson say holmes as we sit together in the gather darkness i have really some scruple as to take you to night
there be a distinct element of danger
can i be of assistance
your presence might be invaluable
then i shall certainly come
it be very kind of you
you speak of danger
you have evidently see more in these room than be visible to me
no but i fancy that i may have deduce a little more
i imagine that you saw all that i do
i saw nothing remarkable save the bell rope and what purpose that could answer i confess be more than i can imagine
you saw the ventilator too
yes but i do not think that it be such a very unusual thing to have a small open between two room
it be so small that a rat could hardly pass through
i know that we should find a ventilator before ever we come to stoke moran
my dear holmes
oh yes i do
you remember in her statement she say that her sister could smell dr
roylott's cigar
now of course that suggest at once that there must be a communication between the two room
it could only be a small one or it would have be remark upon at the coroner's inquiry
i deduce a ventilator
but what harm can there be in that
well there be at least a curious coincidence of date
a ventilator be make a cord be hang and a lady who sleep in the bed die
do not that strike you
i cannot as yet see any connection
do you observe anything very peculiar about that bed
no
it be clamp to the floor
do you ever see a bed fasten like that before
i cannot say that i have
the lady could not move her bed
it must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope or so we may call it since it be clearly never mean for a bell pull
holmes i cry i seem to see dimly what you be hint at
we be only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime
subtle enough and horrible enough
when a doctor do go wrong he be the first of criminals
he have nerve and he have knowledge
palmer and pritchard be among the head of their profession
this man strike even deeper but i think watson that we shall be able to strike deeper still
but we shall have horrors enough before the night be over for goodness' sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our mind for a few hours to something more cheerful
about nine o'clock the light among the tree be extinguish and all be dark in the direction of the manor house
two hours pass slowly away and then suddenly just at the stroke of eleven a single bright light shine out right in front of us
that be our signal say holmes spring to his feet it come from the middle window
as we pass out he exchange a few word with the landlord explain that we be go on a late visit to an acquaintance and that it be possible that we might spend the night there
a moment later we be out on the dark road a chill wind blow in our face and one yellow light twinkle in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand
there be little difficulty in enter the ground for unrepaired breach gap in the old park wall
make our way among the tree we reach the lawn cross it and be about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bush there dart what seem to be a hideous and distort child who throw itself upon the grass with writhe limbs and then run swiftly across the lawn into the darkness
my god
i whisper do you see it
holmes be for the moment as startle as i his hand close like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation
then he break into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear
it be a nice household he murmur
that be the baboon
i have forget the strange pet which the doctor affect
there be a cheetah too perhaps we might find it upon our shoulder at any moment
i confess that i felt easier in my mind when after follow holmes' example and slip off my shoe i find myself inside the bedroom
my companion noiselessly close the shutter move the lamp onto the table and cast his eye round the room
all be as we have see it in the daytime
then creep up to me and make a trumpet of his hand he whisper into my ear again so gently that it be all that i could do to distinguish the word the least sound would be fatal to our plan
i nod to show that i have hear
we must sit without light
he would see it through the ventilator
i nod again
do not go asleep your very life may depend upon it
have your pistol ready in case we should need it
i will sit on the side of the bed and you in that chair
i take out my revolver and lay it on the corner of the table
holmes have bring up a long thin cane and this he place upon the bed beside him
by it he lay the box of match and the stump of a candle
then he turn down the lamp and we be leave in darkness
how shall i ever forget that dreadful vigil
i could not hear a sound not even the draw of a breath and yet i know that my companion sit open eye within a few feet of me in the same state of nervous tension in which i be myself
the shutter cut off the least ray of light and we wait in absolute darkness
from outside come the occasional cry of a night bird and once at our very window a long draw catlike whine which tell us that the cheetah be indeed at liberty
far away we could hear the deep tone of the parish clock which boom out every quarter of an hour
how long they seem those quarter
twelve strike and one and two and three and still we sit wait silently for whatever might befall
suddenly there be the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator which vanish immediately but be succeed by a strong smell of burn oil and heat metal
someone in the next room have light a dark lantern
i hear a gentle sound of movement and then all be silent once more though the smell grow stronger
for half an hour i sit with strain ears
then suddenly another sound become audible a very gentle soothe sound like that of a small jet of steam escape continually from a kettle
the instant that we hear it holmes spring from the bed strike a match and lash furiously with his cane at the bell pull
you see it watson
he yell
you see it
but i saw nothing
at the moment when holmes strike the light i hear a low clear whistle but the sudden glare flash into my weary eye make it impossible for me to tell what it be at which my friend lash so savagely
i could however see that his face be deadly pale and fill with horror and loathe
he have cease to strike and be gaze up at the ventilator when suddenly there break from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listen
it swell up louder and louder a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingle in the one dreadful shriek
they say that away down in the village and even in the distant parsonage that cry raise the sleepers from their bed
it strike cold to our hearts and i stand gaze at holmes and he at me until the last echo of it have die away into the silence from which it rise
what can it mean
i gasp
it mean that it be all over holmes answer
and perhaps after all it be for the best
take your pistol and we will enter dr
roylott's room
with a grave face he light the lamp and lead the way down the corridor
twice he strike at the chamber door without any reply from within
then he turn the handle and enter i at his heel with the cock pistol in my hand
it be a singular sight which meet our eye
on the table stand a dark lantern with the shutter half open throw a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe the door of which be ajar
beside this table on the wooden chair sit dr
grimesby roylott clothe in a long grey dress gown his bare ankles protrude beneath and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers
across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we have notice during the day
his chin be cock upward and his eye be fix in a dreadful rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling
round his brow he have a peculiar yellow band with brownish speckle which seem to be bind tightly round his head
as we enter he make neither sound nor motion
the band
the speckle band
whisper holmes
i take a step forward
in an instant his strange headgear begin to move and there rear itself from among his hair the squat diamond shape head and puff neck of a loathsome serpent
it be a swamp adder
cry holmes the deadliest snake in india
he have die within ten second of be bite
violence do in truth recoil upon the violent and the schemer fall into the pit which he dig for another
let us thrust this creature back into its den and we can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what have happen
as he speak he draw the dog whip swiftly from the dead man's lap and throw the noose round the reptile's neck he draw it from its horrid perch and carry it at arm's length throw it into the iron safe which he close upon it
such be the true facts of the death of dr
grimesby roylott of stoke moran
it be not necessary that i should prolong a narrative which have already run to too great a length by tell how we break the sad news to the terrify girl how we convey her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at harrow of how the slow process of official inquiry come to the conclusion that the doctor meet his fate while indiscreetly play with a dangerous pet
the little which i have yet to learn of the case be tell me by sherlock holmes as we travel back next day
i have say he come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which show my dear watson how dangerous it always be to reason from insufficient data
the presence of the gipsies and the use of the word 'band ' which be use by the poor girl no doubt to explain the appearance which she have catch a hurry glimpse of by the light of her match be sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent
i can only claim the merit that i instantly reconsider my position when however it become clear to me that whatever danger threaten an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door
my attention be speedily draw as i have already remark to you to this ventilator and to the bell rope which hang down to the bed
the discovery that this be a dummy and that the bed be clamp to the floor instantly give rise to the suspicion that the rope be there as a bridge for something pass through the hole and come to the bed
the idea of a snake instantly occur to me and when i couple it with my knowledge that the doctor be furnish with a supply of creatures from india i felt that i be probably on the right track
the idea of use a form of poison which could not possibly be discover by any chemical test be just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who have have an eastern train
the rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also from his point of view be an advantage
it would be a sharp eye coroner indeed who could distinguish the two little dark puncture which would show where the poison fangs have do their work
then i think of the whistle
of course he must recall the snake before the morning light reveal it to the victim
he have train it probably by the use of the milk which we saw to return to him when summon
he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he think best with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed
it might or might not bite the occupant perhaps she might escape every night for a week but sooner or later she must fall a victim
i have come to these conclusions before ever i have enter his room
an inspection of his chair show me that he have be in the habit of stand on it which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator
the sight of the safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord be enough to finally dispel any doubt which may have remain
the metallic clang hear by miss stoner be obviously cause by her stepfather hastily close the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant
have once make up my mind you know the step which i take in order to put the matter to the proof
i hear the creature hiss as i have no doubt that you do also and i instantly light the light and attack it
with the result of drive it through the ventilator
and also with the result of cause it to turn upon its master at the other side
some of the blow of my cane come home and rouse its snakish temper so that it fly upon the first person it saw
in this way i be no doubt indirectly responsible for dr
grimesby roylott's death and i cannot say that it be likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience
in choose a few typical case which illustrate the remarkable mental qualities of my friend sherlock holmes i have endeavour as far as possible to select those which present the minimum of sensationalism while offer a fair field for his talents
it be however unfortunately impossible entirely to separate the sensational from the criminal and a chronicler be leave in the dilemma that he must either sacrifice detail which be essential to his statement and so give a false impression of the problem or he must use matter which chance and not choice have provide him with
with this short preface i shall turn to my note of what prove to be a strange though a peculiarly terrible chain of events
it be a blaze hot day in august
baker street be like an oven and the glare of the sunlight upon the yellow brickwork of the house across the road be painful to the eye
it be hard to believe that these be the same wall which loom so gloomily through the fog of winter
our blind be half draw and holmes lay curl upon the sofa read and re read a letter which he have receive by the morning post
for myself my term of service in india have train me to stand heat better than cold and a thermometer at ninety be no hardship
but the morning paper be uninteresting
parliament have rise
everybody be out of town and i yearn for the glades of the new forest or the shingle of southsea
a deplete bank account have cause me to postpone my holiday and as to my companion neither the country nor the sea present the slightest attraction to him
he love to lie in the very centre of five millions of people with his filaments stretch out and run through them responsive to every little rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime
appreciation of nature find no place among his many gift and his only change be when he turn his mind from the evil doer of the town to track down his brother of the country
find that holmes be too absorb for conversation i have toss aside the barren paper and lean back in my chair i fell into a brown study
suddenly my companion's voice break in upon my thoughts you be right watson say he
it do seem a most preposterous way of settle a dispute most preposterous i exclaim and then suddenly realize how he have echo the inmost think of my soul i sit up in my chair and star at him in blank amazement
what be this holmes i cry
this be beyond anything which i could have imagine he laugh heartily at my perplexity
you remember he say that some little time ago when i read you the passage in one of poe's sketch in which a close reasoner follow the unspoken thoughts of his companion you be incline to treat the matter as a mere _tour de force_ of the author
on my remark that i be constantly in the habit of do the same thing you express incredulity oh no perhaps not with your tongue my dear watson but certainly with your eyebrows
so when i saw you throw down your paper and enter upon a train of think i be very happy to have the opportunity of read it off and eventually of break into it as a proof that i have be in rapport with you but i be still far from satisfy
in the example which you read to me say i the reasoner draw his conclusions from the action of the man whom he observe
if i remember right he stumble over a heap of stone look up at the star and so on
but i have be seat quietly in my chair and what clue can i have give you you do yourself an injustice
the feature be give to man as the mean by which he shall express his emotions and yours be faithful servants do you mean to say that you read my train of thoughts from my feature your feature and especially your eye
perhaps you cannot yourself recall how your reverie commence no i cannot then i will tell you
after throw down your paper which be the action which draw my attention to you you sit for half a minute with a vacant expression
then your eye fix themselves upon your newly frame picture of general gordon and i saw by the alteration in your face that a train of think have be start
but it do not lead very far
your eye flash across to the unframed portrait of henry ward beecher which stand upon the top of your book
then you glance up at the wall and of course your mean be obvious
you be think that if the portrait be frame it would just cover that bare space and correspond with gordon's picture over there you have follow me wonderfully i exclaim
so far i could hardly have go astray
but now your thoughts go back to beecher and you look hard across as if you be study the character in his feature
then your eye cease to pucker but you continue to look across and your face be thoughtful
you be recall the incidents of beecher's career
i be well aware that you could not do this without think of the mission which he undertake on behalf of the north at the time of the civil war for i remember your express your passionate indignation at the way in which he be receive by the more turbulent of our people
you felt so strongly about it that i know you could not think of beecher without think of that also
when a moment later i saw your eye wander away from the picture i suspect that your mind have now turn to the civil war and when i observe that your lips set your eye sparkle and your hand clench i be positive that you be indeed think of the gallantry which be show by both side in that desperate struggle
but then again your face grow sadder you shake your head
you be dwell upon the sadness and horror and useless waste of life
your hand steal towards your own old wind and a smile quiver on your lips which show me that the ridiculous side of this method of settle international question have force itself upon your mind
at this point i agree with you that it be preposterous and be glad to find that all my deductions have be correct absolutely say i
and now that you have explain it i confess that i be as amaze as before it be very superficial my dear watson i assure you
i should not have intrude it upon your attention have you not show some incredulity the other day
but i have in my hand here a little problem which may prove to be more difficult of solution than my small essay in think read
have you observe in the paper a short paragraph refer to the remarkable content of a packet send through the post to miss cushing of cross street croydon no i saw nothing ah
then you must have overlook it
just toss it over to me
here it be under the financial column
perhaps you would be good enough to read it aloud i pick up the paper which he have throw back to me and read the paragraph indicate
it be head a gruesome packet miss susan cushing live at cross street croydon have be make the victim of what must be regard as a peculiarly revolt practical joke unless some more sinister mean should prove to be attach to the incident
at two o'clock yesterday afternoon a small packet wrap in brown paper be hand in by the postman
a cardboard box be inside which be fill with coarse salt
on empty this miss cushing be horrify to find two human ears apparently quite freshly sever
the box have be send by parcel post from belfast upon the morning before
there be no indication as to the sender and the matter be the more mysterious as miss cushing who be a maiden lady of fifty have lead a most retire life and have so few acquaintances or correspondents that it be a rare event for her to receive anything through the post
some years ago however when she reside at penge she let apartments in her house to three young medical students whom she be oblige to get rid of on account of their noisy and irregular habit
the police be of opinion that this outrage may have be perpetrate upon miss cushing by these youths who owe her a grudge and who hop to frighten her by send her these relics of the dissect room
some probability be lend to the theory by the fact that one of these students come from the north of ireland and to the best of miss cushing's belief from belfast
in the meantime the matter be be actively investigate mr
lestrade one of the very smartest of our detective officer be in charge of the case so much for the _daily chronicle_ say holmes as i finish read
now for our friend lestrade
i have a note from him this morning in which he say 'i think that this case be very much in your line
we have every hope of clear the matter up but we find a little difficulty in get anything to work upon
we have of course wire to the belfast post office but a large number of parcel be hand in upon that day and they have no mean of identify this particular one or of remember the sender
the box be a half pound box of honeydew tobacco and do not help us in any way
the medical student theory still appear to me to be the most feasible but if you should have a few hours to spare i should be very happy to see you out here
i shall be either at the house or in the police station all day ' what say you watson
can you rise superior to the heat and run down to croydon with me on the off chance of a case for your annals i be long for something to do you shall have it then
ring for our boot and tell them to order a cab
i'll be back in a moment when i have change my dress gown and fill my cigar case a shower of rain fell while we be in the train and the heat be far less oppressive in croydon than in town
holmes have send on a wire so that lestrade as wiry as dapper and as ferret like as ever be wait for us at the station
a walk of five minutes take us to cross street where miss cushing reside
it be a very long street of two story brick house neat and prim with whiten stone step and little group of aproned women gossip at the doors
halfway down lestrade stop and tap at a door which be open by a small servant girl
miss cushing be sit in the front room into which we be usher
she be a placid face woman with large gentle eye and grizzle hair curve down over her temples on each side
a work antimacassar lay upon her lap and a basket of colour silks stand upon a stool beside her
they be in the outhouse those dreadful things say she as lestrade enter
i wish that you would take them away altogether so i shall miss cushing
i only keep them here until my friend mr
holmes should have see them in your presence why in my presence sir in case he wish to ask any question what be the use of ask me question when i tell you i know nothing whatever about it quite so madam say holmes in his soothe way
i have no doubt that you have be annoy more than enough already over this business indeed i have sir
i be a quiet woman and live a retire life
it be something new for me to see my name in the paper and to find the police in my house
i won't have those things in here mr
lestrade
if you wish to see them you must go to the outhouse it be a small shed in the narrow garden which run behind the house
lestrade go in and bring out a yellow cardboard box with a piece of brown paper and some string
there be a bench at the end of the path and we all sit down while holmes examine one by one the article which lestrade have hand to him
the string be exceedingly interest he remark hold it up to the light and sniff at it
what do you make of this string lestrade it have be tar precisely
it be a piece of tar twine
you have also no doubt remark that miss cushing have cut the cord with a scissor as can be see by the double fray on each side
this be of importance i cannot see the importance say lestrade
the importance lie in the fact that the knot be leave intact and that this knot be of a peculiar character it be very neatly tie
i have already make a note to that effect say lestrade complacently
so much for the string then say holmes smile now for the box wrapper
brown paper with a distinct smell of coffee
what do you not observe it
i think there can be no doubt of it
address print in rather straggle character 'miss s cushing cross street croydon ' do with a broad point pen probably a j and with very inferior ink
the word 'croydon' have be originally spell with an 'i ' which have be change to 'y ' the parcel be direct then by a man the print be distinctly masculine of limit education and unacquainted with the town of croydon
so far so good
the box be a yellow half pound honeydew box with nothing distinctive save two thumb mark at the leave bottom corner
it be fill with rough salt of the quality use for preserve hide and other of the coarser commercial purpose
and embed in it be these very singular enclosures he take out the two ears as he speak and lay a board across his knee he examine them minutely while lestrade and i bend forward on each side of him glance alternately at these dreadful relics and at the thoughtful eager face of our companion
finally he return them to the box once more and sit for a while in deep meditation
you have observe of course say he at last that the ears be not a pair yes i have notice that
but if this be the practical joke of some students from the dissect room it would be as easy for them to send two odd ears as a pair precisely
but this be not a practical joke you be sure of it the presumption be strongly against it
body in the dissect room be inject with preservative fluid
these ears bear no sign of this
they be fresh too
they have be cut off with a blunt instrument which would hardly happen if a student have do it
again carbolic or rectify spirit would be the preservatives which would suggest themselves to the medical mind certainly not rough salt
i repeat that there be no practical joke here but that we be investigate a serious crime a vague thrill run through me as i listen to my companion's word and saw the stern gravity which have harden his feature
this brutal preliminary seem to shadow forth some strange and inexplicable horror in the background
lestrade however shake his head like a man who be only half convince
there be objections to the joke theory no doubt say he but there be much stronger reason against the other
we know that this woman have lead a most quiet and respectable life at penge and here for the last twenty years
she have hardly be away from her home for a day during that time
why on earth then should any criminal send her the proof of his guilt especially as unless she be a most consummate actress she understand quite as little of the matter as we do that be the problem which we have to solve holmes answer and for my part i shall set about it by presume that my reason be correct and that a double murder have be commit
one of these ears be a woman's small finely form and pierce for an earring
the other be a man's sun burn discolour and also pierce for an earring
these two people be presumably dead or we should have hear their story before now
to day be friday
the packet be post on thursday morning
the tragedy then occur on wednesday or tuesday or earlier
if the two people be murder who but their murderer would have send this sign of his work to miss cushing
we may take it that the sender of the packet be the man whom we want
but he must have some strong reason for send miss cushing this packet
what reason then
it must have be to tell her that the deed be do
or to pain her perhaps
but in that case she know who it be
do she know
i doubt it
if she know why should she call the police in
she might have bury the ears and no one would have be the wiser
that be what she would have do if she have wish to shield the criminal
but if she do not wish to shield him she would give his name
there be a tangle here which need straighten out he have be talk in a high quick voice star blankly up over the garden fence but now he spring briskly to his feet and walk towards the house
i have a few question to ask miss cushing say he
in that case i may leave you here say lestrade for i have another small business on hand
i think that i have nothing further to learn from miss cushing
you will find me at the police station we shall look in on our way to the train answer holmes
a moment later he and i be back in the front room where the impassive lady be still quietly work away at her antimacassar
she put it down on her lap as we enter and look at us with her frank search blue eye
i be convince sir she say that this matter be a mistake and that the parcel be never mean for me at all
i have say this several time to the gentleman from scotland yard but he simply laugh at me
i have not an enemy in the world as far as i know so why should anyone play me such a trick i be come to be of the same opinion miss cushing say holmes take a seat beside her
i think that it be more than probable he pause and i be surprise on glance round to see that he be star with singular intentness at the lady's profile
surprise and satisfaction be both for an instant to be read upon his eager face though when she glance round to find out the cause of his silence he have become as demure as ever
i star hard myself at her flat grizzle hair her trim cap her little gild earrings her placid feature but i could see nothing which could account for my companion's evident excitement
there be one or two question oh i be weary of question cry miss cushing impatiently
you have two sisters i believe how could you know that i observe the very instant that i enter the room that you have a portrait group of three ladies upon the mantelpiece one of whom be undoubtedly yourself while the others be so exceedingly like you that there could be no doubt of the relationship yes you be quite right
those be my sisters sarah and mary and here at my elbow be another portrait take at liverpool of your younger sister in the company of a man who appear to be a steward by his uniform
i observe that she be unmarried at the time you be very quick at observe that be my trade well you be quite right
but she be marry to mr
browner a few days afterwards
he be on the south american line when that be take but he be so fond of her that he couldn't abide to leave her for so long and he get into the liverpool and london boat ah the _conqueror_ perhaps no the _may day_ when last i hear
jim come down here to see me once
that be before he break the pledge but afterwards he would always take drink when he be ashore and a little drink would send him stark star mad
ah
it be a bad day that ever he take a glass in his hand again
first he drop me then he quarrel with sarah and now that mary have stop write we don't know how things be go with them it be evident that miss cushing have come upon a subject on which she felt very deeply
like most people who lead a lonely life she be shy at first but end by become extremely communicative
she tell us many detail about her brother in law the steward and then wander off on the subject of her former lodgers the medical students she give us a long account of their delinquencies with their name and those of their hospitals
holmes listen attentively to everything throw in a question from time to time
about your second sister sarah say he
i wonder since you be both maiden ladies that you do not keep house together ah
you don't know sarah's temper or you would wonder no more
i try it when i come to croydon and we keep on until about two months ago when we have to part
i don't want to say a word against my own sister but she be always meddlesome and hard to please be sarah you say that she quarrel with your liverpool relations yes and they be the best of friends at one time
why she go up there to live in order to be near them
and now she have no word hard enough for jim browner
the last six months that she be here she would speak of nothing but his drink and his ways
he have catch her meddle i suspect and give her a bite of his mind and that be the start of it thank you miss cushing say holmes rise and bow
your sister sarah live i think you say at new street wallington
good bye and i be very sorry that you should have be trouble over a case with which as you say you have nothing whatever to do there be a cab pass as we come out and holmes hail it
how far to wallington he ask
only about a mile sir very good
jump in watson
we must strike while the iron be hot
simple as the case be there have be one or two very instructive detail in connection with it
just pull up at a telegraph office as you pass cabby holmes send off a short wire and for the rest of the drive lay back in the cab with his hat tilt over his nose to keep the sun from his face
our driver pull up at a house which be not unlike the one which we have just quit
my companion order him to wait and have his hand upon the knocker when the door open and a grave young gentleman in black with a very shiny hat appear on the step
be miss cushing at home ask holmes
miss sarah cushing be extremely ill say he
she have be suffer since yesterday from brain symptoms of great severity
as her medical adviser i cannot possibly take the responsibility of allow anyone to see her
i should recommend you to call again in ten days he draw on his gloves close the door and march off down the street
well if we can't we can't say holmes cheerfully
perhaps she could not or would not have tell you much i do not wish her to tell me anything
i only want to look at her
however i think that i have get all that i want
drive us to some decent hotel cabby where we may have some lunch and afterwards we shall drop down upon friend lestrade at the police station we have a pleasant little meal together during which holmes would talk about nothing but violins narrate with great exultation how he have purchase his own stradivarius which be worth at least five hundred guineas at a jew broker's in tottenham court road for fifty five shill
this lead him to paganini and we sit for an hour over a bottle of claret while he tell me anecdote after anecdote of that extraordinary man
the afternoon be far advance and the hot glare have soften into a mellow glow before we find ourselves at the police station
lestrade be wait for us at the door
a telegram for you mr
holmes say he
ha
it be the answer he tear it open glance his eye over it and crumple it into his pocket
that's all right say he
have you find out anything i have find out everything what lestrade star at him in amazement
you be joke i be never more serious in my life
a shock crime have be commit and i think i have now lay bare every detail of it and the criminal holmes scribble a few word upon the back of one of his visit card and throw it over to lestrade
that be the name he say
you cannot effect an arrest until to morrow night at the earliest
i should prefer that you do not mention my name at all in connection with the case as i choose to be only associate with those crimes which present some difficulty in their solution
come on watson we stride off together to the station leave lestrade still star with a delight face at the card which holmes have throw him
the case say sherlock holmes as we chat over our cigars that night in our room at baker street be one where as in the investigations which you have chronicle under the name of 'a study in scarlet' and of 'the sign of four ' we have be compel to reason backward from effect to cause
i have write to lestrade ask him to supply us with the detail which be now want and which he will only get after he have secure his man
that he may be safely trust to do for although he be absolutely devoid of reason he be as tenacious as a bulldog when he once understand what he have to do and indeed it be just this tenacity which have bring him to the top at scotland yard your case be not complete then i ask
it be fairly complete in essentials
we know who the author of the revolt business be although one of the victims still escape us
of course you have form your own conclusions i presume that this jim browner the steward of a liverpool boat be the man whom you suspect oh
it be more than a suspicion and yet i cannot see anything save very vague indications on the contrary to my mind nothing could be more clear
let me run over the principal step
we approach the case you remember with an absolutely blank mind which be always an advantage
we have form no theories
we be simply there to observe and to draw inferences from our observations
what do we see first
a very placid and respectable lady who seem quite innocent of any secret and a portrait which show me that she have two younger sisters
it instantly flash across my mind that the box might have be mean for one of these
i set the idea aside as one which could be disprove or confirm at our leisure
then we go to the garden as you remember and we saw the very singular content of the little yellow box
the string be of the quality which be use by sailmakers aboard ship and at once a whiff of the sea be perceptible in our investigation
when i observe that the knot be one which be popular with sailors that the parcel have be post at a port and that the male ear be pierce for an earring which be so much more common among sailors than landsmen i be quite certain that all the actors in the tragedy be to be find among our seafaring class
when i come to examine the address of the packet i observe that it be to miss s cushing
now the oldest sister would of course be miss cushing and although her initial be 's' it might belong to one of the others as well
in that case we should have to commence our investigation from a fresh basis altogether
i therefore go into the house with the intention of clear up this point
i be about to assure miss cushing that i be convince that a mistake have be make when you may remember that i come suddenly to a stop
the fact be that i have just see something which fill me with surprise and at the same time narrow the field of our inquiry immensely
as a medical man you be aware watson that there be no part of the body which vary so much as the human ear
each ear be as a rule quite distinctive and differ from all other ones
in last year's _anthropological journal_ you will find two short monographs from my pen upon the subject
i have therefore examine the ears in the box with the eye of an expert and have carefully note their anatomical peculiarities
imagine my surprise then when on look at miss cushing i perceive that her ear correspond exactly with the female ear which i have just inspect
the matter be entirely beyond coincidence
there be the same shorten of the pinna the same broad curve of the upper lobe the same convolution of the inner cartilage
in all essentials it be the same ear
of course i at once saw the enormous importance of the observation
it be evident that the victim be a blood relation and probably a very close one
i begin to talk to her about her family and you remember that she at once give us some exceedingly valuable detail
in the first place her sister's name be sarah and her address have until recently be the same so that it be quite obvious how the mistake have occur and for whom the packet be mean
then we hear of this steward marry to the third sister and learn that he have at one time be so intimate with miss sarah that she have actually go up to liverpool to be near the browners but a quarrel have afterwards divide them
this quarrel have put a stop to all communications for some months so that if browner have occasion to address a packet to miss sarah he would undoubtedly have do so to her old address
and now the matter have begin to straighten itself out wonderfully
we have learn of the existence of this steward an impulsive man of strong passions you remember that he throw up what must have be a very superior berth in order to be nearer to his wife subject too to occasional fit of hard drink
we have reason to believe that his wife have be murder and that a man presumably a seafaring man have be murder at the same time
jealousy of course at once suggest itself as the motive for the crime
and why should these proof of the deed be send to miss sarah cushing
probably because during her residence in liverpool she have some hand in bring about the events which lead to the tragedy
you will observe that this line of boat call at belfast dublin and waterford so that presume that browner have commit the deed and have embark at once upon his steamer the _may day_ belfast would be the first place at which he could post his terrible packet
a second solution be at this stage obviously possible and although i think it exceedingly unlikely i be determine to elucidate it before go further
an unsuccessful lover might have kill mr
and mrs
browner and the male ear might have belong to the husband
there be many grave objections to this theory but it be conceivable
i therefore send off a telegram to my friend algar of the liverpool force and ask him to find out if mrs
browner be at home and if browner have depart in the _may day_
then we go on to wallington to visit miss sarah
i be curious in the first place to see how far the family ear have be reproduce in her
then of course she might give us very important information but i be not sanguine that she would
she must have hear of the business the day before since all croydon be ring with it and she alone could have understand for whom the packet be mean
if she have be will to help justice she would probably have communicate with the police already
however it be clearly our duty to see her so we go
we find that the news of the arrival of the packet for her illness date from that time have such an effect upon her as to bring on brain fever
it be clearer than ever that she understand its full significance but equally clear that we should have to wait some time for any assistance from her
however we be really independent of her help
our answer be wait for us at the police station where i have direct algar to send them
nothing could be more conclusive
mrs
browner's house have be close for more than three days and the neighbour be of opinion that she have go south to see her relatives
it have be ascertain at the ship offices that browner have leave aboard of the _may day_ and i calculate that she be due in the thames to morrow night
when he arrive he will be meet by the obtuse but resolute lestrade and i have no doubt that we shall have all our detail fill in sherlock holmes be not disappoint in his expectations
two days later he receive a bulky envelope which contain a short note from the detective and a typewrite document which cover several page of foolscap
lestrade have get him all right say holmes glance up at me
perhaps it would interest you to hear what he say
my dear mr
holmes in accordance with the scheme which we have form in order to test our theories the 'we' be rather fine watson be it not i go down to the albert dock yesterday at p m and board the s s
_may day_ belong to the liverpool dublin and london steam packet company
on inquiry i find that there be a steward on board of the name of jam browner and that he have act during the voyage in such an extraordinary manner that the captain have be compel to relieve him of his duties
on descend to his berth i find him seat upon a chest with his head sink upon his hand rock himself to and fro
he be a big powerful chap clean shave and very swarthy something like aldridge who help us in the bogus laundry affair
he jump up when he hear my business and i have my whistle to my lips to call a couple of river police who be round the corner but he seem to have no heart in him and he hold out his hand quietly enough for the darbies
we bring him along to the cells and his box as well for we think there might be something incriminate but bar a big sharp knife such as most sailors have we get nothing for our trouble
however we find that we shall want no more evidence for on be bring before the inspector at the station he ask leave to make a statement which be of course take down just as he make it by our shorthand man
we have three copy typewrite one of which i enclose
the affair prove as i always think it would to be an extremely simple one but i be oblige to you for assist me in my investigation
with kind regard yours very truly g
lestrade hum
the investigation really be a very simple one remark holmes but i don't think it strike him in that light when he first call us in
however let us see what jim browner have to say for himself
this be his statement as make before inspector montgomery at the shadwell police station and it have the advantage of be verbatim have i anything to say
yes i have a deal to say
i have to make a clean breast of it all
you can hang me or you can leave me alone
i don't care a plug which you do
i tell you i've not shut an eye in sleep since i do it and i don't believe i ever will again until i get past all wake
sometimes it's his face but most generally it's hers
i'm never without one or the other before me
he look frown and black like but she have a kind o' surprise upon her face
ay the white lamb she might well be surprise when she read death on a face that have seldom look anything but love upon her before
but it be sarah's fault and may the curse of a break man put a blight on her and set the blood rot in her vein
it's not that i want to clear myself
i know that i go back to drink like the beast that i be
but she would have forgive me she would have stick as close to me as a rope to a block if that woman have never darken our door
for sarah cushing love me that's the root of the business she love me until all her love turn to poisonous hate when she know that i think more of my wife's footmark in the mud than i do of her whole body and soul
there be three sisters altogether
the old one be just a good woman the second be a devil and the third be an angel
sarah be thirty three and mary be twenty nine when i marry
we be just as happy as the day be long when we set up house together and in all liverpool there be no better woman than my mary
and then we ask sarah up for a week and the week grow into a month and one thing lead to another until she be just one of ourselves
i be blue ribbon at that time and we be put a little money by and all be as bright as a new dollar
my god whoever would have think that it could have come to this
whoever would have dream it
i use to be home for the week end very often and sometimes if the ship be hold back for cargo i would have a whole week at a time and in this way i saw a deal of my sister in law sarah
she be a fine tall woman black and quick and fierce with a proud way of carry her head and a glint from her eye like a spark from a flint
but when little mary be there i have never a think of her and that i swear as i hope for god's mercy
it have seem to me sometimes that she like to be alone with me or to coax me out for a walk with her but i have never think anything of that
but one even my eye be open
i have come up from the ship and find my wife out but sarah at home
'where's mary ' i ask
'oh she have go to pay some account ' i be impatient and pace up and down the room
'can't you be happy for five minutes without mary jim ' say she
'it's a bad compliment to me that you can't be content with my society for so short a time ' 'that's all right my lass ' say i put out my hand towards her in a kindly way but she have it in both hers in an instant and they burn as if they be in a fever
i look into her eye and i read it all there
there be no need for her to speak nor for me either
i frown and draw my hand away
then she stand by my side in silence for a bite and then put up her hand and pat me on the shoulder
'steady old jim ' say she and with a kind o' mock laugh she run out of the room
well from that time sarah hat me with her whole heart and soul and she be a woman who can hate too
i be a fool to let her go on bid with us a besotted fool but i never say a word to mary for i know it would grieve her
things go on much as before but after a time i begin to find that there be a bite of a change in mary herself
she have always be so trust and so innocent but now she become queer and suspicious want to know where i have be and what i have be do and whom my letter be from and what i have in my pocket and a thousand such follies
day by day she grow queerer and more irritable and we have ceaseless row about nothing
i be fairly puzzle by it all
sarah avoid me now but she and mary be just inseparable
i can see now how she be plot and scheme and poison my wife's mind against me but i be such a blind beetle that i could not understand it at the time
then i break my blue ribbon and begin to drink again but i think i should not have do it if mary have be the same as ever
she have some reason to be disgust with me now and the gap between us begin to be wider and wider
and then this alec fairbairn chip in and things become a thousand time blacker
it be to see sarah that he come to my house first but soon it be to see us for he be a man with win ways and he make friends wherever he go
he be a dash swagger chap smart and curl who have see half the world and could talk of what he have see
he be good company i won't deny it and he have wonderful polite ways with him for a sailor man so that i think there must have be a time when he know more of the poop than the forecastle
for a month he be in and out of my house and never once do it cross my mind that harm might come of his soft tricky ways
and then at last something make me suspect and from that day my peace be go forever
it be only a little thing too
i have come into the parlour unexpected and as i walk in at the door i saw a light of welcome on my wife's face
but as she saw who it be it fade again and she turn away with a look of disappointment
that be enough for me
there be no one but alec fairbairn whose step she could have mistake for mine
if i could have see him then i should have kill him for i have always be like a madman when my temper get loose
mary saw the devil's light in my eye and she run forward with her hand on my sleeve
'don't jim don't ' say she
'where's sarah ' i ask
'in the kitchen ' say she
'sarah ' say i as i go in 'this man fairbairn be never to darken my door again ' 'why not ' say she
'because i order it ' 'oh ' say she 'if my friends be not good enough for this house then i be not good enough for it either ' 'you can do what you like ' say i 'but if fairbairn show his face here again i'll send you one of his ears for a keepsake ' she be frighten by my face i think for she never answer a word and the same even she leave my house
well i don't know now whether it be pure devilry on the part of this woman or whether she think that she could turn me against my wife by encourage her to misbehave
anyway she take a house just two streets off and let lodge to sailors
fairbairn use to stay there and mary would go round to have tea with her sister and him
how often she go i don't know but i follow her one day and as i break in at the door fairbairn get away over the back garden wall like the cowardly skunk that he be
i swear to my wife that i would kill her if i find her in his company again and i lead her back with me sob and tremble and as white as a piece of paper
there be no trace of love between us any longer
i could see that she hat me and fear me and when the think of it drive me to drink then she despise me as well
well sarah find that she could not make a live in liverpool so she go back as i understand to live with her sister in croydon and things jog on much the same as ever at home
and then come this last week and all the misery and ruin
it be in this way
we have go on the _may day_ for a round voyage of seven days but a hogshead get loose and start one of our plat so that we have to put back into port for twelve hours
i leave the ship and come home think what a surprise it would be for my wife and hop that maybe she would be glad to see me so soon
the think be in my head as i turn into my own street and at that moment a cab pass me and there she be sit by the side of fairbairn the two chat and laugh with never a think for me as i stand watch them from the footpath
i tell you and i give you my word for it that from that moment i be not my own master and it be all like a dim dream when i look back on it
i have be drink hard of late and the two things together fairly turn my brain
there's something throb in my head now like a docker's hammer but that morning i seem to have all niagara whiz and buzz in my ears
well i take to my heel and i run after the cab
i have a heavy oak stick in my hand and i tell you i saw red from the first but as i run i get cunning too and hang back a little to see them without be see
they pull up soon at the railway station
there be a good crowd round the book office so i get quite close to them without be see
they take ticket for new brighton
so do i but i get in three carriages behind them
when we reach it they walk along the parade and i be never more than a hundred yards from them
at last i saw them hire a boat and start for a row for it be a very hot day and they think no doubt that it would be cooler on the water
it be just as if they have be give into my hand
there be a bite of a haze and you could not see more than a few hundred yards
i hire a boat for myself and i pull after them
i could see the blur of their craft but they be go nearly as fast as i and they must have be a long mile from the shore before i catch them up
the haze be like a curtain all round us and there be we three in the middle of it
my god shall i ever forget their face when they saw who be in the boat that be close in upon them
she scream out
he swear like a madman and jab at me with an oar for he must have see death in my eye
i get past it and get one in with my stick that crush his head like an egg
i would have spar her perhaps for all my madness but she throw her arm round him cry out to him and call him 'alec ' i strike again and she lay stretch beside him
i be like a wild beast then that have taste blood
if sarah have be there by the lord she should have join them
i pull out my knife and well there
i've say enough
it give me a kind of savage joy when i think how sarah would feel when she have such sign as these of what her meddle have bring about
then i tie the body into the boat stave a plank and stand by until they have sink
i know very well that the owner would think that they have lose their bear in the haze and have drift off out to sea
i clean myself up get back to land and join my ship without a soul have a suspicion of what have pass
that night i make up the packet for sarah cushing and next day i send it from belfast
there you have the whole truth of it
you can hang me or do what you like with me but you cannot punish me as i have be punish already
i cannot shut my eye but i see those two face star at me star at me as they star when my boat break through the haze
i kill them quick but they be kill me slow and if i have another night of it i shall be either mad or dead before morning
you won't put me alone into a cell sir
for pity's sake don't and may you be treat in your day of agony as you treat me now ' what be the mean of it watson say holmes solemnly as he lay down the paper
what object be serve by this circle of misery and violence and fear
it must tend to some end or else our universe be rule by chance which be unthinkable
but what end
there be the great stand perennial problem to which human reason be as far from an answer as ever an anomaly which often strike me in the character of my friend sherlock holmes be that although in his methods of think he be the neatest and most methodical of mankind and although also he affect a certain quiet primness of dress he be none the less in his personal habit one of the most untidy men that ever drive a fellow lodger to distraction
not that i be in the least conventional in that respect myself
the rough and tumble work in afghanistan come on the top of a natural bohemianism of disposition have make me rather more lax than befit a medical man
but with me there be a limit and when i find a man who keep his cigars in the coal scuttle his tobacco in the toe end of a persian slipper and his unanswered correspondence transfix by a jack knife into the very centre of his wooden mantelpiece then i begin to give myself virtuous air
i have always hold too that pistol practice should be distinctly an open air pastime and when holmes in one of his queer humour would sit in an armchair with his hair trigger and a hundred boxer cartridges and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with a patriotic v r do in bullet pock i felt strongly that neither the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room be improve by it
our chamber be always full of chemicals and of criminal relics which have a way of wander into unlikely position and of turn up in the butter dish or in even less desirable place
but his paper be my great crux
he have a horror of destroy document especially those which be connect with his past case and yet it be only once in every year or two that he would muster energy to docket and arrange them for as i have mention somewhere in these incoherent memoirs the outbursts of passionate energy when he perform the remarkable feats with which his name be associate be follow by reactions of lethargy during which he would lie about with his violin and his book hardly move save from the sofa to the table
thus month after month his paper accumulate until every corner of the room be stack with bundle of manuscript which be on no account to be burn and which could not be put away save by their owner
one winter's night as we sit together by the fire i venture to suggest to him that as he have finish paste extract into his common place book he might employ the next two hours in make our room a little more habitable
he could not deny the justice of my request so with a rather rueful face he go off to his bedroom from which he return presently pull a large tin box behind him
this he place in the middle of the floor and squat down upon a stool in front of it he throw back the lid
i could see that it be already a third full of bundle of paper tie up with red tape into separate package
there be case enough here watson say he look at me with mischievous eye
i think that if you know all that i have in this box you would ask me to pull some out instead of put others in these be the record of your early work then i ask
i have often wish that i have note of those case yes my boy these be all do prematurely before my biographer have come to glorify me he lift bundle after bundle in a tender caress sort of way
they be not all successes watson say he
but there be some pretty little problems among them
here's the record of the tarleton murder and the case of vamberry the wine merchant and the adventure of the old russian woman and the singular affair of the aluminium crutch as well as a full account of ricoletti of the club foot and his abominable wife
and here ah now this really be something a little _recherche_ he dive his arm down to the bottom of the chest and bring up a small wooden box with a slide lid such as children's toy be keep in
from within he produce a crumple piece of paper an old fashion brass key a peg of wood with a ball of string attach to it and three rusty old disk of metal
well my boy what do you make of this lot he ask smile at my expression
it be a curious collection very curious and the story that hang round it will strike you as be more curious still these relics have a history then so much so that they _are_ history what do you mean by that sherlock holmes pick them up one by one and lay them along the edge of the table
then he reseat himself in his chair and look them over with a gleam of satisfaction in his eye
these say he be all that i have leave to remind me of the adventure of the musgrave ritual i have hear him mention the case more than once though i have never be able to gather the detail
i should be so glad say i if you would give me an account of it and leave the litter as it be he cry mischievously
your tidiness won't bear much strain after all watson
but i should be glad that you should add this case to your annals for there be point in it which make it quite unique in the criminal record of this or i believe of any other country
a collection of my trifle achievements would certainly be incomplete which contain no account of this very singular business
you may remember how the affair of the _gloria scott_ and my conversation with the unhappy man whose fate i tell you of first turn my attention in the direction of the profession which have become my life's work
you see me now when my name have become know far and wide and when i be generally recognise both by the public and by the official force as be a final court of appeal in doubtful case
even when you know me first at the time of the affair which you have commemorate in 'a study in scarlet ' i have already establish a considerable though not a very lucrative connection
you can hardly realize then how difficult i find it at first and how long i have to wait before i succeed in make any headway
when i first come up to london i have room in montague street just round the corner from the british museum and there i wait fill in my too abundant leisure time by study all those branch of science which might make me more efficient
now and again case come in my way principally through the introduction of old fellow students for during my last years at the university there be a good deal of talk there about myself and my methods
the third of these case be that of the musgrave ritual and it be to the interest which be arouse by that singular chain of events and the large issue which prove to be at stake that i trace my first stride towards the position which i now hold
reginald musgrave have be in the same college as myself and i have some slight acquaintance with him
he be not generally popular among the undergraduates though it always seem to me that what be set down as pride be really an attempt to cover extreme natural diffidence
in appearance he be a man of exceedingly aristocratic type thin high nose and large eye with languid and yet courtly manners
he be indeed a scion of one of the very oldest families in the kingdom though his branch be a cadet one which have separate from the northern musgraves some time in the sixteenth century and have establish itself in western sussex where the manor house of hurlstone be perhaps the oldest inhabit build in the county
something of his birthplace seem to cling to the man and i never look at his pale keen face or the poise of his head without associate him with grey archways and mullioned windows and all the venerable wreckage of a feudal keep
once or twice we drift into talk and i can remember that more than once he express a keen interest in my methods of observation and inference
for four years i have see nothing of him until one morning he walk into my room in montague street
he have change little be dress like a young man of fashion he be always a bite of a dandy and preserve the same quiet suave manner which have formerly distinguish him
'how have all go with you musgrave ' i ask after we have cordially shake hand
'you probably hear of my poor father's death ' say he 'he be carry off about two years ago
since then i have of course have the hurlstone estates to manage and as i be member for my district as well my life have be a busy one
but i understand holmes that you be turn to practical end those power with which you use to amaze us ' 'yes ' say i 'i have take to live by my wits ' 'i be delight to hear it for your advice at present would be exceedingly valuable to me
we have have some very strange do at hurlstone and the police have be able to throw no light upon the matter
it be really the most extraordinary and inexplicable business ' you can imagine with what eagerness i listen to him watson for the very chance for which i have be pant during all those months of inaction seem to have come within my reach
in my inmost heart i believe that i could succeed where others fail and now i have the opportunity to test myself
'pray let me have the detail ' i cry
reginald musgrave sit down opposite to me and light the cigarette which i have push towards him
'you must know ' say he 'that though i be a bachelor i have to keep up a considerable staff of servants at hurlstone for it be a ramble old place and take a good deal of look after
i preserve too and in the pheasant months i usually have a house party so that it would not do to be short hand
altogether there be eight maids the cook the butler two footmen and a boy
the garden and the stable of course have a separate staff
'of these servants the one who have be longest in our service be brunton the butler
he be a young schoolmaster out of place when he be first take up by my father but he be a man of great energy and character and he soon become quite invaluable in the household
he be a well grow handsome man with a splendid forehead and though he have be with us for twenty years he cannot be more than forty now
with his personal advantage and his extraordinary gift for he can speak several languages and play nearly every musical instrument it be wonderful that he should have be satisfy so long in such a position but i suppose that he be comfortable and lack energy to make any change
the butler of hurlstone be always a thing that be remember by all who visit us
'but this paragon have one fault
he be a bite of a don juan and you can imagine that for a man like him it be not a very difficult part to play in a quiet country district
when he be marry it be all right but since he have be a widower we have have no end of trouble with him
a few months ago we be in hop that he be about to settle down again for he become engage to rachel howells our second housemaid but he have throw her over since then and take up with janet tregellis the daughter of the head gamekeeper
rachel who be a very good girl but of an excitable welsh temperament have a sharp touch of brain fever and go about the house now or do until yesterday like a black eye shadow of her former self
that be our first drama at hurlstone but a second one come to drive it from our mind and it be preface by the disgrace and dismissal of butler brunton
'this be how it come about
i have say that the man be intelligent and this very intelligence have cause his ruin for it seem to have lead to an insatiable curiosity about things which do not in the least concern him
i have no idea of the lengths to which this would carry him until the merest accident open my eye to it
'i have say that the house be a ramble one
one day last week on thursday night to be more exact i find that i could not sleep have foolishly take a cup of strong _cafe noir_ after my dinner
after struggle against it until two in the morning i felt that it be quite hopeless so i rise and light the candle with the intention of continue a novel which i be read
the book however have be leave in the billiard room so i pull on my dress gown and start off to get it
'in order to reach the billiard room i have to descend a flight of stairs and then to cross the head of a passage which lead to the library and the gun room
you can imagine my surprise when as i look down this corridor i saw a glimmer of light come from the open door of the library
i have myself extinguish the lamp and close the door before come to bed
naturally my first think be of burglars
the corridors at hurlstone have their wall largely decorate with trophies of old weapons
from one of these i pick a battle axe and then leave my candle behind me i creep on tiptoe down the passage and peep in at the open door
'brunton the butler be in the library
he be sit fully dress in an easy chair with a slip of paper which look like a map upon his knee and his forehead sink forward upon his hand in deep think
i stand dumb with astonishment watch him from the darkness
a small taper on the edge of the table shed a feeble light which suffice to show me that he be fully dress
suddenly as i look he rise from his chair and walk over to a bureau at the side he unlock it and draw out one of the drawers
from this he take a paper and return to his seat he flatten it out beside the taper on the edge of the table and begin to study it with minute attention
my indignation at this calm examination of our family document overcome me so far that i take a step forward and brunton look up saw me stand in the doorway
he spring to his feet his face turn livid with fear and he thrust into his breast the chart like paper which he have be originally study
' so say i
this be how you repay the trust which we have repose in you
you will leave my service to morrow 'he bow with the look of a man who be utterly crush and slink past me without a word
the taper be still on the table and by its light i glance to see what the paper be which brunton have take from the bureau
to my surprise it be nothing of any importance at all but simply a copy of the question and answer in the singular old observance call the musgrave ritual
it be a sort of ceremony peculiar to our family which each musgrave for centuries past have go through on his come of age a thing of private interest and perhaps of some little importance to the archaeologist like our own blazon and charge but of no practical use whatever ' 'we have better come back to the paper afterwards ' say i
'if you think it really necessary ' he answer with some hesitation
'to continue my statement however i relocked the bureau use the key which brunton have leave and i have turn to go when i be surprise to find that the butler have return and be stand before me
' mr
musgrave sir he cry in a voice which be hoarse with emotion i can't bear disgrace sir
i've always be proud above my station in life and disgrace would kill me
my blood will be on your head sir it will indeed if you drive me to despair
if you cannot keep me after what have pass then for god's sake let me give you notice and leave in a month as if of my own free will
i could stand that mr
musgrave but not to be cast out before all the folk that i know so well ' you don't deserve much consideration brunton i answer
your conduct have be most infamous
however as you have be a long time in the family i have no wish to bring public disgrace upon you
a month however be too long
take yourself away in a week and give what reason you like for go ' only a week sir he cry in a despair voice
a fortnight say at least a fortnight ' a week i repeat and you may consider yourself to have be very leniently deal with 'he creep away his face sink upon his breast like a break man while i put out the light and return to my room
'for two days after this brunton be most assiduous in his attention to his duties
i make no allusion to what have pass and wait with some curiosity to see how he would cover his disgrace
on the third morning however he do not appear as be his custom after breakfast to receive my instructions for the day
as i leave the din room i happen to meet rachel howells the maid
i have tell you that she have only recently recover from an illness and be look so wretchedly pale and wan that i remonstrate with her for be at work
' you should be in bed i say
come back to your duties when you be stronger 'she look at me with so strange an expression that i begin to suspect that her brain be affect
' i be strong enough mr
musgrave say she
' we will see what the doctor say i answer
you must stop work now and when you go downstairs just say that i wish to see brunton ' the butler be go say she
' go
go where ' he be go
no one have see him
he be not in his room
oh yes he be go he be go she fell back against the wall with shriek after shriek of laughter while i horrify at this sudden hysterical attack rush to the bell to summon help
the girl be take to her room still scream and sob while i make inquiries about brunton
there be no doubt about it that he have disappear
his bed have not be sleep in he have be see by no one since he have retire to his room the night before and yet it be difficult to see how he could have leave the house as both windows and doors be find to be fasten in the morning
his clothe his watch and even his money be in his room but the black suit which he usually wear be miss
his slippers too be go but his boot be leave behind
where then could butler brunton have go in the night and what could have become of him now
'of course we search the house from cellar to garret but there be no trace of him
it be as i have say a labyrinth of an old house especially the original wing which be now practically uninhabited but we ransack every room and cellar without discover the least sign of the miss man
it be incredible to me that he could have go away leave all his property behind him and yet where could he be
i call in the local police but without success
rain have fall on the night before and we examine the lawn and the paths all round the house but in vain
matter be in this state when a new development quite draw our attention away from the original mystery
'for two days rachel howells have be so ill sometimes delirious sometimes hysterical that a nurse have be employ to sit up with her at night
on the third night after brunton's disappearance the nurse find her patient sleep nicely have drop into a nap in the armchair when she wake in the early morning to find the bed empty the window open and no sign of the invalid
i be instantly arouse and with the two footmen start off at once in search of the miss girl
it be not difficult to tell the direction which she have take for start from under her window we could follow her footmarks easily across the lawn to the edge of the mere where they vanish close to the gravel path which lead out of the ground
the lake there be eight feet deep and you can imagine our feel when we saw that the trail of the poor demented girl come to an end at the edge of it
'of course we have the drag at once and set to work to recover the remain but no trace of the body could we find
on the other hand we bring to the surface an object of a most unexpected kind
it be a linen bag which contain within it a mass of old rust and discolour metal and several dull colour piece of pebble or glass
this strange find be all that we could get from the mere and although we make every possible search and inquiry yesterday we know nothing of the fate either of rachel howells or of richard brunton
the county police be at their wits' end and i have come up to you as a last resource ' you can imagine watson with what eagerness i listen to this extraordinary sequence of events and endeavour to piece them together and to devise some common thread upon which they might all hang
the butler be go
the maid be go
the maid have love the butler but have afterwards have cause to hate him
she be of welsh blood fiery and passionate
she have be terribly excite immediately after his disappearance
she have fling into the lake a bag contain some curious content
these be all factor which have to be take into consideration and yet none of them get quite to the heart of the matter
what be the start point of this chain of events
there lay the end of this tangle line
'i must see that paper musgrave ' say i 'which this butler of yours think it worth his while to consult even at the risk of the loss of his place ' 'it be rather an absurd business this ritual of ours ' he answer
'but it have at least the save grace of antiquity to excuse it
i have a copy of the question and answer here if you care to run your eye over them ' he hand me the very paper which i have here watson and this be the strange catechism to which each musgrave have to submit when he come to man's estate
i will read you the question and answer as they stand
'whose be it ' 'his who be go ' 'who shall have it ' 'he who will come ' 'where be the sun ' 'over the oak ' 'where be the shadow ' 'under the elm ' how be it step ' 'north by ten and by ten east by five and by five south by two and by two west by one and by one and so under ' 'what shall we give for it ' 'all that be ours ' 'why should we give it ' 'for the sake of the trust ' 'the original have no date but be in the spell of the middle of the seventeenth century ' remark musgrave
'i be afraid however that it can be of little help to you in solve this mystery ' 'at least ' say i 'it give us another mystery and one which be even more interest than the first
it may be that the solution of the one may prove to be the solution of the other
you will excuse me musgrave if i say that your butler appear to me to have be a very clever man and to have have a clearer insight than ten generations of his master ' 'i hardly follow you ' say musgrave
'the paper seem to me to be of no practical importance ' 'but to me it seem immensely practical and i fancy that brunton take the same view
he have probably see it before that night on which you catch him ' 'it be very possible
we take no pain to hide it ' 'he simply wish i should imagine to refresh his memory upon that last occasion
he have as i understand some sort of map or chart which he be compare with the manuscript and which he thrust into his pocket when you appear ' 'that be true
but what could he have to do with this old family custom of ours and what do this rigmarole mean ' 'i don't think that we should have much difficulty in determine that ' say i 'with your permission we will take the first train down to sussex and go a little more deeply into the matter upon the spot ' the same afternoon saw us both at hurlstone
possibly you have see picture and read descriptions of the famous old build so i will confine my account of it to say that it be build in the shape of an l the long arm be the more modern portion and the shorter the ancient nucleus from which the other have develop
over the low heavily lintelled door in the centre of this old part be chisel the date but experts be agree that the beam and stonework be really much older than this
the enormously thick wall and tiny windows of this part have in the last century drive the family into build the new wing and the old one be use now as a storehouse and a cellar when it be use at all
a splendid park with fine old timber surround the house and the lake to which my client have refer lay close to the avenue about two hundred yards from the build
i be already firmly convince watson that there be not three separate mysteries here but one only and that if i could read the musgrave ritual aright i should hold in my hand the clue which would lead me to the truth concern both the butler brunton and the maid howells
to that then i turn all my energies
why should this servant be so anxious to master this old formula
evidently because he saw something in it which have escape all those generations of country squire and from which he expect some personal advantage
what be it then and how have it affect his fate
it be perfectly obvious to me on read the ritual that the measurements must refer to some spot to which the rest of the document allude and that if we could find that spot we should be in a fair way towards find what the secret be which the old musgraves have think it necessary to embalm in so curious a fashion
there be two guide give us to start with an oak and an elm
as to the oak there could be no question at all
right in front of the house upon the leave hand side of the drive there stand a patriarch among oaks one of the most magnificent tree that i have ever see
'that be there when your ritual be draw up ' say i as we drive past it
'it be there at the norman conquest in all probability ' he answer
'it have a girth of twenty three feet ' 'have you any old elms ' i ask
'there use to be a very old one over yonder but it be strike by lightning ten years ago and we cut down the stump ' 'you can see where it use to be ' 'oh yes ' 'there be no other elms ' 'no old ones but plenty of beeches ' 'i should like to see where it grow ' we have drive up in a dog cart and my client lead me away at once without our enter the house to the scar on the lawn where the elm have stand
it be nearly midway between the oak and the house
my investigation seem to be progress
'i suppose it be impossible to find out how high the elm be ' i ask
'i can give you it at once
it be sixty four feet ' 'how do you come to know it ' i ask in surprise
'when my old tutor use to give me an exercise in trigonometry it always take the shape of measure heights
when i be a lad i work out every tree and build in the estate ' this be an unexpected piece of luck
my data be come more quickly than i could have reasonably hop
'tell me ' i ask 'did your butler ever ask you such a question ' reginald musgrave look at me in astonishment
'now that you call it to my mind ' he answer 'brunton _did_ ask me about the height of the tree some months ago in connection with some little argument with the groom ' this be excellent news watson for it show me that i be on the right road
i look up at the sun
it be low in the heavens and i calculate that in less than an hour it would lie just above the topmost branch of the old oak
one condition mention in the ritual would then be fulfil
and the shadow of the elm must mean the farther end of the shadow otherwise the trunk would have be choose as the guide
i have then to find where the far end of the shadow would fall when the sun be just clear of the oak that must have be difficult holmes when the elm be no longer there well at least i know that if brunton could do it i could also
besides there be no real difficulty
i go with musgrave to his study and whittle myself this peg to which i tie this long string with a knot at each yard
then i take two lengths of a fish rod which come to just six feet and i go back with my client to where the elm have be
the sun be just graze the top of the oak
i fasten the rod on end mark out the direction of the shadow and measure it
it be nine feet in length
of course the calculation now be a simple one
if a rod of six feet throw a shadow of nine a tree of sixty four feet would throw one of ninety six and the line of the one would of course be the line of the other
i measure out the distance which bring me almost to the wall of the house and i thrust a peg into the spot
you can imagine my exultation watson when within two inch of my peg i saw a conical depression in the grind
i know that it be the mark make by brunton in his measurements and that i be still upon his trail
from this start point i proceed to step have first take the cardinal point by my pocket compass
ten step with each foot take me along parallel with the wall of the house and again i mark my spot with a peg
then i carefully pace off five to the east and two to the south
it bring me to the very threshold of the old door
two step to the west mean now that i be to go two pace down the stone flag passage and this be the place indicate by the ritual
never have i felt such a cold chill of disappointment watson
for a moment it seem to me that there must be some radical mistake in my calculations
the set sun shine full upon the passage floor and i could see that the old foot wear grey stone with which it be pave be firmly cement together and have certainly not be move for many a long year
brunton have not be at work here
i tap upon the floor but it sound the same all over and there be no sign of any crack or crevice
but fortunately musgrave who have begin to appreciate the mean of my proceed and who be now as excite as myself take out his manuscript to check my calculation
'and under ' he cry
'you have omit the and under ' i have think that it mean that we be to dig but now of course i saw at once that i be wrong
'there be a cellar under this then ' i cry
'yes and as old as the house
down here through this door ' we go down a wind stone stair and my companion strike a match light a large lantern which stand on a barrel in the corner
in an instant it be obvious that we have at last come upon the true place and that we have not be the only people to visit the spot recently
it have be use for the storage of wood but the billet which have evidently be litter over the floor be now pile at the side so as to leave a clear space in the middle
in this space lay a large and heavy flagstone with a rust iron ring in the centre to which a thick shepherd's check muffler be attach
'by jove ' cry my client
'that's brunton's muffler
i have see it on him and could swear to it
what have the villain be do here ' at my suggestion a couple of the county police be summon to be present and i then endeavour to raise the stone by pull on the cravat
i could only move it slightly and it be with the aid of one of the constables that i succeed at last in carry it to one side
a black hole yawn beneath into which we all peer while musgrave kneel at the side push down the lantern
a small chamber about seven feet deep and four feet square lay open to us
at one side of this be a squat brass bind wooden box the lid of which be hinge upwards with this curious old fashion key project from the lock
it be furred outside by a thick layer of dust and damp and worm have eat through the wood so that a crop of livid fungi be grow on the inside of it
several discs of metal old coin apparently such as i hold here be scatter over the bottom of the box but it contain nothing else
at the moment however we have no think for the old chest for our eye be rivet upon that which crouch beside it
it be the figure of a man clothe in a suit of black who squat down upon his ham with his forehead sink upon the edge of the box and his two arm throw out on each side of it
the attitude have draw all the stagnant blood to the face and no man could have recognise that distort liver colour countenance but his height his dress and his hair be all sufficient to show my client when we have draw the body up that it be indeed his miss butler
he have be dead some days but there be no wind or bruise upon his person to show how he have meet his dreadful end
when his body have be carry from the cellar we find ourselves still confront with a problem which be almost as formidable as that with which we have start
i confess that so far watson i have be disappoint in my investigation
i have reckon upon solve the matter when once i have find the place refer to in the ritual but now i be there and be apparently as far as ever from know what it be which the family have conceal with such elaborate precautions
it be true that i have throw a light upon the fate of brunton but now i have to ascertain how that fate have come upon him and what part have be play in the matter by the woman who have disappear
i sit down upon a keg in the corner and think the whole matter carefully over
you know my methods in such case watson
i put myself in the man's place and have first gauge his intelligence i try to imagine how i should myself have proceed under the same circumstances
in this case the matter be simplify by brunton's intelligence be quite first rate so that it be unnecessary to make any allowance for the personal equation as the astronomers have dub it
he know that something valuable be conceal
he have spot the place
he find that the stone which cover it be just too heavy for a man to move unaided
what would he do next
he could not get help from outside even if he have some one whom he could trust without the unbar of doors and considerable risk of detection
it be better if he could to have his helpmate inside the house
but whom could he ask
this girl have be devote to him
a man always find it hard to realize that he may have finally lose a woman's love however badly he may have treat her
he would try by a few attentions to make his peace with the girl howells and then would engage her as his accomplice
together they would come at night to the cellar and their unite force would suffice to raise the stone
so far i could follow their action as if i have actually see them
but for two of them and one a woman it must have be heavy work the raise of that stone
a burly sussex policeman and i have find it no light job
what would they do to assist them
probably what i should have do myself
i rise and examine carefully the different billet of wood which be scatter round the floor
almost at once i come upon what i expect
one piece about three feet in length have a very mark indentation at one end while several be flatten at the side as if they have be compress by some considerable weight
evidently as they have drag the stone up they have thrust the chunk of wood into the chink until at last when the open be large enough to crawl through they would hold it open by a billet place lengthwise which might very well become indent at the lower end since the whole weight of the stone would press it down on to the edge of this other slab
so far i be still on safe grind
and now how be i to proceed to reconstruct this midnight drama
clearly only one could fit into the hole and that one be brunton
the girl must have wait above
brunton then unlock the box hand up the content presumably since they be not to be find and then and then what happen
what smoulder fire of vengeance have suddenly spring into flame in this passionate celtic woman's soul when she saw the man who have wrong her wrong her perhaps far more than we suspect in her power
be it a chance that the wood have slip and that the stone have shut brunton into what have become his sepulchre
have she only be guilty of silence as to his fate
or have some sudden blow from her hand dash the support away and send the slab crash down into its place
be that as it might i seem to see that woman's figure still clutch at her treasure trove and fly wildly up the wind stair with her ears ring perhaps with the muffle scream from behind her and with the drum of frenzied hand against the slab of stone which be choke her faithless lover's life out
here be the secret of her blanch face her shake nerve her peal of hysterical laughter on the next morning
but what have be in the box
what have she do with that
of course it must have be the old metal and pebbles which my client have drag from the mere
she have throw them in there at the first opportunity to remove the last trace of her crime
for twenty minutes i have sit motionless think the matter out
musgrave still stand with a very pale face swing his lantern and peer down into the hole
'these be coin of charles the first ' say he hold out the few which have be in the box 'you see we be right in fix our date for the ritual ' 'we may find something else of charles the first ' i cry as the probable mean of the first two question of the ritual break suddenly upon me
'let me see the content of the bag which you fish from the mere ' we ascend to his study and he lay the _debris_ before me
i could understand his regard it as of small importance when i look at it for the metal be almost black and the stone lustreless and dull
i rub one of them on my sleeve however and it glow afterwards like a spark in the dark hollow of my hand
the metal work be in the form of a double ring but it have be bend and twist out of its original shape
'you must bear in mind ' say i 'that the royal party make head in england even after the death of the king and that when they at last flee they probably leave many of their most precious possessions bury behind them with the intention of return for them in more peaceful time ' 'my ancestor sir ralph musgrave be a prominent cavalier and the right hand man of charles the second in his wander ' say my friend
'ah indeed ' i answer
'well now i think that really should give us the last link that we want
i must congratulate you on come into the possession though in rather a tragic manner of a relic which be of great intrinsic value but of even greater importance as an historical curiosity ' 'what be it then ' he gasp in astonishment
'it be nothing less than the ancient crown of the kings of england ' 'the crown ' 'precisely
consider what the ritual say how do it run
whose be it his who be go that be after the execution of charles
then who shall have it he who will come that be charles the second whose advent be already foresee
there can i think be no doubt that this batter and shapeless diadem once encircle the brows of the royal stuarts ' 'and how come it in the pond ' 'ah that be a question that will take some time to answer ' and with that i sketch out to him the whole long chain of surmise and of proof which i have construct
the twilight have close in and the moon be shin brightly in the sky before my narrative be finish
'and how be it then that charles do not get his crown when he return ' ask musgrave push back the relic into its linen bag
'ah there you lay your finger upon the one point which we shall probably never be able to clear up
it be likely that the musgrave who hold the secret die in the interval and by some oversight leave this guide to his descendant without explain the mean of it
from that day to this it have be hand down from father to son until at last it come within reach of a man who tear its secret out of it and lose his life in the venture ' and that's the story of the musgrave ritual watson
they have the crown down at hurlstone though they have some legal bother and a considerable sum to pay before they be allow to retain it
i be sure that if you mention my name they would be happy to show it to you
of the woman nothing be ever hear and the probability be that she get away out of england and carry herself and the memory of her crime to some land beyond the seas it be some time before the health of my friend mr
sherlock holmes recover from the strain cause by his immense exertions in the spring of '
the whole question of the netherland sumatra company and of the colossal scheme of baron maupertuis be too recent in the mind of the public and be too intimately concern with politics and finance to be fit subject for this series of sketch
they lead however in an indirect fashion to a singular and complex problem which give my friend an opportunity of demonstrate the value of a fresh weapon among the many with which he wag his life long battle against crime
on refer to my note i see that it be upon the 14th of april that i receive a telegram from lyons which inform me that holmes be lie ill in the hotel dulong
within twenty four hours i be in his sick room and be relieve to find that there be nothing formidable in his symptoms
even his iron constitution however have break down under the strain of an investigation which have extend over two months during which period he have never work less than fifteen hours a day and have more than once as he assure me keep to his task for five days at a stretch
even the triumphant issue of his labour could not save him from reaction after so terrible an exertion and at a time when europe be ring with his name and when his room be literally ankle deep with congratulatory telegrams i find him a prey to the blackest depression
even the knowledge that he have succeed where the police of three countries have fail and that he have outmanoeuvre at every point the most accomplish swindler in europe be insufficient to rouse him from his nervous prostration
three days later we be back in baker street together but it be evident that my friend would be much the better for a change and the think of a week of spring time in the country be full of attractions to me also
my old friend colonel hayter who have come under my professional care in afghanistan have now take a house near reigate in surrey and have frequently ask me to come down to him upon a visit
on the last occasion he have remark that if my friend would only come with me he would be glad to extend his hospitality to him also
a little diplomacy be need but when holmes understand that the establishment be a bachelor one and that he would be allow the fullest freedom he fell in with my plan and a week after our return from lyons we be under the colonel's roof
hayter be a fine old soldier who have see much of the world and he soon find as i have expect that holmes and he have much in common
on the even of our arrival we be sit in the colonel's gun room after dinner holmes stretch upon the sofa while hayter and i look over his little armoury of fire arm
by the way say he suddenly i think i'll take one of these pistols upstairs with me in case we have an alarm an alarm say i
yes we've have a scare in this part lately
old acton who be one of our county magnates have his house break into last monday
no great damage do but the fellows be still at large no clue ask holmes cock his eye at the colonel
none as yet
but the affair be a petty one one of our little country crimes which must seem too small for your attention mr
holmes after this great international affair holmes wave away the compliment though his smile show that it have please him
be there any feature of interest i fancy not
the thieve ransack the library and get very little for their pain
the whole place be turn upside down drawers burst open and press ransack with the result that an odd volume of pope's 'homer ' two plat candlesticks an ivory letter weight a small oak barometer and a ball of twine be all that have vanish what an extraordinary assortment i exclaim
oh the fellows evidently grab hold of everything they could get holmes grunt from the sofa
the county police ought to make something of that say he why it be surely obvious that but i hold up a warn finger
you be here for a rest my dear fellow
for heaven's sake don't get start on a new problem when your nerve be all in shred holmes shrug his shoulder with a glance of comic resignation towards the colonel and the talk drift away into less dangerous channel
it be destine however that all my professional caution should be waste for next morning the problem obtrude itself upon us in such a way that it be impossible to ignore it and our country visit take a turn which neither of us could have anticipate
we be at breakfast when the colonel's butler rush in with all his propriety shake out of him
have you hear the news sir he gasp
at the cunningham's sir burglary cry the colonel with his coffee cup in mid air
murder the colonel whistle
by jove say he
who's kill then
the j p
or his son neither sir
it be william the coachman
shoot through the heart sir and never speak again who shoot him then the burglar sir
he be off like a shoot and get clean away
he'd just break in at the pantry window when william come on him and meet his end in save his master's property what time it be last night sir somewhere about twelve ah then we'll step over afterwards say the colonel coolly settle down to his breakfast again
it's a baddish business he add when the butler have go he's our lead man about here be old cunningham and a very decent fellow too
he'll be cut up over this for the man have be in his service for years and be a good servant
it's evidently the same villains who break into acton's and steal that very singular collection say holmes thoughtfully
precisely hum
it may prove the simplest matter in the world but all the same at first glance this be just a little curious be it not
a gang of burglars act in the country might be expect to vary the scene of their operations and not to crack two crib in the same district within a few days
when you speak last night of take precautions i remember that it pass through my mind that this be probably the last parish in england to which the thief or thieve would be likely to turn their attention which show that i have still much to learn i fancy it's some local practitioner say the colonel
in that case of course acton's and cunningham's be just the place he would go for since they be far the largest about here and richest well they ought to be but they've have a lawsuit for some years which have suck the blood out of both of them i fancy
old acton have some claim on half cunningham's estate and the lawyers have be at it with both hand if it's a local villain there should not be much difficulty in run him down say holmes with a yawn
all right watson i don't intend to meddle inspector forrester sir say the butler throw open the door
the official a smart keen face young fellow step into the room
good morning colonel say he i hope i don't intrude but we hear that mr
holmes of baker street be here the colonel wave his hand towards my friend and the inspector bow
we think that perhaps you would care to step across mr
holmes the fat be against you watson say he laugh
we be chat about the matter when you come in inspector
perhaps you can let us have a few detail as he lean back in his chair in the familiar attitude i know that the case be hopeless
we have no clue in the acton affair
but here we have plenty to go on and there's no doubt it be the same party in each case
the man be see ah yes sir
but he be off like a deer after the shoot that kill poor william kirwan be fire
mr
cunningham saw him from the bedroom window and mr
alec cunningham saw him from the back passage
it be quarter to twelve when the alarm break out
mr
cunningham have just get into bed and mr
alec be smoke a pipe in his dress gown
they both hear william the coachman call for help and mr
alec run down to see what be the matter
the back door be open and as he come to the foot of the stairs he saw two men wrestle together outside
one of them fire a shoot the other drop and the murderer rush across the garden and over the hedge
mr
cunningham look out of his bedroom saw the fellow as he gain the road but lose sight of him at once
mr
alec stop to see if he could help the die man and so the villain get clean away
beyond the fact that he be a middle size man and dress in some dark stuff we have no personal clue but we be make energetic inquiries and if he be a stranger we shall soon find him out what be this william do there
do he say anything before he die not a word
he live at the lodge with his mother and as he be a very faithful fellow we imagine that he walk up to the house with the intention of see that all be right there
of course this acton business have put every one on their guard
the robber must have just burst open the door the lock have be force when william come upon him do william say anything to his mother before go out she be very old and deaf and we can get no information from her
the shock have make her half witted but i understand that she be never very bright
there be one very important circumstance however
look at this he take a small piece of tear paper from a note book and spread it out upon his knee
this be find between the finger and thumb of the dead man
it appear to be a fragment tear from a larger sheet
you will observe that the hour mention upon it be the very time at which the poor fellow meet his fate
you see that his murderer might have tear the rest of the sheet from him or he might have take this fragment from the murderer
it read almost as though it be an appointment holmes take up the scrap of paper a facsimile of which be here reproduce
scrap of paper presume that it be an appointment continue the inspector it be of course a conceivable theory that this william kirwan though he have the reputation of be an honest man may have be in league with the thief
he may have meet him there may even have help him to break in the door and then they may have fall out between themselves this write be of extraordinary interest say holmes who have be examine it with intense concentration
these be much deeper water than i have think he sink his head upon his hand while the inspector smile at the effect which his case have have upon the famous london specialist
your last remark say holmes presently as to the possibility of there be an understand between the burglar and the servant and this be a note of appointment from one to the other be an ingenious and not entirely impossible supposition
but this write open up he sink his head into his hand again and remain for some minutes in the deepest think
when he raise his face again i be surprise to see that his cheek be ting with colour and his eye as bright as before his illness
he spring to his feet with all his old energy
i'll tell you what say he i should like to have a quiet little glance into the detail of this case
there be something in it which fascinate me extremely
if you will permit me colonel i will leave my friend watson and you and i will step round with the inspector to test the truth of one or two little fancy of mine
i will be with you again in half an hour an hour and half have elapse before the inspector return alone
mr
holmes be walk up and down in the field outside say he
he want us all four to go up to the house together to mr
cunningham's yes sir what for the inspector shrug his shoulder
i don't quite know sir
between ourselves i think mr
holmes have not quite get over his illness yet
he's be behave very queerly and he be very much excite i don't think you need alarm yourself say i
i have usually find that there be method in his madness some folks might say there be madness in his method mutter the inspector
but he's all on fire to start colonel so we have best go out if you be ready we find holmes pace up and down in the field his chin sink upon his breast and his hand thrust into his trousers pocket
the matter grow in interest say he
watson your country trip have be a distinct success
i have have a charm morning you have be up to the scene of the crime i understand say the colonel
yes the inspector and i have make quite a little reconnaissance together any success well we have see some very interest things
i'll tell you what we do as we walk
first of all we saw the body of this unfortunate man
he certainly die from a revolver wind as report have you doubt it then oh it be as well to test everything
our inspection be not waste
we then have an interview with mr
cunningham and his son who be able to point out the exact spot where the murderer have break through the garden hedge in his flight
that be of great interest naturally then we have a look at this poor fellow's mother
we could get no information from her however as she be very old and feeble and what be the result of your investigations the conviction that the crime be a very peculiar one
perhaps our visit now may do something to make it less obscure
i think that we be both agree inspector that the fragment of paper in the dead man's hand bear as it do the very hour of his death write upon it be of extreme importance it should give a clue mr
holmes it _does_ give a clue
whoever write that note be the man who bring william kirwan out of his bed at that hour
but where be the rest of that sheet of paper i examine the grind carefully in the hope of find it say the inspector
it be tear out of the dead man's hand
why be some one so anxious to get possession of it
because it incriminate him
and what would he do with it
thrust it into his pocket most likely never notice that a corner of it have be leave in the grip of the corpse
if we could get the rest of that sheet it be obvious that we should have go a long way towards solve the mystery yes but how can we get at the criminal's pocket before we catch the criminal well well it be worth think over
then there be another obvious point
the note be send to william
the man who write it could not have take it otherwise of course he might have deliver his own message by word of mouth
who bring the note then
or do it come through the post i have make inquiries say the inspector
william receive a letter by the afternoon post yesterday
the envelope be destroy by him excellent cry holmes clap the inspector on the back
you've see the postman
it be a pleasure to work with you
well here be the lodge and if you will come up colonel i will show you the scene of the crime we pass the pretty cottage where the murder man have live and walk up an oak line avenue to the fine old queen anne house which bear the date of malplaquet upon the lintel of the door
holmes and the inspector lead us round it until we come to the side gate which be separate by a stretch of garden from the hedge which line the road
a constable be stand at the kitchen door
throw the door open officer say holmes
now it be on those stairs that young mr
cunningham stand and saw the two men struggle just where we be
old mr
cunningham be at that window the second on the leave and he saw the fellow get away just to the leave of that bush
then mr
alec run out and kneel beside the wound man
the grind be very hard you see and there be no mark to guide us as he speak two men come down the garden path from round the angle of the house
the one be an elderly man with a strong deep line heavy eye face the other a dash young fellow whose bright smile expression and showy dress be in strange contrast with the business which have bring us there
still at it then say he to holmes
i think you londoners be never at fault
you don't seem to be so very quick after all ah you must give us a little time say holmes good humoredly
you'll want it say young alec cunningham
why i don't see that we have any clue at all there's only one answer the inspector
we think that if we could only find good heavens mr
holmes
what be the matter my poor friend's face have suddenly assume the most dreadful expression
his eye roll upwards his feature writhe in agony and with a suppress groan he drop on his face upon the grind
horrify at the suddenness and severity of the attack we carry him into the kitchen where he lay back in a large chair and breathe heavily for some minutes
finally with a shamefaced apology for his weakness he rise once more
watson would tell you that i have only just recover from a severe illness he explain
i be liable to these sudden nervous attack shall i send you home in my trap ask old cunningham
well since i be here there be one point on which i should like to feel sure
we can very easily verify it what be it well it seem to me that it be just possible that the arrival of this poor fellow william be not before but after the entrance of the burglar into the house
you appear to take it for grant that although the door be force the robber never get in i fancy that be quite obvious say mr
cunningham gravely
why my son alec have not yet go to bed and he would certainly have hear any one move about where be he sit i be smoke in my dress room which window be that the last on the leave next my father's both of your lamps be light of course undoubtedly there be some very singular point here say holmes smile
be it not extraordinary that a burglar and a burglar who have have some previous experience should deliberately break into a house at a time when he could see from the light that two of the family be still afoot he must have be a cool hand well of course if the case be not an odd one we should not have be drive to ask you for an explanation say young mr
alec
but as to your ideas that the man have rob the house before william tackle him i think it a most absurd notion
wouldn't we have find the place disarrange and miss the things which he have take it depend on what the things be say holmes
you must remember that we be deal with a burglar who be a very peculiar fellow and who appear to work on line of his own
look for example at the queer lot of things which he take from acton's what be it a ball of string a letter weight and i don't know what other odds and end well we be quite in your hand mr
holmes say old cunningham
anything which you or the inspector may suggest will most certainly be do in the first place say holmes i should like you to offer a reward come from yourself for the officials may take a little time before they would agree upon the sum and these things cannot be do too promptly
i have jot down the form here if you would not mind sign it
fifty pound be quite enough i think i would willingly give five hundred say the j p take the slip of paper and the pencil which holmes hand to him
this be not quite correct however he add glance over the document
i write it rather hurriedly you see you begin 'whereas at about a quarter to one on tuesday morning an attempt be make ' and so on
it be at a quarter to twelve as a matter of fact i be pain at the mistake for i know how keenly holmes would feel any slip of the kind
it be his specialty to be accurate as to fact but his recent illness have shake him and this one little incident be enough to show me that he be still far from be himself
he be obviously embarrass for an instant while the inspector raise his eyebrows and alec cunningham burst into a laugh
the old gentleman correct the mistake however and hand the paper back to holmes
get it print as soon as possible he say i think your idea be an excellent one holmes put the slip of paper carefully away into his pocket book
and now say he it really would be a good thing that we should all go over the house together and make certain that this rather erratic burglar do not after all carry anything away with him before enter holmes make an examination of the door which have be force
it be evident that a chisel or strong knife have be thrust in and the lock force back with it
we could see the mark in the wood where it have be push in
you don't use bar then he ask
we have never find it necessary you don't keep a dog yes but he be chain on the other side of the house when do the servants go to bed about ten i understand that william be usually in bed also at that hour yes it be singular that on this particular night he should have be up
now i should be very glad if you would have the kindness to show us over the house mr
cunningham a stone flag passage with the kitchens branch away from it lead by a wooden staircase directly to the first floor of the house
it come out upon the land opposite to a second more ornamental stair which come up from the front hall
out of this land open the draw room and several bedrooms include those of mr
cunningham and his son
holmes walk slowly take keen note of the architecture of the house
i could tell from his expression that he be on a hot scent and yet i could not in the least imagine in what direction his inferences be lead him
my good sir say mr
cunningham with some impatience this be surely very unnecessary
that be my room at the end of the stairs and my son's be the one beyond it
i leave it to your judgment whether it be possible for the thief to have come up here without disturb us you must try round and get on a fresh scent i fancy say the son with a rather malicious smile
still i must ask you to humour me a little further
i should like for example to see how far the windows of the bedrooms command the front
this i understand be your son's room he push open the door and that i presume be the dress room in which he sit smoke when the alarm be give
where do the window of that look out to he step across the bedroom push open the door and glance round the other chamber
i hope that you be satisfy now say mr
cunningham tartly
thank you i think i have see all that i wish then if it be really necessary we can go into my room if it be not too much trouble the j p
shrug his shoulder and lead the way into his own chamber which be a plainly furnish and commonplace room
as we move across it in the direction of the window holmes fell back until he and i be the last of the group
near the foot of the bed stand a dish of oranges and a carafe of water
as we pass it holmes to my unutterable astonishment lean over in front of me and deliberately knock the whole thing over
the glass smash into a thousand piece and the fruit roll about into every corner of the room
you've do it now watson say he coolly
a pretty mess you've make of the carpet i stoop in some confusion and begin to pick up the fruit understand for some reason my companion desire me to take the blame upon myself
the others do the same and set the table on its legs again
halloa cry the inspector where's he get to holmes have disappear
wait here an instant say young alec cunningham
the fellow be off his head in my opinion
come with me father and see where he have get to they rush out of the room leave the inspector the colonel and me star at each other
'pon my word i be incline to agree with master alec say the official
it may be the effect of this illness but it seem to me that his word be cut short by a sudden scream of help
help
murder with a thrill i recognise the voice of that of my friend
i rush madly from the room on to the land
the cry which have sink down into a hoarse inarticulate shout come from the room which we have first visit
i dash in and on into the dress room beyond
the two cunninghams be bend over the prostrate figure of sherlock holmes the younger clutch his throat with both hand while the elder seem to be twist one of his wrists
in an instant the three of us have tear them away from him and holmes stagger to his feet very pale and evidently greatly exhaust
arrest these men inspector he gasp
on what charge that of murder their coachman william kirwan the inspector star about him in bewilderment
oh come now mr
holmes say he at last i'm sure you don't really mean to tut man look at their face cry holmes curtly
never certainly have i see a plainer confession of guilt upon human countenance
the older man seem numb and daze with a heavy sullen expression upon his strongly mark face
the son on the other hand have drop all that jaunty dash style which have characterize him and the ferocity of a dangerous wild beast gleam in his dark eye and distort his handsome feature
the inspector say nothing but step to the door he blow his whistle
two of his constables come at the call
i have no alternative mr
cunningham say he
i trust that this may all prove to be an absurd mistake but you can see that ah would you
drop it he strike out with his hand and a revolver which the younger man be in the act of cock clatter down upon the floor
keep that say holmes quietly put his foot upon it you will find it useful at the trial
but this be what we really want he hold up a little crumple piece of paper
the remainder of the sheet cry the inspector
precisely and where be it where i be sure it must be
i'll make the whole matter clear to you presently
i think colonel that you and watson might return now and i will be with you again in an hour at the furthest
the inspector and i must have a word with the prisoners but you will certainly see me back at luncheon time sherlock holmes be as good as his word for about one o'clock he rejoin us in the colonel's smoke room
he be accompany by a little elderly gentleman who be introduce to me as the mr
acton whose house have be the scene of the original burglary
i wish mr
acton to be present while i demonstrate this small matter to you say holmes for it be natural that he should take a keen interest in the detail
i be afraid my dear colonel that you must regret the hour that you take in such a stormy petrel as i be on the contrary answer the colonel warmly i consider it the greatest privilege to have be permit to study your methods of work
i confess that they quite surpass my expectations and that i be utterly unable to account for your result
i have not yet see the vestige of a clue i be afraid that my explanation may disillusionize you but it have always be my habit to hide none of my methods either from my friend watson or from any one who might take an intelligent interest in them
but first as i be rather shake by the knock about which i have in the dress room i think that i shall help myself to a dash of your brandy colonel
my strength have be rather try of late i trust that you have no more of those nervous attack sherlock holmes laugh heartily
we will come to that in its turn say he
i will lay an account of the case before you in its due order show you the various point which guide me in my decision
pray interrupt me if there be any inference which be not perfectly clear to you
it be of the highest importance in the art of detection to be able to recognise out of a number of facts which be incidental and which vital
otherwise your energy and attention must be dissipate instead of be concentrate
now in this case there be not the slightest doubt in my mind from the first that the key of the whole matter must be look for in the scrap of paper in the dead man's hand
before go into this i would draw your attention to the fact that if alec cunningham's narrative be correct and if the assailant after shoot william kirwan have _instantly_ flee then it obviously could not be he who tear the paper from the dead man's hand
but if it be not he it must have be alec cunningham himself for by the time that the old man have descend several servants be upon the scene
the point be a simple one but the inspector have overlook it because he have start with the supposition that these county magnates have have nothing to do with the matter
now i make a point of never have any prejudice and of follow docilely wherever fact may lead me and so in the very first stage of the investigation i find myself look a little askance at the part which have be play by mr
alec cunningham
and now i make a very careful examination of the corner of paper which the inspector have submit to us
it be at once clear to me that it form part of a very remarkable document
here it be
do you not now observe something very suggestive about it it have a very irregular look say the colonel
my dear sir cry holmes there cannot be the least doubt in the world that it have be write by two persons do alternate word
when i draw your attention to the strong t's of 'at' and 'to' and ask you to compare them with the weak ones of 'quarter' and 'twelve ' you will instantly recognise the fact
a very brief analysis of these four word would enable you to say with the utmost confidence that the 'learn' and the 'maybe' be write in the stronger hand and the 'what' in the weaker by jove it's as clear as day cry the colonel
why on earth should two men write a letter in such a fashion obviously the business be a bad one and one of the men who distrust the other be determine that whatever be do each should have an equal hand in it
now of the two men it be clear that the one who write the 'at' and 'to' be the ringleader how do you get at that we might deduce it from the mere character of the one hand as compare with the other
but we have more assure reason than that for suppose it
if you examine this scrap with attention you will come to the conclusion that the man with the stronger hand write all his word first leave blank for the other to fill up
these blank be not always sufficient and you can see that the second man have a squeeze to fit his 'quarter' in between the 'at' and the 'to ' show that the latter be already write
the man who write all his word first be undoubtedly the man who plan the affair excellent cry mr
acton
but very superficial say holmes
we come now however to a point which be of importance
you may not be aware that the deduction of a man's age from his write be one which have be bring to considerable accuracy by experts
in normal case one can place a man in his true decade with tolerable confidence
i say normal case because ill health and physical weakness reproduce the sign of old age even when the invalid be a youth
in this case look at the bold strong hand of the one and the rather break back appearance of the other which still retain its legibility although the t's have begin to lose their cross we can say that the one be a young man and the other be advance in years without be positively decrepit excellent cry mr
acton again
there be a further point however which be subtler and of greater interest
there be something in common between these hand
they belong to men who be blood relatives
it may be most obvious to you in the greek e's but to me there be many small point which indicate the same thing
i have no doubt at all that a family mannerism can be trace in these two specimens of write
i be only of course give you the lead result now of my examination of the paper
there be twenty three other deductions which would be of more interest to experts than to you
they all tend to deepen the impression upon my mind that the cunninghams father and son have write this letter
have get so far my next step be of course to examine into the detail of the crime and to see how far they would help us
i go up to the house with the inspector and saw all that be to be see
the wind upon the dead man be as i be able to determine with absolute confidence fire from a revolver at the distance of something over four yards
there be no powder blacken on the clothe
evidently therefore alec cunningham have lie when he say that the two men be struggle when the shoot be fire
again both father and son agree as to the place where the man escape into the road
at that point however as it happen there be a broadish ditch moist at the bottom
as there be no indications of bootmarks about this ditch i be absolutely sure not only that the cunninghams have again lie but that there have never be any unknown man upon the scene at all
and now i have to consider the motive of this singular crime
to get at this i endeavour first of all to solve the reason of the original burglary at mr
acton's
i understand from something which the colonel tell us that a lawsuit have be go on between you mr
acton and the cunninghams
of course it instantly occur to me that they have break into your library with the intention of get at some document which might be of importance in the case precisely so say mr
acton
there can be no possible doubt as to their intentions
i have the clearest claim upon half of their present estate and if they could have find a single paper which fortunately be in the strong box of my solicitors they would undoubtedly have cripple our case there you be say holmes smile
it be a dangerous reckless attempt in which i seem to trace the influence of young alec
have find nothing they try to divert suspicion by make it appear to be an ordinary burglary to which end they carry off whatever they could lay their hand upon
that be all clear enough but there be much that be still obscure
what i want above all be to get the miss part of that note
i be certain that alec have tear it out of the dead man's hand and almost certain that he must have thrust it into the pocket of his dress gown
where else could he have put it
the only question be whether it be still there
it be worth an effort to find out and for that object we all go up to the house
the cunninghams join us as you doubtless remember outside the kitchen door
it be of course of the very first importance that they should not be remind of the existence of this paper otherwise they would naturally destroy it without delay
the inspector be about to tell them the importance which we attach to it when by the luckiest chance in the world i tumble down in a sort of fit and so change the conversation
good heavens cry the colonel laugh do you mean to say all our sympathy be waste and your fit an imposture speak professionally it be admirably do cry i look in amazement at this man who be forever confound me with some new phase of his astuteness
it be an art which be often useful say he
when i recover i manage by a device which have perhaps some little merit of ingenuity to get old cunningham to write the word 'twelve ' so that i might compare it with the 'twelve' upon the paper oh what an ass i have be i exclaim
i could see that you be commiserate me over my weakness say holmes laugh
i be sorry to cause you the sympathetic pain which i know that you felt
we then go upstairs together and have enter the room and see the dress gown hang up behind the door i contrive by upset a table to engage their attention for the moment and slip back to examine the pocket
i have hardly get the paper however which be as i have expect in one of them when the two cunninghams be on me and would i verily believe have murder me then and there but for your prompt and friendly aid
as it be i feel that young man's grip on my throat now and the father have twist my wrist round in the effort to get the paper out of my hand
they saw that i must know all about it you see and the sudden change from absolute security to complete despair make them perfectly desperate
i have a little talk with old cunningham afterwards as to the motive of the crime
he be tractable enough though his son be a perfect demon ready to blow out his own or anybody else's brain if he could have get to his revolver
when cunningham saw that the case against him be so strong he lose all heart and make a clean breast of everything
it seem that william have secretly follow his two master on the night when they make their raid upon mr
acton's and have thus get them into his power proceed under threats of exposure to levy blackmail upon them
mr
alec however be a dangerous man to play game of that sort with
it be a stroke of positive genius on his part to see in the burglary scare which be convulse the country side an opportunity of plausibly get rid of the man whom he fear
william be decoy up and shoot and have they only get the whole of the note and pay a little more attention to detail in the accessories it be very possible that suspicion might never have be arouse and the note i ask
sherlock holmes place the subjoin paper before us
piece of paper if you will only come round at quarter to twelve to the east gate you will learn what will very much surprise you and maybe be of the greatest service to you and also to annie morrison
but say nothing to anyone upon the matter it be very much the sort of thing that i expect say he
of course we do not yet know what the relations may have be between alec cunningham william kirwan and annie morrison
the result show that the trap be skillfully bait
i be sure that you cannot fail to be delight with the trace of heredity show in the p's and in the tail of the g's
the absence of the i dot in the old man's write be also most characteristic
watson i think our quiet rest in the country have be a distinct success and i shall certainly return much invigorate to baker street to morrow holmes have be seat for some hours in silence with his long thin back curve over a chemical vessel in which he be brew a particularly malodorous product
his head be sink upon his breast and he look from my point of view like a strange lank bird with dull grey plumage and a black top knot
so watson say he suddenly you do not propose to invest in south african securities
i give a start of astonishment
accustom as i be to holmes's curious faculties this sudden intrusion into my most intimate thoughts be utterly inexplicable
how on earth do you know that
i ask
he wheel round upon his stool with a steam test tube in his hand and a gleam of amusement in his deep set eye
now watson confess yourself utterly take aback say he
i be
i ought to make you sign a paper to that effect
why
because in five minutes you will say that it be all so absurdly simple
i be sure that i shall say nothing of the kind
you see my dear watson he prop his test tube in the rack and begin to lecture with the air of a professor address his class it be not really difficult to construct a series of inferences each dependent upon its predecessor and each simple in itself
if after do so one simply knock out all the central inferences and present one's audience with the start point and the conclusion one may produce a startle though possibly a meretricious effect
now it be not really difficult by an inspection of the groove between your leave forefinger and thumb to feel sure that you do not propose to invest your small capital in the goldfields
i see no connection
very likely not but i can quickly show you a close connection
here be the miss link of the very simple chain
you have chalk between your leave finger and thumb when you return from the club last night

you put chalk there when you play billiards to steady the cue

you never play billiards except with thurston

you tell me four weeks ago that thurston have an option on some south african property which would expire in a month and which he desire you to share with him

your cheque book be lock in my drawer and you have not ask for the key

you do not propose to invest your money in this manner
how absurdly simple
i cry
quite so
say he a little nettle
every problem become very childish when once it be explain to you
here be an unexplained one
see what you can make of that friend watson
he toss a sheet of paper upon the table and turn once more to his chemical analysis
i look with amazement at the absurd hieroglyphics upon the paper
why holmes it be a child's draw i cry
oh that's your idea
what else should it be
that be what mr
hilton cubitt of rid thorpe manor norfolk be very anxious to know
this little conundrum come by the first post and he be to follow by the next train
there's a ring at the bell watson
i should not be very much surprise if this be he
a heavy step be hear upon the stairs and an instant later there enter a tall ruddy clean shave gentleman whose clear eye and florid cheek tell of a life lead far from the fog of baker street
he seem to bring a whiff of his strong fresh brace east coast air with him as he enter
have shake hand with each of us he be about to sit down when his eye rest upon the paper with the curious mark which i have just examine and leave upon the table
well mr
holmes what do you make of these
he cry
they tell me that you be fond of queer mysteries and i don't think you can find a queerer one than that
i send the paper on ahead so that you might have time to study it before i come
it be certainly rather a curious production say holmes
at first sight it would appear to be some childish prank
it consist of a number of absurd little figure dance across the paper upon which they be draw
why should you attribute any importance to so grotesque an object
i never should mr
holmes
but my wife do
it be frighten her to death
she say nothing but i can see terror in her eye
that's why i want to sift the matter to the bottom
holmes hold up the paper so that the sunlight shine full upon it
it be a page tear from a note book
the mark be do in pencil and run in this way graphic holmes examine it for some time and then fold it carefully up he place it in his pocket book
this promise to be a most interest and unusual case say he
you give me a few particulars in your letter mr
hilton cubitt but i should be very much oblige if you would kindly go over it all again for the benefit of my friend dr
watson
i'm not much of a story teller say our visitor nervously clasp and unclasp his great strong hand
you'll just ask me anything that i don't make clear
i'll begin at the time of my marriage last year but i want to say first of all that though i'm not a rich man my people have be at ridling thorpe for a matter of five centuries and there be no better know family in the county of norfolk
last year i come up to london for the jubilee and i stop at a board house in russell square because parker the vicar of our parish be stay in it
there be an american young lady there patrick be the name elsie patrick
in some way we become friends until before my month be up i be as much in love as a man could be
we be quietly marry at a registry office and we return to norfolk a wed couple
you'll think it very mad mr
holmes that a man of a good old family should marry a wife in this fashion know nothing of her past or of her people but if you saw her and know her it would help you to understand
she be very straight about it be elsie
i can't say that she do not give me every chance of get out of it if i wish to do so
'i have have some very disagreeable associations in my life ' say she 'i wish to forget all about them
i would rather never allude to the past for it be very painful to me
if you take me hilton you will take a woman who have nothing that she need be personally ashamed of but you will have to be content with my word for it and to allow me to be silent as to all that pass up to the time when i become yours
if these condition be too hard then go back to norfolk and leave me to the lonely life in which you find me '
it be only the day before our wed that she say those very word to me
i tell her that i be content to take her on her own term and i have be as good as my word
well we have be marry now for a year and very happy we have be
but about a month ago at the end of june i saw for the first time sign of trouble
one day my wife receive a letter from america
i saw the american stamp
she turn deadly white read the letter and throw it into the fire
she make no allusion to it afterwards and i make none for a promise be a promise but she have never know an easy hour from that moment
there be always a look of fear upon her face a look as if she be wait and expect
she would do better to trust me
she would find that i be her best friend
but until she speak i can say nothing
mind you she be a truthful woman mr
holmes and whatever trouble there may have be in her past life it have be no fault of hers
i be only a simple norfolk squire but there be not a man in england who rank his family honour more highly than i do
she know it well and she know it well before she marry me
she would never bring any stain upon it of that i be sure
well now i come to the queer part of my story
about a week ago it be the tuesday of last week i find on one of the window sills a number of absurd little dance figure like these upon the paper
they be scrawl with chalk
i think that it be the stable boy who have draw them but the lad swear he know nothing about it
anyhow they have come there during the night
i have them wash out and i only mention the matter to my wife afterwards
to my surprise she take it very seriously and beg me if any more come to let her see them
none do come for a week and then yesterday morning i find this paper lie on the sun dial in the garden
i show it to elsie and down she drop in a dead faint
since then she have look like a woman in a dream half daze and with terror always lurk in her eye
it be then that i write and send the paper to you mr
holmes
it be not a thing that i could take to the police for they would have laugh at me but you will tell me what to do
i be not a rich man but if there be any danger threaten my little woman i would spend my last copper to shield her
he be a fine creature this man of the old english soil simple straight and gentle with his great earnest blue eye and broad comely face
his love for his wife and his trust in her shine in his feature
holmes have listen to his story with the utmost attention and now he sit for some time in silent think
don't you think mr
cubitt say he at last that your best plan would be to make a direct appeal to your wife and to ask her to share her secret with you
hilton cubitt shake his massive head
a promise be a promise mr
holmes
if elsie wish to tell me she would
if not it be not for me to force her confidence
but i be justify in take my own line and i will
then i will help you with all my heart
in the first place have you hear of any strangers be see in your neighbourhood
no
i presume that it be a very quiet place
any fresh face would cause comment
in the immediate neighbourhood yes
but we have several small water place not very far away
and the farmers take in lodgers
these hieroglyphics have evidently a mean
if it be a purely arbitrary one it may be impossible for us to solve it
if on the other hand it be systematic i have no doubt that we shall get to the bottom of it
but this particular sample be so short that i can do nothing and the facts which you have bring me be so indefinite that we have no basis for an investigation
i would suggest that you return to norfolk that you keep a keen look out and that you take an exact copy of any fresh dance men which may appear
it be a thousand pity that we have not a reproduction of those which be do in chalk upon the window sill
make a discreet inquiry also as to any strangers in the neighbourhood
when you have collect some fresh evidence come to me again
that be the best advice which i can give you mr
hilton cubitt
if there be any press fresh developments i shall be always ready to run down and see you in your norfolk home
the interview leave sherlock holmes very thoughtful and several time in the next few days i saw him take his slip of paper from his note book and look long and earnestly at the curious figure inscribe upon it
he make no allusion to the affair however until one afternoon a fortnight or so later
i be go out when he call me back
you have better stay here watson
why
because i have a wire from hilton cubitt this morning you remember hilton cubitt of the dance men
he be to reach liverpool street at one twenty
he may be here at any moment
i gather from his wire that there have be some new incidents of importance
we have not long to wait for our norfolk squire come straight from the station as fast as a hansom could bring him
he be look worry and depress with tire eye and a line forehead
it's get on my nerve this business mr
holmes say he as he sink like a weary man into an arm chair
it's bad enough to feel that you be surround by unseen unknown folk who have some kind of design upon you but when in addition to that you know that it be just kill your wife by inch then it become as much as flesh and blood can endure
she's wear away under it just wear away before my eye
have she say anything yet
no mr
holmes she have not
and yet there have be time when the poor girl have want to speak and yet could not quite bring herself to take the plunge
i have try to help her but i dare say i do it clumsily and scar her off from it
she have speak about my old family and our reputation in the county and our pride in our unsullied honour and i always felt it be lead to the point but somehow it turn off before we get there
but you have find out something for yourself
a good deal mr
holmes
i have several fresh dance men picture for you to examine and what be more important i have see the fellow
what the man who draw them
yes i saw him at his work
but i will tell you everything in order
when i get back after my visit to you the very first thing i saw next morning be a fresh crop of dance men
they have be draw in chalk upon the black wooden door of the tool house which stand beside the lawn in full view of the front windows
i take an exact copy and here it be
he unfold a paper and lay it upon the table
here be a copy of the hieroglyphics graphic excellent
say holmes
excellent
pray continue
when i have take the copy i rub out the mark but two mornings later a fresh inscription have appear
i have a copy of it here graphic holmes rub his hand and chuckle with delight
our material be rapidly accumulate say he
three days later a message be leave scrawl upon paper and place under a pebble upon the sun dial
here it be
the character be as you see exactly the same as the last one
after that i determine to lie in wait so i get out my revolver and i sit up in my study which overlook the lawn and garden
about two in the morning i be seat by the window all be dark save for the moonlight outside when i hear step behind me and there be my wife in her dress gown
she implore me to come to bed
i tell her frankly that i wish to see who it be who play such absurd trick upon us
she answer that it be some senseless practical joke and that i should not take any notice of it
'if it really annoy you hilton we might go and travel you and i and so avoid this nuisance '
'what be drive out of our own house by a practical joker '
say i
'why we should have the whole county laugh at us '
'well come to bed ' say she 'and we can discuss it in the morning '
suddenly as she speak i saw her white face grow whiter yet in the moonlight and her hand tighten upon my shoulder
something be move in the shadow of the tool house
i saw a dark creep figure which crawl round the corner and squat in front of the door
seize my pistol i be rush out when my wife throw her arm round me and hold me with convulsive strength
i try to throw her off but she cling to me most desperately
at last i get clear but by the time i have open the door and reach the house the creature be go
he have leave a trace of his presence however for there on the door be the very same arrangement of dance men which have already twice appear and which i have copy on that paper
there be no other sign of the fellow anywhere though i run all over the ground
and yet the amaze thing be that he must have be there all the time for when i examine the door again in the morning he have scrawl some more of his picture under the line which i have already see
have you that fresh draw
yes it be very short but i make a copy of it and here it be
again he produce a paper
the new dance be in this form graphic tell me say holmes and i could see by his eye that he be much excite be this a mere addition to the first or do it appear to be entirely separate
it be on a different panel of the door
excellent
this be far the most important of all for our purpose
it fill me with hop
now mr
hilton cubitt please continue your most interest statement
i have nothing more to say mr
holmes except that i be angry with my wife that night for have hold me back when i might have catch the skulk rascal
she say that she fear that i might come to harm
for an instant it have cross my mind that perhaps what she really fear be that he might come to harm for i could not doubt that she know who this man be and what he mean by these strange signal
but there be a tone in my wife's voice mr
holmes and a look in her eye which forbid doubt and i be sure that it be indeed my own safety that be in her mind
there's the whole case and now i want your advice as to what i ought to do
my own inclination be to put half a dozen of my farm lads in the shrubbery and when this fellow come again to give him such a hide that he will leave us in peace for the future
i fear it be too deep a case for such simple remedy say holmes
how long can you stay in london
i must go back to day
i would not leave my wife alone all night for anything
she be very nervous and beg me to come back
i dare say you be right
but if you could have stop i might possibly have be able to return with you in a day or two
meanwhile you will leave me these paper and i think that it be very likely that i shall be able to pay you a visit shortly and to throw some light upon your case
sherlock holmes preserve his calm professional manner until our visitor have leave us although it be easy for me who know him so well to see that he be profoundly excite
the moment that hilton cubitt's broad back have disappear through the door my comrade rush to the table lay out all the slip of paper contain dance men in front of him and throw himself into an intricate and elaborate calculation
for two hours i watch him as he cover sheet after sheet of paper with figure and letter so completely absorb in his task that he have evidently forget my presence
sometimes he be make progress and whistle and sing at his work sometimes he be puzzle and would sit for long spell with a furrow brow and a vacant eye
finally he spring from his chair with a cry of satisfaction and walk up and down the room rub his hand together
then he write a long telegram upon a cable form
if my answer to this be as i hope you will have a very pretty case to add to your collection watson say he
i expect that we shall be able to go down to norfolk to morrow and to take our friend some very definite news as to the secret of his annoyance
i confess that i be fill with curiosity but i be aware that holmes like to make his disclosures at his own time and in his own way so i wait until it should suit him to take me into his confidence
but there be a delay in that answer telegram and two days of impatience follow during which holmes prick up his ears at every ring of the bell
on the even of the second there come a letter from hilton cubitt
all be quiet with him save that a long inscription have appear that morning upon the pedestal of the sun dial
he inclose a copy of it which be here reproduce graphic holmes bend over this grotesque frieze for some minutes and then suddenly spring to his feet with an exclamation of surprise and dismay
his face be haggard with anxiety
we have let this affair go far enough say he
be there a train to north walsham to night
i turn up the time table
the last have just go
then we shall breakfast early and take the very first in the morning say holmes
our presence be most urgently need
ah
here be our expect cablegram
one moment mrs
hudson there may be an answer
no that be quite as i expect
this message make it even more essential that we should not lose an hour in let hilton cubitt know how matter stand for it be a singular and a dangerous web in which our simple norfolk squire be entangle
so indeed it prove and as i come to the dark conclusion of a story which have seem to me to be only childish and bizarre i experience once again the dismay and horror with which i be fill
would that i have some brighter end to communicate to my readers but these be the chronicle of fact and i must follow to their dark crisis the strange chain of events which for some days make ridling thorpe manor a household word through the length and breadth of england
we have hardly alight at north walsham and mention the name of our destination when the station master hurry towards us
i suppose that you be the detectives from london
say he
a look of annoyance pass over holmes's face
what make you think such a thing
because inspector martin from norwich have just pass through
but maybe you be the surgeons
she's not dead or wasn't by last account
you may be in time to save her yet though it be for the gallows
holmes's brow be dark with anxiety
we be go to ridling thorpe manor say he but we have hear nothing of what have pass there
it's a terrible business say the station master
they be shoot both mr
hilton cubitt and his wife
she shoot him and then herself so the servants say
he's dead and her life be despair of
dear dear one of the oldest families in the county of norfolk and one of the most honour
without a word holmes hurry to a carriage and during the long seven miles' drive he never open his mouth
seldom have i see him so utterly despondent
he have be uneasy during all our journey from town and i have observe that he have turn over the morning paper with anxious attention but now this sudden realization of his worst fear leave him in a blank melancholy
he lean back in his seat lose in gloomy speculation
yet there be much around to interest us for we be pass through as singular a country side as any in england where a few scatter cottages represent the population of to day while on every hand enormous square tower church bristle up from the flat green landscape and tell of the glory and prosperity of old east anglia
at last the violet rim of the german ocean appear over the green edge of the norfolk coast and the driver point with his whip to two old brick and timber gables which project from a grove of tree
that's ridling thorpe manor say he
as we drive up to the porticoed front door i observe in front of it beside the tennis lawn the black tool house and the pedestalled sun dial with which we have such strange associations
a dapper little man with a quick alert manner and a wax moustache have just descend from a high dog cart
he introduce himself as inspector martin of the norfolk constabulary and he be considerably astonish when he hear the name of my companion
why mr
holmes the crime be only commit at three this morning
how could you hear of it in london and get to the spot as soon as i
i anticipate it
i come in the hope of prevent it
then you must have important evidence of which we be ignorant for they be say to be a most unite couple
i have only the evidence of the dance men say holmes
i will explain the matter to you later
meanwhile since it be too late to prevent this tragedy i be very anxious that i should use the knowledge which i possess in order to ensure that justice be do
will you associate me in your investigation or will you prefer that i should act independently
i should be proud to feel that we be act together mr
holmes say the inspector earnestly
in that case i should be glad to hear the evidence and to examine the premise without an instant of unnecessary delay
inspector martin have the good sense to allow my friend to do things in his own fashion and content himself with carefully note the result
the local surgeon an old white haired man have just come down from mrs
hilton cubitt's room and he report that her injuries be serious but not necessarily fatal
the bullet have pass through the front of her brain and it would probably be some time before she could regain consciousness
on the question of whether she have be shoot or have shoot herself he would not venture to express any decide opinion
certainly the bullet have be discharge at very close quarter
there be only the one pistol find in the room two barrel of which have be empty
mr
hilton cubitt have be shoot through the heart
it be equally conceivable that he have shoot her and then himself or that she have be the criminal for the revolver lay upon the floor midway between them
have he be move
ask holmes
we have move nothing except the lady
we could not leave her lie wound upon the floor
how long have you be here doctor
since four o'clock
anyone else
yes the constable here
and you have touch nothing
nothing
you have act with great discretion
who send for you
the housemaid saunders
be it she who give the alarm
she and mrs
king the cook
where be they now
in the kitchen i believe
then i think we have better hear their story at once
the old hall oak panel and high windowed have be turn into a court of investigation
holmes sit in a great old fashion chair his inexorable eye gleam out of his haggard face
i could read in them a set purpose to devote his life to this quest until the client whom he have fail to save should at last be avenge
the trim inspector martin the old grey head country doctor myself and a stolid village policeman make up the rest of that strange company
the two women tell their story clearly enough
they have be arouse from their sleep by the sound of an explosion which have be follow a minute later by a second one
they sleep in adjoin room and mrs
king have rush in to saunders
together they have descend the stairs
the door of the study be open and a candle be burn upon the table
their master lay upon his face in the centre of the room
he be quite dead
near the window his wife be crouch her head lean against the wall
she be horribly wound and the side of her face be red with blood
she breathe heavily but be incapable of say anything
the passage as well as the room be full of smoke and the smell of powder
the window be certainly shut and fasten upon the inside
both women be positive upon the point
they have at once send for the doctor and for the constable
then with the aid of the groom and the stable boy they have convey their injure mistress to her room
both she and her husband have occupy the bed
she be clothe in her dress he in his dress gown over his night clothe
nothing have be move in the study
so far as they know there have never be any quarrel between husband and wife
they have always look upon them as a very unite couple
these be the main point of the servants' evidence
in answer to inspector martin they be clear that every door be fasten upon the inside and that no one could have escape from the house
in answer to holmes they both remember that they be conscious of the smell of powder from the moment that they run out of their room upon the top floor
i commend that fact very carefully to your attention say holmes to his professional colleague
and now i think that we be in a position to undertake a thorough examination of the room
the study prove to be a small chamber line on three side with book and with a write table face an ordinary window which look out upon the garden
our first attention be give to the body of the unfortunate squire whose huge frame lay stretch across the room
his disorder dress show that he have be hastily arouse from sleep
the bullet have be fire at him from the front and have remain in his body after penetrate the heart
his death have certainly be instantaneous and painless
there be no powder mark either upon his dress gown or on his hand
accord to the country surgeon the lady have stain upon her face but none upon her hand
the absence of the latter mean nothing though its presence may mean everything say holmes
unless the powder from a badly fit cartridge happen to spurt backwards one may fire many shots without leave a sign
i would suggest that mr
cubitt's body may now be remove
i suppose doctor you have not recover the bullet which wound the lady
a serious operation will be necessary before that can be do
but there be still four cartridges in the revolver
two have be fire and two wound inflict so that each bullet can be account for
so it would seem say holmes
perhaps you can account also for the bullet which have so obviously strike the edge of the window
he have turn suddenly and his long thin finger be point to a hole which have be drill right through the lower window sash about an inch above the bottom
by george
cry the inspector
how ever do you see that
because i look for it
wonderful
say the country doctor
you be certainly right sir
then a third shoot have be fire and therefore a third person must have be present
but who could that have be and how could he have get away
that be the problem which we be now about to solve say sherlock holmes
you remember inspector martin when the servants say that on leave their room they be at once conscious of a smell of powder i remark that the point be an extremely important one
yes sir but i confess i do not quite follow you
it suggest that at the time of the fire the window as well as the door of the room have be open
otherwise the fume of powder could not have be blow so rapidly through the house
a draught in the room be necessary for that
both door and window be only open for a very short time however
how do you prove that
because the candle have not gutter
capital
cry the inspector
capital
feel sure that the window have be open at the time of the tragedy i conceive that there might have be a third person in the affair who stand outside this open and fire through it
any shoot direct at this person might hit the sash
i look and there sure enough be the bullet mark
but how come the window to be shut and fasten
the woman's first instinct would be to shut and fasten the window
but halloa
what be this
it be a lady's hand bag which stand upon the study table a trim little hand bag of crocodile skin and silver
holmes open it and turn the content out
there be twenty fifty pound note of the bank of england hold together by an india rubber band nothing else
this must be preserve for it will figure in the trial say holmes as he hand the bag with its content to the inspector
it be now necessary that we should try to throw some light upon this third bullet which have clearly from the splinter of the wood be fire from inside the room
i should like to see mrs
king the cook again
you say mrs
king that you be awaken by a loud explosion
when you say that do you mean that it seem to you to be louder than the second one
well sir it waken me from my sleep and so it be hard to judge
but it do seem very loud
you don't think that it might have be two shots fire almost at the same instant
i be sure i couldn't say sir
i believe that it be undoubtedly so
i rather think inspector martin that we have now exhaust all that this room can teach us
if you will kindly step round with me we shall see what fresh evidence the garden have to offer
a flower bed extend up to the study window and we all break into an exclamation as we approach it
the flower be trample down and the soft soil be imprint all over with footmarks
large masculine feet they be with peculiarly long sharp toe
holmes hunt about among the grass and leave like a retriever after a wound bird
then with a cry of satisfaction he bend forward and pick up a little brazen cylinder
i think so say he the revolver have an ejector and here be the third cartridge
i really think inspector martin that our case be almost complete
the country inspector's face have show his intense amazement at the rapid and masterful progress of holmes's investigation
at first he have show some disposition to assert his own position but now he be overcome with admiration and ready to follow without question wherever holmes lead
whom do you suspect
he ask
i'll go into that later
there be several point in this problem which i have not be able to explain to you yet
now that i have get so far i have best proceed on my own line and then clear the whole matter up once and for all
just as you wish mr
holmes so long as we get our man
i have no desire to make mysteries but it be impossible at the moment of action to enter into long and complex explanations
i have the thread of this affair all in my hand
even if this lady should never recover consciousness we can still reconstruct the events of last night and ensure that justice be do
first of all i wish to know whether there be any inn in this neighbourhood know as 'elrige's'
the servants be cross question but none of them have hear of such a place
the stable boy throw a light upon the matter by remember that a farmer of that name live some miles off in the direction of east ruston
be it a lonely farm
very lonely sir
perhaps they have not hear yet of all that happen here during the night
maybe not sir
holmes think for a little and then a curious smile play over his face
saddle a horse my lad say he
i shall wish you to take a note to elrige's farm
he take from his pocket the various slip of the dance men
with these in front of him he work for some time at the study table
finally he hand a note to the boy with directions to put it into the hand of the person to whom it be address and especially to answer no question of any sort which might be put to him
i saw the outside of the note address in straggle irregular character very unlike holmes's usual precise hand
it be consign to mr
abe slaney elrige's farm east ruston norfolk
i think inspector holmes remark that you would do well to telegraph for an escort as if my calculations prove to be correct you may have a particularly dangerous prisoner to convey to the county gaol
the boy who take this note could no doubt forward your telegram
if there be an afternoon train to town watson i think we should do well to take it as i have a chemical analysis of some interest to finish and this investigation draw rapidly to a close
when the youth have be dispatch with the note sherlock holmes give his instructions to the servants
if any visitor be to call ask for mrs
hilton cubitt no information should be give as to her condition but he be to be show at once into the draw room
he impress these point upon them with the utmost earnestness
finally he lead the way into the draw room with the remark that the business be now out of our hand and that we must while away the time as best we might until we could see what be in store for us
the doctor have depart to his patients and only the inspector and myself remain
i think that i can help you to pass an hour in an interest and profitable manner say holmes draw his chair up to the table and spread out in front of him the various paper upon which be record the antic of the dance men
as to you friend watson i owe you every atonement for have allow your natural curiosity to remain so long unsatisfied
to you inspector the whole incident may appeal as a remarkable professional study
i must tell you first of all the interest circumstances connect with the previous consultations which mr
hilton cubitt have have with me in baker street
he then shortly recapitulate the facts which have already be record
i have here in front of me these singular productions at which one might smile have they not prove themselves to be the fore runners of so terrible a tragedy
i be fairly familiar with all form of secret write and be myself the author of a trifle monograph upon the subject in which i analyze one hundred and sixty separate cipher but i confess that this be entirely new to me
the object of those who invent the system have apparently be to conceal that these character convey a message and to give the idea that they be the mere random sketch of children
have once recognise however that the symbols stand for letter and have apply the rule which guide us in all form of secret write the solution be easy enough
the first message submit to me be so short that it be impossible for me to do more than to say with some confidence that the symbol xxx stand for e as you be aware e be the most common letter in the english alphabet and it predominate to so mark an extent that even in a short sentence one would expect to find it most often
out of fifteen symbols in the first message four be the same so it be reasonable to set this down as e it be true that in some case the figure be bear a flag and in some case not but it be probable from the way in which the flag be distribute that they be use to break the sentence up into word
i accept this as a hypothesis and note that e be represent by xxx
but now come the real difficulty of the inquiry
the order of the english letter after e be by no mean well mark and any preponderance which may be show in an average of a print sheet may be reverse in a single short sentence
speak roughly t a o i n s h r d and l be the numerical order in which letter occur but t a o and i be very nearly abreast of each other and it would be an endless task to try each combination until a mean be arrive at
i therefore wait for fresh material
in my second interview with mr
hilton cubitt he be able to give me two other short sentence and one message which appear since there be no flag to be a single word
here be the symbols
now in the single word i have already get the two e's come second and fourth in a word of five letter
it might be 'sever ' or 'lever ' or 'never '
there can be no question that the latter as a reply to an appeal be far the most probable and the circumstances point to its be a reply write by the lady
accept it as correct we be now able to say that the symbols xxx stand respectively for n v and r
even now i be in considerable difficulty but a happy think put me in possession of several other letter
it occur to me that if these appeal come as i expect from someone who have be intimate with the lady in her early life a combination which contain two e's with three letter between might very well stand for the name 'elsie '
on examination i find that such a combination form the termination of the message which be three time repeat
it be certainly some appeal to 'elsie '
in this way i have get my l s and i but what appeal could it be
there be only four letter in the word which precede 'elsie ' and it end in e surely the word must be 'come '
i try all other four letter end in e but could find none to fit the case
so now i be in possession of c o and m and i be in a position to attack the first message once more divide it into word and put dot for each symbol which be still unknown
so treat it work out in this fashion m ere e sl ne
now the first letter can only be a which be a most useful discovery since it occur no fewer than three time in this short sentence and the h be also apparent in the second word
now it become be here a e slane
or fill in the obvious vacancies in the name be here abe slaney
i have so many letter now that i could proceed with considerable confidence to the second message which work out in this fashion a elri es
here i could only make sense by put t and g for the miss letter and suppose that the name be that of some house or inn at which the writer be stay
inspector martin and i have listen with the utmost interest to the full and clear account of how my friend have produce result which have lead to so complete a command over our difficulties
what do you do then sir
ask the inspector
i have every reason to suppose that this abe slaney be an american since abe be an american contraction and since a letter from america have be the start point of all the trouble
i have also every cause to think that there be some criminal secret in the matter
the lady's allusions to her past and her refusal to take her husband into her confidence both point in that direction
i therefore cable to my friend wilson hargreave of the new york police bureau who have more than once make use of my knowledge of london crime
i ask him whether the name of abe slaney be know to him
here be his reply 'the most dangerous crook in chicago '
on the very even upon which i have his answer hilton cubitt send me the last message from slaney
work with know letter it take this form elsie re be to meet thy go
the addition of a p and a d complete a message which show me that the rascal be proceed from persuasion to threats and my knowledge of the crook of chicago prepare me to find that he might very rapidly put his word into action
i at once come to norfolk with my friend and colleague dr
watson but unhappily only in time to find that the worst have already occur
it be a privilege to be associate with you in the handle of a case say the inspector warmly
you will excuse me however if i speak frankly to you
you be only answerable to yourself but i have to answer to my superiors
if this abe slaney live at elrige's be indeed the murderer and if he have make his escape while i be seat here i should certainly get into serious trouble
you need not be uneasy
he will not try to escape
how do you know
to fly would be a confession of guilt
then let us go to arrest him
i expect him here every instant
but why should he come
because i have write and ask him
but this be incredible mr
holmes
why should he come because you have ask him
would not such a request rather rouse his suspicions and cause him to fly
i think i have know how to frame the letter say sherlock holmes
in fact if i be not very much mistake here be the gentleman himself come up the drive
a man be stride up the path which lead to the door
he be a tall handsome swarthy fellow clothe in a suit of grey flannel with a panama hat a bristle black beard and a great aggressive hook nose and flourish a cane as he walk
he swagger up the path as if the place belong to him and we hear his loud confident peal at the bell
i think gentlemen say holmes quietly that we have best take up our position behind the door
every precaution be necessary when deal with such a fellow
you will need your handcuff inspector
you can leave the talk to me
we wait in silence for a minute one of those minutes which one can never forget
then the door open and the man step in
in an instant holmes clap a pistol to his head and martin slip the handcuff over his wrists
it be all do so swiftly and deftly that the fellow be helpless before he know that he be attack
he glare from one to the other of us with a pair of blaze black eye
then he burst into a bitter laugh
well gentlemen you have the drop on me this time
i seem to have knock up against something hard
but i come here in answer to a letter from mrs
hilton cubitt
don't tell me that she be in this
don't tell me that she help to set a trap for me
mrs
hilton cubitt be seriously injure and be at death's door
the man give a hoarse cry of grief which ring through the house
you're crazy
he cry fiercely
it be he that be hurt not she
who would have hurt little elsie
i may have threaten her god forgive me but i would not have touch a hair of her pretty head
take it back you
say that she be not hurt
she be find badly wound by the side of her dead husband
he sink with a deep groan on to the settee and bury his face in his manacle hand
for five minutes he be silent
then he raise his face once more and speak with the cold composure of despair
i have nothing to hide from you gentlemen say he
if i shoot the man he have his shoot at me and there's no murder in that
but if you think i could have hurt that woman then you don't know either me or her
i tell you there be never a man in this world love a woman more than i love her
i have a right to her
she be pledge to me years ago
who be this englishman that he should come between us
i tell you that i have the first right to her and that i be only claim my own
she break away from your influence when she find the man that you be say holmes sternly
she flee from america to avoid you and she marry an honourable gentleman in england
you dog her and follow her and make her life a misery to her in order to induce her to abandon the husband whom she love and respect in order to fly with you whom she fear and hat
you have end by bring about the death of a noble man and drive his wife to suicide
that be your record in this business mr
abe slaney and you will answer for it to the law
if elsie die i care nothing what become of me say the american
he open one of his hand and look at a note crumple up in his palm
see here mister he cry with a gleam of suspicion in his eye you're not try to scare me over this be you
if the lady be hurt as bad as you say who be it that write this note
he toss it forward on to the table
i write it to bring you here
you write it
there be no one on earth outside the joint who know the secret of the dance men
how come you to write it
what one man can invent another can discover say holmes
there be a cab come to convey you to norwich mr
slaney
but meanwhile you have time to make some small reparation for the injury you have work
be you aware that mrs
hilton cubitt have herself lie under grave suspicion of the murder of her husband and that it be only my presence here and the knowledge which i happen to possess which have save her from the accusation
the least that you owe her be to make it clear to the whole world that she be in no way directly or indirectly responsible for his tragic end
i ask nothing better say the american
i guess the very best case i can make for myself be the absolute naked truth
it be my duty to warn you that it will be use against you cry the inspector with the magnificent fair play of the british criminal law
slaney shrug his shoulder
i'll chance that say he
first of all i want you gentlemen to understand that i have know this lady since she be a child
there be seven of us in a gang in chicago and elsie's father be the boss of the joint
he be a clever man be old patrick
it be he who invent that write which would pass as a child's scrawl unless you just happen to have the key to it
well elsie learn some of our ways but she couldn't stand the business and she have a bite of honest money of her own so she give us all the slip and get away to london
she have be engage to me and she would have marry me i believe if i have take over another profession but she would have nothing to do with anything on the cross
it be only after her marriage to this englishman that i be able to find out where she be
i write to her but get no answer
after that i come over and as letter be no use i put my message where she could read them
well i have be here a month now
i live in that farm where i have a room down below and could get in and out every night and no one the wiser
i try all i could to coax elsie away
i know that she read the message for once she write an answer under one of them
then my temper get the better of me and i begin to threaten her
she send me a letter then implore me to go away and say that it would break her heart if any scandal should come upon her husband
she say that she would come down when her husband be asleep at three in the morning and speak with me through the end window if i would go away afterwards and leave her in peace
she come down and bring money with her try to bribe me to go
this make me mad and i catch her arm and try to pull her through the window
at that moment in rush the husband with his revolver in his hand
elsie have sink down upon the floor and we be face to face
i be heel also and i hold up my gun to scare him off and let me get away
he fire and miss me
i pull off almost at the same instant and down he drop
i make away across the garden and as i go i hear the window shut behind me
that's god's truth gentlemen every word of it and i hear no more about it until that lad come rid up with a note which make me walk in here like a jay and give myself into your hand
a cab have drive up whilst the american have be talk
two uniform policemen sit inside
inspector martin rise and touch his prisoner on the shoulder
it be time for us to go
can i see her first
no she be not conscious
mr
sherlock holmes i only hope that if ever again i have an important case i shall have the good fortune to have you by my side
we stand at the window and watch the cab drive away
as i turn back my eye catch the pellet of paper which the prisoner have toss upon the table
it be the note with which holmes have decoy him
see if you can read it watson say he with a smile
it contain no word but this little line of dance men graphic if you use the code which i have explain say holmes you will find that it simply mean 'come here at once '
i be convince that it be an invitation which he would not refuse since he could never imagine that it could come from anyone but the lady
and so my dear watson we have end by turn the dance men to good when they have so often be the agents of evil and i think that i have fulfil my promise of give you something unusual for your note book
three forty be our train and i fancy we should be back in baker street for dinner
only one word of epilogue
the american abe slaney be condemn to death at the winter assizes at norwich but his penalty be change to penal servitude in consideration of mitigate circumstances and the certainty that hilton cubitt have fire the first shoot
of mrs
hilton cubitt i only know that i have hear she recover entirely and that she still remain a widow devote her whole life to the care of the poor and to the administration of her husband's estate
i have intend the adventure of the abbey grange to be the last of those exploit of my friend mr
sherlock holmes which i should ever communicate to the public
this resolution of mine be not due to any lack of material since i have note of many hundreds of case to which i have never allude nor be it cause by any wan interest on the part of my readers in the singular personality and unique methods of this remarkable man
the real reason lay in the reluctance which mr
holmes have show to the continue publication of his experience
so long as he be in actual professional practice the record of his successes be of some practical value to him but since he have definitely retire from london and betaken himself to study and bee farm on the sussex down notoriety have become hateful to him and he have peremptorily request that his wish in this matter should be strictly observe
it be only upon my represent to him that i have give a promise that the adventure of the second stain should be publish when the time be ripe and point out to him that it be only appropriate that this long series of episodes should culminate in the most important international case which he have ever be call upon to handle that i at last succeed in obtain his consent that a carefully guard account of the incident should at last be lay before the public
if in tell the story i seem to be somewhat vague in certain detail the public will readily understand that there be an excellent reason for my reticence
it be then in a year and even in a decade that shall be nameless that upon one tuesday morning in autumn we find two visitors of european fame within the wall of our humble room in baker street
the one austere high nose eagle eye and dominant be none other than the illustrious lord bellinger twice premier of britain
the other dark clear cut and elegant hardly yet of middle age and endow with every beauty of body and of mind be the right honourable trelawney hope secretary for european affairs and the most rise statesman in the country
they sit side by side upon our paper litter settee and it be easy to see from their wear and anxious face that it be business of the most press importance which have bring them
the premier's thin blue vein hand be clasp tightly over the ivory head of his umbrella and his gaunt ascetic face look gloomily from holmes to me
the european secretary pull nervously at his moustache and fidget with the seal of his watch chain
when i discover my loss mr
holmes which be at eight o'clock this morning i at once inform the prime minister
it be at his suggestion that we have both come to you
have you inform the police
no sir say the prime minister with the quick decisive manner for which he be famous
we have not do so nor be it possible that we should do so
to inform the police must in the long run mean to inform the public
this be what we particularly desire to avoid
and why sir
because the document in question be of such immense importance that its publication might very easily i might almost say probably lead to european complications of the utmost moment
it be not too much to say that peace or war may hang upon the issue
unless its recovery can be attend with the utmost secrecy then it may as well not be recover at all for all that be aim at by those who have take it be that its content should be generally know
i understand
now mr
trelawney hope i should be much oblige if you would tell me exactly the circumstances under which this document disappear
that can be do in a very few word mr
holmes
the letter for it be a letter from a foreign potentate be receive six days ago
it be of such importance that i have never leave it in my safe but i have take it across each even to my house in whitehall terrace and keep it in my bedroom in a lock despatch box
it be there last night
of that i be certain
i actually open the box while i be dress for dinner and saw the document inside
this morning it be go
the despatch box have stand beside the glass upon my dress table all night
i be a light sleeper and so be my wife
we be both prepare to swear that no one could have enter the room during the night
and yet i repeat that the paper be go
what time do you dine
half past seven
how long be it before you go to bed
my wife have go to the theatre
i wait up for her
it be half past eleven before we go to our room
then for four hours the despatch box have lie unguarded
no one be ever permit to enter that room save the housemaid in the morning and my valet or my wife's maid during the rest of the day
they be both trusty servants who have be with us for some time
besides neither of them could possibly have know that there be anything more valuable than the ordinary departmental paper in my despatch box
who do know of the existence of that letter
no one in the house
surely your wife know
no sir i have say nothing to my wife until i miss the paper this morning
the premier nod approvingly
i have long know sir how high be your sense of public duty say he
i be convince that in the case of a secret of this importance it would rise superior to the most intimate domestic tie
the european secretary bow
you do me no more than justice sir
until this morning i have never breathe one word to my wife upon this matter
could she have guess
no mr
holmes she could not have guess nor could anyone have guess
have you lose any document before
no sir
who be there in england who do know of the existence of this letter
each member of the cabinet be inform of it yesterday but the pledge of secrecy which attend every cabinet meet be increase by the solemn warn which be give by the prime minister
good heavens to think that within a few hours i should myself have lose it
his handsome face be distort with a spasm of despair and his hand tear at his hair
for a moment we catch a glimpse of the natural man impulsive ardent keenly sensitive
the next the aristocratic mask be replace and the gentle voice have return
besides the members of the cabinet there be two or possibly three departmental officials who know of the letter
no one else in england mr
holmes i assure you
but abroad
i believe that no one abroad have see it save the man who write it
i be well convince that his minister that the usual official channel have not be employ
holmes consider for some little time
now sir i must ask you more particularly what this document be and why its disappearance should have such momentous consequences
the two statesmen exchange a quick glance and the premier's shaggy eyebrows gather in a frown
mr
holmes the envelope be a long thin one of pale blue colour
there be a seal of red wax stamp with a crouch lion
it be address in large bold handwrite to i fear sir say holmes that interest and indeed essential as these detail be my inquiries must go more to the root of things
what be the letter
that be a state secret of the utmost importance and i fear that i cannot tell you nor do i see that it be necessary
if by the aid of the power which you be say to possess you can find such an envelope as i describe with its enclosure you will have deserve well of your country and earn any reward which it lie in our power to bestow
sherlock holmes rise with a smile
you be two of the most busy men in the country say he and in my own small way i have also a good many call upon me
i regret exceedingly that i cannot help you in this matter and any continuation of this interview would be a waste of time
the premier spring to his feet with that quick fierce gleam of his deep set eye before which a cabinet have cower
i be not accustom sir he begin but master his anger and resume his seat
for a minute or more we all sit in silence
then the old statesman shrug his shoulder
we must accept your term mr
holmes
no doubt you be right and it be unreasonable for us to expect you to act unless we give you our entire confidence
i agree with you sir say the younger statesman
then i will tell you rely entirely upon your honour and that of your colleague dr
watson
i may appeal to your patriotism also for i could not imagine a greater misfortune for the country than that this affair should come out
you may safely trust us
the letter then be from a certain foreign potentate who have be ruffle by some recent colonial developments of this country
it have be write hurriedly and upon his own responsibility entirely
inquiries have show that his minister know nothing of the matter
at the same time it be couch in so unfortunate a manner and certain phrase in it be of so provocative a character that its publication would undoubtedly lead to a most dangerous state of feel in this country
there would be such a ferment sir that i do not hesitate to say that within a week of the publication of that letter this country would be involve in a great war
holmes write a name upon a slip of paper and hand it to the premier
exactly
it be he
and it be this letter this letter which may well mean the expenditure of a thousand millions and the live of a hundred thousand men which have become lose in this unaccountable fashion
have you inform the sender
yes sir a cipher telegram have be despatch
perhaps he desire the publication of the letter
no sir we have strong reason to believe that he already understand that he have act in an indiscreet and hot head manner
it would be a greater blow to him and to his country than to us if this letter be to come out
if this be so whose interest be it that the letter should come out
why should anyone desire to steal it or to publish it
there mr
holmes you take me into regions of high international politics
but if you consider the european situation you will have no difficulty in perceive the motive
the whole of europe be an arm camp
there be a double league which make a fair balance of military power
great britain hold the scale
if britain be drive into war with one confederacy it would assure the supremacy of the other confederacy whether they join in the war or not
do you follow
very clearly
it be then the interest of the enemies of this potentate to secure and publish this letter so as to make a breach between his country and ours
yes sir
and to whom would this document be send if it fell into the hand of an enemy
to any of the great chancelleries of europe
it be probably speed on its way thither at the present instant as fast as steam can take it
mr
trelawney hope drop his head on his chest and groan aloud
the premier place his hand kindly upon his shoulder
it be your misfortune my dear fellow
no one can blame you
there be no precaution which you have neglect
now mr
holmes you be in full possession of the facts
what course do you recommend
holmes shake his head mournfully
you think sir that unless this document be recover there will be war
i think it be very probable
then sir prepare for war
that be a hard say mr
holmes
consider the facts sir
it be inconceivable that it be take after eleven thirty at night since i understand that mr
hope and his wife be both in the room from that hour until the loss be find out
it be take then yesterday even between seven thirty and eleven thirty probably near the earlier hour since whoever take it evidently know that it be there and would naturally secure it as early as possible
now sir if a document of this importance be take at that hour where can it be now
no one have any reason to retain it
it have be pass rapidly on to those who need it
what chance have we now to overtake or even to trace it
it be beyond our reach
the prime minister rise from the settee
what you say be perfectly logical mr
holmes
i feel that the matter be indeed out of our hand
let us presume for argument's sake that the document be take by the maid or by the valet they be both old and try servants
i understand you to say that your room be on the second floor that there be no entrance from without and that from within no one could go up unobserved
it must then be somebody in the house who have take it
to whom would the thief take it
to one of several international spy and secret agents whose name be tolerably familiar to me
there be three who may be say to be the head of their profession
i will begin my research by go round and find if each of them be at his post
if one be miss especially if he have disappear since last night we will have some indication as to where the document have go
why should he be miss
ask the european secretary
he would take the letter to an embassy in london as likely as not
i fancy not
these agents work independently and their relations with the embassies be often strain
the prime minister nod his acquiescence
i believe you be right mr
holmes
he would take so valuable a prize to head quarter with his own hand
i think that your course of action be an excellent one
meanwhile hope we cannot neglect all our other duties on account of this one misfortune
should there be any fresh developments during the day we shall communicate with you and you will no doubt let us know the result of your own inquiries
the two statesmen bow and walk gravely from the room
when our illustrious visitors have depart holmes light his pipe in silence and sit for some time lose in the deepest think
i have open the morning paper and be immerse in a sensational crime which have occur in london the night before when my friend give an exclamation spring to his feet and lay his pipe down upon the mantelpiece
yes say he there be no better way of approach it
the situation be desperate but not hopeless
even now if we could be sure which of them have take it it be just possible that it have not yet pass out of his hand
after all it be a question of money with these fellows and i have the british treasury behind me
if it's on the market i'll buy it if it mean another penny on the income tax
it be conceivable that the fellow might hold it back to see what bid come from this side before he try his luck on the other
there be only those three capable of play so bold a game there be oberstein la rothiere and eduardo lucas
i will see each of them
i glance at my morning paper
be that eduardo lucas of godolphin street
yes
you will not see him
why not
he be murder in his house last night
my friend have so often astonish me in the course of our adventure that it be with a sense of exultation that i realize how completely i have astonish him
he star in amazement and then snatch the paper from my hand
this be the paragraph which i have be engage in read when he rise from his chair murder in westminster
a crime of mysterious character be commit last night at godolphin street one of the old fashion and seclude row of eighteenth century house which lie between the river and the abbey almost in the shadow of the great tower of the house of parliament
this small but select mansion have be inhabit for some years by mr
eduardo lucas well know in society circle both on account of his charm personality and because he have the well deserve reputation of be one of the best amateur tenors in the country
mr
lucas be an unmarried man thirty four years of age and his establishment consist of mrs
pringle an elderly housekeeper and of mitton his valet
the former retire early and sleep at the top of the house
the valet be out for the even visit a friend at hammersmith
from ten o'clock onwards mr
lucas have the house to himself
what occur during that time have not yet transpire but at a quarter to twelve police constable barrett pass along godolphin street observe that the door of no
be ajar
he knock but receive no answer
perceive a light in the front room he advance into the passage and again knock but without reply
he then push open the door and enter
the room be in a state of wild disorder the furniture be all sweep to one side and one chair lie on its back in the centre
beside this chair and still grasp one of its legs lay the unfortunate tenant of the house
he have be stab to the heart and must have die instantly
the knife with which the crime have be commit be a curve indian dagger pluck down from a trophy of oriental arm which adorn one of the wall
robbery do not appear to have be the motive of the crime for there have be no attempt to remove the valuable content of the room
mr
eduardo lucas be so well know and popular that his violent and mysterious fate will arouse painful interest and intense sympathy in a wide spread circle of friends
well watson what do you make of this
ask holmes after a long pause
it be an amaze coincidence
a coincidence
here be one of the three men whom we have name as possible actors in this drama and he meet a violent death during the very hours when we know that that drama be be enact
the odds be enormous against its be coincidence
no figure could express them
no my dear watson the two events be connect must be connect
it be for us to find the connection
but now the official police must know all
not at all
they know all they see at godolphin street
they know and shall know nothing of whitehall terrace
only we know of both events and can trace the relation between them
there be one obvious point which would in any case have turn my suspicions against lucas
godolphin street westminster be only a few minutes' walk from whitehall terrace
the other secret agents whom i have name live in the extreme west end
it be easier therefore for lucas than for the others to establish a connection or receive a message from the european secretary's household a small thing and yet where events be compress into a few hours it may prove essential
halloa
what have we here
mrs
hudson have appear with a lady's card upon her salver
holmes glance at it raise his eyebrows and hand it over to me
ask lady hilda trelawney hope if she will be kind enough to step up say he
a moment later our modest apartment already so distinguish that morning be further honour by the entrance of the most lovely woman in london
i have often hear of the beauty of the youngest daughter of the duke of belminster but no description of it and no contemplation of colourless photograph have prepare me for the subtle delicate charm and the beautiful colour of that exquisite head
and yet as we saw it that autumn morning it be not its beauty which would be the first thing to impress the observer
the cheek be lovely but it be pal with emotion the eye be bright but it be the brightness of fever the sensitive mouth be tight and draw in an effort after self command
terror not beauty be what spring first to the eye as our fair visitor stand frame for an instant in the open door
have my husband be here mr
holmes
yes madam he have be here
mr
holmes i implore you not to tell him that i come here
holmes bow coldly and motion the lady to a chair
your ladyship place me in a very delicate position
i beg that you will sit down and tell me what you desire but i fear that i cannot make any unconditional promise
she sweep across the room and seat herself with her back to the window
it be a queenly presence tall graceful and intensely womanly
mr
holmes she say and her white gloved hand clasp and unclasp as she speak i will speak frankly to you in the hope that it may induce you to speak frankly in return
there be complete confidence between my husband and me on all matter save one
that one be politics
on this his lips be seal
he tell me nothing
now i be aware that there be a most deplorable occurrence in our house last night
i know that a paper have disappear
but because the matter be political my husband refuse to take me into his complete confidence
now it be essential essential i say that i should thoroughly understand it
you be the only other person save only these politicians who know the true facts
i beg you then mr
holmes to tell me exactly what have happen and what it will lead to
tell me all mr
holmes
let no regard for your client's interest keep you silent for i assure you that his interest if he would only see it would be best serve by take me into his complete confidence
what be this paper which be steal
madam what you ask me be really impossible
she groan and sink her face in her hand
you must see that this be so madam
if your husband think fit to keep you in the dark over this matter be it for me who have only learn the true facts under the pledge of professional secrecy to tell what he have withhold
it be not fair to ask it
it be him whom you must ask
i have ask him
i come to you as a last resource
but without your tell me anything definite mr
holmes you may do a great service if you would enlighten me on one point
what be it madam
be my husband's political career likely to suffer through this incident
well madam unless it be set right it may certainly have a very unfortunate effect
ah
she draw in her breath sharply as one whose doubt be resolve
one more question mr
holmes
from an expression which my husband drop in the first shock of this disaster i understand that terrible public consequences might arise from the loss of this document
if he say so i certainly cannot deny it
of what nature be they
nay madam there again you ask me more than i can possibly answer
then i will take up no more of your time
i cannot blame you mr
holmes for have refuse to speak more freely and you on your side will not i be sure think the worse of me because i desire even against his will to share my husband's anxieties
once more i beg that you will say nothing of my visit
she look back at us from the door and i have a last impression of that beautiful haunt face the startle eye and the draw mouth
then she be go
now watson the fair sex be your department say holmes with a smile when the dwindle frou frou of skirt have end in the slam of the front door
what be the fair lady's game
what do she really want
surely her own statement be clear and her anxiety very natural
hum
think of her appearance watson her manner her suppress excitement her restlessness her tenacity in ask question
remember that she come of a caste who do not lightly show emotion
she be certainly much move
remember also the curious earnestness with which she assure us that it be best for her husband that she should know all
what do she mean by that
and you must have observe watson how she manoeuvre to have the light at her back
she do not wish us to read her expression
yes she choose the one chair in the room
and yet the motives of women be so inscrutable
you remember the woman at margate whom i suspect for the same reason
no powder on her nose that prove to be the correct solution
how can you build on such a quicksand
their most trivial action may mean volumes or their most extraordinary conduct may depend upon a hairpin or a curl tongs
good morning watson
you be off
yes i will wile away the morning at godolphin street with our friends of the regular establishment
with eduardo lucas lie the solution of our problem though i must admit that i have not an inkling as to what form it may take
it be a capital mistake to theorize in advance of the facts
do you stay on guard my good watson and receive any fresh visitors
i'll join you at lunch if i be able
all that day and the next and the next holmes be in a mood which his friends would call taciturn and others morose
he run out and run in smoke incessantly play snatch on his violin sink into reveries devour sandwich at irregular hours and hardly answer the casual question which i put to him
it be evident to me that things be not go well with him or his quest
he would say nothing of the case and it be from the paper that i learn the particulars of the inquest and the arrest with the subsequent release of john mitton the valet of the decease
the coroner's jury bring in the obvious wilful murder but the party remain as unknown as ever
no motive be suggest
the room be full of article of value but none have be take
the dead man's paper have not be tamper with
they be carefully examine and show that he be a keen student of international politics an indefatigable gossip a remarkable linguist and an untiring letter writer
he have be on intimate term with the lead politicians of several countries
but nothing sensational be discover among the document which fill his drawers
as to his relations with women they appear to have be promiscuous but superficial
he have many acquaintances among them but few friends and no one whom he love
his habit be regular his conduct inoffensive
his death be an absolute mystery and likely to remain so
as to the arrest of john mitton the valet it be a counsel of despair as an alternative to absolute inaction
but no case could be sustain against him
he have visit friends in hammersmith that night
the alibi be complete
it be true that he start home at an hour which should have bring him to westminster before the time when the crime be discover but his own explanation that he have walk part of the way seem probable enough in view of the fineness of the night
he have actually arrive at twelve o'clock and appear to be overwhelm by the unexpected tragedy
he have always be on good term with his master
several of the dead man's possessions notably a small case of razor have be find in the valet's box but he explain that they have be present from the decease and the housekeeper be able to corroborate the story
mitton have be in lucas's employment for three years
it be noticeable that lucas do not take mitton on the continent with him
sometimes he visit paris for three months on end but mitton be leave in charge of the godolphin street house
as to the housekeeper she have hear nothing on the night of the crime
if her master have a visitor he have himself admit him
so for three mornings the mystery remain so far as i could follow it in the paper
if holmes know more he keep his own counsel but as he tell me that inspector lestrade have take him into his confidence in the case i know that he be in close touch with every development
upon the fourth day there appear a long telegram from paris which seem to solve the whole question
a discovery have just be make by the parisian police say the daily telegraph which raise the veil which hang round the tragic fate of mr
eduardo lucas who meet his death by violence last monday night at godolphin street westminster
our readers will remember that the decease gentleman be find stab in his room and that some suspicion attach to his valet but that the case break down on an alibi
yesterday a lady who have be know as mme
henri fournaye occupy a small villa in the rue austerlitz be report to the authorities by her servants as be insane
an examination show that she have indeed develop mania of a dangerous and permanent form
on inquiry the police have discover that mme
henri fournaye only return from a journey to london on tuesday last and there be evidence to connect her with the crime at westminster
a comparison of photograph have prove conclusively that m henri fournaye and eduardo lucas be really one and the same person and that the decease have for some reason live a double life in london and paris
mme
fournaye who be of creole origin be of an extremely excitable nature and have suffer in the past from attack of jealousy which have amount to frenzy
it be conjecture that it be in one of these that she commit the terrible crime which have cause such a sensation in london
her movements upon the monday night have not yet be trace but it be undoubted that a woman answer to her description attract much attention at char cross station on tuesday morning by the wildness of her appearance and the violence of her gesture
it be probable therefore that the crime be either commit when insane or that its immediate effect be to drive the unhappy woman out of her mind
at present she be unable to give any coherent account of the past and the doctor hold out no hop of the re establishment of her reason
there be evidence that a woman who might have be mme
fournaye be see for some hours on monday night watch the house in godolphin street
what do you think of that holmes
i have read the account aloud to him while he finish his breakfast
my dear watson say he as he rise from the table and pace up and down the room you be most long suffer but if i have tell you nothing in the last three days it be because there be nothing to tell
even now this report from paris do not help us much
surely it be final as regard the man's death
the man's death be a mere incident a trivial episode in comparison with our real task which be to trace this document and save a european catastrophe
only one important thing have happen in the last three days and that be that nothing have happen
i get report almost hourly from the government and it be certain that nowhere in europe be there any sign of trouble
now if this letter be loose no it can't be loose but if it isn't loose where can it be
who have it
why be it hold back
that's the question that beat in my brain like a hammer
be it indeed a coincidence that lucas should meet his death on the night when the letter disappear
do the letter ever reach him
if so why be it not among his paper
do this mad wife of his carry it off with her
if so be it in her house in paris
how could i search for it without the french police have their suspicions arouse
it be a case my dear watson where the law be as dangerous to us as the criminals be
every man's hand be against us and yet the interest at stake be colossal
should i bring it to a successful conclusion it will certainly represent the crown glory of my career
ah here be my latest from the front
he glance hurriedly at the note which have be hand in
halloa
lestrade seem to have observe something of interest
put on your hat watson and we will stroll down together to westminster
it be my first visit to the scene of the crime a high dingy narrow chested house prim formal and solid like the century which give it birth
lestrade's bulldog feature gaze out at us from the front window and he greet us warmly when a big constable have open the door and let us in
the room into which we be show be that in which the crime have be commit but no trace of it now remain save an ugly irregular stain upon the carpet
this carpet be a small square drugget in the centre of the room surround by a broad expanse of beautiful old fashion wood floor in square block highly polish
over the fireplace be a magnificent trophy of weapons one of which have be use on that tragic night
in the window be a sumptuous write desk and every detail of the apartment the picture the rugs and the hang all point to a taste which be luxurious to the verge of effeminacy
see the paris news
ask lestrade
holmes nod
our french friends seem to have touch the spot this time
no doubt it's just as they say
she knock at the door surprise visit i guess for he keep his life in water tight compartments
he let her in couldn't keep her in the street
she tell him how she have trace him reproach him one thing lead to another and then with that dagger so handy the end soon come
it wasn't all do in an instant though for these chair be all sweep over yonder and he have one in his hand as if he have try to hold her off with it
we've get it all clear as if we have see it
holmes raise his eyebrows
and yet you have send for me
ah yes that's another matter a mere trifle but the sort of thing you take an interest in queer you know and what you might call freakish
it have nothing to do with the main fact can't have on the face of it
what be it then
well you know after a crime of this sort we be very careful to keep things in their position
nothing have be move
officer in charge here day and night
this morning as the man be bury and the investigation over so far as this room be concern we think we could tidy up a bite
this carpet
you see it be not fasten down only just lay there
we have occasion to raise it
we find yes
you find holmes's face grow tense with anxiety
well i'm sure you would never guess in a hundred years what we do find
you see that stain on the carpet
well a great deal must have soak through must it not
undoubtedly it must
well you will be surprise to hear that there be no stain on the white woodwork to correspond
no stain
but there must yes so you would say
but the fact remain that there isn't
he take the corner of the carpet in his hand and turn it over he show that it be indeed as he say
but the underside be as stain as the upper
it must have leave a mark
lestrade chuckle with delight at have puzzle the famous expert
now i'll show you the explanation
there be a second stain but it do not correspond with the other
see for yourself
as he speak he turn over another portion of the carpet and there sure enough be a great crimson spill upon the square white face of the old fashion floor
what do you make of that mr
holmes
why it be simple enough
the two stain do correspond but the carpet have be turn round
as it be square and unfasten it be easily do
the official police don't need you mr
holmes to tell them that the carpet must have be turn round
that's clear enough for the stain lie above each other if you lay it over this way
but what i want to know be who shift the carpet and why
i could see from holmes's rigid face that he be vibrate with inward excitement
look here lestrade say he have that constable in the passage be in charge of the place all the time
yes he have
well take my advice
examine him carefully
don't do it before us
we'll wait here
you take him into the back room
you'll be more likely to get a confession out of him alone
ask him how he dare to admit people and leave them alone in this room
don't ask him if he have do it
take it for grant
tell him you know someone have be here
press him
tell him that a full confession be his only chance of forgiveness
do exactly what i tell you
by george if he know i'll have it out of him
cry lestrade
he dart into the hall and a few moments later his bully voice sound from the back room
now watson now
cry holmes with frenzied eagerness
all the demoniacal force of the man mask behind that listless manner burst out in a paroxysm of energy
he tear the drugget from the floor and in an instant be down on his hand and knees claw at each of the square of wood beneath it
one turn sideways as he dig his nail into the edge of it
it hinge back like the lid of a box
a small black cavity open beneath it
holmes plunge his eager hand into it and draw it out with a bitter snarl of anger and disappointment
it be empty
quick watson quick
get it back again
the wooden lid be replace and the drugget have only just be draw straight when lestrade's voice be hear in the passage
he find holmes lean languidly against the mantelpiece resign and patient endeavour to conceal his irrepressible yawn
sorry to keep you wait mr
holmes
i can see that you be bore to death with the whole affair
well he have confess all right
come in here macpherson
let these gentlemen hear of your most inexcusable conduct
the big constable very hot and penitent sidle into the room
i mean no harm sir i'm sure
the young woman come to the door last even mistake the house she do
and then we get talk
it's lonesome when you're on duty here all day
well what happen then
she want to see where the crime be do have read about it in the paper she say
she be a very respectable well speak young woman sir and i saw no harm in let her have a peep
when she saw that mark on the carpet down she drop on the floor and lay as if she be dead
i run to the back and get some water but i could not bring her to
then i go round the corner to the ivy plant for some brandy and by the time i have bring it back the young woman have recover and be off ashamed of herself i dare say and dare not face me
how about move that drugget
well sir it be a bite rumple certainly when i come back
you see she fell on it and it lie on a polish floor with nothing to keep it in place
i straighten it out afterwards
it's a lesson to you that you can't deceive me constable macpherson say lestrade with dignity
no doubt you think that your breach of duty could never be discover and yet a mere glance at that drugget be enough to convince me that someone have be admit to the room
it's lucky for you my man that nothing be miss or you would find yourself in queer street
i'm sorry to have call you down over such a petty business mr
holmes but i think the point of the second stain not correspond with the first would interest you
certainly it be most interest
have this woman only be here once constable
yes sir only once
who be she
don't know the name sir
be answer an advertisement about type write and come to the wrong number very pleasant genteel young woman sir
tall
handsome
yes sir she be a well grow young woman
i suppose you might say she be handsome
perhaps some would say she be very handsome
'oh officer do let me have a peep '
say she
she have pretty coax ways as you might say and i think there be no harm in let her just put her head through the door
how be she dress
quiet sir a long mantle down to her feet
what time be it
it be just grow dusk at the time
they be light the lamps as i come back with the brandy
very good say holmes
come watson i think that we have more important work elsewhere
as we leave the house lestrade remain in the front room while the repentant constable open the door to let us out
holmes turn on the step and hold up something in his hand
the constable star intently
good lord sir
he cry with amazement on his face
holmes put his finger on his lips replace his hand in his breast pocket and burst out laugh as we turn down the street
excellent
say he
come friend watson the curtain ring up for the last act
you will be relieve to hear that there will be no war that the right honourable trelawney hope will suffer no set back in his brilliant career that the indiscreet sovereign will receive no punishment for his indiscretion that the prime minister will have no european complication to deal with and that with a little tact and management upon our part nobody will be a penny the worse for what might have be a very ugly incident
my mind fill with admiration for this extraordinary man
you have solve it
i cry
hardly that watson
there be some point which be as dark as ever
but we have so much that it will be our own fault if we cannot get the rest
we will go straight to whitehall terrace and bring the matter to a head
when we arrive at the residence of the european secretary it be for lady hilda trelawney hope that sherlock holmes inquire
we be show into the morning room
mr
holmes
say the lady and her face be pink with her indignation this be surely most unfair and ungenerous upon your part
i desire as i have explain to keep my visit to you a secret lest my husband should think that i be intrude into his affairs
and yet you compromise me by come here and so show that there be business relations between us
unfortunately madam i have no possible alternative
i have be commission to recover this immensely important paper
i must therefore ask you madam to be kind enough to place it in my hand
the lady spring to her feet with the colour all dash in an instant from her beautiful face
her eye glaze she totter i think that she would faint
then with a grand effort she rally from the shock and a supreme astonishment and indignation chase every other expression from her feature
you you insult me mr
holmes
come come madam it be useless
give up the letter
she dart to the bell
the butler shall show you out
do not ring lady hilda
if you do then all my earnest efforts to avoid a scandal will be frustrate
give up the letter and all will be set right
if you will work with me i can arrange everything
if you work against me i must expose you
she stand grandly defiant a queenly figure her eye fix upon his as if she would read his very soul
her hand be on the bell but she have forbear to ring it
you be try to frighten me
it be not a very manly thing mr
holmes to come here and browbeat a woman
you say that you know something
what be it that you know
pray sit down madam
you will hurt yourself there if you fall
i will not speak until you sit down
thank you
i give you five minutes mr
holmes
one be enough lady hilda
i know of your visit to eduardo lucas of your give him this document of your ingenious return to the room last night and of the manner in which you take the letter from the hide place under the carpet
she star at him with an ashen face and gulp twice before she could speak
you be mad mr
holmes you be mad
she cry at last
he draw a small piece of cardboard from his pocket
it be the face of a woman cut out of a portrait
i have carry this because i think it might be useful say he
the policeman have recognise it
she give a gasp and her head drop back in the chair
come lady hilda
you have the letter
the matter may still be adjust
i have no desire to bring trouble to you
my duty end when i have return the lose letter to your husband
take my advice and be frank with me it be your only chance
her courage be admirable
even now she would not own defeat
i tell you again mr
holmes that you be under some absurd illusion
holmes rise from his chair
i be sorry for you lady hilda
i have do my best for you i can see that it be all in vain
he ring the bell
the butler enter

trelawney hope at home
he will be home sir at a quarter to one
holmes glance at his watch

i implore his mercy
he say that he would return my letter if i would bring him a certain document which he describe in my husband's despatch box
he have some spy in the office who have tell him of its existence
he assure me that no harm could come to my husband
put yourself in my position mr
holmes
what be i to do

i could not mr
holmes i could not
on the one side seem certain ruin on the other terrible as it seem to take my husband's paper still in a matter of politics i could not understand the consequences while in a matter of love and trust they be only too clear to me

at last at last i have find you with her '
there be a savage struggle
i saw him with a chair in his hand a knife gleam in hers
i rush from the horrible scene run from the house and only next morning in the paper do i learn the dreadful result
that night i be happy for i have my letter and i have not see yet what the future would bring
it be the next morning that i realize that i have only exchange one trouble for another
my husband's anguish at the loss of his paper go to my heart
i could hardly prevent myself from there and then kneel down at his feet and tell him what i have do
but that again would mean a confession of the past
i come to you that morning in order to understand the full enormity of my offence
from the instant that i grasp it my whole mind be turn to the one think of get back my husband's paper
it must still be where lucas have place it for it be conceal before this dreadful woman enter the room
if it have not be for her come i should not have know where his hide place be
how be i to get into the room
for two days i watch the place but the door be never leave open
last night i make a last attempt
what i do and how i succeed you have already learn
