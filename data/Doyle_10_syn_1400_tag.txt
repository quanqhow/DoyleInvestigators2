mr barrymore be of interest to me she be a heavy <solid|strong> person very limit intensely respectable and incline to be puritanical you could hardly conceive a le emotional <subject|study> yet i have tell you how <on|along> the first night here i hear her sob <bitterly|bitter> and since then i have more than once observe trace of tear upon her <face|front> some deep <sorrow|sadness> gnaw ever at her heart sometimes <i|single> wonder if she <have|let> a guilty memory which haunt her and sometimes i suspect barrymore of be a domestic tyrant i have always felt that there be something singular and questionable in this man's character but the adventure of last <night|dark> bring all my suspicion to a head and yet it may seem a small matter in itself you be aware that i be not a very sound sleeper and since i <have|get> be on guard in this house my slumber have be lighter than <ever|always> last night <about|around> two in the morning i be arouse by a stealthy step pas my room i rise open my door and peep out a long black shadow be trail down the corridor it be throw by a man who walk softly down the passage with a candle hold in his hand he be in shirt and trouser with no <cover|extend> to his foot i could <merely|simply> see the <outline|scheme> but his height tell me that it be barrymore he walk <very|really> slowly and circumspectly and there be something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole <appearance|show> i have tell you that the corridor be <break|develop> by the balcony which run round the hall but that it be resume upon the farther <side|slope> i wait until he have pas out of sight and then i follow him when i come <round|around> the balcony he have <reach|give> the end of the farther corridor and i could see from the glimmer of <light|twinkle> through an <open|undecided> door that he have enter one of the room now all these <room|way> be unfurnished and unoccupied <so|thus> that his expedition become more mysterious than ever the <light|promiscuous> shine steadily a if he be stand motionless i creep down the passage a noiselessly a i could and peep round the corner of the door barrymore be crouch at the window with the candle hold against the glass his profile be half turn towards me and his face seem to be rigid with expectation a he star out into the blackness of the moor for some minute he stand watch intently then he give a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light <instantly|immediately> i make my way back to my <room|board> and very shortly come the stealthy step pas once more upon their <return|rejoin> journey long afterwards when i have <fall|settle> into a light sleep i hear a key turn somewhere in a lock but i could not tell whence the sound <come|get> what it all mean i cannot guess but there <be|follow> some secret <business|job> go on in this <house|household> of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the <bottom|underside> of i do not trouble you with my theory for you ask me to furnish you only with fact i have have a long talk with sir henry this morning and we have make a plan of campaign found upon my observation of last night i <will|leave> not speak about it just <now|immediately> but it should <make|get> my next <report|describe> interest read baskerville hall oct 15th my dear holmes if i be compel to leave you without much news during the <early|former> day of my mission you must acknowledge that i be make up for lose time and that <event|outcome> be now crowd thick and fast upon u in my last report i end upon my top <note|observe> with barrymore at the window and now i <have|make> <quite|rather> a budget already which will unless i be much mistake considerably surprise you <thing|matter> <have|let> take a turn which i could not have anticipate in some way they have within the last forty eight hour become much clearer and in some way they have become more complicate but <i|single> will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself before breakfast on the morning follow my <adventure|stake> i go down the corridor and examine the room in which barrymore have be on the night before the western window through which he have star so intently have i notice one peculiarity above all other window in the <house|home> it command the nearest outlook on to the moor there be an open between two tree which enable one from this point of view to look right down upon it while from all the other window it <be|follow> only a distant glimpse which can be obtain it <follow|be> therefore that barrymore since only this window would serve the purpose must have be look out for something or somebody upon the moor the night be very dark so that i can hardly imagine how he could have hop to see anyone it <have|take> strike me that it be possible that some love intrigue be <on|along> foot that would have account for his stealthy movement and also for the uneasiness of his wife the man be a strike <look|attend> <fellow|familiar> <very|really> well equip to steal the heart of a country girl so that this theory seem to <have|give> something to support it that <open|unfold> of the door which i have hear after i have <return|yield> to my room might mean that he have go out to keep some clandestine appointment <so|then> i reason with myself in the morning and i tell you the direction of my suspicion however much the result may have show that they be unfounded but whatever the <true|reliable> explanation of barrymore's movement might be <i|single> <felt|find> that the responsibility of keep them to myself until i could explain them be more than i could bear i have an interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast and i tell him all that i have see he be le surprise than i have expect i know that barrymore walk about night and i have a mind to speak to him about it say he two or three time i have hear his step in the passage come and go <just|only> about the hour you name perhaps then he pay a visit every night to that particular window i suggest perhaps he do if so we should be able to shadow him and <see|realize> what it <be|follow> that he be after <i|single> wonder what your <friend|admirer> holmes would do if he be here i believe that he would do exactly what you <now|instantly> suggest say i he would follow barrymore and see what he do then we shall <do|come> it together but <surely|certainly> he would hear u the man <be|follow> rather deaf and in any case we must take our chance of that we'll sit up in my <room|way> tonight and wait until he pas sir henry rub his hand with pleasure and it be <evident|manifest> that he hail the adventure a a <relief|ease> to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor the baronet have be in communication with the architect who prepare the plan for sir charles and with a contractor from london so that we may expect great change to begin here soon there have be decorator and furnishers up from plymouth and it be <evident|unmistakable> that our friend have large idea and mean to <spare|save> no pain or expense to restore the grandeur of his family when the house be renovate and refurnish all that he will <need|take> <will|leave> be a wife to make it complete between ourselves there <be|follow> pretty clear sign that this will not be want if the lady be will for i <have|let> seldom see a man more infatuate with a woman than he be with our beautiful neighbour <miss|overlook> stapleton and yet the course of true love do not run quite a <smoothly|swimmingly> a one would under the circumstance expect today for example it surface be <break|give> by a very unexpected ripple which have cause our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance after the conversation which i have quote about barrymore sir henry put on his hat and prepare to <go|run> out a a matter of course i do the same what be you come watson he ask look at me in a curious way that depend on whether you <be|follow> go on the moor say i yes i be well you know what my <instruction|statement> be i be sorry to intrude but you hear how earnestly holmes insist that i should not leave you and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor sir henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile my dear fellow say he holmes with all his wisdom do not foresee some thing which have happen since i have be on the <moor|moorland> you <understand|realize> me i be <sure|certain> that you be the last man in the world who would wish to be a <spoil|bungle> sport i must go out alone it put me in a most awkward position i be at a loss what to say or what to do and before i have make up my mind he pick up his cane and be go but when i come to think the matter over my conscience reproach me bitterly for have on any pretext allow him to go out of my sight i imagine what my feel would be if i have to <return|give> to you and to confess that some misfortune have <occur|come> through my disregard for your instruction i assure you my cheek <flush|thrill> at the very think it might not even <now|immediately> be too late to overtake him so i <set|do> off at once in the direction of merripit house <i|single> hurry along the road at the <top|crest> of my <speed|quicken> without <see|find> anything of sir henry until i <come|do> to the point where the moor path branch off there fear that perhaps i have come in the wrong direction after all i mount a hill from which i could command a view the same hill which be cut into the dark <quarry|prey> thence i saw him at once he be on the moor path about a quarter of a mile off and a lady be by his side who could only be miss stapleton it be clear that there be already an understand between them and that they have <meet|see> by appointment they be walk slowly along in deep conversation and i <saw|consider> her make quick little movement of her <hand|paw> a if she be very earnest in what she be say while he listen intently and <once|formerly> or twice shake his <head|principal> in strong dissent i stand among the rock watch them very much puzzle a to what i should do next to follow them and break into their intimate conversation seem to be an outrage and yet my clear duty be never for an instant to let him out of my sight to <act|do> the spy upon a friend be a hateful task still i could see no <better|effective> course than to observe him from the hill and to clear my conscience by confess to him afterwards what i <have|let> do it be true that if any sudden danger have threaten him i be <too|excessively> far away to be of use and yet <i|single> be sure that you will agree with me that the position be very difficult and that there be nothing more which i could do our friend sir henry and the lady have halt on the path and <be|follow> stand <deeply|profoundly> absorb in their conversation when i <be|follow> suddenly aware that i be not the <only|solitary> witness of their <interview|question> a wisp of green float in the <air|breeze> catch my eye and another glance show me that it be <carry|run> on a stick by a man who be move among the break grind it be stapleton with his butterfly net he be very much <closer|close> to the pair than i be and he appear to be move in their direction at this instant sir henry suddenly <draw|run> miss stapleton to his side his arm be round her but it seem to me that she be strain away from him with her face avert he stoop his head to hers and she raise one <hand|reach> a if in protest next moment i saw them <spring|give> apart and turn hurriedly round stapleton be the cause of the interruption he be run wildly towards them his absurd <net|last> dangle behind him he gesticulate and almost dance with excitement in <front|look> of the lover what the scene mean i could not imagine but it seem to me that stapleton be abuse sir henry who offer explanation which become more angry a the <other|former> refuse to accept them the lady stand by in haughty <silence|hush> finally stapleton turn upon his heel and beckon in a peremptory <way|fashion> to his sister who after an irresolute glance at sir henry walk off by the side of her brother the naturalist's angry gesture show that the lady be include in his displeasure the baronet <stand|support> for a minute look after them and then he walk slowly back the way that he have <come|follow> his head hang the very picture of dejection what all this mean i could not imagine but i be deeply ashamed to have witness so intimate a <scene|fit> without my friend's knowledge i run down the hill therefore and meet the baronet at the bottom his face be flush with anger and his brow be wrinkle like one who be at his wit's end what to do halloa watson where have you drop from <say|pronounce> he you don't mean to say that you come after me in spite of all i explain everything to him how i <have|get> find it impossible to remain behind how i have follow him and how i have witness all that have <occur|happen> for an instant his eye blaze at me but my frankness disarm his anger and he break at last into a rather rueful laugh you would have think the <middle|centre> of that prairie a fairly safe place for a <man|world> to be private say he but by thunder the whole countryside seem to have be out to see me do my woo and a mighty poor woo at that where have you engage a seat i be <on|along> that hill quite in the back row eh but her brother be well up to the front do you see him <come|follow> out <on|along> u yes i do do he ever strike you a be crazy this brother of hers i can't say that he ever do i dare say not i always think him <sane|reasonable> enough until today but you can take it from me that either he or i ought to be in a straitjacket what's the matter with me anyhow you've live <near|about> me for some week watson <tell|say> me <straight|directly> now be there anything that would prevent me from make a good husband to a <woman|char> that i love i should say not he can't object to my worldly position so it must be myself that he <have|take> this down <on|along> what have he against me i never hurt man or woman in my <life|spirit> that i know of and yet he would not so much a <let|permit> me touch the tip of her <finger|feel> do he say so that and a <deal|lot> more i <tell|say> you watson i've <only|alone> know her these few week but from the first i just felt that she be make for me and she <too|likewise> she be happy when she be with me and that i'll swear there's a <light|clean> in a woman's <eye|centre> that speak louder than word but he have never <let|get> u get together and it be only today for the first time that i saw a <chance|opportunity> of have a few <word|intelligence> with her <alone|unparalleled> she be glad to meet me but when she do it be not love that she would talk about and she wouldn't have let me talk about it either if she could have stop it she keep <come|get> back to it that this be a place of danger and that she would never be happy until i have leave it i <tell|say> her that since i have see her i be in no hurry to leave it and that if she really want me to go the <only|solitary> way to work it be for her to arrange to go with me with that i <offer|fling> in a many word to marry her but before she could answer down come this brother of hers run at u with a face on him like a madman he be <just|hardly> white with <rage|storm> and those light eye of his <be|follow> blaze with <fury|vehemence> what be <i|single> do with the lady how dare i offer her attention which be distasteful to her <do|fare> i think that because i be a baronet i could do what i like if he have not be her brother i should have know <better|full> how to answer him a it be i tell him that my feel towards his sister be such a i <be|follow> not ashamed of and that i hop that she might honour me by become my wife that <seem|appear> to <make|take> the matter no better so then i lose my <temper|irritation> too and i answer him rather more hotly than i should perhaps consider that she be stand by so it end by his <go|work> off with her a you saw and here be i a badly puzzle a man a any in this county just <tell|say> me what it all mean watson and i'll owe you more than ever i can hope to pay i try one or two explanation but indeed i be <completely|altogether> puzzle myself our friend's title his fortune his age his character and his appearance be all in his <favour|prefer> and i know nothing against him unless it be this <dark|sorry> fate which run in his <family|home> that his advance should be reject so brusquely without any reference to the lady's own wish and that the lady should accept the <situation|spot> without protest <be|follow> very amaze however our conjecture be set at <rest|relaxation> by a visit from stapleton himself that <very|really> afternoon he have come to <offer|go> apology for his rudeness of the morning and after a long <private|individual> interview with sir henry in his study the upshot of their conversation <be|follow> that the <breach|offend> be quite heal and that we be to dine at merripit house next friday a a sign of it i don't say now that he isn't a crazy man say sir henry i can't forget the look in his eye when he run at me this <morning|dawn> but i must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he have do do he <give|leave> any explanation of his conduct his sister be everything in his life he say that be natural enough and i be glad that he should <understand|see> her value they <have|give> always be together and accord to his account he have be a very <lonely|solitary> man with only her a a companion so that the <think|imagine> of lose her <be|follow> really terrible to him he <have|take> not understand he say that i be become attach to her but when he saw with his own eye that it be really so and that she might <be|follow> take away from him it give him such a shock that for a time he be not responsible for what he say or do he be very sorry for all that <have|make> pas and he recognize how foolish and how selfish it be that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life if she have to leave him he have rather it be to a neighbour like myself than to anyone else but in any case it be a blow to him and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself to meet it he would withdraw all opposition upon his part if i would promise for three month to let the matter rest and to be content with cultivate the lady's friendship during that time without claim her love this <i|single> <promise|forebode> and so the <matter|affair> rest so there be one of our <small|low> <mystery|enigma> clear up it be something to have <touch|equal> bottom anywhere in this bog in which we be flounder we know now why stapleton look with disfavour upon his sister's suitor even when that suitor be <so|indeed> eligible a one a sir henry and now i pas on to another thread which i have extricate out of the <tangle|knot> skein the mystery of the sob in the night of the tear stain face of mr i'm not so light to lift a i use to be gregson and lestrade exchange <glance|glint> a if they think this proposition rather a bold one but holmes at once take the prisoner at his word and loosen the towel which we have bind round his ancles he <rise|develop> and stretch his leg a though to assure himself that they be free once more i remember that i think to myself a i eye him that i have seldom see a more powerfully build man and his dark sunburn face bore an expression of determination and <energy|push> which be a formidable a his personal strength if there's a vacant <place|spot> for a chief of the police i reckon you be the <man|mankind> for it he say gaze with undisguised admiration at my fellow lodger the way you <keep|save> on my trail be a caution you have better come with me say holmes to the two detective i can drive you say lestrade good and gregson can come inside with me you too doctor you <have|let> take an <interest|pursuit> in the case and may a well stick to u i assent gladly and we all descend together our prisoner make no attempt at escape but step calmly into the cab which have be his and we follow him lestrade mount the box whip up the horse and bring u in a very short time to our destination we be usher into a small chamber where a police inspector note down our prisoner's name and the name of the <men|gentleman> with whose murder he have be charge the official be a white face unemotional man who go through his duty in a dull mechanical way the prisoner <will|leave> be put before the magistrate in the course of the week he say in the mean <time|sentence> mr jefferson hope have you anything that you wish to say i must warn you that your word will be <take|have> down and may be use against you i've get a good deal to say our prisoner say slowly i want to tell you gentleman all about it hadn't you better reserve that for your <trial|test> ask the inspector i may never be <try|render> he <answer|do> you needn't look startle it isn't suicide i be think of be you a <doctor|fix> he turn his fierce dark eye upon me a he <ask|expect> this last question yes i be i answer then put your hand here he say with a smile motion with his manacle wrist towards his chest i do so and become at once conscious of an extraordinary throb and commotion which be go on <inside|within> the wall of his chest seem to thrill and quiver a a <frail|weak> build would do inside when some powerful engine be at work in the silence of the room i could hear a dull hum and buzz <noise|interference> which proceed from the same <source|root> why i <cry|yell> you have an aortic aneurism that's what they call it he say placidly <i|single> go to a doctor last week about it and he tell me that it be bind to burst before many day pas it have be get worse for year i get it from over exposure and under feed among the salt lake mountain i've do my work now and i don't care how soon i go but i should like to leave some account of the business behind me i don't want to be remember a a common cut throat the inspector and the two detective have a hurry discussion a to the advisability of allow him to tell his story do you consider doctor that there be immediate danger the former ask most certainly there be i answer in that case it be <clearly|distinctly> our duty in the <interest|worry> of justice to take his statement say the inspector you be at liberty sir to give your account which i again warn you will be take down i'll sit down with your leave the prisoner say suit the action to the word this aneurism of mine make me easily tire and the tussle we have half an hour ago <have|get> not mend matter i'm on the brink of the grave and i <be|follow> not likely to lie to you every <word|intelligence> i say be the absolute truth and how you <use|apply> it be a <matter|count> of no consequence to me with these word jefferson hope lean back in his <chair|lead> and begin the follow remarkable statement he speak in a calm and methodical manner a though the event which he narrate <be|follow> commonplace enough i can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoin account for i have have access to lestrade's note book in which the prisoner's word be <take|assume> down exactly a they be utter it don't much matter to you why i hat these men he say it's enough that they be guilty of the death of two human be a father and a daughter and that they have therefore forfeit their own live after the lapse of time that have pas since their crime it <be|follow> impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court i know of their guilt though and i determine that i should be judge jury and executioner all roll into one you'd have do the same if you have any manhood in you if you have be in my <place|set> that girl that i <speak|utter> of be to have marry me twenty year ago she <be|follow> force into marry that same drebber and break her <heart|nerve> over it i take the marriage ring from her <dead|idle> <finger|feel> and i vow that his die eye should rest upon that very ring and that his last thought should be of the crime for which he be punish i have carry it <about|around> with me and have <follow|come> him and his accomplice over two continent until i <catch|see> them they think to tire me out but they could not do it if <i|single> die to morrow a <be|follow> likely enough i die know that my <work|solve> in this world be do and well do they have perish and by my hand there be <nothing|naught> <leave|provide> for me to hope for or to desire they be rich and <i|single> be poor so that it be no easy matter for me to follow them when i get to london my pocket be <about|near> empty and i find that i must turn my hand to something for my live drive and rid <be|follow> a natural to me a walk so <i|single> <apply|give> at a cabowner's office and soon get employment i be to bring a certain sum a week to the owner and whatever be over that i might keep for myself there be seldom much over but i manage to scrape along somehow the hardest job be to learn my way about for i reckon that of all the maze that ever <be|follow> contrive this city be the <most|nearly> confuse i have a map beside me though and when once i <have|give> spot the principal hotel and station i get on pretty well it be some time before i find out where my two gentleman be <live|alive> but i inquire and <inquire|investigate> until at last i <drop|dismiss> across them they be at a board house at camberwell over on the other side of the river when once i <find|get> them out i know that i <have|take> them at my mercy i have grow my beard and there be no chance of their recognize me i would dog them and follow them until i saw my <opportunity|chance> i be <determine|see> that they should not escape me again they be very near do it for all that go where they would about london i be always at their heel sometimes i <follow|be> them on my cab and sometimes on foot but the <former|other> be the best for then they could not get away from me it be only early in the morning or late at <night|dark> that i could <earn|make> anything so that i begin to get behind hand with my employer i do not mind that however a long a i could lay my hand upon the men i want they be very cunning though they must <have|let> think that there be some chance of their be follow for they would never go out <alone|only> and never after nightfall during two week i <drive|get> behind them every day and never once <saw|find> them separate drebber himself <be|follow> drink half the time but stangerson be not to be catch nap i watch them late and early but never saw the ghost of a chance but i be not discourage for something <tell|say> me that the hour have <almost|nearly> come my only fear be that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon and <leave|will> my <work|play> undo at last one even i be <drive|get> up and down torquay terrace a the street be call in which they board when i saw a cab <drive|push> up to their door presently some luggage be bring out and after a time drebber and stangerson follow it and drive off i whip up my horse and keep within sight of them feel very ill at ease for i fear that they <be|follow> go to shift their quarter at euston station they get out and i <leave|will> a boy to hold my horse and follow them on to the platform i hear them ask for the liverpool train and the guard answer that one <have|take> just go and there would not be another for some hour stangerson seem to be put out at that but drebber be rather please than otherwise i get so close to them in the <bustle|hustle> that i could <hear|see> every word that <pas|dad> between them drebber say that he have a little business of his own to do and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him his companion remonstrate with him and remind him that they <have|make> resolve to stick together drebber <answer|resolve> that the matter be a delicate one and that he must go alone i could not catch what stangerson say to that but the other <burst|split> out swear and remind him that he be nothing more than his <pay|yield> servant and that he must not <presume|assume> to dictate to him on that the secretary give it up a a bad job and simply <bargain|buy> with him that if he miss the last train he should rejoin him at halliday's private hotel to which drebber answer that he would be back on the platform before eleven and <make|do> his way out of the <station|send> the moment for which i have wait so long have at last come i have my enemy <within|inside> my power together they could protect each other but singly they be at my mercy i do not act however with undue precipitation my plan be already form there be no satisfaction in <vengeance|retribution> unless the offender <have|take> time to <realize|see> who it be that <strike|fall> him and why retribution have come upon him i <have|let> my plan arrange by which i should have the opportunity of make the man who have wrong me understand that his old sin have find him out it <chance|luck> that some day before a gentleman who have be engage in <look|count> over some house in the brixton road <have|get> <drop|swing> the <key|discover> of one of them in my carriage it be claim that same even and return but in the interval i have take a <mould|stamp> of it and have a duplicate construct by mean of this i have access to at least one <spot|situation> in this great city where i could rely upon be free from interruption how to get drebber to that house be the difficult problem which i have <now|instantly> to solve he walk down the <road|route> and go into one or two liquor shop stay for nearly half an hour in the last of them when he come out he stagger in his walk and be evidently pretty well on there be a hansom <just|exactly> in front of me and he <hail|come> it i follow it so close that the nose of my horse be within a <yard|thousand> of his driver the <whole|solid> way we rattle across waterloo bridge and through mile of street until to my astonishment we find ourselves back in the terrace in which he have board i could not imagine what his intention be in return there but i go on and pull up my cab a hundred <yard|pace> or so from the house he enter it and his hansom drive away give me a glass of water if you please my mouth get dry with the talk <i|single> hand him the glass and he drink it down that's better he say well i wait for a quarter of an hour or more when suddenly there come a noise like people struggle inside the house next moment the door <be|follow> fling open and two men appear one of whom be drebber and the other be a young chap whom i <have|get> never see before this fellow have drebber by the collar and when they come to the head of the step he give him a shove and a kick which send him half across the road 'you hound he cry shake his stick at him i ll teach you to insult an honest girl he be so hot that i think he would have thrash drebber with his cudgel only that the cur <stagger|swag> away down the road a fast a his leg would carry him he run a far a the corner and then see my cab he hail me and jump in 'drive me to halliday's private hotel say he when i have him fairly inside my cab my heart jump so with joy that <i|single> fear lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong i drive along slowly weigh in my own mind what it be best to do i might <take|remove> him right out into the country and there in some desert lane have my last interview with him i have almost <decide|settle> upon this when he solve the problem for me the <craze|fury> for drink have seize him again and he order me to pull up outside a gin palace he <go|fling> in leave <word|phrase> that i should wait for him there he remain until <close|last> time and when he come out he be so far go that i know the game be in my own hand don't imagine that i intend to kill him in <cold|dusty> <blood|line> it would only have be rigid justice if i have <do|come> so but i could not bring myself to do it i have long determine that he should have a show for his life if he choose to take advantage of it among the many billet which i have fill in america during my wander <life|lifetime> i be once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at york college one day the professor be lecture on poisions and he <show|establish> his student some alkaloid a he call it

the rule have you ever have occasion to study character in handwrite what do you make of this fellow's scribble it be legible and regular i answer a man of business habit and some force of character holmes shake his head look at his long letter he say they hardly rise above the common herd that d might be an a and that l an e men of character always differentiate their long letter <however|yet> illegibly they may write there be vacillation in his k's and self esteem in his capital i be go out now i have some few <reference|address> to make <let|allow> me recommend this book one of the <most|almost> remarkable <ever|always> pen it be winwood reade's 'martyrdom of man i shall be back in an <hour|minute> i sit in the window with the volume in my hand but my <thought|think> be far from the dare <speculation|conjecture> of the <writer|author> my mind run upon our <late|previous> visitor her smile the <deep|inscrutable> rich tone of her voice the strange <mystery|secret> which overhang her life if she be seventeen at the time of her father's disappearance she must be seven and twenty <now|directly> a sweet age when youth have lose it self consciousness and become a little sober by experience so i sit and muse until such <dangerous|grievous> thought come into my head that <i|single> hurry away to my desk and plunge furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology what be i an army surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker bank account that i should dare to think of such <thing|matter> she <be|follow> a <unit|social_unit> a factor <nothing|zero> more if my future be black it be <better|easily> <surely|certainly> to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will o' the wisp of the imagination it be half past five before holmes return he <be|follow> bright eager and in excellent spirit a mood which in his case alternate with <fit|correspond> of the blackest depression there be no great mystery in this matter he say take the cup of tea which i have pour out for him the fact appear to admit of only one explanation what you have solve it already <well|easily> that would be too much to say i have discover a suggestive fact that be all it be however very suggestive the detail be still to be add i have just find on consult the back file of the time that major sholto of upper norword late of the 34th bombay infantry die upon the 28th of april i may be very obtuse holmes but i fail to see what this suggest no you surprise me look at it in this way then captain morstan disappear the only person in london whom he could have <visit|call> be major sholto major sholto deny <have|let> hear that he be in london four year later sholto die <within|inside> a week of his death <captain|master> morstan's daughter receive a valuable <present|exhibit> which be <repeat|reiterate> from year to year and now culminate in a letter which describe her a a wrong woman what wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her father and why should the present begin immediately after sholto's death unless it be that sholto's heir <know|recognize> something of the mystery and desire to make compensation have you any alternative theory which will meet the fact but what a strange compensation and how strangely make why too should he write a letter now rather than six <year|class> ago again the letter <speak|address> of <give|open> her justice what justice can she have it be too much to suppose that her father be still alive there be no other injustice in her case that you know of there be difficulty there be certainly difficulty say sherlock holmes pensively but our expedition of to night will solve them all ah here be a four wheeler and miss morstan be inside be you all ready then we have <better|safe> go down for it be a little past the hour i pick up my <hat|lid> and my heaviest stick but i observe that holmes take his revolver from his drawer and slip it into his pocket it <be|follow> clear that he think that our night's work might be a <serious|good> one miss morstan be muffle in a dark cloak and her sensitive face be compose but pale she must have be more than woman if she do not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we be embark yet her self <control|manipulate> <be|follow> perfect and she readily answer the few additional question which sherlock holmes put to her major sholto be a very particular friend of papa's she say his letter be <full|good> of allusion to the major he and papa be in command of the troop at the andaman island so they be <throw|have> a great deal together by the way a curious paper be find in papa's desk which no one could understand i don't <suppose|say> that it be of the slightest importance but i think you might care to see it so i bring it with me it be here holmes unfold the <paper|newspaper> carefully and smooth it out upon his knee he then very methodically examine it all over with his double lens it be paper of native indian <manufacture|cook_up> he remark it have at some time be pin to a board the diagram upon it appear to be a <plan|contrive> of <part|character> of a <large|great> build with numerous hall

line with their arm touch beside it be write in very rough and coarse character 'the sign of the four jonathan small mahomet singh abdullah khan dost akbar no i confess that i <do|come> not see how this bear upon the matter yet it be evidently a document of importance it <have|make> be keep carefully in a pocket book for the one side be a clean a the other it <be|follow> in his pocket book that we find it preserve it carefully then miss morstan for it may <prove|establish> to be of use to u i begin to suspect that this <matter|weigh> may turn out to be much deeper and more <subtle|elusive> than i at first suppose i must reconsider my <idea|thought> he lean back in the cab and i could see by his draw brow and his vacant eye that he be think intently miss morstan and i chat in an undertone about our present expedition and it possible outcome but our companion maintain his impenetrable <reserve|book> until the end of our <journey|travel> it be a september even and not

<strand|chain> the lamp be but misty splotch of diffuse light which throw a feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement the yellow glare from the shop window stream out into the steamy vaporous

light sad face and glad haggard and merry like all human kind they flit from the gloom into the light and so back into the gloom once more <i|single> be not subject to impression but the dull heavy even with the strange business upon which we be engage combine to <make|get> me nervous and depress i could see from miss morstan's manner that she be <suffer|lose> from the same feel holmes alone could rise superior to petty <influence|work> he hold his open <note|bill> book upon his knee and from time to time he jot down figure and <memoranda|memorandum> in the <light|spark> of his pocket

collect a ever i endeavor to cheer and amuse her by reminiscence of my adventure in afghanistan but to tell the truth i be myself so excite at our situation and so curious a to our destination that my

have be fix for the wed the terrible <event|outcome> occur which have deprive me of my only companion sherlock holmes have be lean back in his chair with his eye close and his head sink in a cushion but he half open his <lid|hat> now and glance across at his visitor <pray|implore> be precise a to detail say he it be easy for me to be <so|then> for every event of that dreadful time be sear into my memory the manor house be a i have already say very old and <only|simply> one wing be <now|immediately> inhabit the <bedroom|chamber> in this wing be <on|along> the grind <floor|shock> the sit room be in the central block of the build of these bedroom the first be dr roylott's the second my sister's and the third my own there be no communication between them but they all open out into the same corridor do i make myself plain perfectly so the window of the three room open out upon the lawn that fatal night dr roylott have go to his <room|board> early though we know that he have not retire to rest for my sister be trouble by the smell of the <strong|solid> indian cigar which it be his custom to smoke she leave her room therefore and <come|occur> into mine where she sit for some time chat about her <approach|advance> wed at eleven o'clock she rise to leave me but she pause at the door and look back 'tell me helen say she 'have you ever hear anyone whistle in the dead of the night 'never say i 'i <suppose|say> that you could not possibly whistle yourself in your sleep 'certainly not but why 'because during the last few night i have always about three in the morning hear a low clear whistle i be a light sleeper and it have awaken me i cannot tell where it come from perhaps from the next room perhaps from the lawn i think that i would just ask you whether you have hear it 'no i have not it must be those wretched gipsy in the plantation 'very likely and <yet|still> if it be on the lawn i wonder that you do not hear it also 'ah but i sleep more heavily than you 'well it be of no <great|big> consequence at any rate she smile back at me close my door and a few moment <later|afterward> i hear her key turn in the <lock|operate> indeed say holmes be it your <custom|usage> <always|incessantly> to lock yourselves in at night always and why i think that <i|single> mention to you that the doctor keep a cheetah and a baboon we have no <feel|experience> of <security|protection> unless our door be lock <quite|rather> so pray proceed with your statement i could not sleep that night a vague feel of impend misfortune impress me my sister and i you will <recollect|remember> be twin and you know how subtle be the link which bind two soul which be so closely ally it be a wild night the wind be howl outside and the rain be beat and splash against the window suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale there burst forth the wild scream of a terrify woman i know that it be my sister's voice i spring from my bed wrap a shawl round me and rush into the corridor a i <open|unfold> my door i seem to hear a low whistle such a my <sister|babe> describe and a few moment later a clang sound a if a mass of metal have fall a i run down the passage my sister's door be unlock and revolve slowly upon it hinge i star at it horror stricken not know what be about to issue from it by the light of the corridor lamp i saw my sister appear at the open her face blanch with terror her hand grope for <help|supporter> her whole figure sway to and fro like that of a <drunkard|drunk> i <run|go> to her and <throw|give> my arm round her but at that moment her knee seem to give way and she fell to the grind she writhe a one who be in <terrible|tremendous> <pain|bother> and her <limb|branch> be dreadfully convulse at first i think that she have not recognise me but a i bend over her she suddenly shriek out in a voice which i shall never forget 'oh my god helen it be the band the speckle band there be something else which she would fain have say and she stab with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor's room but a fresh convulsion seize her and <choke|go> her <word|news> i rush out <call|promise> loudly for my stepfather and i meet him hasten from his room in his dress <gown|nightdress> when he reach my sister's side she <be|follow> unconscious and though he pour brandy down her throat and send for medical aid from the village all effort be in vain for she slowly <sink|settle> and <die|go> without have recover her consciousness such be the dreadful end of my beloved sister one moment say holmes be you sure <about|around> this whistle and metallic sound could you swear to it that be what the county coroner <ask|take> me at the inquiry it be my strong impression that i hear it and yet among the <crash|dash> of the gale and the creak of an <old|former> house i may possibly <have|get> be deceive <be|follow> your sister dress no she be in her night <dress|attire> in her <right|good> hand be find the char stump of a match and in her leave a match box show that she have <strike|scratch> a light and look about her when the alarm take place that be important and what conclusion do the coroner come to he investigate the case with great care for dr roylott's <conduct|lead> have long be notorious in the county but he be unable to <find|see> <any|whatever> satisfactory cause of <death|end> my evidence show that the door have be fasten upon the inner side and the window be block by old <fashion|manner> shutter with broad iron <bar|streak> which be secure every night the <wall|fence> be carefully sound and be show to be <quite|rather> solid all <round|beat> and the floor be also thoroughly examine with the same <result|outcome> the chimney be wide but be bar up by four <large|big> staple it be certain therefore that my sister be quite alone when she meet her <end|conclusion> besides there be no mark of any violence upon her how about poison the doctor <examine|see> her for it but without success what do you think that this unfortunate lady <die|perish> of then it <be|follow> my belief that she die of pure fear and nervous shock though what it be that frighten her <i|single> cannot imagine be there gipsy in the plantation at the time yes there be nearly always some there ah and what do you gather from this allusion to a band a speckle band sometimes i have <think|remember> that it be merely the wild talk of delirium sometimes that it may have refer to some band of people <perhaps|possibly> to these very gipsy in the plantation i <do|make> not know whether the spot handkerchief which so many of them wear over their head might have suggest the strange adjective which she use holmes shake his head like a <man|human> who be far from be satisfy these be very deep water say he pray go on with your narrative two year have pas since then and my life have be until lately lonelier than ever a month ago however a dear friend whom i have know for many <year|class> have do me the <honour|honor> to ask my hand in marriage have you any objection to my look at your register say holmes not in the least the book show that two name have be add after that of baskerville one be theophilus johnson and family of newcastle the other mr oldmore and maid of high lodge alton surely that must be the same johnson whom i use to know say holmes to the porter a lawyer be he not gray head and walk with a limp no sir this be mr johnson the coal <owner|possessor> a very active gentleman not older than yourself surely you be mistake about his trade no sir he <have|get> use this hotel for many year and he be <very|really> well know to u ah that settle it mr oldmore too i seem to remember the <name|key> excuse my curiosity but often in call upon one friend one find another she be an invalid lady sir her husband be <once|formerly> mayor of gloucester she always come to u when she be in town thank you i <be|follow> afraid i cannot claim her acquaintance we have establish a most important fact by these <question|interrogate> watson he continue in a low voice a we go upstairs together we know now that the people who be so interest in our friend have not settle down in his own hotel that mean that while they be a we have see very anxious to watch him they be equally <anxious|nervous> that he should not see them now this be a most suggestive fact what do it suggest it suggest halloa my dear fellow what on earth be the matter a we come round the top of the stair we <have|let> run up against sir henry baskerville himself his face be flush with anger and he hold an old and dusty boot in one of his hand so furious be he that he be hardly articulate and when he do speak it be in a much broader and more western dialect than any which we have <hear|see> from him in the morning seem to me they be play me for a <sucker|gull> in this hotel he cry they'll find they've <start|jump> in to monkey with the wrong man unless they be careful by thunder if that chap can't find my miss boot there will <be|follow> trouble i can take a joke with the best mr holmes but they've <get|come> a bite over the <mark|distinguish> this time still look for your boot yes sir and mean to find it but surely you say that it be a new brown boot so it be sir and now it's an old black one what you don't mean to say that's <just|simply> what i <do|come> mean to say i only have three pair in the world the <new|young> brown the old black and the <patent|apparent> leather which i be wear last night they take one of my brown one and today they have sneak one of the black well have you <get|go> it speak out man and don't stand star an agitate german waiter have appear upon the <scene|vista> no sir i have <make|give> inquiry all over the hotel but i can <hear|see> no word of it well either that <boot|charge> come back before sundown or i'll see the manager and tell him that i go right straight out of this hotel it shall be find sir i promise you that if you will <have|make> a <little|short> patience it will be find mind it be for it's the last thing of mine that i'll lose in this den of thieve well well mr holmes you'll excuse my trouble you about such a trifle i think it's well worth trouble <about|near> why you look very <serious|good> over it how <do|make> you explain it i just don't <attempt|attack> to explain it it seem the very maddest queerest thing that ever happen to me the <queerest|curious> perhaps say holmes thoughtfully what do you make of it yourself well i don't profess to understand it <yet|still> this case of yours be very complex sir henry when take in conjunction with your uncle's death i <be|follow> not <sure|certain> that of all the five hundred case of capital importance which i have handle there be one which cut so deep but we hold several thread in our hand and the odds be that one or other of them guide u to the truth we may waste time in follow the wrong one but sooner or later we must come upon the right we have a pleasant luncheon in which little be say of the business which have bring u together it be in the private sit room to which we afterwards repair that holmes ask baskerville what be his intention to go to baskerville hall and when at the end of the week on the whole say holmes i <think|consider> that your decision be a <wise|judicious> one i have ample evidence that you <be|follow> be dog in london and amid the million of this great city it be difficult to discover who these people be or what their object can be if their <intention|design> be evil they might <do|make> you a mischief and we should be powerless to prevent it you do not know dr mortimer that you be follow this morning from my house dr mortimer start violently follow by whom that unfortunately be what <i|single> cannot tell you have you among your neighbour or acquaintance on dartmoor any man with a black full beard no or let me see why yes barrymore sir charles's butler be a <man|humanity> with a full black beard ha where be barrymore he be in <charge|care> of the hall we have best ascertain if he <be|follow> <really|very> there or if by <any|whatever> possibility he might be in london how can you do that give me a telegraph form 'is all ready for sir henry that will do address to mr barrymore baskerville <hall|mansion> what be the <nearest|nigh> telegraph office grimpen very <good|respectable> we will send a second <wire|telegram> to the postmaster grimpen 'telegram to mr barrymore to be deliver into his own hand if absent please return wire to sir henry baskerville northumberland hotel that should let u know before even whether barrymore be at his post in devonshire or not that's so say baskerville by the way dr mortimer who be this barrymore anyhow he be the son of the old caretaker who be dead they have look after the <hall|mansion> for four generation now so far a i know he and his wife be a respectable a couple a any in the county at the same time say baskerville it's clear enough that so long a there be none of the family at the <hall|mansion> these people have a mighty fine <home|domicile> and nothing to do that be true do barrymore profit at all by sir charles's will ask holmes he and his wife have five hundred pound each ha do they know that they would receive this yes sir charles be very fond of talk about the provision of his will that be very interest i hope say dr mortimer that you do not look with suspicious eye upon everyone who receive a legacy from sir charles for i <also|likewise> have a thousand pound leave to me indeed and anyone else there be many insignificant sum to individual and a <large|great> number of public charity the residue all go to sir henry and how much be the residue seven hundred and forty thousand pound holmes raise his eyebrow in surprise i have no idea that so gigantic a <sum|heart> be involve say he sir charles have the <reputation|report> of be rich but we <do|make> not know how very rich he be until we come to examine his security the total value of the estate be close on to a million dear me it be a <stake|hazard> for which a man might well play a desperate game and one more question dr mortimer suppose that anything happen to our young friend here you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis who would inherit the estate since rodger baskerville sir charles's younger brother die unmarried the estate would descend to the desmonds who be distant cousin jam desmond <be|follow> an elderly clergyman in westmoreland thank you these detail be all of <great|outstanding> interest have you meet mr <jam|crush> desmond yes he once come down to visit sir charles he be a man of venerable appearance and of saintly life i remember that he refuse to <accept|assume> any settlement from sir charles though he press it upon him and this man of simple taste would be the heir to sir charles's thousand he would <be|follow> the heir to the estate because that be entail he would also be the heir to the money unless it be will otherwise by the present owner who can of <course|form> do what he like with it and have you make your will sir henry no mr holmes i have not i've have no time for it be only yesterday that i learn how matter <stand|tolerate> but in any case i feel that the money should <go|get> with the title and estate that be my poor uncle's idea how be the owner <go|run> to restore the glory of the baskervilles if he have not money enough to keep up the property house land and dollar must go together quite so well sir henry i be of one mind with you a to the advisability of your go down to devonshire without delay there be only one provision which i must make you certainly must not <go|get> alone dr mortimer return with me but dr mortimer have his practice to attend to and his <house|mansion> be mile away from yours with all the <goodwill|good_will> in the world he may be unable to help you no sir henry you must take with you someone a trusty man who will <be|follow> always by your side be it possible that you could <come|do> yourself mr holmes if matter come to a crisis i should endeavour to be present in person but you can understand that with my extensive consult <practice|commit> and with the constant appeal which reach me from many quarter it <be|follow> impossible for me to be absent from london for an indefinite time at the present <instant|instantaneous> <one|i> of the most revere name in england be be besmirch by a blackmailer and <only|merely> i can stop a disastrous scandal you will see how <impossible|inconceivable> it be for me to go to dartmoor whom would you recommend then holmes lay his hand upon my arm if my friend would undertake it there be no man who be better worth have at your side when you be in a tight place no one can say so more confidently than i the proposition <take|consider> me completely by surprise but before i <have|make> time to answer baskerville <seize|assume> me by the hand and wring it heartily well <now|immediately> that be <real|tangible> kind of you dr watson say he you see how it be with me and you know <just|simply> a much about the matter a i do if you <will|leave> come down to baskerville <hall|mansion> and see me through i'll never forget it the promise of adventure have always a fascination for me and <i|single> be compliment by the word of holmes and by the eagerness with which the baronet hail me a a <companion|associate> i will <come|get> with pleasure say i i do not know how i could employ my time better and you will report very carefully to me say holmes when a crisis come a it will do i will direct how you shall act i suppose that by saturday all might be ready would that suit dr watson perfectly then on saturday unless you hear to the contrary we shall <meet|see> at the ten thirty train from paddington we have rise to depart when baskerville give a cry of triumph and dive into one of the corner of the room he draw a brown boot from under a cabinet my miss boot he cry may all our difficulty vanish a easily say sherlock holmes but it <be|follow> a very singular <thing|matter> dr mortimer remark i search this room carefully before lunch and so do i say baskerville every <inch|edge> of it there be certainly no boot in it then in that <case|slip> the waiter must have place it there while we be lunch the german be send for but profess to know nothing of the matter nor could any inquiry clear it up another item have be add to that <constant|perpetual> and apparently purposeless series of small mystery which have succeed each other so rapidly set aside the whole grim story of sir charles's death we <have|take> a <line|channel> of inexplicable <incident|incidental> all within the limit of two day which include the receipt of the <print|impress> letter the black beard spy in the hansom the loss of the new brown boot the loss of the <old|previous> black boot and now the <return|deliver> of the new brown boot holmes sit in silence in the cab a we drive

knee and his forehead sink forward upon his hand in deep <think|guess> <i|single> stand dumb with astonishment watch him from the darkness a small taper on the edge of the table shed a feeble light which suffice to show me that he be fully dress suddenly a i look he rise from his chair and walk over to a bureau at the side he unlock it and draw out one of the drawer from this he take a paper and return to his seat he flatten it out beside the taper on the edge of the table and begin to study it with minute attention my indignation at this calm examination of our family document overcome me so far that i take a step forward and brunton look up saw me stand in the doorway he spring to his foot his face <turn|round> livid with fear and he thrust into his breast the chart like paper which he have be originally study so say i this be how you repay the trust which we have repose in you you will leave my service to morrow 'he bow with the <look|spirit> of a man who be utterly crush and slink

it be nothing of any importance at all but <simply|merely> a copy of the question and answer in the singular old observance call the musgrave ritual it be a <sort|form> of ceremony peculiar to our family which each musgrave for century past have go through on his come of age a <thing|affair> of private interest and perhaps of some little importance to the archaeologist like our own <blazon|blazonry> and <charge|accusation> but of no practical use whatever 'we have better come back to the paper afterwards say i 'if you think it really necessary he <answer|do> with some hesitation 'to continue my statement however i relocked the bureau use the key which brunton have leave and i have turn to go when i be surprise to find that the butler have return and be stand before me mr

<begin|get> to suspect that her brain be affect i be strong enough mr musgrave say she we will <see|realize> what the doctor say i answer you must stop work now and when you go downstairs just say that i wish to see brunton the butler be go say she <go|run> go where he be go no <one|nonpareil> have see him he be not in his room oh yes he be go he be go she fell back against the wall with shriek after <shriek|shrill> of laughter while i horrify at this sudden hysterical attack <rush|stimulate> to the bell to summon help the girl be take to her room still scream and sob while i make inquiry about brunton there be no doubt about it that he have disappear his bed have not be sleep in he have be see by no one since he have retire to his room the night before and yet it be difficult to see how he could <have|take> leave the house a both window and door be find to be fasten in the morning his clothe his watch and even his money be in his room but the black suit which he usually <wear|assume> be miss his slipper too be go but his <boot|kick> be leave behind where then could butler brunton have go in the night and what could have become of him now 'of course we search the <house|mansion> from cellar to garret but there be no trace of him it be a i <have|let> say a labyrinth of an old house especially the original wing which be <now|instantly> practically uninhabited but we ransack every room and cellar without discover the least <sign|subscribe> of the miss man it <be|follow> incredible to me that he could have <go|fling> away leave all his property behind him and yet where could he be <i|single> call in the local <police|law> but without success rain have fall on the night before and we examine the lawn and the path all round the <house|household> but in vain matter be in this state when a new <development|growth> <quite|rather> draw our attention away from the original mystery 'for two day rachel howells <have|get> be so ill sometimes delirious sometimes hysterical that a nurse have be employ to sit up with her at night on the third night after brunton's disappearance the nurse <find|get> her patient sleep nicely have drop into a nap in the armchair when she wake in the early morning to <find|get> the bed empty the window open and no sign of the invalid i <be|follow> instantly arouse and with the two footman <start|get> off at once in search of the miss <girl|fille> it be not difficult to tell the direction which she have take for start from under her window we could follow her footmark easily across the lawn to the edge of the mere where they vanish close to the gravel path which lead out of the ground the lake there be eight foot deep and you can imagine our feel when we saw that the trail of the poor demented girl come to an <end|destruction> at the edge of it 'of <course|row> we have the drag at once and set to work to recover the remain but no <trace|line> of the body could we find on the other hand we bring to the surface an object of a most unexpected kind it be a linen bag which contain within it a mass of old <rust|eat> and discolour metal and several dull colour piece of pebble or glass this strange <find|discover> be all that we could get from the mere and although we <make|realize> every possible search and inquiry yesterday we know nothing of the fate either of rachel howells or of richard brunton the county police be at their wits' end and i have come up to you a a last resource you can imagine watson with what <eagerness|readiness> i listen to this extraordinary sequence of <event|issue> and endeavour to piece them together and to <devise|organize> some common thread upon which they might all hang the butler be <go|fling> the maid be go the maid <have|let> love the butler but have afterwards have cause to hate him she be of welsh <blood|line> fiery and passionate she have be terribly excite immediately after his disappearance she have fling into the lake a bag contain some curious content these be all factor which have to be take into consideration and yet none of them <get|obtain> quite to the heart of the matter what be the start point of this chain of event there lay the end of this tangle line 'i must <see|realize> that paper musgrave say i 'which this butler of yours think it worth his while to consult <even|yet> at the <risk|chance> of the loss of his place 'it be rather an absurd <business|concern> this <ritual|rite> of ours he answer 'but it have at least the save grace of antiquity to excuse it i have a copy of the question and <answer|result> here if you care to run your eye over them he hand me the very paper which i have here watson and this be the strange catechism to which each musgrave have to submit when he come to man's estate i will <read|take> you the question and answer a they stand 'whose be it 'his who be go 'who shall have it 'he who will come 'where be the sun 'over the oak 'where be the shadow 'under the elm how <be|follow> it step 'north by ten and by <ten|decade> east by five and by five south by two and by two west by one and by one and <so|then> under 'what shall we give for it 'all that be ours 'why should we give it 'for the sake of the trust 'the original <have|let> no date but be in the spell of the middle of the seventeenth century remark musgrave 'i be afraid however that it can <be|follow> of little help to you in solve this mystery 'at least say i 'it give u another mystery and one which be even more interest than the <first|low> it may be that the solution of the one may prove to be the solution of the other you will excuse me musgrave if i say that your butler appear to me to have be a very clever <man|human> and to <have|let> have a clearer insight than ten generation of his master 'i hardly <follow|be> you say musgrave 'the paper seem to me to be of no practical importance 'but to me it seem immensely practical and i fancy that brunton take the same view he have probably see it before that night on which you catch him 'it be <very|really> possible we take no pain to hide it 'he <simply|plainly> wish i should imagine to refresh his <memory|store> upon that last occasion he have a i <understand|see> some sort of <map|represent> or chart which he be compare with the manuscript and which he thrust into his pocket when you appear 'that be true but what could he have to do with this old family custom of ours and what do this rigmarole mean 'i don't think that we should have much difficulty in determine that say i 'with your permission we will take the first train down to sussex and <go|get> a little more deeply into the matter upon the spot the same afternoon saw u both at hurlstone <possibly|maybe> you <have|get> <see|realize> picture and read description of the famous old build so i will <confine|enclose> my account of it to say that it be <build|make> in the shape of an l the long <arm|branch> be the more modern portion and the shorter the ancient nucleus from which the other have develop over the <low|humble> heavily lintelled door in the centre of this old part <be|follow> chisel the date but expert be agree that the beam and stonework be really much older than this the enormously thick wall and tiny window of this part have in the last century drive the family into <build|make> the new wing and the old one be use now a a storehouse and a cellar when it be use at all a splendid park with fine old timber surround the house and the lake to which my client have refer lay <close|closely> to the avenue about two hundred yard from the <build|frame> i be already firmly convince watson that there be not three separate mystery here but one <only|just> and that if i could <read|say> the musgrave ritual <aright|right> i should hold in my hand the clue which would lead me to the truth concern both the butler brunton and the maid howells to that <then|so> i <turn|go> all my energy why should this servant be so <anxious|nervous> to master this old formula evidently because he saw something in it which have escape all those generation of country squire and from which he expect some personal advantage what be it then and how have it affect his <fate|lot> it be perfectly obvious to me on read the ritual that the measurement must refer to some spot to which the rest of the document allude and that if we could find that spot we should be in a <fair|reasonable> way towards find what the secret be which the <old|former> musgraves have <think|remember> it necessary to embalm in so curious a fashion there be two guide give u to start with an oak and an elm a to the oak there could be no <question|interrogate> at all right in front of the house upon the leave hand side of the <drive|crusade> there stand a patriarch among oak one of the <most|nearly> <magnificent|glorious> tree that i have ever see 'that be there when your ritual be draw up say i a we drive past it 'it be there at the norman conquest in all probability he answer 'it have a girth of twenty three foot 'have you any old elm i ask 'there use to <be|follow> a very old one over yonder but it be strike by lightning ten year ago and we cut down the stump 'you can see where it use to be 'oh yes 'there be no other elm 'no old one but plenty of beech 'i should like to <see|realize> where it grow we <have|get> drive up in a dog cart and my client lead me away at once without our enter the <house|firm> to the scar on the lawn where the elm have stand it be nearly midway between the oak and the house my investigation seem to be progress 'i <suppose|say> it be impossible to find out how high the elm be i ask 'i can give you it at once it be sixty four foot 'how do you come to know it i ask in surprise 'when my old tutor <use|function> to <give|make> me an exercise in trigonometry it always take the shape of measure height when i be a lad i work out every tree and build in the estate this be an unexpected piece of luck my data be come more quickly than i could have reasonably <hop|skip> 'tell me i ask 'did your butler ever <ask|expect> you such a question reginald musgrave look at me in <astonishment|amazement> 'now that you call it to my mind he answer 'brunton _did_ <ask|expect> me <about|around> the height of the tree some month ago in connection with some little <argument|statement> with the groom this be excellent news watson for it show me that i be on the right road i look up at the <sun|sunshine> it be <low|small> in the heaven and i calculate that in le than an hour it would lie just above the topmost branch of the old oak one condition <mention|remark> in the <ritual|rite> would then be fulfil and the <shadow|phantom> of the elm must mean the farther <end|finish> of the shadow otherwise the trunk would have be choose a the guide i have then to find where the far end of the shadow would fall when the sun be just clear of the oak that must have be difficult holmes when the elm be no longer there well at least i know that if brunton could do it i could <also|too> besides there be no real difficulty i go with musgrave to his study and whittle myself this peg to which i tie this long string with a knot at each yard then i <take|make> two length of a <fish|angle> rod which <come|get> to <just|exactly> six foot and i go back with my client to where the elm have be the <sun|sunshine> <be|follow> just graze the top of the oak i fasten the rod on end mark out the <direction|guidance> of the shadow and <measure|beat> it it be nine <foot|infantry> in length of course the calculation now be a simple one if a rod of six foot <throw|shed> a shadow of nine a tree of sixty four foot would throw one of ninety six and the line of the one would of course be the <line|stock> of the other <i|single> measure out the distance which bring me almost to the wall of the <house|family> and i thrust a peg into the spot you can imagine my exultation watson when within two <inch|edge> of my peg i saw a conical depression in the grind i know that it be the mark make by brunton in his measurement and that i be still upon his <trail|chase> from this start <point|show> i proceed to step <have|take> first take the cardinal point by my pocket compass ten step with each <foot|hoof> <take|consider> me along parallel with the wall of the house and again i <mark|stain> my spot with a peg then i carefully pace off five to the east and two to the south it bring me to the <very|really> threshold of the old <door|doorway> two <step|abuse> to the west mean now that i be to go two <pace|rate> down the stone flag passage and this be the place indicate by the ritual never have i felt such a cold chill of disappointment watson for a <moment|import> it seem to me that there must be some radical mistake in my calculation the <set|localize> sun shine full upon the passage <floor|deck> and i could see that the old <foot|base> wear grey stone with which it <be|follow> pave be firmly cement together and have certainly not be <move|movement> for many a <long|tenacious> year brunton have not be at work here i tap upon the floor but it <sound|go> the same all over and there be no sign of any crack or <crevice|chap> but fortunately musgrave who have <begin|get> to appreciate the mean of my proceed and who be now a excite a myself <take|assume> out his manuscript to check my calculation 'and under he cry 'you <have|give> omit the and under i <have|give> think that it mean that we be to <dig|digging> but now of course i saw at once that i be wrong 'there be a cellar under this then i cry 'yes and a <old|older> a the house down here through this door we go down a wind stone stair and my <companion|accompany> strike a match light a large lantern which stand on a barrel in the corner in an instant it be obvious that we have at last come upon the <true|reliable> place and that we have not be the only people to visit the spot recently it have be use for the <storage|store> of wood but the billet which have evidently <be|follow> litter over the floor <be|follow> now pile at the side so a to <leave|give> a clear space in the middle in this space lay a large and heavy flagstone with a <rust|rusty> iron ring in the centre to which a thick shepherd's check muffler be attach 'by jove cry my client that s brunton's muffler i have see it on him and could swear to it what have the villain be do here at my <suggestion|proffer> a couple of the county police be summon to be present and i then endeavour to raise the stone by pull on the cravat i could only move it slightly and it be with the aid of one of the constable that i succeed at <last|lowest> in carry it to one side a black hole yawn beneath into which we all peer while musgrave kneel at the <side|incline> push down the lantern a small chamber about seven foot deep and four <foot|infantry> square lay open to u at one side of this <be|follow> a squat brass <bind|bond> wooden box the lid of which be hinge upwards with this curious old fashion key project from the lock it be then that i write and send the paper to you mr holmes it be not a <thing|matter> that i could <take|get> to the police for they would have laugh at me but you will tell me what to do i be not a rich man but if there be any danger threaten my little woman i would spend my <last|final> copper to shield her he be a fine creature this <man|gentleman> of the old english soil simple straight and gentle with his great earnest blue eye and broad comely face his love for his wife and his trust in her <shine|glint> in his feature holmes have listen to his story with the utmost attention and now he sit for some time in silent think don't you think mr cubitt say he at last that your best plan would be to make a direct <appeal|charm> to your wife and to ask her to share her <secret|mysterious> with you hilton cubitt shake his massive head a promise be a <promise|anticipate> mr holmes if elsie wish to tell me she would if not it be not for me to force her confidence but <i|single> be justify in take my own line and i will then i will help you with all my heart in the first place have you hear of <any|whatever> stranger be <see|consider> in your neighbourhood no i <presume|assume> that it be a very quiet place any fresh <face|side> would cause comment in the immediate neighbourhood yes but we have several small water <place|point> not very far away and the farmer take in lodger these hieroglyphic have evidently a mean if it be a purely arbitrary one it may be impossible for u to solve it if on the other <hand|paw> it be systematic i have no doubt that we shall <get|go> to the bottom of it but this particular sample be so short that i can do nothing and the fact which you have bring me be so indefinite that we have no basis for an investigation i would suggest that you return to norfolk that you <keep|save> a keen look out and that you take an exact copy of any fresh dance men which may appear it be a thousand pity that we have not a reproduction of those which be do in chalk upon the window sill make a discreet inquiry also a to any <stranger|alien> in the neighbourhood when you have collect some fresh evidence come to me again that be the best advice which i can give you mr hilton cubitt if there be any press <fresh|new> development i shall be always ready to run down and see you in your norfolk home the interview leave sherlock holmes very thoughtful and several time in the next few day i saw him take his slip of <paper|composition> from his note book and look long and earnestly at the curious figure inscribe upon it he make no allusion to the <affair|intimacy> however until one afternoon a fortnight or so later i be go out when he call me back you have better stay here watson why because i have a <wire|telegram> from hilton cubitt this morning you remember hilton cubitt of the dance men he be to reach liverpool street at one twenty he may be here at any moment i gather from his wire that there <have|get> be some new incident of importance we have not long to wait for our norfolk squire come <straight|directly> from the station a fast a a hansom could bring him he be look worry and depress with <tire|fag> eye and a line forehead it's get on my nerve this business mr holmes say he a he <sink|settle> like a weary man into an arm chair it's bad enough to feel that you be surround by <unseen|unobserved> unknown folk who have some kind of design upon you but when in addition to that you <know|recognize> that it <be|follow> just kill your wife by inch then it become a much a flesh and blood can endure she's wear away under it just wear away before my eye have she say anything yet no mr holmes she have not and yet there <have|take> be time when the poor girl <have|let> want to speak and yet could not quite <bring|add> herself to take the plunge i have try to help her but i dare say i do it clumsily and scar her off from it she have speak <about|near> my old family and our reputation in the county and our pride in our unsullied honour and i always felt it be <lead|take> to the point but somehow it turn off before we get there but you have find out something for yourself a good deal mr holmes i <have|give> <several|various> fresh dance men picture for you to examine and what be more important i <have|make> <see|find> the fellow what the man who draw them yes i <saw|find> him at his work but i will tell you everything in order when i <get|develop> back after my <visit|gossip> to you the very <first|low> thing i saw next morning be a <fresh|new> crop of dance men they have <be|follow> draw in chalk upon the black wooden door of the tool house which stand beside the lawn in full view of the front window i <take|get> an exact copy and here it be he unfold a paper and lay it upon the <table|board> here be a copy of the hieroglyphic graphic excellent say holmes excellent pray continue when i have take the copy i rub out the mark but two morning later a fresh inscription have appear i have a copy of it here graphic holmes rub his hand and chuckle with delight our material be rapidly accumulate say he three day <later|late> a message be leave scrawl upon paper and place under a pebble upon the <sun|sunlight> dial here it be the character be a you <see|find> exactly the same a the last one after that i determine to lie in wait <so|therefore> <i|single> get out my revolver and i sit up in my <study|report> which overlook the lawn and garden about two in the <morning|dawn> i be seat by the window all be dark save for the moonlight outside when i hear step behind me and there be my wife in her dress gown she implore me to come to bed i tell her frankly that i wish to see who it be who play such absurd trick upon u she answer that it <be|follow> some senseless practical joke and that i should not take any notice of it 'if it really annoy you hilton we might go and travel you and i and so avoid this <nuisance|pain> 'what be drive out of our own <house|mansion> by a practical joker say i 'why we should <have|make> the <whole|solid> county laugh at u 'well <come|amount> to bed say she 'and we can discus it in the <morning|daybreak> suddenly a she speak i saw her white face grow <whiter|snowy> yet in the moonlight and her hand tighten upon my shoulder something be <move|go> in the shadow of the tool house i <saw|ensure> a dark creep figure which crawl round the corner and squat in <front|movement> of the <door|doorway> seize my pistol i be rush out when my wife throw her <arm|branch> round me and hold me with convulsive <strength|posture> i try to throw her off but she cling to me <most|nearly> desperately at last i get clear but by the time i have open the door and reach the house the creature be go he have <leave|allow> a trace of his presence however for there on the door be the very same arrangement of dance men which have already twice appear and which i have copy on that paper there be no other sign of the fellow anywhere though i run all over the ground and <yet|however> the <amaze|astonish> thing be that he must have be there all the time for when i examine the <door|threshold> again in the morning he have scrawl some more of his picture under the line which i have already see have you that fresh draw yes it <be|follow> very short but i make a copy of it and here it be again he produce a paper the new dance be in this form <graphic|vivid> tell me say holmes and i could <see|realize> by his <eye|centre> that he be much excite be this a mere addition to the first or do it appear to <be|follow> entirely separate it be on a different panel of the door excellent this be far the most <important|significant> of all for our purpose it fill me with hop now mr hilton cubitt please continue your most interest statement i have nothing more to say mr holmes except that i be angry with my wife that night for <have|make> hold me back when i might <have|make> catch the skulk rascal she say that she fear that i might come to harm for an instant it have cross my <mind|listen> that <perhaps|maybe> what she really fear be that he might come to harm for i could not doubt that she know who this man be and what he mean by these strange signal but there be a tone in my wife's voice mr holmes and a <look|front> in her <eye|centre> which forbid doubt and i be sure that it be indeed my own safety that be in her mind there's the whole case and now i want your advice a to what i ought to do my own inclination be to put half a dozen of my farm <lad|fellow> in the shrubbery and when this fellow <come|fare> again to give him such a hide that he will leave u in peace for the future i fear it be too <deep|rich> a case for such simple remedy say holmes how long can you stay in london i must go back to <day|daylight> i would not leave my wife alone all night for anything she be <very|really> nervous and beg me to come back i dare say you be right but if you could have stop i might possibly have be able to return with you in a day or two meanwhile you will leave me these paper and i think that it be very likely that i shall be able to pay you a visit shortly and to <throw|have> some light upon your case sherlock holmes preserve his <calm|steady> professional manner until our visitor have leave u although it be easy for me who know him so well to see that he be profoundly excite the <moment|import> that hilton cubitt's broad back have disappear through the door my comrade rush to the table <lay|repose> out all the slip of paper contain dance men in <front|face> of him and throw himself into an intricate and elaborate calculation for two hour i watch him a he cover <sheet|sail> after sheet of paper with figure and letter so completely absorb in his task that he have evidently forget my <presence|front> sometimes he be <make|ready> progress and whistle and sing at his work sometimes he be puzzle and would sit for long spell with a <furrow|rut> brow and a vacant <eye|centre> finally he spring from his <chair|lead> with a cry of satisfaction and walk <up|upward> and down the room rub his hand together then he <write|pen> a long telegram upon a cable form if my answer to this be a i hope you will have a very pretty case to add to your collection watson say he i expect that we shall be able to go down to norfolk to morrow and to take our <friend|acquaintance> some very definite news a to the <secret|mystery> of his annoyance i confess that i <be|follow> fill with curiosity but i <be|follow> aware that holmes like to make his disclosure at his own time and in his own <way|style> so i <wait|expect> until it should suit him to take me into his confidence but there be a <delay|wait> in that answer telegram and two <day|daylight> of impatience follow during which holmes <prick|sting> up his ear at every ring of the bell on the even of the second there <come|do> a letter from hilton cubitt all be quiet with him save that a long inscription have appear that morning upon the pedestal of the sun dial he inclose a copy of it which be here reproduce graphic holmes bend over this grotesque frieze for some minute and then suddenly <spring|give> to his foot with an exclamation of surprise and dismay his face be haggard with anxiety we have let this affair go far enough say he be there a train to north walsham to night i turn up the time table the last have just <go|run> <then|so> we shall breakfast early and take the very first in the <morning|daybreak> say holmes our presence be most urgently <need|take> ah here be our expect <cablegram|overseas_telegram> one moment mr hudson there may be an answer no that be quite a i expect this message make it even more essential that we should not lose an hour in let hilton cubitt know how matter stand for it be a singular and a <dangerous|unsafe> web in which our simple norfolk squire be entangle so indeed it prove and a i come to the dark conclusion of a story which have seem to me to be only childish and bizarre i experience once again the <dismay|alarm> and horror with which i be <fill|take> would that i have some brighter end to communicate to my reader but these be the chronicle of fact and i must follow to their dark crisis the strange chain of <event|effect> which for some day make ridling thorpe manor a household word through the length and breadth of england we have hardly alight at north walsham and <mention|observe> the name of our destination when the station master hurry towards u i suppose that you be the <detective|investigator> from london say he a look of annoyance pas over holmes's face what make you think such a thing because inspector martin from norwich have just pas through but maybe you be the surgeon she's not <dead|idle> or wasn't by last account you may be in time to save her yet though it be for the gallows holmes's brow be dark with anxiety we be go to ridling thorpe manor say he but we have hear nothing of what have pas there it's a terrible business say the station master they be shoot both mr hilton cubitt and his wife she shoot him and then herself so the servant say he's dead and her life be despair of dear dear one of the oldest family in the county of norfolk and one of the most honour without a word holmes hurry to a <carriage|coach> and during the <long|tenacious> seven miles' drive he never <open|give> his mouth seldom have i see him so utterly despondent he have be uneasy during all our journey from town and i have observe that he have turn over the <morning|aurora> paper with anxious attention but <now|instantly> this sudden <realization|realisation> of his worst <fear|dread> leave him in a blank melancholy he lean back in his seat lose in gloomy <speculation|supposition> yet there be much around to <interest|pursuit> u for we be pas through a singular a country side a any in england where a few scatter cottage <represent|be> the population of to day while on every hand enormous square tower church bristle up from the flat green landscape and tell of the glory and prosperity of old east anglia at last the violet rim of the german ocean appear over the green edge of the norfolk coast and the driver point with his whip to two old brick and <timber|tone> gable which project from a grove of tree that's ridling thorpe manor say he a we drive up to the porticoed front door i observe in front of it beside the tennis lawn the black tool house and the pedestalled sun dial with which we have such strange association a dapper little man with a quick alert <manner|style> and a <wax|mount> moustache have just descend from a high dog cart he introduce himself a inspector martin of the norfolk constabulary and he be considerably astonish when he <hear|see> the name of my <companion|associate> why mr holmes the crime be only commit at three this morning how could you <hear|see> of it in london and <get|acquire> to the spot a soon a i i anticipate it i come in the hope of prevent it then you must have important evidence of which we be ignorant for they be say to be a most unite couple i have only the evidence of the dance <men|gentleman> say holmes i will explain the matter to you later meanwhile since it be too late to prevent this <tragedy|disaster> i be very anxious that i should use the knowledge which i posse in order to ensure that justice be <do|make> <will|leave> you associate me in your investigation or will you prefer that i should act independently i should be proud to feel that we be act together mr holmes say the inspector earnestly in that case i should be glad to hear the <evidence|demonstrate> and to examine the premise without an <instant|inst> of unnecessary <delay|stay> inspector martin have the good sense to allow my friend to do thing in his own fashion and <content|capacity> himself with carefully note the result the local surgeon an old white haired man <have|give> just come down from mr hilton cubitt's room and he report that her injury be serious but not necessarily fatal the <bullet|smoke> have pas through the front of her brain and it would probably be some time before she could regain consciousness on the question of whether she have <be|follow> <shoot|take> or have shoot herself he would not venture to express any decide <opinion|notion> certainly the <bullet|smoke> have <be|follow> <discharge|run> at very close quarter there <be|follow> only the one pistol find in the room two barrel of which have be empty mr hilton cubitt <have|get> be shoot through the heart it be equally conceivable that he have shoot her and then himself or that she <have|take> be the criminal for the revolver <lay|repose> upon the floor midway between them have he be move ask holmes we have move nothing except the lady we could not leave her <lie|consist> wound upon the floor how long <have|make> you be here doctor since four o'clock anyone else yes the constable here and you <have|take> touch nothing nothing you have act with great discretion who send for you the housemaid saunders be it she who give the alarm she and mr king the cook where be they now in the kitchen i believe then i <think|remember> we have <better|best> hear their story at <once|formerly> the <old|previous> hall oak panel and high windowed <have|get> be turn into a court of investigation holmes sit in a great old fashion chair his <inexorable|unappeasable> <eye|heart> gleam out of his <haggard|bony> face i could read in them a set <purpose|propose> to devote his life to this quest until the <client|customer> whom he have fail to save should at last be avenge the trim inspector martin the old grey head <country|area> doctor myself and a stolid village policeman make up the rest of that strange company the two woman tell their story clearly enough they have be arouse from their sleep by the sound of an explosion which <have|take> be follow a

and <watch|follow> the <cab|hack> drive away a i turn back my eye catch the pellet of paper which the prisoner have <toss|fling> upon the table it be the note with which holmes have decoy him see if you can read it watson say he with a smile it contain no word but this little line of dance men graphic if you use the code which i have explain say holmes you <will|leave> find that it <simply|only> mean 'come here at once i be convince that it be an invitation which he would not refuse since he could never imagine that it could come from anyone but the lady and so my dear watson we have end by <turn|twist> the dance men to good when they have so <often|frequently> be the agent of evil and i think that i have fulfil my promise of <give|break> you something unusual for your note book three forty be our <train|groom> and i fancy we should be back in baker street for dinner only one word of epilogue the american abe slaney be condemn to death at the winter assize at norwich but his penalty be change to penal servitude in consideration of mitigate circumstance and the certainty that hilton cubitt have fire the first shoot of mr hilton cubitt i <only|just> know that i have hear she recover entirely and that she still remain a widow devote her whole life to the care of the poor and to the administration of her husband's estate i have intend the adventure of the abbey grange to be the last of those exploit of my friend mr sherlock holmes which i should <ever|always> communicate to the public this resolution of mine <be|follow> not due to any lack of material since i have note of many hundred of case to which i <have|make> never allude nor <be|follow> it cause by any wan interest on the part of my reader in the <singular|remarkable> personality and unique method of this remarkable <man|world> the real reason lay in the reluctance which mr holmes have show to the continue publication of his experience so long a he be in actual professional practice the record of his success be of some practical value to him but since he have definitely retire from london and betaken himself to <study|consider> and bee farm on the sussex down notoriety have become hateful to him and he have peremptorily request that his wish in this matter should be strictly observe it <be|follow> only upon my <represent|play> to him that i have give a promise that the adventure of the second stain should be publish when the time be ripe and point out to him that it be only appropriate that this long series of episode should culminate in the most <important|significant> international case which he have ever be call upon to handle that i at last succeed in obtain his consent that a carefully guard account of the incident should at last be <lay|repose> before the public if in <tell|say> the <story|account> i seem to be <somewhat|pretty> vague in certain detail the <public|world> will readily <understand|realize> that there <be|follow> an excellent reason for my reticence it be then in a year and even in a decade that shall be nameless that upon one tuesday morning in autumn we <find|happen> two visitor of european fame within the wall of our humble <room|board> in baker street the one austere high nose eagle <eye|middle> and dominant be none other than the illustrious lord bellinger twice premier of britain the other dark clear cut and elegant hardly yet of middle <age|mature> and endow with every beauty of body and of mind be the right honourable trelawney <hope|desire> secretary for european affair and the most rise statesman in the <country|land> they sit side by side upon our paper litter settee and it be easy to see from their <wear|don> and anxious <face|aspect> that it be business of the <most|almost> press importance which have bring them the premier's thin blue vein hand be clasp tightly over the ivory head of his umbrella and his gaunt ascetic face look gloomily from holmes to me the european secretary pull nervously at his moustache and fidget with the seal of his watch <chain|strand> when i discover my <loss|release> mr holmes which be at eight o'clock this morning i at once inform the prime minister it be at his suggestion that we have both come to you have you inform the police no sir say the prime minister with the <quick|nimble> decisive manner for which he be <famous|notable> we have not do so nor be it possible that we should do so to inform the <police|constabulary> must in the long <run|streak> <mean|tight> to inform the public this be what we particularly desire to avoid and why sir because the document in question be of such immense importance that it publication might very easily i might almost say probably <lead|direct> to european complication of the utmost <moment|minute> it be not too much to say that peace or war may hang upon the <issue|cut> unless it recovery can be <attend|see> with the utmost <secrecy|privacy> <then|so> it may a <well|considerably> not be recover at all for all that be aim at by those who have take it be that it content should be generally know i understand <now|instantly> mr trelawney hope i should <be|follow> much oblige if you would tell me exactly the circumstance under which this document disappear that can be <do|come> in a very few word mr holmes the letter for it be a letter from a foreign potentate be receive six day ago it be of such importance that i have never <leave|will> it in my <safe|good> but i have take it across each even to my house in whitehall terrace and keep it in my <bedroom|chamber> in a <lock|operate> despatch box it be there last night of that i be certain i actually open the box while i be dress for dinner and saw the document inside this morning it <be|follow> go the despatch <box|corner> have stand beside the glass upon my dress table all night i be a light <sleeper|tie> and so be my wife we be both prepare to swear that no one could have enter the room during the night and yet i repeat that the paper be go what time do you dine half past seven how long be it before you go to bed my wife <have|get> <go|fling> to the theatre i <wait|expect> up for her it be half past eleven before we go to our room then for four hour the despatch <box|package> have lie unguarded no one be ever permit to enter that room save the housemaid in the morning and my valet or my wife's maid during the rest of the day they be both trusty servant who have be with u for some time besides neither of them could possibly have <know|bed> that there be anything more valuable than the ordinary departmental paper in my despatch box who do know of the existence of that letter no one in the house surely your wife know no sir i have say nothing to my wife until i miss the paper this morning the premier nod approvingly i have long know sir how high be your sense of public duty say he i <be|follow> convince that in the case of a secret of this importance it would rise superior to the most <intimate|internal> domestic tie the european secretary bow you do me no more than justice sir until this morning i have never breathe one word to my wife upon this matter could she have guess no mr holmes she could not have guess nor could anyone have guess have you lose any document before no sir who be there in england who do know of the <existence|universe> of this letter each member of the cabinet be inform of it yesterday but the pledge of secrecy which attend every cabinet <meet|fill> be increase by the <solemn|sober> warn which be give by the prime minister <good|upright> heaven to think that within a few hour i should myself have lose it his handsome face be distort with a spasm of despair and his hand tear at his hair for a moment we catch a glimpse of the natural <man|world> impulsive <ardent|fiery> keenly sensitive the next the aristocratic mask be replace and the gentle voice have return besides the member of the cabinet there be two or possibly three departmental official who know of the letter no one else in england mr holmes <i|single> assure you but abroad i believe that no <one|i> abroad have <see|discover> it save the man who write it i be well convince that his minister that the usual official channel have not be employ holmes consider for some little time now sir i must <ask|expect> you more particularly what this document be and why it disappearance should have such momentous consequence the two statesman exchange a quick glance and the premier's shaggy eyebrow gather in a frown mr holmes the envelope be a long thin one of pale blue colour there be a seal of red wax stamp with a crouch lion it be address in <large|big> bold handwrite to i fear sir say holmes that <interest|pastime> and indeed essential a these detail be my <inquiry|research> must <go|run> more to the root of thing what be the letter that be a state secret of the utmost importance and i fear that i cannot tell you nor do i see that it be necessary if by the aid of the power which you be say to posse you can find such an envelope a i describe with it enclosure you <will|leave> have deserve well of your <country|state> and earn any reward which it lie in our power to bestow sherlock holmes rise with a smile you be two of the most busy men in the country say he and in my own small way i <have|give> also a good many call upon me i regret exceedingly that i cannot <help|service> you in this matter and any continuation of this interview would be a waste of <time|sentence> the <premier|Prime_Minister> spring to his <foot|infantry> with that quick fierce gleam of his <deep|inscrutable> set eye before which a cabinet have cower i be not accustom sir he begin but master his anger and resume his seat for a minute or more we all sit in silence then the old statesman shrug his shoulder we must accept your <term|condition> mr holmes no doubt you be right and it be unreasonable for u to expect you to act unless we give you our entire confidence i agree with you sir say the younger statesman then i will tell you rely <entirely|completely> upon your honour and that of your colleague dr watson i may appeal to your patriotism also for i could not imagine a greater misfortune for the country than that this affair should come out you may safely trust u the letter then be from a certain foreign <potentate|dictator> who have be ruffle by some recent colonial development of this country it have be <write|save> hurriedly and upon his own responsibility entirely inquiry have show that his minister know nothing of the matter at the same time it be couch in so unfortunate a manner and certain phrase in it be of so provocative a character that it publication would undoubtedly <lead|go> to a <most|nearly> <dangerous|severe> <state|tell> of feel in this country there would be such a ferment sir that i do not hesitate to say that within a week of the publication of that letter this country would be involve in a great war holmes write a name upon a slip of paper and hand it to the <premier|prime_minister> exactly it be he and it be this letter this letter which may well mean the expenditure of a thousand million and the live of a hundred thousand <men|mankind> which have become lose in this unaccountable fashion <have|make> you inform the sender yes sir a cipher telegram have be despatch perhaps he desire the <publication|issue> of the letter no sir we have strong reason to <believe|consider> that he already understand that he have act in an indiscreet and hot head manner it would <be|follow> a <greater|big> blow to him and to his country than to u if this letter be to come out if this be so whose interest be it that the letter should come out why should anyone desire to steal it or to publish it there mr holmes you take me into region of high international politics but if you consider the european situation you will have no difficulty in perceive the motive the <whole|hale> of europe be an arm camp there be a double league which make a fair balance of military power great britain hold the <scale|plate> if britain be drive into war with one confederacy it would <assure|see> the supremacy of the other confederacy whether they join in the war or not do you follow very <clearly|distinctly> it be then the interest of the <enemy|foe> of this potentate to secure and publish this letter so a to make a breach between his country and ours yes sir and to whom would this document be send if it fell into the hand of an enemy to any of the great chancellery of europe it be probably speed on it way thither at the present instant a fast a steam can take it mr trelawney <hope|trust> drop his head on his chest and groan aloud the premier place his hand kindly upon his shoulder it be your misfortune my dear fellow no one can blame you there be no precaution which you have neglect now mr holmes you be in full possession of the fact what course do you recommend holmes shake his head mournfully you think sir that unless this document be recover there will be war i think it be very probable then sir prepare for war that be a hard say mr holmes <consider|see> the fact sir it be inconceivable that it be take after eleven thirty at night since i understand that mr hope and his wife be both in the room from that hour until the loss be <find|happen> out it be take then yesterday even between seven thirty and eleven thirty probably <near|about> the earlier hour since whoever take it evidently know that it <be|follow> there and would naturally secure it a early a possible now sir if a document of this importance be take at that hour where can it be now no <one|nonpareil> have any <reason|intellect> to retain it it have be pas rapidly on to those who <need|take> it what chance <have|let> we now to overtake or even to <trace|follow> it it be beyond our <reach|strain> the prime minister rise from the settee what you say be perfectly logical mr holmes i <feel|find> that the matter be indeed out of our hand let u presume for argument's <sake|interest> that the document <be|follow> <take|get> by the maid or by the valet they be both <old|former> and try servant <i|single> understand you to say that your room be on the second floor that there be no <entrance|catch> from without and that from within no one could go up unobserved it must then <be|follow> somebody in the house who have take it to whom would the thief take it to one of several international spy and secret agent whose name be tolerably familiar to me there be three who may be say to be the head of their profession i will begin my research by go round and <find|obtain> if each of them be at his post if one be miss especially if he <have|give> disappear since last night we will have some indication a to where the document have <go|run> why should he be miss <ask|expect> the european secretary he would take the letter to an embassy in london a likely a not <i|single> fancy not these agent work independently and their relation with the embassy be often strain
