["The intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the\ntime as \"The Styles Case\" has now somewhat subsided. Nevertheless, in\nview of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked,\nboth by my friend Poirot and the family themselves, to write an account\nof the whole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the\nsensational rumours which still persist.\n\nI will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my\nbeing connected with the affair.\n\nI had been invalided home from the Front; and, after spending some\nmonths in a rather depressing Convalescent Home, was given a month's\nsick leave. Having no near relations or friends, I was trying to make\nup my mind what to do, when I ran across John Cavendish. I had seen\nvery little of him for some years. Indeed, I had never known him\nparticularly well. He was a good fifteen years my senior, for one\nthing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. As a boy, though,\nI had often stayed at Styles, his mother's place in Essex.\n\nWe had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me\ndown to Styles to spend my leave there.\n\n\"The mater will be delighted to see you again--after all those years,\"\nhe added.\n\n\"Your mother keeps well?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, yes. I suppose you know that she has married again?\"\n\nI am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly. Mrs. Cavendish, who\nhad married John's father when he was a widower with two sons, had been\na handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her. She certainly could\nnot be a day less than seventy now. I recalled her as an energetic,\nautocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social\nnotoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady\nBountiful. She was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable\nfortune of her own.\n\nTheir country-place, Styles Court, had been purchased by Mr. Cavendish\nearly in their married life. He had been completely under his wife's\nascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her\nlifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that\nwas distinctly unfair to his two sons.", "Their step-mother, however, had\nalways been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the\ntime of their father's remarriage that they always thought of her as\ntheir own mother.\n\nLawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. He had qualified as a\ndoctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at\nhome while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any\nmarked success.\n\nJohn practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled\ndown to the more congenial life of a country squire. He had married two\nyears ago, and had taken his wife to live at Styles, though I\nentertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother\nto increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home\nof his own. Mrs. Cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her\nown plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this\ncase she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.\n\nJohn noticed my surprise at the news of his mother's remarriage and\nsmiled rather ruefully.\n\n\"Rotten little bounder too!\" he said savagely. \"I can tell you,\nHastings, it's making life jolly difficult for us. As for Evie--you\nremember Evie?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Oh, I suppose she was after your time. She's the mater's factotum,\ncompanion, Jack of all trades! A great sport--old Evie! Not precisely\nyoung and beautiful, but as game as they make them.\"\n\n\"You were going to say----?\"\n\n\"Oh, this fellow! He turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a\nsecond cousin or something of Evie's, though she didn't seem\nparticularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. The fellow is an\nabsolute outsider, anyone can see that. He's got a great black beard,\nand wears patent leather boots in all weathers! But the mater cottoned\nto him at once, took him on as secretary--you know how she's always\nrunning a hundred societies?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Well, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. No\ndoubt the fellow was very useful to her.", "But you could have knocked us\nall down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced\nthat she and Alfred were engaged! The fellow must be at least twenty\nyears younger than she is! It's simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but\nthere you are--she is her own mistress, and she's married him.\"\n\n\"It must be a difficult situation for you all.\"\n\n\"Difficult! It's damnable!\"\n\nThus it came about that, three days later, I descended from the train\nat Styles St. Mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason\nfor existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country\nlanes. John Cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out\nto the car.\n\n\"Got a drop or two of petrol still, you see,\" he remarked. \"Mainly\nowing to the mater's activities.\"\n\nThe village of Styles St. Mary was situated about two miles from the\nlittle station, and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it. It\nwas a still, warm day in early July. As one looked out over the flat\nEssex country, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it\nseemed almost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great\nwar was running its appointed course. I felt I had suddenly strayed\ninto another world. As we turned in at the lodge gates, John said:\n\n\"I'm afraid you'll find it very quiet down here, Hastings.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, that's just what I want.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. I drill\nwith the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms. My wife\nworks regularly 'on the land'. She is up at five every morning to milk,\nand keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. It's a jolly good life taking\nit all round--if it weren't for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp!\" He\nchecked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch. \"I wonder if we've\ntime to pick up Cynthia. No, she'll have started from the hospital by\nnow.\"\n\n\"Cynthia! That's not your wife?\"\n\n\"No, Cynthia is a protegee of my mother's, the daughter of an old\nschoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor.", "He came a\ncropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. My mother came\nto the rescue, and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. She\nworks in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster, seven miles away.\"\n\nAs he spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house.\nA lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed,\nstraightened herself at our approach.\n\n\"Hullo, Evie, here's our wounded hero! Mr. Hastings--Miss Howard.\"\n\nMiss Howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip. I had an\nimpression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face. She was a\npleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly\nin its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with\nfeet to match--these last encased in good thick boots. Her conversation,\nI soon found, was couched in the telegraphic style.\n\n\"Weeds grow like house afire. Can't keep even with 'em. Shall press you\nin. Better be careful.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful,\" I\nresponded.\n\n\"Don't say it. Never does. Wish you hadn't later.\"\n\n\"You're a cynic, Evie,\" said John, laughing. \"Where's tea to-day--inside\nor out?\"\n\n\"Out. Too fine a day to be cooped up in the house.\"\n\n\"Come on then, you've done enough gardening for to-day. 'The labourer\nis worthy of his hire', you know. Come and be refreshed.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Miss Howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, \"I'm\ninclined to agree with you.\"\n\nShe led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade\nof a large sycamore.\n\nA figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps to\nmeet us.\n\n\"My wife, Hastings,\" said John.\n\nI shall never forget my first sight of Mary Cavendish. Her tall,\nslender form, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of\nslumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful\ntawny eyes of hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman's\nthat I have ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed,\nwhich nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in\nan exquisitely civilised body--all these things are burnt into my\nmemory.", "I shall never forget them.\n\nShe greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear\nvoice, and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I\nhad accepted John's invitation. Mrs. Cavendish gave me some tea, and\nher few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a\nthoroughly fascinating woman. An appreciative listener is always\nstimulating, and I described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents\nof my Convalescent Home, in a way which, I flatter myself, greatly\namused my hostess. John, of course, good fellow though he is, could\nhardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.\n\nAt that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open French\nwindow near at hand:\n\n\"Then you'll write to the Princess after tea, Alfred? I'll write to\nLady Tadminster for the second day, myself. Or shall we wait until we\nhear from the Princess? In case of a refusal, Lady Tadminster might\nopen it the first day, and Mrs. Crosbie the second. Then there's the\nDuchess--about the school fete.\"\n\nThere was the murmur of a man's voice, and then Mrs. Inglethorp's rose\nin reply:\n\n\"Yes, certainly. After tea will do quite well. You are so thoughtful,\nAlfred dear.\"\n\nThe French window swung open a little wider, and a handsome\nwhite-haired old lady, with a somewhat masterful cast of features,\nstepped out of it on to the lawn. A man followed her, a suggestion of\ndeference in his manner.\n\nMrs. Inglethorp greeted me with effusion.\n\n\"Why, if it isn't too delightful to see you again, Mr. Hastings, after\nall these years. Alfred, darling, Mr. Hastings--my husband.\"\n\nI looked with some curiosity at \"Alfred darling\". He certainly struck a\nrather alien note. I did not wonder at John objecting to his beard. It\nwas one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen. He wore\ngold-rimmed pince-nez, and had a curious impassivity of feature. It\nstruck me that he might look natural on a stage, but was strangely out\nof place in real life. His voice was rather deep and unctuous. He\nplaced a wooden hand in mine and said:\n\n\"This is a pleasure, Mr.", "Hastings.\" Then, turning to his wife: \"Emily\ndearest, I think that cushion is a little damp.\"\n\nShe beamed fondly on him, as he substituted another with every\ndemonstration of the tenderest care. Strange infatuation of an\notherwise sensible woman!\n\nWith the presence of Mr. Inglethorp, a sense of constraint and veiled\nhostility seemed to settle down upon the company. Miss Howard, in\nparticular, took no pains to conceal her feelings. Mrs. Inglethorp,\nhowever, seemed to notice nothing unusual. Her volubility, which I\nremembered of old, had lost nothing in the intervening years, and she\npoured out a steady flood of conversation, mainly on the subject of the\nforthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place\nshortly. Occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of\ndays or dates. His watchful and attentive manner never varied. From the\nvery first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and I flatter\nmyself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd.\n\nPresently Mrs. Inglethorp turned to give some instructions about\nletters to Evelyn Howard, and her husband addressed me in his\npainstaking voice:\n\n\"Is soldiering your regular profession, Mr. Hastings?\"\n\n\"No, before the war I was in Lloyd's.\"\n\n\"And you will return there after it is over?\"\n\n\"Perhaps. Either that or a fresh start altogether.\"\n\nMary Cavendish leant forward.\n\n\"What would you really choose as a profession, if you could just\nconsult your inclination?\"\n\n\"Well, that depends.\"\n\n\"No secret hobby?\" she asked. \"Tell me--you're drawn to something?\nEveryone is--usually something absurd.\"\n\n\"You'll laugh at me.\"\n\nShe smiled.\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"Well, I've always had a secret hankering to be a detective!\"\n\n\"The real thing--Scotland Yard? Or Sherlock Holmes?\"\n\n\"Oh, Sherlock Holmes by all means. But really, seriously, I am awfully\ndrawn to it. I came across a man in Belgium once, a very famous\ndetective, and he quite inflamed me. He was a marvellous little fellow.\nHe used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of\nmethod. My system is based on his--though of course I have progressed\nrather further.", "He was a funny little man, a great dandy, but\nwonderfully clever.\"\n\n\"Like a good detective story myself,\" remarked Miss Howard. \"Lots of\nnonsense written, though. Criminal discovered in last chapter. Everyone\ndumbfounded. Real crime--you'd know at once.\"\n\n\"There have been a great number of undiscovered crimes,\" I argued.\n\n\"Don't mean the police, but the people that are right in it. The\nfamily. You couldn't really hoodwink them. They'd know.\"\n\n\"Then,\" I said, much amused, \"you think that if you were mixed up in a\ncrime, say a murder, you'd be able to spot the murderer right off?\"\n\n\"Of course I should. Mightn't be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers.\nBut I'm certain I'd know. I'd feel it in my fingertips if he came near\nme.\"\n\n\"It might be a 'she',\" I suggested.\n\n\"Might. But murder's a violent crime. Associate it more with a man.\"\n\n\"Not in a case of poisoning.\" Mrs. Cavendish's clear voice startled me.\n\"Dr. Bauerstein was saying yesterday that, owing to the general\nignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession,\nthere were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected.\"\n\n\"Why, Mary, what a gruesome conversation!\" cried Mrs. Inglethorp. \"It\nmakes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave. Oh, there's\nCynthia!\"\n\nA young girl in V.A.D. uniform ran lightly across the lawn.\n\n\"Why, Cynthia, you are late to-day. This is Mr. Hastings--Miss Murdoch.\"\n\nCynthia Murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life and\nvigour. She tossed off her little V.A.D. cap, and I admired the great\nloose waves of her auburn hair, and the smallness and whiteness of the\nhand she held out to claim her tea. With dark eyes and eyelashes she\nwould have been a beauty.\n\nShe flung herself down on the ground beside John, and as I handed her a\nplate of sandwiches she smiled up at me.\n\n\"Sit down here on the grass, do. It's ever so much nicer.\"\n\nI dropped down obediently.\n\n\"You work at Tadminster, don't you, Miss Murdoch?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"For my sins.\"", "\"Do they bully you, then?\" I asked, smiling.\n\n\"I should like to see them!\" cried Cynthia with dignity.\n\n\"I have got a cousin who is nursing,\" I remarked. \"And she is terrified\nof 'Sisters'.\"\n\n\"I don't wonder. Sisters _are_, you know, Mr. Hastings. They simp-ly\n_are_! You've no idea! But I'm not a nurse, thank heaven, I work in the\ndispensary.\"\n\n\"How many people do you poison?\" I asked, smiling.\n\nCynthia smiled too.\n\n\"Oh, hundreds!\" she said.\n\n\"Cynthia,\" called Mrs. Inglethorp, \"do you think you could write a few\nnotes for me?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Aunt Emily.\"\n\nShe jumped up promptly, and something in her manner reminded me that\nher position was a dependent one, and that Mrs. Inglethorp, kind as she\nmight be in the main, did not allow her to forget it.\n\nMy hostess turned to me.\n\n\"John will show you your room. Supper is at half-past seven. We have\ngiven up late dinner for some time now. Lady Tadminster, our Member's\nwife--she was the late Lord Abbotsbury's daughter--does the same. She\nagrees with me that one must set an example of economy. We are quite a\nwar household; nothing is wasted here--every scrap of waste paper, even,\nis saved and sent away in sacks.\"\n\nI expressed my appreciation, and John took me into the house and up the\nbroad staircase, which forked right and left half-way to different\nwings of the building. My room was in the left wing, and looked out\nover the park.\n\nJohn left me, and a few minutes later I saw him from my window walking\nslowly across the grass arm in arm with Cynthia Murdoch. I heard Mrs.\nInglethorp call \"Cynthia\" impatiently, and the girl started and ran\nback to the house. At the same moment, a man stepped out from the\nshadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction. He looked\nabout forty, very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face. Some\nviolent emotion seemed to be mastering him. He looked up at my window\nas he passed, and I recognized him, though he had changed much in the\nfifteen years that had elapsed since we last met.", "It was John's younger\nbrother, Lawrence Cavendish. I wondered what it was that had brought\nthat singular expression to his face.\n\nThen I dismissed him from my mind, and returned to the contemplation of\nmy own affairs.\n\nThe evening passed pleasantly enough; and I dreamed that night of that\nenigmatical woman, Mary Cavendish.\n\nThe next morning dawned bright and sunny, and I was full of the\nanticipation of a delightful visit.\n\nI did not see Mrs. Cavendish until lunch-time, when she volunteered to\ntake me for a walk, and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the\nwoods, returning to the house about five.\n\nAs we entered the large hall, John beckoned us both into the\nsmoking-room. I saw at once by his face that something disturbing had\noccurred. We followed him in, and he shut the door after us.\n\n\"Look here, Mary, there's the deuce of a mess. Evie's had a row with\nAlfred Inglethorp, and she's off.\"\n\n\"Evie? Off?\"\n\nJohn nodded gloomily.\n\n\"Yes; you see she went to the mater, and--Oh,--here's Evie herself.\"\n\nMiss Howard entered. Her lips were set grimly together, and she carried\na small suit-case. She looked excited and determined, and slightly on\nthe defensive.\n\n\"At any rate,\" she burst out, \"I've spoken my mind!\"\n\n\"My dear Evelyn,\" cried Mrs. Cavendish, \"this can't be true!\"\n\nMiss Howard nodded grimly.\n\n\"True enough! Afraid I said some things to Emily she won't forget or\nforgive in a hurry. Don't mind if they've only sunk in a bit. Probably\nwater off a duck's back, though. I said right out: 'You're an old\nwoman, Emily, and there's no fool like an old fool. The man's twenty\nyears younger than you, and don't you fool yourself as to what he\nmarried you for. Money! Well, don't let him have too much of it. Farmer\nRaikes has got a very pretty young wife. Just ask your Alfred how much\ntime he spends over there.' She was very angry. Natural! I went on,\n'I'm going to warn you, whether you like it or not. That man would as\nsoon murder you in your bed as look at you.", "He's a bad lot. You can say\nwhat you like to me, but remember what I've told you. He's a bad lot!'\"\n\n\"What did she say?\"\n\nMiss Howard made an extremely expressive grimace.\n\n\"'Darling Alfred'--'dearest Alfred'--'wicked calumnies' --'wicked\nlies'--'wicked woman'--to accuse her 'dear husband!' The sooner I left\nher house the better. So I'm off.\"\n\n\"But not now?\"\n\n\"This minute!\"\n\nFor a moment we sat and stared at her. Finally John Cavendish, finding\nhis persuasions of no avail, went off to look up the trains. His wife\nfollowed him, murmuring something about persuading Mrs. Inglethorp to\nthink better of it.\n\nAs she left the room, Miss Howard's face changed. She leant towards me\neagerly.\n\n\"Mr. Hastings, you're honest. I can trust you?\"\n\nI was a little startled. She laid her hand on my arm, and sank her\nvoice to a whisper.\n\n\"Look after her, Mr. Hastings. My poor Emily. They're a lot of\nsharks--all of them. Oh, I know what I'm talking about. There isn't one\nof them that's not hard up and trying to get money out of her. I've\nprotected her as much as I could. Now I'm out of the way, they'll\nimpose upon her.\"\n\n\"Of course, Miss Howard,\" I said, \"I'll do everything I can, but I'm\nsure you're excited and overwrought.\"\n\nShe interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger.\n\n\"Young man, trust me. I've lived in the world rather longer than you\nhave. All I ask you is to keep your eyes open. You'll see what I mean.\"\n\nThe throb of the motor came through the open window, and Miss Howard\nrose and moved to the door. John's voice sounded outside. With her hand\non the handle, she turned her head over her shoulder, and beckoned to\nme.\n\n\"Above all, Mr. Hastings, watch that devil--her husband!\"\n\nThere was no time for more. Miss Howard was swallowed up in an eager\nchorus of protests and good-byes. The Inglethorps did not appear.\n\nAs the motor drove away, Mrs. Cavendish suddenly detached herself from\nthe group, and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall\nbearded man who had been evidently making for the house.", "The colour\nrose in her cheeks as she held out her hand to him.\n\n\"Who is that?\" I asked sharply, for instinctively I distrusted the man.\n\n\"That's Dr. Bauerstein,\" said John shortly.\n\n\"And who is Dr. Bauerstein?\"\n\n\"He's staying in the village doing a rest cure, after a bad nervous\nbreakdown. He's a London specialist; a very clever man--one of the\ngreatest living experts on poisons, I believe.\"\n\n\"And he's a great friend of Mary's,\" put in Cynthia, the irrepressible.\n\nJohn Cavendish frowned and changed the subject.\n\n\"Come for a stroll, Hastings. This has been a most rotten business. She\nalways had a rough tongue, but there is no stauncher friend in England\nthan Evelyn Howard.\"\n\nHe took the path through the plantation, and we walked down to the\nvillage through the woods which bordered one side of the estate.\n\nAs we passed through one of the gates on our way home again, a pretty\nyoung woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and\nsmiled.\n\n\"That's a pretty girl,\" I remarked appreciatively.\n\nJohn's face hardened.\n\n\"That is Mrs. Raikes.\"\n\n\"The one that Miss Howard----\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said John, with rather unnecessary abruptness.\n\nI thought of the white-haired old lady in the big house, and that vivid\nwicked little face that had just smiled into ours, and a vague chill of\nforeboding crept over me. I brushed it aside.\n\n\"Styles is really a glorious old place,\" I said to John.\n\nHe nodded rather gloomily.\n\n\"Yes, it's a fine property. It'll be mine some day--should be mine now\nby rights, if my father had only made a decent will. And then I\nshouldn't be so damned hard up as I am now.\"\n\n\"Hard up, are you?\"\n\n\"My dear Hastings, I don't mind telling you that I'm at my wits' end\nfor money.\"\n\n\"Couldn't your brother help you?\"\n\n\"Lawrence? He's gone through every penny he ever had, publishing rotten\nverses in fancy bindings. No, we're an impecunious lot. My mother's\nalways been awfully good to us, I must say. That is, up to now. Since\nher marriage, of course----\" he broke off, frowning.", "For the first time I felt that, with Evelyn Howard, something\nindefinable had gone from the atmosphere. Her presence had spelt\nsecurity. Now that security was removed--and the air seemed rife with\nsuspicion. The sinister face of Dr. Bauerstein recurred to me\nunpleasantly. A vague suspicion of everyone and everything filled my\nmind. Just for a moment I had a premonition of approaching evil.\n\nI had arrived at Styles on the 5th of July. I come now to the events of\nthe 16th and 17th of that month. For the convenience of the reader I\nwill recapitulate the incidents of those days in as exact a manner as\npossible. They were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of\nlong and tedious cross-examinations.\n\nI received a letter from Evelyn Howard a couple of days after her\ndeparture, telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital in\nMiddlingham, a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away, and begging\nme to let her know if Mrs. Inglethorp should show any wish to be\nreconciled.\n\nThe only fly in the ointment of my peaceful days was Mrs. Cavendish's\nextraordinary, and, for my part, unaccountable preference for the\nsociety of Dr. Bauerstein. What she saw in the man I cannot imagine,\nbut she was always asking him up to the house, and often went off for\nlong expeditions with him. I must confess that I was quite unable to\nsee his attraction.\n\nThe 16th of July fell on a Monday. It was a day of turmoil. The famous\nbazaar had taken place on Saturday, and an entertainment, in connection\nwith the same charity, at which Mrs. Inglethorp was to recite a War\npoem, was to be held that night. We were all busy during the morning\narranging and decorating the Hall in the village where it was to take\nplace. We had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the\ngarden. I noticed that John's manner was somewhat unusual. He seemed\nvery excited and restless.\n\nAfter tea, Mrs. Inglethorp went to lie down to rest before her efforts\nin the evening and I challenged Mary Cavendish to a single at tennis.", "About a quarter to seven, Mrs. Inglethorp called us that we should be\nlate as supper was early that night. We had rather a scramble to get\nready in time; and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at\nthe door.\n\nThe entertainment was a great success, Mrs. Inglethorp's recitation\nreceiving tremendous applause. There were also some tableaux in which\nCynthia took part. She did not return with us, having been asked to a\nsupper party, and to remain the night with some friends who had been\nacting with her in the tableaux.\n\nThe following morning, Mrs. Inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast, as\nshe was rather overtired; but she appeared in her briskest mood about\n12.30, and swept Lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party.\n\n\"Such a charming invitation from Mrs. Rolleston. Lady Tadminster's\nsister, you know. The Rollestons came over with the Conqueror--one of\nour oldest families.\"\n\nMary had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with Dr.\nBauerstein.\n\nWe had a pleasant luncheon, and as we drove away Lawrence suggested\nthat we should return by Tadminster, which was barely a mile out of our\nway, and pay a visit to Cynthia in her dispensary. Mrs. Inglethorp\nreplied that this was an excellent idea, but as she had several letters\nto write she would drop us there, and we could come back with Cynthia\nin the pony-trap.\n\nWe were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter, until Cynthia\nappeared to vouch for us, looking very cool and sweet in her long white\noverall. She took us up to her sanctum, and introduced us to her fellow\ndispenser, a rather awe-inspiring individual, whom Cynthia cheerily\naddressed as \"Nibs.\"\n\n\"What a lot of bottles!\" I exclaimed, as my eye travelled round the\nsmall room. \"Do you really know what's in them all?\"\n\n\"Say something original,\" groaned Cynthia. \"Every single person who\ncomes up here says that. We are really thinking of bestowing a prize on\nthe first individual who does _not_ say: 'What a lot of bottles!' And I\nknow the next thing you're going to say is: 'How many people have you\npoisoned?'\"", "I pleaded guilty with a laugh.\n\n\"If you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone by\nmistake, you wouldn't joke about it. Come on, let's have tea. We've got\nall sorts of secret stories in that cupboard. No, Lawrence--that's the\npoison cupboard. The big cupboard--that's right.\"\n\nWe had a very cheery tea, and assisted Cynthia to wash up afterwards.\nWe had just put away the last tea-spoon when a knock came at the door.\nThe countenances of Cynthia and Nibs were suddenly petrified into a\nstern and forbidding expression.\n\n\"Come in,\" said Cynthia, in a sharp professional tone.\n\nA young and rather scared looking nurse appeared with a bottle which\nshe proffered to Nibs, who waved her towards Cynthia with the somewhat\nenigmatical remark:\n\n\"_I_'m not really here to-day.\"\n\nCynthia took the bottle and examined it with the severity of a judge.\n\n\"This should have been sent up this morning.\"\n\n\"Sister is very sorry. She forgot.\"\n\n\"Sister should read the rules outside the door.\"\n\nI gathered from the little nurse's expression that there was not the\nleast likelihood of her having the hardihood to retail this message to\nthe dreaded \"Sister\".\n\n\"So now it can't be done until to-morrow,\" finished Cynthia.\n\n\"Don't you think you could possibly let us have it to-night?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Cynthia graciously, \"we are very busy, but if we have time\nit shall be done.\"\n\nThe little nurse withdrew, and Cynthia promptly took a jar from the\nshelf, refilled the bottle, and placed it on the table outside the\ndoor.\n\nI laughed.\n\n\"Discipline must be maintained?\"\n\n\"Exactly. Come out on our little balcony. You can see all the outside\nwards there.\"\n\nI followed Cynthia and her friend and they pointed out the different\nwards to me. Lawrence remained behind, but after a few moments Cynthia\ncalled to him over her shoulder to come and join us. Then she looked at\nher watch.\n\n\"Nothing more to do, Nibs?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"All right. Then we can lock up and go.\"\n\nI had seen Lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon.", "Compared\nto John, he was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know. He was\nthe opposite of his brother in almost every respect, being unusually\nshy and reserved. Yet he had a certain charm of manner, and I fancied\nthat, if one really knew him well, one could have a deep affection for\nhim. I had always fancied that his manner to Cynthia was rather\nconstrained, and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him.\nBut they were both gay enough this afternoon, and chatted together like\na couple of children.\n\nAs we drove through the village, I remembered that I wanted some\nstamps, so accordingly we pulled up at the post office.\n\nAs I came out again, I cannoned into a little man who was just\nentering. I drew aside and apologised, when suddenly, with a loud\nexclamation, he clasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly.\n\n\"_Mon ami_ Hastings!\" he cried. \"It is indeed _mon ami_ Hastings!\"\n\n\"Poirot!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI turned to the pony-trap.\n\n\"This is a very pleasant meeting for me, Miss Cynthia. This is my old\nfriend, Monsieur Poirot, whom I have not seen for years.\"\n\n\"Oh, we know Monsieur Poirot,\" said Cynthia gaily. \"But I had no idea\nhe was a friend of yours.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Poirot seriously. \"I know Mademoiselle Cynthia. It\nis by the charity of that good Mrs. Inglethorp that I am here.\" Then,\nas I looked at him inquiringly: \"Yes, my friend, she had kindly\nextended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who, alas, are\nrefugees from their native land. We Belgians will always remember her\nwith gratitude.\"\n\nPoirot was an extraordinary looking little man. He was hardly more than\nfive feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity. His\nhead was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little\non one side. His moustache was very stiff and military. The neatness of\nhis attire was almost incredible. I believe a speck of dust would have\ncaused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified\nlittle man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his\ntime one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police.", "As a\ndetective, his _flair_ had been extraordinary, and he had achieved\ntriumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day.\n\nHe pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellow\nBelgians, and I promised to go and see him at an early date. Then he\nraised his hat with a flourish to Cynthia, and we drove away.\n\n\"He's a dear little man,\" said Cynthia. \"I'd no idea you knew him.\"\n\n\"You've been entertaining a celebrity unawares,\" I replied.\n\nAnd, for the rest of the way home, I recited to them the various\nexploits and triumphs of Hercule Poirot.\n\nWe arrived back in a very cheerful mood. As we entered the hall, Mrs.\nInglethorp came out of her boudoir. She looked flushed and upset.\n\n\"Oh, it's you,\" she said.\n\n\"Is there anything the matter, Aunt Emily?\" asked Cynthia.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Mrs. Inglethorp sharply. \"What should there be?\"\nThen catching sight of Dorcas, the parlourmaid, going into the\ndining-room, she called to her to bring some stamps into the boudoir.\n\n\"Yes, m'm.\" The old servant hesitated, then added diffidently: \"Don't\nyou think, m'm, you'd better get to bed? You're looking very tired.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you're right, Dorcas--yes--no--not now. I've some letters I must\nfinish by post-time. Have you lighted the fire in my room as I told\nyou?\"\n\n\"Yes, m'm.\"\n\n\"Then I'll go to bed directly after supper.\"\n\nShe went into the boudoir again, and Cynthia stared after her.\n\n\"Goodness gracious! I wonder what's up?\" she said to Lawrence.\n\nHe did not seem to have heard her, for without a word he turned on his\nheel and went out of the house.\n\nI suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and, Cynthia agreeing,\nI ran upstairs to fetch my racquet.\n\nMrs. Cavendish was coming down the stairs. It may have been my fancy,\nbut she, too, was looking odd and disturbed.\n\n\"Had a good walk with Dr. Bauerstein?\" I asked, trying to appear as\nindifferent as I could.\n\n\"I didn't go,\" she replied abruptly. \"Where is Mrs. Inglethorp?\"", "\"In the boudoir.\"\n\nHer hand clenched itself on the banisters, then she seemed to nerve\nherself for some encounter, and went rapidly past me down the stairs\nacross the hall to the boudoir, the door of which she shut behind her.\n\nAs I ran out to the tennis court a few moments later, I had to pass the\nopen boudoir window, and was unable to help overhearing the following\nscrap of dialogue. Mary Cavendish was saying in the voice of a woman\ndesperately controlling herself:\n\n\"Then you won't show it to me?\"\n\nTo which Mrs. Inglethorp replied:\n\n\"My dear Mary, it has nothing to do with that matter.\"\n\n\"Then show it to me.\"\n\n\"I tell you it is not what you imagine. It does not concern you in the\nleast.\"\n\nTo which Mary Cavendish replied, with a rising bitterness:\n\n\"Of course, I might have known you would shield him.\"\n\nCynthia was waiting for me, and greeted me eagerly with:\n\n\"I say! There's been the most awful row! I've got it all out of\nDorcas.\"\n\n\"What kind of a row?\"\n\n\"Between Aunt Emily and _him_. I do hope she's found him out at last!\"\n\n\"Was Dorcas there, then?\"\n\n\"Of course not. She 'happened to be near the door'. It was a real old\nbust-up. I do wish I knew what it was all about.\"\n\nI thought of Mrs. Raikes's gipsy face, and Evelyn Howard's warnings,\nbut wisely decided to hold my peace, whilst Cynthia exhausted every\npossible hypothesis, and cheerfully hoped, \"Aunt Emily will send him\naway, and will never speak to him again.\"\n\nI was anxious to get hold of John, but he was nowhere to be seen.\nEvidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon. I tried\nto forget the few words I had overheard; but, do what I would, I could\nnot dismiss them altogether from my mind. What was Mary Cavendish's\nconcern in the matter?\n\nMr. Inglethorp was in the drawing-room when I came down to supper. His\nface was impassive as ever, and the strange unreality of the man struck\nme afresh.\n\nMrs. Inglethorp came down last.", "She still looked agitated, and during\nthe meal there was a somewhat constrained silence. Inglethorp was\nunusually quiet. As a rule, he surrounded his wife with little\nattentions, placing a cushion at her back, and altogether playing the\npart of the devoted husband. Immediately after supper, Mrs. Inglethorp\nretired to her boudoir again.\n\n\"Send my coffee in here, Mary,\" she called. \"I've just five minutes to\ncatch the post.\"\n\nCynthia and I went and sat by the open window in the drawing-room. Mary\nCavendish brought our coffee to us. She seemed excited.\n\n\"Do you young people want lights, or do you enjoy the twilight?\" she\nasked. \"Will you take Mrs. Inglethorp her coffee, Cynthia? I will pour\nit out.\"\n\n\"Do not trouble, Mary,\" said Inglethorp. \"I will take it to Emily.\" He\npoured it out, and went out of the room carrying it carefully.\n\nLawrence followed him, and Mrs. Cavendish sat down by us.\n\nWe three sat for some time in silence. It was a glorious night, hot and\nstill. Mrs. Cavendish fanned herself gently with a palm leaf.\n\n\"It's almost too hot,\" she murmured. \"We shall have a thunderstorm.\"\n\nAlas, that these harmonious moments can never endure! My paradise was\nrudely shattered by the sound of a well known, and heartily disliked,\nvoice in the hall.\n\n\"Dr. Bauerstein!\" exclaimed Cynthia. \"What a funny time to come.\"\n\nI glanced jealously at Mary Cavendish, but she seemed quite\nundisturbed, the delicate pallor of her cheeks did not vary.\n\nIn a few moments, Alfred Inglethorp had ushered the doctor in, the\nlatter laughing, and protesting that he was in no fit state for a\ndrawing-room. In truth, he presented a sorry spectacle, being literally\nplastered with mud.\n\n\"What have you been doing, doctor?\" cried Mrs. Cavendish.\n\n\"I must make my apologies,\" said the doctor. \"I did not really mean to\ncome in, but Mr. Inglethorp insisted.\"\n\n\"Well, Bauerstein, you are in a plight,\" said John, strolling in from\nthe hall. \"Have some coffee, and tell us what you have been up to.\"\n\n\"Thank you, I will.\" He laughed rather ruefully, as he described how he\nhad discovered a very rare species of fern in an inaccessible place,\nand in his efforts to obtain it had lost his footing, and slipped\nignominiously into a neighbouring pond.", "\"The sun soon dried me off,\" he added, \"but I'm afraid my appearance is\nvery disreputable.\"\n\nAt this juncture, Mrs. Inglethorp called to Cynthia from the hall, and\nthe girl ran out.\n\n\"Just carry up my despatch-case, will you, dear? I'm going to bed.\"\n\nThe door into the hall was a wide one. I had risen when Cynthia did,\nJohn was close by me. There were therefore three witnesses who could\nswear that Mrs. Inglethorp was carrying her coffee, as yet untasted, in\nher hand.\n\nMy evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of Dr.\nBauerstein. It seemed to me the man would never go. He rose at last,\nhowever, and I breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\"I'll walk down to the village with you,\" said Mr. Inglethorp. \"I must\nsee our agent over those estate accounts.\" He turned to John. \"No one\nneed sit up. I will take the latch-key.\"\n\nTo make this part of my story clear, I append the following plan of the\nfirst floor of Styles. The servants' rooms are reached through the door\nB. They have no communication with the right wing, where the\nInglethorps' rooms were situated.\n\n\n\n\n       01\n\n\n\nIt seemed to be the middle of the night when I was awakened by Lawrence\nCavendish. He had a candle in his hand, and the agitation of his face\ntold me at once that something was seriously wrong.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" I asked, sitting up in bed, and trying to collect\nmy scattered thoughts.\n\n\"We are afraid my mother is very ill. She seems to be having some kind\nof fit. Unfortunately she has locked herself in.\"\n\n\"I'll come at once.\"\n\nI sprang out of bed; and, pulling on a dressing-gown, followed Lawrence\nalong the passage and the gallery to the right wing of the house.\n\nJohn Cavendish joined us, and one or two of the servants were standing\nround in a state of awe-stricken excitement. Lawrence turned to his\nbrother.\n\n\"What do you think we had better do?\"\n\nNever, I thought, had his indecision of character been more apparent.\n\nJohn rattled the handle of Mrs.", "Inglethorp's door violently, but with\nno effect. It was obviously locked or bolted on the inside. The whole\nhousehold was aroused by now. The most alarming sounds were audible\nfrom the interior of the room. Clearly something must be done.\n\n\"Try going through Mr. Inglethorp's room, sir,\" cried Dorcas. \"Oh, the\npoor mistress!\"\n\nSuddenly I realized that Alfred Inglethorp was not with us--that he\nalone had given no sign of his presence. John opened the door of his\nroom. It was pitch dark, but Lawrence was following with the candle,\nand by its feeble light we saw that the bed had not been slept in, and\nthat there was no sign of the room having been occupied.\n\nWe went straight to the connecting door. That, too, was locked or\nbolted on the inside. What was to be done?\n\n\"Oh, dear, sir,\" cried Dorcas, wringing her hands, \"what ever shall we\ndo?\"\n\n\"We must try and break the door in, I suppose. It'll be a tough job,\nthough. Here, let one of the maids go down and wake Baily and tell him\nto go for Dr. Wilkins at once. Now then, we'll have a try at the door.\nHalf a moment, though, isn't there a door into Miss Cynthia's rooms?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, but that's always bolted. It's never been undone.\"\n\n\"Well, we might just see.\"\n\nHe ran rapidly down the corridor to Cynthia's room. Mary Cavendish was\nthere, shaking the girl--who must have been an unusually sound\nsleeper--and trying to wake her.\n\nIn a moment or two he was back.\n\n\"No good. That's bolted too. We must break in the door. I think this\none is a shade less solid than the one in the passage.\"\n\nWe strained and heaved together. The framework of the door was solid,\nand for a long time it resisted our efforts, but at last we felt it\ngive beneath our weight, and finally, with a resounding crash, it was\nburst open.\n\nWe stumbled in together, Lawrence still holding his candle. Mrs.\nInglethorp was lying on the bed, her whole form agitated by violent\nconvulsions, in one of which she must have overturned the table beside\nher.", "As we entered, however, her limbs relaxed, and she fell back upon\nthe pillows.\n\nJohn strode across the room, and lit the gas. Turning to Annie, one of\nthe housemaids, he sent her downstairs to the dining-room for brandy.\nThen he went across to his mother whilst I unbolted the door that gave\non the corridor.\n\nI turned to Lawrence, to suggest that I had better leave them now that\nthere was no further need of my services, but the words were frozen on\nmy lips. Never have I seen such a ghastly look on any man's face. He\nwas white as chalk, the candle he held in his shaking hand was\nsputtering onto the carpet, and his eyes, petrified with terror, or\nsome such kindred emotion, stared fixedly over my head at a point on\nthe further wall. It was as though he had seen something that turned\nhim to stone. I instinctively followed the direction of his eyes, but I\ncould see nothing unusual. The still feebly flickering ashes in the\ngrate, and the row of prim ornaments on the mantelpiece, were surely\nharmless enough.\n\nThe violence of Mrs. Inglethorp's attack seemed to be passing. She was\nable to speak in short gasps.\n\n\"Better now--very sudden--stupid of me--to lock myself in.\"\n\nA shadow fell on the bed and, looking up, I saw Mary Cavendish standing\nnear the door with her arm around Cynthia. She seemed to be supporting\nthe girl, who looked utterly dazed and unlike herself. Her face was\nheavily flushed, and she yawned repeatedly.\n\n\"Poor Cynthia is quite frightened,\" said Mrs. Cavendish in a low clear\nvoice. She herself, I noticed, was dressed in her white land smock.\nThen it must be later than I thought. I saw that a faint streak of\ndaylight was showing through the curtains of the windows, and that the\nclock on the mantelpiece pointed to close upon five o'clock.\n\nA strangled cry from the bed startled me. A fresh access of pain seized\nthe unfortunate old lady. The convulsions were of a violence terrible\nto behold.", "Everything was confusion. We thronged round her, powerless\nto help or alleviate. A final convulsion lifted her from the bed, until\nshe appeared to rest upon her head and her heels, with her body arched\nin an extraordinary manner. In vain Mary and John tried to administer\nmore brandy. The moments flew. Again the body arched itself in that\npeculiar fashion.\n\nAt that moment, Dr. Bauerstein pushed his way authoritatively into the\nroom. For one instant he stopped dead, staring at the figure on the\nbed, and, at the same instant, Mrs. Inglethorp cried out in a strangled\nvoice, her eyes fixed on the doctor:\n\n\"Alfred--Alfred----\" Then she fell back motionless on the pillows.\n\nWith a stride, the doctor reached the bed, and seizing her arms worked\nthem energetically, applying what I knew to be artificial respiration.\nHe issued a few short sharp orders to the servants. An imperious wave\nof his hand drove us all to the door. We watched him, fascinated,\nthough I think we all knew in our hearts that it was too late, and that\nnothing could be done now. I could see by the expression on his face\nthat he himself had little hope.\n\nFinally he abandoned his task, shaking his head gravely. At that\nmoment, we heard footsteps outside, and Dr. Wilkins, Mrs. Inglethorp's\nown doctor, a portly, fussy little man, came bustling in.\n\nIn a few words Dr. Bauerstein explained how he had happened to be\npassing the lodge gates as the car came out, and had run up to the\nhouse as fast as he could, whilst the car went on to fetch Dr. Wilkins.\nWith a faint gesture of the hand, he indicated the figure on the bed.\n\n\"Ve--ry sad. Ve--ry sad,\" murmured Dr. Wilkins. \"Poor dear lady. Always\ndid far too much--far too much--against my advice. I warned her. Her\nheart was far from strong. 'Take it easy,' I said to her,\n'Take--it--easy'. But no--her zeal for good works was too great. Nature\nrebelled. Na--ture--re--belled.\"\n\nDr. Bauerstein, I noticed, was watching the local doctor narrowly.", "He\nstill kept his eyes fixed on him as he spoke.\n\n\"The convulsions were of a peculiar violence, Dr. Wilkins. I am sorry\nyou were not here in time to witness them. They were quite--tetanic in\ncharacter.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Dr. Wilkins wisely.\n\n\"I should like to speak to you in private,\" said Dr. Bauerstein. He\nturned to John. \"You do not object?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\nWe all trooped out into the corridor, leaving the two doctors alone,\nand I heard the key turned in the lock behind us.\n\nWe went slowly down the stairs. I was violently excited. I have a\ncertain talent for deduction, and Dr. Bauerstein's manner had started a\nflock of wild surmises in my mind. Mary Cavendish laid her hand upon my\narm.\n\n\"What is it? Why did Dr. Bauerstein seem so--peculiar?\"\n\nI looked at her.\n\n\"Do you know what I think?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Listen!\" I looked round, the others were out of earshot. I lowered my\nvoice to a whisper. \"I believe she has been poisoned! I'm certain Dr.\nBauerstein suspects it.\"\n\n\"_What?_\" She shrank against the wall, the pupils of her eyes dilating\nwildly. Then, with a sudden cry that startled me, she cried out: \"No,\nno--not that--not that!\" And breaking from me, fled up the stairs. I\nfollowed her, afraid that she was going to faint. I found her leaning\nagainst the bannisters, deadly pale. She waved me away impatiently.\n\n\"No, no--leave me. I'd rather be alone. Let me just be quiet for a\nminute or two. Go down to the others.\"\n\nI obeyed her reluctantly. John and Lawrence were in the dining-room. I\njoined them. We were all silent, but I suppose I voiced the thoughts of\nus all when I at last broke it by saying:\n\n\"Where is Mr. Inglethorp?\"\n\nJohn shook his head.\n\n\"He's not in the house.\"\n\nOur eyes met. Where _was_ Alfred Inglethorp? His absence was strange\nand inexplicable. I remembered Mrs. Inglethorp's dying words. What lay\nbeneath them? What more could she have told us, if she had had time?\n\nAt last we heard the doctors descending the stairs.", "Dr. Wilkins was\nlooking important and excited, and trying to conceal an inward\nexultation under a manner of decorous calm. Dr. Bauerstein remained in\nthe background, his grave bearded face unchanged. Dr. Wilkins was the\nspokesman for the two. He addressed himself to John:\n\n\"Mr. Cavendish, I should like your consent to a post-mortem.\"\n\n\"Is that necessary?\" asked John gravely. A spasm of pain crossed his\nface.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" said Dr. Bauerstein.\n\n\"You mean by that----?\"\n\n\"That neither Dr. Wilkins nor myself could give a death certificate\nunder the circumstances.\"\n\nJohn bent his head.\n\n\"In that case, I have no alternative but to agree.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Dr. Wilkins briskly. \"We propose that it should take\nplace to-morrow night--or rather to-night.\" And he glanced at the\ndaylight. \"Under the circumstances, I am afraid an inquest can hardly\nbe avoided--these formalities are necessary, but I beg that you won't\ndistress yourselves.\"\n\nThere was a pause, and then Dr. Bauerstein drew two keys from his\npocket, and handed them to John.\n\n\"These are the keys of the two rooms. I have locked them and, in my\nopinion, they would be better kept locked for the present.\"\n\nThe doctors then departed.\n\nI had been turning over an idea in my head, and I felt that the moment\nhad now come to broach it. Yet I was a little chary of doing so. John,\nI knew, had a horror of any kind of publicity, and was an easygoing\noptimist, who preferred never to meet trouble half-way. It might be\ndifficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan. Lawrence, on the\nother hand, being less conventional, and having more imagination, I\nfelt I might count upon as an ally. There was no doubt that the moment\nhad come for me to take the lead.\n\n\"John,\" I said, \"I am going to ask you something.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"You remember my speaking of my friend Poirot? The Belgian who is here?\nHe has been a most famous detective.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I want you to let me call him in--to investigate this matter.\"", "\"What--now? Before the post-mortem?\"\n\n\"Yes, time is an advantage if--if--there has been foul play.\"\n\n\"Rubbish!\" cried Lawrence angrily. \"In my opinion the whole thing is a\nmare's nest of Bauerstein's! Wilkins hadn't an idea of such a thing,\nuntil Bauerstein put it into his head. But, like all specialists,\nBauerstein's got a bee in his bonnet. Poisons are his hobby, so of\ncourse he sees them everywhere.\"\n\nI confess that I was surprised by Lawrence's attitude. He was so seldom\nvehement about anything.\n\nJohn hesitated.\n\n\"I can't feel as you do, Lawrence,\" he said at last. \"I'm inclined to\ngive Hastings a free hand, though I should prefer to wait a bit. We\ndon't want any unnecessary scandal.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" I cried eagerly, \"you need have no fear of that. Poirot is\ndiscretion itself.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, have it your own way. I leave it in your hands.\nThough, if it is as we suspect, it seems a clear enough case. God\nforgive me if I am wronging him!\"\n\nI looked at my watch. It was six o'clock. I determined to lose no time.\n\nFive minutes' delay, however, I allowed myself. I spent it in\nransacking the library until I discovered a medical book which gave a\ndescription of strychnine poisoning.\n\nThe house which the Belgians occupied in the village was quite close to\nthe park gates. One could save time by taking a narrow path through the\nlong grass, which cut off the detours of the winding drive. So I,\naccordingly, went that way. I had nearly reached the lodge, when my\nattention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me.\nIt was Mr. Inglethorp. Where had he been? How did he intend to explain\nhis absence?\n\nHe accosted me eagerly.\n\n\"My God! This is terrible! My poor wife! I have only just heard.\"\n\n\"Where have you been?\" I asked.\n\n\"Denby kept me late last night. It was one o'clock before we'd\nfinished. Then I found that I'd forgotten the latch-key after all. I\ndidn't want to arouse the household, so Denby gave me a bed.\"", "\"How did you hear the news?\" I asked.\n\n\"Wilkins knocked Denby up to tell him. My poor Emily! She was so\nself-sacrificing--such a noble character. She over-taxed her strength.\"\n\nA wave of revulsion swept over me. What a consummate hypocrite the man\nwas!\n\n\"I must hurry on,\" I said, thankful that he did not ask me whither I\nwas bound.\n\nIn a few minutes I was knocking at the door of Leastways Cottage.\n\nGetting no answer, I repeated my summons impatiently. A window above me\nwas cautiously opened, and Poirot himself looked out.\n\nHe gave an exclamation of surprise at seeing me. In a few brief words,\nI explained the tragedy that had occurred, and that I wanted his help.\n\n\"Wait, my friend, I will let you in, and you shall recount to me the\naffair whilst I dress.\"\n\nIn a few moments he had unbarred the door, and I followed him up to his\nroom. There he installed me in a chair, and I related the whole story,\nkeeping back nothing, and omitting no circumstance, however\ninsignificant, whilst he himself made a careful and deliberate toilet.\n\nI told him of my awakening, of Mrs. Inglethorp's dying words, of her\nhusband's absence, of the quarrel the day before, of the scrap of\nconversation between Mary and her mother-in-law that I had overheard,\nof the former quarrel between Mrs. Inglethorp and Evelyn Howard, and of\nthe latter's innuendoes.\n\nI was hardly as clear as I could wish. I repeated myself several times,\nand occasionally had to go back to some detail that I had forgotten.\nPoirot smiled kindly on me.\n\n\"The mind is confused? Is it not so? Take time, _mon ami_. You are\nagitated; you are excited--it is but natural. Presently, when we are\ncalmer, we will arrange the facts, neatly, each in his proper place. We\nwill examine--and reject. Those of importance we will put on one side;\nthose of no importance, pouf!\"--he screwed up his cherub-like face, and\npuffed comically enough--\"blow them away!\"\n\n\"That's all very well,\" I objected, \"but how are you going to decide\nwhat is important, and what isn't?", "That always seems the difficulty to\nme.\"\n\nPoirot shook his head energetically. He was now arranging his moustache\nwith exquisite care.\n\n\"Not so. _Voyons!_ One fact leads to another--so we continue. Does the\nnext fit in with that? _A merveille!_ Good! We can proceed. This next\nlittle fact--no! Ah, that is curious! There is something missing--a link\nin the chain that is not there. We examine. We search. And that little\ncurious fact, that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally,\nwe put it here!\" He made an extravagant gesture with his hand. \"It is\nsignificant! It is tremendous!\"\n\n\"Y--es----\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Poirot shook his forefinger so fiercely at me that I quailed\nbefore it. \"Beware! Peril to the detective who says: 'It is so small--it\ndoes not matter. It will not agree. I will forget it.' That way lies\nconfusion! Everything matters.\"\n\n\"I know. You always told me that. That's why I have gone into all the\ndetails of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or not.\"\n\n\"And I am pleased with you. You have a good memory, and you have given\nme the facts faithfully. Of the order in which you present them, I say\nnothing--truly, it is deplorable! But I make allowances--you are upset.\nTo that I attribute the circumstance that you have omitted one fact of\nparamount importance.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" I asked.\n\n\"You have not told me if Mrs. Inglethorp ate well last night.\"\n\nI stared at him. Surely the war had affected the little man's brain. He\nwas carefully engaged in brushing his coat before putting it on, and\nseemed wholly engrossed in the task.\n\n\"I don't remember,\" I said. \"And, anyway, I don't see----\"\n\n\"You do not see? But it is of the first importance.\"\n\n\"I can't see why,\" I said, rather nettled. \"As far as I can remember,\nshe didn't eat much. She was obviously upset, and it had taken her\nappetite away. That was only natural.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Poirot thoughtfully, \"it was only natural.\"\n\nHe opened a drawer, and took out a small despatch-case, then turned to\nme.", "\"Now I am ready. We will proceed to the chateau, and study matters on\nthe spot. Excuse me, _mon ami_, you dressed in haste, and your tie is\non one side. Permit me.\" With a deft gesture, he rearranged it.\n\n\"_Ca y est!_ Now, shall we start?\"\n\nWe hurried up the village, and turned in at the lodge gates. Poirot\nstopped for a moment, and gazed sorrowfully over the beautiful expanse\nof park, still glittering with morning dew.\n\n\"So beautiful, so beautiful, and yet, the poor family, plunged in\nsorrow, prostrated with grief.\"\n\nHe looked at me keenly as he spoke, and I was aware that I reddened\nunder his prolonged gaze.\n\nWas the family prostrated by grief? Was the sorrow at Mrs. Inglethorp's\ndeath so great? I realized that there was an emotional lack in the\natmosphere. The dead woman had not the gift of commanding love. Her\ndeath was a shock and a distress, but she would not be passionately\nregretted.\n\nPoirot seemed to follow my thoughts. He nodded his head gravely.\n\n\"No, you are right,\" he said, \"it is not as though there was a blood\ntie. She has been kind and generous to these Cavendishes, but she was\nnot their own mother. Blood tells--always remember that--blood tells.\"\n\n\"Poirot,\" I said, \"I wish you would tell me why you wanted to know if\nMrs. Inglethorp ate well last night? I have been turning it over in my\nmind, but I can't see how it has anything to do with the matter?\"\n\nHe was silent for a minute or two as we walked along, but finally he\nsaid:\n\n\"I do not mind telling you--though, as you know, it is not my habit to\nexplain until the end is reached. The present contention is that Mrs.\nInglethorp died of strychnine poisoning, presumably administered in her\ncoffee.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Well, what time was the coffee served?\"\n\n\"About eight o'clock.\"\n\n\"Therefore she drank it between then and half-past eight--certainly not\nmuch later. Well, strychnine is a fairly rapid poison. Its effects\nwould be felt very soon, probably in about an hour.", "Yet, in Mrs.\nInglethorp's case, the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five\no'clock the next morning: nine hours! But a heavy meal, taken at about\nthe same time as the poison, might retard its effects, though hardly to\nthat extent. Still, it is a possibility to be taken into account. But,\naccording to you, she ate very little for supper, and yet the symptoms\ndo not develop until early the next morning! Now that is a curious\ncircumstance, my friend. Something may arise at the autopsy to explain\nit. In the meantime, remember it.\"\n\nAs we neared the house, John came out and met us. His face looked weary\nand haggard.\n\n\"This is a very dreadful business, Monsieur Poirot,\" he said. \"Hastings\nhas explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity?\"\n\n\"I comprehend perfectly.\"\n\n\"You see, it is only suspicion so far. We have nothing to go upon.\"\n\n\"Precisely. It is a matter of precaution only.\"\n\nJohn turned to me, taking out his cigarette-case, and lighting a\ncigarette as he did so.\n\n\"You know that fellow Inglethorp is back?\"\n\n\"Yes. I met him.\"\n\nJohn flung the match into an adjacent flower bed, a proceeding which\nwas too much for Poirot's feelings. He retrieved it, and buried it\nneatly.\n\n\"It's jolly difficult to know how to treat him.\"\n\n\"That difficulty will not exist long,\" pronounced Poirot quietly.\n\nJohn looked puzzled, not quite understanding the portent of this\ncryptic saying. He handed the two keys which Dr. Bauerstein had given\nhim to me.\n\n\"Show Monsieur Poirot everything he wants to see.\"\n\n\"The rooms are locked?\" asked Poirot.\n\n\"Dr. Bauerstein considered it advisable.\"\n\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.\n\n\"Then he is very sure. Well, that simplifies matters for us.\"\n\nWe went up together to the room of the tragedy. For convenience I\nappend a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in\nit.\n\n\n\n\n       02\n\n\n\nPoirot locked the door on the inside, and proceeded to a minute\ninspection of the room. He darted from one object to the other with the\nagility of a grasshopper. I remained by the door, fearing to obliterate\nany clues.", "Poirot, however, did not seem grateful to me for my\nforbearance.\n\n\"What have you, my friend,\" he cried, \"that you remain there like--how\ndo you say it?--ah, yes, the stuck pig?\"\n\nI explained that I was afraid of obliterating any foot-marks.\n\n\"Foot-marks? But what an idea! There has already been practically an\narmy in the room! What foot-marks are we likely to find? No, come here\nand aid me in my search. I will put down my little case until I need\nit.\"\n\nHe did so, on the round table by the window, but it was an ill-advised\nproceeding; for, the top of it being loose, it tilted up, and\nprecipitated the despatch-case on the floor.\n\n\"_Eh voila une table!_\" cried Poirot. \"Ah, my friend, one may live in a\nbig house and yet have no comfort.\"\n\nAfter which piece of moralizing, he resumed his search.\n\nA small purple despatch-case, with a key in the lock, on the\nwriting-table, engaged his attention for some time. He took out the key\nfrom the lock, and passed it to me to inspect. I saw nothing peculiar,\nhowever. It was an ordinary key of the Yale type, with a bit of twisted\nwire through the handle.\n\nNext, he examined the framework of the door we had broken in, assuring\nhimself that the bolt had really been shot. Then he went to the door\nopposite leading into Cynthia's room. That door was also bolted, as I\nhad stated. However, he went to the length of unbolting it, and opening\nand shutting it several times; this he did with the utmost precaution\nagainst making any noise. Suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed\nto rivet his attention. He examined it carefully, and then, nimbly\nwhipping out a pair of small forceps from his case, he drew out some\nminute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope.\n\nOn the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small\nsaucepan on it. A small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the\nsaucepan, and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood\nnear it.", "I wondered how I could have been so unobservant as to overlook this.\nHere was a clue worth having. Poirot delicately dipped his finger into\nliquid, and tasted it gingerly. He made a grimace.\n\n\"Cocoa--with--I think--rum in it.\"\n\nHe passed on to the debris on the floor, where the table by the bed had\nbeen overturned. A reading-lamp, some books, matches, a bunch of keys,\nand the crushed fragments of a coffee-cup lay scattered about.\n\n\"Ah, this is curious,\" said Poirot.\n\n\"I must confess that I see nothing particularly curious about it.\"\n\n\"You do not? Observe the lamp--the chimney is broken in two places; they\nlie there as they fell. But see, the coffee-cup is absolutely smashed\nto powder.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said wearily, \"I suppose someone must have stepped on it.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Poirot, in an odd voice. \"Someone stepped on it.\"\n\nHe rose from his knees, and walked slowly across to the mantelpiece,\nwhere he stood abstractedly fingering the ornaments, and straightening\nthem--a trick of his when he was agitated.\n\n\"_Mon ami_,\" he said, turning to me, \"somebody stepped on that cup,\ngrinding it to powder, and the reason they did so was either because it\ncontained strychnine or--which is far more serious--because it did not\ncontain strychnine!\"\n\nI made no reply. I was bewildered, but I knew that it was no good\nasking him to explain. In a moment or two he roused himself, and went\non with his investigations. He picked up the bunch of keys from the\nfloor, and twirling them round in his fingers finally selected one,\nvery bright and shining, which he tried in the lock of the purple\ndespatch-case. It fitted, and he opened the box, but after a moment's\nhesitation, closed and relocked it, and slipped the bunch of keys, as\nwell as the key that had originally stood in the lock, into his own\npocket.\n\n\"I have no authority to go through these papers. But it should be\ndone--at once!\"\n\nHe then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the\nwash-stand.", "Crossing the room to the left-hand window, a round stain,\nhardly visible on the dark brown carpet, seemed to interest him\nparticularly. He went down on his knees, examining it minutely--even\ngoing so far as to smell it.\n\nFinally, he poured a few drops of the cocoa into a test tube, sealing\nit up carefully. His next proceeding was to take out a little notebook.\n\n\"We have found in this room,\" he said, writing busily, \"six points of\ninterest. Shall I enumerate them, or will you?\"\n\n\"Oh, you,\" I replied hastily.\n\n\"Very well, then. One, a coffee-cup that has been ground into powder;\ntwo, a despatch-case with a key in the lock; three, a stain on the\nfloor.\"\n\n\"That may have been done some time ago,\" I interrupted.\n\n\"No, for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee. Four, a\nfragment of some dark green fabric--only a thread or two, but\nrecognizable.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" I cried. \"That was what you sealed up in the envelope.\"\n\n\"Yes. It may turn out to be a piece of one of Mrs. Inglethorp's own\ndresses, and quite unimportant. We shall see. Five, _this_!\" With a\ndramatic gesture, he pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the\nfloor by the writing-table. \"It must have been done since yesterday,\notherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with\nblotting-paper and a hot iron. One of my best hats once--but that is not\nto the point.\"\n\n\"It was very likely done last night. We were very agitated. Or perhaps\nMrs. Inglethorp herself dropped her candle.\"\n\n\"You brought only one candle into the room?\"\n\n\"Yes. Lawrence Cavendish was carrying it. But he was very upset. He\nseemed to see something over here\"--I indicated the mantelpiece--\"that\nabsolutely paralysed him.\"\n\n\"That is interesting,\" said Poirot quickly. \"Yes, it is suggestive\"--his\neye sweeping the whole length of the wall--\"but it was not his candle\nthat made this great patch, for you perceive that this is white grease;\nwhereas Monsieur Lawrence's candle, which is still on the\ndressing-table, is pink.", "On the other hand, Mrs. Inglethorp had no\ncandlestick in the room, only a reading-lamp.\"\n\n\"Then,\" I said, \"what do you deduce?\"\n\nTo which my friend only made a rather irritating reply, urging me to\nuse my own natural faculties.\n\n\"And the sixth point?\" I asked. \"I suppose it is the sample of cocoa.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Poirot thoughtfully. \"I might have included that in the six,\nbut I did not. No, the sixth point I will keep to myself for the\npresent.\"\n\nHe looked quickly round the room. \"There is nothing more to be done\nhere, I think, unless\"--he stared earnestly and long at the dead ashes\nin the grate. \"The fire burns--and it destroys. But by chance--there\nmight be--let us see!\"\n\nDeftly, on hands and knees, he began to sort the ashes from the grate\ninto the fender, handling them with the greatest caution. Suddenly, he\ngave a faint exclamation.\n\n\"The forceps, Hastings!\"\n\nI quickly handed them to him, and with skill he extracted a small piece\nof half charred paper.\n\n\"There, _mon ami!_\" he cried. \"What do you think of that?\"\n\nI scrutinized the fragment. This is an exact reproduction of it:--\n\n\n\n\n       03\n\n\nI was puzzled. It was unusually thick, quite unlike ordinary notepaper.\nSuddenly an idea struck me.\n\n\"Poirot!\" I cried. \"This is a fragment of a will!\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nI looked up at him sharply.\n\n\"You are not surprised?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said gravely, \"I expected it.\"\n\nI relinquished the piece of paper, and watched him put it away in his\ncase, with the same methodical care that he bestowed on everything. My\nbrain was in a whirl. What was this complication of a will? Who had\ndestroyed it? The person who had left the candle grease on the floor?\nObviously. But how had anyone gained admission? All the doors had been\nbolted on the inside.\n\n\"Now, my friend,\" said Poirot briskly, \"we will go. I should like to\nask a few questions of the parlourmaid--Dorcas, her name is, is it not?\"\n\nWe passed through Alfred Inglethorp's room, and Poirot delayed long\nenough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it.", "We\nwent out through that door, locking both it and that of Mrs.\nInglethorp's room as before.\n\nI took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to see,\nand went myself in search of Dorcas.\n\nWhen I returned with her, however, the boudoir was empty.\n\n\"Poirot,\" I cried, \"where are you?\"\n\n\"I am here, my friend.\"\n\nHe had stepped outside the French window, and was standing, apparently\nlost in admiration, before the various shaped flower beds.\n\n\"Admirable!\" he murmured. \"Admirable! What symmetry! Observe that\ncrescent; and those diamonds--their neatness rejoices the eye. The\nspacing of the plants, also, is perfect. It has been recently done; is\nit not so?\"\n\n\"Yes, I believe they were at it yesterday afternoon. But come in--Dorcas\nis here.\"\n\n\"_Eh bien, eh bien!_ Do not grudge me a moment's satisfaction of the\neye.\"\n\n\"Yes, but this affair is more important.\"\n\n\"And how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal\nimportance?\"\n\nI shrugged my shoulders. There was really no arguing with him if he\nchose to take that line.\n\n\"You do not agree? But such things have been. Well, we will come in and\ninterview the brave Dorcas.\"\n\nDorcas was standing in the boudoir, her hands folded in front of her,\nand her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap. She was the\nvery model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant.\n\nIn her attitude towards Poirot, she was inclined to be suspicious, but\nhe soon broke down her defences. He drew forward a chair.\n\n\"Pray be seated, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"You have been with your mistress many years, is it not so?\"\n\n\"Ten years, sir.\"\n\n\"That is a long time, and very faithful service. You were much attached\nto her, were you not?\"\n\n\"She was a very good mistress to me, sir.\"\n\n\"Then you will not object to answering a few questions. I put them to\nyou with Mr. Cavendish's full approval.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly, sir.\"\n\n\"Then I will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday\nafternoon. Your mistress had a quarrel?\"", "\"Yes, sir. But I don't know that I ought----\" Dorcas hesitated.\n\nPoirot looked at her keenly.\n\n\"My good Dorcas, it is necessary that I should know every detail of\nthat quarrel as fully as possible. Do not think that you are betraying\nyour mistress's secrets. Your mistress lies dead, and it is necessary\nthat we should know all--if we are to avenge her. Nothing can bring her\nback to life, but we do hope, if there has been foul play, to bring the\nmurderer to justice.\"\n\n\"Amen to that,\" said Dorcas fiercely. \"And, naming no names, there's\n_one_ in this house that none of us could ever abide! And an ill day it\nwas when first _he_ darkened the threshold.\"\n\nPoirot waited for her indignation to subside, and then, resuming his\nbusiness-like tone, he asked:\n\n\"Now, as to this quarrel? What is the first you heard of it?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday----\"\n\n\"What time was that?\"\n\n\"I couldn't say exactly, sir, but it wasn't tea-time by a long way.\nPerhaps four o'clock--or it may have been a bit later. Well, sir, as I\nsaid, I happened to be passing along, when I heard voices very loud and\nangry in here. I didn't exactly mean to listen, but--well, there it is.\nI stopped. The door was shut, but the mistress was speaking very sharp\nand clear, and I heard what she said quite plainly. 'You have lied to\nme, and deceived me,' she said. I didn't hear what Mr. Inglethorp\nreplied. He spoke a good bit lower than she did--but she answered: 'How\ndare you? I have kept you and clothed you and fed you! You owe\neverything to me! And this is how you repay me! By bringing disgrace\nupon our name!' Again I didn't hear what he said, but she went on:\n'Nothing that you can say will make any difference. I see my duty\nclearly. My mind is made up. You need not think that any fear of\npublicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.'", "Then I\nthought I heard them coming out, so I went off quickly.\"\n\n\"You are sure it was Mr. Inglethorp's voice you heard?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir, whose else's could it be?\"\n\n\"Well, what happened next?\"\n\n\"Later, I came back to the hall; but it was all quiet. At five o'clock,\nMrs. Inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of\ntea--nothing to eat--to the boudoir. She was looking dreadful--so white\nand upset. 'Dorcas,' she says, 'I've had a great shock.' 'I'm sorry for\nthat, m'm,' I says. 'You'll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea,\nm'm.' She had something in her hand. I don't know if it was a letter,\nor just a piece of paper, but it had writing on it, and she kept\nstaring at it, almost as if she couldn't believe what was written\nthere. She whispered to herself, as though she had forgotten I was\nthere: 'These few words--and everything's changed.' And then she says to\nme: 'Never trust a man, Dorcas, they're not worth it!' I hurried off,\nand got her a good strong cup of tea, and she thanked me, and said\nshe'd feel better when she'd drunk it. 'I don't know what to do,' she\nsays. 'Scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing, Dorcas.\nI'd rather hush it up if I could.' Mrs. Cavendish came in just then, so\nshe didn't say any more.\"\n\n\"She still had the letter, or whatever it was, in her hand?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"What would she be likely to do with it afterwards?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know, sir, I expect she would lock it up in that purple\ncase of hers.\"\n\n\"Is that where she usually kept important papers?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. She brought it down with her every morning, and took it up\nevery night.\"\n\n\"When did she lose the key of it?\"\n\n\"She missed it yesterday at lunch-time, sir, and told me to look\ncarefully for it. She was very much put out about it.\"\n\n\"But she had a duplicate key?\"", "\"Oh, yes, sir.\"\n\nDorcas was looking very curiously at him and, to tell the truth, so was\nI. What was all this about a lost key? Poirot smiled.\n\n\"Never mind, Dorcas, it is my business to know things. Is this the key\nthat was lost?\" He drew from his pocket the key that he had found in\nthe lock of the despatch-case upstairs.\n\nDorcas's eyes looked as though they would pop out of her head.\n\n\"That's it, sir, right enough. But where did you find it? I looked\neverywhere for it.\"\n\n\"Ah, but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was\nto-day. Now, to pass to another subject, had your mistress a dark green\ndress in her wardrobe?\"\n\nDorcas was rather startled by the unexpected question.\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Are you quite sure?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Has anyone else in the house got a green dress?\"\n\nDorcas reflected.\n\n\"Miss Cynthia has a green evening dress.\"\n\n\"Light or dark green?\"\n\n\"A light green, sir; a sort of chiffon, they call it.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is not what I want. And nobody else has anything green?\"\n\n\"No, sir--not that I know of.\"\n\nPoirot's face did not betray a trace of whether he was disappointed or\notherwise. He merely remarked:\n\n\"Good, we will leave that and pass on. Have you any reason to believe\nthat your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night?\"\n\n\"Not _last_ night, sir, I know she didn't.\"\n\n\"Why do you know so positively?\"\n\n\"Because the box was empty. She took the last one two days ago, and she\ndidn't have any more made up.\"\n\n\"You are quite sure of that?\"\n\n\"Positive, sir.\"\n\n\"Then that is cleared up! By the way, your mistress didn't ask you to\nsign any paper yesterday?\"\n\n\"To sign a paper? No, sir.\"\n\n\"When Mr. Hastings and Mr. Lawrence came in yesterday evening, they\nfound your mistress busy writing letters. I suppose you can give me no\nidea to whom these letters were addressed?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I couldn't, sir. I was out in the evening. Perhaps Annie\ncould tell you, though she's a careless girl.", "Never cleared the\ncoffee-cups away last night. That's what happens when I'm not here to\nlook after things.\"\n\nPoirot lifted his hand.\n\n\"Since they have been left, Dorcas, leave them a little longer, I pray\nyou. I should like to examine them.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir.\"\n\n\"What time did you go out last evening?\"\n\n\"About six o'clock, sir.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Dorcas, that is all I have to ask you.\" He rose and\nstrolled to the window. \"I have been admiring these flower beds. How\nmany gardeners are employed here, by the way?\"\n\n\"Only three now, sir. Five, we had, before the war, when it was kept as\na gentleman's place should be. I wish you could have seen it then, sir.\nA fair sight it was. But now there's only old Manning, and young\nWilliam, and a new-fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such-like.\nAh, these are dreadful times!\"\n\n\"The good times will come again, Dorcas. At least, we hope so. Now,\nwill you send Annie to me here?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"How did you know that Mrs. Inglethorp took sleeping powders?\" I asked,\nin lively curiosity, as Dorcas left the room. \"And about the lost key\nand the duplicate?\"\n\n\"One thing at a time. As to the sleeping powders, I knew by this.\" He\nsuddenly produced a small cardboard box, such as chemists use for\npowders.\n\n\"Where did you find it?\"\n\n\"In the wash-stand drawer in Mrs. Inglethorp's bedroom. It was Number\nSix of my catalogue.\"\n\n\"But I suppose, as the last powder was taken two days ago, it is not of\nmuch importance?\"\n\n\"Probably not, but do you notice anything that strikes you as peculiar\nabout this box?\"\n\nI examined it closely.\n\n\"No, I can't say that I do.\"\n\n\"Look at the label.\"\n\nI read the label carefully: \"'One powder to be taken at bedtime, if\nrequired. Mrs. Inglethorp.' No, I see nothing unusual.\"\n\n\"Not the fact that there is no chemist's name?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" I exclaimed. \"To be sure, that is odd!\"\n\n\"Have you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that, without his\nprinted name?\"", "\"No, I can't say that I have.\"\n\nI was becoming quite excited, but Poirot damped my ardour by remarking:\n\n\"Yet the explanation is quite simple. So do not intrigue yourself, my\nfriend.\"\n\nAn audible creaking proclaimed the approach of Annie, so I had no time\nto reply.\n\nAnnie was a fine, strapping girl, and was evidently labouring under\nintense excitement, mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the\ntragedy.\n\nPoirot came to the point at once, with a business-like briskness.\n\n\"I sent for you, Annie, because I thought you might be able to tell me\nsomething about the letters Mrs. Inglethorp wrote last night. How many\nwere there? And can you tell me any of the names and addresses?\"\n\nAnnie considered.\n\n\"There were four letters, sir. One was to Miss Howard, and one was to\nMr. Wells, the lawyer, and the other two I don't think I remember,\nsir--oh, yes, one was to Ross's, the caterers in Tadminster. The other\none, I don't remember.\"\n\n\"Think,\" urged Poirot.\n\nAnnie racked her brains in vain.\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir, but it's clean gone. I don't think I can have noticed\nit.\"\n\n\"It does not matter,\" said Poirot, not betraying any sign of\ndisappointment. \"Now I want to ask you about something else. There is a\nsaucepan in Mrs. Inglethorp's room with some cocoa in it. Did she have\nthat every night?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, it was put in her room every evening, and she warmed it up\nin the night--whenever she fancied it.\"\n\n\"What was it? Plain cocoa?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, made with milk, with a teaspoonful of sugar, and two\nteaspoonfuls of rum in it.\"\n\n\"Who took it to her room?\"\n\n\"I did, sir.\"\n\n\"Always?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"At what time?\"\n\n\"When I went to draw the curtains, as a rule, sir.\"\n\n\"Did you bring it straight up from the kitchen then?\"\n\n\"No, sir, you see there's not much room on the gas stove, so cook used\nto make it early, before putting the vegetables on for supper. Then I\nused to bring it up, and put it on the table by the swing door, and\ntake it into her room later.\"", "\"The swing door is in the left wing, is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And the table, is it on this side of the door, or on the\nfarther--servants' side?\"\n\n\"It's this side, sir.\"\n\n\"What time did you bring it up last night?\"\n\n\"About quarter-past seven, I should say, sir.\"\n\n\"And when did you take it into Mrs. Inglethorp's room?\"\n\n\"When I went to shut up, sir. About eight o'clock. Mrs. Inglethorp came\nup to bed before I'd finished.\"\n\n\"Then, between seven-fifteen and eight o'clock, the cocoa was standing\non the table in the left wing?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Annie had been growing redder and redder in the face, and\nnow she blurted out unexpectedly:\n\n\"And if there _was_ salt in it, sir, it wasn't me. I never took the\nsalt near it.\"\n\n\"What makes you think there was salt in it?\" asked Poirot.\n\n\"Seeing it on the tray, sir.\"\n\n\"You saw some salt on the tray?\"\n\n\"Yes. Coarse kitchen salt, it looked. I never noticed it when I took\nthe tray up, but when I came to take it into the mistress's room I saw\nit at once, and I suppose I ought to have taken it down again, and\nasked cook to make some fresh. But I was in a hurry, because Dorcas was\nout, and I thought maybe the cocoa itself was all right, and the salt\nhad only gone on the tray. So I dusted it off with my apron, and took\nit in.\"\n\nI had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement. Unknown to\nherself, Annie had provided us with an important piece of evidence. How\nshe would have gaped if she had realized that her \"coarse kitchen salt\"\nwas strychnine, one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind. I\nmarvelled at Poirot's calm. His self-control was astonishing. I awaited\nhis next question with impatience, but it disappointed me.\n\n\"When you went into Mrs. Inglethorp's room, was the door leading into\nMiss Cynthia's room bolted?\"\n\n\"Oh! Yes, sir; it always was. It had never been opened.\"\n\n\"And the door into Mr. Inglethorp's room?", "Did you notice if that was\nbolted too?\"\n\nAnnie hesitated.\n\n\"I couldn't rightly say, sir; it was shut but I couldn't say whether it\nwas bolted or not.\"\n\n\"When you finally left the room, did Mrs. Inglethorp bolt the door\nafter you?\"\n\n\"No, sir, not then, but I expect she did later. She usually did lock it\nat night. The door into the passage, that is.\"\n\n\"Did you notice any candle grease on the floor when you did the room\nyesterday?\"\n\n\"Candle grease? Oh, no, sir. Mrs. Inglethorp didn't have a candle, only\na reading-lamp.\"\n\n\"Then, if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor,\nyou think you would have been sure to have seen it?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, and I would have taken it out with a piece of blotting-paper\nand a hot iron.\"\n\nThen Poirot repeated the question he had put to Dorcas:\n\n\"Did your mistress ever have a green dress?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Nor a mantle, nor a cape, nor a--how do you call it?--a sports coat?\"\n\n\"Not green, sir.\"\n\n\"Nor anyone else in the house?\"\n\nAnnie reflected.\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"You are sure of that?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.\"\n\n\"_Bien!_ That is all I want to know. Thank you very much.\"\n\nWith a nervous giggle, Annie took herself creakingly out of the room.\nMy pent-up excitement burst forth.\n\n\"Poirot,\" I cried, \"I congratulate you! This is a great discovery.\"\n\n\"What is a great discovery?\"\n\n\"Why, that it was the cocoa and not the coffee that was poisoned. That\nexplains everything! Of course it did not take effect until the early\nmorning, since the cocoa was only drunk in the middle of the night.\"\n\n\"So you think that the cocoa--mark well what I say, Hastings, the\n_cocoa_--contained strychnine?\"\n\n\"Of course! That salt on the tray, what else could it have been?\"\n\n\"It might have been salt,\" replied Poirot placidly.\n\nI shrugged my shoulders. If he was going to take the matter that way,\nit was no good arguing with him. The idea crossed my mind, not for the\nfirst time, that poor old Poirot was growing old.", "Privately I thought\nit lucky that he had associated with him someone of a more receptive\ntype of mind.\n\nPoirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes.\n\n\"You are not pleased with me, _mon ami?_\"\n\n\"My dear Poirot,\" I said coldly, \"it is not for me to dictate to you.\nYou have a right to your own opinion, just as I have to mine.\"\n\n\"A most admirable sentiment,\" remarked Poirot, rising briskly to his\nfeet. \"Now I have finished with this room. By the way, whose is the\nsmaller desk in the corner?\"\n\n\"Mr. Inglethorp's.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" He tried the roll top tentatively. \"Locked. But perhaps one of\nMrs. Inglethorp's keys would open it.\" He tried several, twisting and\nturning them with a practiced hand, and finally uttering an ejaculation\nof satisfaction. \"_Voila!_ It is not the key, but it will open it at a\npinch.\" He slid back the roll top, and ran a rapid eye over the neatly\nfiled papers. To my surprise, he did not examine them, merely remarking\napprovingly as he relocked the desk: \"Decidedly, he is a man of method,\nthis Mr. Inglethorp!\"\n\nA \"man of method\" was, in Poirot's estimation, the highest praise that\ncould be bestowed on any individual.\n\nI felt that my friend was not what he had been as he rambled on\ndisconnectedly:\n\n\"There were no stamps in his desk, but there might have been, eh, _mon\nami?_ There might have been? Yes\"--his eyes wandered round the\nroom--\"this boudoir has nothing more to tell us. It did not yield much.\nOnly this.\"\n\nHe pulled a crumpled envelope out of his pocket, and tossed it over to\nme. It was rather a curious document. A plain, dirty looking old\nenvelope with a few words scrawled across it, apparently at random. The\nfollowing is a facsimile of it.\n\n\n\n\n       04\n\n\"Where did you find this?\" I asked Poirot, in lively curiosity.\n\n\"In the waste-paper basket. You recognise the handwriting?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is Mrs. Inglethorp's. But what does it mean?\"\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I cannot say--but it is suggestive.\"\n\nA wild idea flashed across me.", "Was it possible that Mrs. Inglethorp's\nmind was deranged? Had she some fantastic idea of demoniacal\npossession? And, if that were so, was it not also possible that she\nmight have taken her own life?\n\nI was about to expound these theories to Poirot, when his own words\ndistracted me.\n\n\"Come,\" he said, \"now to examine the coffee-cups!\"\n\n\"My dear Poirot! What on earth is the good of that, now that we know\nabout the cocoa?\"\n\n\"Oh, _la la!_ That miserable cocoa!\" cried Poirot flippantly.\n\nHe laughed with apparent enjoyment, raising his arms to heaven in mock\ndespair, in what I could not but consider the worst possible taste.\n\n\"And, anyway,\" I said, with increasing coldness, \"as Mrs. Inglethorp\ntook her coffee upstairs with her, I do not see what you expect to\nfind, unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of\nstrychnine on the coffee tray!\"\n\nPoirot was sobered at once.\n\n\"Come, come, my friend,\" he said, slipping his arms through mine. \"_Ne\nvous fachez pas!_ Allow me to interest myself in my coffee-cups, and I\nwill respect your cocoa. There! Is it a bargain?\"\n\nHe was so quaintly humorous that I was forced to laugh; and we went\ntogether to the drawing-room, where the coffee-cups and tray remained\nundisturbed as we had left them.\n\nPoirot made me recapitulate the scene of the night before, listening\nvery carefully, and verifying the position of the various cups.\n\n\"So Mrs. Cavendish stood by the tray--and poured out. Yes. Then she came\nacross to the window where you sat with Mademoiselle Cynthia. Yes. Here\nare the three cups. And the cup on the mantelpiece, half drunk, that\nwould be Mr. Lawrence Cavendish's. And the one on the tray?\"\n\n\"John Cavendish's. I saw him put it down there.\"\n\n\"Good. One, two, three, four, five--but where, then, is the cup of Mr.\nInglethorp?\"\n\n\"He does not take coffee.\"\n\n\"Then all are accounted for. One moment, my friend.\"\n\nWith infinite care, he took a drop or two from the grounds in each cup,\nsealing them up in separate test tubes, tasting each in turn as he did\nso.", "His physiognomy underwent a curious change. An expression gathered\nthere that I can only describe as half puzzled, and half relieved.\n\n\"_Bien!_\" he said at last. \"It is evident! I had an idea--but clearly I\nwas mistaken. Yes, altogether I was mistaken. Yet it is strange. But no\nmatter!\"\n\nAnd, with a characteristic shrug, he dismissed whatever it was that was\nworrying him from his mind. I could have told him from the beginning\nthat this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind\nalley, but I restrained my tongue. After all, though he was old, Poirot\nhad been a great man in his day.\n\n\"Breakfast is ready,\" said John Cavendish, coming in from the hall.\n\"You will breakfast with us, Monsieur Poirot?\"\n\nPoirot acquiesced. I observed John. Already he was almost restored to\nhis normal self. The shock of the events of the last night had upset\nhim temporarily, but his equable poise soon swung back to the normal.\nHe was a man of very little imagination, in sharp contrast with his\nbrother, who had, perhaps, too much.\n\nEver since the early hours of the morning, John had been hard at work,\nsending telegrams--one of the first had gone to Evelyn Howard--writing\nnotices for the papers, and generally occupying himself with the\nmelancholy duties that a death entails.\n\n\"May I ask how things are proceeding?\" he said. \"Do your investigations\npoint to my mother having died a natural death--or--or must we prepare\nourselves for the worst?\"\n\n\"I think, Mr. Cavendish,\" said Poirot gravely, \"that you would do well\nnot to buoy yourself up with any false hopes. Can you tell me the views\nof the other members of the family?\"\n\n\"My brother Lawrence is convinced that we are making a fuss over\nnothing. He says that everything points to its being a simple case of\nheart failure.\"\n\n\"He does, does he? That is very interesting--very interesting,\" murmured\nPoirot softly. \"And Mrs. Cavendish?\"\n\nA faint cloud passed over John's face.\n\n\"I have not the least idea what my wife's views on the subject are.\"", "The answer brought a momentary stiffness in its train. John broke the\nrather awkward silence by saying with a slight effort:\n\n\"I told you, didn't I, that Mr. Inglethorp has returned?\"\n\nPoirot bent his head.\n\n\"It's an awkward position for all of us. Of course one has to treat him\nas usual--but, hang it all, one's gorge does rise at sitting down to eat\nwith a possible murderer!\"\n\nPoirot nodded sympathetically.\n\n\"I quite understand. It is a very difficult situation for you, Mr.\nCavendish. I would like to ask you one question. Mr. Inglethorp's\nreason for not returning last night was, I believe, that he had\nforgotten the latch-key. Is not that so?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I suppose you are quite sure that the latch-key _was_ forgotten--that\nhe did not take it after all?\"\n\n\"I have no idea. I never thought of looking. We always keep it in the\nhall drawer. I'll go and see if it's there now.\"\n\nPoirot held up his hand with a faint smile.\n\n\"No, no, Mr. Cavendish, it is too late now. I am certain that you would\nfind it. If Mr. Inglethorp did take it, he has had ample time to\nreplace it by now.\"\n\n\"But do you think----\"\n\n\"I think nothing. If anyone had chanced to look this morning before his\nreturn, and seen it there, it would have been a valuable point in his\nfavour. That is all.\"\n\nJohn looked perplexed.\n\n\"Do not worry,\" said Poirot smoothly. \"I assure you that you need not\nlet it trouble you. Since you are so kind, let us go and have some\nbreakfast.\"\n\nEveryone was assembled in the dining-room. Under the circumstances, we\nwere naturally not a cheerful party. The reaction after a shock is\nalways trying, and I think we were all suffering from it. Decorum and\ngood breeding naturally enjoined that our demeanour should be much as\nusual, yet I could not help wondering if this self-control were really\na matter of great difficulty. There were no red eyes, no signs of\nsecretly indulged grief. I felt that I was right in my opinion that\nDorcas was the person most affected by the personal side of the\ntragedy.", "I pass over Alfred Inglethorp, who acted the bereaved widower in a\nmanner that I felt to be disgusting in its hypocrisy. Did he know that\nwe suspected him, I wondered. Surely he could not be unaware of the\nfact, conceal it as we would. Did he feel some secret stirring of fear,\nor was he confident that his crime would go unpunished? Surely the\nsuspicion in the atmosphere must warn him that he was already a marked\nman.\n\nBut did everyone suspect him? What about Mrs. Cavendish? I watched her\nas she sat at the head of the table, graceful, composed, enigmatic. In\nher soft grey frock, with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her\nslender hands, she looked very beautiful. When she chose, however, her\nface could be sphinx-like in its inscrutability. She was very silent,\nhardly opening her lips, and yet in some queer way I felt that the\ngreat strength of her personality was dominating us all.\n\nAnd little Cynthia? Did she suspect? She looked very tired and ill, I\nthought. The heaviness and languor of her manner were very marked. I\nasked her if she were feeling ill, and she answered frankly:\n\n\"Yes, I've got the most beastly headache.\"\n\n\"Have another cup of coffee, mademoiselle?\" said Poirot solicitously.\n\"It will revive you. It is unparalleled for the _mal de tete_.\" He\njumped up and took her cup.\n\n\"No sugar,\" said Cynthia, watching him, as he picked up the\nsugar-tongs.\n\n\"No sugar? You abandon it in the war-time, eh?\"\n\n\"No, I never take it in coffee.\"\n\n\"_Sacre!_\" murmured Poirot to himself, as he brought back the\nreplenished cup.\n\nOnly I heard him, and glancing up curiously at the little man I saw\nthat his face was working with suppressed excitement, and his eyes were\nas green as a cat's. He had heard or seen something that had affected\nhim strongly--but what was it? I do not usually label myself as dense,\nbut I must confess that nothing out of the ordinary had attracted _my_\nattention.\n\nIn another moment, the door opened and Dorcas appeared.", "\"Mr. Wells to see you, sir,\" she said to John.\n\nI remembered the name as being that of the lawyer to whom Mrs.\nInglethorp had written the night before.\n\nJohn rose immediately.\n\n\"Show him into my study.\" Then he turned to us. \"My mother's lawyer,\"\nhe explained. And in a lower voice: \"He is also Coroner--you understand.\nPerhaps you would like to come with me?\"\n\nWe acquiesced and followed him out of the room. John strode on ahead\nand I took the opportunity of whispering to Poirot:\n\n\"There will be an inquest then?\"\n\nPoirot nodded absently. He seemed absorbed in thought; so much so that\nmy curiosity was aroused.\n\n\"What is it? You are not attending to what I say.\"\n\n\"It is true, my friend. I am much worried.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because Mademoiselle Cynthia does not take sugar in her coffee.\"\n\n\"What? You cannot be serious?\"\n\n\"But I am most serious. Ah, there is something there that I do not\nunderstand. My instinct was right.\"\n\n\"What instinct?\"\n\n\"The instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffee-cups.\n_Chut!_ no more now!\"\n\nWe followed John into his study, and he closed the door behind us.\n\nMr. Wells was a pleasant man of middle-age, with keen eyes, and the\ntypical lawyer's mouth. John introduced us both, and explained the\nreason of our presence.\n\n\"You will understand, Wells,\" he added, \"that this is all strictly\nprivate. We are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for\ninvestigation of any kind.\"\n\n\"Quite so, quite so,\" said Mr. Wells soothingly. \"I wish we could have\nspared you the pain and publicity of an inquest, but of course it's\nquite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor's certificate.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose so.\"\n\n\"Clever man, Bauerstein. Great authority on toxicology, I believe.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said John with a certain stiffness in his manner. Then he\nadded rather hesitatingly: \"Shall we have to appear as witnesses--all of\nus, I mean?\"\n\n\"You, of course--and ah--er--Mr.--er--Inglethorp.\"\n\nA slight pause ensued before the lawyer went on in his soothing manner:\n\n\"Any other evidence will be simply confirmatory, a mere matter of\nform.\"", "\"I see.\"\n\nA faint expression of relief swept over John's face. It puzzled me, for\nI saw no occasion for it.\n\n\"If you know of nothing to the contrary,\" pursued Mr. Wells, \"I had\nthought of Friday. That will give us plenty of time for the doctor's\nreport. The post-mortem is to take place to-night, I believe?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then that arrangement will suit you?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"I need not tell you, my dear Cavendish, how distressed I am at this\nmost tragic affair.\"\n\n\"Can you give us no help in solving it, monsieur?\" interposed Poirot,\nspeaking for the first time since we had entered the room.\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes, we heard that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote to you last night. You should\nhave received the letter this morning.\"\n\n\"I did, but it contains no information. It is merely a note asking me\nto call upon her this morning, as she wanted my advice on a matter of\ngreat importance.\"\n\n\"She gave you no hint as to what that matter might be?\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, no.\"\n\n\"That is a pity,\" said John.\n\n\"A great pity,\" agreed Poirot gravely.\n\nThere was silence. Poirot remained lost in thought for a few minutes.\nFinally he turned to the lawyer again.\n\n\"Mr. Wells, there is one thing I should like to ask you--that is, if it\nis not against professional etiquette. In the event of Mrs.\nInglethorp's death, who would inherit her money?\"\n\nThe lawyer hesitated a moment, and then replied:\n\n\"The knowledge will be public property very soon, so if Mr. Cavendish\ndoes not object----\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" interpolated John.\n\n\"I do not see any reason why I should not answer your question. By her\nlast will, dated August of last year, after various unimportant\nlegacies to servants, etc., she gave her entire fortune to her stepson,\nMr. John Cavendish.\"\n\n\"Was not that--pardon the question, Mr. Cavendish--rather unfair to her\nother stepson, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish?\"\n\n\"No, I do not think so. You see, under the terms of their father's\nwill, while John inherited the property, Lawrence, at his stepmother's\ndeath, would come into a considerable sum of money.", "Mrs. Inglethorp\nleft her money to her elder stepson, knowing that he would have to keep\nup Styles. It was, to my mind, a very fair and equitable distribution.\"\n\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.\n\n\"I see. But I am right in saying, am I not, that by your English law\nthat will was automatically revoked when Mrs. Inglethorp remarried?\"\n\nMr. Wells bowed his head.\n\n\"As I was about to proceed, Monsieur Poirot, that document is now null\nand void.\"\n\n\"_Hein!_\" said Poirot. He reflected for a moment, and then asked: \"Was\nMrs. Inglethorp herself aware of that fact?\"\n\n\"I do not know. She may have been.\"\n\n\"She was,\" said John unexpectedly. \"We were discussing the matter of\nwills being revoked by marriage only yesterday.\"\n\n\"Ah! One more question, Mr. Wells. You say 'her last will.' Had Mrs.\nInglethorp, then, made several former wills?\"\n\n\"On an average, she made a new will at least once a year,\" said Mr.\nWells imperturbably. \"She was given to changing her mind as to her\ntestamentary dispositions, now benefiting one, now another member of\nher family.\"\n\n\"Suppose,\" suggested Poirot, \"that, unknown to you, she had made a new\nwill in favour of someone who was not, in any sense of the word, a\nmember of the family--we will say Miss Howard, for instance--would you be\nsurprised?\"\n\n\"Not in the least.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Poirot seemed to have exhausted his questions.\n\nI drew close to him, while John and the lawyer were debating the\nquestion of going through Mrs. Inglethorp's papers.\n\n\"Do you think Mrs. Inglethorp made a will leaving all her money to Miss\nHoward?\" I asked in a low voice, with some curiosity.\n\nPoirot smiled.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then why did you ask?\"\n\n\"Hush!\"\n\nJohn Cavendish had turned to Poirot.\n\n\"Will you come with us, Monsieur Poirot? We are going through my\nmother's papers. Mr. Inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely\nto Mr. Wells and myself.\"\n\n\"Which simplifies matters very much,\" murmured the lawyer. \"As\ntechnically, of course, he was entitled----\" He did not finish the\nsentence.\n\n\"We will look through the desk in the boudoir first,\" explained John,\n\"and go up to her bedroom afterwards.", "She kept her most important\npapers in a purple despatch-case, which we must look through\ncarefully.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the lawyer, \"it is quite possible that there may be a later\nwill than the one in my possession.\"\n\n\"There _is_ a later will.\" It was Poirot who spoke.\n\n\"What?\" John and the lawyer looked at him startled.\n\n\"Or, rather,\" pursued my friend imperturbably, \"there _was_ one.\"\n\n\"What do you mean--there was one? Where is it now?\"\n\n\"Burnt!\"\n\n\"Burnt?\"\n\n\"Yes. See here.\" He took out the charred fragment we had found in the\ngrate in Mrs. Inglethorp's room, and handed it to the lawyer with a\nbrief explanation of when and where he had found it.\n\n\"But possibly this is an old will?\"\n\n\"I do not think so. In fact I am almost certain that it was made no\nearlier than yesterday afternoon.\"\n\n\"What?\" \"Impossible!\" broke simultaneously from both men.\n\nPoirot turned to John.\n\n\"If you will allow me to send for your gardener, I will prove it to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course--but I don't see----\"\n\nPoirot raised his hand.\n\n\"Do as I ask you. Afterwards you shall question as much as you please.\"\n\n\"Very well.\" He rang the bell.\n\nDorcas answered it in due course.\n\n\"Dorcas, will you tell Manning to come round and speak to me here.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nDorcas withdrew.\n\nWe waited in a tense silence. Poirot alone seemed perfectly at his\nease, and dusted a forgotten corner of the bookcase.\n\nThe clumping of hobnailed boots on the gravel outside proclaimed the\napproach of Manning. John looked questioningly at Poirot. The latter\nnodded.\n\n\"Come inside, Manning,\" said John, \"I want to speak to you.\"\n\nManning came slowly and hesitatingly through the French window, and\nstood as near it as he could. He held his cap in his hands, twisting it\nvery carefully round and round. His back was much bent, though he was\nprobably not as old as he looked, but his eyes were sharp and\nintelligent, and belied his slow and rather cautious speech.\n\n\"Manning,\" said John, \"this gentleman will put some questions to you\nwhich I want you to answer.\"", "\"Yessir,\" mumbled Manning.\n\nPoirot stepped forward briskly. Manning's eye swept over him with a\nfaint contempt.\n\n\"You were planting a bed of begonias round by the south side of the\nhouse yesterday afternoon, were you not, Manning?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, me and Willum.\"\n\n\"And Mrs. Inglethorp came to the window and called you, did she not?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, she did.\"\n\n\"Tell me in your own words exactly what happened after that.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, nothing much. She just told Willum to go on his bicycle\ndown to the village, and bring back a form of will, or such-like--I\ndon't know what exactly--she wrote it down for him.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, he did, sir.\"\n\n\"And what happened next?\"\n\n\"We went on with the begonias, sir.\"\n\n\"Did not Mrs. Inglethorp call you again?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, both me and Willum, she called.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"She made us come right in, and sign our names at the bottom of a long\npaper--under where she'd signed.\"\n\n\"Did you see anything of what was written above her signature?\" asked\nPoirot sharply.\n\n\"No, sir, there was a bit of blotting paper over that part.\"\n\n\"And you signed where she told you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, first me and then Willum.\"\n\n\"What did she do with it afterwards?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, she slipped it into a long envelope, and put it inside a\nsort of purple box that was standing on the desk.\"\n\n\"What time was it when she first called you?\"\n\n\"About four, I should say, sir.\"\n\n\"Not earlier? Couldn't it have been about half-past three?\"\n\n\"No, I shouldn't say so, sir. It would be more likely to be a bit after\nfour--not before it.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Manning, that will do,\" said Poirot pleasantly.\n\nThe gardener glanced at his master, who nodded, whereupon Manning\nlifted a finger to his forehead with a low mumble, and backed\ncautiously out of the window.\n\nWe all looked at each other.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" murmured John. \"What an extraordinary coincidence.\"\n\n\"How--a coincidence?\"\n\n\"That my mother should have made a will on the very day of her death!\"\n\nMr. Wells cleared his throat and remarked drily:\n\n\"Are you so sure it is a coincidence, Cavendish?\"", "\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Your mother, you tell me, had a violent quarrel with--someone yesterday\nafternoon----\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" cried John again. There was a tremor in his voice,\nand he had gone very pale.\n\n\"In consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly and\nhurriedly makes a new will. The contents of that will we shall never\nknow. She told no one of its provisions. This morning, no doubt, she\nwould have consulted me on the subject--but she had no chance. The will\ndisappears, and she takes its secret with her to her grave. Cavendish,\nI much fear there is no coincidence there. Monsieur Poirot, I am sure\nyou agree with me that the facts are very suggestive.\"\n\n\"Suggestive, or not,\" interrupted John, \"we are most grateful to\nMonsieur Poirot for elucidating the matter. But for him, we should\nnever have known of this will. I suppose, I may not ask you, monsieur,\nwhat first led you to suspect the fact?\"\n\nPoirot smiled and answered:\n\n\"A scribbled over old envelope, and a freshly planted bed of begonias.\"\n\nJohn, I think, would have pressed his questions further, but at that\nmoment the loud purr of a motor was audible, and we all turned to the\nwindow as it swept past.\n\n\"Evie!\" cried John. \"Excuse me, Wells.\" He went hurriedly out into the\nhall.\n\nPoirot looked inquiringly at me.\n\n\"Miss Howard,\" I explained.\n\n\"Ah, I am glad she has come. There is a woman with a head and a heart\ntoo, Hastings. Though the good God gave her no beauty!\"\n\nI followed John's example, and went out into the hall, where Miss\nHoward was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass\nof veils that enveloped her head. As her eyes fell on me, a sudden pang\nof guilt shot through me. This was the woman who had warned me so\nearnestly, and to whose warning I had, alas, paid no heed! How soon,\nand how contemptuously, I had dismissed it from my mind. Now that she\nhad been proved justified in so tragic a manner, I felt ashamed.", "She\nhad known Alfred Inglethorp only too well. I wondered whether, if she\nhad remained at Styles, the tragedy would have taken place, or would\nthe man have feared her watchful eyes?\n\nI was relieved when she shook me by the hand, with her well remembered\npainful grip. The eyes that met mine were sad, but not reproachful;\nthat she had been crying bitterly, I could tell by the redness of her\neyelids, but her manner was unchanged from its old gruffness.\n\n\"Started the moment I got the wire. Just come off night duty. Hired\ncar. Quickest way to get here.\"\n\n\"Have you had anything to eat this morning, Evie?\" asked John.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I thought not. Come along, breakfast's not cleared away yet, and\nthey'll make you some fresh tea.\" He turned to me. \"Look after her,\nHastings, will you? Wells is waiting for me. Oh, here's Monsieur\nPoirot. He's helping us, you know, Evie.\"\n\nMiss Howard shook hands with Poirot, but glanced suspiciously over her\nshoulder at John.\n\n\"What do you mean--helping us?\"\n\n\"Helping us to investigate.\"\n\n\"Nothing to investigate. Have they taken him to prison yet?\"\n\n\"Taken who to prison?\"\n\n\"Who? Alfred Inglethorp, of course!\"\n\n\"My dear Evie, do be careful. Lawrence is of the opinion that my mother\ndied from heart seizure.\"\n\n\"More fool, Lawrence!\" retorted Miss Howard. \"Of course Alfred\nInglethorp murdered poor Emily--as I always told you he would.\"\n\n\"My dear Evie, don't shout so. Whatever we may think or suspect, it is\nbetter to say as little as possible for the present. The inquest isn't\nuntil Friday.\"\n\n\"Not until fiddlesticks!\" The snort Miss Howard gave was truly\nmagnificent. \"You're all off your heads. The man will be out of the\ncountry by then. If he's any sense, he won't stay here tamely and wait\nto be hanged.\"\n\nJohn Cavendish looked at her helplessly.\n\n\"I know what it is,\" she accused him, \"you've been listening to the\ndoctors. Never should. What do they know? Nothing at all--or just enough\nto make them dangerous. I ought to know--my own father was a doctor.", "That little Wilkins is about the greatest fool that even I have ever\nseen. Heart seizure! Sort of thing he would say. Anyone with any sense\ncould see at once that her husband had poisoned her. I always said he'd\nmurder her in her bed, poor soul. Now he's done it. And all you can do\nis to murmur silly things about 'heart seizure' and 'inquest on\nFriday.' You ought to be ashamed of yourself, John Cavendish.\"\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\" asked John, unable to help a faint smile.\n\"Dash it all, Evie, I can't haul him down to the local police station\nby the scruff of his neck.\"\n\n\"Well, you might do something. Find out how he did it. He's a crafty\nbeggar. Dare say he soaked fly papers. Ask cook if she's missed any.\"\n\nIt occurred to me very forcibly at that moment that to harbour Miss\nHoward and Alfred Inglethorp under the same roof, and keep the peace\nbetween them, was likely to prove a Herculean task, and I did not envy\nJohn. I could see by the expression of his face that he fully\nappreciated the difficulty of the position. For the moment, he sought\nrefuge in retreat, and left the room precipitately.\n\nDorcas brought in fresh tea. As she left the room, Poirot came over\nfrom the window where he had been standing, and sat down facing Miss\nHoward.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" he said gravely, \"I want to ask you something.\"\n\n\"Ask away,\" said the lady, eyeing him with some disfavour.\n\n\"I want to be able to count upon your help.\"\n\n\"I'll help you to hang Alfred with pleasure,\" she replied gruffly.\n\"Hanging's too good for him. Ought to be drawn and quartered, like in\ngood old times.\"\n\n\"We are at one then,\" said Poirot, \"for I, too, want to hang the\ncriminal.\"\n\n\"Alfred Inglethorp?\"\n\n\"Him, or another.\"\n\n\"No question of another. Poor Emily was never murdered until _he_ came\nalong. I don't say she wasn't surrounded by sharks--she was. But it was\nonly her purse they were after. Her life was safe enough.", "But along\ncomes Mr. Alfred Inglethorp--and within two months--hey presto!\"\n\n\"Believe me, Miss Howard,\" said Poirot very earnestly, \"if Mr.\nInglethorp is the man, he shall not escape me. On my honour, I will\nhang him as high as Haman!\"\n\n\"That's better,\" said Miss Howard more enthusiastically.\n\n\"But I must ask you to trust me. Now your help may be very valuable to\nme. I will tell you why. Because, in all this house of mourning, yours\nare the only eyes that have wept.\"\n\nMiss Howard blinked, and a new note crept into the gruffness of her\nvoice.\n\n\"If you mean that I was fond of her--yes, I was. You know, Emily was a\nselfish old woman in her way. She was very generous, but she always\nwanted a return. She never let people forget what she had done for\nthem--and, that way she missed love. Don't think she ever realized it,\nthough, or felt the lack of it. Hope not, anyway. I was on a different\nfooting. I took my stand from the first. 'So many pounds a year I'm\nworth to you. Well and good. But not a penny piece besides--not a pair\nof gloves, nor a theatre ticket.' She didn't understand--was very\noffended sometimes. Said I was foolishly proud. It wasn't that--but I\ncouldn't explain. Anyway, I kept my self-respect. And so, out of the\nwhole bunch, I was the only one who could allow myself to be fond of\nher. I watched over her. I guarded her from the lot of them, and then a\nglib-tongued scoundrel comes along, and pooh! all my years of devotion\ngo for nothing.\"\n\nPoirot nodded sympathetically.\n\n\"I understand, mademoiselle, I understand all you feel. It is most\nnatural. You think that we are lukewarm--that we lack fire and\nenergy--but trust me, it is not so.\"\n\nJohn stuck his head in at this juncture, and invited us both to come up\nto Mrs. Inglethorp's room, as he and Mr. Wells had finished looking\nthrough the desk in the boudoir.\n\nAs we went up the stairs, John looked back to the dining-room door, and\nlowered his voice confidentially:\n\n\"Look here, what's going to happen when these two meet?\"", "I shook my head helplessly.\n\n\"I've told Mary to keep them apart if she can.\"\n\n\"Will she be able to do so?\"\n\n\"The Lord only knows. There's one thing, Inglethorp himself won't be\ntoo keen on meeting her.\"\n\n\"You've got the keys still, haven't you, Poirot?\" I asked, as we\nreached the door of the locked room.\n\nTaking the keys from Poirot, John unlocked it, and we all passed in.\nThe lawyer went straight to the desk, and John followed him.\n\n\"My mother kept most of her important papers in this despatch-case, I\nbelieve,\" he said.\n\nPoirot drew out the small bunch of keys.\n\n\"Permit me. I locked it, out of precaution, this morning.\"\n\n\"But it's not locked now.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"See.\" And John lifted the lid as he spoke.\n\n\"_Milles tonnerres!_\" cried Poirot, dumbfounded. \"And I--who have both\nthe keys in my pocket!\" He flung himself upon the case. Suddenly he\nstiffened. \"_Eh voila une affaire!_ This lock has been forced.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nPoirot laid down the case again.\n\n\"But who forced it? Why should they? When? But the door was locked?\"\nThese exclamations burst from us disjointedly.\n\nPoirot answered them categorically--almost mechanically.\n\n\"Who? That is the question. Why? Ah, if I only knew. When? Since I was\nhere an hour ago. As to the door being locked, it is a very ordinary\nlock. Probably any other of the doorkeys in this passage would fit it.\"\n\nWe stared at one another blankly. Poirot had walked over to the\nmantelpiece. He was outwardly calm, but I noticed his hands, which from\nlong force of habit were mechanically straightening the spill vases on\nthe mantelpiece, were shaking violently.\n\n\"See here, it was like this,\" he said at last. \"There was something in\nthat case--some piece of evidence, slight in itself perhaps, but still\nenough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime. It was vital\nto him that it should be destroyed before it was discovered and its\nsignificance appreciated. Therefore, he took the risk, the great risk,\nof coming in here. Finding the case locked, he was obliged to force it,\nthus betraying his presence.", "For him to take that risk, it must have\nbeen something of great importance.\"\n\n\"But what was it?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Poirot, with a gesture of anger. \"That, I do not know! A\ndocument of some kind, without doubt, possibly the scrap of paper\nDorcas saw in her hand yesterday afternoon. And I--\" his anger burst\nforth freely--\"miserable animal that I am! I guessed nothing! I have\nbehaved like an imbecile! I should never have left that case here. I\nshould have carried it away with me. Ah, triple pig! And now it is\ngone. It is destroyed--but is it destroyed? Is there not yet a chance--we\nmust leave no stone unturned--\"\n\nHe rushed like a madman from the room, and I followed him as soon as I\nhad sufficiently recovered my wits. But, by the time I had reached the\ntop of the stairs, he was out of sight.\n\nMary Cavendish was standing where the staircase branched, staring down\ninto the hall in the direction in which he had disappeared.\n\n\"What has happened to your extraordinary little friend, Mr. Hastings?\nHe has just rushed past me like a mad bull.\"\n\n\"He's rather upset about something,\" I remarked feebly. I really did\nnot know how much Poirot would wish me to disclose. As I saw a faint\nsmile gather on Mrs. Cavendish's expressive mouth, I endeavoured to try\nand turn the conversation by saying: \"They haven't met yet, have they?\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Mr. Inglethorp and Miss Howard.\"\n\nShe looked at me in rather a disconcerting manner.\n\n\"Do you think it would be such a disaster if they did meet?\"\n\n\"Well, don't you?\" I said, rather taken aback.\n\n\"No.\" She was smiling in her quiet way. \"I should like to see a good\nflare up. It would clear the air. At present we are all thinking so\nmuch, and saying so little.\"\n\n\"John doesn't think so,\" I remarked. \"He's anxious to keep them apart.\"\n\n\"Oh, John!\"\n\nSomething in her tone fired me, and I blurted out:\n\n\"Old John's an awfully good sort.\"\n\nShe studied me curiously for a minute or two, and then said, to my\ngreat surprise:\n\n\"You are loyal to your friend.", "I like you for that.\"\n\n\"Aren't you my friend too?\"\n\n\"I am a very bad friend.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\"\n\n\"Because it is true. I am charming to my friends one day, and forget\nall about them the next.\"\n\nI don't know what impelled me, but I was nettled, and I said foolishly\nand not in the best of taste:\n\n\"Yet you seem to be invariably charming to Dr. Bauerstein!\"\n\nInstantly I regretted my words. Her face stiffened. I had the\nimpression of a steel curtain coming down and blotting out the real\nwoman. Without a word, she turned and went swiftly up the stairs,\nwhilst I stood like an idiot gaping after her.\n\nI was recalled to other matters by a frightful row going on below. I\ncould hear Poirot shouting and expounding. I was vexed to think that my\ndiplomacy had been in vain. The little man appeared to be taking the\nwhole house into his confidence, a proceeding of which I, for one,\ndoubted the wisdom. Once again I could not help regretting that my\nfriend was so prone to lose his head in moments of excitement. I\nstepped briskly down the stairs. The sight of me calmed Poirot almost\nimmediately. I drew him aside.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" I said, \"is this wise? Surely you don't want the\nwhole house to know of this occurrence? You are actually playing into\nthe criminal's hands.\"\n\n\"You think so, Hastings?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"Well, well, my friend, I will be guided by you.\"\n\n\"Good. Although, unfortunately, it is a little too late now.\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\nHe looked so crestfallen and abashed that I felt quite sorry, though I\nstill thought my rebuke a just and wise one.\n\n\"Well,\" he said at last, \"let us go, _mon ami_.\"\n\n\"You have finished here?\"\n\n\"For the moment, yes. You will walk back with me to the village?\"\n\n\"Willingly.\"\n\nHe picked up his little suit-case, and we went out through the open\nwindow in the drawing-room. Cynthia Murdoch was just coming in, and\nPoirot stood aside to let her pass.", "\"Excuse me, mademoiselle, one minute.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" she turned inquiringly.\n\n\"Did you ever make up Mrs. Inglethorp's medicines?\"\n\nA slight flush rose in her face, as she answered rather constrainedly:\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Only her powders?\"\n\nThe flush deepened as Cynthia replied:\n\n\"Oh, yes, I did make up some sleeping powders for her once.\"\n\n\"These?\"\n\nPoirot produced the empty box which had contained powders.\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"Can you tell me what they were? Sulphonal? Veronal?\"\n\n\"No, they were bromide powders.\"\n\n\"Ah! Thank you, mademoiselle; good morning.\"\n\nAs we walked briskly away from the house, I glanced at him more than\nonce. I had often before noticed that, if anything excited him, his\neyes turned green like a cat's. They were shining like emeralds now.\n\n\"My friend,\" he broke out at last, \"I have a little idea, a very\nstrange, and probably utterly impossible idea. And yet--it fits in.\"\n\nI shrugged my shoulders. I privately thought that Poirot was rather too\nmuch given to these fantastic ideas. In this case, surely, the truth\nwas only too plain and apparent.\n\n\"So that is the explanation of the blank label on the box,\" I remarked.\n\"Very simple, as you said. I really wonder that I did not think of it\nmyself.\"\n\nPoirot did not appear to be listening to me.\n\n\"They have made one more discovery, _la-bas_,\" he observed, jerking his\nthumb over his shoulder in the direction of Styles. \"Mr. Wells told me\nas we were going upstairs.\"\n\n\"What was it?\"\n\n\"Locked up in the desk in the boudoir, they found a will of Mrs.\nInglethorp's, dated before her marriage, leaving her fortune to Alfred\nInglethorp. It must have been made just at the time they were engaged.\nIt came quite as a surprise to Wells--and to John Cavendish also. It was\nwritten on one of those printed will forms, and witnessed by two of the\nservants--not Dorcas.\"\n\n\"Did Mr. Inglethorp know of it?\"\n\n\"He says not.\"\n\n\"One might take that with a grain of salt,\" I remarked sceptically.\n\"All these wills are very confusing. Tell me, how did those scribbled\nwords on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made\nyesterday afternoon?\"", "Poirot smiled.\n\n\"_Mon ami_, have you ever, when writing a letter, been arrested by the\nfact that you did not know how to spell a certain word?\"\n\n\"Yes, often. I suppose everyone has.\"\n\n\"Exactly. And have you not, in such a case, tried the word once or\ntwice on the edge of the blotting-paper, or a spare scrap of paper, to\nsee if it looked right? Well, that is what Mrs. Inglethorp did. You\nwill notice that the word 'possessed' is spelt first with one 's' and\nsubsequently with two--correctly. To make sure, she had further tried it\nin a sentence, thus: 'I am possessed.' Now, what did that tell me? It\ntold me that Mrs. Inglethorp had been writing the word 'possessed' that\nafternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh\nin my mind, the possibility of a will--(a document almost certain to\ncontain that word)--occurred to me at once. This possibility was\nconfirmed by a further circumstance. In the general confusion, the\nboudoir had not been swept that morning, and near the desk were several\ntraces of brown mould and earth. The weather had been perfectly fine\nfor some days, and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy\ndeposit.\n\n\"I strolled to the window, and saw at once that the begonia beds had\nbeen newly planted. The mould in the beds was exactly similar to that\non the floor of the boudoir, and also I learnt from you that they _had_\nbeen planted yesterday afternoon. I was now sure that one, or possibly\nboth of the gardeners--for there were two sets of footprints in the\nbed--had entered the boudoir, for if Mrs. Inglethorp had merely wished\nto speak to them she would in all probability have stood at the window,\nand they would not have come into the room at all. I was now quite\nconvinced that she had made a fresh will, and had called the two\ngardeners in to witness her signature. Events proved that I was right\nin my supposition.\"\n\n\"That was very ingenious,\" I could not help admitting.", "\"I must confess\nthat the conclusions I drew from those few scribbled words were quite\nerroneous.\"\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\"You gave too much rein to your imagination. Imagination is a good\nservant, and a bad master. The simplest explanation is always the most\nlikely.\"\n\n\"Another point--how did you know that the key of the despatch-case had\nbeen lost?\"\n\n\"I did not know it. It was a guess that turned out to be correct. You\nobserved that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle. That\nsuggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy\nkey-ring. Now, if it had been lost and recovered, Mrs. Inglethorp would\nat once have replaced it on her bunch; but on her bunch I found what\nwas obviously the duplicate key, very new and bright, which led me to\nthe hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the\nlock of the despatch-case.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"Alfred Inglethorp, without doubt.\"\n\nPoirot looked at me curiously.\n\n\"You are very sure of his guilt?\"\n\n\"Well, naturally. Every fresh circumstance seems to establish it more\nclearly.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" said Poirot quietly, \"there are several points in\nhis favour.\"\n\n\"Oh, come now!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I see only one.\"\n\n\"And that?\"\n\n\"That he was not in the house last night.\"\n\n\"'Bad shot!' as you English say! You have chosen the one point that to\nmy mind tells against him.\"\n\n\"How is that?\"\n\n\"Because if Mr. Inglethorp knew that his wife would be poisoned last\nnight, he would certainly have arranged to be away from the house. His\nexcuse was an obviously trumped up one. That leaves us two\npossibilities: either he knew what was going to happen or he had a\nreason of his own for his absence.\"\n\n\"And that reason?\" I asked sceptically.\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"How should I know? Discreditable, without doubt. This Mr. Inglethorp,\nI should say, is somewhat of a scoundrel--but that does not of necessity\nmake him a murderer.\"\n\nI shook my head, unconvinced.\n\n\"We do not agree, eh?\" said Poirot.", "\"Well, let us leave it. Time will\nshow which of us is right. Now let us turn to other aspects of the\ncase. What do you make of the fact that all the doors of the bedroom\nwere bolted on the inside?\"\n\n\"Well----\" I considered. \"One must look at it logically.\"\n\n\"True.\"\n\n\"I should put it this way. The doors _were_ bolted--our own eyes have\ntold us that--yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor, and\nthe destruction of the will, prove that during the night someone\nentered the room. You agree so far?\"\n\n\"Perfectly. Put with admirable clearness. Proceed.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, encouraged, \"as the person who entered did not do so by\nthe window, nor by miraculous means, it follows that the door must have\nbeen opened from inside by Mrs. Inglethorp herself. That strengthens\nthe conviction that the person in question was her husband. She would\nnaturally open the door to her own husband.\"\n\nPoirot shook his head.\n\n\"Why should she? She had bolted the door leading into his room--a most\nunusual proceeding on her part--she had had a most violent quarrel with\nhim that very afternoon. No, he was the last person she would admit.\"\n\n\"But you agree with me that the door must have been opened by Mrs.\nInglethorp herself?\"\n\n\"There is another possibility. She may have forgotten to bolt the door\ninto the passage when she went to bed, and have got up later, towards\nmorning, and bolted it then.\"\n\n\"Poirot, is that seriously your opinion?\"\n\n\"No, I do not say it is so, but it might be. Now, to turn to another\nfeature, what do you make of the scrap of conversation you overheard\nbetween Mrs. Cavendish and her mother-in-law?\"\n\n\"I had forgotten that,\" I said thoughtfully. \"That is as enigmatical as\never. It seems incredible that a woman like Mrs. Cavendish, proud and\nreticent to the last degree, should interfere so violently in what was\ncertainly not her affair.\"\n\n\"Precisely. It was an astonishing thing for a woman of her breeding to\ndo.\"\n\n\"It is certainly curious,\" I agreed.", "\"Still, it is unimportant, and\nneed not be taken into account.\"\n\nA groan burst from Poirot.\n\n\"What have I always told you? Everything must be taken into account. If\nthe fact will not fit the theory--let the theory go.\"\n\n\"Well, we shall see,\" I said, nettled.\n\n\"Yes, we shall see.\"\n\nWe had reached Leastways Cottage, and Poirot ushered me upstairs to his\nown room. He offered me one of the tiny Russian cigarettes he himself\noccasionally smoked. I was amused to notice that he stowed away the\nused matches most carefully in a little china pot. My momentary\nannoyance vanished.\n\nPoirot had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which\ncommanded a view of the village street. The fresh air blew in warm and\npleasant. It was going to be a hot day.\n\nSuddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing\ndown the street at a great pace. It was the expression on his face that\nwas extraordinary--a curious mingling of terror and agitation.\n\n\"Look, Poirot!\" I said.\n\nHe leant forward.\n\n\"_Tiens!_\" he said. \"It is Mr. Mace, from the chemist's shop. He is\ncoming here.\"\n\nThe young man came to a halt before Leastways Cottage, and, after\nhesitating a moment, pounded vigorously at the door.\n\n\"A little minute,\" cried Poirot from the window. \"I come.\"\n\nMotioning to me to follow him, he ran swiftly down the stairs and\nopened the door. Mr. Mace began at once.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Poirot, I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I heard that\nyou'd just come back from the Hall?\"\n\n\"Yes, we have.\"\n\nThe young man moistened his dry lips. His face was working curiously.\n\n\"It's all over the village about old Mrs. Inglethorp dying so suddenly.\nThey do say--\" he lowered his voice cautiously--\"that it's poison?\"\n\nPoirot's face remained quite impassive.\n\n\"Only the doctors can tell us that, Mr. Mace.\"\n\n\"Yes, exactly--of course----\" The young man hesitated, and then his\nagitation was too much for him. He clutched Poirot by the arm, and sank\nhis voice to a whisper: \"Just tell me this, Mr.", "Poirot, it isn't--it\nisn't strychnine, is it?\"\n\nI hardly heard what Poirot replied. Something evidently of a\nnon-committal nature. The young man departed, and as he closed the door\nPoirot's eyes met mine.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, nodding gravely. \"He will have evidence to give at the\ninquest.\"\n\nWe went slowly upstairs again. I was opening my lips, when Poirot\nstopped me with a gesture of his hand.\n\n\"Not now, not now, _mon ami_. I have need of reflection. My mind is in\nsome disorder--which is not well.\"\n\nFor about ten minutes he sat in dead silence, perfectly still, except\nfor several expressive motions of his eyebrows, and all the time his\neyes grew steadily greener. At last he heaved a deep sigh.\n\n\"It is well. The bad moment has passed. Now all is arranged and\nclassified. One must never permit confusion. The case is not clear\nyet--no. For it is of the most complicated! It puzzles _me_. _Me_,\nHercule Poirot! There are two facts of significance.\"\n\n\"And what are they?\"\n\n\"The first is the state of the weather yesterday. That is very\nimportant.\"\n\n\"But it was a glorious day!\" I interrupted. \"Poirot, you're pulling my\nleg!\"\n\n\"Not at all. The thermometer registered 80 degrees in the shade. Do not\nforget that, my friend. It is the key to the whole riddle!\"\n\n\"And the second point?\" I asked.\n\n\"The important fact that Monsieur Inglethorp wears very peculiar\nclothes, has a black beard, and uses glasses.\"\n\n\"Poirot, I cannot believe you are serious.\"\n\n\"I am absolutely serious, my friend.\"\n\n\"But this is childish!\"\n\n\"No, it is very momentous.\"\n\n\"And supposing the Coroner's jury returns a verdict of Wilful Murder\nagainst Alfred Inglethorp. What becomes of your theories, then?\"\n\n\"They would not be shaken because twelve stupid men had happened to\nmake a mistake! But that will not occur. For one thing, a country jury\nis not anxious to take responsibility upon itself, and Mr. Inglethorp\nstands practically in the position of local squire. Also,\" he added\nplacidly, \"_I_ should not allow it!\"\n\n\"_You_ would not allow it?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nI looked at the extraordinary little man, divided between annoyance and\namusement.", "He was so tremendously sure of himself. As though he read my\nthoughts, he nodded gently.\n\n\"Oh, yes, _mon ami_, I would do what I say.\" He got up and laid his\nhand on my shoulder. His physiognomy underwent a complete change. Tears\ncame into his eyes. \"In all this, you see, I think of that poor Mrs.\nInglethorp who is dead. She was not extravagantly loved--no. But she was\nvery good to us Belgians--I owe her a debt.\"\n\nI endeavoured to interrupt, but Poirot swept on.\n\n\"Let me tell you this, Hastings. She would never forgive me if I let\nAlfred Inglethorp, her husband, be arrested _now_--when a word from me\ncould save him!\"\n\nIn the interval before the inquest, Poirot was unfailing in his\nactivity. Twice he was closeted with Mr. Wells. He also took long walks\ninto the country. I rather resented his not taking me into his\nconfidence, the more so as I could not in the least guess what he was\ndriving at.\n\nIt occurred to me that he might have been making inquiries at Raikes's\nfarm; so, finding him out when I called at Leastways Cottage on\nWednesday evening, I walked over there by the fields, hoping to meet\nhim. But there was no sign of him, and I hesitated to go right up to\nthe farm itself. As I walked away, I met an aged rustic, who leered at\nme cunningly.\n\n\"You'm from the Hall, bain't you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes. I'm looking for a friend of mine whom I thought might have walked\nthis way.\"\n\n\"A little chap? As waves his hands when he talks? One of them Belgies\nfrom the village?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said eagerly. \"He has been here, then?\"\n\n\"Oh, ay, he's been here, right enough. More'n once too. Friend of\nyours, is he? Ah, you gentlemen from the Hall--you'm a pretty lot!\" And\nhe leered more jocosely than ever.\n\n\"Why, do the gentlemen from the Hall come here often?\" I asked, as\ncarelessly as I could.\n\nHe winked at me knowingly.\n\n\"_One_ does, mister. Naming no names, mind.", "And a very liberal\ngentleman too! Oh, thank you, sir, I'm sure.\"\n\nI walked on sharply. Evelyn Howard had been right then, and I\nexperienced a sharp twinge of disgust, as I thought of Alfred\nInglethorp's liberality with another woman's money. Had that piquant\ngipsy face been at the bottom of the crime, or was it the baser\nmainspring of money? Probably a judicious mixture of both.\n\nOn one point, Poirot seemed to have a curious obsession. He once or\ntwice observed to me that he thought Dorcas must have made an error in\nfixing the time of the quarrel. He suggested to her repeatedly that it\nwas four-thirty, and not four o'clock when she had heard the voices.\n\nBut Dorcas was unshaken. Quite an hour, or even more, had elapsed\nbetween the time when she had heard the voices and five o'clock, when\nshe had taken tea to her mistress.\n\nThe inquest was held on Friday at the Stylites Arms in the village.\nPoirot and I sat together, not being required to give evidence.\n\nThe preliminaries were gone through. The jury viewed the body, and John\nCavendish gave evidence of identification.\n\nFurther questioned, he described his awakening in the early hours of\nthe morning, and the circumstances of his mother's death.\n\nThe medical evidence was next taken. There was a breathless hush, and\nevery eye was fixed on the famous London specialist, who was known to\nbe one of the greatest authorities of the day on the subject of\ntoxicology.\n\nIn a few brief words, he summed up the result of the post-mortem. Shorn\nof its medical phraseology and technicalities, it amounted to the fact\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp had met her death as the result of strychnine\npoisoning. Judging from the quantity recovered, she must have taken not\nless than three-quarters of a grain of strychnine, but probably one\ngrain or slightly over.\n\n\"Is it possible that she could have swallowed the poison by accident?\"\nasked the Coroner.\n\n\"I should consider it very unlikely. Strychnine is not used for\ndomestic purposes, as some poisons are, and there are restrictions\nplaced on its sale.\"", "\"Does anything in your examination lead you to determine how the poison\nwas administered?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You arrived at Styles before Dr. Wilkins, I believe?\"\n\n\"That is so. The motor met me just outside the lodge gates, and I\nhurried there as fast as I could.\"\n\n\"Will you relate to us exactly what happened next?\"\n\n\"I entered Mrs. Inglethorp's room. She was at that moment in a typical\ntetanic convulsion. She turned towards me, and gasped out:\n'Alfred--Alfred----'\"\n\n\"Could the strychnine have been administered in Mrs. Inglethorp's\nafter-dinner coffee which was taken to her by her husband?\"\n\n\"Possibly, but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action. The\nsymptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed. It\nis retarded under certain conditions, none of which, however, appear to\nhave been present in this case. I presume Mrs. Inglethorp took the\ncoffee after dinner about eight o'clock, whereas the symptoms did not\nmanifest themselves until the early hours of the morning, which, on the\nface of it, points to the drug having been taken much later in the\nevening.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Inglethorp was in the habit of drinking a cup of cocoa in the\nmiddle of the night. Could the strychnine have been administered in\nthat?\"\n\n\"No, I myself took a sample of the cocoa remaining in the saucepan and\nhad it analysed. There was no strychnine present.\"\n\nI heard Poirot chuckle softly beside me.\n\n\"How did you know?\" I whispered.\n\n\"Listen.\"\n\n\"I should say\"--the doctor was continuing--\"that I would have been\nconsiderably surprised at any other result.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Simply because strychnine has an unusually bitter taste. It can be\ndetected in a solution of one in seventy thousand, and can only be\ndisguised by some strongly flavoured substance. Cocoa would be quite\npowerless to mask it.\"\n\nOne of the jury wanted to know if the same objection applied to coffee.\n\n\"No. Coffee has a bitter taste of its own which would probably cover\nthe taste of strychnine.\"\n\n\"Then you consider it more likely that the drug was administered in the\ncoffee, but that for some unknown reason its action was delayed.\"", "\"Yes, but, the cup being completely smashed, there is no possibility of\nanalyzing its contents.\"\n\nThis concluded Dr. Bauerstein's evidence. Dr. Wilkins corroborated it\non all points. Sounded as to the possibility of suicide, he repudiated\nit utterly. The deceased, he said, suffered from a weak heart, but\notherwise enjoyed perfect health, and was of a cheerful and\nwell-balanced disposition. She would be one of the last people to take\nher own life.\n\nLawrence Cavendish was next called. His evidence was quite unimportant,\nbeing a mere repetition of that of his brother. Just as he was about to\nstep down, he paused, and said rather hesitatingly:\n\n\"I should like to make a suggestion if I may?\"\n\nHe glanced deprecatingly at the Coroner, who replied briskly:\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Cavendish, we are here to arrive at the truth of this\nmatter, and welcome anything that may lead to further elucidation.\"\n\n\"It is just an idea of mine,\" explained Lawrence. \"Of course I may be\nquite wrong, but it still seems to me that my mother's death might be\naccounted for by natural means.\"\n\n\"How do you make that out, Mr. Cavendish?\"\n\n\"My mother, at the time of her death, and for some time before it, was\ntaking a tonic containing strychnine.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the Coroner.\n\nThe jury looked up, interested.\n\n\"I believe,\" continued Lawrence, \"that there have been cases where the\ncumulative effect of a drug, administered for some time, has ended by\ncausing death. Also, is it not possible that she may have taken an\noverdose of her medicine by accident?\"\n\n\"This is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at\nthe time of her death. We are much obliged to you, Mr. Cavendish.\"\n\nDr. Wilkins was recalled and ridiculed the idea.\n\n\"What Mr. Cavendish suggests is quite impossible. Any doctor would tell\nyou the same. Strychnine is, in a certain sense, a cumulative poison,\nbut it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in\nthis way. There would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms\nwhich would at once have attracted my attention.", "The whole thing is\nabsurd.\"\n\n\"And the second suggestion? That Mrs. Inglethorp may have inadvertently\ntaken an overdose?\"\n\n\"Three, or even four doses, would not have resulted in death. Mrs.\nInglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a\ntime, as she dealt with Coot's, the Cash Chemists in Tadminster. She\nwould have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the\namount of strychnine found at the post-mortem.\"\n\n\"Then you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any\nway instrumental in causing her death?\"\n\n\"Certainly. The supposition is ridiculous.\"\n\nThe same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that the\nchemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error.\n\n\"That, of course, is always possible,\" replied the doctor.\n\nBut Dorcas, who was the next witness called, dispelled even that\npossibility. The medicine had not been newly made up. On the contrary,\nMrs. Inglethorp had taken the last dose on the day of her death.\n\nSo the question of the tonic was finally abandoned, and the Coroner\nproceeded with his task. Having elicited from Dorcas how she had been\nawakened by the violent ringing of her mistress's bell, and had\nsubsequently roused the household, he passed to the subject of the\nquarrel on the preceding afternoon.\n\nDorcas's evidence on this point was substantially what Poirot and I had\nalready heard, so I will not repeat it here.\n\nThe next witness was Mary Cavendish. She stood very upright, and spoke\nin a low, clear, and perfectly composed voice. In answer to the\nCoroner's question, she told how, her alarm clock having aroused her at\nfour-thirty as usual, she was dressing, when she was startled by the\nsound of something heavy falling.\n\n\"That would have been the table by the bed?\" commented the Coroner.\n\n\"I opened my door,\" continued Mary, \"and listened. In a few minutes a\nbell rang violently. Dorcas came running down and woke my husband, and\nwe all went to my mother-in-law's room, but it was locked----\"\n\nThe Coroner interrupted her.\n\n\"I really do not think we need trouble you further on that point.", "We\nknow all that can be known of the subsequent happenings. But I should\nbe obliged if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the\nday before.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\nThere was a faint insolence in her voice. She raised her hand and\nadjusted the ruffle of lace at her neck, turning her head a little as\nshe did so. And quite spontaneously the thought flashed across my mind:\n\"She is gaining time!\"\n\n\"Yes. I understand,\" continued the Coroner deliberately, \"that you were\nsitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the\nboudoir. That is so, is it not?\"\n\nThis was news to me and glancing sideways at Poirot, I fancied that it\nwas news to him as well.\n\nThere was the faintest pause, the mere hesitation of a moment, before\nshe answered:\n\n\"Yes, that is so.\"\n\n\"And the boudoir window was open, was it not?\"\n\nSurely her face grew a little paler as she answered:\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then you cannot have failed to hear the voices inside, especially as\nthey were raised in anger. In fact, they would be more audible where\nyou were than in the hall.\"\n\n\"Possibly.\"\n\n\"Will you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel?\"\n\n\"I really do not remember hearing anything.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say you did not hear voices?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I heard the voices, but I did not hear what they said.\" A\nfaint spot of colour came into her cheek. \"I am not in the habit of\nlistening to private conversations.\"\n\nThe Coroner persisted.\n\n\"And you remember nothing at all? _Nothing_, Mrs. Cavendish? Not one\nstray word or phrase to make you realize that it _was_ a private\nconversation?\"\n\nShe paused, and seemed to reflect, still outwardly as calm as ever.\n\n\"Yes; I remember. Mrs. Inglethorp said something--I do not remember\nexactly what--about causing scandal between husband and wife.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" the Coroner leant back satisfied. \"That corresponds with what\nDorcas heard. But excuse me, Mrs. Cavendish, although you realized it\nwas a private conversation, you did not move away? You remained where\nyou were?\"", "I caught the momentary gleam of her tawny eyes as she raised them. I\nfelt certain that at that moment she would willingly have torn the\nlittle lawyer, with his insinuations, into pieces, but she replied\nquietly enough:\n\n\"No. I was very comfortable where I was. I fixed my mind on my book.\"\n\n\"And that is all you can tell us?\"\n\n\"That is all.\"\n\nThe examination was over, though I doubted if the Coroner was entirely\nsatisfied with it. I think he suspected that Mary Cavendish could tell\nmore if she chose.\n\nAmy Hill, shop assistant, was next called, and deposed to having sold a\nwill form on the afternoon of the 17th to William Earl, under-gardener\nat Styles.\n\nWilliam Earl and Manning succeeded her, and testified to witnessing a\ndocument. Manning fixed the time at about four-thirty, William was of\nthe opinion that it was rather earlier.\n\nCynthia Murdoch came next. She had, however, little to tell. She had\nknown nothing of the tragedy, until awakened by Mrs. Cavendish.\n\n\"You did not hear the table fall?\"\n\n\"No. I was fast asleep.\"\n\nThe Coroner smiled.\n\n\"A good conscience makes a sound sleeper,\" he observed. \"Thank you,\nMiss Murdoch, that is all.\"\n\n\"Miss Howard.\"\n\nMiss Howard produced the letter written to her by Mrs. Inglethorp on\nthe evening of the 17th. Poirot and I had, of course already seen it.\nIt added nothing to our knowledge of the tragedy. The following is a\nfacsimile:\n\nSTYLES COURT\nESSEX\nhand written note:\n\n     July 17th\n     My dear Evelyn\n     Can we not bury\n     the hachet? I have\n     found it hard to forgive\n     the things you said\n     against my dear husband\n     but I am an old woman\n     & very fond of you\n     Yours affectionately,\n    Emily Inglethorpe\n\n\nIt was handed to the jury who scrutinized it attentively.\n\n\"I fear it does not help us much,\" said the Coroner, with a sigh.\n\"There is no mention of any of the events of that afternoon.\"\n\n\"Plain as a pikestaff to me,\" said Miss Howard shortly. \"It shows\nclearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out she'd been\nmade a fool of!\"", "\"It says nothing of the kind in the letter,\" the Coroner pointed out.\n\n\"No, because Emily never could bear to put herself in the wrong. But\n_I_ know her. She wanted me back. But she wasn't going to own that I'd\nbeen right. She went round about. Most people do. Don't believe in it\nmyself.\"\n\nMr. Wells smiled faintly. So, I noticed, did several of the jury. Miss\nHoward was obviously quite a public character.\n\n\"Anyway, all this tomfoolery is a great waste of time,\" continued the\nlady, glancing up and down the jury disparagingly. \"Talk--talk--talk!\nWhen all the time we know perfectly well----\"\n\nThe Coroner interrupted her in an agony of apprehension:\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Howard, that is all.\"\n\nI fancy he breathed a sigh of relief when she complied.\n\nThen came the sensation of the day. The Coroner called Albert Mace,\nchemist's assistant.\n\nIt was our agitated young man of the pale face. In answer to the\nCoroner's questions, he explained that he was a qualified pharmacist,\nbut had only recently come to this particular shop, as the assistant\nformerly there had just been called up for the army.\n\nThese preliminaries completed, the Coroner proceeded to business.\n\n\"Mr. Mace, have you lately sold strychnine to any unauthorized person?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"When was this?\"\n\n\"Last Monday night.\"\n\n\"Monday? Not Tuesday?\"\n\n\"No, sir, Monday, the 16th.\"\n\n\"Will you tell us to whom you sold it?\"\n\nYou could have heard a pin drop.\n\n\"Yes, sir. It was to Mr. Inglethorp.\"\n\nEvery eye turned simultaneously to where Alfred Inglethorp was sitting,\nimpassive and wooden. He started slightly, as the damning words fell\nfrom the young man's lips. I half thought he was going to rise from his\nchair, but he remained seated, although a remarkably well acted\nexpression of astonishment rose on his face.\n\n\"You are sure of what you say?\" asked the Coroner sternly.\n\n\"Quite sure, sir.\"\n\n\"Are you in the habit of selling strychnine indiscriminately over the\ncounter?\"\n\nThe wretched young man wilted visibly under the Coroner's frown.\n\n\"Oh, no, sir--of course not. But, seeing it was Mr.", "Inglethorp of the\nHall, I thought there was no harm in it. He said it was to poison a\ndog.\"\n\nInwardly I sympathized. It was only human nature to endeavour to please\n\"The Hall\"--especially when it might result in custom being transferred\nfrom Coot's to the local establishment.\n\n\"Is it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, Mr. Inglethorp did so.\"\n\n\"Have you got the book here?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nIt was produced; and, with a few words of stern censure, the Coroner\ndismissed the wretched Mr. Mace.\n\nThen, amidst a breathless silence, Alfred Inglethorp was called. Did he\nrealize, I wondered, how closely the halter was being drawn around his\nneck?\n\nThe Coroner went straight to the point.\n\n\"On Monday evening last, did you purchase strychnine for the purpose of\npoisoning a dog?\"\n\nInglethorp replied with perfect calmness:\n\n\"No, I did not. There is no dog at Styles, except an outdoor sheepdog,\nwhich is in perfect health.\"\n\n\"You deny absolutely having purchased strychnine from Albert Mace on\nMonday last?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Do you also deny _this_?\"\n\nThe Coroner handed him the register in which his signature was\ninscribed.\n\n\"Certainly I do. The hand-writing is quite different from mine. I will\nshow you.\"\n\nHe took an old envelope out of his pocket, and wrote his name on it,\nhanding it to the jury. It was certainly utterly dissimilar.\n\n\"Then what is your explanation of Mr. Mace's statement?\"\n\nAlfred Inglethorp replied imperturbably:\n\n\"Mr. Mace must have been mistaken.\"\n\nThe Coroner hesitated for a moment, and then said:\n\n\"Mr. Inglethorp, as a mere matter of form, would you mind telling us\nwhere you were on the evening of Monday, July 16th?\"\n\n\"Really--I cannot remember.\"\n\n\"That is absurd, Mr. Inglethorp,\" said the Coroner sharply. \"Think\nagain.\"\n\nInglethorp shook his head.\n\n\"I cannot tell you. I have an idea that I was out walking.\"\n\n\"In what direction?\"\n\n\"I really can't remember.\"\n\nThe Coroner's face grew graver.\n\n\"Were you in company with anyone?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Did you meet anyone on your walk?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"That is a pity,\" said the Coroner dryly.", "\"I am to take it then that\nyou decline to say where you were at the time that Mr. Mace positively\nrecognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine?\"\n\n\"If you like to take it that way, yes.\"\n\n\"Be careful, Mr. Inglethorp.\"\n\nPoirot was fidgeting nervously.\n\n\"_Sacre!_\" he murmured. \"Does this imbecile of a man _want_ to be\narrested?\"\n\nInglethorp was indeed creating a bad impression. His futile denials\nwould not have convinced a child. The Coroner, however, passed briskly\nto the next point, and Poirot drew a deep breath of relief.\n\n\"You had a discussion with your wife on Tuesday afternoon?\"\n\n\"Pardon me,\" interrupted Alfred Inglethorp, \"you have been misinformed.\nI had no quarrel with my dear wife. The whole story is absolutely\nuntrue. I was absent from the house the entire afternoon.\"\n\n\"Have you anyone who can testify to that?\"\n\n\"You have my word,\" said Inglethorp haughtily.\n\nThe Coroner did not trouble to reply.\n\n\"There are two witnesses who will swear to having heard your\ndisagreement with Mrs. Inglethorp.\"\n\n\"Those witnesses were mistaken.\"\n\nI was puzzled. The man spoke with such quiet assurance that I was\nstaggered. I looked at Poirot. There was an expression of exultation on\nhis face which I could not understand. Was he at last convinced of\nAlfred Inglethorp's guilt?\n\n\"Mr. Inglethorp,\" said the Coroner, \"you have heard your wife's dying\nwords repeated here. Can you explain them in any way?\"\n\n\"Certainly I can.\"\n\n\"You can?\"\n\n\"It seems to me very simple. The room was dimly lighted. Dr. Bauerstein\nis much of my height and build, and, like me, wears a beard. In the dim\nlight, and suffering as she was, my poor wife mistook him for me.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" murmured Poirot to himself. \"But it is an idea, that!\"\n\n\"You think it is true?\" I whispered.\n\n\"I do not say that. But it is truly an ingenious supposition.\"\n\n\"You read my wife's last words as an accusation\"--Inglethorp was\ncontinuing--\"they were, on the contrary, an appeal to me.\"\n\nThe Coroner reflected a moment, then he said:\n\n\"I believe, Mr. Inglethorp, that you yourself poured out the coffee,\nand took it to your wife that evening?\"", "\"I poured it out, yes. But I did not take it to her. I meant to do so,\nbut I was told that a friend was at the hall door, so I laid down the\ncoffee on the hall table. When I came through the hall again a few\nminutes later, it was gone.\"\n\nThis statement might, or might not, be true, but it did not seem to me\nto improve matters much for Inglethorp. In any case, he had had ample\ntime to introduce the poison.\n\nAt that point, Poirot nudged me gently, indicating two men who were\nsitting together near the door. One was a little, sharp, dark,\nferret-faced man, the other was tall and fair.\n\nI questioned Poirot mutely. He put his lips to my ear.\n\n\"Do you know who that little man is?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"That is Detective Inspector James Japp of Scotland Yard--Jimmy Japp.\nThe other man is from Scotland Yard too. Things are moving quickly, my\nfriend.\"\n\nI stared at the two men intently. There was certainly nothing of the\npoliceman about them. I should never have suspected them of being\nofficial personages.\n\nI was still staring, when I was startled and recalled by the verdict\nbeing given:\n\n\"Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown.\"\n\nAs we came out of the Stylites Arms, Poirot drew me aside by a gentle\npressure of the arm. I understood his object. He was waiting for the\nScotland Yard men.\n\nIn a few moments, they emerged, and Poirot at once stepped forward, and\naccosted the shorter of the two.\n\n\"I fear you do not remember me, Inspector Japp.\"\n\n\"Why, if it isn't Mr. Poirot!\" cried the Inspector. He turned to the\nother man. \"You've heard me speak of Mr. Poirot? It was in 1904 he and\nI worked together--the Abercrombie forgery case--you remember, he was run\ndown in Brussels. Ah, those were great days, moosier. Then, do you\nremember 'Baron' Altara? There was a pretty rogue for you! He eluded\nthe clutches of half the police in Europe. But we nailed him in\nAntwerp--thanks to Mr.", "Poirot here.\"\n\nAs these friendly reminiscences were being indulged in, I drew nearer,\nand was introduced to Detective-Inspector Japp, who, in his turn,\nintroduced us both to his companion, Superintendent Summerhaye.\n\n\"I need hardly ask what you are doing here, gentlemen,\" remarked\nPoirot.\n\nJapp closed one eye knowingly.\n\n\"No, indeed. Pretty clear case I should say.\"\n\nBut Poirot answered gravely:\n\n\"There I differ from you.\"\n\n\"Oh, come!\" said Summerhaye, opening his lips for the first time.\n\"Surely the whole thing is clear as daylight. The man's caught\nred-handed. How he could be such a fool beats me!\"\n\nBut Japp was looking attentively at Poirot.\n\n\"Hold your fire, Summerhaye,\" he remarked jocularly. \"Me and Moosier\nhere have met before--and there's no man's judgment I'd sooner take than\nhis. If I'm not greatly mistaken, he's got something up his sleeve.\nIsn't that so, moosier?\"\n\nPoirot smiled.\n\n\"I have drawn certain conclusions--yes.\"\n\nSummerhaye was still looking rather sceptical, but Japp continued his\nscrutiny of Poirot.\n\n\"It's this way,\" he said, \"so far, we've only seen the case from the\noutside. That's where the Yard's at a disadvantage in a case of this\nkind, where the murder's only out, so to speak, after the inquest. A\nlot depends on being on the spot first thing, and that's where Mr.\nPoirot's had the start of us. We shouldn't have been here as soon as\nthis even, if it hadn't been for the fact that there was a smart doctor\non the spot, who gave us the tip through the Coroner. But you've been\non the spot from the first, and you may have picked up some little\nhints. From the evidence at the inquest, Mr. Inglethorp murdered his\nwife as sure as I stand here, and if anyone but you hinted the contrary\nI'd laugh in his face. I must say I was surprised the jury didn't bring\nit in Wilful Murder against him right off. I think they would have, if\nit hadn't been for the Coroner--he seemed to be holding them back.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, though, you have a warrant for his arrest in your pocket\nnow,\" suggested Poirot.", "A kind of wooden shutter of officialdom came down from Japp's\nexpressive countenance.\n\n\"Perhaps I have, and perhaps I haven't,\" he remarked dryly.\n\nPoirot looked at him thoughtfully.\n\n\"I am very anxious, Messieurs, that he should not be arrested.\"\n\n\"I dare say,\" observed Summerhaye sarcastically.\n\nJapp was regarding Poirot with comical perplexity.\n\n\"Can't you go a little further, Mr. Poirot? A wink's as good as a\nnod--from you. You've been on the spot--and the Yard doesn't want to make\nany mistakes, you know.\"\n\nPoirot nodded gravely.\n\n\"That is exactly what I thought. Well, I will tell you this. Use your\nwarrant: Arrest Mr. Inglethorp. But it will bring you no kudos--the case\nagainst him will be dismissed at once! _Comme ca!_\" And he snapped his\nfingers expressively.\n\nJapp's face grew grave, though Summerhaye gave an incredulous snort.\n\nAs for me, I was literally dumb with astonishment. I could only\nconclude that Poirot was mad.\n\nJapp had taken out a handkerchief, and was gently dabbing his brow.\n\n\"I daren't do it, Mr. Poirot. _I_'d take your word, but there's others\nover me who'll be asking what the devil I mean by it. Can't you give me\na little more to go on?\"\n\nPoirot reflected a moment.\n\n\"It can be done,\" he said at last. \"I admit I do not wish it. It forces\nmy hand. I would have preferred to work in the dark just for the\npresent, but what you say is very just--the word of a Belgian policeman,\nwhose day is past, is not enough! And Alfred Inglethorp must not be\narrested. That I have sworn, as my friend Hastings here knows. See,\nthen, my good Japp, you go at once to Styles?\"\n\n\"Well, in about half an hour. We're seeing the Coroner and the doctor\nfirst.\"\n\n\"Good. Call for me in passing--the last house in the village. I will go\nwith you. At Styles, Mr. Inglethorp will give you, or if he refuses--as\nis probable--I will give you such proofs that shall satisfy you that the\ncase against him could not possibly be sustained.", "Is that a bargain?\"\n\n\"That's a bargain,\" said Japp heartily. \"And, on behalf of the Yard,\nI'm much obliged to you, though I'm bound to confess I can't at present\nsee the faintest possible loop-hole in the evidence, but you always\nwere a marvel! So long, then, moosier.\"\n\nThe two detectives strode away, Summerhaye with an incredulous grin on\nhis face.\n\n\"Well, my friend,\" cried Poirot, before I could get in a word, \"what do\nyou think? _Mon Dieu!_ I had some warm moments in that court; I did not\nfigure to myself that the man would be so pig-headed as to refuse to\nsay anything at all. Decidedly, it was the policy of an imbecile.\"\n\n\"H'm! There are other explanations besides that of imbecility,\" I\nremarked. \"For, if the case against him is true, how could he defend\nhimself except by silence?\"\n\n\"Why, in a thousand ingenious ways,\" cried Poirot. \"See; say that it is\nI who have committed this murder, I can think of seven most plausible\nstories! Far more convincing than Mr. Inglethorp's stony denials!\"\n\nI could not help laughing.\n\n\"My dear Poirot, I am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy! But,\nseriously, in spite of what I heard you say to the detectives, you\nsurely cannot still believe in the possibility of Alfred Inglethorp's\ninnocence?\"\n\n\"Why not now as much as before? Nothing has changed.\"\n\n\"But the evidence is so conclusive.\"\n\n\"Yes, too conclusive.\"\n\nWe turned in at the gate of Leastways Cottage, and proceeded up the now\nfamiliar stairs.\n\n\"Yes, yes, too conclusive,\" continued Poirot, almost to himself. \"Real\nevidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory. It has to be\nexamined--sifted. But here the whole thing is cut and dried. No, my\nfriend, this evidence has been very cleverly manufactured--so cleverly\nthat it has defeated its own ends.\"\n\n\"How do you make that out?\"\n\n\"Because, so long as the evidence against him was vague and intangible,\nit was very hard to disprove. But, in his anxiety, the criminal has\ndrawn the net so closely that one cut will set Inglethorp free.\"", "I was silent. And in a minute or two, Poirot continued:\n\n\"Let us look at the matter like this. Here is a man, let us say, who\nsets out to poison his wife. He has lived by his wits as the saying\ngoes. Presumably, therefore, he has some wits. He is not altogether a\nfool. Well, how does he set about it? He goes boldly to the village\nchemist's and purchases strychnine under his own name, with a trumped\nup story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd. He does not\nemploy the poison that night. No, he waits until he has had a violent\nquarrel with her, of which the whole household is cognisant, and which\nnaturally directs their suspicions upon him. He prepares no defence--no\nshadow of an alibi, yet he knows the chemist's assistant must\nnecessarily come forward with the facts. Bah! Do not ask me to believe\nthat any man could be so idiotic! Only a lunatic, who wished to commit\nsuicide by causing himself to be hanged, would act so!\"\n\n\"Still--I do not see----\" I began.\n\n\"Neither do I see. I tell you, _mon ami_, it puzzles me. _Me_--Hercule\nPoirot!\"\n\n\"But if you believe him innocent, how do you explain his buying the\nstrychnine?\"\n\n\"Very simply. He did _not_ buy it.\"\n\n\"But Mace recognized him!\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, he saw a man with a black beard like Mr.\nInglethorp's, and wearing glasses like Mr. Inglethorp, and dressed in\nMr. Inglethorp's rather noticeable clothes. He could not recognize a\nman whom he had probably only seen in the distance, since, you\nremember, he himself had only been in the village a fortnight, and Mrs.\nInglethorp dealt principally with Coot's in Tadminster.\"\n\n\"Then you think----\"\n\n\"_Mon ami_, do you remember the two points I laid stress upon? Leave\nthe first one for the moment, what was the second?\"\n\n\"The important fact that Alfred Inglethorp wears peculiar clothes, has\na black beard, and uses glasses,\" I quoted.\n\n\"Exactly. Now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as John or\nLawrence Cavendish.", "Would it be easy?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said thoughtfully. \"Of course an actor----\"\n\nBut Poirot cut me short ruthlessly.\n\n\"And why would it not be easy? I will tell you, my friend: Because they\nare both clean-shaven men. To make up successfully as one of these two\nin broad daylight, it would need an actor of genius, and a certain\ninitial facial resemblance. But in the case of Alfred Inglethorp, all\nthat is changed. His clothes, his beard, the glasses which hide his\neyes--those are the salient points about his personal appearance. Now,\nwhat is the first instinct of the criminal? To divert suspicion from\nhimself, is it not so? And how can he best do that? By throwing it on\nsomeone else. In this instance, there was a man ready to his hand.\nEverybody was predisposed to believe in Mr. Inglethorp's guilt. It was\na foregone conclusion that he would be suspected; but, to make it a\nsure thing there must be tangible proof--such as the actual buying of\nthe poison, and that, with a man of the peculiar appearance of Mr.\nInglethorp, was not difficult. Remember, this young Mace had never\nactually spoken to Mr. Inglethorp. How should he doubt that the man in\nhis clothes, with his beard and his glasses, was not Alfred\nInglethorp?\"\n\n\"It may be so,\" I said, fascinated by Poirot's eloquence. \"But, if that\nwas the case, why does he not say where he was at six o'clock on Monday\nevening?\"\n\n\"Ah, why indeed?\" said Poirot, calming down. \"If he were arrested, he\nprobably would speak, but I do not want it to come to that. I must make\nhim see the gravity of his position. There is, of course, something\ndiscreditable behind his silence. If he did not murder his wife, he is,\nnevertheless, a scoundrel, and has something of his own to conceal,\nquite apart from the murder.\"\n\n\"What can it be?\" I mused, won over to Poirot's views for the moment,\nalthough still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction\nwas the correct one.\n\n\"Can you not guess?\"", "asked Poirot, smiling.\n\n\"No, can you?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I had a little idea sometime ago--and it has turned out to be\ncorrect.\"\n\n\"You never told me,\" I said reproachfully.\n\nPoirot spread out his hands apologetically.\n\n\"Pardon me, _mon ami_, you were not precisely _sympathique_.\" He turned\nto me earnestly. \"Tell me--you see now that he must not be arrested?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" I said doubtfully, for I was really quite indifferent to the\nfate of Alfred Inglethorp, and thought that a good fright would do him\nno harm.\n\nPoirot, who was watching me intently, gave a sigh.\n\n\"Come, my friend,\" he said, changing the subject, \"apart from Mr.\nInglethorp, how did the evidence at the inquest strike you?\"\n\n\"Oh, pretty much what I expected.\"\n\n\"Did nothing strike you as peculiar about it?\"\n\nMy thoughts flew to Mary Cavendish, and I hedged:\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish's evidence for instance?\"\n\nI was relieved.\n\n\"Oh, Lawrence! No, I don't think so. He's always a nervous chap.\"\n\n\"His suggestion that his mother might have been poisoned accidentally\nby means of the tonic she was taking, that did not strike you as\nstrange-- _hein?_\"\n\n\"No, I can't say it did. The doctors ridiculed it of course. But it was\nquite a natural suggestion for a layman to make.\"\n\n\"But Monsieur Lawrence is not a layman. You told me yourself that he\nhad started by studying medicine, and that he had taken his degree.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's true. I never thought of that.\" I was rather startled. \"It\n_is_ odd.\"\n\nPoirot nodded.\n\n\"From the first, his behaviour has been peculiar. Of all the household,\nhe alone would be likely to recognize the symptoms of strychnine\npoisoning, and yet we find him the only member of the family to uphold\nstrenuously the theory of death from natural causes. If it had been\nMonsieur John, I could have understood it. He has no technical\nknowledge, and is by nature unimaginative. But Monsieur Lawrence--no!\nAnd now, to-day, he puts forward a suggestion that he himself must have\nknown was ridiculous. There is food for thought in this, _mon ami!_\"\n\n\"It's very confusing,\" I agreed.", "\"Then there is Mrs. Cavendish,\" continued Poirot. \"That's another who\nis not telling all she knows! What do you make of her attitude?\"\n\n\"I don't know what to make of it. It seems inconceivable that she\nshould be shielding Alfred Inglethorp. Yet that is what it looks like.\"\n\nPoirot nodded reflectively.\n\n\"Yes, it is queer. One thing is certain, she overheard a good deal more\nof that 'private conversation' than she was willing to admit.\"\n\n\"And yet she is the last person one would accuse of stooping to\neavesdrop!\"\n\n\"Exactly. One thing her evidence _has_ shown me. I made a mistake.\nDorcas was quite right. The quarrel did take place earlier in the\nafternoon, about four o'clock, as she said.\"\n\nI looked at him curiously. I had never understood his insistence on\nthat point.\n\n\"Yes, a good deal that was peculiar came out to-day,\" continued Poirot.\n\"Dr. Bauerstein, now, what was _he_ doing up and dressed at that hour\nin the morning? It is astonishing to me that no one commented on the\nfact.\"\n\n\"He has insomnia, I believe,\" I said doubtfully.\n\n\"Which is a very good, or a very bad explanation,\" remarked Poirot. \"It\ncovers everything, and explains nothing. I shall keep my eye on our\nclever Dr. Bauerstein.\"\n\n\"Any more faults to find with the evidence?\" I inquired satirically.\n\n\"_Mon ami_,\" replied Poirot gravely, \"when you find that people are not\ntelling you the truth--look out! Now, unless I am much mistaken, at the\ninquest to-day only one--at most, two persons were speaking the truth\nwithout reservation or subterfuge.\"\n\n\"Oh, come now, Poirot! I won't cite Lawrence, or Mrs. Cavendish. But\nthere's John--and Miss Howard, surely they were speaking the truth?\"\n\n\"Both of them, my friend? One, I grant you, but both----!\"\n\nHis words gave me an unpleasant shock. Miss Howard's evidence,\nunimportant as it was, had been given in such a downright\nstraightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt her\nsincerity. Still, I had a great respect for Poirot's sagacity--except on\nthe occasions when he was what I described to myself as \"foolishly\npig-headed.\"", "\"Do you really think so?\" I asked. \"Miss Howard had always seemed to me\nso essentially honest--almost uncomfortably so.\"\n\nPoirot gave me a curious look, which I could not quite fathom. He\nseemed to speak, and then checked himself.\n\n\"Miss Murdoch too,\" I continued, \"there's nothing untruthful about\n_her_.\"\n\n\"No. But it was strange that she never heard a sound, sleeping next\ndoor; whereas Mrs. Cavendish, in the other wing of the building,\ndistinctly heard the table fall.\"\n\n\"Well, she's young. And she sleeps soundly.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, indeed! She must be a famous sleeper, that one!\"\n\nI did not quite like the tone of his voice, but at that moment a smart\nknock reached our ears, and looking out of the window we perceived the\ntwo detectives waiting for us below.\n\nPoirot seized his hat, gave a ferocious twist to his moustache, and,\ncarefully brushing an imaginary speck of dust from his sleeve, motioned\nme to precede him down the stairs; there we joined the detectives and\nset out for Styles.\n\nI think the appearance of the two Scotland Yard men was rather a\nshock--especially to John, though of course after the verdict, he had\nrealized that it was only a matter of time. Still, the presence of the\ndetectives brought the truth home to him more than anything else could\nhave done.\n\nPoirot had conferred with Japp in a low tone on the way up, and it was\nthe latter functionary who requested that the household, with the\nexception of the servants, should be assembled together in the\ndrawing-room. I realized the significance of this. It was up to Poirot\nto make his boast good.\n\nPersonally, I was not sanguine. Poirot might have excellent reasons for\nhis belief in Inglethorp's innocence, but a man of the type of\nSummerhaye would require tangible proofs, and these I doubted if Poirot\ncould supply.\n\nBefore very long we had all trooped into the drawing-room, the door of\nwhich Japp closed. Poirot politely set chairs for everyone. The\nScotland Yard men were the cynosure of all eyes. I think that for the\nfirst time we realized that the thing was not a bad dream, but a\ntangible reality.", "We had read of such things--now we ourselves were\nactors in the drama. To-morrow the daily papers, all over England,\nwould blazon out the news in staring headlines:\n\n\"MYSTERIOUS TRAGEDY IN ESSEX\"\n\n    \"WEALTHY LADY POISONED\"\n\n\nThere would be pictures of Styles, snap-shots of \"The family leaving\nthe Inquest\"--the village photographer had not been idle! All the things\nthat one had read a hundred times--things that happen to other people,\nnot to oneself. And now, in this house, a murder had been committed. In\nfront of us were \"the detectives in charge of the case.\" The well-known\nglib phraseology passed rapidly through my mind in the interval before\nPoirot opened the proceedings.\n\nI think everyone was a little surprised that it should be he and not\none of the official detectives who took the initiative.\n\n\"_Mesdames_ and _messieurs_,\" said Poirot, bowing as though he were a\ncelebrity about to deliver a lecture, \"I have asked you to come here\nall together, for a certain object. That object, it concerns Mr. Alfred\nInglethorp.\"\n\nInglethorp was sitting a little by himself--I think, unconsciously,\neveryone had drawn his chair slightly away from him--and he gave a faint\nstart as Poirot pronounced his name.\n\n\"Mr. Inglethorp,\" said Poirot, addressing him directly, \"a very dark\nshadow is resting on this house--the shadow of murder.\"\n\nInglethorp shook his head sadly.\n\n\"My poor wife,\" he murmured. \"Poor Emily! It is terrible.\"\n\n\"I do not think, monsieur,\" said Poirot pointedly, \"that you quite\nrealize how terrible it may be--for you.\" And as Inglethorp did not\nappear to understand, he added: \"Mr. Inglethorp, you are standing in\nvery grave danger.\"\n\nThe two detectives fidgeted. I saw the official caution \"Anything you\nsay will be used in evidence against you,\" actually hovering on\nSummerhaye's lips. Poirot went on.\n\n\"Do you understand now, monsieur?\"\n\n\"No. What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean,\" said Poirot deliberately, \"that you are suspected of\npoisoning your wife.\"\n\nA little gasp ran round the circle at this plain speaking.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Inglethorp, starting up. \"What a monstrous idea!", "_I_--poison my dearest Emily!\"\n\n\"I do not think\"--Poirot watched him narrowly--\"that you quite realize\nthe unfavourable nature of your evidence at the inquest. Mr.\nInglethorp, knowing what I have now told you, do you still refuse to\nsay where you were at six o'clock on Monday afternoon?\"\n\nWith a groan, Alfred Inglethorp sank down again and buried his face in\nhis hands. Poirot approached and stood over him.\n\n\"Speak!\" he cried menacingly.\n\nWith an effort, Inglethorp raised his face from his hands. Then, slowly\nand deliberately, he shook his head.\n\n\"You will not speak?\"\n\n\"No. I do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me\nof what you say.\"\n\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully, like a man whose mind is made up.\n\n\"_Soit!_\" he said. \"Then I must speak for you.\"\n\nAlfred Inglethorp sprang up again.\n\n\"You? How can you speak? You do not know----\" he broke off abruptly.\n\nPoirot turned to face us. \"_Mesdames_ and _messieurs_! I speak! Listen!\nI, Hercule Poirot, affirm that the man who entered the chemist's shop,\nand purchased strychnine at six o'clock on Monday last was not Mr.\nInglethorp, for at six o'clock on that day Mr. Inglethorp was escorting\nMrs. Raikes back to her home from a neighbouring farm. I can produce no\nless than five witnesses to swear to having seen them together, either\nat six or just after and, as you may know, the Abbey Farm, Mrs.\nRaikes's home, is at least two and a half miles distant from the\nvillage. There is absolutely no question as to the alibi!\"\n\nThere was a moment's stupefied silence. Japp, who was the least\nsurprised of any of us, was the first to speak.\n\n\"My word,\" he cried, \"you're the goods! And no mistake, Mr. Poirot!\nThese witnesses of yours are all right, I suppose?\"\n\n\"_Voila!_ I have prepared a list of them--names and addresses. You must\nsee them, of course. But you will find it all right.\"\n\n\"I'm sure of that.\" Japp lowered his voice. \"I'm much obliged to you. A\npretty mare's nest arresting him would have been.\"", "He turned to\nInglethorp. \"But, if you'll excuse me, sir, why couldn't you say all\nthis at the inquest?\"\n\n\"I will tell you why,\" interrupted Poirot. \"There was a certain\nrumour----\"\n\n\"A most malicious and utterly untrue one,\" interrupted Alfred\nInglethorp in an agitated voice.\n\n\"And Mr. Inglethorp was anxious to have no scandal revived just at\npresent. Am I right?\"\n\n\"Quite right.\" Inglethorp nodded. \"With my poor Emily not yet buried,\ncan you wonder I was anxious that no more lying rumours should be\nstarted.\"\n\n\"Between you and me, sir,\" remarked Japp, \"I'd sooner have any amount\nof rumours than be arrested for murder. And I venture to think your\npoor lady would have felt the same. And, if it hadn't been for Mr.\nPoirot here, arrested you would have been, as sure as eggs is eggs!\"\n\n\"I was foolish, no doubt,\" murmured Inglethorp. \"But you do not know,\ninspector, how I have been persecuted and maligned.\" And he shot a\nbaleful glance at Evelyn Howard.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" said Japp, turning briskly to John, \"I should like to see\nthe lady's bedroom, please, and after that I'll have a little chat with\nthe servants. Don't you bother about anything. Mr. Poirot, here, will\nshow me the way.\"\n\nAs they all went out of the room, Poirot turned and made me a sign to\nfollow him upstairs. There he caught me by the arm, and drew me aside.\n\n\"Quick, go to the other wing. Stand there--just this side of the baize\ndoor. Do not move till I come.\" Then, turning rapidly, he rejoined the\ntwo detectives.\n\nI followed his instructions, taking up my position by the baize door,\nand wondering what on earth lay behind the request. Why was I to stand\nin this particular spot on guard? I looked thoughtfully down the\ncorridor in front of me. An idea struck me. With the exception of\nCynthia Murdoch's, everyone's room was in this left wing. Had that\nanything to do with it? Was I to report who came or went? I stood\nfaithfully at my post. The minutes passed.", "Nobody came. Nothing\nhappened.\n\nIt must have been quite twenty minutes before Poirot rejoined me.\n\n\"You have not stirred?\"\n\n\"No, I've stuck here like a rock. Nothing's happened.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Was he pleased, or disappointed? \"You've seen nothing at all?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But you have probably heard something? A big bump--eh, _mon ami?_\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Is it possible? Ah, but I am vexed with myself! I am not usually\nclumsy. I made but a slight gesture\"--I know Poirot's gestures--\"with the\nleft hand, and over went the table by the bed!\"\n\nHe looked so childishly vexed and crest-fallen that I hastened to\nconsole him.\n\n\"Never mind, old chap. What does it matter? Your triumph downstairs\nexcited you. I can tell you, that was a surprise to us all. There must\nbe more in this affair of Inglethorp's with Mrs. Raikes than we\nthought, to make him hold his tongue so persistently. What are you\ngoing to do now? Where are the Scotland Yard fellows?\"\n\n\"Gone down to interview the servants. I showed them all our exhibits. I\nam disappointed in Japp. He has no method!\"\n\n\"Hullo!\" I said, looking out of the window. \"Here's Dr. Bauerstein. I\nbelieve you're right about that man, Poirot. I don't like him.\"\n\n\"He is clever,\" observed Poirot meditatively.\n\n\"Oh, clever as the devil! I must say I was overjoyed to see him in the\nplight he was in on Tuesday. You never saw such a spectacle!\" And I\ndescribed the doctor's adventure. \"He looked a regular scarecrow!\nPlastered with mud from head to foot.\"\n\n\"You saw him, then?\"\n\n\"Yes. Of course, he didn't want to come in--it was just after dinner--but\nMr. Inglethorp insisted.\"\n\n\"What?\" Poirot caught me violently by the shoulders. \"Was Dr.\nBauerstein here on Tuesday evening? Here? And you never told me? Why\ndid you not tell me? Why? Why?\"\n\nHe appeared to be in an absolute frenzy.\n\n\"My dear Poirot,\" I expostulated, \"I never thought it would interest\nyou. I didn't know it was of any importance.\"\n\n\"Importance? It is of the first importance! So Dr. Bauerstein was here\non Tuesday night--the night of the murder.", "Hastings, do you not see?\nThat alters everything--everything!\"\n\nI had never seen him so upset. Loosening his hold of me, he\nmechanically straightened a pair of candlesticks, still murmuring to\nhimself: \"Yes, that alters everything--everything.\"\n\nSuddenly he seemed to come to a decision.\n\n\"_Allons!_\" he said. \"We must act at once. Where is Mr. Cavendish?\"\n\nJohn was in the smoking-room. Poirot went straight to him.\n\n\"Mr. Cavendish, I have some important business in Tadminster. A new\nclue. May I take your motor?\"\n\n\"Why, of course. Do you mean at once?\"\n\n\"If you please.\"\n\nJohn rang the bell, and ordered round the car. In another ten minutes,\nwe were racing down the park and along the high road to Tadminster.\n\n\"Now, Poirot,\" I remarked resignedly, \"perhaps you will tell me what\nall this is about?\"\n\n\"Well, _mon ami_, a good deal you can guess for yourself. Of course you\nrealize that, now Mr. Inglethorp is out of it, the whole position is\ngreatly changed. We are face to face with an entirely new problem. We\nknow now that there is one person who did not buy the poison. We have\ncleared away the manufactured clues. Now for the real ones. I have\nascertained that anyone in the household, with the exception of Mrs.\nCavendish, who was playing tennis with you, could have personated Mr.\nInglethorp on Monday evening. In the same way, we have his statement\nthat he put the coffee down in the hall. No one took much notice of\nthat at the inquest--but now it has a very different significance. We\nmust find out who did take that coffee to Mrs. Inglethorp eventually,\nor who passed through the hall whilst it was standing there. From your\naccount, there are only two people whom we can positively say did not\ngo near the coffee--Mrs. Cavendish, and Mademoiselle Cynthia.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is so.\" I felt an inexpressible lightening of the heart.\nMary Cavendish could certainly not rest under suspicion.\n\n\"In clearing Alfred Inglethorp,\" continued Poirot, \"I have been obliged\nto show my hand sooner than I intended.", "As long as I might be thought\nto be pursuing him, the criminal would be off his guard. Now, he will\nbe doubly careful. Yes--doubly careful.\" He turned to me abruptly. \"Tell\nme, Hastings, you yourself--have you no suspicions of anybody?\"\n\nI hesitated. To tell the truth, an idea, wild and extravagant in\nitself, had once or twice that morning flashed through my brain. I had\nrejected it as absurd, nevertheless it persisted.\n\n\"You couldn't call it a suspicion,\" I murmured. \"It's so utterly\nfoolish.\"\n\n\"Come now,\" urged Poirot encouragingly. \"Do not fear. Speak your mind.\nYou should always pay attention to your instincts.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" I blurted out, \"it's absurd--but I suspect Miss Howard of\nnot telling all she knows!\"\n\n\"Miss Howard?\"\n\n\"Yes--you'll laugh at me----\"\n\n\"Not at all. Why should I?\"\n\n\"I can't help feeling,\" I continued blunderingly; \"that we've rather\nleft her out of the possible suspects, simply on the strength of her\nhaving been away from the place. But, after all, she was only fifteen\nmiles away. A car would do it in half an hour. Can we say positively\nthat she was away from Styles on the night of the murder?\"\n\n\"Yes, my friend,\" said Poirot unexpectedly, \"we can. One of my first\nactions was to ring up the hospital where she was working.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, I learnt that Miss Howard had been on afternoon duty on Tuesday,\nand that--a convoy coming in unexpectedly--she had kindly offered to\nremain on night duty, which offer was gratefully accepted. That\ndisposes of that.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" I said, rather nonplussed. \"Really,\" I continued, \"it's her\nextraordinary vehemence against Inglethorp that started me off\nsuspecting her. I can't help feeling she'd do anything against him. And\nI had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the\nwill. She might have burnt the new one, mistaking it for the earlier\none in his favour. She is so terribly bitter against him.\"\n\n\"You consider her vehemence unnatural?\"\n\n\"Y--es. She is so very violent. I wondered really whether she is quite\nsane on that point.\"", "Poirot shook his head energetically.\n\n\"No, no, you are on a wrong tack there. There is nothing weak-minded or\ndegenerate about Miss Howard. She is an excellent specimen of\nwell-balanced English beef and brawn. She is sanity itself.\"\n\n\"Yet her hatred of Inglethorp seems almost a mania. My idea was--a very\nridiculous one, no doubt--that she had intended to poison him--and that,\nin some way, Mrs. Inglethorp got hold of it by mistake. But I don't at\nall see how it could have been done. The whole thing is absurd and\nridiculous to the last degree.\"\n\n\"Still you are right in one thing. It is always wise to suspect\neverybody until you can prove logically, and to your own satisfaction,\nthat they are innocent. Now, what reasons are there against Miss\nHoward's having deliberately poisoned Mrs. Inglethorp?\"\n\n\"Why, she was devoted to her!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Tcha! Tcha!\" cried Poirot irritably. \"You argue like a child. If Miss\nHoward were capable of poisoning the old lady, she would be quite\nequally capable of simulating devotion. No, we must look elsewhere. You\nare perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against\nAlfred Inglethorp is too violent to be natural; but you are quite wrong\nin the deduction you draw from it. I have drawn my own deductions,\nwhich I believe to be correct, but I will not speak of them at\npresent.\" He paused a minute, then went on. \"Now, to my way of\nthinking, there is one insuperable objection to Miss Howard's being the\nmurderess.\"\n\n\"And that is?\"\n\n\"That in no possible way could Mrs. Inglethorp's death benefit Miss\nHoward. Now there is no murder without a motive.\"\n\nI reflected.\n\n\"Could not Mrs. Inglethorp have made a will in her favour?\"\n\nPoirot shook his head.\n\n\"But you yourself suggested that possibility to Mr. Wells?\"\n\nPoirot smiled.\n\n\"That was for a reason. I did not want to mention the name of the\nperson who was actually in my mind. Miss Howard occupied very much the\nsame position, so I used her name instead.\"\n\n\"Still, Mrs. Inglethorp might have done so.", "Why, that will, made on the\nafternoon of her death may----\"\n\nBut Poirot's shake of the head was so energetic that I stopped.\n\n\"No, my friend. I have certain little ideas of my own about that will.\nBut I can tell you this much--it was not in Miss Howard's favour.\"\n\nI accepted his assurance, though I did not really see how he could be\nso positive about the matter.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, with a sigh, \"we will acquit Miss Howard, then. It is\npartly your fault that I ever came to suspect her. It was what you said\nabout her evidence at the inquest that set me off.\"\n\nPoirot looked puzzled.\n\n\"What did I say about her evidence at the inquest?\"\n\n\"Don't you remember? When I cited her and John Cavendish as being above\nsuspicion?\"\n\n\"Oh--ah--yes.\" He seemed a little confused, but recovered himself. \"By\nthe way, Hastings, there is something I want you to do for me.\"\n\n\"Certainly. What is it?\"\n\n\"Next time you happen to be alone with Lawrence Cavendish, I want you\nto say this to him. 'I have a message for you, from Poirot. He says:\n\"Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace!\"' Nothing more.\nNothing less.\"\n\n\"'Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.' Is that\nright?\" I asked, much mystified.\n\n\"Excellent.\"\n\n\"But what does it mean?\"\n\n\"Ah, that I will leave you to find out. You have access to the facts.\nJust say that to him, and see what he says.\"\n\n\"Very well--but it's all extremely mysterious.\"\n\nWe were running into Tadminster now, and Poirot directed the car to the\n\"Analytical Chemist.\"\n\nPoirot hopped down briskly, and went inside. In a few minutes he was\nback again.\n\n\"There,\" he said. \"That is all my business.\"\n\n\"What were you doing there?\" I asked, in lively curiosity.\n\n\"I left something to be analysed.\"\n\n\"Yes, but what?\"\n\n\"The sample of cocoa I took from the saucepan in the bedroom.\"\n\n\"But that has already been tested!\" I cried, stupefied. \"Dr. Bauerstein\nhad it tested, and you yourself laughed at the possibility of there\nbeing strychnine in it.\"", "\"I know Dr. Bauerstein had it tested,\" replied Poirot quietly.\n\n\"Well, then?\"\n\n\"Well, I have a fancy for having it analysed again, that is all.\"\n\nAnd not another word on the subject could I drag out of him.\n\nThis proceeding of Poirot's, in respect of the cocoa, puzzled me\nintensely. I could see neither rhyme nor reason in it. However, my\nconfidence in him, which at one time had rather waned, was fully\nrestored since his belief in Alfred Inglethorp's innocence had been so\ntriumphantly vindicated.\n\nThe funeral of Mrs. Inglethorp took place the following day, and on\nMonday, as I came down to a late breakfast, John drew me aside, and\ninformed me that Mr. Inglethorp was leaving that morning, to take up\nhis quarters at the Stylites Arms until he should have completed his\nplans.\n\n\"And really it's a great relief to think he's going, Hastings,\"\ncontinued my honest friend. \"It was bad enough before, when we thought\nhe'd done it, but I'm hanged if it isn't worse now, when we all feel\nguilty for having been so down on the fellow. The fact is, we've\ntreated him abominably. Of course, things did look black against him. I\ndon't see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we\ndid. Still, there it is, we were in the wrong, and now there's a\nbeastly feeling that one ought to make amends; which is difficult, when\none doesn't like the fellow a bit better than one did before. The whole\nthing's damned awkward! And I'm thankful he's had the tact to take\nhimself off. It's a good thing Styles wasn't the mater's to leave to\nhim. Couldn't bear to think of the fellow lording it here. He's welcome\nto her money.\"\n\n\"You'll be able to keep up the place all right?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, yes. There are the death duties, of course, but half my father's\nmoney goes with the place, and Lawrence will stay with us for the\npresent, so there is his share as well. We shall be pinched at first,\nof course, because, as I once told you, I am in a bit of a hole\nfinancially myself.", "Still, the Johnnies will wait now.\"\n\nIn the general relief at Inglethorp's approaching departure, we had the\nmost genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy. Cynthia,\nwhose young spirits were naturally buoyant, was looking quite her\npretty self again, and we all, with the exception of Lawrence, who\nseemed unalterably gloomy and nervous, were quietly cheerful, at the\nopening of a new and hopeful future.\n\nThe papers, of course, had been full of the tragedy. Glaring headlines,\nsandwiched biographies of every member of the household, subtle\ninnuendoes, the usual familiar tag about the police having a clue.\nNothing was spared us. It was a slack time. The war was momentarily\ninactive, and the newspapers seized with avidity on this crime in\nfashionable life: \"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\" was the topic of\nthe moment.\n\nNaturally it was very annoying for the Cavendishes. The house was\nconstantly besieged by reporters, who were consistently denied\nadmission, but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds,\nwhere they lay in wait with cameras, for any unwary members of the\nhousehold. We all lived in a blast of publicity. The Scotland Yard men\ncame and went, examining, questioning, lynx-eyed and reserved of\ntongue. Towards what end they were working, we did not know. Had they\nany clue, or would the whole thing remain in the category of\nundiscovered crimes?\n\nAfter breakfast, Dorcas came up to me rather mysteriously, and asked if\nshe might have a few words with me.\n\n\"Certainly. What is it, Dorcas?\"\n\n\"Well, it's just this, sir. You'll be seeing the Belgian gentleman\nto-day perhaps?\" I nodded. \"Well, sir, you know how he asked me so\nparticular if the mistress, or anyone else, had a green dress?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. You have found one?\" My interest was aroused.\n\n\"No, not that, sir. But since then I've remembered what the young\ngentlemen\"--John and Lawrence were still the \"young gentlemen\" to\nDorcas--\"call the 'dressing-up box.' It's up in the front attic, sir. A\ngreat chest, full of old clothes and fancy dresses, and what not. And\nit came to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst\nthem.", "So, if you'd tell the Belgian gentleman----\"\n\n\"I will tell him, Dorcas,\" I promised.\n\n\"Thank you very much, sir. A very nice gentleman he is, sir. And quite\na different class from them two detectives from London, what goes\nprying about, and asking questions. I don't hold with foreigners as a\nrule, but from what the newspapers say I make out as how these brave\nBelges isn't the ordinary run of foreigners, and certainly he's a most\npolite spoken gentleman.\"\n\nDear old Dorcas! As she stood there, with her honest face upturned to\nmine, I thought what a fine specimen she was of the old-fashioned\nservant that is so fast dying out.\n\nI thought I might as well go down to the village at once, and look up\nPoirot; but I met him half-way, coming up to the house, and at once\ngave him Dorcas's message.\n\n\"Ah, the brave Dorcas! We will look at the chest, although--but no\nmatter--we will examine it all the same.\"\n\nWe entered the house by one of the windows. There was no one in the\nhall, and we went straight up to the attic.\n\nSure enough, there was the chest, a fine old piece, all studded with\nbrass nails, and full to overflowing with every imaginable type of\ngarment.\n\nPoirot bundled everything out on the floor with scant ceremony. There\nwere one or two green fabrics of varying shades; but Poirot shook his\nhead over them all. He seemed somewhat apathetic in the search, as\nthough he expected no great results from it. Suddenly he gave an\nexclamation.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Look!\"\n\nThe chest was nearly empty, and there, reposing right at the bottom,\nwas a magnificent black beard.\n\n\"_Oho!_\" said Poirot. \"_Oho!_\" He turned it over in his hands,\nexamining it closely. \"New,\" he remarked. \"Yes, quite new.\"\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation, he replaced it in the chest, heaped all\nthe other things on top of it as before, and made his way briskly\ndownstairs. He went straight to the pantry, where we found Dorcas\nbusily polishing her silver.\n\nPoirot wished her good morning with Gallic politeness, and went on:\n\n\"We have been looking through that chest, Dorcas.", "I am much obliged to\nyou for mentioning it. There is, indeed, a fine collection there. Are\nthey often used, may I ask?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, not very often nowadays, though from time to time we do\nhave what the young gentlemen call 'a dress-up night.' And very funny\nit is sometimes, sir. Mr. Lawrence, he's wonderful. Most comic! I shall\nnever forget the night he came down as the Char of Persia, I think he\ncalled it--a sort of Eastern King it was. He had the big paper knife in\nhis hand, and 'Mind, Dorcas,' he says, 'you'll have to be very\nrespectful. This is my specially sharpened scimitar, and it's off with\nyour head if I'm at all displeased with you!' Miss Cynthia, she was\nwhat they call an Apache, or some such name--a Frenchified sort of\ncut-throat, I take it to be. A real sight she looked. You'd never have\nbelieved a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into\nsuch a ruffian. Nobody would have known her.\"\n\n\"These evenings must have been great fun,\" said Poirot genially. \"I\nsuppose Mr. Lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs,\nwhen he was Shah of Persia?\"\n\n\"He did have a beard, sir,\" replied Dorcas, smiling. \"And well I know\nit, for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with! And\nI'm sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance. I didn't know as\nthere was a beard up there at all. It must have been got quite lately,\nI think. There was a red wig, I know, but nothing else in the way of\nhair. Burnt corks they use mostly--though 'tis messy getting it off\nagain. Miss Cynthia was a nigger once, and, oh, the trouble she had.\"\n\n\"So Dorcas knows nothing about that black beard,\" said Poirot\nthoughtfully, as we walked out into the hall again.\n\n\"Do you think it is _the_ one?\" I whispered eagerly.\n\nPoirot nodded.\n\n\"I do. You notice it had been trimmed?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Yes. It was cut exactly the shape of Mr.", "Inglethorp's, and I found one\nor two snipped hairs. Hastings, this affair is very deep.\"\n\n\"Who put it in the chest, I wonder?\"\n\n\"Someone with a good deal of intelligence,\" remarked Poirot dryly. \"You\nrealize that he chose the one place in the house to hide it where its\npresence would not be remarked? Yes, he is intelligent. But we must be\nmore intelligent. We must be so intelligent that he does not suspect us\nof being intelligent at all.\"\n\nI acquiesced.\n\n\"There, _mon ami_, you will be of great assistance to me.\"\n\nI was pleased with the compliment. There had been times when I hardly\nthought that Poirot appreciated me at my true worth.\n\n\"Yes,\" he continued, staring at me thoughtfully, \"you will be\ninvaluable.\"\n\nThis was naturally gratifying, but Poirot's next words were not so\nwelcome.\n\n\"I must have an ally in the house,\" he observed reflectively.\n\n\"You have me,\" I protested.\n\n\"True, but you are not sufficient.\"\n\nI was hurt, and showed it. Poirot hurried to explain himself.\n\n\"You do not quite take my meaning. You are known to be working with me.\nI want somebody who is not associated with us in any way.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see. How about John?\"\n\n\"No, I think not.\"\n\n\"The dear fellow isn't perhaps very bright,\" I said thoughtfully.\n\n\"Here comes Miss Howard,\" said Poirot suddenly. \"She is the very\nperson. But I am in her black books, since I cleared Mr. Inglethorp.\nStill, we can but try.\"\n\nWith a nod that was barely civil, Miss Howard assented to Poirot's\nrequest for a few minutes' conversation.\n\nWe went into the little morning-room, and Poirot closed the door.\n\n\"Well, Monsieur Poirot,\" said Miss Howard impatiently, \"what is it? Out\nwith it. I'm busy.\"\n\n\"Do you remember, mademoiselle, that I once asked you to help me?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.\" The lady nodded. \"And I told you I'd help you with\npleasure--to hang Alfred Inglethorp.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Poirot studied her seriously. \"Miss Howard, I will ask you one\nquestion. I beg of you to reply to it truthfully.\"\n\n\"Never tell lies,\" replied Miss Howard.", "\"It is this. Do you still believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by\nher husband?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked sharply. \"You needn't think your pretty\nexplanations influence me in the slightest. I'll admit that it wasn't\nhe who bought strychnine at the chemist's shop. What of that? I dare\nsay he soaked fly paper, as I told you at the beginning.\"\n\n\"That is arsenic--not strychnine,\" said Poirot mildly.\n\n\"What does that matter? Arsenic would put poor Emily out of the way\njust as well as strychnine. If I'm convinced he did it, it doesn't\nmatter a jot to me _how_ he did it.\"\n\n\"Exactly. _If_ you are convinced he did it,\" said Poirot quietly. \"I\nwill put my question in another form. Did you ever in your heart of\nhearts believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by her husband?\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Miss Howard. \"Haven't I always told you the man\nis a villain? Haven't I always told you he would murder her in her bed?\nHaven't I always hated him like poison?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Poirot. \"That bears out my little idea entirely.\"\n\n\"What little idea?\"\n\n\"Miss Howard, do you remember a conversation that took place on the day\nof my friend's arrival here? He repeated it to me, and there is a\nsentence of yours that has impressed me very much. Do you remember\naffirming that if a crime had been committed, and anyone you loved had\nbeen murdered, you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the\ncriminal was, even if you were quite unable to prove it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember saying that. I believe it too. I suppose you think it\nnonsense?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"And yet you will pay no attention to my instinct against Alfred\nInglethorp.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Poirot curtly. \"Because your instinct is not against Mr.\nInglethorp.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"No. You wish to believe he committed the crime. You believe him\ncapable of committing it. But your instinct tells you he did not commit\nit. It tells you more--shall I go on?\"\n\nShe was staring at him, fascinated, and made a slight affirmative\nmovement of the hand.", "\"Shall I tell you why you have been so vehement against Mr. Inglethorp?\nIt is because you have been trying to believe what you wish to believe.\nIt is because you are trying to drown and stifle your instinct, which\ntells you another name----\"\n\n\"No, no, no!\" cried Miss Howard wildly, flinging up her hands. \"Don't\nsay it! Oh, don't say it! It isn't true! It can't be true. I don't know\nwhat put such a wild--such a dreadful--idea into my head!\"\n\n\"I am right, am I not?\" asked Poirot.\n\n\"Yes, yes; you must be a wizard to have guessed. But it can't be\nso--it's too monstrous, too impossible. It _must_ be Alfred Inglethorp.\"\n\nPoirot shook his head gravely.\n\n\"Don't ask me about it,\" continued Miss Howard, \"because I shan't tell\nyou. I won't admit it, even to myself. I must be mad to think of such a\nthing.\"\n\nPoirot nodded, as if satisfied.\n\n\"I will ask you nothing. It is enough for me that it is as I thought.\nAnd I--I, too, have an instinct. We are working together towards a\ncommon end.\"\n\n\"Don't ask me to help you, because I won't. I wouldn't lift a finger\nto--to----\" She faltered.\n\n\"You will help me in spite of yourself. I ask you nothing--but you will\nbe my ally. You will not be able to help yourself. You will do the only\nthing that I want of you.\"\n\n\"And that is?\"\n\n\"You will watch!\"\n\nEvelyn Howard bowed her head.\n\n\"Yes, I can't help doing that. I am always watching--always hoping I\nshall be proved wrong.\"\n\n\"If we are wrong, well and good,\" said Poirot. \"No one will be more\npleased than I shall. But, if we are right? If we are right, Miss\nHoward, on whose side are you then?\"\n\n\"I don't know, I don't know----\"\n\n\"Come now.\"\n\n\"It could be hushed up.\"\n\n\"There must be no hushing up.\"\n\n\"But Emily herself----\" She broke off.\n\n\"Miss Howard,\" said Poirot gravely, \"this is unworthy of you.\"\n\nSuddenly she took her face from her hands.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said quietly, \"that was not Evelyn Howard who spoke!\"", "She\nflung her head up proudly. \"_This_ is Evelyn Howard! And she is on the\nside of Justice! Let the cost be what it may.\" And with these words,\nshe walked firmly out of the room.\n\n\"There,\" said Poirot, looking after her, \"goes a very valuable ally.\nThat woman, Hastings, has got brains as well as a heart.\"\n\nI did not reply.\n\n\"Instinct is a marvellous thing,\" mused Poirot. \"It can neither be\nexplained nor ignored.\"\n\n\"You and Miss Howard seem to know what you are talking about,\" I\nobserved coldly. \"Perhaps you don't realize that _I_ am still in the\ndark.\"\n\n\"Really? Is that so, _mon ami?_\"\n\n\"Yes. Enlighten me, will you?\"\n\nPoirot studied me attentively for a moment or two. Then, to my intense\nsurprise, he shook his head decidedly.\n\n\"No, my friend.\"\n\n\"Oh, look here, why not?\"\n\n\"Two is enough for a secret.\"\n\n\"Well, I think it is very unfair to keep back facts from me.\"\n\n\"I am not keeping back facts. Every fact that I know is in your\npossession. You can draw your own deductions from them. This time it is\na question of ideas.\"\n\n\"Still, it would be interesting to know.\"\n\nPoirot looked at me very earnestly, and again shook his head.\n\n\"You see,\" he said sadly, \"_you_ have no instincts.\"\n\n\"It was intelligence you were requiring just now,\" I pointed out.\n\n\"The two often go together,\" said Poirot enigmatically.\n\nThe remark seemed so utterly irrelevant that I did not even take the\ntrouble to answer it. But I decided that if I made any interesting and\nimportant discoveries--as no doubt I should--I would keep them to myself,\nand surprise Poirot with the ultimate result.\n\nThere are times when it is one's duty to assert oneself.\n\nI had had no opportunity as yet of passing on Poirot's message to\nLawrence. But now, as I strolled out on the lawn, still nursing a\ngrudge against my friend's high-handedness, I saw Lawrence on the\ncroquet lawn, aimlessly knocking a couple of very ancient balls about,\nwith a still more ancient mallet.\n\nIt struck me that it would be a good opportunity to deliver my message.", "Otherwise, Poirot himself might relieve me of it. It was true that I\ndid not quite gather its purport, but I flattered myself that by\nLawrence's reply, and perhaps a little skillful cross-examination on my\npart, I should soon perceive its significance. Accordingly I accosted\nhim.\n\n\"I've been looking for you,\" I remarked untruthfully.\n\n\"Have you?\"\n\n\"Yes. The truth is, I've got a message for you--from Poirot.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"He told me to wait until I was alone with you,\" I said, dropping my\nvoice significantly, and watching him intently out of the corner of my\neye. I have always been rather good at what is called, I believe,\ncreating an atmosphere.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nThere was no change of expression in the dark melancholic face. Had he\nany idea of what I was about to say?\n\n\"This is the message.\" I dropped my voice still lower. \"'Find the extra\ncoffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.'\"\n\n\"What on earth does he mean?\" Lawrence stared at me in quite unaffected\nastonishment.\n\n\"Don't you know?\"\n\n\"Not in the least. Do you?\"\n\nI was compelled to shake my head.\n\n\"What extra coffee-cup?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"He'd better ask Dorcas, or one of the maids, if he wants to know about\ncoffee-cups. It's their business, not mine. I don't know anything about\nthe coffee-cups, except that we've got some that are never used, which\nare a perfect dream! Old Worcester. You're not a connoisseur, are you,\nHastings?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"You miss a lot. A really perfect bit of old china--it's pure delight to\nhandle it, or even to look at it.\"\n\n\"Well, what am I to tell Poirot?\"\n\n\"Tell him I don't know what he's talking about. It's double Dutch to\nme.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nI was moving off towards the house again when he suddenly called me\nback.\n\n\"I say, what was the end of that message? Say it over again, will you?\"\n\n\"'Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.' Are you sure\nyou don't know what it means?\" I asked him earnestly.", "He shook his head.\n\n\"No,\" he said musingly, \"I don't. I--I wish I did.\"\n\nThe boom of the gong sounded from the house, and we went in together.\nPoirot had been asked by John to remain to lunch, and was already\nseated at the table.\n\nBy tacit consent, all mention of the tragedy was barred. We conversed\non the war, and other outside topics. But after the cheese and biscuits\nhad been handed round, and Dorcas had left the room, Poirot suddenly\nleant forward to Mrs. Cavendish.\n\n\"Pardon me, madame, for recalling unpleasant memories, but I have a\nlittle idea\"--Poirot's \"little ideas\" were becoming a perfect\nbyword--\"and would like to ask one or two questions.\"\n\n\"Of me? Certainly.\"\n\n\"You are too amiable, madame. What I want to ask is this: the door\nleading into Mrs. Inglethorp's room from that of Mademoiselle Cynthia,\nit was bolted, you say?\"\n\n\"Certainly it was bolted,\" replied Mary Cavendish, rather surprised. \"I\nsaid so at the inquest.\"\n\n\"Bolted?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" She looked perplexed.\n\n\"I mean,\" explained Poirot, \"you are sure it was bolted, and not merely\nlocked?\"\n\n\"Oh, I see what you mean. No, I don't know. I said bolted, meaning that\nit was fastened, and I could not open it, but I believe all the doors\nwere found bolted on the inside.\"\n\n\"Still, as far as you are concerned, the door might equally well have\nbeen locked?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"You yourself did not happen to notice, madame, when you entered Mrs.\nInglethorp's room, whether that door was bolted or not?\"\n\n\"I--I believe it was.\"\n\n\"But you did not see it?\"\n\n\"No. I--never looked.\"\n\n\"But _I_ did,\" interrupted Lawrence suddenly. \"I happened to notice\nthat it _was_ bolted.\"\n\n\"Ah, that settles it.\" And Poirot looked crestfallen.\n\nI could not help rejoicing that, for once, one of his \"little ideas\"\nhad come to naught.\n\nAfter lunch Poirot begged me to accompany him home. I consented rather\nstiffly.\n\n\"You are annoyed, is it not so?\" he asked anxiously, as we walked\nthrough the park.\n\n\"Not at all,\" I said coldly.\n\n\"That is well.", "That lifts a great load from my mind.\"\n\nThis was not quite what I had intended. I had hoped that he would have\nobserved the stiffness of my manner. Still, the fervour of his words\nwent towards the appeasing of my just displeasure. I thawed.\n\n\"I gave Lawrence your message,\" I said.\n\n\"And what did he say? He was entirely puzzled?\"\n\n\"Yes. I am quite sure he had no idea of what you meant.\"\n\nI had expected Poirot to be disappointed; but, to my surprise, he\nreplied that that was as he had thought, and that he was very glad. My\npride forbade me to ask any questions.\n\nPoirot switched off on another tack.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Cynthia was not at lunch to-day? How was that?\"\n\n\"She is at the hospital again. She resumed work to-day.\"\n\n\"Ah, she is an industrious little demoiselle. And pretty too. She is\nlike pictures I have seen in Italy. I would rather like to see that\ndispensary of hers. Do you think she would show it to me?\"\n\n\"I am sure she would be delighted. It's an interesting little place.\"\n\n\"Does she go there every day?\"\n\n\"She has all Wednesdays off, and comes back to lunch on Saturdays.\nThose are her only times off.\"\n\n\"I will remember. Women are doing great work nowadays, and Mademoiselle\nCynthia is clever--oh, yes, she has brains, that little one.\"\n\n\"Yes. I believe she has passed quite a stiff exam.\"\n\n\"Without doubt. After all, it is very responsible work. I suppose they\nhave very strong poisons there?\"\n\n\"Yes, she showed them to us. They are kept locked up in a little\ncupboard. I believe they have to be very careful. They always take out\nthe key before leaving the room.\"\n\n\"Indeed. It is near the window, this cupboard?\"\n\n\"No, right the other side of the room. Why?\"\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I wondered. That is all. Will you come in?\"\n\nWe had reached the cottage.\n\n\"No. I think I'll be getting back. I shall go round the long way\nthrough the woods.\"\n\nThe woods round Styles were very beautiful.", "After the walk across the\nopen park, it was pleasant to saunter lazily through the cool glades.\nThere was hardly a breath of wind, the very chirp of the birds was\nfaint and subdued. I strolled on a little way, and finally flung myself\ndown at the foot of a grand old beech-tree. My thoughts of mankind were\nkindly and charitable. I even forgave Poirot for his absurd secrecy. In\nfact, I was at peace with the world. Then I yawned.\n\nI thought about the crime, and it struck me as being very unreal and\nfar off.\n\nI yawned again.\n\nProbably, I thought, it really never happened. Of course, it was all a\nbad dream. The truth of the matter was that it was Lawrence who had\nmurdered Alfred Inglethorp with a croquet mallet. But it was absurd of\nJohn to make such a fuss about it, and to go shouting out: \"I tell you\nI won't have it!\"\n\nI woke up with a start.\n\nAt once I realized that I was in a very awkward predicament. For, about\ntwelve feet away from me, John and Mary Cavendish were standing facing\neach other, and they were evidently quarrelling. And, quite as\nevidently, they were unaware of my vicinity, for before I could move or\nspeak John repeated the words which had aroused me from my dream.\n\n\"I tell you, Mary, I won't have it.\"\n\nMary's voice came, cool and liquid:\n\n\"Have _you_ any right to criticize my actions?\"\n\n\"It will be the talk of the village! My mother was only buried on\nSaturday, and here you are gadding about with the fellow.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she shrugged her shoulders, \"if it is only village gossip that\nyou mind!\"\n\n\"But it isn't. I've had enough of the fellow hanging about. He's a\nPolish Jew, anyway.\"\n\n\"A tinge of Jewish blood is not a bad thing. It leavens the\"--she looked\nat him--\"stolid stupidity of the ordinary Englishman.\"\n\nFire in her eyes, ice in her voice. I did not wonder that the blood\nrose to John's face in a crimson tide.\n\n\"Mary!\"", "\"Well?\" Her tone did not change.\n\nThe pleading died out of his voice.\n\n\"Am I to understand that you will continue to see Bauerstein against my\nexpress wishes?\"\n\n\"If I choose.\"\n\n\"You defy me?\"\n\n\"No, but I deny your right to criticize my actions. Have _you_ no\nfriends of whom I should disapprove?\"\n\nJohn fell back a pace. The colour ebbed slowly from his face.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he said, in an unsteady voice.\n\n\"You see!\" said Mary quietly. \"You _do_ see, don't you, that _you_ have\nno right to dictate to _me_ as to the choice of my friends?\"\n\nJohn glanced at her pleadingly, a stricken look on his face.\n\n\"No right? Have I _no_ right, Mary?\" he said unsteadily. He stretched\nout his hands. \"Mary----\"\n\nFor a moment, I thought she wavered. A softer expression came over her\nface, then suddenly she turned almost fiercely away.\n\n\"None!\"\n\nShe was walking away when John sprang after her, and caught her by the\narm.\n\n\"Mary\"--his voice was very quiet now--\"are you in love with this fellow\nBauerstein?\"\n\nShe hesitated, and suddenly there swept across her face a strange\nexpression, old as the hills, yet with something eternally young about\nit. So might some Egyptian sphinx have smiled.\n\nShe freed herself quietly from his arm, and spoke over her shoulder.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" she said; and then swiftly passed out of the little glade,\nleaving John standing there as though he had been turned to stone.\n\nRather ostentatiously, I stepped forward, crackling some dead branches\nwith my feet as I did so. John turned. Luckily, he took it for granted\nthat I had only just come upon the scene.\n\n\"Hullo, Hastings. Have you seen the little fellow safely back to his\ncottage? Quaint little chap! Is he any good, though, really?\"\n\n\"He was considered one of the finest detectives of his day.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, I suppose there must be something in it, then. What a rotten\nworld it is, though!\"\n\n\"You find it so?\" I asked.\n\n\"Good Lord, yes! There's this terrible business to start with. Scotland\nYard men in and out of the house like a jack-in-the-box!", "Never know\nwhere they won't turn up next. Screaming headlines in every paper in\nthe country--damn all journalists, I say! Do you know there was a whole\ncrowd staring in at the lodge gates this morning. Sort of Madame\nTussaud's chamber of horrors business that can be seen for nothing.\nPretty thick, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Cheer up, John!\" I said soothingly. \"It can't last for ever.\"\n\n\"Can't it, though? It can last long enough for us never to be able to\nhold up our heads again.\"\n\n\"No, no, you're getting morbid on the subject.\"\n\n\"Enough to make a man morbid, to be stalked by beastly journalists and\nstared at by gaping moon-faced idiots, wherever he goes! But there's\nworse than that.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nJohn lowered his voice:\n\n\"Have you ever thought, Hastings--it's a nightmare to me--who did it? I\ncan't help feeling sometimes it must have been an accident.\nBecause--because--who could have done it? Now Inglethorp's out of the\nway, there's no one else; no one, I mean, except--one of us.\"\n\nYes, indeed, that was nightmare enough for any man! One of us? Yes,\nsurely it must be so, unless-----\n\nA new idea suggested itself to my mind. Rapidly, I considered it. The\nlight increased. Poirot's mysterious doings, his hints--they all fitted\nin. Fool that I was not to have thought of this possibility before, and\nwhat a relief for us all.\n\n\"No, John,\" I said, \"it isn't one of us. How could it be?\"\n\n\"I know, but, still, who else is there?\"\n\n\"Can't you guess?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nI looked cautiously round, and lowered my voice.\n\n\"Dr. Bauerstein!\" I whispered.\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"But what earthly interest could he have in my mother's death?\"\n\n\"That I don't see,\" I confessed, \"but I'll tell you this: Poirot thinks\nso.\"\n\n\"Poirot? Does he? How do you know?\"\n\nI told him of Poirot's intense excitement on hearing that Dr.\nBauerstein had been at Styles on the fatal night, and added:\n\n\"He said twice: 'That alters everything.' And I've been thinking. You\nknow Inglethorp said he had put down the coffee in the hall?", "Well, it\nwas just then that Bauerstein arrived. Isn't it possible that, as\nInglethorp brought him through the hall, the doctor dropped something\ninto the coffee in passing?\"\n\n\"H'm,\" said John. \"It would have been very risky.\"\n\n\"Yes, but it was possible.\"\n\n\"And then, how could he know it was her coffee? No, old fellow, I don't\nthink that will wash.\"\n\nBut I had remembered something else.\n\n\"You're quite right. That wasn't how it was done. Listen.\" And I then\ntold him of the cocoa sample which Poirot had taken to be analysed.\n\nJohn interrupted just as I had done.\n\n\"But, look here, Bauerstein had had it analysed already?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, that's the point. I didn't see it either until now. Don't\nyou understand? Bauerstein had it analysed--that's just it! If\nBauerstein's the murderer, nothing could be simpler than for him to\nsubstitute some ordinary cocoa for his sample, and send that to be\ntested. And of course they would find no strychnine! But no one would\ndream of suspecting Bauerstein, or think of taking another\nsample--except Poirot,\" I added, with belated recognition.\n\n\"Yes, but what about the bitter taste that cocoa won't disguise?\"\n\n\"Well, we've only his word for that. And there are other possibilities.\nHe's admittedly one of the world's greatest toxicologists----\"\n\n\"One of the world's greatest what? Say it again.\"\n\n\"He knows more about poisons than almost anybody,\" I explained. \"Well,\nmy idea is, that perhaps he's found some way of making strychnine\ntasteless. Or it may not have been strychnine at all, but some obscure\ndrug no one has ever heard of, which produces much the same symptoms.\"\n\n\"H'm, yes, that might be,\" said John. \"But look here, how could he have\ngot at the cocoa? That wasn't downstairs?\"\n\n\"No, it wasn't,\" I admitted reluctantly.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, a dreadful possibility flashed through my mind. I\nhoped and prayed it would not occur to John also. I glanced sideways at\nhim. He was frowning perplexedly, and I drew a deep breath of relief,\nfor the terrible thought that had flashed across my mind was this: that\nDr.", "Bauerstein might have had an accomplice.\n\nYet surely it could not be! Surely no woman as beautiful as Mary\nCavendish could be a murderess. Yet beautiful women had been known to\npoison.\n\nAnd suddenly I remembered that first conversation at tea on the day of\nmy arrival, and the gleam in her eyes as she had said that poison was a\nwoman's weapon. How agitated she had been on that fatal Tuesday\nevening! Had Mrs. Inglethorp discovered something between her and\nBauerstein, and threatened to tell her husband? Was it to stop that\ndenunciation that the crime had been committed?\n\nThen I remembered that enigmatical conversation between Poirot and\nEvelyn Howard. Was this what they had meant? Was this the monstrous\npossibility that Evelyn had tried not to believe?\n\nYes, it all fitted in.\n\nNo wonder Miss Howard had suggested \"hushing it up.\" Now I understood\nthat unfinished sentence of hers: \"Emily herself----\" And in my heart I\nagreed with her. Would not Mrs. Inglethorp have preferred to go\nunavenged rather than have such terrible dishonour fall upon the name\nof Cavendish.\n\n\"There's another thing,\" said John suddenly, and the unexpected sound\nof his voice made me start guiltily. \"Something which makes me doubt if\nwhat you say can be true.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" I asked, thankful that he had gone away from the subject\nof how the poison could have been introduced into the cocoa.\n\n\"Why, the fact that Bauerstein demanded a post-mortem. He needn't have\ndone so. Little Wilkins would have been quite content to let it go at\nheart disease.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said doubtfully. \"But we don't know. Perhaps he thought it\nsafer in the long run. Someone might have talked afterwards. Then the\nHome Office might have ordered exhumation. The whole thing would have\ncome out, then, and he would have been in an awkward position, for no\none would have believed that a man of his reputation could have been\ndeceived into calling it heart disease.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's possible,\" admitted John. \"Still,\" he added, \"I'm blest if\nI can see what his motive could have been.\"", "I trembled.\n\n\"Look here,\" I said, \"I may be altogether wrong. And, remember, all\nthis is in confidence.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course--that goes without saying.\"\n\nWe had walked, as we talked, and now we passed through the little gate\ninto the garden. Voices rose near at hand, for tea was spread out under\nthe sycamore-tree, as it had been on the day of my arrival.\n\nCynthia was back from the hospital, and I placed my chair beside her,\nand told her of Poirot's wish to visit the dispensary.\n\n\"Of course! I'd love him to see it. He'd better come to tea there one\nday. I must fix it up with him. He's such a dear little man! But he\n_is_ funny. He made me take the brooch out of my tie the other day, and\nput it in again, because he said it wasn't straight.\"\n\nI laughed.\n\n\"It's quite a mania with him.\"\n\n\"Yes, isn't it?\"\n\nWe were silent for a minute or two, and then, glancing in the direction\nof Mary Cavendish, and dropping her voice, Cynthia said:\n\n\"Mr. Hastings.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"After tea, I want to talk to you.\"\n\nHer glance at Mary had set me thinking. I fancied that between these\ntwo there existed very little sympathy. For the first time, it occurred\nto me to wonder about the girl's future. Mrs. Inglethorp had made no\nprovisions of any kind for her, but I imagined that John and Mary would\nprobably insist on her making her home with them--at any rate until the\nend of the war. John, I knew, was very fond of her, and would be sorry\nto let her go.\n\nJohn, who had gone into the house, now reappeared. His good-natured\nface wore an unaccustomed frown of anger.\n\n\"Confound those detectives! I can't think what they're after! They've\nbeen in every room in the house--turning things inside out, and upside\ndown. It really is too bad! I suppose they took advantage of our all\nbeing out. I shall go for that fellow Japp, when I next see him!\"\n\n\"Lot of Paul Prys,\" grunted Miss Howard.", "Lawrence opined that they had to make a show of doing something.\n\nMary Cavendish said nothing.\n\nAfter tea, I invited Cynthia to come for a walk, and we sauntered off\ninto the woods together.\n\n\"Well?\" I inquired, as soon as we were protected from prying eyes by\nthe leafy screen.\n\nWith a sigh, Cynthia flung herself down, and tossed off her hat. The\nsunlight, piercing through the branches, turned the auburn of her hair\nto quivering gold.\n\n\"Mr. Hastings--you are always so kind, and you know such a lot.\"\n\nIt struck me at this moment that Cynthia was really a very charming\ngirl! Much more charming than Mary, who never said things of that kind.\n\n\"Well?\" I asked benignantly, as she hesitated.\n\n\"I want to ask your advice. What shall I do?\"\n\n\"Do?\"\n\n\"Yes. You see, Aunt Emily always told me I should be provided for. I\nsuppose she forgot, or didn't think she was likely to die--anyway, I am\n_not_ provided for! And I don't know what to do. Do you think I ought\nto go away from here at once?\"\n\n\"Good heavens, no! They don't want to part with you, I'm sure.\"\n\nCynthia hesitated a moment, plucking up the grass with her tiny hands.\nThen she said: \"Mrs. Cavendish does. She hates me.\"\n\n\"Hates you?\" I cried, astonished.\n\nCynthia nodded.\n\n\"Yes. I don't know why, but she can't bear me; and _he_ can't, either.\"\n\n\"There I know you're wrong,\" I said warmly. \"On the contrary, John is\nvery fond of you.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--_John_. I meant Lawrence. Not, of course, that I care whether\nLawrence hates me or not. Still, it's rather horrid when no one loves\nyou, isn't it?\"\n\n\"But they do, Cynthia dear,\" I said earnestly. \"I'm sure you are\nmistaken. Look, there is John--and Miss Howard----\"\n\nCynthia nodded rather gloomily. \"Yes, John likes me, I think, and of\ncourse Evie, for all her gruff ways, wouldn't be unkind to a fly. But\nLawrence never speaks to me if he can help it, and Mary can hardly\nbring herself to be civil to me.", "She wants Evie to stay on, is begging\nher to, but she doesn't want me, and--and--I don't know what to do.\"\nSuddenly the poor child burst out crying.\n\nI don't know what possessed me. Her beauty, perhaps, as she sat there,\nwith the sunlight glinting down on her head; perhaps the sense of\nrelief at encountering someone who so obviously could have no\nconnection with the tragedy; perhaps honest pity for her youth and\nloneliness. Anyway, I leant forward, and taking her little hand, I said\nawkwardly:\n\n\"Marry me, Cynthia.\"\n\nUnwittingly, I had hit upon a sovereign remedy for her tears. She sat\nup at once, drew her hand away, and said, with some asperity:\n\n\"Don't be silly!\"\n\nI was a little annoyed.\n\n\"I'm not being silly. I am asking you to do me the honour of becoming\nmy wife.\"\n\nTo my intense surprise, Cynthia burst out laughing, and called me a\n\"funny dear.\"\n\n\"It's perfectly sweet of you,\" she said, \"but you know you don't want\nto!\"\n\n\"Yes, I do. I've got----\"\n\n\"Never mind what you've got. You don't really want to--and I don't\neither.\"\n\n\"Well, of course, that settles it,\" I said stiffly. \"But I don't see\nanything to laugh at. There's nothing funny about a proposal.\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said Cynthia. \"Somebody might accept you next time.\nGood-bye, you've cheered me up _very_ much.\"\n\nAnd, with a final uncontrollable burst of merriment, she vanished\nthrough the trees.\n\nThinking over the interview, it struck me as being profoundly\nunsatisfactory.\n\nIt occurred to me suddenly that I would go down to the village, and\nlook up Bauerstein. Somebody ought to be keeping an eye on the fellow.\nAt the same time, it would be wise to allay any suspicions he might\nhave as to his being suspected. I remembered how Poirot had relied on\nmy diplomacy. Accordingly, I went to the little house with the\n\"Apartments\" card inserted in the window, where I knew he lodged, and\ntapped on the door.\n\nAn old woman came and opened it.\n\n\"Good afternoon,\" I said pleasantly. \"Is Dr. Bauerstein in?\"", "She stared at me.\n\n\"Haven't you heard?\"\n\n\"Heard what?\"\n\n\"About him.\"\n\n\"What about him?\"\n\n\"He's took.\"\n\n\"Took? Dead?\"\n\n\"No, took by the perlice.\"\n\n\"By the police!\" I gasped. \"Do you mean they've arrested him?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's it, and----\"\n\nI waited to hear no more, but tore up the village to find Poirot.\n\nTo my extreme annoyance, Poirot was not in, and the old Belgian who\nanswered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to London.\n\nI was dumbfounded. What on earth could Poirot be doing in London! Was\nit a sudden decision on his part, or had he already made up his mind\nwhen he parted from me a few hours earlier?\n\nI retraced my steps to Styles in some annoyance. With Poirot away, I\nwas uncertain how to act. Had he foreseen this arrest? Had he not, in\nall probability, been the cause of it? Those questions I could not\nresolve. But in the meantime what was I to do? Should I announce the\narrest openly at Styles, or not? Though I did not acknowledge it to\nmyself, the thought of Mary Cavendish was weighing on me. Would it not\nbe a terrible shock to her? For the moment, I set aside utterly any\nsuspicions of her. She could not be implicated--otherwise I should have\nheard some hint of it.\n\nOf course, there was no possibility of being able permanently to\nconceal Dr. Bauerstein's arrest from her. It would be announced in\nevery newspaper on the morrow. Still, I shrank from blurting it out. If\nonly Poirot had been accessible, I could have asked his advice. What\npossessed him to go posting off to London in this unaccountable way?\n\nIn spite of myself, my opinion of his sagacity was immeasurably\nheightened. I would never have dreamt of suspecting the doctor, had not\nPoirot put it into my head. Yes, decidedly, the little man was clever.\n\nAfter some reflecting, I decided to take John into my confidence, and\nleave him to make the matter public or not, as he thought fit.\n\nHe gave vent to a prodigious whistle, as I imparted the news.", "\"Great Scott! You _were_ right, then. I couldn't believe it at the\ntime.\"\n\n\"No, it is astonishing until you get used to the idea, and see how it\nmakes everything fit in. Now, what are we to do? Of course, it will be\ngenerally known to-morrow.\"\n\nJohn reflected.\n\n\"Never mind,\" he said at last, \"we won't say anything at present. There\nis no need. As you say, it will be known soon enough.\"\n\nBut to my intense surprise, on getting down early the next morning, and\neagerly opening the newspapers, there was not a word about the arrest!\nThere was a column of mere padding about \"The Styles Poisoning Case,\"\nbut nothing further. It was rather inexplicable, but I supposed that,\nfor some reason or other, Japp wished to keep it out of the papers. It\nworried me just a little, for it suggested the possibility that there\nmight be further arrests to come.\n\nAfter breakfast, I decided to go down to the village, and see if Poirot\nhad returned yet; but, before I could start, a well-known face blocked\none of the windows, and the well-known voice said:\n\n\"_Bonjour, mon ami!_\"\n\n\"Poirot,\" I exclaimed, with relief, and seizing him by both hands, I\ndragged him into the room. \"I was never so glad to see anyone. Listen,\nI have said nothing to anybody but John. Is that right?\"\n\n\"My friend,\" replied Poirot, \"I do not know what you are talking\nabout.\"\n\n\"Dr. Bauerstein's arrest, of course,\" I answered impatiently.\n\n\"Is Bauerstein arrested, then?\"\n\n\"Did you not know it?\"\n\n\"Not the least in the world.\" But, pausing a moment, he added: \"Still,\nit does not surprise me. After all, we are only four miles from the\ncoast.\"\n\n\"The coast?\" I asked, puzzled. \"What has that got to do with it?\"\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Surely, it is obvious!\"\n\n\"Not to me. No doubt I am very dense, but I cannot see what the\nproximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of Mrs.\nInglethorp.\"\n\n\"Nothing at all, of course,\" replied Poirot, smiling. \"But we were\nspeaking of the arrest of Dr.", "Bauerstein.\"\n\n\"Well, he is arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp----\"\n\n\"What?\" cried Poirot, in apparently lively astonishment. \"Dr.\nBauerstein arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Impossible! That would be too good a farce! Who told you that, my\nfriend?\"\n\n\"Well, no one exactly told me,\" I confessed. \"But he is arrested.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, very likely. But for espionage, _mon ami_.\"\n\n\"Espionage?\" I gasped.\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"Not for poisoning Mrs. Inglethorp?\"\n\n\"Not unless our friend Japp has taken leave of his senses,\" replied\nPoirot placidly.\n\n\"But--but I thought you thought so too?\"\n\nPoirot gave me one look, which conveyed a wondering pity, and his full\nsense of the utter absurdity of such an idea.\n\n\"Do you mean to say,\" I asked, slowly adapting myself to the new idea,\n\"that Dr. Bauerstein is a spy?\"\n\nPoirot nodded.\n\n\"Have you never suspected it?\"\n\n\"It never entered my head.\"\n\n\"It did not strike you as peculiar that a famous London doctor should\nbury himself in a little village like this, and should be in the habit\nof walking about at all hours of the night, fully dressed?\"\n\n\"No,\" I confessed, \"I never thought of such a thing.\"\n\n\"He is, of course, a German by birth,\" said Poirot thoughtfully,\n\"though he has practised so long in this country that nobody thinks of\nhim as anything but an Englishman. He was naturalized about fifteen\nyears ago. A very clever man--a Jew, of course.\"\n\n\"The blackguard!\" I cried indignantly.\n\n\"Not at all. He is, on the contrary, a patriot. Think what he stands to\nlose. I admire the man myself.\"\n\nBut I could not look at it in Poirot's philosophical way.\n\n\"And this is the man with whom Mrs. Cavendish has been wandering about\nall over the country!\" I cried indignantly.\n\n\"Yes. I should fancy he had found her very useful,\" remarked Poirot.\n\"So long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together, any\nother vagaries of the doctor's passed unobserved.\"\n\n\"Then you think he never really cared for her?\" I asked eagerly--rather\ntoo eagerly, perhaps, under the circumstances.\n\n\"That, of course, I cannot say, but--shall I tell you my own private\nopinion, Hastings?\"", "\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, it is this: that Mrs. Cavendish does not care, and never has\ncared one little jot about Dr. Bauerstein!\"\n\n\"Do you really think so?\" I could not disguise my pleasure.\n\n\"I am quite sure of it. And I will tell you why.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Because she cares for someone else, _mon ami_.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" What did he mean? In spite of myself, an agreeable warmth spread\nover me. I am not a vain man where women are concerned, but I\nremembered certain evidences, too lightly thought of at the time,\nperhaps, but which certainly seemed to indicate----\n\nMy pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of Miss\nHoward. She glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in\nthe room, and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper. This she\nhanded to Poirot, murmuring as she did so the cryptic words:\n\n\"On top of the wardrobe.\" Then she hurriedly left the room.\n\nPoirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly, and uttered an exclamation\nof satisfaction. He spread it out on the table.\n\n\"Come here, Hastings. Now tell me, what is that initial--J. or L.?\"\n\nIt was a medium sized sheet of paper, rather dusty, as though it had\nlain by for some time. But it was the label that was attracting\nPoirot's attention. At the top, it bore the printed stamp of Messrs.\nParkson's, the well-known theatrical costumiers, and it was addressed\nto \"--(the debatable initial) Cavendish, Esq., Styles Court, Styles St.\nMary, Essex.\"\n\n\"It might be T., or it might be L.,\" I said, after studying the thing\nfor a minute or two. \"It certainly isn't a J.\"\n\n\"Good,\" replied Poirot, folding up the paper again. \"I, also, am of\nyour way of thinking. It is an L., depend upon it!\"\n\n\"Where did it come from?\" I asked curiously. \"Is it important?\"\n\n\"Moderately so. It confirms a surmise of mine. Having deduced its\nexistence, I set Miss Howard to search for it, and, as you see, she has\nbeen successful.\"\n\n\"What did she mean by 'On the top of the wardrobe'?\"\n\n\"She meant,\" replied Poirot promptly, \"that she found it on top of a\nwardrobe.\"", "\"A funny place for a piece of brown paper,\" I mused.\n\n\"Not at all. The top of a wardrobe is an excellent place for brown\npaper and cardboard boxes. I have kept them there myself. Neatly\narranged, there is nothing to offend the eye.\"\n\n\"Poirot,\" I asked earnestly, \"have you made up your mind about this\ncrime?\"\n\n\"Yes--that is to say, I believe I know how it was committed.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, I have no proof beyond my surmise, unless----\" With\nsudden energy, he caught me by the arm, and whirled me down the hall,\ncalling out in French in his excitement: \"Mademoiselle Dorcas,\nMademoiselle Dorcas, _un moment, s'il vous plait!_\"\n\nDorcas, quite flurried by the noise, came hurrying out of the pantry.\n\n\"My good Dorcas, I have an idea--a little idea--if it should prove\njustified, what magnificent chance! Tell me, on Monday, not Tuesday,\nDorcas, but Monday, the day before the tragedy, did anything go wrong\nwith Mrs. Inglethorp's bell?\"\n\nDorcas looked very surprised.\n\n\"Yes, sir, now you mention it, it did; though I don't know how you came\nto hear of it. A mouse, or some such, must have nibbled the wire\nthrough. The man came and put it right on Tuesday morning.\"\n\nWith a long drawn exclamation of ecstasy, Poirot led the way back to\nthe morning-room.\n\n\"See you, one should not ask for outside proof--no, reason should be\nenough. But the flesh is weak, it is consolation to find that one is on\nthe right track. Ah, my friend, I am like a giant refreshed. I run! I\nleap!\"\n\nAnd, in very truth, run and leap he did, gambolling wildly down the\nstretch of lawn outside the long window.\n\n\"What is your remarkable little friend doing?\" asked a voice behind me,\nand I turned to find Mary Cavendish at my elbow. She smiled, and so did\nI. \"What is it all about?\"\n\n\"Really, I can't tell you. He asked Dorcas some question about a bell,\nand appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering about as\nyou see!\"\n\nMary laughed.", "\"How ridiculous! He's going out of the gate. Isn't he coming back\nto-day?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I've given up trying to guess what he'll do next.\"\n\n\"Is he quite mad, Mr. Hastings?\"\n\n\"I honestly don't know. Sometimes, I feel sure he is as mad as a\nhatter; and then, just as he is at his maddest, I find there is method\nin his madness.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nIn spite of her laugh, Mary was looking thoughtful this morning. She\nseemed grave, almost sad.\n\nIt occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity to tackle her on\nthe subject of Cynthia. I began rather tactfully, _I_ thought, but I\nhad not gone far before she stopped me authoritatively.\n\n\"You are an excellent advocate, I have no doubt, Mr. Hastings, but in\nthis case your talents are quite thrown away. Cynthia will run no risk\nof encountering any unkindness from me.\"\n\nI began to stammer feebly that I hoped she hadn't thought---- But again\nshe stopped me, and her words were so unexpected that they quite drove\nCynthia, and her troubles, out of my mind.\n\n\"Mr. Hastings,\" she said, \"do you think I and my husband are happy\ntogether?\"\n\nI was considerably taken aback, and murmured something about it's not\nbeing my business to think anything of the sort.\n\n\"Well,\" she said quietly, \"whether it is your business or not, I will\ntell you that we are _not_ happy.\"\n\nI said nothing, for I saw that she had not finished.\n\nShe began slowly, walking up and down the room, her head a little bent,\nand that slim, supple figure of hers swaying gently as she walked. She\nstopped suddenly, and looked up at me.\n\n\"You don't know anything about me, do you?\" she asked. \"Where I come\nfrom, who I was before I married John--anything, in fact? Well, I will\ntell you. I will make a father confessor of you. You are kind, I\nthink--yes, I am sure you are kind.\"\n\nSomehow, I was not quite as elated as I might have been. I remembered\nthat Cynthia had begun her confidences in much the same way.", "Besides, a\nfather confessor should be elderly, it is not at all the role for a\nyoung man.\n\n\"My father was English,\" said Mrs. Cavendish, \"but my mother was a\nRussian.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" I said, \"now I understand----\"\n\n\"Understand what?\"\n\n\"A hint of something foreign--different--that there has always been about\nyou.\"\n\n\"My mother was very beautiful, I believe. I don't know, because I never\nsaw her. She died when I was quite a little child. I believe there was\nsome tragedy connected with her death--she took an overdose of some\nsleeping draught by mistake. However that may be, my father was\nbroken-hearted. Shortly afterwards, he went into the Consular Service.\nEverywhere he went, I went with him. When I was twenty-three, I had\nbeen nearly all over the world. It was a splendid life--I loved it.\"\n\nThere was a smile on her face, and her head was thrown back. She seemed\nliving in the memory of those old glad days.\n\n\"Then my father died. He left me very badly off. I had to go and live\nwith some old aunts in Yorkshire.\" She shuddered. \"You will understand\nme when I say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as I had\nbeen. The narrowness, the deadly monotony of it, almost drove me mad.\"\nShe paused a minute, and added in a different tone: \"And then I met\nJohn Cavendish.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"You can imagine that, from my aunts' point of view, it was a very good\nmatch for me. But I can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed\nwith me. No, he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable\nmonotony of my life.\"\n\nI said nothing, and after a moment, she went on:\n\n\"Don't misunderstand me. I was quite honest with him. I told him, what\nwas true, that I liked him very much, that I hoped to come to like him\nmore, but that I was not in any way what the world calls 'in love' with\nhim. He declared that that satisfied him, and so--we were married.\"", "She waited a long time, a little frown had gathered on her forehead.\nShe seemed to be looking back earnestly into those past days.\n\n\"I think--I am sure--he cared for me at first. But I suppose we were not\nwell matched. Almost at once, we drifted apart. He--it is not a pleasing\nthing for my pride, but it is the truth--tired of me very soon.\" I must\nhave made some murmur of dissent, for she went on quickly: \"Oh, yes, he\ndid! Not that it matters now--now that we've come to the parting of the\nways.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nShe answered quietly:\n\n\"I mean that I am not going to remain at Styles.\"\n\n\"You and John are not going to live here?\"\n\n\"John may live here, but I shall not.\"\n\n\"You are going to leave him?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\nShe paused a long time, and said at last:\n\n\"Perhaps--because I want to be--free!\"\n\nAnd, as she spoke, I had a sudden vision of broad spaces, virgin tracts\nof forests, untrodden lands--and a realization of what freedom would\nmean to such a nature as Mary Cavendish. I seemed to see her for a\nmoment as she was, a proud wild creature, as untamed by civilization as\nsome shy bird of the hills. A little cry broke from her lips:\n\n\"You don't know, you don't know, how this hateful place has been prison\nto me!\"\n\n\"I understand,\" I said, \"but--but don't do anything rash.\"\n\n\"Oh, rash!\" Her voice mocked at my prudence.\n\nThen suddenly I said a thing I could have bitten out my tongue for:\n\n\"You know that Dr. Bauerstein has been arrested?\"\n\nAn instant coldness passed like a mask over her face, blotting out all\nexpression.\n\n\"John was so kind as to break that to me this morning.\"\n\n\"Well, what do you think?\" I asked feebly.\n\n\"Of what?\"\n\n\"Of the arrest?\"\n\n\"What should I think? Apparently he is a German spy; so the gardener\nhad told John.\"\n\nHer face and voice were absolutely cold and expressionless. Did she\ncare, or did she not?", "She moved away a step or two, and fingered one of the flower vases.\n\n\"These are quite dead. I must do them again. Would you mind\nmoving--thank you, Mr. Hastings.\" And she walked quietly past me out of\nthe window, with a cool little nod of dismissal.\n\nNo, surely she could not care for Bauerstein. No woman could act her\npart with that icy unconcern.\n\nPoirot did not make his appearance the following morning, and there was\nno sign of the Scotland Yard men.\n\nBut, at lunch-time, there arrived a new piece of evidence--or rather\nlack of evidence. We had vainly tried to trace the fourth letter, which\nMrs. Inglethorp had written on the evening preceding her death. Our\nefforts having been in vain, we had abandoned the matter, hoping that\nit might turn up of itself one day. And this is just what did happen,\nin the shape of a communication, which arrived by the second post from\na firm of French music publishers, acknowledging Mrs. Inglethorp's\ncheque, and regretting they had been unable to trace a certain series\nof Russian folksongs. So the last hope of solving the mystery, by means\nof Mrs. Inglethorp's correspondence on the fatal evening, had to be\nabandoned.\n\nJust before tea, I strolled down to tell Poirot of the new\ndisappointment, but found, to my annoyance, that he was once more out.\n\n\"Gone to London again?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, monsieur, he has but taken the train to Tadminster. 'To see a\nyoung lady's dispensary,' he said.\"\n\n\"Silly ass!\" I ejaculated. \"I told him Wednesday was the one day she\nwasn't there! Well, tell him to look us up to-morrow morning, will\nyou?\"\n\n\"Certainly, monsieur.\"\n\nBut, on the following day, no sign of Poirot. I was getting angry. He\nwas really treating us in the most cavalier fashion.\n\nAfter lunch, Lawrence drew me aside, and asked if I was going down to\nsee him.\n\n\"No, I don't think I shall. He can come up here if he wants to see us.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Lawrence looked indeterminate. Something unusually nervous and\nexcited in his manner roused my curiosity.", "\"What is it?\" I asked. \"I could go if there's anything special.\"\n\n\"It's nothing much, but--well, if you are going, will you tell him----\" he\ndropped his voice to a whisper--\"I think I've found the extra\ncoffee-cup!\"\n\nI had almost forgotten that enigmatical message of Poirot's, but now my\ncuriosity was aroused afresh.\n\nLawrence would say no more, so I decided that I would descend from my\nhigh horse, and once more seek out Poirot at Leastways Cottage.\n\nThis time I was received with a smile. Monsieur Poirot was within.\nWould I mount? I mounted accordingly.\n\nPoirot was sitting by the table, his head buried in his hands. He\nsprang up at my entrance.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked solicitously. \"You are not ill, I trust?\"\n\n\"No, no, not ill. But I decide an affair of great moment.\"\n\n\"Whether to catch the criminal or not?\" I asked facetiously.\n\nBut, to my great surprise, Poirot nodded gravely.\n\n\"'To speak or not to speak,' as your so great Shakespeare says, 'that\nis the question.'\"\n\nI did not trouble to correct the quotation.\n\n\"You are not serious, Poirot?\"\n\n\"I am of the most serious. For the most serious of all things hangs in\nthe balance.\"\n\n\"And that is?\"\n\n\"A woman's happiness, _mon ami_,\" he said gravely.\n\nI did not quite know what to say.\n\n\"The moment has come,\" said Poirot thoughtfully, \"and I do not know\nwhat to do. For, see you, it is a big stake for which I play. No one\nbut I, Hercule Poirot, would attempt it!\" And he tapped himself proudly\non the breast.\n\nAfter pausing a few minutes respectfully, so as not to spoil his\neffect, I gave him Lawrence's message.\n\n\"Aha!\" he cried. \"So he has found the extra coffee-cup. That is good.\nHe has more intelligence than would appear, this long-faced Monsieur\nLawrence of yours!\"\n\nI did not myself think very highly of Lawrence's intelligence; but I\nforebore to contradict Poirot, and gently took him to task for\nforgetting my instructions as to which were Cynthia's days off.\n\n\"It is true.", "I have the head of a sieve. However, the other young lady\nwas most kind. She was sorry for my disappointment, and showed me\neverything in the kindest way.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, that's all right, then, and you must go to tea with Cynthia\nanother day.\"\n\nI told him about the letter.\n\n\"I am sorry for that,\" he said. \"I always had hopes of that letter. But\nno, it was not to be. This affair must all be unravelled from within.\"\nHe tapped his forehead. \"These little grey cells. It is 'up to them'--as\nyou say over here.\" Then, suddenly, he asked: \"Are you a judge of\nfinger-marks, my friend?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, rather surprised, \"I know that there are no two\nfinger-marks alike, but that's as far as my science goes.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nHe unlocked a little drawer, and took out some photographs which he\nlaid on the table.\n\n\"I have numbered them, 1, 2, 3. Will you describe them to me?\"\n\nI studied the proofs attentively.\n\n\"All greatly magnified, I see. No. 1, I should say, are a man's\nfinger-prints; thumb and first finger. No. 2 are a lady's; they are\nmuch smaller, and quite different in every way. No. 3\"--I paused for\nsome time--\"there seem to be a lot of confused finger-marks, but here,\nvery distinctly, are No. 1's.\"\n\n\"Overlapping the others?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You recognize them beyond fail?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; they are identical.\"\n\nPoirot nodded, and gently taking the photographs from me locked them up\nagain.\n\n\"I suppose,\" I said, \"that as usual, you are not going to explain?\"\n\n\"On the contrary. No. 1 were the finger-prints of Monsieur Lawrence.\nNo. 2 were those of Mademoiselle Cynthia. They are not important. I\nmerely obtained them for comparison. No. 3 is a little more\ncomplicated.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"It is, as you see, highly magnified. You may have noticed a sort of\nblur extending all across the picture. I will not describe to you the\nspecial apparatus, dusting powder, etc., which I used. It is a\nwell-known process to the police, and by means of it you can obtain a\nphotograph of the finger-prints of any object in a very short space of\ntime.", "Well, my friend, you have seen the finger-marks--it remains to\ntell you the particular object on which they had been left.\"\n\n\"Go on--I am really excited.\"\n\n\"_Eh bien!_ Photo No. 3 represents the highly magnified surface of a\ntiny bottle in the top poison cupboard of the dispensary in the Red\nCross Hospital at Tadminster--which sounds like the house that Jack\nbuilt!\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" I exclaimed. \"But what were Lawrence Cavendish's\nfinger-marks doing on it? He never went near the poison cupboard the\nday we were there!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, he did!\"\n\n\"Impossible! We were all together the whole time.\"\n\nPoirot shook his head.\n\n\"No, my friend, there was a moment when you were not all together.\nThere was a moment when you could not have been all together, or it\nwould not have been necessary to call to Monsieur Lawrence to come and\njoin you on the balcony.\"\n\n\"I'd forgotten that,\" I admitted. \"But it was only for a moment.\"\n\n\"Long enough.\"\n\n\"Long enough for what?\"\n\nPoirot's smile became rather enigmatical.\n\n\"Long enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a\nvery natural interest and curiosity.\"\n\nOur eyes met. Poirot's were pleasantly vague. He got up and hummed a\nlittle tune. I watched him suspiciously.\n\n\"Poirot,\" I said, \"what was in this particular little bottle?\"\n\nPoirot looked out of the window.\n\n\"Hydro-chloride of strychnine,\" he said, over his shoulder, continuing\nto hum.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" I said it quite quietly. I was not surprised. I had\nexpected that answer.\n\n\"They use the pure hydro-chloride of strychnine very little--only\noccasionally for pills. It is the official solution, Liq. Strychnine\nHydro-clor. that is used in most medicines. That is why the\nfinger-marks have remained undisturbed since then.\"\n\n\"How did you manage to take this photograph?\"\n\n\"I dropped my hat from the balcony,\" explained Poirot simply. \"Visitors\nwere not permitted below at that hour, so, in spite of my many\napologies, Mademoiselle Cynthia's colleague had to go down and fetch it\nfor me.\"\n\n\"Then you knew what you were going to find?\"", "\"No, not at all. I merely realized that it was possible, from your\nstory, for Monsieur Lawrence to go to the poison cupboard. The\npossibility had to be confirmed, or eliminated.\"\n\n\"Poirot,\" I said, \"your gaiety does not deceive me. This is a very\nimportant discovery.\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" said Poirot. \"But one thing does strike me. No doubt\nit has struck you too.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"Why, that there is altogether too much strychnine about this case.\nThis is the third time we run up against it. There was strychnine in\nMrs. Inglethorp's tonic. There is the strychnine sold across the\ncounter at Styles St. Mary by Mace. Now we have more strychnine,\nhandled by one of the household. It is confusing; and, as you know, I\ndo not like confusion.\"\n\nBefore I could reply, one of the other Belgians opened the door and\nstuck his head in.\n\n\"There is a lady below, asking for Mr Hastings.\"\n\n\"A lady?\"\n\nI jumped up. Poirot followed me down the narrow stairs. Mary Cavendish\nwas standing in the doorway.\n\n\"I have been visiting an old woman in the village,\" she explained, \"and\nas Lawrence told me you were with Monsieur Poirot I thought I would\ncall for you.\"\n\n\"Alas, madame,\" said Poirot, \"I thought you had come to honour me with\na visit!\"\n\n\"I will some day, if you ask me,\" she promised him, smiling.\n\n\"That is well. If you should need a father confessor, madame\"--she\nstarted ever so slightly--\"remember, Papa Poirot is always at your\nservice.\"\n\nShe stared at him for a few minutes, as though seeking to read some\ndeeper meaning into his words. Then she turned abruptly away.\n\n\"Come, will you not walk back with us too, Monsieur Poirot?\"\n\n\"Enchanted, madame.\"\n\nAll the way to Styles, Mary talked fast and feverishly. It struck me\nthat in some way she was nervous of Poirot's eyes.\n\nThe weather had broken, and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its\nshrewishness. Mary shivered a little, and buttoned her black sports\ncoat closer. The wind through the trees made a mournful noise, like\nsome great giant sighing.", "We walked up to the great door of Styles, and at once the knowledge\ncame to us that something was wrong.\n\nDorcas came running out to meet us. She was crying and wringing her\nhands. I was aware of other servants huddled together in the\nbackground, all eyes and ears.\n\n\"Oh, m'am! Oh, m'am! I don't know how to tell you----\"\n\n\"What is it, Dorcas?\" I asked impatiently. \"Tell us at once.\"\n\n\"It's those wicked detectives. They've arrested him--they've arrested\nMr. Cavendish!\"\n\n\"Arrested Lawrence?\" I gasped.\n\nI saw a strange look come into Dorcas's eyes.\n\n\"No, sir. Not Mr. Lawrence--Mr. John.\"\n\nBehind me, with a wild cry, Mary Cavendish fell heavily against me, and\nas I turned to catch her I met the quiet triumph in Poirot's eyes.\n\nThe trial of John Cavendish for the murder of his stepmother took place\ntwo months later.\n\nOf the intervening weeks I will say little, but my admiration and\nsympathy went out unfeignedly to Mary Cavendish. She ranged herself\npassionately on her husband's side, scorning the mere idea of his\nguilt, and fought for him tooth and nail.\n\nI expressed my admiration to Poirot, and he nodded thoughtfully.\n\n\"Yes, she is of those women who show at their best in adversity. It\nbrings out all that is sweetest and truest in them. Her pride and her\njealousy have----\"\n\n\"Jealousy?\" I queried.\n\n\"Yes. Have you not realized that she is an unusually jealous woman? As\nI was saying, her pride and jealousy have been laid aside. She thinks\nof nothing but her husband, and the terrible fate that is hanging over\nhim.\"\n\nHe spoke very feelingly, and I looked at him earnestly, remembering\nthat last afternoon, when he had been deliberating whether or not to\nspeak. With his tenderness for \"a woman's happiness,\" I felt glad that\nthe decision had been taken out of his hands.\n\n\"Even now,\" I said, \"I can hardly believe it. You see, up to the very\nlast minute, I thought it was Lawrence!\"\n\nPoirot grinned.\n\n\"I know you did.\"\n\n\"But John! My old friend John!\"\n\n\"Every murderer is probably somebody's old friend,\" observed Poirot\nphilosophically.", "\"You cannot mix up sentiment and reason.\"\n\n\"I must say I think you might have given me a hint.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, _mon ami_, I did not do so, just because he _was_ your old\nfriend.\"\n\nI was rather disconcerted by this, remembering how I had busily passed\non to John what I believed to be Poirot's views concerning Bauerstein.\nHe, by the way, had been acquitted of the charge brought against him.\nNevertheless, although he had been too clever for them this time, and\nthe charge of espionage could not be brought home to him, his wings\nwere pretty well clipped for the future.\n\nI asked Poirot whether he thought John would be condemned. To my\nintense surprise, he replied that, on the contrary, he was extremely\nlikely to be acquitted.\n\n\"But, Poirot----\" I protested.\n\n\"Oh, my friend, have I not said to you all along that I have no proofs.\nIt is one thing to know that a man is guilty, it is quite another\nmatter to prove him so. And, in this case, there is terribly little\nevidence. That is the whole trouble. I, Hercule Poirot, know, but I\nlack the last link in my chain. And unless I can find that missing\nlink----\" He shook his head gravely.\n\n\"When did you first suspect John Cavendish?\" I asked, after a minute or\ntwo.\n\n\"Did you not suspect him at all?\"\n\n\"No, indeed.\"\n\n\"Not after that fragment of conversation you overheard between Mrs.\nCavendish and her mother-in-law, and her subsequent lack of frankness\nat the inquest?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Did you not put two and two together, and reflect that if it was not\nAlfred Inglethorp who was quarrelling with his wife--and you remember,\nhe strenuously denied it at the inquest--it must be either Lawrence or\nJohn. Now, if it was Lawrence, Mary Cavendish's conduct was just as\ninexplicable. But if, on the other hand, it was John, the whole thing\nwas explained quite naturally.\"\n\n\"So,\" I cried, a light breaking in upon me, \"it was John who quarrelled\nwith his mother that afternoon?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"And you have known this all along?\"", "\"Certainly. Mrs. Cavendish's behaviour could only be explained that\nway.\"\n\n\"And yet you say he may be acquitted?\"\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Certainly I do. At the police court proceedings, we shall hear the\ncase for the prosecution, but in all probability his solicitors will\nadvise him to reserve his defence. That will be sprung upon us at the\ntrial. And--ah, by the way, I have a word of caution to give you, my\nfriend. I must not appear in the case.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"No. Officially, I have nothing to do with it. Until I have found that\nlast link in my chain, I must remain behind the scenes. Mrs. Cavendish\nmust think I am working for her husband, not against him.\"\n\n\"I say, that's playing it a bit low down,\" I protested.\n\n\"Not at all. We have to deal with a most clever and unscrupulous man,\nand we must use any means in our power--otherwise he will slip through\nour fingers. That is why I have been careful to remain in the\nbackground. All the discoveries have been made by Japp, and Japp will\ntake all the credit. If I am called upon to give evidence at all\"--he\nsmiled broadly--\"it will probably be as a witness for the defence.\"\n\nI could hardly believe my ears.\n\n\"It is quite _en regle_,\" continued Poirot. \"Strangely enough, I can\ngive evidence that will demolish one contention of the prosecution.\"\n\n\"Which one?\"\n\n\"The one that relates to the destruction of the will. John Cavendish\ndid not destroy that will.\"\n\nPoirot was a true prophet. I will not go into the details of the police\ncourt proceedings, as it involves many tiresome repetitions. I will\nmerely state baldly that John Cavendish reserved his defence, and was\nduly committed for trial.\n\nSeptember found us all in London. Mary took a house in Kensington,\nPoirot being included in the family party.\n\nI myself had been given a job at the War Office, so was able to see\nthem continually.\n\nAs the weeks went by, the state of Poirot's nerves grew worse and\nworse.", "That \"last link\" he talked about was still lacking. Privately, I\nhoped it might remain so, for what happiness could there be for Mary,\nif John were not acquitted?\n\nOn September 15th John Cavendish appeared in the dock at the Old\nBailey, charged with \"The Wilful Murder of Emily Agnes Inglethorp,\" and\npleaded \"Not Guilty.\"\n\nSir Ernest Heavywether, the famous K.C., had been engaged to defend\nhim.\n\nMr. Philips, K.C., opened the case for the Crown.\n\nThe murder, he said, was a most premeditated and cold-blooded one. It\nwas neither more nor less than the deliberate poisoning of a fond and\ntrusting woman by the stepson to whom she had been more than a mother.\nEver since his boyhood, she had supported him. He and his wife had\nlived at Styles Court in every luxury, surrounded by her care and\nattention. She had been their kind and generous benefactress.\n\nHe proposed to call witnesses to show how the prisoner, a profligate\nand spendthrift, had been at the end of his financial tether, and had\nalso been carrying on an intrigue with a certain Mrs. Raikes, a\nneighbouring farmer's wife. This having come to his stepmother's ears,\nshe taxed him with it on the afternoon before her death, and a quarrel\nensued, part of which was overheard. On the previous day, the prisoner\nhad purchased strychnine at the village chemist's shop, wearing a\ndisguise by means of which he hoped to throw the onus of the crime upon\nanother man--to wit, Mrs. Inglethorp's husband, of whom he had been\nbitterly jealous. Luckily for Mr. Inglethorp, he had been able to\nproduce an unimpeachable alibi.\n\nOn the afternoon of July 17th, continued Counsel, immediately after the\nquarrel with her son, Mrs. Inglethorp made a new will. This will was\nfound destroyed in the grate of her bedroom the following morning, but\nevidence had come to light which showed that it had been drawn up in\nfavour of her husband. Deceased had already made a will in his favour\nbefore her marriage, but--and Mr. Philips wagged an expressive\nforefinger--the prisoner was not aware of that.", "What had induced the\ndeceased to make a fresh will, with the old one still extant, he could\nnot say. She was an old lady, and might possibly have forgotten the\nformer one; or--this seemed to him more likely--she may have had an idea\nthat it was revoked by her marriage, as there had been some\nconversation on the subject. Ladies were not always very well versed in\nlegal knowledge. She had, about a year before, executed a will in\nfavour of the prisoner. He would call evidence to show that it was the\nprisoner who ultimately handed his stepmother her coffee on the fatal\nnight. Later in the evening, he had sought admission to her room, on\nwhich occasion, no doubt, he found an opportunity of destroying the\nwill which, as far as he knew, would render the one in his favour\nvalid.\n\nThe prisoner had been arrested in consequence of the discovery, in his\nroom, by Detective Inspector Japp--a most brilliant officer--of the\nidentical phial of strychnine which had been sold at the village\nchemist's to the supposed Mr. Inglethorp on the day before the murder.\nIt would be for the jury to decide whether or not these damning facts\nconstituted an overwhelming proof of the prisoner's guilt.\n\nAnd, subtly implying that a jury which did not so decide, was quite\nunthinkable, Mr. Philips sat down and wiped his forehead.\n\nThe first witnesses for the prosecution were mostly those who had been\ncalled at the inquest, the medical evidence being again taken first.\n\nSir Ernest Heavywether, who was famous all over England for the\nunscrupulous manner in which he bullied witnesses, only asked two\nquestions.\n\n\"I take it, Dr. Bauerstein, that strychnine, as a drug, acts quickly?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And that you are unable to account for the delay in this case?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nMr. Mace identified the phial handed him by Counsel as that sold by him\nto \"Mr. Inglethorp.\" Pressed, he admitted that he only knew Mr.\nInglethorp by sight. He had never spoken to him. The witness was not\ncross-examined.", "Alfred Inglethorp was called, and denied having purchased the poison.\nHe also denied having quarrelled with his wife. Various witnesses\ntestified to the accuracy of these statements.\n\nThe gardeners' evidence, as to the witnessing of the will was taken,\nand then Dorcas was called.\n\nDorcas, faithful to her \"young gentlemen,\" denied strenuously that it\ncould have been John's voice she heard, and resolutely declared, in the\nteeth of everything, that it was Mr. Inglethorp who had been in the\nboudoir with her mistress. A rather wistful smile passed across the\nface of the prisoner in the dock. He knew only too well how useless her\ngallant defiance was, since it was not the object of the defence to\ndeny this point. Mrs. Cavendish, of course, could not be called upon to\ngive evidence against her husband.\n\nAfter various questions on other matters, Mr. Philips asked:\n\n\"In the month of June last, do you remember a parcel arriving for Mr.\nLawrence Cavendish from Parkson's?\"\n\nDorcas shook her head.\n\n\"I don't remember, sir. It may have done, but Mr. Lawrence was away\nfrom home part of June.\"\n\n\"In the event of a parcel arriving for him whilst he was away, what\nwould be done with it?\"\n\n\"It would either be put in his room or sent on after him.\"\n\n\"By you?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I should leave it on the hall table. It would be Miss Howard\nwho would attend to anything like that.\"\n\nEvelyn Howard was called and, after being examined on other points, was\nquestioned as to the parcel.\n\n\"Don't remember. Lots of parcels come. Can't remember one special one.\"\n\n\"You do not know if it was sent after Mr. Lawrence Cavendish to Wales,\nor whether it was put in his room?\"\n\n\"Don't think it was sent after him. Should have remembered it if it\nwas.\"\n\n\"Supposing a parcel arrived addressed to Mr. Lawrence Cavendish, and\nafterwards it disappeared, should you remark its absence?\"\n\n\"No, don't think so. I should think someone had taken charge of it.\"\n\n\"I believe, Miss Howard, that it was you who found this sheet of brown\npaper?\"", "He held up the same dusty piece which Poirot and I had examined\nin the morning-room at Styles.\n\n\"Yes, I did.\"\n\n\"How did you come to look for it?\"\n\n\"The Belgian detective who was employed on the case asked me to search\nfor it.\"\n\n\"Where did you eventually discover it?\"\n\n\"On the top of--of--a wardrobe.\"\n\n\"On top of the prisoner's wardrobe?\"\n\n\"I--I believe so.\"\n\n\"Did you not find it yourself?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then you must know where you found it?\"\n\n\"Yes, it was on the prisoner's wardrobe.\"\n\n\"That is better.\"\n\nAn assistant from Parkson's, Theatrical Costumiers, testified that on\nJune 29th, they had supplied a black beard to Mr. L. Cavendish, as\nrequested. It was ordered by letter, and a postal order was enclosed.\nNo, they had not kept the letter. All transactions were entered in\ntheir books. They had sent the beard, as directed, to \"L. Cavendish,\nEsq., Styles Court.\"\n\nSir Ernest Heavywether rose ponderously.\n\n\"Where was the letter written from?\"\n\n\"From Styles Court.\"\n\n\"The same address to which you sent the parcel?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And the letter came from there?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nLike a beast of prey, Heavywether fell upon him:\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"I--I don't understand.\"\n\n\"How do you know that letter came from Styles? Did you notice the\npostmark?\"\n\n\"No--but----\"\n\n\"Ah, you did _not_ notice the postmark! And yet you affirm so\nconfidently that it came from Styles. It might, in fact, have been any\npostmark?\"\n\n\"Y--es.\"\n\n\"In fact, the letter, though written on stamped notepaper, might have\nbeen posted from anywhere? From Wales, for instance?\"\n\nThe witness admitted that such might be the case, and Sir Ernest\nsignified that he was satisfied.\n\nElizabeth Wells, second housemaid at Styles, stated that after she had\ngone to bed she remembered that she had bolted the front door, instead\nof leaving it on the latch as Mr. Inglethorp had requested. She had\naccordingly gone downstairs again to rectify her error. Hearing a\nslight noise in the West wing, she had peeped along the passage, and\nhad seen Mr. John Cavendish knocking at Mrs.", "Inglethorp's door.\n\nSir Ernest Heavywether made short work of her, and under his unmerciful\nbullying she contradicted herself hopelessly, and Sir Ernest sat down\nagain with a satisfied smile on his face.\n\nWith the evidence of Annie, as to the candle grease on the floor, and\nas to seeing the prisoner take the coffee into the boudoir, the\nproceedings were adjourned until the following day.\n\nAs we went home, Mary Cavendish spoke bitterly against the prosecuting\ncounsel.\n\n\"That hateful man! What a net he has drawn around my poor John! How he\ntwisted every little fact until he made it seem what it wasn't!\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said consolingly, \"it will be the other way about to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said meditatively; then suddenly dropped her voice. \"Mr.\nHastings, you do not think--surely it could not have been Lawrence--Oh,\nno, that could not be!\"\n\nBut I myself was puzzled, and as soon as I was alone with Poirot I\nasked him what he thought Sir Ernest was driving at.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Poirot appreciatively. \"He is a clever man, that Sir\nErnest.\"\n\n\"Do you think he believes Lawrence guilty?\"\n\n\"I do not think he believes or cares anything! No, what he is trying\nfor is to create such confusion in the minds of the jury that they are\ndivided in their opinion as to which brother did it. He is endeavouring\nto make out that there is quite as much evidence against Lawrence as\nagainst John--and I am not at all sure that he will not succeed.\"\n\nDetective-inspector Japp was the first witness called when the trial\nwas reopened, and gave his evidence succinctly and briefly. After\nrelating the earlier events, he proceeded:\n\n\"Acting on information received, Superintendent Summerhaye and myself\nsearched the prisoner's room, during his temporary absence from the\nhouse. In his chest of drawers, hidden beneath some underclothing, we\nfound: first, a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez similar to those worn by\nMr. Inglethorp\"--these were exhibited--\"secondly, this phial.\"\n\nThe phial was that already recognized by the chemist's assistant, a\ntiny bottle of blue glass, containing a few grains of a white\ncrystalline powder, and labelled: \"Strychnine Hydro-chloride.", "POISON.\"\n\nA fresh piece of evidence discovered by the detectives since the police\ncourt proceedings was a long, almost new piece of blotting-paper. It\nhad been found in Mrs. Inglethorp's cheque book, and on being reversed\nat a mirror, showed clearly the words: \". . . erything of which I die\npossessed I leave to my beloved husband Alfred Ing...\" This placed\nbeyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour of\nthe deceased lady's husband. Japp then produced the charred fragment of\npaper recovered from the grate, and this, with the discovery of the\nbeard in the attic, completed his evidence.\n\nBut Sir Ernest's cross-examination was yet to come.\n\n\"What day was it when you searched the prisoner's room?\"\n\n\"Tuesday, the 24th of July.\"\n\n\"Exactly a week after the tragedy?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You found these two objects, you say, in the chest of drawers. Was the\ndrawer unlocked?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Does it not strike you as unlikely that a man who had committed a\ncrime should keep the evidence of it in an unlocked drawer for anyone\nto find?\"\n\n\"He might have stowed them there in a hurry.\"\n\n\"But you have just said it was a whole week since the crime. He would\nhave had ample time to remove them and destroy them.\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"There is no perhaps about it. Would he, or would he not have had\nplenty of time to remove and destroy them?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Was the pile of underclothes under which the things were hidden heavy\nor light?\"\n\n\"Heavyish.\"\n\n\"In other words, it was winter underclothing. Obviously, the prisoner\nwould not be likely to go to that drawer?\"\n\n\"Perhaps not.\"\n\n\"Kindly answer my question. Would the prisoner, in the hottest week of\na hot summer, be likely to go to a drawer containing winter\nunderclothing. Yes, or no?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"In that case, is it not possible that the articles in question might\nhave been put there by a third person, and that the prisoner was quite\nunaware of their presence?\"\n\n\"I should not think it likely.\"\n\n\"But it is possible?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That is all.\"\n\nMore evidence followed.", "Evidence as to the financial difficulties in\nwhich the prisoner had found himself at the end of July. Evidence as to\nhis intrigue with Mrs. Raikes--poor Mary, that must have been bitter\nhearing for a woman of her pride. Evelyn Howard had been right in her\nfacts, though her animosity against Alfred Inglethorp had caused her to\njump to the conclusion that he was the person concerned.\n\nLawrence Cavendish was then put into the box. In a low voice, in answer\nto Mr. Philips' questions, he denied having ordered anything from\nParkson's in June. In fact, on June 29th, he had been staying away, in\nWales.\n\nInstantly, Sir Ernest's chin was shooting pugnaciously forward.\n\n\"You deny having ordered a black beard from Parkson's on June 29th?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Ah! In the event of anything happening to your brother, who will\ninherit Styles Court?\"\n\nThe brutality of the question called a flush to Lawrence's pale face.\nThe judge gave vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation, and the\nprisoner in the dock leant forward angrily.\n\nHeavywether cared nothing for his client's anger.\n\n\"Answer my question, if you please.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Lawrence quietly, \"that I should.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by you 'suppose'? Your brother has no children. You\n_would_ inherit it, wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's better,\" said Heavywether, with ferocious geniality. \"And\nyou'd inherit a good slice of money too, wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"Really, Sir Ernest,\" protested the judge, \"these questions are not\nrelevant.\"\n\nSir Ernest bowed, and having shot his arrow proceeded.\n\n\"On Tuesday, the 17th July, you went, I believe, with another guest, to\nvisit the dispensary at the Red Cross Hospital in Tadminster?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did you--while you happened to be alone for a few seconds--unlock the\npoison cupboard, and examine some of the bottles?\"\n\n\"I--I--may have done so.\"\n\n\"I put it to you that you did do so?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nSir Ernest fairly shot the next question at him.\n\n\"Did you examine one bottle in particular?\"\n\n\"No, I do not think so.\"\n\n\"Be careful, Mr. Cavendish. I am referring to a little bottle of\nHydro-chloride of Strychnine.\"", "Lawrence was turning a sickly greenish colour.\n\n\"N--o--I am sure I didn't.\"\n\n\"Then how do you account for the fact that you left the unmistakable\nimpress of your finger-prints on it?\"\n\nThe bullying manner was highly efficacious with a nervous disposition.\n\n\"I--I suppose I must have taken up the bottle.\"\n\n\"I suppose so too! Did you abstract any of the contents of the bottle?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Then why did you take it up?\"\n\n\"I once studied to be a doctor. Such things naturally interest me.\"\n\n\"Ah! So poisons 'naturally interest' you, do they? Still, you waited to\nbe alone before gratifying that 'interest' of yours?\"\n\n\"That was pure chance. If the others had been there, I should have done\njust the same.\"\n\n\"Still, as it happens, the others were not there?\"\n\n\"No, but----\"\n\n\"In fact, during the whole afternoon, you were only alone for a couple\nof minutes, and it happened--I say, it happened--to be during those two\nminutes that you displayed your 'natural interest' in Hydro-chloride of\nStrychnine?\"\n\nLawrence stammered pitiably.\n\n\"I--I----\"\n\nWith a satisfied and expressive countenance, Sir Ernest observed:\n\n\"I have nothing more to ask you, Mr. Cavendish.\"\n\nThis bit of cross-examination had caused great excitement in court. The\nheads of the many fashionably attired women present were busily laid\ntogether, and their whispers became so loud that the judge angrily\nthreatened to have the court cleared if there was not immediate\nsilence.\n\nThere was little more evidence. The hand-writing experts were called\nupon for their opinion of the signature of \"Alfred Inglethorp\" in the\nchemist's poison register. They all declared unanimously that it was\ncertainly not his hand-writing, and gave it as their view that it might\nbe that of the prisoner disguised. Cross-examined, they admitted that\nit might be the prisoner's hand-writing cleverly counterfeited.\n\nSir Ernest Heavywether's speech in opening the case for the defence was\nnot a long one, but it was backed by the full force of his emphatic\nmanner. Never, he said, in the course of his long experience, had he\nknown a charge of murder rest on slighter evidence.", "Not only was it\nentirely circumstantial, but the greater part of it was practically\nunproved. Let them take the testimony they had heard and sift it\nimpartially. The strychnine had been found in a drawer in the\nprisoner's room. That drawer was an unlocked one, as he had pointed\nout, and he submitted that there was no evidence to prove that it was\nthe prisoner who had concealed the poison there. It was, in fact, a\nwicked and malicious attempt on the part of some third person to fix\nthe crime on the prisoner. The prosecution had been unable to produce a\nshred of evidence in support of their contention that it was the\nprisoner who ordered the black beard from Parkson's. The quarrel which\nhad taken place between prisoner and his stepmother was freely\nadmitted, but both it and his financial embarrassments had been grossly\nexaggerated.\n\nHis learned friend--Sir Ernest nodded carelessly at Mr. Philips--had\nstated that if the prisoner were an innocent man, he would have come\nforward at the inquest to explain that it was he, and not Mr.\nInglethorp, who had been the participator in the quarrel. He thought\nthe facts had been misrepresented. What had actually occurred was this.\nThe prisoner, returning to the house on Tuesday evening, had been\nauthoritatively told that there had been a violent quarrel between Mr.\nand Mrs. Inglethorp. No suspicion had entered the prisoner's head that\nanyone could possibly have mistaken his voice for that of Mr.\nInglethorp. He naturally concluded that his stepmother had had two\nquarrels.\n\nThe prosecution averred that on Monday, July 16th, the prisoner had\nentered the chemist's shop in the village, disguised as Mr. Inglethorp.\nThe prisoner, on the contrary, was at that time at a lonely spot called\nMarston's Spinney, where he had been summoned by an anonymous note,\ncouched in blackmailing terms, and threatening to reveal certain\nmatters to his wife unless he complied with its demands. The prisoner\nhad, accordingly, gone to the appointed spot, and after waiting there\nvainly for half an hour had returned home. Unfortunately, he had met\nwith no one on the way there or back who could vouch for the truth of\nhis story, but luckily he had kept the note, and it would be produced\nas evidence.", "As for the statement relating to the destruction of the will, the\nprisoner had formerly practised at the Bar, and was perfectly well\naware that the will made in his favour a year before was automatically\nrevoked by his stepmother's remarriage. He would call evidence to show\nwho did destroy the will, and it was possible that that might open up\nquite a new view of the case.\n\nFinally, he would point out to the jury that there was evidence against\nother people besides John Cavendish. He would direct their attention to\nthe fact that the evidence against Mr. Lawrence Cavendish was quite as\nstrong, if not stronger than that against his brother.\n\nHe would now call the prisoner.\n\nJohn acquitted himself well in the witness-box. Under Sir Ernest's\nskilful handling, he told his tale credibly and well. The anonymous\nnote received by him was produced, and handed to the jury to examine.\nThe readiness with which he admitted his financial difficulties, and\nthe disagreement with his stepmother, lent value to his denials.\n\nAt the close of his examination, he paused, and said:\n\n\"I should like to make one thing clear. I utterly reject and disapprove\nof Sir Ernest Heavywether's insinuations against my brother. My\nbrother, I am convinced, had no more to do with the crime than I have.\"\n\nSir Ernest merely smiled, and noted with a sharp eye that John's\nprotest had produced a very favourable impression on the jury.\n\nThen the cross-examination began.\n\n\"I understand you to say that it never entered your head that the\nwitnesses at the inquest could possibly have mistaken your voice for\nthat of Mr. Inglethorp. Is not that very surprising?\"\n\n\"No, I don't think so. I was told there had been a quarrel between my\nmother and Mr. Inglethorp, and it never occurred to me that such was\nnot really the case.\"\n\n\"Not when the servant Dorcas repeated certain fragments of the\nconversation--fragments which you must have recognized?\"\n\n\"I did not recognize them.\"\n\n\"Your memory must be unusually short!\"\n\n\"No, but we were both angry, and, I think, said more than we meant.", "I\npaid very little attention to my mother's actual words.\"\n\nMr. Philips' incredulous sniff was a triumph of forensic skill. He\npassed on to the subject of the note.\n\n\"You have produced this note very opportunely. Tell me, is there\nnothing familiar about the hand-writing of it?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of.\"\n\n\"Do you not think that it bears a marked resemblance to your own\nhand-writing--carelessly disguised?\"\n\n\"No, I do not think so.\"\n\n\"I put it to you that it is your own hand-writing!\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I put it to you that, anxious to prove an alibi, you conceived the\nidea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment, and wrote this\nnote yourself in order to bear out your statement!\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Is it not a fact that, at the time you claim to have been waiting\nabout at a solitary and unfrequented spot, you were really in the\nchemist's shop in Styles St. Mary, where you purchased strychnine in\nthe name of Alfred Inglethorp?\"\n\n\"No, that is a lie.\"\n\n\"I put it to you that, wearing a suit of Mr. Inglethorp's clothes, with\na black beard trimmed to resemble his, you were there--and signed the\nregister in his name!\"\n\n\"That is absolutely untrue.\"\n\n\"Then I will leave the remarkable similarity of hand-writing between\nthe note, the register, and your own, to the consideration of the\njury,\" said Mr. Philips, and sat down with the air of a man who has\ndone his duty, but who was nevertheless horrified by such deliberate\nperjury.\n\nAfter this, as it was growing late, the case was adjourned till Monday.\n\nPoirot, I noticed, was looking profoundly discouraged. He had that\nlittle frown between the eyes that I knew so well.\n\n\"What is it, Poirot?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Ah, _mon ami_, things are going badly, badly.\"\n\nIn spite of myself, my heart gave a leap of relief. Evidently there was\na likelihood of John Cavendish being acquitted.\n\nWhen we reached the house, my little friend waved aside Mary's offer of\ntea.\n\n\"No, I thank you, madame. I will mount to my room.\"", "I followed him. Still frowning, he went across to the desk and took out\na small pack of patience cards. Then he drew up a chair to the table,\nand, to my utter amazement, began solemnly to build card houses!\n\nMy jaw dropped involuntarily, and he said at once:\n\n\"No, _mon ami_, I am not in my second childhood! I steady my nerves,\nthat is all. This employment requires precision of the fingers. With\nprecision of the fingers goes precision of the brain. And never have I\nneeded that more than now!\"\n\n\"What is the trouble?\" I asked.\n\nWith a great thump on the table, Poirot demolished his carefully built\nup edifice.\n\n\"It is this, _mon ami!_ That I can build card houses seven stories\nhigh, but I cannot\"--thump--\"find\"--thump--\" that last link of which I\nspoke to you.\"\n\nI could not quite tell what to say, so I held my peace, and he began\nslowly building up the cards again, speaking in jerks as he did so.\n\n\"It is done--so! By placing--one card--on another--with\nmathematical--precision!\"\n\nI watched the card house rising under his hands, story by story. He\nnever hesitated or faltered. It was really almost like a conjuring\ntrick.\n\n\"What a steady hand you've got,\" I remarked. \"I believe I've only seen\nyour hand shake once.\"\n\n\"On an occasion when I was enraged, without doubt,\" observed Poirot,\nwith great placidity.\n\n\"Yes indeed! You were in a towering rage. Do you remember? It was when\nyou discovered that the lock of the despatch-case in Mrs. Inglethorp's\nbedroom had been forced. You stood by the mantelpiece, twiddling the\nthings on it in your usual fashion, and your hand shook like a leaf! I\nmust say----\"\n\nBut I stopped suddenly. For Poirot, uttering a hoarse and inarticulate\ncry, again annihilated his masterpiece of cards, and putting his hands\nover his eyes swayed backwards and forwards, apparently suffering the\nkeenest agony.\n\n\"Good heavens, Poirot!\" I cried. \"What is the matter? Are you taken\nill?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" he gasped. \"It is--it is--that I have an idea!\"", "\"Oh!\" I exclaimed, much relieved. \"One of your 'little ideas'?\"\n\n\"Ah, _ma foi_, no!\" replied Poirot frankly. \"This time it is an idea\ngigantic! Stupendous! And you--_you_, my friend, have given it to me!\"\n\nSuddenly clasping me in his arms, he kissed me warmly on both cheeks,\nand before I had recovered from my surprise ran headlong from the room.\n\nMary Cavendish entered at that moment.\n\n\"What _is_ the matter with Monsieur Poirot? He rushed past me crying\nout: 'A garage! For the love of Heaven, direct me to a garage, madame!'\nAnd, before I could answer, he had dashed out into the street.\"\n\nI hurried to the window. True enough, there he was, tearing down the\nstreet, hatless, and gesticulating as he went. I turned to Mary with a\ngesture of despair.\n\n\"He'll be stopped by a policeman in another minute. There he goes,\nround the corner!\"\n\nOur eyes met, and we stared helplessly at one another.\n\n\"What can be the matter?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"I don't know. He was building card houses, when suddenly he said he\nhad an idea, and rushed off as you saw.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mary, \"I expect he will be back before dinner.\"\n\nBut night fell, and Poirot had not returned.\n\nPoirot's abrupt departure had intrigued us all greatly. Sunday morning\nwore away, and still he did not reappear. But about three o'clock a\nferocious and prolonged hooting outside drove us to the window, to see\nPoirot alighting from a car, accompanied by Japp and Summerhaye. The\nlittle man was transformed. He radiated an absurd complacency. He bowed\nwith exaggerated respect to Mary Cavendish.\n\n\"Madame, I have your permission to hold a little _reunion_ in the\n_salon_? It is necessary for everyone to attend.\"\n\nMary smiled sadly.\n\n\"You know, Monsieur Poirot, that you have _carte blanche_ in every\nway.\"\n\n\"You are too amiable, madame.\"\n\nStill beaming, Poirot marshalled us all into the drawing-room, bringing\nforward chairs as he did so.\n\n\"Miss Howard--here. Mademoiselle Cynthia. Monsieur Lawrence. The good\nDorcas. And Annie. _Bien!_ We must delay our proceedings a few minutes\nuntil Mr.", "Inglethorp arrives. I have sent him a note.\"\n\nMiss Howard rose immediately from her seat.\n\n\"If that man comes into the house, I leave it!\"\n\n\"No, no!\" Poirot went up to her and pleaded in a low voice.\n\nFinally Miss Howard consented to return to her chair. A few minutes\nlater Alfred Inglethorp entered the room.\n\nThe company once assembled, Poirot rose from his seat with the air of a\npopular lecturer, and bowed politely to his audience.\n\n\"_Messieurs, mesdames_, as you all know, I was called in by Monsieur\nJohn Cavendish to investigate this case. I at once examined the bedroom\nof the deceased which, by the advice of the doctors, had been kept\nlocked, and was consequently exactly as it had been when the tragedy\noccurred. I found: first, a fragment of green material; second, a stain\non the carpet near the window, still damp; thirdly, an empty box of\nbromide powders.\n\n\"To take the fragment of green material first, I found it caught in the\nbolt of the communicating door between that room and the adjoining one\noccupied by Mademoiselle Cynthia. I handed the fragment over to the\npolice who did not consider it of much importance. Nor did they\nrecognize it for what it was--a piece torn from a green land armlet.\"\n\nThere was a little stir of excitement.\n\n\"Now there was only one person at Styles who worked on the land--Mrs.\nCavendish. Therefore it must have been Mrs. Cavendish who entered the\ndeceased's room through the door communicating with Mademoiselle\nCynthia's room.\"\n\n\"But that door was bolted on the inside!\" I cried.\n\n\"When I examined the room, yes. But in the first place we have only her\nword for it, since it was she who tried that particular door and\nreported it fastened. In the ensuing confusion she would have had ample\nopportunity to shoot the bolt across. I took an early opportunity of\nverifying my conjectures. To begin with, the fragment corresponds\nexactly with a tear in Mrs. Cavendish's armlet. Also, at the inquest,\nMrs. Cavendish declared that she had heard, from her own room, the fall\nof the table by the bed.", "I took an early opportunity of testing that\nstatement by stationing my friend Monsieur Hastings in the left wing of\nthe building, just outside Mrs. Cavendish's door. I myself, in company\nwith the police, went to the deceased's room, and whilst there I,\napparently accidentally, knocked over the table in question, but found\nthat, as I had expected, Monsieur Hastings had heard no sound at all.\nThis confirmed my belief that Mrs. Cavendish was not speaking the truth\nwhen she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of\nthe tragedy. In fact, I was convinced that, far from having been in her\nown room, Mrs. Cavendish was actually in the deceased's room when the\nalarm was given.\"\n\nI shot a quick glance at Mary. She was very pale, but smiling.\n\n\"I proceeded to reason on that assumption. Mrs. Cavendish is in her\nmother-in-law's room. We will say that she is seeking for something and\nhas not yet found it. Suddenly Mrs. Inglethorp awakens and is seized\nwith an alarming paroxysm. She flings out her arm, overturning the bed\ntable, and then pulls desperately at the bell. Mrs. Cavendish,\nstartled, drops her candle, scattering the grease on the carpet. She\npicks it up, and retreats quickly to Mademoiselle Cynthia's room,\nclosing the door behind her. She hurries out into the passage, for the\nservants must not find her where she is. But it is too late! Already\nfootsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings.\nWhat can she do? Quick as thought, she hurries back to the young girl's\nroom, and starts shaking her awake. The hastily aroused household come\ntrooping down the passage. They are all busily battering at Mrs.\nInglethorp's door. It occurs to nobody that Mrs. Cavendish has not\narrived with the rest, but--and this is significant--I can find no one\nwho saw her come from the other wing.\" He looked at Mary Cavendish. \"Am\nI right, madame?\"\n\nShe bowed her head.\n\n\"Quite right, monsieur. You understand that, if I had thought I would\ndo my husband any good by revealing these facts, I would have done so.", "But it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of his guilt or\ninnocence.\"\n\n\"In a sense, that is correct, madame. But it cleared my mind of many\nmisconceptions, and left me free to see other facts in their true\nsignificance.\"\n\n\"The will!\" cried Lawrence. \"Then it was you, Mary, who destroyed the\nwill?\"\n\nShe shook her head, and Poirot shook his also.\n\n\"No,\" he said quietly. \"There is only one person who could possibly\nhave destroyed that will--Mrs. Inglethorp herself!\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" I exclaimed. \"She had only made it out that very\nafternoon!\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, _mon ami_, it was Mrs. Inglethorp. Because, in no other\nway can you account for the fact that, on one of the hottest days of\nthe year, Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire to be lighted in her room.\"\n\nI gave a gasp. What idiots we had been never to think of that fire as\nbeing incongruous! Poirot was continuing:\n\n\"The temperature on that day, messieurs, was 80 degrees in the shade.\nYet Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire! Why? Because she wished to destroy\nsomething, and could think of no other way. You will remember that, in\nconsequence of the War economics practiced at Styles, no waste paper\nwas thrown away. There was therefore no means of destroying a thick\ndocument such as a will. The moment I heard of a fire being lighted in\nMrs. Inglethorp's room, I leaped to the conclusion that it was to\ndestroy some important document--possibly a will. So the discovery of\nthe charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me. I did not, of\ncourse, know at the time that the will in question had only been made\nthis afternoon, and I will admit that, when I learnt that fact, I fell\ninto a grievous error. I came to the conclusion that Mrs. Inglethorp's\ndetermination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the\nquarrel she had that afternoon, and that therefore the quarrel took\nplace after, and not before the making of the will.\n\n\"Here, as we know, I was wrong, and I was forced to abandon that idea.", "I faced the problem from a new standpoint. Now, at four o'clock, Dorcas\noverheard her mistress saying angrily: 'You need not think that any\nfear of publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.\"\nI conjectured, and conjectured rightly, that these words were\naddressed, not to her husband, but to Mr. John Cavendish. At five\no'clock, an hour later, she uses almost the same words, but the\nstandpoint is different. She admits to Dorcas, 'I don't know what to\ndo; scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing.' At four\no'clock she has been angry, but completely mistress of herself. At five\no'clock she is in violent distress, and speaks of having had a great\nshock.\n\n\"Looking at the matter psychologically, I drew one deduction which I\nwas convinced was correct. The second 'scandal' she spoke of was not\nthe same as the first--and it concerned herself!\n\n\"Let us reconstruct. At four o'clock, Mrs. Inglethorp quarrels with her\nson, and threatens to denounce him to his wife--who, by the way,\noverheard the greater part of the conversation. At four-thirty, Mrs.\nInglethorp, in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills,\nmakes a will in favour of her husband, which the two gardeners witness.\nAt five o'clock, Dorcas finds her mistress in a state of considerable\nagitation, with a slip of paper--'a letter,' Dorcas thinks--in her hand,\nand it is then that she orders the fire in her room to be lighted.\nPresumably, then, between four-thirty and five o'clock, something has\noccurred to occasion a complete revolution of feeling, since she is now\nas anxious to destroy the will, as she was before to make it. What was\nthat something?\n\n\"As far as we know, she was quite alone during that half-hour. Nobody\nentered or left that boudoir. What then occasioned this sudden change\nof sentiment?\n\n\"One can only guess, but I believe my guess to be correct. Mrs.\nInglethorp had no stamps in her desk. We know this, because later she\nasked Dorcas to bring her some. Now in the opposite corner of the room\nstood her husband's desk--locked.", "She was anxious to find some stamps,\nand, according to my theory, she tried her own keys in the desk. That\none of them fitted I know. She therefore opened the desk, and in\nsearching for the stamps she came across something else--that slip of\npaper which Dorcas saw in her hand, and which assuredly was never meant\nfor Mrs. Inglethorp's eyes. On the other hand, Mrs. Cavendish believed\nthat the slip of paper to which her mother-in-law clung so tenaciously\nwas a written proof of her own husband's infidelity. She demanded it\nfrom Mrs. Inglethorp who assured her, quite truly, that it had nothing\nto do with that matter. Mrs. Cavendish did not believe her. She thought\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp was shielding her stepson. Now Mrs. Cavendish is a\nvery resolute woman, and, behind her mask of reserve, she was madly\njealous of her husband. She determined to get hold of that paper at all\ncosts, and in this resolution chance came to her aid. She happened to\npick up the key of Mrs. Inglethorp's despatch-case, which had been lost\nthat morning. She knew that her mother-in-law invariably kept all\nimportant papers in this particular case.\n\n\"Mrs. Cavendish, therefore, made her plans as only a woman driven\ndesperate through jealousy could have done. Some time in the evening\nshe unbolted the door leading into Mademoiselle Cynthia's room.\nPossibly she applied oil to the hinges, for I found that it opened\nquite noiselessly when I tried it. She put off her project until the\nearly hours of the morning as being safer, since the servants were\naccustomed to hearing her move about her room at that time. She dressed\ncompletely in her land kit, and made her way quietly through\nMademoiselle Cynthia's room into that of Mrs. Inglethorp.\"\n\nHe paused a moment, and Cynthia interrupted:\n\n\"But I should have woken up if anyone had come through my room?\"\n\n\"Not if you were drugged, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Drugged?\"\n\n\"_Mais, oui!_\"\n\n\"You remember\"--he addressed us collectively again--\"that through all the\ntumult and noise next door Mademoiselle Cynthia slept.", "That admitted of\ntwo possibilities. Either her sleep was feigned--which I did not\nbelieve--or her unconsciousness was indeed by artificial means.\n\n\"With this latter idea in my mind, I examined all the coffee-cups most\ncarefully, remembering that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had brought\nMademoiselle Cynthia her coffee the night before. I took a sample from\neach cup, and had them analysed--with no result. I had counted the cups\ncarefully, in the event of one having been removed. Six persons had\ntaken coffee, and six cups were duly found. I had to confess myself\nmistaken.\n\n\"Then I discovered that I had been guilty of a very grave oversight.\nCoffee had been brought in for seven persons, not six, for Dr.\nBauerstein had been there that evening. This changed the face of the\nwhole affair, for there was now one cup missing. The servants noticed\nnothing, since Annie, the housemaid, who took in the coffee, brought in\nseven cups, not knowing that Mr. Inglethorp never drank it, whereas\nDorcas, who cleared them away the following morning, found six as\nusual--or strictly speaking she found five, the sixth being the one\nfound broken in Mrs. Inglethorp's room.\n\n\"I was confident that the missing cup was that of Mademoiselle Cynthia.\nI had an additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the\ncups found contained sugar, which Mademoiselle Cynthia never took in\nher coffee. My attention was attracted by the story of Annie about some\n'salt' on the tray of cocoa which she took every night to Mrs.\nInglethorp's room. I accordingly secured a sample of that cocoa, and\nsent it to be analysed.\"\n\n\"But that had already been done by Dr. Bauerstein,\" said Lawrence\nquickly.\n\n\"Not exactly. The analyst was asked by him to report whether strychnine\nwas, or was not, present. He did not have it tested, as I did, for a\nnarcotic.\"\n\n\"For a narcotic?\"\n\n\"Yes. Here is the analyst's report. Mrs. Cavendish administered a safe,\nbut effectual, narcotic to both Mrs. Inglethorp and Mademoiselle\nCynthia. And it is possible that she had a _mauvais quart d'heure_ in\nconsequence!", "Imagine her feelings when her mother-in-law is suddenly\ntaken ill and dies, and immediately after she hears the word 'Poison'!\nShe has believed that the sleeping draught she administered was\nperfectly harmless, but there is no doubt that for one terrible moment\nshe must have feared that Mrs. Inglethorp's death lay at her door. She\nis seized with panic, and under its influence she hurries downstairs,\nand quickly drops the coffee-cup and saucer used by Mademoiselle\nCynthia into a large brass vase, where it is discovered later by\nMonsieur Lawrence. The remains of the cocoa she dare not touch. Too\nmany eyes are upon her. Guess at her relief when strychnine is\nmentioned, and she discovers that after all the tragedy is not her\ndoing.\n\n\"We are now able to account for the symptoms of strychnine poisoning\nbeing so long in making their appearance. A narcotic taken with\nstrychnine will delay the action of the poison for some hours.\"\n\nPoirot paused. Mary looked up at him, the colour slowly rising in her\nface.\n\n\"All you have said is quite true, Monsieur Poirot. It was the most\nawful hour of my life. I shall never forget it. But you are wonderful.\nI understand now----\"\n\n\"What I meant when I told you that you could safely confess to Papa\nPoirot, eh? But you would not trust me.\"\n\n\"I see everything now,\" said Lawrence. \"The drugged cocoa, taken on top\nof the poisoned coffee, amply accounts for the delay.\"\n\n\"Exactly. But was the coffee poisoned, or was it not? We come to a\nlittle difficulty here, since Mrs. Inglethorp never drank it.\"\n\n\"What?\" The cry of surprise was universal.\n\n\"No. You will remember my speaking of a stain on the carpet in Mrs.\nInglethorp's room? There were some peculiar points about that stain. It\nwas still damp, it exhaled a strong odour of coffee, and imbedded in\nthe nap of the carpet I found some little splinters of china. What had\nhappened was plain to me, for not two minutes before I had placed my\nlittle case on the table near the window, and the table, tilting up,\nhad deposited it upon the floor on precisely the identical spot.", "In\nexactly the same way, Mrs. Inglethorp had laid down her cup of coffee\non reaching her room the night before, and the treacherous table had\nplayed her the same trick.\n\n\"What happened next is mere guess work on my part, but I should say\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp picked up the broken cup and placed it on the\ntable by the bed. Feeling in need of a stimulant of some kind, she\nheated up her cocoa, and drank it off then and there. Now we are faced\nwith a new problem. We know the cocoa contained no strychnine. The\ncoffee was never drunk. Yet the strychnine must have been administered\nbetween seven and nine o'clock that evening. What third medium was\nthere--a medium so suitable for disguising the taste of strychnine that\nit is extraordinary no one has thought of it?\" Poirot looked round the\nroom, and then answered himself impressively. \"Her medicine!\"\n\n\"Do you mean that the murderer introduced the strychnine into her\ntonic?\" I cried.\n\n\"There was no need to introduce it. It was already there--in the\nmixture. The strychnine that killed Mrs. Inglethorp was the identical\nstrychnine prescribed by Dr. Wilkins. To make that clear to you, I will\nread you an extract from a book on dispensing which I found in the\nDispensary of the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster:\n\n\"'The following prescription has become famous in text books:\n\n\n          Strychninae Sulph. . . . . . 1 gr.\n\n          Potass Bromide . . . . . . . 3vi\n\n          Aqua ad. . . . . . . . . . . . . 3viii\n\n          Fiat Mistura\n\n\n_This solution deposits in a few hours the greater part of the\nstrychnine salt as an insoluble bromide in transparent crystals. A lady\nin England lost her life by taking a similar mixture: the precipitated\nstrychnine collected at the bottom, and in taking the last dose she\nswallowed nearly all of it!_\n\n\"Now there was, of course, no bromide in Dr. Wilkins' prescription, but\nyou will remember that I mentioned an empty box of bromide powders. One\nor two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine\nwould effectually precipitate the strychnine, as the book describes,\nand cause it to be taken in the last dose.", "You will learn later that\nthe person who usually poured out Mrs. Inglethorp's medicine was always\nextremely careful not to shake the bottle, but to leave the sediment at\nthe bottom of it undisturbed.\n\n\"Throughout the case, there have been evidences that the tragedy was\nintended to take place on Monday evening. On that day, Mrs.\nInglethorp's bell wire was neatly cut, and on Monday evening\nMademoiselle Cynthia was spending the night with friends, so that Mrs.\nInglethorp would have been quite alone in the right wing, completely\nshut off from help of any kind, and would have died, in all\nprobability, before medical aid could have been summoned. But in her\nhurry to be in time for the village entertainment Mrs. Inglethorp\nforgot to take her medicine, and the next day she lunched away from\nhome, so that the last--and fatal--dose was actually taken twenty-four\nhours later than had been anticipated by the murderer; and it is owing\nto that delay that the final proof--the last link of the chain--is now in\nmy hands.\"\n\nAmid breathless excitement, he held out three thin strips of paper.\n\n\"A letter in the murderer's own hand-writing, _mes amis!_ Had it been a\nlittle clearer in its terms, it is possible that Mrs. Inglethorp,\nwarned in time, would have escaped. As it was, she realized her danger,\nbut not the manner of it.\"\n\nIn the deathly silence, Poirot pieced together the slips of paper and,\nclearing his throat, read:\n\nDearest Evelyn:\n\n    'You will be anxious at hearing nothing. It is all right--only it\n    will be to-night instead of last night. You understand. There's a\n    good time coming once the old woman is dead and out of the way. No\n    one can possibly bring home the crime to me. That idea of yours\n    about the bromides was a stroke of genius! But we must be very\n    circumspect. A false step----'\n\n\n\"Here, my friends, the letter breaks off. Doubtless the writer was\ninterrupted; but there can be no question as to his identity. We all\nknow this hand-writing and----\"\n\nA howl that was almost a scream broke the silence.", "\"You devil! How did you get it?\"\n\nA chair was overturned. Poirot skipped nimbly aside. A quick movement\non his part, and his assailant fell with a crash.\n\n\"_Messieurs, mesdames_,\" said Poirot, with a flourish, \"let me\nintroduce you to the murderer, Mr. Alfred Inglethorp!\"\n\n\"Poirot, you old villain,\" I said, \"I've half a mind to strangle you!\nWhat do you mean by deceiving me as you have done?\"\n\nWe were sitting in the library. Several hectic days lay behind us. In\nthe room below, John and Mary were together once more, while Alfred\nInglethorp and Miss Howard were in custody. Now at last, I had Poirot\nto myself, and could relieve my still burning curiosity.\n\nPoirot did not answer me for a moment, but at last he said:\n\n\"I did not deceive you, _mon ami_. At most, I permitted you to deceive\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Yes, but why?\"\n\n\"Well, it is difficult to explain. You see, my friend, you have a\nnature so honest, and a countenance so transparent, that--_enfin_, to\nconceal your feelings is impossible! If I had told you my ideas, the\nvery first time you saw Mr. Alfred Inglethorp that astute gentleman\nwould have--in your so expressive idiom--'smelt a rat'! And then,\n_bonjour_ to our chances of catching him!\"\n\n\"I think that I have more diplomacy than you give me credit for.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" besought Poirot, \"I implore you, do not enrage yourself!\nYour help has been of the most invaluable. It is but the extremely\nbeautiful nature that you have, which made me pause.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I grumbled, a little mollified. \"I still think you might have\ngiven me a hint.\"\n\n\"But I did, my friend. Several hints. You would not take them. Think\nnow, did I ever say to you that I believed John Cavendish guilty? Did I\nnot, on the contrary, tell you that he would almost certainly be\nacquitted?\"\n\n\"Yes, but----\"\n\n\"And did I not immediately afterwards speak of the difficulty of\nbringing the murderer to justice? Was it not plain to you that I was\nspeaking of two entirely different persons?\"", "\"No,\" I said, \"it was not plain to me!\"\n\n\"Then again,\" continued Poirot, \"at the beginning, did I not repeat to\nyou several times that I didn't want Mr. Inglethorp arrested _now_?\nThat should have conveyed something to you.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say you suspected him as long ago as that?\"\n\n\"Yes. To begin with, whoever else might benefit by Mrs. Inglethorp's\ndeath, her husband would benefit the most. There was no getting away\nfrom that. When I went up to Styles with you that first day, I had no\nidea as to how the crime had been committed, but from what I knew of\nMr. Inglethorp I fancied that it would be very hard to find anything to\nconnect him with it. When I arrived at the chateau, I realized at once\nthat it was Mrs. Inglethorp who had burnt the will; and there, by the\nway, you cannot complain, my friend, for I tried my best to force on\nyou the significance of that bedroom fire in midsummer.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" I said impatiently. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"Well, my friend, as I say, my views as to Mr. Inglethorp's guilt were\nvery much shaken. There was, in fact, so much evidence against him that\nI was inclined to believe that he had not done it.\"\n\n\"When did you change your mind?\"\n\n\"When I found that the more efforts I made to clear him, the more\nefforts he made to get himself arrested. Then, when I discovered that\nInglethorp had nothing to do with Mrs. Raikes and that in fact it was\nJohn Cavendish who was interested in that quarter, I was quite sure.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"Simply this. If it had been Inglethorp who was carrying on an intrigue\nwith Mrs. Raikes, his silence was perfectly comprehensible. But, when I\ndiscovered that it was known all over the village that it was John who\nwas attracted by the farmer's pretty wife, his silence bore quite a\ndifferent interpretation. It was nonsense to pretend that he was afraid\nof the scandal, as no possible scandal could attach to him. This\nattitude of his gave me furiously to think, and I was slowly forced to\nthe conclusion that Alfred Inglethorp wanted to be arrested.", "_Eh bien!_\nfrom that moment, I was equally determined that he should not be\narrested.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute. I don't see why he wished to be arrested?\"\n\n\"Because, _mon ami_, it is the law of your country that a man once\nacquitted can never be tried again for the same offence. Aha! but it\nwas clever--his idea! Assuredly, he is a man of method. See here, he\nknew that in his position he was bound to be suspected, so he conceived\nthe exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence\nagainst himself. He wished to be arrested. He would then produce his\nirreproachable alibi--and, hey presto, he was safe for life!\"\n\n\"But I still don't see how he managed to prove his alibi, and yet go to\nthe chemist's shop?\"\n\nPoirot stared at me in surprise.\n\n\"Is it possible? My poor friend! You have not yet realized that it was\nMiss Howard who went to the chemist's shop?\"\n\n\"Miss Howard?\"\n\n\"But, certainly. Who else? It was most easy for her. She is of a good\nheight, her voice is deep and manly; moreover, remember, she and\nInglethorp are cousins, and there is a distinct resemblance between\nthem, especially in their gait and bearing. It was simplicity itself.\nThey are a clever pair!\"\n\n\"I am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was\ndone,\" I remarked.\n\n\"_Bon!_ I will reconstruct for you as far as possible. I am inclined to\nthink that Miss Howard was the master mind in that affair. You remember\nher once mentioning that her father was a doctor? Possibly she\ndispensed his medicines for him, or she may have taken the idea from\none of the many books lying about when Mademoiselle Cynthia was\nstudying for her exam. Anyway, she was familiar with the fact that the\naddition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause\nthe precipitation of the latter. Probably the idea came to her quite\nsuddenly. Mrs. Inglethorp had a box of bromide powders, which she\noccasionally took at night. What could be easier than quietly to\ndissolve one or more of those powders in Mrs.", "Inglethorp's large sized\nbottle of medicine when it came from Coot's? The risk is practically\nnil. The tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later. If\nanyone has seen either of them touching the medicine, they will have\nforgotten it by that time. Miss Howard will have engineered her\nquarrel, and departed from the house. The lapse of time, and her\nabsence, will defeat all suspicion. Yes, it was a clever idea! If they\nhad left it alone, it is possible the crime might never have been\nbrought home to them. But they were not satisfied. They tried to be too\nclever--and that was their undoing.\"\n\nPoirot puffed at his tiny cigarette, his eyes fixed on the ceiling.\n\n\"They arranged a plan to throw suspicion on John Cavendish, by buying\nstrychnine at the village chemist's, and signing the register in his\nhand-writing.\n\n\"On Monday Mrs. Inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicine. On\nMonday, therefore, at six o'clock, Alfred Inglethorp arranges to be\nseen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village. Miss\nHoward has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and Mrs.\nRaikes to account for his holding his tongue afterwards. At six\no'clock, Miss Howard, disguised as Alfred Inglethorp, enters the\nchemist's shop, with her story about a dog, obtains the strychnine, and\nwrites the name of Alfred Inglethorp in John's handwriting, which she\nhad previously studied carefully.\n\n\"But, as it will never do if John, too, can prove an alibi, she writes\nhim an anonymous note--still copying his hand-writing--which takes him to\na remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see\nhim.\n\n\"So far, all goes well. Miss Howard goes back to Middlingham. Alfred\nInglethorp returns to Styles. There is nothing that can compromise him\nin any way, since it is Miss Howard who has the strychnine, which,\nafter all, is only wanted as a blind to throw suspicion on John\nCavendish.\n\n\"But now a hitch occurs. Mrs. Inglethorp does not take her medicine\nthat night.", "The broken bell, Cynthia's absence--arranged by Inglethorp\nthrough his wife--all these are wasted. And then--he makes his slip.\n\n\"Mrs. Inglethorp is out, and he sits down to write to his accomplice,\nwho, he fears, may be in a panic at the non-success of their plan. It\nis probable that Mrs. Inglethorp returned earlier than he expected.\nCaught in the act, and somewhat flurried he hastily shuts and locks his\ndesk. He fears that if he remains in the room he may have to open it\nagain, and that Mrs. Inglethorp might catch sight of the letter before\nhe could snatch it up. So he goes out and walks in the woods, little\ndreaming that Mrs. Inglethorp will open his desk, and discover the\nincriminating document.\n\n\"But this, as we know, is what happened. Mrs. Inglethorp reads it, and\nbecomes aware of the perfidy of her husband and Evelyn Howard, though,\nunfortunately, the sentence about the bromides conveys no warning to\nher mind. She knows that she is in danger--but is ignorant of where the\ndanger lies. She decides to say nothing to her husband, but sits down\nand writes to her solicitor, asking him to come on the morrow, and she\nalso determines to destroy immediately the will which she has just\nmade. She keeps the fatal letter.\"\n\n\"It was to discover that letter, then, that her husband forced the lock\nof the despatch-case?\"\n\n\"Yes, and from the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he\nrealized its importance. That letter excepted, there was absolutely\nnothing to connect him with the crime.\"\n\n\"There's only one thing I can't make out, why didn't he destroy it at\nonce when he got hold of it?\"\n\n\"Because he did not dare take the biggest risk of all--that of keeping\nit on his own person.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Look at it from his point of view. I have discovered that there were\nonly five short minutes in which he could have taken it--the five\nminutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene, for before\nthat time Annie was brushing the stairs, and would have seen anyone who\npassed going to the right wing.", "Figure to yourself the scene! He enters\nthe room, unlocking the door by means of one of the other doorkeys--they\nwere all much alike. He hurries to the despatch-case--it is locked, and\nthe keys are nowhere to be seen. That is a terrible blow to him, for it\nmeans that his presence in the room cannot be concealed as he had\nhoped. But he sees clearly that everything must be risked for the sake\nof that damning piece of evidence. Quickly, he forces the lock with a\npenknife, and turns over the papers until he finds what he is looking\nfor.\n\n\"But now a fresh dilemma arises: he dare not keep that piece of paper\non him. He may be seen leaving the room--he may be searched. If the\npaper is found on him, it is certain doom. Probably, at this minute,\ntoo, he hears the sounds below of Mr. Wells and John leaving the\nboudoir. He must act quickly. Where can he hide this terrible slip of\npaper? The contents of the waste-paper-basket are kept and in any case,\nare sure to be examined. There are no means of destroying it; and he\ndare not keep it. He looks round, and he sees--what do you think, _mon\nami?_\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"In a moment, he has torn the letter into long thin strips, and rolling\nthem up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other\nspills in the vase on the mantle-piece.\"\n\nI uttered an exclamation.\n\n\"No one would think of looking there,\" Poirot continued. \"And he will\nbe able, at his leisure, to come back and destroy this solitary piece\nof evidence against him.\"\n\n\"Then, all the time, it was in the spill vase in Mrs. Inglethorp's\nbedroom, under our very noses?\" I cried.\n\nPoirot nodded.\n\n\"Yes, my friend. That is where I discovered my 'last link,' and I owe\nthat very fortunate discovery to you.\"\n\n\"To me?\"\n\n\"Yes. Do you remember telling me that my hand shook as I was\nstraightening the ornaments on the mantelpiece?\"", "\"Yes, but I don't see----\"\n\n\"No, but I saw. Do you know, my friend, I remembered that earlier in\nthe morning, when we had been there together, I had straightened all\nthe objects on the mantelpiece. And, if they were already straightened,\nthere would be no need to straighten them again, unless, in the\nmeantime, someone else had touched them.\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" I murmured, \"so that is the explanation of your\nextraordinary behaviour. You rushed down to Styles, and found it still\nthere?\"\n\n\"Yes, and it was a race for time.\"\n\n\"But I still can't understand why Inglethorp was such a fool as to\nleave it there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy it.\"\n\n\"Ah, but he had no opportunity. _I_ saw to that.\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"Yes. Do you remember reproving me for taking the household into my\nconfidence on the subject?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, my friend, I saw there was just one chance. I was not sure then\nif Inglethorp was the criminal or not, but if he was I reasoned that he\nwould not have the paper on him, but would have hidden it somewhere,\nand by enlisting the sympathy of the household I could effectually\nprevent his destroying it. He was already under suspicion, and by\nmaking the matter public I secured the services of about ten amateur\ndetectives, who would be watching him unceasingly, and being himself\naware of their watchfulness he would not dare seek further to destroy\nthe document. He was therefore forced to depart from the house, leaving\nit in the spill vase.\"\n\n\"But surely Miss Howard had ample opportunities of aiding him.\"\n\n\"Yes, but Miss Howard did not know of the paper's existence. In\naccordance with their prearranged plan, she never spoke to Alfred\nInglethorp. They were supposed to be deadly enemies, and until John\nCavendish was safely convicted they neither of them dared risk a\nmeeting. Of course I had a watch kept on Mr. Inglethorp, hoping that\nsooner or later he would lead me to the hiding-place. But he was too\nclever to take any chances. The paper was safe where it was; since no\none had thought of looking there in the first week, it was not likely\nthey would do so afterwards.", "But for your lucky remark, we might never\nhave been able to bring him to justice.\"\n\n\"I understand that now; but when did you first begin to suspect Miss\nHoward?\"\n\n\"When I discovered that she had told a lie at the inquest about the\nletter she had received from Mrs. Inglethorp.\"\n\n\"Why, what was there to lie about?\"\n\n\"You saw that letter? Do you recall its general appearance?\"\n\n\"Yes--more or less.\"\n\n\"You will recollect, then, that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote a very\ndistinctive hand, and left large clear spaces between her words. But if\nyou look at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that\n'July 17th' is quite different in this respect. Do you see what I\nmean?\"\n\n\"No,\" I confessed, \"I don't.\"\n\n\"You do not see that that letter was not written on the 17th, but on\nthe 7th--the day after Miss Howard's departure? The '1' was written in\nbefore the '7' to turn it into the '17th'.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"That is exactly what I asked myself. Why does Miss Howard suppress the\nletter written on the 17th, and produce this faked one instead? Because\nshe did not wish to show the letter of the 17th. Why, again? And at\nonce a suspicion dawned in my mind. You will remember my saying that it\nwas wise to beware of people who were not telling you the truth.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" I cried indignantly, \"after that, you gave me two reasons\nwhy Miss Howard could not have committed the crime!\"\n\n\"And very good reasons too,\" replied Poirot. \"For a long time they were\na stumbling-block to me until I remembered a very significant fact:\nthat she and Alfred Inglethorp were cousins. She could not have\ncommitted the crime single-handed, but the reasons against that did not\ndebar her from being an accomplice. And, then, there was that rather\nover-vehement hatred of hers! It concealed a very opposite emotion.\nThere was, undoubtedly, a tie of passion between them long before he\ncame to Styles. They had already arranged their infamous plot--that he\nshould marry this rich, but rather foolish old lady, induce her to make\na will leaving her money to him, and then gain their ends by a very\ncleverly conceived crime.", "If all had gone as they planned, they would\nprobably have left England, and lived together on their poor victim's\nmoney.\n\n\"They are a very astute and unscrupulous pair. While suspicion was to\nbe directed against him, she would be making quiet preparations for a\nvery different _denouement_. She arrives from Middlingham with all the\ncompromising items in her possession. No suspicion attaches to her. No\nnotice is paid to her coming and going in the house. She hides the\nstrychnine and glasses in John's room. She puts the beard in the attic.\nShe will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered.\"\n\n\"I don't quite see why they tried to fix the blame on John,\" I\nremarked. \"It would have been much easier for them to bring the crime\nhome to Lawrence.\"\n\n\"Yes, but that was mere chance. All the evidence against him arose out\nof pure accident. It must, in fact, have been distinctly annoying to\nthe pair of schemers.\"\n\n\"His manner was unfortunate,\" I observed thoughtfully.\n\n\"Yes. You realize, of course, what was at the back of that?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You did not understand that he believed Mademoiselle Cynthia guilty of\nthe crime?\"\n\n\"No,\" I exclaimed, astonished. \"Impossible!\"\n\n\"Not at all. I myself nearly had the same idea. It was in my mind when\nI asked Mr. Wells that first question about the will. Then there were\nthe bromide powders which she had made up, and her clever male\nimpersonations, as Dorcas recounted them to us. There was really more\nevidence against her than anyone else.\"\n\n\"You are joking, Poirot!\"\n\n\"No. Shall I tell you what made Monsieur Lawrence turn so pale when he\nfirst entered his mother's room on the fatal night? It was because,\nwhilst his mother lay there, obviously poisoned, he saw, over your\nshoulder, that the door into Mademoiselle Cynthia's room was unbolted.\"\n\n\"But he declared that he saw it bolted!\" I cried.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Poirot dryly. \"And that was just what confirmed my\nsuspicion that it was not. He was shielding Mademoiselle Cynthia.\"\n\n\"But why should he shield her?\"\n\n\"Because he is in love with her.\"", "I laughed.\n\n\"There, Poirot, you are quite wrong! I happen to know for a fact that,\nfar from being in love with her, he positively dislikes her.\"\n\n\"Who told you that, _mon ami?_\"\n\n\"Cynthia herself.\"\n\n\"_La pauvre petite!_ And she was concerned?\"\n\n\"She said that she did not mind at all.\"\n\n\"Then she certainly did mind very much,\" remarked Poirot. \"They are\nlike that--_les femmes!_\"\n\n\"What you say about Lawrence is a great surprise to me,\" I said.\n\n\"But why? It was most obvious. Did not Monsieur Lawrence make the sour\nface every time Mademoiselle Cynthia spoke and laughed with his\nbrother? He had taken it into his long head that Mademoiselle Cynthia\nwas in love with Monsieur John. When he entered his mother's room, and\nsaw her obviously poisoned, he jumped to the conclusion that\nMademoiselle Cynthia knew something about the matter. He was nearly\ndriven desperate. First he crushed the coffee-cup to powder under his\nfeet, remembering that _she_ had gone up with his mother the night\nbefore, and he determined that there should be no chance of testing its\ncontents. Thenceforward, he strenuously, and quite uselessly, upheld\nthe theory of 'Death from natural causes'.\"\n\n\"And what about the 'extra coffee-cup'?\"\n\n\"I was fairly certain that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had hidden it, but\nI had to make sure. Monsieur Lawrence did not know at all what I meant;\nbut, on reflection, he came to the conclusion that if he could find an\nextra coffee-cup anywhere his lady love would be cleared of suspicion.\nAnd he was perfectly right.\"\n\n\"One thing more. What did Mrs. Inglethorp mean by her dying words?\"\n\n\"They were, of course, an accusation against her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear me, Poirot,\" I said with a sigh, \"I think you have explained\neverything. I am glad it has all ended so happily. Even John and his\nwife are reconciled.\"\n\n\"Thanks to me.\"\n\n\"How do you mean--thanks to you?\"\n\n\"My dear friend, do you not realize that it was simply and solely the\ntrial which has brought them together again? That John Cavendish still\nloved his wife, I was convinced.", "Also, that she was equally in love\nwith him. But they had drifted very far apart. It all arose from a\nmisunderstanding. She married him without love. He knew it. He is a\nsensitive man in his way, he would not force himself upon her if she\ndid not want him. And, as he withdrew, her love awoke. But they are\nboth unusually proud, and their pride held them inexorably apart. He\ndrifted into an entanglement with Mrs. Raikes, and she deliberately\ncultivated the friendship of Dr. Bauerstein. Do you remember the day of\nJohn Cavendish's arrest, when you found me deliberating over a big\ndecision?\"\n\n\"Yes, I quite understood your distress.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, _mon ami_, but you did not understand it in the least. I\nwas trying to decide whether or not I would clear John Cavendish at\nonce. I could have cleared him--though it might have meant a failure to\nconvict the real criminals. They were entirely in the dark as to my\nreal attitude up to the very last moment--which partly accounts for my\nsuccess.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that you could have saved John Cavendish from being\nbrought to trial?\"\n\n\"Yes, my friend. But I eventually decided in favour of 'a woman's\nhappiness'. Nothing but the great danger through which they have passed\ncould have brought these two proud souls together again.\"\n\nI looked at Poirot in silent amazement. The colossal cheek of the\nlittle man! Who on earth but Poirot would have thought of a trial for\nmurder as a restorer of conjugal happiness!\n\n\"I perceive your thoughts, _mon ami_,\" said Poirot, smiling at me. \"No\none but Hercule Poirot would have attempted such a thing! And you are\nwrong in condemning it. The happiness of one man and one woman is the\ngreatest thing in all the world.\"\n\nHis words took me back to earlier events. I remembered Mary as she lay\nwhite and exhausted on the sofa, listening, listening. There had come\nthe sound of the bell below. She had started up. Poirot had opened the\ndoor, and meeting her agonized eyes had nodded gently.", "\"Yes, madame,\"\nhe said. \"I have brought him back to you.\" He had stood aside, and as I\nwent out I had seen the look in Mary's eyes, as John Cavendish had\ncaught his wife in his arms.\n\n\"Perhaps you are right, Poirot,\" I said gently. \"Yes, it is the\ngreatest thing in the world.\"\n\nSuddenly, there was a tap at the door, and Cynthia peeped in.\n\n\"I--I only----\"\n\n\"Come in,\" I said, springing up.\n\nShe came in, but did not sit down.\n\n\"I--only wanted to tell you something----\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\nCynthia fidgeted with a little tassel for some moments, then, suddenly\nexclaiming: \"You dears!\" kissed first me and then Poirot, and rushed\nout of the room again.\n\n\"What on earth does this mean?\" I asked, surprised.\n\nIt was very nice to be kissed by Cynthia, but the publicity of the\nsalute rather impaired the pleasure.\n\n\"It means that she has discovered Monsieur Lawrence does not dislike\nher as much as she thought,\" replied Poirot philosophically.\n\n\"But----\"\n\n\"Here he is.\"\n\nLawrence at that moment passed the door.\n\n\"Eh! Monsieur Lawrence,\" called Poirot. \"We must congratulate you, is\nit not so?\"\n\nLawrence blushed, and then smiled awkwardly. A man in love is a sorry\nspectacle. Now Cynthia had looked charming.\n\nI sighed.\n\n\"What is it, _mon ami?_\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" I said sadly. \"They are two delightful women!\"\n\n\"And neither of them is for you?\" finished Poirot. \"Never mind. Console\nyourself, my friend. We may hunt together again, who knows? And then----\"\n\n\nNadina, the Russian dancer who had taken Paris by storm, swayed to\nthe sound of the applause, bowed and bowed again. Her narrow black\neyes narrowed themselves still more, the long line of her scarlet\nmouth curved faintly upwards. Enthusiastic Frenchmen continued to\nbeat the ground appreciatively as the curtain fell with a swish,\nhiding the reds and blues and magentas of the bizarre _decors._ In\na swirl of blue and orange draperies the dancer left the stage. A\nbearded gentleman received her enthusiastically in his arms. It\nwas the Manager.\n\n\"Magnificent, _petite,_ magnificent,\" he cried. \"To-night you have\nsurpassed yourself.\"", "He kissed her gallantly on both cheeks in a\nsomewhat matter-of-fact manner.\n\nMadame Nadina accepted the tribute with the ease of long habit and\npassed on to her dressing-room, where bouquets were heaped\ncarelessly everywhere, marvellous garments of futuristic design\nhung on pegs, and the air was hot and sweet with the scent of the\nmassed blossoms and with more sophisticated perfumes and essences.\nJeanne, the dresser, ministered to her mistress, talking incessantly\nand pouring out a stream of fulsome compliment.\n\nA knock at the door interrupted the flow. Jeanne went to answer\nit, and returned with a card in her hand.\n\n\"Madame will receive?\"\n\n\"Let me see.\"\n\nThe dancer stretched out a languid hand, but at the sight of the\nname on the card, \"Count Sergius Paulovitch,\" a sudden flicker of\ninterest came into her eyes.\n\n\"I will see him. The maize _peignoir,_ Jeanne, and quickly. And\nwhen the Count comes you may go.\"\n\n_\"Bien, Madame.\"_\n\nJeanne brought the _peignoir,_ an exquisite wisp of corn-coloured\nchiffon and ermine. Nadina slipped into it, and sat smiling to\nherself, whilst one long white hand beat a slow tattoo on the glass\nof the dressing-table.\n\nThe Count was prompt to avail himself of the privilege accorded to\nhim--a man of medium height, very slim, very elegant, very pale,\nextraordinarily weary. In feature, little to take hold of, a man\ndifficult to recognize again if one left his mannerisms out of\naccount. He bowed over the dancer's hand with exaggerated\ncourtliness.\n\n\"Madame, this is a pleasure indeed.\"\n\nSo much Jeanne heard before she went out closing the door behind\nher. Alone with her visitor, a subtle change came over Nadina's\nsmile.\n\n\"Compatriots though we are, we will not speak Russian, I think,\"\nshe observed.\n\n\"Since we neither of us know a word of the language, it might be\nas well,\" agreed her guest.\n\nBy common consent, they dropped into English, and nobody, now that\nthe Count's mannerisms had dropped from him, could doubt that it\nwas his native language. He had, indeed, started life as a\nquick-change music-hall artiste in London.", "\"You had a great success to-night,\" he remarked. \"I congratulate\nyou.\"\n\n\"All the same,\" said the woman, \"I am disturbed. My position is\nnot what it was. The suspicions aroused during the War have never\ndied down. I am continually watched and spied upon.\"\n\n\"But no charge of espionage was ever brought against you?\"\n\n\"Our chief lays his plans too carefully for that.\"\n\n\"Long life to the 'Colonel,'\" said the Count, smiling. \"Amazing\nnews, is it not, that he means to retire? To retire! Just like a\ndoctor, or a butcher, or a plumber----\"\n\n\"Or any other business man,\" finished Nadina. \"It should not\nsurprise us. That is what the 'Colonel' has always been--an excellent\nman of business. He has organized crime as another man might\norganize a boot factory. Without committing himself, he has planned\nand directed a series of stupendous _coups,_ embracing every branch\nof what we might call his 'profession.' Jewel robberies, forgery,\nespionage (the latter very profitable in war-time), sabotage,\ndiscreet assassination, there is hardly anything he has not touched.\nWisest of all, he knows when to stop. The game begins to be\ndangerous? --he retires gracefully--with an enormous fortune!\"\n\n\"H'm!\" said the Count doubtfully. \"It is rather--upsetting for all\nof us. We are at a loose end, as it were.\"\n\n\"But we are being paid off--on a most generous scale!\" Something,\nsome undercurrent of mockery in her tone, made the man look at her\nsharply. She was smiling to herself, and the quality of her smile\naroused his curiosity. But he proceeded diplomatically:\n\n\"Yes, the 'Colonel' has always been a generous paymaster. I\nattribute much of his success to that--and to his invariable plan\nof providing a suitable scapegoat. A great brain, undoubtedly a\ngreat brain! And an apostle of the maxim, 'If you want a thing done\nsafely, do not do it yourself!' Here are we, every one of us\nincriminated up to the hilt and absolutely in his power, and not\none of us has anything on him.\"\n\nHe paused, almost as though he were expecting her to disagree with\nhim, but she remained silent, smiling to herself as before.", "\"Not one of us,\" he mused. \"Still, you know, he is superstitious,\nthe old man. Years ago, I believe, he went to one of these\nfortune-telling people. She prophesied a lifetime of success, but\ndeclared that his downfall would be brought about through a woman.\"\n\nHe had interested her now. She looked up eagerly.\n\n\"That is strange, very strange! Through a woman, you say?\"\n\nHe smiled and shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Doubtless, now that he has--retired, he will marry. Some young\nsociety beauty, who will disperse his millions faster than he\nacquired them.\"\n\nNadina shook her head.\n\n\"No, no, that is not the way of it. Listen, my friend, to-morrow\nI go to London.\"\n\n\"But your contract here?\"\n\n\"I shall be away only one night. And I go incognito, like Royalty.\nNo one will ever know that I have left France. And why do you think\nthat I go?\"\n\n\"Hardly for pleasure at this time of year. January, a detestable\nfoggy month! It must be for profit, eh?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\" She rose and stood in front of him, every graceful line\nof her arrogant with pride. \"You said just now that none of us had\nanything on the chief. You were wrong. I have. I, a woman, have\nhad the wit and, yes, the courage--for it needs courage--to\ndouble-cross him. You remember the De Beer diamonds?\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember. At Kimberley, just before the war broke out? I\nhad nothing to do with it, and I never heard the details, the case\nwas hushed up for some reason, was it not? A fine haul too.\"\n\n\"A hundred thousand pounds worth of stones. Two of us worked\nit--under the 'Colonel's' orders, of course. And it was then that\nI saw my chance. You see, the plan was to substitute some of the\nDe Beer diamonds for some sample diamonds brought from South\nAmerica by two young prospectors who happened to be in Kimberley\nat the time. Suspicion was then bound to fall on them.\"\n\n\"Very clever,\" interpolated the Count approvingly.\n\n\"The 'Colonel' is always clever.", "Well, I did my part--but I also\ndid one thing which the 'Colonel' had not foreseen. I kept back\nsome of the South American stones--one or two are unique and could\neasily be proved never to have passed through De Beer's hands. With\nthese diamonds in my possession, I have the whip-hand of my esteemed\nchief. Once the two young men are cleared, his part in the matter\nis bound to be suspected. I have said nothing all these years, I\nhave been content to know that I had this weapon in reserve, but\nnow matters are different. I want my price--and it will be a big,\nI might almost say a staggering price.\"\n\n\"Extraordinary,\" said the Count. \"And doubtless you carry these\ndiamonds about with you everywhere?\"\n\nHis eyes roamed gently round the disordered room.\n\nNadina laughed softly. \"You need suppose nothing of the sort. I am\nnot a fool. The diamonds are in a safe place where no one will\ndream of looking for them.\"\n\n\"I never thought you a fool, my dear lady, but may I venture to\nsuggest that you are somewhat foolhardy? The 'Colonel' is not the\ntype of man to take kindly to being blackmailed, you know.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid of him,\" she laughed. \"There is only one man I\nhave ever feared--and he is dead.\"\n\nThe man looked at her curiously.\n\n\"Let us hope that he will not come to life again, then,\" he remarked\nlightly.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" cried the dancer sharply.\n\nThe Count looked slightly surprised.\n\n\"I only meant that a resurrection would be awkward for you,\" he\nexplained. \"A foolish joke.\"\n\nShe gave a sigh of relief.\n\n\"Oh, no, he is dead all right. Killed in the war. He was a man who\nonce--loved me.\"\n\n\"In South Africa?\" asked the Count negligently.\n\n\"Yes, since you ask it, in South Africa.\"\n\n\"That is your native country, is it not?\"\n\nShe nodded. Her visitor rose and reached for his hat.\n\n\"Well,\" he remarked, \"you know your own business best, but, if I\nwere you, I should fear the 'Colonel' far more than any disillusioned\nlover.", "He is a man whom it is particularly easy to--underestimate.\"\n\nShe laughed scornfully.\n\n\"As if I did not know him after all these years!\"\n\n\"I wonder if you do?\" he said softly. \"I very much wonder if you\ndo.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am not a fool! And I am not alone in this. The South African\nmail-boat docks at Southampton to-morrow, and on board her is a\nman who has come specially from Africa at my request and who has\ncarried out certain orders of mine. The 'Colonel' will have not\none of us to deal with, but two.\"\n\n\"Is that wise?\"\n\n\"It is necessary.\"\n\n\"You are sure of this man?\"\n\nA rather peculiar smile played over the dancer's face.\n\n\"I am quite sure of him. He is inefficient, but perfectly\ntrustworthy.\" She paused, and then added in an indifferent tone of\nvoice: \"As a matter of fact, he happens to be my husband.\"\n\nEverybody has been at me, right and left, to write this story from\nthe great (represented by Lord Nasby) to the small (represented by\nour late maid of all work, Emily, whom I saw when I was last in\nEngland. \"Lor', miss, what a beyewtiful book you might make out of\nit all--just like the pictures!\").\n\nI'll admit that I've certain qualifications for the task. I was\nmixed up in the affair from the very beginning, I was in the thick\nof it all through, and I was triumphantly \"in at the death.\" Very\nfortunately, too, the gaps that I cannot supply from my own\nknowledge are amply covered by Sir Eustace Pedler's diary, of which\nhe has kindly begged me to make use.\n\nSo here goes. Anne Beddingfeld starts to narrate her adventures.\n\nI'd always longed for adventures. You see, my life had such a\ndreadful sameness. My father, Professor Beddingfeld, was one of\nEngland's greatest living authorities on Primitive Man. He really\nwas a genius--every one admits that. His mind dwelt in Palaeolithic\ntimes, and the inconvenience of life for him was that his body\ninhabited the modern world. Papa did not care for modern man--even\nNeolithic Man he despised as a mere herder of cattle, and he did\nnot rise to enthusiasm until he reached the Mousterian period.", "Unfortunately one cannot entirely dispense with modern men. One is\nforced to have some kind of truck with butchers and bakers and\nmilkmen and greengrocers. Therefore, Papa being immersed in the\npast, Mamma having died when I was a baby, it fell to me to\nundertake the practical side of living. Frankly, I hate Palaeolithic\nMan, be he Aurignacian, Mousterian, Chellian, or anything else,\nand though I typed and revised most of Papa's _Neanderthal Man and\nhis Ancestors,_ Neanderthal men themselves fill me with loathing,\nand I always reflect what a fortunate circumstance it was that they\nbecame extinct in remote ages.\n\nI do not know whether Papa guessed my feelings on the subject,\nprobably not, and in any case he would not have been interested.\nThe opinion of other people never interested him in the slightest\ndegree. I think it was really a sign of his greatness. In the same\nway, he lived quite detached from the necessities of daily life.\nHe ate what was put before him in an exemplary fashion, but seemed\nmildly pained when the question of paying for it arose. We never\nseemed to have any money. His celebrity was not of the kind that\nbrought in a cash return. Although he was a fellow of almost every\nimportant society, and had rows of letters after his name, the\ngeneral public scarcely knew of his existence, and his long learned\nbooks, though adding signally to the sum-total of human knowledge,\nhad no attraction for the masses. Only on one occasion did he leap\ninto the public gaze. He had read a paper before some society on\nthe subject of the young of the chimpanzee. The young of the human\nrace show some anthropoid features, whereas the young of the\nchimpanzee approach more nearly to the human than the adult\nchimpanzee does. That seems to show that whereas our ancestors were\nmore Simian than we are, the chimpanzee's were of a higher type\nthan the present species--in other words, the chimpanzee is a\ndegenerate. That enterprising newspaper, the _Daily Budget,_ being\nhard up for something spicy, immediately brought itself out with\nlarge headlines.", "\"We are not descended from monkeys, but are\nmonkeys descended from _us?_ Eminent Professor says chimpanzees\nare decadent humans.\" Shortly afterwards a reporter called to see\nPapa, and endeavoured to induce him to write a series of popular\narticles on the theory. I have seldom seen Papa so angry. He turned\nthe reporter out of the house with scant ceremony, much to my\nsecret sorrow, as we were particularly short of money at the\nmoment. In fact, for a moment I meditated running after the young\nman and informing him that my father had changed his mind and would\nsend the articles in question. I could easily have written them\nmyself, and the probabilities were that Papa would never have\nlearnt of the transaction, not being a reader of the _Daily Budget._\nHowever, I rejected this course as being too risky, so I merely\nput on my best hat and went sadly down the village to interview\nour justly irate grocer.\n\nThe reporter from the _Daily Budget_ was the only young man who\never came to our house. There were times when I envied Emily, our\nlittle servant, who \"walked out\" whenever occasion offered with a\nlarge sailor to whom she was affianced. In between times, to \"keep\nher hand in\" as she expressed it, she walked out with the\ngreengrocer's young man, and the chemist's assistant. I reflected\nsadly that I had no one to \"keep my hand in\" with. All Papa's\nfriends were aged Professors--usually with long beards. It is true\nthat Professor Peterson once clasped me affectionately and said I\nhad a \"neat little waist\" and then tried to kiss me. The phrase\nalone dated him hopelessly. No self-respecting female has had a\n\"neat little waist\" since I was in my cradle.\n\nI yearned for adventure, for love, for romance, and I seemed\ncondemned to an existence of drab utility. The village possessed\na lending library, full of tattered works of fiction, and I enjoyed\nperils and love-making at second hand, and went to sleep dreaming\nof stern, silent Rhodesians, and of strong men who always \"felled\ntheir opponent with a single blow.\"", "There was no one in the village\nwho even looked as though he could \"fell\" an opponent, with a\nsingle blow or with several.\n\nThere was the Kinema too, with a weekly episode of \"The Perils of\nPamela.\" Pamela was a magnificent young woman. Nothing daunted her.\nShe fell out of aeroplanes, adventured in submarines, climbed\nskyscrapers and crept about in the Underworld without turning a\nhair. She was not really clever, the Master Criminal of the\nUnderworld caught her each time, but as he seemed loath to knock\nher on the head in a simple way, and always doomed her to death in\na sewer-gas chamber or by some new and marvellous means, the hero\nwas always able to rescue her at the beginning of the following\nweek's episode. I used to come out with my head in a delirious\nwhirl--and then I would get home and find a notice from the Gas\nCompany threatening to cut us off if the outstanding account was\nnot paid!\n\nAnd yet, though I did not suspect it, every moment was bringing\nadventure nearer to me.\n\nIt is possible that there are many people in the world who have\nnever heard of the finding of an antique skull at the Broken Hill\nMine in Northern Rhodesia. I came down one morning to find Papa\nexcited to the point of apoplexy. He poured out the whole story to\nme.\n\n\"You understand, Anne? There are undoubtedly certain resemblances\nto the Java skull, but superficial--superficial only. No, here we\nhave what I have always maintained--the ancestral form of the\nNeanderthal race. You grant that the Gibraltar skull is the most\nprimitive of the Neanderthal skulls found? Why? The cradle of the\nrace was in Africa. They passed to Europe----\"\n\n\"Not marmalade on kippers, papa,\" I said hastily, arresting my\nparent's absent-minded hand. \"Yes, you were saying?\"\n\n\"They passed to Europe on----\"\n\nHere he broke down with a bad fit of choking, the result of an\nimmoderate mouthful of kipper-bones.\n\n\"But we must start at once,\" he declared, as he rose to his feet\nat the conclusion of the meal.", "\"There is no time to be lost. We\nmust be on the spot--there are doubtless incalculable finds to be\nfound in the neighbourhood. I shall be interested to note whether\nthe implements are typical of the Mousterian period--there will be\nthe remains of the primitive ox, I should say, but not those of\nthe woolly rhinoceros. Yes, a little army will be starting soon.\nWe must get ahead of them. You will write to Cook's to-day, Anne?\"\n\n\"What about money, papa?\" I hinted delicately.\n\nHe turned a reproachful eye upon me.\n\n\"Your point of view always depresses me, my child. We must not be\nsordid. No, no, in the cause of science one must not be sordid.\"\n\n\"I feel Cook's might be sordid, papa.\"\n\nPapa looked pained.\n\n\"My dear Anne, you will pay them in ready money.\"\n\n\"I haven't got any ready money.\"\n\nPapa looked thoroughly exasperated.\n\n\"My child, I really cannot be bothered with these vulgar money\ndetails. The bank--I had something from the Manager yesterday,\nsaying I had twenty-seven pounds.\"\n\n\"That's your overdraft, I fancy.\"\n\n\"Ah, I have it! Write to my publishers.\"\n\nI acquiesced doubtfully, Papa's books bringing in more glory than\nmoney. I liked the idea of going to Rhodesia immensely. \"Stern\nsilent men,\" I murmured to myself in an ecstasy. Then something in\nmy parent's appearance struck me as unusual.\n\n\"You have odd boots on, papa,\" I said. \"Take off the brown one and\nput on the other black one. And don't forget your muffler. It's a\nvery cold day.\"\n\nIn a few minutes Papa stalked off, correctly booted and well\nmufflered.\n\nHe returned late that evening, and, to my dismay, I saw his muffler\nand overcoat were missing.\n\n\"Dear me, Anne, you are quite right. I took them off to go into\nthe cavern. One gets so dirty there.\"\n\nI nodded feelingly, remembering an occasion when Papa had returned\nliterally plastered from head to foot with rich Pleiocene clay.\n\nOur principal reason for settling in Little Hampsly had been the\nneighbourhood of Hampsly Cavern, a buried cave rich in deposits of\nthe Aurignacian culture.", "We had a tiny Museum in the village, and\nthe curator and Papa spent most of their days messing about\nunderground and bringing to light portions of woolly rhinoceros\nand cave bear.\n\nPapa coughed badly all the evening, and the following morning I\nsaw he had a temperature and sent for the doctor.\n\nPoor Papa, he never had a chance. It was double pneumonia. He died\nfour days later.\n\nEvery one was very kind to me. Dazed as I was, I appreciated that.\nI felt no overwhelming grief. Papa had never loved me, I knew that\nwell enough. If he had, I might have loved him in return. No, there\nhad not been love between us, but we had belonged together, and I\nhad looked after him, and had secretly admired his learning and\nhis uncompromising devotion to science. And it hurt me that Papa\nshould have died just when the interest of life was at its height\nfor him. I should have felt happier if I could have buried him in\na cave, with paintings of reindeer and flint implements, but the\nforce of public opinion constrained a neat tomb (with marble slab)\nin our hideous local churchyard. The vicar's consolations, though\nwell meant, did not console me in the least.\n\nIt took some time to dawn upon me that the thing I had always\nlonged for--freedom--was at last mine. I was an orphan, and\npractically penniless, but free. At the same time I realized the\nextraordinary kindness of all these good people. The vicar did his\nbest to persuade me that his wife was in urgent need of a companion\nhelp. Our tiny local library suddenly made up its mind to have an\nassistant librarian. Finally, the doctor called upon me, and after\nmaking various ridiculous excuses for failing to send in a proper\nbill, he hummed and hawed a good deal and suddenly suggested that\nI should marry him.\n\nI was very much astonished. The doctor was nearer forty than\nthirty, and a round, tubby little man. He was not at all like the\nhero of \"The Perils of Pamela,\" and even less like a stern and\nsilent Rhodesian.", "I reflected a minute and then asked him why he\nwanted to marry me. That seemed to fluster him a good deal, and he\nmurmured that a wife was a great help to a General Practitioner.\nThe position seemed even more unromantic than before, and yet\nsomething in me urged towards its acceptance. Safety, that was what\nI was being offered. Safety--and a Comfortable Home. Thinking it\nover now, I believe I did the little man an injustice. He was\nhonestly in love with me, but a mistaken delicacy prevented him\nfrom pressing his suit on those lines. Anyway, my love of romance\nrebelled.\n\n\"It's extremely kind of you,\" I said. \"But it's impossible. I could\nnever marry a man unless I loved him madly.\"\n\n\"You don't think----?\"\n\n\"No, I don't,\" I said firmly.\n\nHe sighed.\n\n\"But, my dear child, what do you propose to do?\"\n\n\"Have adventures and see the world,\" I replied, without the least\nhesitation.\n\n\"Miss Anne, you are very much of a child still. You don't\nunderstand----\"\n\n\"The practical difficulties? Yes, I do, doctor. I'm not a\nsentimental schoolgirl--I'm a hard-headed mercenary shrew! You'd\nknow it if you married me!\"\n\n\"I wish you would reconsider----\"\n\n\"I can't.\"\n\nHe sighed again.\n\n\"I have another proposal to make. An aunt of mine who lives in\nWales is in want of a young lady to help her. How would that suit\nyou?\"\n\n\"No, doctor, I'm going to London. If things happen anywhere, they\nhappen in London. I shall keep my eyes open and you'll see,\nsomething will turn up! You'll hear of me next in China or\nTimbuctoo.\"\n\nMy next visitor was Mr. Flemming, Papa's London solicitor. He came\ndown specially from town to see me. An ardent anthropologist\nhimself, he was a great admirer of Papa's works. He was a tall,\nspare man with a thin face and grey hair. He rose to meet me as I\nentered the room and, taking both my hands in his, patted them\naffectionately.\n\n\"My poor child,\" he said. \"My poor, poor child.\"\n\nWithout conscious hypocrisy, I found myself assuming the demeanour\nof a bereaved orphan.", "He hypnotized me into it. He was benignant,\nkind and fatherly--and without the least doubt he regarded me as a\nperfect fool of a girl left adrift to face an unkind world. From\nthe first I felt that it was quite useless to try to convince him\nof the contrary. As things turned out, perhaps it was just as well\nI didn't.\n\n\"My dear child, do you think you can listen to me whilst I try to\nmake a few things clear to you?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"Your father, as you know, was a very great man. Posterity will\nappreciate him. But he was not a good man of business.\"\n\nI knew that quite as well, if not better than Mr. Flemming, but I\nrestrained myself from saying so. He continued:\n\n\"I do not suppose you understand much of these matters. I will try\nto explain as clearly as I can.\"\n\nHe explained at unnecessary length. The upshot seemed to be that\nI was left to face life with the sum of PS87, 17s. 4d. It seemed a\nstrangely unsatisfying amount. I waited in some trepidation for\nwhat was coming next. I feared that Mr. Flemming would be sure to\nhave an aunt in Scotland who was in want of a bright young\ncompanion. Apparently, however, he hadn't.\n\n\"The question is,\" he went on, \"the future. I understand you have\nno living relatives?\"\n\n\"I'm alone in the world,\" I said, and was struck anew by my likeness\nto a film heroine.\n\n\"You have friends?\"\n\n\"Every one has been very kind to me,\" I said gratefully.\n\n\"Who would not be kind to one so young and charming?\" said Mr.\nFlemming gallantly. \"Well, well, my dear, we must see what can be\ndone.\" He hesitated a minute, and then said: \"Supposing--how would\nit be if you came to us for a time?\"\n\nI jumped at the chance. London! The place for things to happen.\n\n\"It's awfully kind of you,\" I said. \"Might I really? Just while\nI'm looking round. I must start out to earn my living, you know?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, my dear child.", "I quite understand. We will look round\nfor something--suitable.\"\n\nI felt instinctively that Mr. Flemming's ideas of \"something\nsuitable\" and mine were likely to be widely divergent, but it was\ncertainly not the moment to air my views.\n\n\"That is settled then. Why not return with me to-day?\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you, but will Mrs. Flemming----\"\n\n\"My wife will be delighted to welcome you.\"\n\nI wonder if husbands know as much about their wives as they think\nthey do. If I had a husband, I should hate him to bring home\norphans without consulting me first.\n\n\"We will send her a wire from the station,\" continued the lawyer.\n\nMy few personal belongings were soon packed. I contemplated my hat\nsadly before putting it on. It had originally been what I call a\n\"Mary\" hat, meaning by that the kind of hat a housemaid ought to\nwear on her day out--but doesn't! A limp thing of black straw with\na suitably depressed brim. With the inspiration of genius, I had\nkicked it once, punched it twice, dented in the crown and affixed\nto it a thing like a cubist's dream of a jazz carrot. The result\nhad been distinctly chic. The carrot I had already removed, of\ncourse, and now I proceeded to undo the rest of my handiwork. The\n\"Mary\" hat resumed its former status with an additional battered\nappearance which made it even more depressing than formerly. I\nmight as well look as much like the popular conception of an orphan\nas possible. I was just a shade nervous of Mrs. Flemming's\nreception, but hoped my appearance might have a sufficiently\ndisarming effect.\n\nMr. Flemming was nervous too. I realized that as we went up the\nstairs of the tall house in a quiet Kensington Square. Mrs. Flemming\ngreeted me pleasantly enough. She was a stout, placid woman of the\n\"good wife and mother\" type. She took me up to a spotless\nchintz-hung bedroom, hoped I had everything I wanted, informed me\nthat tea would be ready in about a quarter of an hour, and left me\nto my own devices.", "I heard her voice, slightly raised, as she entered the drawing-room\nbelow on the first floor.\n\n\"Well, Henry, why on earth----\" I lost the rest, but the acerbity of\nthe tone was evident. And a few minutes later another phrase\nfloated up to me, in an even more acid voice:\n\n\"I agree with you! She is certainly _very_ good-looking.\"\n\nIt is really a very hard life. Men will not be nice to you if you\nare not good-looking, and women will not be nice to you if you are.\n\nWith a deep sigh I proceeded to do things to my hair. I have nice\nhair. It is black--a real black, not dark brown, and it grows well\nback from my forehead and down over the ears. With a ruthless hand\nI dragged it upwards. As ears, my ears are quite all right, but\nthere is no doubt about it, ears are _demode_ nowadays. They are\nlike the \"Queen of Spain's legs\" in Professor Peterson's young day.\nWhen I had finished I looked almost unbelievably like the kind of\norphan that walks out in a queue with a little bonnet and a red\ncloak.\n\nI noticed when I went down that Mrs. Flemming's eyes rested on my\nexposed ears with quite a kindly glance. Mr. Flemming seemed\npuzzled. I had no doubt that he was saying to himself, \"What _has_\nthe child done to herself?\"\n\nOn the whole the rest of the day passed off well. It was settled\nthat I was to start at once to look for something to do.\n\nWhen I went to bed, I stared earnestly at my face in the glass.\nWas I really good-looking? Honestly, I couldn't say I thought so!\nI hadn't got a straight Grecian nose, or a rosebud mouth, or any\nof the things you ought to have. It is true that a curate once told\nme that my eyes were like \"imprisoned sunshine in a dark, dark\nwood\"--but curates always know so many quotations, and fire them\noff at random. I'd much prefer to have Irish blue eyes than dark\ngreen ones with yellow flecks!", "Still, green is a good colour for\nadventuresses.\n\nI wound a black garment tightly round me, leaving my arms and\nshoulders bare. Then I brushed back my hair and pulled it well down\nover my ears again. I put a lot of powder on my face, so that the\nskin seemed even whiter than usual. I fished about until I found\nsome old lip-salve, and I put oceans of it on my lips. Then I did\nunder my eyes with burnt cork. Finally, I draped a red ribbon over\nmy bare shoulder, stuck a scarlet feather in my hair, and placed\na cigarette in one corner of my mouth. The whole effect pleased me\nvery much.\n\n\"Anna the Adventuress,\" I said aloud, nodding at my reflection.\n\"Anna the Adventuress. Episode I, 'The House in Kensington'!\"\n\nGirls are foolish things.\n\nIn the succeeding weeks I was a good deal bored.\n\nMrs. Flemming and her friends seemed to me to be supremely\nuninteresting. They talked for hours of themselves and their\nchildren and of the difficulties of getting good milk for the\nchildren and of what they said to the Dairy when the milk wasn't\ngood. Then they would go on to servants, and the difficulties of\ngetting good servants and of what they had said to the woman at\nthe Registry Office and of what the woman at the Registry Office\nhad said to them. They never seemed to read the papers or to care\nabout what went on in the world. They disliked travelling--everything\nwas so different to England. The Riviera was all right, of course,\nbecause one met all one's friends there.\n\nI listened and contained myself with difficulty. Most of these\nwomen were rich. The whole wide beautiful world was theirs to\nwander in and they deliberately stayed in dirty dull London and\ntalked about milkmen and servants! I think now, looking back, that\nI was perhaps a shade intolerant. But they _were_ stupid--stupid\neven at their chosen job: most of them kept the most extraordinarily\ninadequate and muddled housekeeping accounts.\n\nMy affairs did not progress very fast.", "The house and furniture had\nbeen sold, and the amount realized had just covered our debts. As\nyet, I had not been successful in finding a post. Not that I really\nwanted one! I had the firm conviction that, if I went about looking\nfor adventure, adventure would meet me halfway. It is a theory of\nmine that one always gets what one wants. My theory was about to\nbe proved in practice.\n\nIt was early in January--the 8th, to be exact. I was returning from\nan unsuccessful interview with a lady who said she wanted a\nsecretary-companion, but really seemed to require a strong charwoman\nwho would work twelve hours a day for PS25 a year. Having parted\nwith mutual veiled impolitenesses, I walked down Edgware Road (the\ninterview had taken place in a house in St. John's Wood) and across\nHyde Park to St. George's Hospital. There I entered Hyde Park\nCorner Tube Station and took a ticket to Gloucester Road.\n\nOnce on the platform I walked to the extreme end of it. My inquiring\nmind wished to satisfy itself as to whether there really _were_\npoints and an opening between the two tunnels just beyond the\nstation in the direction of Down Street. I was foolishly pleased\nto find I was right. There were not many people on the platform,\nand at the extreme end there was only myself and one man. As I\npassed him, I sniffed dubiously. If there is one smell I cannot\nbear it is that of moth balls! This man's heavy overcoat simply\nreeked of them. And yet most men begin to wear their winter\novercoats before January, and consequently by this time the smell\nought to have worn off. The man was beyond me, standing close to\nthe edge of the tunnel. He seemed lost in thought, and I was able\nto stare at him without rudeness. He was a small thin man, very\nbrown of face, with light blue eyes and a small dark beard.\n\n\"Just come from abroad,\" I deduced. \"That's why his overcoat smells\nso. He's come from India.", "Not an officer, or he wouldn't have a\nbeard. Perhaps a tea-planter.\"\n\nAt this moment the man turned as though to retrace his steps along\nthe platform. He glanced at me and then his eyes went on to\nsomething behind me, and his face changed. It was distorted by\nfear--almost panic. He stood a step backwards as though involuntarily\nrecoiling from some danger, forgetting that he was standing on the\nextreme edge of the platform, and went down and over.\n\nThere was a vivid flash from the rails and a crackling sound. I\nshrieked. People came running up. Two station officials seemed to\nmaterialize from nowhere and took command.\n\nI remained where I was, rooted to the spot by a sort of horrible\nfascination. Part of me was appalled at the sudden disaster, and\nanother part of me was coolly and dispassionately interested in\nthe methods employed for lifting the man off the live rail and back\nonto the platform.\n\n\"Let me pass, please. I am a medical man.\"\n\nA tall man with a brown beard pressed past me and bent over the\nmotionless body.\n\nAs he examined it, a curious sense of unreality seemed to possess\nme. The thing wasn't real--couldn't be. Finally, the doctor stood\nupright and shook his head.\n\n\"Dead as a door-nail. Nothing to be done.\"\n\nWe had all crowded nearer, and an aggrieved porter raised his\nvoice.\n\n\"Now then, stand back there, will you? What's the sense in crowding\nround.\"\n\nA sudden nausea seized me, and I turned blindly and ran up the\nstairs again towards the lift. I felt that it was too horrible. I\nmust get out into the open air. The doctor who had examined the\nbody was just ahead of me. The lift was just about to go up,\nanother having descended, and he broke into a run. As he did so,\nhe dropped a piece of paper.\n\nI stopped, picked it up, and ran after him. But the lift gates\nclanged in my face, and I was left holding the paper in my hand.\nBy the time the second lift reached the street level, there was no\nsign of my quarry.", "I hoped it was nothing important that he had\nlost, and for the first time I examined it.\n\nIt was a plain half-sheet of notepaper with some figures and words\nscrawled upon it in pencil. This is a facsimile of it:\n\n[Indistinct cursive script which appears to say something like:\n \"1 7 . 1 2 2 Kilmorden Castle\"]\n\nOn the face of it, it certainly did not appear to be of any\nimportance. Still, I hesitated to throw it away. As I stood there\nholding it, I involuntarily wrinkled my nose in displeasure. Moth\nballs again! I held the paper gingerly to my nose. Yes, it smelt\nstrongly of them. But, then----\n\nI folded up the paper carefully and put it in my bag. I walked home\nslowly and did a good deal of thinking.\n\nI explained to Mrs. Flemming that I had witnessed a nasty accident\nin the Tube and that I was rather upset and would go to my room\nand lie down. The kind woman insisted on my having a cup of tea.\nAfter that I was left to my own devices, and I proceeded to carry\nout a plan I had formed coming home. I wanted to know what it was\nthat had produced that curious feeling of unreality whilst I was\nwatching the doctor examine the body. First I lay down on the floor\nin the attitude of the corpse, then I laid a bolster down in my\nstead, and proceeded to duplicate, so far as I could remember,\nevery motion and gesture of the doctor. When I had finished I had\ngot what I wanted. I sat back on my heels and frowned at the\nopposite walls.\n\nThere was a brief notice in the evening papers that a man had been\nkilled in the Tube, and a doubt was expressed whether it was\nsuicide or accident. That seemed to me to make my duty clear, and\nwhen Mr. Flemming heard my story he quite agreed with me.\n\n\"Undoubtedly you will be wanted at the inquest. You say no one else\nwas near enough to see what happened?\"\n\n\"I had the feeling some one was coming up behind me, but I can't\nbe sure--and, anyway, they wouldn't be as near as I was.\"", "The inquest was held. Mr. Flemming made all the arrangements and\ntook me there with him. He seemed to fear that it would be a great\nordeal to me, and I had to conceal from him my complete composure.\n\nThe deceased had been identified as L. B. Carton. Nothing had been\nfound in his pockets except a house-agent's order to view a house\non the river near Marlow. It was in the name of L. B. Carton,\nRussell Hotel. The bureau clerk from the hotel identified the man\nas having arrived the day before and booked a room under that name.\nHe had registered as L. B. Carton, Kimberley, S. Africa. He had\nevidently come straight off the steamer.\n\nI was the only person who had seen anything of the affair.\n\n\"You think it was an accident?\" the coroner asked me.\n\n\"I am positive of it. Something alarmed him, and he stepped\nbackwards blindly without thinking what he was doing.\"\n\n\"But what could have alarmed him?\"\n\n\"That I don't know. But there was something. He looked\npanic-stricken.\"\n\nA stolid juryman suggested that some men were terrified of cats.\nThe man might have seen a cat. I didn't think his suggestion a very\nbrilliant one, but it seemed to pass muster with the jury, who were\nobviously impatient to get home and only too pleased at being able\nto give a verdict of accident as opposed to suicide.\n\n\"It is extraordinary to me,\" said the coroner, \"that the doctor\nwho first examined the body has not come forward. His name and\naddress should have been taken at the time. It was most irregular\nnot to do so.\"\n\nI smiled to myself. I had my own theory in regard to the doctor.\nIn pursuance of it, I determined to make a call upon Scotland Yard\nat an early date.\n\nBut the next morning brought a surprise. The Flemmings took in the\n_Daily Budget,_ and the _Daily Budget_ was having a day after its\nown heart.\n\nEXTRAORDINARY SEQUEL TO TUBE ACCIDENT.\n\nWOMAN FOUND STABBED IN LONELY HOUSE.\n\nI read eagerly.\n\n\"A sensational discovery was made yesterday at the Mill House,\nMarlow.", "The Mill House, which is the property of Sir Eustace\nPedler, M.P., is to be let unfurnished, and an order to view this\nproperty was found in the pocket of the man who was at first\nthought to have committed suicide by throwing himself on the live\nrail at Hyde Park Corner Tube Station. In an upper room of the Mill\nHouse the body of a beautiful young woman was discovered yesterday,\nstrangled. She is thought to be a foreigner, but so far has not\nbeen identified. The police are reported to have a clue. Sir\nEustace Pedler, the owner of the Mill House, is wintering on the\nRiviera.\"\n\nNobody came forward to identify the dead woman. The inquest elicited\nthe following facts.\n\nShortly after one o'clock on January 8th, a well-dressed woman with\na slight foreign accent had entered the offices of Messrs. Butler\nand Park, house-agents, in Knightsbridge. She explained that she\nwanted to rent or purchase a house on the Thames within easy reach\nof London. The particulars of several were given to her, including\nthose of the Mill House. She gave the name of Mrs. de Castina and\nher address as the Ritz, but there proved to be no one of that name\nstaying there, and the hotel people failed to identify the body.\n\nMrs. James, the wife of Sir Eustace Pedler's gardener, who acted\nas caretaker to the Mill House and inhabited the small lodge\nopening on the main road, gave evidence. About three o'clock that\nafternoon, a lady came to see over the house. She produced an order\nfrom the house-agents, and, as was the usual custom, Mrs. James\ngave her the keys of the house. It was situated at some distance\nfrom the lodge, and she was not in the habit of accompanying\nprospective tenants. A few minutes later a young man arrived. Mrs.\nJames described him as tall and broad-shouldered, with a bronzed\nface and light grey eyes. He was clean-shaven and was wearing a\nbrown suit. He explained to Mrs. James that he was a friend of the\nlady who had come to look over the house, but had stopped at the\npost office to send a telegram.", "She directed him to the house, and\nthought no more about the matter.\n\nFive minutes later he reappeared, handed her back the keys and\nexplained that he feared the house would not suit them. Mrs. James\ndid not see the lady, but thought that she had gone on ahead. What\nshe did notice was that the young man seemed very much upset about\nsomething. \"He looked like a man who'd seen a ghost. I thought he\nwas taken ill.\"\n\nOn the following day another lady and gentleman came to see the\nproperty and discovered the body lying on the floor in one of the\nupstairs rooms. Mrs. James identified it as that of the lady who\nhad come the day before. The house-agents also recognized it as\nthat of \"Mrs. de Castina.\" The police surgeon gave it as his\nopinion that the woman had been dead about twenty-four hours. The\n_Daily Budget_ had jumped to the conclusion that the man in the\nTube had murdered the woman and afterwards committed suicide.\nHowever, as the Tube victim was dead at two o'clock, and the woman\nwas alive and well at three o'clock, the only logical conclusion\nto come to was that the two occurrences had nothing to do with each\nother, and that the order to view the house at Marlow found in the\ndead man's pocket was merely one of those coincidences which so\noften occur in this life.\n\nA verdict of \"Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown\"\nwas returned, and the police (and the _Daily Budget_) were left to\nlook for \"the man in the brown suit.\" Since Mrs. James was positive\nthat there was no one in the house when the lady entered it, and\nthat nobody except the young man in question entered it until the\nfollowing afternoon, it seemed only logical to conclude that he\nwas the murderer of the unfortunate Mrs. de Castina. She had been\nstrangled with a piece of stout black cord, and had evidently been\ncaught unawares with no time to cry out. The black silk handbag\nwhich she carried contained a well-filled notecase and some loose\nchange, a fine lace handkerchief, unmarked, and the return half of\na first-class ticket to London.", "Nothing much there to go upon.\n\nSuch were the details published broadcast by the _Daily Budget,_\nand \"Find the Man in the Brown Suit\" was their daily war-cry. On\nan average about five hundred people wrote daily to announce their\nsuccess in the quest, and tall young men with well-tanned faces\ncursed the day when their tailors had persuaded them to a brown\nsuit. The accident in the Tube, dismissed as a coincidence, faded\nout of the public mind.\n\nWas it a coincidence? I was not so sure. No doubt I was\nprejudiced--the Tube incident was my own pet mystery--but there\ncertainly seemed to me to be a connection of some kind between the\ntwo fatalities. In each there was a man with a tanned face--evidently\nan Englishman living abroad, and there were other things. It was\nthe consideration of these other things that finally impelled me\nto what I considered a dashing step. I presented myself at Scotland\nYard and demanded to see whoever was in charge of the Mill House\ncase.\n\nMy request took some time to understand, as I had inadvertently\nselected the department for lost umbrellas, but eventually I was\nushered into a small room and presented to Detective Inspector\nMeadows.\n\nInspector Meadows was a small man with a ginger head and what I\nconsidered a peculiarly irritating manner. A satellite, also in\nplain clothes, sat unobtrusively in a corner.\n\n\"Good morning,\" I said nervously.\n\n\"Good morning. Will you take a seat? I understand you've something\nto tell me that you think may be of use to us.\"\n\nHis tone seemed to indicate that such a thing was unlikely in the\nextreme. I felt my temper stirred.\n\n\"Of course you know about the man who was killed in the Tube? The\nman who had an order to view this same house at Marlow in his\npocket.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the inspector. \"You are the Miss Beddingfeld who gave\nevidence at the inquest. Certainly the man had an order in his\npocket. A lot of other people may have had too--only they didn't\nhappen to be killed.\"", "I rallied my forces.\n\n\"You don't think it odd that this man had no ticket in his pocket?\"\n\n\"Easiest thing in the world to drop your ticket. Done it myself.\"\n\n\"And no money.\"\n\n\"He had some loose change in his trousers pocket.\"\n\n\"But no notecase.\"\n\n\"Some men don't carry a pocket-book or notecase of any kind.\"\n\nI tried another tack.\n\n\"You don't think it's odd that the doctor never came forward\nafterwards?\"\n\n\"A busy medical man very often doesn't read the papers. He probably\nforgot all about the accident.\"\n\n\"In fact, inspector, you are determined to find nothing odd,\" I\nsaid sweetly.\n\n\"Well, I'm inclined to think you're a little too fond of the word,\nMiss Beddingfeld. Young ladies are romantic, I know--fond of\nmysteries and such-like. But as I'm a busy man----\"\n\nI took the hint and rose.\n\nThe man in the corner raised a meek voice.\n\n\"Perhaps the young lady would tell us briefly what her ideas really\nare on the subject, inspector?\"\n\nThe inspector fell in with the suggestion readily enough.\n\n\"Yes, come now, Miss Beddingfeld, don't be offended. You've asked\nquestions and hinted things. Just say straight out what it is\nyou've got in your head.\"\n\nI wavered between injured dignity and the overwhelming desire to\nexpress my theories. Injured dignity went to the wall.\n\n\"You said at the inquest you were positive it wasn't suicide?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm quite certain of that. The man was frightened. What\nfrightened him? It wasn't me. But some one might have been walking\nup the platform towards us--some one he recognized.\"\n\n\"You didn't see any one?\"\n\n\"No,\" I admitted. \"I didn't turn my head. Then, as soon as the body\nwas recovered from the line, a man pushed forward to examine it,\nsaying he was a doctor.\"\n\n\"Nothing unusual in that,\" said the inspector dryly.\n\n\"But he wasn't a doctor.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"He wasn't a doctor,\" I repeated.\n\n\"How do you know that, Miss Beddingfeld?\"\n\n\"It's difficult to say, exactly. I've worked in Hospital during\nthe war, and I've seen doctors handle bodies. There's a sort of\ndeft professional callousness that this man hadn't got.", "Besides,\na doctor doesn't usually feel for the heart on the right side of\nthe body.\"\n\n\"He did that?\"\n\n\"Yes, I didn't notice it specially at the time--except that I felt\nthere was something wrong. But I worked it out when I got home,\nand then I saw why the whole thing had looked so unhandy to me at\nthe time.\"\n\n\"H'm,\" said the inspector. He was reaching slowly for pen and\npaper.\n\n\"In running his hands over the upper part of the man's body he\nwould have ample opportunity to take anything he wanted from the\npockets.\"\n\n\"Doesn't sound likely to me,\" said the inspector. \"But--well, can\nyou describe him at all?\"\n\n\"He was tall and broad-shouldered, wore a dark overcoat and black\nboots, a bowler hat. He had a dark pointed beard and gold-rimmed\neyeglasses.\"\n\n\"Take away the overcoat, the beard and the eyeglasses, and there\nwouldn't be much to know him by,\" grumbled the inspector. \"He could\nalter his appearance easy enough in five minutes if he wanted\nto--which he would do if he's the swell pickpocket you suggest.\"\n\nI had not intended to suggest anything of the kind. But from this\nmoment I gave the inspector up as hopeless.\n\n\"Nothing more you can tell us about him?\" he demanded, as I rose\nto depart.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. I seized my opportunity to fire a parting shot. \"His\nhead was markedly brachycephalic. He will not find it so easy to\nalter that.\"\n\nI observed with pleasure that Inspector Meadow's pen wavered. It\nwas clear that he did not know how to spell brachycephalic.\n\nIn the first heat of indignation I found my next step unexpectedly\neasy to tackle. I had had a half-formed plan in my head when I went\ninto Scotland Yard. One to be carried out if my interview there\nwas unsatisfactory (it had been profoundly unsatisfactory). That\nis, if I had the nerve to go through with it.\n\nThings that one would shrink from attempting normally are easily\ntackled in a flush of anger. Without giving myself time to reflect,\nI walked straight to the house of Lord Nasby.", "Lord Nasby was the millionaire owner of the _Daily Budget._ He\nowned other papers--several of them, but the _Daily Budget_ was his\nspecial child. It was as the owner of the _Daily Budget_ that he\nwas known to every householder in the United Kingdom. Owing to the\nfact that an itinerary of the great man's daily proceedings had\njust been published, I knew exactly where to find him at this\nmoment. It was his hour for dictating to his secretary in his own\nhouse.\n\nI did not, of course, suppose that any young woman who chose to\ncome and ask for him would be at once admitted to the august\npresence. But I had attended to that side of the matter. In the\ncard-tray in the hall of the Flemmings' house I had observed the\ncard of the Marquis of Loamsley, England's most famous sporting\npeer. I had removed the card, cleaned it carefully with bread-crumbs,\nand pencilled upon it the words: \"Please give Miss Beddingfeld a\nfew moments of your time.\" Adventuresses must not be too scrupulous\nin their methods.\n\nThe thing worked. A powdered footman received the card and bore it\naway. Presently a pale secretary appeared. I fenced with him\nsuccessfully. He retired defeated. He again reappeared and begged\nme to follow him. I did so. I entered a large room, a\nfrightened-looking shorthand-typist fled past me like a visitant\nfrom the spirit-world. Then the door shut and I was face to face\nwith Lord Nasby.\n\nA big man. Big head. Big face. Big moustache. Big stomach. I pulled\nmyself together. I had not come here to comment on Lord Nasby's\nstomach. He was already roaring at me.\n\n\"Well, what is it? What does Loamsley want? You his secretary?\nWhat's it all about?\"\n\n\"To begin with,\" I said with as great an appearance of coolness as\nI could manage, \"I don't know Lord Loamsley, and he certainly knows\nnothing about me. I took his card from the tray in the house of\nthe people I'm staying with, and I wrote those words on it myself.", "It was important that I should see you.\"\n\nFor a moment it appeared to be a toss up as to whether Lord Nasby\nhad apoplexy or not. In the end, he swallowed twice and got over\nit.\n\n\"I admire your coolness, young woman. Well, you see me! If you\ninterest me, you will continue to see me for exactly two minutes\nlonger.\"\n\n\"That will be ample,\" I replied. \"And I shall interest you. It's\nthe Mill House Mystery.\"\n\n\"If you've found 'The Man in the Brown Suit,' write to the Editor,\"\nhe interrupted hastily.\n\n\"If you will interrupt, I shall be more than two minutes,\" I said\nsternly. \"I haven't found 'The Man in the Brown Suit,' but I'm\nquite likely to do so.\"\n\nIn as few words as possible I put the facts of the Tube accident\nand the conclusions I had drawn from them before him. When I had\nfinished he said unexpectedly:\n\n\"What do you know of brachycephalic heads?\"\n\nI mentioned Papa.\n\n\"The Monkey man? Eh? Well, you seem to have a head of some kind\nupon your own shoulders, young woman. But it's all pretty thin,\nyou know. Not much to go upon. And no use to us--as it stands.\"\n\n\"I'm perfectly aware of that.\"\n\n\"What d'you want, then?\"\n\n\"I want a job on your paper to investigate this matter.\"\n\n\"Can't do that. We've got our own special man on it.\"\n\n\"And I've got my own special knowledge.\"\n\n\"What you've just told me, eh?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Lord Nasby. I've still got something up my sleeve.\"\n\n\"Oh, you have, have you? You seem a bright sort of girl. Well, what\nis it?\"\n\n\"When this so-called doctor got into the lift, he dropped a piece\nof paper. I picked it up. It smelt of moth balls. So did the dead\nman. The doctor didn't. So I saw at once that the doctor must have\ntaken it off the body. It had two words written on it and some\nfigures.\"\n\n\"Let's see it.\"\n\nLord Nasby stretched out a careless hand.\n\n\"I think not,\" I said, smiling. \"It's my find, you see.\"", "\"I'm right. You _are_ a bright girl. Quite right to hang on to it.\nNo scruples about not handing it over to the police?\"\n\n\"I went there to do so this morning. They persisted in regarding\nthe whole thing as having nothing to do with the Marlow affair, so\nI thought that in the circumstances I was justified in retaining\nthe paper. Besides, the inspector put my back up.\"\n\n\"Short-sighted man. Well, my dear girl, here's all I can do for\nyou. Go on working on this line of yours. If you get\nanything--anything that's publishable--send it along and you shall\nhave your chance. There's always room for real talent on the\n_Daily Budget._ But you've got to make good first. See?\"\n\nI thanked him, and apologized for my methods.\n\n\"Don't mention it. I rather like cheek--from a pretty girl. By the\nway, you said two minutes and you've been three, allowing for\ninterruptions. For a woman, that's quite remarkable! Must be your\nscientific training.\"\n\nI was in the street again, breathing hard as though I had been\nrunning. I found Lord Nasby rather wearing as a new acquaintance.\n\nI went home with a feeling of exultation. My scheme had succeeded\nfar better than I could possibly have hoped. Lord Nasby had been\npositively genial. It only now remained for me to \"Make good,\" as\nhe expressed it. Once locked in my own room, I took out my precious\npiece of paper and studied it attentively. Here was the clue to\nthe mystery.\n\nTo begin with, what did the figures represent? There were five of\nthem, and a dot after the first two. \"Seventeen--one hundred and\ntwenty-two,\" I murmured.\n\nThat did not seem to lead to anything.\n\nNext I added them up. That is often done in works of fiction and\nleads to surprising deductions.\n\n\"One and seven make eight and one is nine and two are eleven and\ntwo are thirteen.\"\n\nThirteen! Fateful number! Was this a warning to me to leave the\nwhole thing alone? Very possibly. Anyway, except as a warning, it\nseemed to be singularly useless.", "I declined to believe that any\nconspirator would take that way of writing thirteen in real life.\nIf he meant thirteen, he would write thirteen. \"13\"--like that.\n\nThere was a space between the one and the two. I accordingly\nsubtracted twenty-two from a hundred and seventy-one. The result\nwas a hundred and fifty-nine. I did it again and made it a hundred\nand forty-nine. These arithmetical exercises were doubtless\nexcellent practice, but as regarded the solution of the mystery,\nthey seemed totally ineffectual. I left arithmetic alone, not\nattempting fancy division or multiplication, and went on to the\nwords.\n\nKilmorden Castle. That was something definite. A place. Probably\nthe cradle of an aristocratic family. (Missing heir? Claimant to\ntitle?) Or possibly a picturesque ruin. (Buried treasure?)\n\nYes, on the whole I inclined to the theory of buried treasure.\nFigures always go with buried treasure. One pace to the right,\nseven paces to the left, dig one foot, descend twenty-two steps.\nThat sort of idea. I could work out that later. The thing was to\nget to Kilmorden Castle as quickly as possible.\n\nI made a strategic sally from my room and returned laden with books\nof reference. _Who's Who_, Whitaker, a Gazetteer, a History of\nScotch Ancestral Homes, and Somebody or other's British Isles.\n\nTime passed. I searched diligently, but with growing annoyance.\nFinally, I shut the last book with a bang. There appeared to be no\nsuch place as Kilmorden Castle. Here was an unexpected check. There\n_must_ be such a place. Why should any one invent a name like that\nand write it down on a piece of paper? Absurd!\n\nAnother idea occurred to me. Possibly it was a castellated\nabomination in the suburbs with a high-sounding name invented by\nits owner. But if so, it was going to be extraordinarily hard to\nfind. I sat back gloomily on my heels (I always sit on the floor\nto do anything really important) and wondered how on earth I was\nto set about it.\n\nWas there any other line I could follow? I reflected earnestly and\nthen sprang to my feet delightedly.", "Of course! I must visit the\n\"scene of the crime.\" Always done by the best sleuths! And no\nmatter how long afterwards it may be, they always find something\nthat the police have overlooked. My course was clear. I must go to\nMarlow.\n\nBut how was I to get into the house? I discarded several adventurous\nmethods, and plumped for stern simplicity. The house had been to\nlet--presumably was still to let. I would be a prospective tenant.\n\nI also decided on attacking the local house-agents, as having fewer\nhouses on their books.\n\nHere, however, I reckoned without my host. A pleasant clerk produced\nparticulars of about half a dozen desirable properties. It took\nall my ingenuity to find objections to them. In the end I feared\nI had drawn a blank.\n\n\"And you've really nothing else?\" I asked, gazing pathetically into\nthe clerk's eyes. \"Something right on the river, and with a fair\namount of garden and a small lodge,\" I added, summing up the main\npoints of the Mill House, as I had gathered them from the papers.\n\n\"Well, of course there's Sir Eustace Pedler's place,\" said the man\ndoubtfully. \"The Mill House, you know.\"\n\n\"Not--not where----\" I faltered. (Really, faltering is getting to be\nmy strong point.)\n\n\"That's it! Where the murder took place. But perhaps you wouldn't\nlike----\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't think I should mind,\" I said with an appearance of\nrallying. I felt my _bona fides_ was now quite established. \"And\nperhaps I might get it cheap--in the circumstances.\"\n\nA master touch that, I thought.\n\n\"Well, it's possible. There's no pretending that it will be easy\nto let now--servants and all that, you know. If you like the place\nafter you've seen it, I should advise you to make an offer. Shall\nI write you out an order?\"\n\n\"If you please.\"\n\nA quarter of an hour later I was at the lodge of the Mill House.\nIn answer to my knock, the door flew open and a tall middle-aged\nwoman literally bounced out.\n\n\"Nobody can go into the house, do you hear that?", "Fairly sick of\nyou reporters, I am. Sir Eustace's orders are----\"\n\n\"I understood the house was to let,\" I said freezingly, holding\nout my order. \"Of course, if it's already taken----\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure I beg your pardon, miss. I've been fairly pestered\nwith these newspaper people. Not a minute's peace. No, the house\nisn't let--nor likely to be now.\"\n\n\"Are the drains wrong?\" I asked in an anxious whisper.\n\n\"Oh, Lord, miss, the _drains_ is all right! But surely you've heard\nabout that foreign lady as was done to death here?\"\n\n\"I believe I did read something about it in the papers,\" I said\ncarelessly.\n\nMy indifference piqued the good woman. If I had betrayed any\ninterest, she would probably have closed up like an oyster. As it\nwas, she positively bridled.\n\n\"I should say you did, miss! It's been in all the newspapers. The\n_Daily Budget's_ out still to catch the man who did it. It seems,\naccording to them, as our police are no good at all. Well, I hope\nthey'll get him--although a nice-looking young fellow he was and no\nmistake. A kind of soldierly look about him--ah, well, I dare say\nhe'd been wounded in the war, and sometimes they go a bit queer\nafterwards, my sister's boy did. Perhaps she'd used him bad--they're\na bad lot, those foreigners. Though she was a fine-looking woman.\nStood there where you're standing now.\"\n\n\"Was she dark or fair?\" I ventured. \"You can't tell from these\nnewspaper portraits.\"\n\n\"Dark hair, and a very white face--too white for nature, I thought,\nand her lips reddened something cruel. I don't like to see it--a\nlittle powder now and then is quite another thing.\"\n\nWe were conversing like old friends now. I put another question.\n\n\"Did she seem nervous or upset at all?\"\n\n\"Not a bit. She was smiling to herself, quiet like, as though she\nwas amused at something. That's why you could have knocked me down\nwith a feather when, the next afternoon, those people came running\nout calling for the police and saying there'd been murder done.", "I\nshall never get over it, and as for setting foot in that house\nafter dark I wouldn't do it, not if it was ever so. Why, I wouldn't\neven stay here at the lodge, if Sir Eustace hadn't been down on\nhis bended knees to me.\"\n\n\"I thought Sir Eustace Pedler was at Cannes?\"\n\n\"So he was, miss. He come back to England when he heard the news,\nand, as to the bended knees, that was a figure of speech, his\nsecretary, Mr. Pagett, having offered us double pay to stay on,\nand, as my John says, money is money nowadays.\"\n\nI concurred heartily with John's by no means original remarks.\n\n\"The young man now,\" said Mrs. James, reverting suddenly to a\nformer point in the conversation. \"He was upset. His eyes, light\neyes, they were, I noticed them particular, was all shining.\nExcited, _I_ thought. But I never dreamt of anything being wrong.\nNot even when he came out again looking all queer.\"\n\n\"How long was he in the house?\"\n\n\"Oh, not long, a matter of five minutes maybe.\"\n\n\"How tall was he, do you think? About six foot?\"\n\n\"I should say so maybe.\"\n\n\"He was clean-shaven, you say?\"\n\n\"Yes, miss--not even one of these toothbrush moustaches.\"\n\n\"Was his chin at all shiny?\" I asked on a sudden impulse.\n\nMrs. James stared at me with awe.\n\n\"Well, now you come to mention it, miss, it _was._ However did you\nknow?\"\n\n\"It's a curious thing, but murderers often have shiny chins,\" I\nexplained wildly.\n\nMrs. James accepted the statement in all good faith.\n\n\"Really, now, miss. I never heard that before.\"\n\n\"You didn't notice what kind of a head he had, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Just the ordinary kind, miss. I'll fetch you the keys, shall I?\"\n\nI accepted them, and went on my way to the Mill House. My\nreconstructions so far I considered good. All along I had realized\nthat the differences between the man Mrs. James had described and\nmy Tube \"doctor\" were those of non-essentials. An overcoat, a\nbeard, gold-rimmed eyeglasses. The \"doctor\" had appeared middle-aged,\nbut I remembered that he had stooped over the body like a\ncomparatively young man.", "There had been a suppleness which told of\nyoung joints.\n\nThe victim of the accident (the Moth Ball man, as I called him to\nmyself) and the foreign woman, Mrs. de Castina, or whatever her\nreal name was, had had an assignation to meet at the Mill House.\nThat was how I pieced the thing together. Either because they\nfeared they were being watched or for some other reason, they chose\nthe rather ingenious method of both getting an order to view the\nsame house. Thus their meeting there might have the appearance of\npure chance.\n\nThat the Moth Ball man had suddenly caught sight of the \"doctor,\"\nand that the meeting was totally unexpected and alarming to him,\nwas another fact of which I was fairly sure. What had happened\nnext? The \"doctor\" had removed his disguise and followed the woman\nto Marlow. But it was possible that had he removed it rather\nhastily traces of spirit-gum might still linger on his chin. Hence\nmy question to Mrs. James.\n\nWhilst occupied with my thoughts I had arrived at the low\nold-fashioned door of the Mill House. Unlocking it with the key,\nI passed inside. The hall was low and dark, the place smelt forlorn\nand mildewy. In spite of myself, I shivered. Did the woman who had\ncome here \"smiling to herself\" a few days ago feel no chill of\npremonition as she entered this house? I wondered. Did the smile\nfade from her lips, and did a nameless dread close round her heart?\nOr had she gone upstairs, smiling still, unconscious of the doom\nthat was so soon to overtake her? My heart beat a little faster.\nWas the house really empty? Was doom waiting for me in it also?\nFor the first time, I understood the meaning of the much-used word,\n\"atmosphere.\" There was an atmosphere in this house, an atmosphere\nof cruelty, of menace, of evil.\n\nShaking off the feelings that oppressed me, I went quickly upstairs.\nI had no difficulty in finding the room of the tragedy. On the day\nthe body was discovered it had rained heavily, and large muddy\nboots had trampled the uncarpeted floor in every direction.", "I\nwondered if the murderer had left any footmarks the previous day.\nIt was likely that the police would be reticent on the subject if\nhe had, but on consideration I decided it was unlikely. The weather\nhad been fine and dry.\n\nThere was nothing of interest about the room. It was almost square\nwith two big bay windows, plain white walls and a bare floor, the\nboards being stained round the edges where the carpet had ceased.\nI searched it carefully, but there was not so much as a pin lying\nabout. The gifted young detective did not seem likely to discover\na neglected clue.\n\nI had brought with me a pencil and notebook. There did not seem\nmuch to note, but I duly dotted down a brief sketch of the room to\ncover my disappointment at the failure of my quest. As I was in\nthe act of returning the pencil to my bag, it slipped from my\nfingers and rolled along the floor.\n\nThe Mill House was really old, and the floors were very uneven.\nThe pencil rolled steadily, with increasing momentum, until it came\nto rest under one of the windows. In the recess of each window\nthere was a broad window-seat, underneath which there was a\ncupboard. My pencil was lying right against the cupboard door. The\ncupboard was shut, but it suddenly occurred to me that if it had\nbeen open my pencil would have rolled inside. I opened the door,\nand my pencil immediately rolled in and sheltered modestly in the\nfarthest corner. I retrieved it, noting as I did so that owing to\nthe lack of light and the peculiar formation of the cupboard one\ncould not see it, but had to feel for it. Apart from my pencil the\ncupboard was empty, but being thorough by nature I tried the one\nunder the opposite window.\n\nAt first sight, it looked as though that also was empty, but I\ngrubbed about perseveringly, and was rewarded by feeling my hand\nclose on a hard paper cylinder which lay in a sort of trough, or\ndepression, in the far corner of the cupboard.", "As soon as I had it\nin my hand, I knew what it was. A roll of Kodak films. Here was a\nfind!\n\nI realized, of course, that these films might very well be an old\nroll belonging to Sir Eustace Pedler which had rolled in here and\nhad not been found when the cupboard was emptied. But I did not\nthink so. The red paper was far too fresh-looking. It was just as\ndusty as it would have been had it laid there for two or three\ndays--that is to say, since the murder. Had it been there for any\nlength of time, it would have been thickly coated.\n\nWho had dropped it? The woman or the man? I remembered that the\ncontents of her handbag had appeared to be intact. If it had been\njerked open in the struggle and the roll of films had fallen out,\nsurely some of the loose money would have been scattered about\nalso? No, it was not the woman who had dropped the films.\n\nI sniffed suddenly and suspiciously. Was the smell of moth balls\nbecoming an obsession with me? I could swear that the roll of films\nsmelt of it also? I held them under my nose. They had, as usual,\na strong smell of their own, but apart from that I could clearly\ndetect the odour I disliked so much. I soon found the cause. A\nminute shred of cloth had caught on a rough edge of the centre\nwood, and that shred was strongly impregnated with moth balls. At\nsome time or another the films had been carried in the overcoat\npocket of the man who was killed in the Tube. Was it he who had\ndropped them here? Hardly. His movements were all accounted for.\n\nNo, it was the other man, the \"doctor.\" He had taken the films when\nhe had taken the paper. It was he who had dropped them here during\nhis struggle with the woman.\n\nI had got my clue! I would have the roll developed, and then I\nwould have further developments to work upon.", "Very elated, I left the house, returned the keys to Mrs. James and\nmade my way as quickly as possible to the station. On the way back\nto town, I took out my paper and studied it afresh. Suddenly the\nfigures took on a new significance. Suppose they were a date? 17\n1 22. The 17th of January, 1922. Surely that must be it! Idiot that\nI was not to have thought of it before. But in that case I _must_\nfind out the whereabouts of Kilmorden Castle, for to-day was\nactually the 14th. Three days. Little enough--almost hopeless when\none had no idea of where to look!\n\nIt was too late to hand in my roll to-day. I had to hurry home to\nKensington so as not to be late for dinner. It occurred to me that\nthere was an easy way of verifying whether some of my conclusions\nwere correct. I asked Mr. Flemming whether there had been a camera\namongst the dead man's belongings. I knew that he had taken an\ninterest in the case and was conversant with all the details.\n\nTo my surprise and annoyance he replied that there had been no\ncamera. All Carton's effects had been gone over very carefully in\nthe hopes of finding something that might throw light upon his\nstate of mind. He was positive that there had been no photographic\napparatus of any kind.\n\nThat was rather a set-back to my theory. If he had no camera, why\nshould he be carrying a roll of films?\n\nI set out early next morning to take my precious roll to be\ndeveloped. I was so fussy that I went all the way to Regent Street\nto the big Kodak place. I handed it in and asked for a print of\neach film. The man finished stacking together a heap of films\npacked in yellow tin cylinders for the tropics, and picked up my\nroll.\n\nHe looked at me.\n\n\"You've made a mistake, I think,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" I said. \"I'm sure I haven't.\"\n\n\"You've given me the wrong roll.", "This is an _unexposed_ one.\"\n\nI walked out with what dignity I could muster. I dare say it is\ngood for one now and again to realize what an idiot one can be!\nBut nobody relishes the process.\n\nAnd then, just as I was passing one of the big shipping offices,\nI came to a sudden halt. In the window was a beautiful model of\none of the company's boats, and it was labelled \"Kenilworth Castle.\"\nA wild idea shot through my brain. I pushed the door open and went\nin. I went up to the counter and in faltering voice (genuine this\ntime!) I murmured:\n\n\"Kilmorden Castle?\"\n\n\"On the 17th from Southampton. Cape Town? First or second class?\"\n\n\"How much is it?\"\n\n\"First class, eighty-seven pounds----\"\n\nI interrupted him. The coincidence was too much for me. Exactly\nthe amount of my legacy! I would put all my eggs in one basket.\n\n\"First class,\" I said.\n\n  _(Extracts from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P.)_\n\n\nIt is an extraordinary thing that I never seem to get any peace.\nI am a man who likes a quiet life. I like my Club, my rubber of\nBridge, a well-cooked meal, a sound wine. I like England in the\nsummer, and the Riviera in the winter. I have no desire to\nparticipate in sensational happenings. Sometimes, in front of a\ngood fire, I do not object to reading about them in the newspaper.\nBut that is as far as I am willing to go. My object in life is to\nbe thoroughly comfortable. I have devoted a certain amount of\nthought, and a considerable amount of money, to further that end.\nBut I cannot say that I always succeed. If things do not actually\nhappen to me, they happen round me, and frequently, in spite of\nmyself, I become involved. I hate being involved.\n\nAll this because Guy Pagett came into my bedroom this morning with\na telegram in his hand and a face as long as a mute at a funeral.\n\nGuy Pagett is my secretary, a zealous, painstaking, hard-working\nfellow, admirable in every respect.", "I know no one who annoys me\nmore. For a long time I have been racking my brains as to how to\nget rid of him. But you cannot very well dismiss a secretary\nbecause he prefers work to play, likes getting up early in the\nmorning, and has positively no vices. The only amusing thing about\nthe fellow is his face. He has the face of a fourteenth-century\npoisoner--the sort of man the Borgias got to do their odd jobs for\nthem.\n\nI wouldn't mind so much if Pagett didn't make me work too. My idea\nof work is something that should be undertaken lightly and\nairily--trifled with, in fact! I doubt if Guy Pagett has ever\ntrifled with anything in his life. He takes everything seriously.\nThat is what makes him so difficult to live with.\n\nLast week I had the brilliant idea of sending him off to Florence.\nHe talked about Florence and how much he wanted to go there.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" I cried, \"you shall go to-morrow. I will pay all\nyour expenses.\"\n\nJanuary isn't the usual time for going to Florence, but it would\nbe all one to Pagett. I could imagine him going about, guide-book\nin hand, religiously doing all the picture galleries. And a week's\nfreedom was cheap to me at the price.\n\nIt has been a delightful week. I have done everything I wanted to,\nand nothing that I did not want to do. But when I blinked my eyes\nopen, and perceived Pagett standing between me and the light at\nthe unearthly hour of 9 a.m. this morning, I realized that freedom\nwas over.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" I said, \"has the funeral already taken place, or\nis it for later in the morning?\"\n\nPagett does not appreciate dry humour. He merely stared.\n\n\"So you know, Sir Eustace?\"\n\n\"Know what?\" I said crossly. \"From the expression of your face I\ninferred that one of your near and dear relatives was to be interred\nthis morning.\"\n\nPagett ignored the sally as far as possible.\n\n\"I thought you couldn't know about this.\"", "He tapped the telegram.\n\"I know you dislike being aroused early--but it _is_ nine\no'clock\"--Pagett insists on regarding 9 a.m. as practically the\nmiddle of the day--\"and I thought that under the circumstances----\"\nHe tapped the telegram again.\n\n\"What is that thing?\" I asked.\n\n\"It's a telegram from the police at Marlow. A woman has been\nmurdered in your house.\"\n\nThat aroused me in earnest.\n\n\"What colossal cheek,\" I exclaimed. \"Why in _my_ house? Who murdered\nher?\"\n\n\"They don't say. I suppose we shall go back to England at once,\nSir Eustace?\"\n\n\"You need suppose nothing of the kind. Why should we go back?\"\n\n\"The police----\"\n\n\"What on earth have I to do with the police?\"\n\n\"Well, it was your house.\"\n\n\"That,\" I said, \"appears to be more my misfortune than my fault.\"\n\nGuy Pagett shook his head gloomily.\n\n\"It will have a very unfortunate effect upon the constituency,\" he\nremarked lugubriously.\n\nI don't see why it should have--and yet I have a feeling that in\nsuch matters Pagett's instincts are always right. On the face of\nit, a Member of Parliament will be none the less efficient because\na stray young woman comes and gets herself murdered in an empty\nhouse that belongs to him--but there is no accounting for the view\nthe respectable British public takes of a matter.\n\n\"She's a foreigner too, and that makes it worse,\" continued Pagett\ngloomily.\n\nAgain I believe he is right. If it is disreputable to have a woman\nmurdered in your house, it becomes more disreputable if the woman\nis a foreigner. Another idea struck me.\n\n\"Good heavens,\" I exclaimed, \"I hope this won't upset Caroline.\"\n\nCaroline is the lady who cooks for me. Incidentally she is the wife\nof my gardener. What kind of a wife she makes I do not know, but\nshe is an excellent cook. James, on the other hand, is not a good\ngardener--but I support him in idleness and give him the lodge to\nlive in solely on account of Caroline's cooking.\n\n\"I don't suppose she'll stay after this,\" said Pagett.", "\"You always were a cheerful fellow,\" I said.\n\nI expect I shall have to go back to England. Pagett clearly intends\nthat I shall. And there is Caroline to pacify.\n\n_Three days later._\n\nIt is incredible to me that any one who can get away from England\nin winter does not do so! It is an abominable climate. All this\ntrouble is very annoying. The house-agents say it will be next to\nimpossible to let the Mill House after all the publicity. Caroline\nhas been pacified--with double pay. We could have sent her a cable\nto that effect from Cannes. In fact, as I have said all along,\nthere was no earthly purpose to serve by our coming over. I shall\ngo back to-morrow.\n\n_One day later._\n\nSeveral very surprising things have occurred. To begin with, I met\nAugustus Milray, the most perfect example of an old ass the present\nGovernment has produced. His manner oozed diplomatic secrecy as he\ndrew me aside in the Club into a quiet corner. He talked a good\ndeal. About South Africa and the industrial situation there. About\nthe growing rumours of a strike on the Rand. Of the secret causes\nactuating that strike. I listened as patiently as I could. Finally,\nhe dropped his voice to a whisper and explained that certain\ndocuments had come to light which ought to be placed in the hands\nof General Smuts.\n\n\"I've no doubt you're quite right,\" I said, stifling a yawn.\n\n\"But how are we to get them to him? Our position in the matter is\ndelicate--very delicate.\"\n\n\"What's wrong with the post?\" I said cheerfully. \"Put a two-penny\nstamp on and drop 'em in the nearest letter-box.\"\n\nHe seemed quite shocked at the suggestion.\n\n\"My dear Pedler! The common post!\"\n\nIt has always been a mystery to me why Governments employ Kings'\nMessengers and draw such attention to their confidential documents.\n\n\"If you don't like the post, send one of your young Foreign Office\nfellows. He'll enjoy the trip.\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" said Milray, wagging his head in a senile fashion.", "\"There are reasons, my dear Pedler--I assure you there are reasons.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, rising, \"all this is very interesting, but I must\nbe off----\"\n\n\"One minute, my dear Pedler, one minute, I beg of you. Now tell\nme, in confidence, is it not true that you intend visiting South\nAfrica shortly yourself? You have large interests in Rhodesia, I\nknow, and the question of Rhodesia joining in the Union is one in\nwhich you have a vital interest.\"\n\n\"Well, I had thought of going out in about a month's time.\"\n\n\"You couldn't possibly make it sooner? This month? This week, in\nfact?\"\n\n\"I could,\" I said, eyeing him with some interest. \"But I don't know\nthat I particularly want to.\"\n\n\"You would be doing the Government a great service--a very great\nservice. You would not find them--er--ungrateful.\"\n\n\"Meaning, you want me to be the postman?\"\n\n\"Exactly. Your position is an unofficial one, your journey is _bona\nfide._ Everything would be eminently satisfactory.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said slowly, \"I don't mind if I do. The one thing I am\nanxious to do is to get out of England again as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"You will find the climate of South Africa delightful--quite\ndelightful.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, I know all about the climate. I was out there\nshortly before the war.\"\n\n\"I am really much obliged to you, Pedler. I will send you round\nthe package by messenger. To be placed in General Smuts's own\nhands, you understand? The _Kilmorden Castle_ sails on Saturday--quite\na good boat.\"\n\nI accompanied him a short way along Pall Mall before we parted. He\nshook me warmly by the hand, and thanked me again effusively.\n\nI walked home reflecting on the curious by-ways of Governmental\npolicy.\n\nIt was the following evening that Jarvis, my butler, informed me\nthat a gentleman wished to see me on private business, but declined\nto give his name. I have always a lively apprehension of insurance\ntouts, so told Jarvis to say I could not see him. Guy Pagett,\nunfortunately, when he might for once have been of real use, was\nlaid up with a bilious attack.", "These earnest, hard-working young\nmen with weak stomachs are always liable to bilious attacks.\n\nJarvis returned.\n\n\"The gentleman asked me to tell you, Sir Eustace, that he comes to\nyou from Mr. Milray.\"\n\nThat altered the complexion of things. A few minutes later I was\nconfronting my visitor in the library. He was a well-built young\nfellow with a deeply tanned face. A scar ran diagonally from the\ncorner of his eye to the jaw, disfiguring what would otherwise have\nbeen a handsome though somewhat reckless countenance.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"what's the matter?\"\n\n\"Mr. Milray sent me to you, Sir Eustace. I am to accompany you to\nSouth Africa as your secretary.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" I said, \"I've got a secretary already. I don't\nwant another.\"\n\n\"I think you do, Sir Eustace. Where is your secretary now?\"\n\n\"He's down with a bilious attack,\" I explained.\n\n\"You are sure it's only a bilious attack?\"\n\n\"Of course it is. He's subject to them.\"\n\nMy visitor smiled.\n\n\"It may or may not be a bilious attack. Time will show. But I can\ntell you this, Sir Eustace, Mr. Milray would not be surprised if\nan attempt were made to get your secretary out of the way. Oh, you\nneed have no fear for yourself\"--I suppose a momentary alarm had\nflickered across my face--\"you are not threatened. Your secretary\nout of the way, access to you would be easier. In any case, Mr.\nMilray wishes me to accompany you. The passage-money will be our\naffair, of course, but you will take the necessary steps about the\npassport, as though you had decided that you needed the services\nof a second secretary.\"\n\nHe seemed a determined young man. We stared at each other and he\nstared me down.\n\n\"Very well,\" I said feebly.\n\n\"You will say nothing to any one as to my accompanying you.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" I said again.\n\nAfter all, perhaps it was better to have this fellow with me, but\nI had a premonition that I was getting into deep waters. Just when\nI thought I had attained peace!", "I stopped my visitor as he was turning to depart.\n\n\"It might be just as well if I knew my new secretary's name,\" I\nobserved sarcastically.\n\nHe considered for a minute.\n\n\"Harry Rayburn seems quite a suitable name,\" he observed.\n\nIt was a curious way of putting it.\n\n\"Very well,\" I said for the third time.\n\n  _(Anne's Narrative Resumed)_\n\n\nIt is most undignified for a heroine to be sea-sick. In books the\nmore it rolls and tosses, the better she likes it. When everybody\nelse is ill, she alone staggers along the deck, braving the elements\nand positively rejoicing in the storm. I regret to say that at the\nfirst roll the _Kilmorden_ gave, I turned pale and hastened below.\nA sympathetic stewardess received me. She suggested dry toast and\nginger ale.\n\nI remained groaning in my cabin for three days. Forgotten was my\nquest. I had no longer any interest in solving mysteries. I was a\ntotally different Anne to the one who had rushed back to the South\nKensington square so jubilantly from the shipping office.\n\nI smile now as I remember my abrupt entry into the drawing-room.\nMrs. Flemming was alone there. She turned her head as I entered.\n\n\"Is that you, Anne, my dear? There is something I want to talk over\nwith you.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" I said, curbing my impatience.\n\n\"Miss Emery is leaving me.\" Miss Emery was the governness. \"As you\nhave not yet succeeded in finding anything, I wondered if you would\ncare--it would be so nice if you remained with us altogether?\"\n\nI was touched. She didn't want me, I knew. It was sheer Christian\ncharity that prompted the offer. I felt remorseful for my secret\ncriticism of her. Getting up, I ran impulsively across the room\nand flung my arms round her neck.\n\n\"You're a dear,\" I said. \"A dear, a dear, a dear! And thank you\never so much. But it's all right, I'm off to South Africa on\nSaturday.\"\n\nMy abrupt onslaught had startled the good lady. She was not used\nto sudden demonstrations of affection. My words startled her still\nmore.", "\"To South Africa? My dear Anne. We would have to look into anything\nof that kind very carefully.\"\n\nThat was the last thing I wanted. I explained that I had already\ntaken my passage, and that upon arrival I proposed to take up the\nduties of a parlourmaid. It was the only thing I could think of on\nthe spur of the moment. There was, I said, a great demand for\nparlourmaids in South Africa. I assured her that I was equal to\ntaking care of myself, and in the end, with a sigh of relief at\ngetting me off her hands, she accepted the project without further\nquery. At parting, she slipped an envelope into my hand. Inside it\nI found five new crisp five-pound notes and the words: \"I hope you\nwill not be offended and will accept this with my love.\" She was\na very good, kind woman. I could not have continued to live in the\nsame house with her, but I did recognize her intrinsic worth.\n\nSo here I was, with twenty-five pounds in my pocket, facing the\nworld and pursuing my adventure.\n\nIt was on the fourth day that the stewardess finally urged me up\non deck. Under the impression that I should die quicker below, I\nhad steadfastly refused to leave my bunk. She now tempted me with\nthe advent of Madeira. Hope rose in my breast. I could leave the\nboat and go ashore and be a parlourmaid there. Anything for dry\nland.\n\nMuffled in coats and rugs, and weak as a kitten on my legs, I was\nhauled up and deposited, an inert mass, on a deck-chair. I lay\nthere with my eyes closed, hating life. The purser, a fair-haired\nyoung man, with a round boyish face, came and sat down beside me.\n\n\"Hullo! Feeling rather sorry for yourself, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, hating him.\n\n\"Ah, you won't know yourself in another day or two. We've had\nrather a nasty dusting in the Bay, but there's smooth weather\nahead. I'll be taking you on at quoits to-morrow.\"", "I did not reply.\n\n\"Think you'll never recover, eh? But I've seen people much worse\nthan you, and two days later they were the life and soul of the\nship. You'll be the same.\"\n\nI did not feel sufficiently pugnacious to tell him outright that\nhe was a liar. I endeavoured to convey it by a glance. He chatted\npleasantly for a few minutes more, then he mercifully departed.\nPeople passed and repassed, brisk couples \"exercising,\" curveting\nchildren, laughing young people. A few other pallid sufferers lay,\nlike myself, in deck-chairs.\n\nThe air was pleasant, crisp, not too cold, and the sun was shining\nbrightly. Insensibly, I felt a little cheered. I began to watch\nthe people. One woman in particular attracted me. She was about\nthirty, of medium height and very fair with a round dimpled face\nand very blue eyes. Her clothes, though perfectly plain, had that\nindefinable air of \"cut\" about them which spoke of Paris. Also, in\na pleasant but self-possessed way, she seemed to own the ship!\n\nDeck stewards ran to and fro obeying her commands. She had a\nspecial deck-chair, and an apparently inexhaustible supply of\ncushions. She changed her mind three times as to where she would\nlike it placed. Throughout everything she remained attractive and\ncharming. She appeared to be one of those rare people in the world\nwho know what they want, see that they get it, and manage to do so\nwithout being offensive. I decided that if I ever recovered--but of\ncourse I shouldn't--it would amuse me to talk to her.\n\nWe reached Madeira about midday. I was still too inert to move,\nbut I enjoyed the picturesque-looking merchants who came on board\nand spread their merchandise about the decks. There were flowers\ntoo. I buried my nose in an enormous bunch of sweet wet violets\nand felt distinctly better. In fact, I thought I might just possibly\nlast out the end of the voyage. When my stewardess spoke of the\nattractions of a little chicken broth, I only protested feebly.\nWhen it came I enjoyed it.", "My attractive woman had been ashore. She came back escorted by a\ntall, soldierly-looking man with dark hair and a bronzed face whom\nI had noticed striding up and down the deck earlier in the day. I\nput him down at once as one of the strong, silent men of Rhodesia.\nHe was about forty, with a touch of greying hair at either temple,\nand was easily the best-looking man on board.\n\nWhen the stewardess brought me up an extra rug I asked her if she\nknew who my attractive woman was.\n\n\"That's a well-known society lady, the Hon. Mrs. Clarence Blair.\nYou must have read about her in the papers.\"\n\nI nodded, looking at her with renewed interest. Mrs. Blair was very\nwell known indeed as one of the smartest women of the day. I\nobserved, with some amusement, that she was the centre of a good\ndeal of attention. Several people essayed to scrape acquaintance\nwith the pleasant informality that a boat allows. I admired the\npolite way that Mrs. Blair snubbed them. She appeared to have\nadopted the strong, silent man as her special cavalier, and he\nseemed duly sensible of the privilege accorded him.\n\nThe following morning, to my surprise, after taking a few turns\nround the deck with her attentive companion, Mrs. Blair came to a\nhalt by my chair.\n\n\"Feeling better this morning?\"\n\nI thanked her, and said I felt slightly more like a human being.\n\n\"You did look ill yesterday. Colonel Race and I decided that we\nshould have the excitement of a funeral at sea--but you've\ndisappointed us.\"\n\nI laughed.\n\n\"Being up in the air has done me good.\"\n\n\"Nothing like fresh air,\" said Colonel Race, smiling.\n\n\"Being shut up in those stuffy cabins would kill any one,\" declared\nMrs. Blair, dropping into a seat by my side and dismissing her\ncompanion with a little nod. \"You've got an outside one, I hope?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"My dear girl! Why don't you change? There's plenty of room. A lot\nof people got off at Madeira, and the boat's very empty.", "Talk to\nthe purser about it. He's a nice little boy--he changed me into a\nbeautiful cabin because I didn't care for the one I'd got. You talk\nto him at lunch-time when you go down.\"\n\nI shuddered.\n\n\"I couldn't move.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly. Come and take a walk now with me.\"\n\nShe dimpled at me encouragingly. I felt very weak on my legs at\nfirst, but as we walked briskly up and down I began to feel a\nbrighter and better being.\n\nAfter a turn or two, Colonel Race joined us again.\n\n\"You can see the Grand Peak of Tenerife from the other side.\"\n\n\"Can we? Can I get a photograph of it, do you think?\"\n\n\"No--but that won't deter you from snapping off at it.\"\n\nMrs. Blair laughed.\n\n\"You are unkind. Some of my photographs are very good.\"\n\n\"About three per cent effective, I should say.\"\n\nWe all went round to the other side of the deck. There glimmering\nwhite and snowy, enveloped in a delicate rose-coloured mist, rose\nthe glistening pinnacle. I uttered an exclamation of delight. Mrs.\nBlair ran for her camera.\n\nUndeterred by Colonel Race's sardonic comments, she snapped\nvigorously:\n\n\"There, that's the end of the roll. Oh,\" her tone changed to one\nof chagrin, \"I've had the thing at 'bulb' all the time.\"\n\n\"I always like to see a child with a new toy,\" murmured the Colonel.\n\n\"How horrid you are--but I've got another roll.\"\n\nShe produced it in triumph from the pocket of her sweater. A sudden\nroll of the boat upset her balance, and as she caught at the rail\nto steady herself the roll of films flashed over the side.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Mrs. Blair, comically dismayed. She leaned over. \"Do\nyou think they have gone overboard?\"\n\n\"No, you may have been fortunate enough to brain an unlucky steward\nin the deck below.\"\n\nA small boy who had arrived unobserved a few paces to our rear blew\na deafening blast on a bugle.\n\n\"Lunch,\" declared Mrs. Blair ecstatically. \"I've had nothing to\neat since breakfast, except two cups of beef-tea.", "Lunch, Miss\nBeddingfeld?\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said waveringly. \"Yes, I _do_ feel rather hungry.\"\n\n\"Splendid. You're sitting at the purser's table, I know. Tackle\nhim about the cabin.\"\n\nI found my way down to the saloon, began to eat gingerly, and\nfinished by consuming an enormous meal. My friend of yesterday\ncongratulated me on my recovery. Every one was changing cabins\nto-day, he told me, and he promised that my things should be moved\nto an outside one without delay.\n\nThere were only four at our table, myself, a couple of elderly\nladies, and a missionary who talked a lot about \"our poor black\nbrothers.\"\n\nI looked round at the other tables. Mrs. Blair was sitting at the\nCaptain's table, Colonel Race next to her. On the other side of\nthe Captain was a distinguished-looking, grey-haired man. A good\nmany people I had already noticed on deck, but there was one man\nwho had not previously appeared. Had he done so, he could hardly\nhave escaped my notice. He was tall and dark, and had such a\npeculiarly sinister type of countenance that I was quite startled.\nI asked the purser, with some curiosity, who he was.\n\n\"That man? Oh, that's Sir Eustace Pedler's secretary. Been very\nsea-sick, poor chap, and not appeared before. Sir Eustace has got\ntwo secretaries with him, and the sea's been too much for both of\nthem. The other fellow hasn't turned up yet. This man's name is\nPagett.\"\n\nSo Sir Eustace Pedler, the owner of the Mill House, was on board.\nProbably only a coincidence, and yet----\n\n\"That's Sir Eustace,\" my informant continued, \"sitting next to the\nCaptain. Pompous old ass.\"\n\nThe more I studied the secretary's face, the less I liked it. Its\neven pallor, the secretive, heavy-lidded eyes, the curiously\nflattened head--it all gave me a feeling of distaste, of apprehension.\n\nLeaving the saloon at the same time as he did, I was close behind\nhim as he went up on deck. He was speaking to Sir Eustace, and I\noverheard a fragment or two. \"I'll see about the cabin at once\nthen, shall I?", "It's impossible to work in yours, with all your\ntrunks.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" Sir Eustace replied. \"My cabin is intended (a)\nfor me to sleep in, and (b) to attempt to dress in. I never had\nany intentions of allowing you to sprawl about the place making an\ninfernal clicking with that typewriter of yours.\"\n\n\"That's just what I say, Sir Eustace, we must have somewhere to\nwork----\"\n\nHere I parted company from them, and went below to see if my\nremoval was in progress. I found my steward busy at the task.\n\n\"Very nice cabin, miss. On D deck. No. 13.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" I cried. \"_Not_ 13.\"\n\nThirteen is the one thing I am superstitious about. It was a nice\ncabin too. I inspected it, wavered, but a foolish superstition\nprevailed. I appealed almost tearfully to the steward.\n\n\"Isn't there any other cabin I can have?\"\n\nThe steward reflected.\n\n\"Well, there's 17, just along on the starboard side. That was empty\nthis morning, but I rather fancy it's been allotted to some one.\nStill, as the gentleman's things aren't in yet, and as gentlemen\naren't anything like so superstitious as ladies, I dare say he\nwouldn't mind changing.\"\n\nI hailed the proposition gratefully, and the steward departed to\nobtain permission from the purser. He returned grinning.\n\n\"That's all right, miss. We can go along.\"\n\nHe led the way to 17. It was not quite as large as No. 13, but I\nfound it eminently satisfactory.\n\n\"I'll fetch your things right away, miss,\" said the steward.\n\nBut at that moment, the man with the sinister face (as I had\nnicknamed him) appeared in the doorway.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" he said, \"but this cabin is reserved for the use of\nSir Eustace Pedler.\"\n\n\"That's all right, sir,\" explained the steward. \"We're fitting up\nNo. 13 instead.\"\n\n\"No, it was No. 17 I was to have.\"\n\n\"No. 13 is a better cabin, sir--larger.\"\n\n\"I specially selected No. 17, and the purser said I could have it.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said coldly. \"But No. 17 has been allotted to me.\"\n\n\"I can't agree to that.\"\n\nThe steward put in his oar.\n\n\"The other cabin's just the same, only better.\"", "\"I want No. 17.\"\n\n\"What's all this?\" demanded a new voice. \"Steward, put my things\nin here. This is my cabin.\"\n\nIt was my neighbor at lunch, the Rev. Edward Chichester.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" I said. \"It's my cabin.\"\n\n\"It is allotted to Sir Eustace Pedler,\" said Mr. Pagett.\n\nWe were all getting rather heated.\n\n\"I'm sorry to have to dispute the matter,\" said Chichester with a\nmeek smile which failed to mask his determination to get his own\nway. Meek men are always obstinate, I have noticed.\n\nHe edged himself sideways into the doorway.\n\n\"You're to have No. 28 on the port side,\" said the steward. \"A very\ngood cabin, sir.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that I must insist. No. 17 was the cabin promised to\nme.\"\n\nWe had come to an impasse. Each one of us was determined not to\ngive way. Strictly speaking, I, at any rate, might have retired\nfrom the contest and eased matters by offering to accept Cabin 28.\nSo long as I did not have 13 it was immaterial to me what other\ncabin I had. But my blood was up. I had not the least intention of\nbeing the first to give way. And I disliked Chichester. He had\nfalse teeth which clicked when he ate. Many men have been hated\nfor less.\n\nWe all said the same things over again. The steward assured us,\neven more strongly, that both the other cabins were better cabins.\nNone of us paid any attention to him.\n\nPagett began to lose his temper. Chichester kept his serenely. With\nan effort I also kept mine. And still none of us would give way an\ninch.\n\nA wink and a whispered word from the steward gave me my cue. I\nfaded unobtrusively from the scene. I was lucky enough to encounter\nthe purser almost immediately.\n\n\"Oh, please,\" I said, \"you did say I could have Cabin 17? And the\nothers won't go away. Mr. Chichester and Mr. Pagett. You _will_\nlet me have it, won't you?\"\n\nI always say that there are no people like sailors for being nice\nto women. My little purser came to the scratch splendidly.", "He\nstrode to the scene, informed the disputants that No. 17 was my\ncabin, they could have Nos. 13 and 28 respectively or stay where\nthey were--whichever they chose.\n\nI permitted my eyes to tell him what a hero he was and then\ninstalled myself in my new domain. The encounter had done me worlds\nof good. The sea was smooth, the weather growing daily warmer.\nSea-sickness was a thing of the past!\n\nI went up on deck and was initiated into the mysteries of\ndeck-quoits. I entered my name for various sports. Tea was served\non deck, and I ate heartily. After tea, I played shovel-board with\nsome pleasant young men. They were extraordinarily nice to me. I\nfelt that life was satisfactory and delightful.\n\nThe dressing bugle came as a surprise and I hurried to my new\ncabin. The stewardess was awaiting me with a troubled face.\n\n\"There's a terrible smell in your cabin, miss. What it is, I'm sure\nI can't think, but I doubt if you'll be able to sleep here. There's\na deck cabin up on C deck, I believe. You might move into that--just\nfor the night, anyway.\"\n\nThe smell really was pretty bad--quite nauseating. I told the\nstewardess I would think over the question of moving whilst I\ndressed. I hurried over my toilet, sniffing distastefully as I did\nso.\n\nWhat _was_ the smell? Dead rat? No, worse than that--and quite\ndifferent. Yet I knew it! It was something I had smelt before.\nSomething----Ah! I had got it. Asafoetida! I had worked in a Hospital\ndispensary during the war for a short time and had become acquainted\nwith various nauseous drugs.\n\nAsafoetida, that was it. But how----\n\nI sank down on the sofa, suddenly realizing the thing. Somebody\nhad put a pinch of asafoetida in my cabin. Why? So that I should\nvacate it? Why were they so anxious to get me out? I thought of\nthe scene this afternoon from a rather different point of view.\nWhat was there about Cabin 17 that made so many people anxious to\nget hold of it?", "The other two cabins were better cabins, why had\nboth men insisted on sticking to 17?\n\n17. How the number persisted. It was on the 17th I had sailed from\nSouthampton. It was a 17--I stopped with a sudden gasp. Quickly I\nunlocked my suit-case, and took my precious paper from its place\nof concealment in some rolled stockings.\n\n17 1 22--I had taken that for a date, the date of departure of the\n_Kilmorden Castle._ Supposing I was wrong. When I came to think of\nit, would any one, writing down a date, think it necessary to put\nthe year as well as the month? Supposing 17 meant _Cabin_ 17? And\n1? The time--one o'clock. Then 22 must be the date. I looked up at\nmy little almanac.\n\nTo-morrow was the 22nd!\n\nI was violently excited. I was sure that I had hit on the right\ntrail at last. One thing was clear, I must not move out of the\ncabin. The asafoetida had got to be borne. I examined my facts\nagain.\n\nTo-morrow was the 22nd, and at 1 a.m. or 1 p.m. something would\nhappen. I plumped for 1 a.m. It was now seven o'clock. In six hours\nI should know.\n\nI don't know how I got through the evening. I retired to my cabin\nfairly early. I had told the stewardess that I had a cold in the\nhead and didn't mind smells. She still seemed distressed, but I\nwas firm.\n\nThe evening seemed interminable. I duly retired to bed, but in view\nof emergencies I swathed myself in a thick flannel dressing-gown,\nand encased my feet in slippers. Thus attired I felt that I could\nspring up and take an active part in anything that happened.\n\nWhat did I expect to happen? I hardly knew. Vague fancies, most of\nthem wildly improbable, flitted through my brain. But one thing I\nwas firmly convinced of, at one o'clock _something_ would happen.\n\nAt various times, I heard my fellow-passengers coming to bed.\nFragments of conversation, laughing good-nights, floated in through\nthe open transom. Then, silence. Most of the lights went out.", "There\nwas still one in the passage outside, and there was therefore a\ncertain amount of light in my cabin. I heard eight bells go. The\nhour that followed seemed the longest I had ever known. I consulted\nmy watch surreptitiously to be sure I had not overshot the time.\n\nIf my deductions were wrong, if nothing happened at one o'clock,\nI should have made a fool of myself, and spent all the money I had\nin the world on a mare's-nest. My heart beat painfully.\n\nTwo bells went overhead. One o'clock! And nothing. Wait--what was\nthat? I heard the quick light patter of feet running--running along\nthe passage.\n\nThen with the suddenness of a bombshell my cabin door burst open\nand a man almost fell inside.\n\n\"Save me,\" he said hoarsely. \"They're after me.\"\n\nIt was not a moment for argument or explanation. I could hear\nfootsteps outside. I had about forty seconds in which to act. I\nhad sprung to my feet and was standing facing the stranger in the\nmiddle of the cabin.\n\nA cabin does not abound in hiding-places for a six-foot man. With\none arm I pulled out my cabin trunk. He slipped down behind it\nunder the bunk. I raised the lid. At the same time, with the other\nhand I pulled down the wash-basin. A deft movement and my hair was\nscrewed into a tiny knot on the top of my head. From the point of\nview of appearance it was inartistic, from another standpoint it\nwas supremely artistic. A lady, with her hair screwed into an\nunbecoming knob and in the act of removing a piece of soap from\nher trunk with which, apparently to wash her neck, could hardly be\nsuspected of harbouring a fugitive.\n\nThere was a knock at the door, and without waiting for me to say,\n\"Come in,\" it was pushed open.\n\nI don't know what I expected to see. I think I had vague ideas of\nMr. Pagett brandishing a revolver. Or my missionary friend with a\nsandbag, or some other lethal weapon.", "But certainly I did not\nexpect to see a night stewardess, with an inquiring face and\nlooking the essence of respectability.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, miss, I thought you called out.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"I didn't.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry for interrupting you.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" I said. \"I couldn't sleep. I thought a wash\nwould do me good.\" It sounded rather as though it were a thing I\nnever had as a general rule.\n\n\"I'm so sorry, miss,\" said the stewardess again. \"But there's a\ngentleman about who's rather drunk, and we are afraid he might get\ninto one of the ladies' cabins and frighten them.\"\n\n\"How dreadful,\" I said, looking alarmed. \"He won't come in here,\nwill he?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't think so, miss. Ring the bell if he does. Good night.\"\n\n\"Good night.\"\n\nI opened the door and peeped down the corridor. Except for the\nretreating form of the stewardess, there was nobody in sight.\n\nDrunk! So that was the explanation of it. My histrionic talents\nhad been wasted. I pulled the cabin trunk out a little farther and\nsaid:\n\n\"Come out at once, please,\" in an acid voice.\n\nThere was no answer. I peered under the bunk. My visitor lay\nimmovable. He seemed to be asleep. I tugged at his shoulder. He\ndid not move.\n\n\"Dead drunk,\" I thought vexedly. \"What _am_ I to do?\"\n\nThen I saw something that made me catch my breath, a small scarlet\nspot on the floor.\n\nUsing all my strength, I succeeded in dragging the man out into\nthe middle of the cabin. The dead whiteness of his face showed that\nhe had fainted. I found the cause of his fainting easily enough.\nHe had been stabbed under the left shoulder-blade--a nasty deep\nwound. I got his coat off and set to work to attend to it.\n\nAt the sting of the cold water he stirred, then sat up.\n\n\"Keep still, please,\" I said.\n\nHe was the kind of young man who recovers his faculties very\nquickly. He pulled himself to his feet and stood there swaying a\nlittle.\n\n\"Thank you, I don't need anything done for me.\"", "His manner was defiant, almost aggressive. Not a word of thanks--of\neven common gratitude!\n\n\"That is a nasty wound. You must let me dress it.\"\n\n\"You will do nothing of the kind.\"\n\nHe flung the words in my face as though I had been begging a favour\nof him. My temper, never placid, rose.\n\n\"I cannot congratulate you upon your manners,\" I said coldly.\n\n\"I can at least relieve you of my presence.\" He started for the\ndoor, but reeled as he did so. With an abrupt movement I pushed\nhim down upon the sofa.\n\n\"Don't be a fool,\" I said unceremoniously. \"You don't want to go\nbleeding all over the ship, do you?\"\n\nHe seemed to see the sense of that, for he sat quietly whilst I\nbandaged up the wound as best I could.\n\n\"There,\" I said, bestowing a pat on my handiwork, \"that will have\nto do for the present. Are you better tempered now and do you feel\ninclined to tell me what it's all about?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry that I can't satisfy your very natural curiosity.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" I said, chagrined.\n\nHe smiled nastily.\n\n\"If you want a thing broadcasted, tell a woman. Otherwise keep your\nmouth shut.\"\n\n\"Don't you think I could keep a secret?\"\n\n\"I don't think--I know.\"\n\nHe rose to his feet.\n\n\"At any rate,\" I said spitefully, \"I shall be able to do a little\nbroadcasting about the events of this evening.\"\n\n\"I've no doubt you will too,\" he said indifferently.\n\n\"How dare you?\" I cried angrily.\n\nWe were facing each other, glaring at each other with the ferocity\nof bitter enemies. For the first time, I took in the details of\nhis appearance, the close-cropped dark head, the lean jaw, the scar\non the brown cheek, the curious light grey eyes that looked into\nmine with a sort of reckless mockery hard to describe. There was\nsomething dangerous about him.\n\n\"You haven't thanked me yet for saving your life?\" I said with\nfalse sweetness.\n\nI hit him there. I saw him flinch distinctly. Intuitively I knew\nthat he hated above all to be reminded that he owed his life to\nme.", "I didn't care. I wanted to hurt him. I had never wanted to hurt\nany one so much.\n\n\"I wish to God you hadn't!\" he said explosively. \"I'd be better\ndead and out of it.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you acknowledge the debt. You can't get out of it. I\nsaved your life and I'm waiting for you to say 'Thank you.'\"\n\nIf looks could have killed, I think he would have liked to kill me\nthen. He pushed roughly past me. At the door he turned back, and\nspoke over his shoulder.\n\n\"I shall not thank you--now or at any other time. But I acknowledge\nthe debt. Some day I will pay it.\"\n\nHe was gone, leaving me with clenched hands, and my heart beating\nlike a mill race.\n\nThere were no further excitements that night. I had breakfast in\nbed and got up late the next morning. Mrs. Blair hailed me as I\ncame on deck.\n\n\"Good-morning, Gipsy girl, sit down here by me. You look as though\nyou hadn't slept well.\"\n\n\"Why do you call me that?\" I asked, as I sat down obediently.\n\n\"Do you mind? It suits you somehow. I've called you that in my own\nmind from the beginning. It's the gipsy element in you that makes\nyou so different from any one else. I decided in my own mind that\nyou and Colonel Race were the only two people on board who wouldn't\nbore me to death to talk to.\"\n\n\"That's funny,\" I said, \"I thought the same about you--only it's\nmore understandable in your case. You're--you're such an exquisitely\nfinished product.\"\n\n\"Not badly put,\" said Mrs. Blair, nodding her head. \"Tell me all\nabout yourself, Gipsy girl. Why are you going to South Africa?\"\n\nI told her something about Papa's life work.\n\n\"So you're Charles Beddingfeld's daughter? I thought you weren't\na mere provincial Miss! Are you going to Broken Hill to grub up\nmore skulls?\"\n\n\"I may,\" I said cautiously. \"I've got other plans as well.\"\n\n\"What a mysterious minx you are. But you do look tired this morning.", "Didn't you sleep well? I can't keep awake on board a boat. Ten\nhours' sleep for a fool, they say! I could do with twenty!\"\n\nShe yawned, looking like a sleepy kitten. \"An idiot of a steward\nwoke me up in the middle of the night to return me that roll of\nfilms I dropped yesterday. He did it in the most melodramatic\nmanner, stuck his arm through the ventilator and dropped them\nnearly in the middle of my tummy. I thought it was a bomb for a\nmoment!\"\n\n\"Here's your Colonel,\" I said, as the tall soldierly figure of\nColonel Race appeared on the deck.\n\n\"He's not my Colonel particularly. In fact he admires _you_ very\nmuch, Gipsy girl. So don't run away.\"\n\n\"I want to tie something round my head. It will be more comfortable\nthan a hat.\"\n\nI slipped quickly away. For some reason or other I was uncomfortable\nwith Colonel Race. He was one of the few people who were capable\nof making me feel shy.\n\nI went down to my cabin and began looking for a broad band of\nribbon, or a motor-veil, with which I could restrain my rebellious\nlocks. Now I am a tidy person, I like my things always arranged in\na certain way and I keep them so. I had no sooner opened my drawer\nthan I realized that somebody had been disarranging my things.\nEverything had been turned over and scattered. I looked in the\nother drawers and the small hanging cupboard. They told me the same\ntale. It was as though some one had been making a hurried and\nineffectual search for something.\n\nI sat down on the edge of the bunk with a grave face. Who had been\nsearching my cabin and what had they been looking for? Was it the\nhalf-sheet of paper with scribbled figures and words? I shook my\nhead, dissatisfied. Surely that was past history now. But what else\ncould there be?\n\nI wanted to think. The events of last night, though exciting, had\nnot really done anything to elucidate matters. Who was the young\nman who had burst into my cabin so abruptly?", "I had not seen him on\nboard previously, either on deck or in the saloon. Was he one of\nthe ship's company or was he a passenger? Who had stabbed him? Why\nhad they stabbed him? And why, in the name of goodness, should\nCabin No. 17 figure so prominently? It was all a mystery, but there\nwas no doubt that some very peculiar occurrences were taking place\non the _Kilmorden Castle._\n\nI counted off on my fingers the people on whom it behoved me to\nkeep a watch.\n\nSetting aside my visitor of the night before, but promising myself\nthat I would discover him on board before another day had passed,\nI selected the following persons as worthy of my notice.\n\n(1) Sir Eustace Pedler. He was the owner of the Mill House and his\npresence on the _Kilmorden Castle_ seemed something of a coincidence.\n\n(2) Mr. Pagett, the sinister-looking secretary, whose eagerness to\nobtain Cabin 17 had been so very marked. N.B. Find out whether he\nhad accompanied Sir Eustace to Cannes.\n\n(3) The Rev. Edward Chichester. All I had against him was his\nobstinacy over Cabin 17, and that might be entirely due to his own\npeculiar temperament. Obstinacy can be an amazing thing.\n\nBut a little conversation with Mr. Chichester would not come amiss,\nI decided. Hastily tying a handkerchief round my rebellious locks,\nI went up on deck again, full of purpose. I was in luck. My quarry\nwas leaning against the rail, drinking beef tea. I went up to him.\n\n\"I hope you've forgiven me over Cabin 17,\" I said, with my best\nsmile.\n\n\"I consider it unchristian to bear a grudge,\" said Mr. Chichester\ncoldly. \"But the purser had distinctly promised me that cabin.\"\n\n\"Pursers are such busy men, aren't they?\" I said vaguely. \"I\nsuppose they're bound to forget sometimes.\"\n\nMr. Chichester did not reply.\n\n\"Is this your first visit to Africa?\" I inquired conversationally.\n\n\"To South Africa, yes. But I have worked for the last two years\namongst the cannibal tribes in the interior of East Africa.\"\n\n\"How thrilling! Have you had many narrow escapes?\"\n\n\"Escapes?\"", "\"Of being eaten, I mean?\"\n\n\"You should not treat sacred subjects with levity, Miss Beddingfeld.\"\n\n\"I didn't know that cannibalism was a sacred subject,\" I retorted,\nstung.\n\nAs the words left my lips, another idea struck me. If Mr. Chichester\nhad indeed spent the last two years in the interior of Africa, how\nwas it that he was not more sunburnt? His skin was as pink and\nwhite as a baby's. Surely there was something fishy there? Yet his\nmanner and voice were so absolutely _it._ Too much so perhaps. Was\nhe--or was he not--just a little like a _stage_ clergyman?\n\nI cast my mind back to the curates I had known at Little Hampsly.\nSome of them I had liked, some of them I had not, but certainly\nnone of them had been quite like Mr. Chichester. They had been\nhuman--he was a glorified type.\n\nI was debating all this when Sir Eustace Pedler passed down the\ndeck. Just as he was abreast of Mr. Chichester, he stooped and\npicked up a piece of paper which he handed to him, remarking\n\"You've dropped something.\"\n\nHe passed on without stopping, and so probably did not notice Mr.\nChichester's agitation. I did. Whatever it was he had dropped, its\nrecovery agitated him considerably. He turned a sickly green, and\ncrumpled up the sheet of paper into a ball. My suspicions were\naccentuated a hundred-fold.\n\nHe caught my eye, and hurried into explanations.\n\n\"A--a--fragment of a sermon I was composing,\" he said with a sickly\nsmile.\n\n\"Indeed?\" I rejoined politely.\n\nA fragment of a sermon, indeed! No, Mr. Chichester--too weak for\nwords!\n\nHe soon left me with a muttered excuse. I wished, oh, how I wished,\nthat I had been the one to pick up that paper and not Sir Eustace\nPedler! One thing was clear, Mr. Chichester could not be exempted\nfrom my list of suspects. I was inclined to put him top of the\nthree.\n\nAfter lunch, when I came up to the lounge for coffee, I noticed\nSir Eustace and Pagett sitting with Mrs.", "Blair and Colonel Race.\nMrs. Blair welcomed me with a smile, so I went over and joined\nthem. They were talking about Italy.\n\n\"But it _is_ misleading,\" Mrs. Blair insisted. _\"Aqua calda_\ncertainly _ought_ to be cold water--not hot.\"\n\n\"You're not a Latin scholar,\" said Sir Eustace, smiling.\n\n\"Men are so superior about their Latin,\" said Mrs. Blair. \"But all\nthe same I notice that when you ask them to translate inscriptions\nin old churches they can never do it! They hem and haw, and get\nout of it somehow.\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" said Colonel Race. \"I always do.\"\n\n\"But I love the Italians,\" continued Mrs. Blair. \"They're so\nobliging--though even that has its embarrassing side. You ask them\nthe way somewhere, and instead of saying 'first to the right,\nsecond to the left' or something that one could follow, they pour\nout a flood of well-meaning directions, and when you look bewildered\nthey take you kindly by the arm and walk all the way there with\nyou.\"\n\n\"Is that your experience in Florence, Pagett?\" asked Sir Eustace,\nturning with a smile to his secretary.\n\nFor some reason the question seemed to disconcert Mr. Pagett. He\nstammered and flushed.\n\n\"Oh, quite so, yes--er quite so.\"\n\nThen with a murmured excuse, he rose and left the table.\n\n\"I am beginning to suspect Guy Pagett of having committed some dark\ndeed in Florence,\" remarked Sir Eustace, gazing after his\nsecretary's retreating figure. \"Whenever Florence or Italy is\nmentioned, he changes the subject, or bolts precipitately.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he murdered some one there,\" said Mrs. Blair hopefully.\n\"He looks--I hope I'm not hurting your feelings, Sir Eustace--but he\ndoes look as though he might murder some one.\"\n\n\"Yes, pure Cinquecento! It amuses me sometimes--especially when one\nknows as well as I do how essentially law-abiding and respectable\nthe poor fellow really is.\"\n\n\"He's been with you some time, hasn't he, Sir Eustace?\" asked\nColonel Race.\n\n\"Six years,\" said Sir Eustace, with a deep sigh.\n\n\"He must be quite invaluable to you,\" said Mrs. Blair.\n\n\"Oh, invaluable! Yes, quite invaluable.\"", "The poor man sounded even\nmore depressed, as though the invaluableness of Mr. Pagett was a\nsecret grief to him. Then he added more briskly: \"But his face\nshould really inspire you with confidence, my dear lady. No\nself-respecting murderer would ever consent to look like one.\nCrippen, now, I believe, was one of the pleasantest fellows\nimaginable.\"\n\n\"He was caught on a liner, wasn't he?\" murmured Mrs. Blair.\n\nThere was a slight rattle behind us. I turned quickly. Mr.\nChichester had dropped his coffee-cup.\n\nOur party soon broke up; Mrs. Blair went below to sleep and I went\nout on deck. Colonel Race followed me.\n\n\"You're very elusive, Miss Beddingfeld. I looked for you everywhere\nlast night at the dance.\"\n\n\"I went to bed early,\" I explained.\n\n\"Are you going to run away to-night too? Or are you going to dance\nwith me?\"\n\n\"I shall be very pleased to dance with you,\" I murmured shyly. \"But\nMrs. Blair----\"\n\n\"Our friend, Mrs. Blair, doesn't care for dancing.\"\n\n\"And you do?\"\n\n\"I care for dancing with you.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" I said nervously.\n\nI was a little afraid of Colonel Race. Nevertheless I was enjoying\nmyself. This was better than discussing fossilized skulls with\nstuffy old professors! Colonel Race was really just my ideal of a\nstern silent Rhodesian. Possibly I might marry him! I hadn't been\nasked, it is true, but, as the Boy Scouts say, Be Prepared! And\nall women, without in the least meaning it, consider every man they\nmeet as a possible husband for themselves or for their best friend.\n\nI danced several times with him that evening. He danced well. When\nthe dancing was over, and I was thinking of going to bed, he\nsuggested a turn round the deck. We walked round three times and\nfinally subsided into two deck-chairs. There was nobody else in\nsight. We made desultory conversation for some time.\n\n\"Do you know, Miss Beddingfeld, I think that I once met your\nfather? A very interesting man--on his own subject, and it's a\nsubject that has a special fascination for me.", "In my humble way,\nI've done a bit in that line myself. Why, when I was in the Dordogne\nregion----\"\n\nOur talk became technical. Colonel Race's boast was not an idle\none. He knew a great deal. At the same time, he made one or two\ncurious mistakes--slips of the tongue, I might almost have thought\nthem. But he was quick to take his cue from me and to cover them\nup. Once he spoke of the Mousterian period as succeeding the\nAurignacian--an absurd mistake for one who knew anything of the\nsubject.\n\nIt was twelve o'clock when I went to my cabin. I was still puzzling\nover those queer discrepancies. Was it possible that he had \"got\nthe whole subject up\" for the occasion--that really he knew nothing\nof archaeology? I shook my head, vaguely dissatisfied with that\nsolution.\n\nJust as I was dropping off to sleep, I sat up with a sudden start\nas another idea flashed into my head. Had _he_ been pumping _me?_\nWere those slight inaccuracies just tests--to see whether I really\nknew what I was talking about? In other words, he suspected me of\nnot being genuinely Anne Beddingfeld.\n\nWhy?\n\n  _(Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)_\n\n\nThere is something to be said for life on board ship. It is\npeaceful. My grey hairs fortunately exempt me from the indignities\nof bobbing for apples, running up and down the deck with potatoes\nand eggs, and the more painful sports of \"Brother Bill\" and Bolster\nBar. What amusement people can find in these painful proceedings\nhas always been a mystery to me. But there are many fools in the\nworld. One praises God for their existence and keeps out of their\nway.\n\nFortunately I am an excellent sailor. Pagett, poor fellow, is not.\nHe began turning green as soon as we were out of the Solent. I\npresume my other so-called secretary is also sea-sick. At any rate\nhe has not yet made his appearance. But perhaps it is not\nsea-sickness, but high diplomacy. The great thing is that I have\nnot been worried by him.", "On the whole, the people on board are a mangy lot. Only two decent\nBridge players and one decent-looking woman--Mrs. Clarence Blair.\nI've met her in town of course. She is one of the only women I know\nwho can lay claim to a sense of humour. I enjoy talking to her,\nand should enjoy it more if it were not for a long-legged taciturn\nass who has attached himself to her like a limpet. I cannot think\nthat this Colonel Race really amuses her. He's good-looking in his\nway, but dull as ditch water. One of these strong silent men that\nlady novelists and young girls always rave over.\n\nGuy Pagett struggled up on deck after we left Madeira and began\nbabbling in a hollow voice about work. What the devil does any one\nwant to work for on board ship? It is true that I promised my\npublishers my \"Reminiscences\" early in the summer, but what of it?\nWho really reads reminiscences? Old ladies in the suburbs. And what\ndo my reminiscences amount to? I've knocked against a certain\nnumber of so-called famous people in my lifetime. With the\nassistance of Pagett, I invent insipid anecdotes about them. And,\nthe truth of the matter is, Pagett is too honest for the job. He\nwon't let me invent anecdotes about the people I might have met\nbut haven't.\n\nI tried kindness with him.\n\n\"You look a perfect wreck still, my dear chap,\" I said easily.\n\"What you need is a deck-chair in the sun. No--not another word.\nThe work must wait.\"\n\nThe next thing I knew he was worrying about an extra cabin. \"There's\nno room to work in your cabin, Sir Eustace. It's full of trunks.\"\n\nFrom his tone, you might have thought that trunks were blackbeetles,\nsomething that had no business to be there.\n\nI explained to him that, though he might not be aware of the fact,\nit was usual to take a change of clothing with one when travelling.\nHe gave the wan smile with which he always greets my attempts at\nhumour, and then reverted to the business in hand.", "\"And we could hardly work in my little hole.\"\n\nI know Pagett's \"little holes\"--he usually has the best cabin on\nthe ship.\n\n\"I'm sorry the Captain didn't turn out for you this time,\" I said\nsarcastically. \"Perhaps you'd like to dump some of your extra\nluggage in my cabin?\"\n\nSarcasm is dangerous with a man like Pagett. He brightened up at\nonce.\n\n\"Well, if I could get rid of the typewriter and the stationery\ntrunk----\"\n\nThe stationery trunk weighs several solid tons. It causes endless\nunpleasantness with the porters, and it is the aim of Pagett's life\nto foist it on me. It is a perpetual struggle between us. He seems\nto regard it as my special personal property. I, on the other hand,\nregard the charge of it as the only thing where a secretary is\nreally useful.\n\n\"We'll get an extra cabin,\" I said hastily.\n\nThe thing seemed simple enough, but Pagett is a person who loves\nto make mysteries. He came to me the next day with a face like a\nRenaissance conspirator.\n\n\"You know you told me to get Cabin 17 for an office?\"\n\n\"Well, what of it? Has the stationery trunk jammed in the doorway?\"\n\n\"The doorways are the same size in all the cabins,\" replied Pagett\nseriously. \"But I tell you, Sir Eustace, there's something very\nqueer about that cabin.\"\n\nMemories of reading _The Upper Berth_ floated through my mind.\n\n\"If you mean that it's haunted,\" I said, \"we're not going to sleep\nthere, so I don't see that it matters. Ghosts don't affect\ntypewriters.\"\n\nPagett said that it wasn't a ghost, and that, after all, he hadn't\ngot Cabin 17. He told me a long, garbled story. Apparently he, and\na Mr. Chichester, and a girl called Beddingfeld, had almost come\nto blows over the cabin. Needless to say, the girl had won, and\nPagett was apparently feeling sore over the matter.\n\n\"Both 13 and 28 are better cabins,\" he reiterated. \"But they\nwouldn't look at them.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, stifling a yawn, \"for that matter, no more would\nyou, my dear Pagett.\"\n\nHe gave me a reproachful look.", "\"You _told_ me to get Cabin 17.\"\n\nThere is a touch of the \"boy upon the burning deck\" about Pagett.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" I said testily, \"I mentioned No. 17 because I\nhappened to observe that it was vacant. But I didn't mean you to\nmake a stand to the death about it--13 or 28 would have done us\nequally well.\"\n\nHe looked hurt.\n\n\"There's something more, though,\" he insisted. \"Miss Beddingfeld\ngot the cabin, but this morning I saw Chichester coming out of it\nin a furtive sort of way.\"\n\nI looked at him severely.\n\n\"If you're trying to get up a nasty scandal about Chichester, who\nis a missionary--though a perfectly poisonous person--and that\nattractive child, Anne Beddingfeld, I don't believe a word of it,\"\nI said coldly. \"Anne Beddingfeld is an extremely nice girl--with\nparticularly good legs. I should say she had far and away the best\nlegs on board.\"\n\nPagett did not like my reference to Anne Beddingfeld's legs. He is\nthe sort of man who never notices legs himself--or, if he does,\nwould die sooner than say so. Also he thinks my appreciation of\nsuch things frivolous. I like annoying Pagett, so I continued\nmaliciously:\n\n\"As you've made her acquaintance, you might ask her to dine at our\ntable to-morrow night. It's the Fancy Dress dance. By the way,\nyou'd better go down to the barber and select a fancy costume for\nme.\"\n\n\"Surely you will not go in fancy dress?\" said Pagett, in tones of\nhorror.\n\nI could see that it was quite incompatible with his idea of my\ndignity. He looked shocked and pained. I had really had no intention\nof donning fancy dress, but the complete discomfiture of Pagett\nwas too tempting to be forborne.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I said. \"Of course I shall wear fancy dress.\nSo will you.\"\n\nPagett shuddered.\n\n\"So go down to the barber's and see about it,\" I finished.\n\n\"I don't think he'll have any out sizes,\" murmured Pagett, measuring\nmy figure with his eye.\n\nWithout meaning it, Pagett can occasionally be extremely offensive.", "\"And order a table for six in the saloon,\" I said. \"We'll have the\nCaptain, the girl with the nice legs, Mrs. Blair----\"\n\n\"You won't get Mrs. Blair without Colonel Race,\" Pagett interposed.\n\"He's asked her to dine with him, I know.\"\n\nPagett always knows everything. I was justifiably annoyed.\n\n\"Who _is_ Race?\" I demanded, exasperated.\n\nAs I said before, Pagett always knows everything--or thinks he does.\nHe looked mysterious again.\n\n\"They say he's a Secret Service chap, Sir Eustace. Rather a great\ngun too. But of course I don't know for certain.\"\n\n\"Isn't that like the Government?\" I exclaimed. \"Here's a man on\nboard whose business it is to carry about secret documents, and\nthey go giving them to a peaceful outsider, who only asks to be\nlet alone.\"\n\nPagett looked even more mysterious. He came a pace nearer and\ndropped his voice.\n\n\"If you ask me, the whole thing is very queer, Sir Eustace. Look\nat that illness of mine before we started----\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" I interrupted brutally, \"that was a bilious\nattack. You're always having bilious attacks.\"\n\nPagett winced slightly.\n\n\"It wasn't the usual sort of bilious attack. This time----\n\n\"For God's sake, don't go into the details of your condition,\nPagett. I don't want to hear them.\"\n\n\"Very well, Sir Eustace. But my belief is that I was deliberately\n_poisoned!\"_\n\n\"Ah!\" I said. \"You've been talking to Rayburn.\"\n\nHe did not deny it.\n\n\"At any rate, Sir Eustace, _he_ thinks so--and he should be in a\nposition to know.\"\n\n\"By the way, where is the chap?\" I asked. \"I've not set eyes on\nhim since we came on board.\"\n\n\"He gives out that he's ill, and stays in his cabin, Sir Eustace.\"\nPagett's voice dropped again. \"But that's _camouflage,_ I'm sure.\nSo that he can watch better.\"\n\n\"Watch?\"\n\n\"Over your safety, Sir Eustace. In case an attack should be made\nupon you.\"\n\n\"You're such a cheerful fellow, Pagett,\" I said. \"I trust that your\nimagination runs away with you. If I were you I should go to the\ndance as a death's head or an executioner.", "It will suit your\nmournful style of beauty.\"\n\nThat shut him up for the time being. I went on deck. The Beddingfeld\ngirl was deep in conversation with the missionary parson,\nChichester. Women always flutter round parsons.\n\nA man of my figure hates stooping, but I had the courtesy to pick\nup a bit of paper that was fluttering round the parson's feet.\n\nI got no word of thanks for my pains. As a matter of fact, I\ncouldn't help seeing what was written on the sheet of paper. There\nwas just one sentence:\n\n\"Don't try to play a lone hand or it will be the worse for you.\"\n\nThat's a nice thing for a parson to have. Who is this fellow\nChichester, I wonder? He _looks_ mild as milk. But looks are\ndeceptive. I shall ask Pagett about him. Pagett always knows\neverything.\n\nI sank gracefully into my deck-chair by the side of Mrs. Blair,\nthereby interrupting her _tete-a-tete_ with Race, and remarked that\nI didn't know what the clergy were coming to nowadays.\n\nThen I asked her to dine with me on the night of the Fancy Dress\ndance. Somehow or other Race managed to get included in the\ninvitation.\n\nAfter lunch the Beddingfeld girl came and sat with us for coffee.\nI was right about her legs. They _are_ the best on the ship. I\nshall certainly ask her to dinner as well.\n\nI would very much like to know what mischief Pagett was up to in\nFlorence. Whenever Italy is mentioned, he goes to pieces. If I did\nnot know how intensely respectable he is--I should suspect him of\nsome disreputable _amour_ . . .\n\nI wonder now! Even the most respectable men----It would cheer me up\nenormously if it was so.\n\nPagett--with a guilty secret! Splendid!\n\nIt has been a curious evening.\n\nThe only costume that fitted me in the barber's emporium was that\nof a Teddy Bear. I don't mind playing bears with some nice young\ngirls on a winter's evening in England--but it's hardly an ideal\ncostume for the equator.", "However, I created a good deal of\nmerriment, and won first prize for \"brought on board\"--an absurd\nterm for a costume hired for the evening. Still as nobody seemed\nto have the least idea whether they were made or brought, it didn't\nmatter.\n\nMrs. Blair refused to dress up. Apparently she is at one with\nPagett on the matter. Colonel Race followed her example. Anne\nBeddingfeld had concocted a gipsy costume for herself, and looked\nextraordinarily well. Pagett said he had a headache and didn't\nappear. To replace him I asked a quaint little fellow called\nReeves. He's a prominent member of the South African Labour party.\nHorrible little man, but I want to keep in with him, as he gives\nme information that I need. I want to understand this Rand business\nfrom both sides.\n\nDancing was a hot affair. I danced twice with Anne Beddingfeld and\nshe had to pretend she liked it. I danced once with Mrs. Blair,\nwho didn't trouble to pretend, and I victimized various other\ndamsels whose appearance struck me favourably.\n\nThen we went down to supper. I had ordered champagne; the steward\nsuggested Clicquot 1911 as being the best they had on the boat and\nI fell in with his suggestion. I seemed to have hit on the one\nthing that would loosen Colonel Race's tongue. Far from being\ntaciturn, the man became actually talkative. For a while this\namused me, then it occurred to me that Colonel Race, and not\nmyself, was becoming the life and soul of the party. He chaffed me\nat length about keeping a diary.\n\n\"It will reveal all your indiscretions one of these days, Pedler.\"\n\n\"My dear Race,\" I said, \"I venture to suggest that I am not quite\nthe fool you think me. I may commit indiscretions, but I don't\nwrite them down in black and white. After my death, my executors\nwill know my opinion of a great many people, but I doubt if they\nwill find anything to add or detract from their opinion of _me._\nA diary is useful for recording the idiosyncrasies of other\npeople--but not one's own.\"", "\"There is such a thing as unconscious self-revelation, though.\"\n\n\"In the eyes of the psycho-analyst, all things are vile,\" I replied\nsententiously.\n\n\"You must have had a very interesting life, Colonel Race?\" said\nMiss Beddingfeld, gazing at him with wide, starry eyes.\n\nThat's how they do it, these girls! Othello charmed Desdemona by\ntelling her stories, but, oh, didn't Desdemona charm Othello by\nthe way she listened?\n\nAnyway, the girl set Race off all right. He began to tell lion\nstories. A man who has shot lions in large quantities has an unfair\nadvantage over other men. It seemed to me that it was time I, too,\ntold a lion story. One of a more sprightly character.\n\n\"By the way,\" I remarked, \"that reminds me of a rather exciting\ntale I heard. A friend of mine was out on a shooting trip somewhere\nin East Africa. One night he came out of his tent for some reason,\nand was startled by a low growl. He turned sharply and saw a lion\ncrouching to spring. He had left his rifle in the tent. Quick as\nthought, he ducked, and the lion sprang right over his head.\nAnnoyed at having missed him, the animal growled and prepared to\nspring again. Again he ducked, and again the lion sprang right over\nhim. This happened a third time, but by now he was close to the\nentrance of the tent, and he darted in and seized his rifle. When\nhe emerged, rifle in hand, the lion had disappeared. That puzzled\nhim greatly. He crept round the back of the tent, where there was\na little clearing. There, sure enough, was the lion, busily\npractising low jumps.\"\n\nThis was received with a roar of applause. I drank some champagne.\n\n\"On another occasion,\" I remarked, \"this friend of mine had a\nsecond curious experience. He was trekking across country, and\nbeing anxious to arrive at his destination before the heat of the\nday he ordered his boys to inspan whilst it was still dark. They\nhad some trouble in doing so, as the mules were very restive, but\nat last they managed it, and a start was made.", "The mules raced\nalong like the wind, and when daylight came they saw why. In the\ndarkness, the boys had inspanned a lion as the near wheeler.\"\n\nThis, too, was well received, a ripple of merriment going round\nthe table, but I am not sure that the greatest tribute did not come\nfrom my friend, the Labour Member, who remained pale and serious.\n\n\"My God!\" he said anxiously. \"Who un'arnessed them?\"\n\n\"I must go to Rhodesia,\" said Mrs. Blair. \"After what you have told\nus, Colonel Race, I simply must. It's a horrible journey though,\nfive days in the train.\"\n\n\"You must join me on my private car,\" I said gallantly. \"Oh, Sir\nEustace, how sweet of you, do you really mean it?\"\n\n\"Do I mean it!\" I exclaimed reproachfully, and drank another glass\nof champagne.\n\n\"Just about another week, and we shall be in South Africa,\" sighed\nMrs. Blair.\n\n\"Ah, South Africa,\" I said sentimentally, and began to quote from\na recent speech of mine at the Colonial Institute. \"What has South\nAfrica to show the world? What indeed? Her fruit and her farms,\nher wool and her wattles, her herds and her hides, her gold and\nher diamonds----\"\n\nI was hurrying on, because I knew that as soon as I paused Reeves\nwould butt in and inform me that the hides were worthless because\nthe animals hung themselves up on barbed wire or something of that\nsort, would crab everything else, and end up with the hardships of\nthe miners on the Rand. And I was not in the mood to be abused as\na Capitalist. However, the interruption came from another source\nat the magic word diamonds.\n\n\"Diamonds!\" said Mrs. Blair ecstatically.\n\n\"Diamonds!\" breathed Miss Beddingfeld.\n\nThey both addressed Colonel Race.\n\n\"I suppose you've been to Kimberley?\"\n\nI had been to Kimberley too, but I didn't manage to say so in time.\nRace was being inundated with questions. What were mines like? Was\nit true that the natives were kept shut up in compounds? And so\non.\n\nRace answered their questions and showed a good knowledge of his\nsubject.", "He described the methods of housing the natives, the\nsearches instituted, and the various precautions that De Beers\ntook.\n\n\"Then it's practically impossible to steal any diamonds?\" asked\nMrs. Blair with as keen an air of disappointment as though she had\nbeen journeying there for the express purpose.\n\n\"Nothing's impossible, Mrs. Blair. Thefts do occur--like the case\nI told you of where the Kafir hid the stone in his wound.\"\n\n\"Yes, but on a large scale?\"\n\n\"Once, in recent years. Just before the War in fact. You must\nremember the case, Pedler. You were in South Africa at the time?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Tell us,\" cried Miss Beddingfeld. \"Oh, do tell us!\"\n\nRace smiled.\n\n\"Very well, you shall have the story. I suppose most of you have\nheard of Sir Laurence Eardsley, the great South African mining\nmagnate? His mines were gold mines, but he comes into the story\nthrough his son. You may remember that just before the War rumours\nwere afield of a new potential Kimberley hidden somewhere in the\nrocky floor of the British Guiana jungles. Two young explorers, so\nit was reported, had returned from that part of South America\nbringing with them a remarkable collection of rough diamonds, some\nof them of considerable size. Diamonds of small size had been found\nbefore in the neighbourhood of the Essequibo and Mazaruni rivers,\nbut these two young men, John Eardsley and his friend Lucas,\nclaimed to have discovered beds of great carbon deposits at the\ncommon head of two streams. The diamonds were of every colour,\npink, blue, yellow, green, black, and the purest white. Eardsley\nand Lucas came to Kimberley where they were to submit their gems\nto inspection. At the same time a sensational robbery was found to\nhave taken place at De Beers. When sending diamonds to England they\nare made up into a packet. This remains in the big safe, of which\nthe two keys are held by two different men whilst a third man knows\nthe combination. They are handed to the Bank, and the Bank send\nthem to England. Each package is worth, roughly, about PS100,000.", "\"On this occasion, the Bank were struck by something a little\nunusual about the sealing of the packet. It was opened, and found\nto contain knobs of sugar!\n\n\"Exactly how suspicion came to fasten on John Eardsley I do not\nknow. It was remembered that he had been very wild at Cambridge\nand that his father had paid his debts more than once. Anyhow, it\nsoon got about that this story of South American diamond fields\nwas all a fantasy. John Eardsley was arrested. In his possession\nwas found a portion of the De Beer diamonds.\n\n\"But the case never came to court. Sir Laurence Eardsley paid over\na sum equal to the missing diamonds and De Beers did not prosecute.\nExactly how the robbery was committed has never been known. But\nthe knowledge that his son was a thief broke the old man's heart.\nHe had a stroke shortly afterwards. As for John, his Fate was in\na way merciful. He enlisted, went to the War, fought there bravely,\nand was killed, thus wiping out the stain on his name. Sir Laurence\nhimself had a third stroke and died about a month ago. He died\nintestate and his vast fortune passed to his next of kin, a man\nwhom he hardly knew.\"\n\nThe Colonel paused. A babel of ejaculations and questions broke\nout. Something seemed to attract Miss Beddingfeld's attention, and\nshe turned in her chair. At the little gasp she gave, I, too,\nturned.\n\nMy new secretary, Rayburn, was standing in the doorway. Under his\ntan, his face had the pallor of one who has seen a ghost. Evidently\nRace's story had moved him profoundly.\n\nSuddenly conscious of our scrutiny, he turned abruptly and\ndisappeared.\n\n\"Do you know who that is?\" asked Anne Beddingfeld abruptly.\n\n\"That's my other secretary,\" I explained. \"Mr. Rayburn. He's been\nseedy up to now.\"\n\nShe toyed with the bread by her plate.\n\n\"Has he been your secretary long?\"\n\n\"Not very long,\" I said cautiously.\n\nBut caution is useless with a woman, the more you hold back, the\nmore she presses forward. Anne Beddingfeld made no bones about it.", "\"How long?\" she asked bluntly.\n\n\"Well--er--I engaged him just before I sailed. Old friend of mine\nrecommended him.\"\n\nShe said nothing more, but relapsed into a thoughtful silence. I\nturned to Race with the feeling that it was my turn to display an\ninterest in his story.\n\n\"Who is Sir Laurence's next of kin, Race? Do you know?\"\n\n\"I should say so,\" he replied, with a smile. \"I am!\"\n\n_(Anne's Narrative Resumed)_\n\n\nIt was on the night of the Fancy Dress dance that I decided that\nthe time had come for me to confide in some one. So far I had\nplayed a lone hand and rather enjoyed it. Now suddenly everything\nwas changed. I distrusted my own judgment and for the first time\na feeling of loneliness and desolation crept over me.\n\nI sat on the edge of my bunk, still in my gipsy dress, and\nconsidered the situation. I thought first of Colonel Race. He had\nseemed to like me. He would be kind, I was sure. And he was no\nfool. Yet, as I thought it over, I wavered. He was a man of\ncommanding personality. He would take the whole matter out of my\nhands. And it was _my_ mystery! There were other reasons, too,\nwhich I would hardly acknowledge to myself, but which made it\ninadvisable to confide in Colonel Race.\n\nThen I thought of Mrs. Blair. She, too, had been kind to me. I did\nnot delude myself into the belief that that really meant anything.\nIt was probably a mere whim of the moment. All the same, I had it\nin my power to interest her. She was a woman who had experienced\nmost of the ordinary sensations of life. I proposed to supply her\nwith an extraordinary one! And I liked her; liked her ease of\nmanner, her lack of sentimentality, her freedom from any form of\naffectation.\n\nMy mind was made up. I decided to seek her out then and there. She\nwould hardly be in bed yet.\n\nThen I remembered that I did not know the number of her cabin.", "My\nfriend, the night stewardess, would probably know. I rang the bell.\nAfter some delay it was answered by a man. He gave me the\ninformation I wanted. Mrs. Blair's cabin was No. 71. He apologized\nfor the delay in answering the bell, but explained that he had all\nthe cabins to attend to.\n\n\"Where is the stewardess, then?\" I asked.\n\n\"They all go off duty at ten o'clock.\"\n\n\"No--I mean the night stewardess.\"\n\n\"No stewardess on at night, miss.\"\n\n\"But--but a stewardess came the other night--about one o'clock.\"\n\n\"You must have been dreaming, miss. There's no stewardess on duty\nafter ten.\"\n\nHe withdrew and I was left to digest this morsel of information.\nWho was the woman who had come to my cabin on the night of the\n22nd? My face grew graver as I realized the cunning and audacity\nof my unknown antagonists. Then, pulling myself together, I left\nmy own cabin and sought that of Mrs. Blair. I knocked at the door.\n\n\"Who's that?\" called her voice from within.\n\n\"It's me--Anne Beddingfeld.\"\n\n\"Oh, come in, Gipsy girl.\"\n\nI entered. A good deal of scattered clothing lay about, and Mrs.\nBlair herself was draped in one of the loveliest kimonos I had ever\nseen. It was all orange and gold and black and made my mouth water\nto look at it.\n\n\"Mrs. Blair,\" I said abruptly, \"I want to tell you the story of my\nlife--that is, if it isn't too late, and you won't be bored.\"\n\n\"Not a bit. I always hate going to bed,\" said Mrs. Blair, her face\ncrinkling into smiles in the delightful way it had. \"And I should\nlove to hear the story of your life. You're a most unusual creature,\nGipsy girl. Nobody else would think of bursting in on me at 1 a.m.\nto tell me the story of their life. Especially after snubbing my\nnatural curiosity for weeks as you have done! I'm not accustomed\nto being snubbed. It's been quite a pleasing novelty. Sit down on\nthe sofa and unburden your soul.\"\n\nI told her the whole story.", "It took some time as I was conscientious\nover all the details. She gave a deep sigh when I had finished,\nbut she did not say at all what I had expected her to say. Instead\nshe looked at me, laughed a little and said:\n\n\"Do you know, Anne, you're a very unusual girl? Haven't you ever\nhad qualms?\"\n\n\"Qualms?\" I asked, puzzled.\n\n\"Yes, qualms, qualms, qualms! Starting off alone with practically\nno money. What will you do when you find yourself in a strange\ncountry with all your money gone?\"\n\n\"It's no good bothering about that until it comes. I've got plenty\nof money still. The twenty-five pounds that Mrs. Flemming gave me\nis practically intact, and then I won the sweep yesterday. That's\nanother fifteen pounds. Why, I've got _lots_ of money. Forty\npounds!\"\n\n\"Lots of money! My God!\" murmured Mrs. Blair. _\"I_ couldn't do it,\nAnne, and I've plenty of pluck in my own way. I couldn't start off\ngaily with a few pounds in my pocket and no idea as to what I was\ndoing and where I was going.\"\n\n\"But that's the fun of it,\" I cried, thoroughly roused. \"It gives\none such a splendid feeling of adventure.\"\n\nShe looked at me, nodded once or twice, and then smiled.\n\n\"Lucky Anne! There aren't many people in the world who feel as you\ndo.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said impatiently, \"what do you think of it all, Mrs.\nBlair?\"\n\n\"I think it's the most thrilling thing I ever heard! Now, to begin\nwith, you will stop calling me Mrs. Blair. Suzanne will be ever so\nmuch better. Is that agreed?\"\n\n\"I should love it, Suzanne.\"\n\n\"Good girl. Now let's get down to business. You say that in Sir\nEustace's secretary--not that long-faced Pagett, the other one--you\nrecognized the man who was stabbed and came into your cabin for\nshelter?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"That gives us two links connecting Sir Eustace with the tangle.\nThe woman was murdered in _his_ house, and it's _his_ secretary\nwho gets stabbed at the mystic hour of one o'clock. I don't suspect\nSir Eustace himself, but it can't be all coincidence.", "There's a\nconnection somewhere even if he himself is unaware of it.\"\n\n\"Then there's the queer business of the stewardess,\" she continued\nthoughtfully. \"What was she like?\"\n\n\"I hardly noticed her. I was so excited and strung up--and a\nstewardess seemed such an anticlimax. But--yes--I did think her face\nwas familiar. Of course it would be if I'd seen her about the\nship.\"\n\n\"Her face seemed familiar to you,\" said Suzanne. \"Sure she wasn't\na man?\"\n\n\"She was very tall,\" I admitted.\n\n\"Hum. Hardly Sir Eustace, I should think, nor Mr. Pagett----Wait!\"\n\nShe caught up a scrap of paper and began drawing feverishly. She\ninspected the result with her head poised on one side.\n\n\"A very good likeness of the Rev. Edward Chichester. Now for the\netceteras.\" She passed the paper over to me. \"Is that your\nstewardess?\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" I cried. \"Suzanne, how clever of you!\"\n\nShe disdained the compliment with a light gesture.\n\n\"I've always had suspicions of that Chichester creature. Do you\nremember how he dropped his coffee-cup and turned a sickly green\nwhen we were discussing Crippen the other day?\"\n\n\"And he tried to get Cabin 17!\"\n\n\"Yes, it all fits in so far. But what does it all _mean?_ What was\nreally meant to happen at one o'clock in Cabin 17? It can't be the\nstabbing of the secretary. There would be no point in timing that\nfor a special hour on a special day in a special place. No, it must\nhave been some kind of appointment and he was on his way to keep\nit when they knifed him. But who was the appointment with? Certainly\nnot with you. It might have been with Chichester. Or it might have\nbeen with Pagett.\"\n\n\"That seems unlikely,\" I objected, \"they can see each other any\ntime.\"\n\nWe both sat silent for a minute or two, then Suzanne started off\non another tack.\n\n\"Could there have been anything hidden in the cabin?\"\n\n\"That seems more probable,\" I agreed. \"It would explain my things\nbeing ransacked the next morning. But there was nothing hidden\nthere, I'm sure of it.\"", "\"The young man couldn't have slipped something into a drawer the\nnight before?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"I should have seen him.\"\n\n\"Could it have been your precious piece of paper they were looking\nfor?\"\n\n\"It might have been, but it seems rather senseless. It was only a\ntime and a date--and they were both past by then.\"\n\nSuzanne nodded.\n\n\"That's so of course. No, it wasn't the paper. By the way, have\nyou got it with you? I'd rather like to see it.\"\n\nI had brought the paper with me as Exhibit A, and I handed it over\nto her. She scrutinized it, frowning.\n\n\"There's a dot after the 17. Why isn't there a dot after the 1\ntoo?\"\n\n\"There's a space,\" I pointed out.\n\n\"Yes, there's a space, but----\"\n\nSuddenly she rose and peered at the paper, holding it as close\nunder the light as possible. There was a repressed excitement in\nher manner.\n\n\"Anne, that isn't a dot! That's a flaw in the paper! A flaw in the\npaper, you see? So you've got to ignore it, and just go by the\nspaces--the spaces!\"\n\nI had risen and was standing by her. I read out the figures as I\nnow saw them.\n\n\"1 71 22.\"\n\n\"You see,\" said Suzanne, \"it's the same, but not quite. It's one\no'clock still, and the 22nd--but it's Cabin 71! _My_ cabin, Anne!\"\n\nWe stood staring at each other, so pleased with our new discovery\nand so rapt with excitement that you might have thought we had\nsolved the whole mystery. Then I fell to earth with a bump.\n\n\"But, Suzanne, nothing happened here at one o'clock on the 22nd?\"\n\nHer face fell also. \"No--it didn't.\"\n\nAnother idea struck me.\n\n\"This isn't your own cabin, is it, Suzanne? I mean not the one you\noriginally booked?\"\n\n\"No, the purser changed me into it.\"\n\n\"I wonder if it was booked before sailing for some one--some one\nwho didn't turn up. I suppose we could find out.\"\n\n\"We don't need to find out, Gipsy girl,\" cried Suzanne. \"I know!\nThe purser was telling me about it.", "The cabin was booked in the\nname of Mrs. Grey--but it seems that Mrs. Grey was merely a pseudonym\nfor the famous Madame Nadina. She's a celebrated Russian dancer,\nyou know. She's never appeared in London, but Paris has been quite\nmad about her. She had a terrific success there all through the\nWar. A thoroughly bad lot, I believe, but most attractive. The\npurser expressed his regrets that she wasn't on board in a most\nheart-felt fashion when he gave me her cabin, and then Colonel Race\ntold me a lot about her. It seems there were very queer stories\nafloat in Paris. She was suspected of espionage, but they couldn't\nprove anything. I rather fancy Colonel Race was over there simply\non that account. He's told me some very interesting things. There\nwas a regular organized gang, not German in origin at all. In fact\nthe head of it, a man always referred to as 'the Colonel' was\nthought to be an Englishman, but they never got any clue as to his\nidentity. But there is no doubt that he controlled a considerable\norganization of international crooks. Robberies, espionages,\nassaults, he undertook them all--and usually provided an innocent\nscapegoat to pay the penalty. Diabolically clever, he must have\nbeen! This woman was supposed to be one of his agents, but they\ncouldn't get hold of anything to go upon. Yes, Anne, we're on the\nright tack. Nadina is just the woman to be mixed up in this\nbusiness. The appointment on the morning of the 22nd was with her\nin this cabin. But where is she? Why didn't she sail?\"\n\nA light flashed upon me.\n\n\"She meant to sail,\" I said slowly.\n\n\"Then why didn't she?\"\n\n_\"Because she was dead._ Suzanne, Nadina was the woman murdered at\nMarlow!\"\n\nMy mind went back to the bare room in the empty house, and there\nswept over me again that indefinable sensation of menace and evil.\nWith it came the memory of the falling pencil and the discovery of\nthe roll of films. A roll of films--that struck a more recent note.", "Where had I heard of a roll of films? And why did I connect that\nthought with Mrs. Blair?\n\nSuddenly I flew at her and almost shook her in my excitement.\n\n\"Your films! The ones that were passed to you through the\nventilator? Wasn't that on the 22nd?\"\n\n\"The ones I lost?\"\n\n\"How do you know they were the same? Why would any one return them\nto you that way--in the middle of the night? It's a mad idea.\nNo--they were a message, the films had been taken out of the yellow\ntin case, and something else put inside. Have you got it still?\"\n\n\"I may have used it. No, here it is. I remember I tossed it into\nthe rack at the side of the bunk.\"\n\nShe held it out to me.\n\nIt was an ordinary round tin cylinder, such as films are packed in\nfor the tropics. I took it with trembling hand, but even as I did\nso my heart leapt. It was noticeably heavier than it should have\nbeen.\n\nWith shaking fingers I peeled off the strip of adhesive plaster\nthat kept it air-tight. I pulled off the lid, and a stream of dull\nglassy pebbles rolled onto the bed.\n\n\"Pebbles,\" I said, keenly disappointed.\n\n\"Pebbles?\" cried Suzanne.\n\nThe ring in her voice excited me.\n\n\"Pebbles? No, Anne, not pebbles! _Diamonds!\"_\n\nDiamonds!\n\nI stared, fascinated, at the glassy heap on the bunk. I picked up\none which, but for the weight, might have been a fragment of broken\nbottle.\n\n\"Are you sure, Suzanne?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, my dear. I've seen rough diamonds too often to have any\ndoubts. They're beauties too, Anne--and some of them are unique, I\nshould say. There's a history behind these.\"\n\n\"The history we heard to-night,\" I cried.\n\n\"You mean----?\"\n\n\"Colonel Race's story. It can't be a coincidence. He told it for\na purpose.\"\n\n\"To see its effect, you mean?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Its effect on Sir Eustace?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nBut, even as I said it, a doubt assailed me. _Was_ it Sir Eustace\nwho had been subjected to a test, or had the story been told for\n_my_ benefit?", "I remembered the impression I had received on that\nformer night of having been deliberately \"pumped.\" For some reason\nor other, Colonel Race was suspicious. But where did he come in?\nWhat possible connection could he have with the affair?\n\n\"Who _is_ Colonel Race?\" I asked.\n\n\"That's rather a question,\" said Suzanne. \"He's pretty well known\nas a big-game hunter, and, as you heard him say to-night, he was\na distant cousin of Sir Laurence Eardsley. I've never actually met\nhim until this trip. He journeys to and from Africa a good deal.\nThere's a general idea that he does Secret Service work. I don't\nknow whether it's true or not. He's certainly rather a mysterious\ncreature.\"\n\n\"I suppose he came into a lot of money as Sir Laurence Eardsley's\nheir?\"\n\n\"My dear Anne, he must be _rolling._ You know, he'd be a splendid\nmatch for you.\"\n\n\"I can't have a good go at him with you aboard the ship,\" I said,\nlaughing. \"Oh, these married women!\"\n\n\"We do have a pull,\" murmured Suzanne complacently. \"And everybody\nknows that I am absolutely devoted to Clarence--my husband, you\nknow. It's so safe and pleasant to make love to a devoted wife.\"\n\n\"It must be very nice for Clarence to be married to some one like\nyou.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm wearing to live with! Still, he can always escape to\nthe Foreign Office, where he fixes his eyeglass in his eye, and\ngoes to sleep in a big arm-chair. We might cable him to tell us\nall he knows about Race. I love sending cables. And they annoy\nClarence so. He always says a letter would have done as well. I\ndon't suppose he'd tell us anything, though. He is so frightfully\ndiscreet. That's what makes him so hard to live with for long on\nend. But let us go on with our matchmaking. I'm sure Colonel Race\nis very attracted to you, Anne. Give him a couple of glances from\nthose wicked eyes of yours, and the deed is done. Every one gets\nengaged on board ship. There's nothing else to do.\"", "\"I don't want to get married.\"\n\n\"Don't you?\" said Suzanne. \"Why not? I love being married--even to\nClarence!\"\n\nI disdained her flippancy.\n\n\"What I want to know is,\" I said with determination, \"what has\nColonel Race got to do with this? He's in it somewhere.\"\n\n\"You don't think it was mere chance, his telling that story?\"\n\n\"No, I don't,\" I said decidedly. \"He was watching us all narrowly.\nYou remember, _some_ of the diamonds were recovered, not all.\nPerhaps these are the missing ones--or perhaps----\"\n\n\"Perhaps what?\"\n\nI did not answer directly.\n\n\"I should like to know,\" I said, \"what became of the other young\nman. Not Eardsley but--what was his name?--Lucas!\"\n\n\"We're getting some light on the thing, anyway. It's the diamonds\nall these people are after. It must have been to obtain possession\nof the diamonds that 'The Man in the Brown Suit' killed Nadina.\"\n\n\"He didn't kill her,\" I said sharply.\n\n\"Of course he killed her. Who else could have done so?\"\n\n\"I don't know. But I'm sure he didn't kill her.\"\n\n\"He went into that house three minutes after her and came out as\nwhite as a sheet.\"\n\n\"Because he found her dead.\"\n\n\"But nobody else went in.\"\n\n\"Then the murderer was in the house already, or else he got in some\nother way. There's no need for him to pass the lodge, he could have\nclimbed over the wall.\"\n\nSuzanne glanced at me sharply.\n\n\"'The Man in the Brown Suit,'\" she mused. \"Who was he, I wonder?\nAnyway, he was identical with the 'doctor' in the Tube. He would\nhave had time to remove his make-up and follow the woman to Marlow.\nShe and Carton were to have met there, they both had an order to\nview the same house, and if they took such elaborate precautions\nto make their meeting appear accidental they must have suspected\nthey were being followed. All the same, Carton did _not_ know that\nhis shadower was the 'Man in the Brown Suit.' When he recognized\nhim, the shock was so great that he lost his head completely and\nstepped back onto the line.", "That all seems pretty clear, don't you\nthink so, Anne?\"\n\nI did not reply.\n\n\"Yes, that's how it was. He took the paper from the dead man, and\nin his hurry to get away he dropped it. Then he followed the woman\nto Marlow. What did he do when he left there, when he had killed\nher--or, according to you, found her dead. Where did he go?\"\n\nStill I said nothing.\n\n\"I wonder, now,\" said Suzanne musingly. \"Is it possible that he\ninduced Sir Eustace Pedler to bring him on board as his secretary?\nIt would be a unique chance of getting safely out of England, and\ndodging the hue and cry. But how did he square Sir Eustace? It\nlooks as though he had some hold over him.\"\n\n\"Or over Pagett,\" I suggested in spite of myself.\n\n\"You don't seem to like Pagett, Anne. Sir Eustace says he's a most\ncapable and hard-working young man. And, really, he may be for all\nwe know against him. Well, to continue my surmises. Rayburn is the\n'Man in the Brown Suit.' He had read the paper he dropped.\nTherefore, misled by the dot as you were, he attempts to reach\nCabin 17 at one o'clock on the 22nd, having previously tried to\nget possession of the cabin through Pagett. On the way there\nsomebody knifes him----\"\n\n\"Who?\" I interpolated.\n\n\"Chichester. Yes, it all fits in. Cable to Lord Nasby that you have\nfound 'The Man in the Brown Suit,' and your fortune's made, Anne!\"\n\n\"There are several things you've overlooked.\"\n\n\"What things? Rayburn's got a scar, I know--but a scar can be faked\neasily enough. He's the right height and build. What's the\ndescription of a head with which you pulverized them at Scotland\nYard?\"\n\nI trembled. Suzanne was a well-educated, well-read woman, but I\nprayed that she might not be conversant with technical terms of\nanthropology.\n\n\"Dolichocephalic,\" I said lightly.\n\nSuzanne looked doubtful.\n\n\"Was that it?\"\n\n\"Yes. Long-headed, you know. A head whose width is less than 75\nper cent. of its length,\" I explained fluently.", "There was a pause. I was just beginning to breathe freely when\nSuzanne said suddenly:\n\n\"What's the opposite?\"\n\n\"What do you mean--the opposite?\"\n\n\"Well, there must be an opposite. What do you call the heads whose\nbreadth is more than 75 per cent. of their length.\"\n\n\"Brachycephalic,\" I murmured unwillingly.\n\n\"That's it. I thought that was what you said.\"\n\n\"Did I? It was a slip of the tongue. I meant dolichocephalic,\" I\nsaid with all the assurance I could muster.\n\nSuzanne looked at me searchingly.  Then she laughed.\n\n\"You lie very well, Gipsy girl. But it will save time and trouble\nnow if you tell me all about it.\"\n\n\"There's nothing to tell,\" I said unwillingly.\n\n\"Isn't there?\" said Suzanne gently.\n\n\"I suppose I shall have to tell you,\" I said slowly. \"I'm not\nashamed of it. You can't be ashamed of something that just--happens\nto you. That's what he did. He was detestable--rude and ungrateful--but\nthat I think I understand. It's like a dog that's been chained\nup--or badly treated--it'll bite anybody. That's what he was\nlike--bitter and snarling. I don't know why I care--but I do. I care\nhorribly. Just seeing him has turned my whole life upside-down. I\nlove him. I want him. I'll walk all over Africa barefoot till I\nfind him, and I'll make him care for me. I'd die for him. I'd work\nfor him, slave for him, steal for him, even beg or borrow for him!\nThere--now you know!\"\n\nSuzanne looked at me for a long time.\n\n\"You're very un-English, Gipsy girl,\" she said at last. \"There's\nnot a scrap of the sentimental about you. I've never met any one\nwho was at once so practical and so passionate. I shall never care\nfor any one like that--mercifully for me--and yet--and yet I envy you,\nGipsy girl. It's something to be able to care. Most people can't.\nBut what a mercy for your little doctor man that you didn't marry\nhim. He doesn't sound at all the sort of individual who would enjoy\nkeeping high explosive in the house!", "So there's to be no cabling\nto Lord Nasby?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"And yet you believe him to be innocent?\"\n\n\"I also believe that innocent people can be hanged.\"\n\n\"Hm! yes. But, Anne dear, you can face facts, face them now. In\nspite of all you say, he may have murdered this woman.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"He didn't.\"\n\n\"That's sentiment.\"\n\n\"No, it isn't. He might have killed her. He may even have followed\nher there with that idea in his mind. But he wouldn't take a bit\nof black cord and strangle her with it. If he'd done it, he would\nhave strangled her with his bare hands.\"\n\nSuzanne gave a little shiver. Her eyes narrowed appreciatively.\n\n\"Hm! Anne, I am beginning to see why you find this young man of\nyours so attractive!\"\n\nI got an opportunity of tackling Colonel Race on the following\nmorning. The auction of the sweep had just been concluded, and we\nwalked up and down the deck together.\n\n\"How's the gipsy this morning? Longing for land and her caravan?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"Now that the sea is behaving so nicely, I feel I should like to\nstay on it for ever and ever.\"\n\n\"What enthusiasm!\"\n\n\"Well, isn't it lovely this morning?\"\n\nWe leant together over the rail. It was a glassy calm. The sea\nlooked as though it had been oiled. There were great patches of\ncolour on it, blue, pale green, emerald, purple and deep orange,\nlike a cubist picture. There was an occasional flash of silver that\nshowed the flying fish. The air was moist and warm, almost sticky.\nIts breath was like a perfumed caress.\n\n\"That was a very interesting story you told us last night,\" I said,\nbreaking the silence.\n\n\"Which one?\"\n\n\"The one about the diamonds.\"\n\n\"I believe women are always interested in diamonds.\"\n\n\"Of course we are. By the way, what became of the other young man?\nYou said there were two of them.\"\n\n\"Young Lucas? Well, of course, they couldn't prosecute one without\nthe other, so he went scot-free too.\"\n\n\"And what happened to him--eventually, I mean.", "Does any one know?\"\n\nColonel Race was looking straight ahead of him out to sea. His face\nwas as devoid of expression as a mask, but I had an idea that he\ndid not like my questions. Nevertheless, he replied readily enough:\n\n\"He went to the War and acquitted himself bravely. He was reported\nMissing and Wounded--believed killed.\"\n\nThat told me what I wanted to know. I asked no more. But more than\never I wondered how much Colonel Race knew. The part he was playing\nin all this puzzled me.\n\nOne other thing I did. That was to interview the night steward.\nWith a little financial encouragement, I soon got him to talk.\n\n\"The lady wasn't frightened, was she, miss? It seemed a harmless\nsort of joke. A bet, or so I understood.\"\n\nI got it all out of him, little by little. On the voyage from Cape\nTown to England one of the passengers had handed him a roll of\nfilms with instructions that they were to be dropped onto the bunk\nin Cabin 71 at 1 a.m. on January 22nd on the outward journey. A\nlady would be occupying the cabin, and the affair was described as\na bet. I gathered that the steward had been liberally paid for his\npart in the transaction. The lady's name had not been mentioned.\nOf course, as Mrs. Blair went straight into Cabin 71, interviewing\nthe purser as soon as she got on board, it never occurred to the\nsteward that she was not the lady in question. The name of the\npassenger who had arranged the transaction was Carton, and his\ndescription tallied exactly with that of the man killed on the\nTube.\n\nSo one mystery, at all events, was cleared up, and the diamonds\nwere obviously the key to the whole situation.\n\nThose last days on the _Kilmorden_ seemed to pass very quickly. As\nwe drew nearer and nearer to Cape Town, I was forced to consider\ncarefully my future plans. There were so many people I wanted to\nkeep an eye on. Mr. Chichester, Sir Eustace and his secretary,\nand--yes, Colonel Race!", "What was I to do about it? Naturally it was\nChichester who had first claim on my attention. Indeed, I was on\nthe point of reluctantly dismissing Sir Eustace and Mr. Pagett from\ntheir position of suspicious characters, when a chance conversation\nawakened fresh doubts in my mind.\n\nI had not forgotten Mr. Pagett's incomprehensible emotion at the\nmention of Florence. On the last evening on board we were all\nsitting on deck and Sir Eustace addressed a perfectly innocent\nquestion to his secretary. I forget exactly what it was, something\nto do with railway delays in Italy, but at once I noticed that Mr.\nPagett was displaying the same uneasiness which had caught my\nattention before. When Sir Eustace claimed Mrs. Blair for a dance,\nI quickly moved into the chair next to the secretary. I was\ndetermined to get to the bottom of the matter.\n\n\"I have always longed to go to Italy,\" I said. \"And especially to\nFlorence. Didn't you enjoy it very much there?\"\n\n\"Indeed I did, Miss Beddingfeld. If you will excuse me, there is\nsome correspondence of Sir Eustace's that----\"\n\nI took hold of him firmly by his coat sleeve.\n\n\"Oh, you mustn't run away!\" I cried with the skittish accent of an\nelderly dowager. \"I'm sure Sir Eustace wouldn't like you to leave\nme alone with no one to talk to. You never seem to want to talk\nabout Florence. Oh, Mr. Pagett, I believe you have a guilty secret!\"\n\nI still had my hand on his arm, and I could feel the sudden start\nhe gave.\n\n\"Not at all, Miss Beddingfeld, not at all,\" he said earnestly. \"I\nshould be only too delighted to tell you all about it, but there\nreally are some cables----\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Pagett, what a thin pretence. I shall tell Sir Eustace----\"\n\nI got no further. He gave another jump. The man's nerves seemed in\na shocking state.\n\n\"What is it you want to know?\"\n\nThe resigned martyrdom of his tone made me smile inwardly.\n\n\"Oh, everything! The pictures, the olive trees----\"\n\nI paused, rather at a loss myself.", "\"I suppose you speak Italian?\" I resumed.\n\n\"Not a word, unfortunately. But of course, with hall porters\nand--er--guides.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" I hastened to reply. \"And which was your favourite\npicture?\"\n\n\"Oh, er--the Madonna--er--Raphael, you know.\"\n\n\"Dear old Florence,\" I murmured sentimentally. \"So picturesque on\nthe banks of the Arno. A beautiful river. And the Duomo, you\nremember the Duomo?\"\n\n\"Of course, of course.\"\n\n\"Another beautiful river, is it not?\" I hazarded. \"Almost more\nbeautiful than the Arno?\"\n\n\"Decidedly so, I should say.\"\n\nEmboldened by the success of my little trap, I proceeded further.\nBut there was little room for doubt. Mr. Pagett delivered himself\ninto my hands with every word he uttered. The man had never been\nin Florence in his life.\n\nBut, if not in Florence, where had he been? In England? Actually\nin England at the time of the Mill House Mystery? I decided on a\nbold step.\n\n\"The curious thing is,\" I said, \"that I fancied I had seen you\nbefore somewhere. But I must be mistaken--since you were in Florence\nat the time. And yet----\"\n\nI studied him frankly. There was a hunted look in his eyes. He\npassed his tongue over his dry lips.\n\n\"Where--er--where----\"\n\n\"--did I think I had seen you?\" I finished for him. \"At Marlow. You\nknow Marlow? Why, of course, how stupid of me, Sir Eustace has a\nhouse there!\"\n\nBut with an incoherent muttered excuse, my victim rose and fled.\n\nThat night I invaded Suzanne's cabin, alight with excitement.\n\n\"You see, Suzanne,\" I urged, as I finished my tale, \"he was in\nEngland, in Marlow, at the time of the murder. Are you so sure now\nthat 'The Man in the Brown Suit' is guilty.\"\n\n\"I'm sure of one thing,\" said Suzanne, twinkling unexpectedly.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"That 'The Man in the Brown Suit' is better looking than poor Mr.\nPagett. No, Anne, don't get cross. I was only teasing. Sit down\nhere. Joking apart, I think you've made a very important discovery.\nUp till now, we've considered Pagett as having an alibi. Now we\nknow he hasn't.\"", "\"Exactly,\" I said. \"We must keep an eye on him.\"\n\n\"As well as everybody else,\" she said ruefully. \"Well, that's one\nof the things I wanted to talk to you about. That--and finance. No,\ndon't stick your nose in the air. I know you are absurdly proud\nand independent, but you've got to listen to horse sense over this.\nWe're partners--I wouldn't offer you a penny because I liked you,\nor because you're a friendless girl--what I want is a thrill, and\nI'm prepared to pay for it. We're going into this together\nregardless of expense. To begin with you'll come with me to the\nMount Nelson Hotel at my expense, and we'll plan out our campaign.\"\n\nWe argued the point. In the end I gave in. But I didn't like it.\nI wanted to do the thing on my own.\n\n\"That's settled,\" said Suzanne at last, getting up and stretching\nherself with a big yawn. \"I'm exhausted with my own eloquence. Now\nthen, let us discuss our victims. Mr. Chichester is going on to\nDurban. Sir Eustace is going to the Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town\nand then up to Rhodesia. He's going to have a private car on the\nrailway, and in a moment of expansion, after his fourth glass of\nchampagne the other night, he offered me a place in it. I dare say\nhe didn't really mean it, but, all the same, he can't very well\nback out if I hold him to it.\"\n\n\"Good,\" I approved. \"You keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Pagett,\nand I take on Chichester. But what about Colonel Race?\"\n\nSuzanne looked at me queerly.\n\n\"Anne, you can't possibly suspect----\"\n\n\"I do. I suspect everybody. I'm in the mood when one looks round\nfor the most unlikely person.\"\n\n\"Colonel Race is going to Rhodesia too,\" said Suzanne thoughtfully.\n\"If we could arrange for Sir Eustace to invite him also----\"\n\n\"You can manage it. You can manage anything.\"\n\n\"I love butter,\" purred Suzanne.\n\nWe parted on the understanding that Suzanne should employ her\ntalents to the best advantage.", "I felt too excited to go to bed immediately. It was my last night\non board. Early to-morrow morning we should be in Table Bay.\n\nI slipped up on deck. The breeze was fresh and cool. The boat was\nrolling a little in the choppy sea. The decks were dark and\ndeserted. It was after midnight.\n\nI leaned over the rail, watching the phosphorescent trail of foam.\nAhead of us lay Africa, we were rushing towards it through the dark\nwater. I felt alone in a wonderful world. Wrapped in a strange\npeace, I stood there, taking no heed of time, lost in a dream.\n\nAnd suddenly I had a curious intimate premonition of danger. I had\nheard nothing, but I swung round instinctively. A shadowy form had\ncrept up behind me. As I turned, it sprang. One hand gripped my\nthroat, stifling any cry I might have uttered. I fought desperately,\nbut I had no chance. I was half choking from the grip on my throat,\nbut I bit and clung and scratched in the most approved feminine\nfashion. The man was handicapped by having to keep me from crying\nout. If he had succeeded in reaching me unawares it would have been\neasy enough for him to sling me overboard with a sudden heave. The\nsharks would have taken care of the rest.\n\nStruggle as I would, I felt myself weakening. My assailant felt it\ntoo. He put out all his strength. And then, running on swift\nnoiseless feet, another shadow joined in. With one blow of his\nfist, he sent my opponent crashing headlong to the deck. Released,\nI fell back against the rail, sick and trembling.\n\nMy rescuer turned to me with a quick movement.\n\n\"You're hurt!\"\n\nThere was something savage in his tone--a menace against the person\nwho had dared to hurt me. Even before he spoke I had recognized\nhim. It was my man--the man with the scar.\n\nBut that one moment in which his attention had been diverted to me\nhad been enough for the fallen enemy. Quick as a flash he had risen\nto his feet and taken to his heels down the deck.", "With an oath\nRayburn sprang after him.\n\nI always hate being out of things. I joined the chase--a bad third.\nRound the deck we went to the starboard side of the ship. There by\nthe saloon door lay the man in a crumpled heap. Rayburn was bending\nover him.\n\n\"Did you hit him again?\" I called breathlessly.\n\n\"There was no need,\" he replied grimly. \"I found him collapsed by\nthe door. Or else he couldn't get it open and is shamming. We'll\nsoon see about that. And we'll see who he is too.\"\n\nWith a beating heart I drew near. I had realized at once that my\nassailant was a bigger man than Chichester. Anyway, Chichester was\na flabby creature who might use a knife at a pinch, but who would\nhave little strength in his bare hands.\n\nRayburn struck a match. We both uttered an ejaculation. The man\nwas Guy Pagett.\n\nRayburn appeared absolutely stupefied by the discovery.\n\n\"Pagett,\" he muttered. \"My God, Pagett.\"\n\nI felt a slight sense of superiority.\n\n\"You seem surprised.\"\n\n\"I am,\" he said heavily. \"I never suspected----\" He wheeled suddenly\nround on me. \"And you? You're not? You recognized him, I suppose,\nwhen he attacked you?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't. All the same, I'm not so very surprised.\" He stared\nat me suspiciously.\n\n\"Where do you come in, I wonder? And how much do you know?\"\n\nI smiled.\n\n\"A good deal, Mr.--er--Lucas!\"\n\nHe caught my arm, the unconscious strength of his grip made me\nwince.\n\n\"Where did you get that name?\" he asked hoarsely.\n\n\"Isn't it yours?\" I demanded sweetly. \"Or do you prefer to be\ncalled 'The Man in the Brown Suit'?\"\n\nThat did stagger him. He released my arm and fell back a pace or\ntwo.\n\n\"Are you a girl or a witch?\" he breathed.\n\n\"I'm a friend.\" I advanced a step towards him. \"I offered you my\nhelp once--I offer it again. Will you have it?\"\n\nThe fierceness of his answer took me aback.\n\n\"No. I'll have no truck with you or with any woman. Do your\ndamnedest.\"", "As before, my own temper began to rise.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" I said, \"you don't realize how much in my power you are?\nA word from me to the Captain----\"\n\n\"Say it,\" he sneered. Then advancing with a quick step: \"And whilst\nwe're realizing things, my girl, do you realize that you're in _my_\npower this minute? I could take you by the throat like this.\" With\na swift gesture he suited the action to the word. I felt his two\nhands clasp my throat and press--ever so little. \"Like this--and\nsqueeze the life out of you! And then--like our unconscious friend\nhere, but with more success--fling your dead body to the sharks.\nWhat do you say to that?\"\n\nI said nothing. I laughed. And yet I knew that the danger was real.\nJust at that moment he hated me. But I knew that I loved the\ndanger, loved the feeling of his hands on my throat. That I would\nnot have exchanged that moment for any other moment in my life. .\n. .\n\nWith a short laugh he released me.\n\n\"What's your name?\" he asked abruptly.\n\n\"Anne Beddingfeld.\"\n\n\"Does nothing frighten you, Anne Beddingfeld?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" I said, with an assumption of coolness I was far from\nfeeling. \"Wasps, sarcastic women, very young men, cockroaches, and\nsuperior shop assistants.\"\n\nHe gave the same short laugh as before. Then he stirred the\nunconscious form of Pagett with his feet.\n\n\"What shall we do with this junk? Throw it overboard?\" he asked\ncarelessly.\n\n\"If you like,\" I answered with equal calm.\n\n\"I admire your whole-hearted, blood-thirsty instincts, Miss\nBeddingfeld. But we will leave him to recover at his leisure. He\nis not seriously hurt.\"\n\n\"You shrink from a second murder, I see,\" I said sweetly.\n\n\"A second murder?\"\n\nHe looked genuinely puzzled.\n\n\"The woman at Marlow,\" I reminded him, watching the effect of my\nwords closely.\n\nAn ugly brooding expression settled down on his face. He seemed to\nhave forgotten my presence.\n\n\"I might have killed her,\" he said. \"Sometimes I believe that I\nmeant to kill her. . . .\"\n\nA wild rush of feeling, hatred of the dead woman, surged through\nme.", "_I_ could have killed her that moment, had she stood before\nme. . . . For he must have loved her once--he must--he must--to have\nfelt like that!\n\nI regained control of myself and spoke in my normal voice:\n\n\"We seem to have said all there is to be said--except good night.\"\n\n\"Good night and good-bye, Miss Beddingfeld.\"\n\n\"Au revoir, Mr. Lucas.\"\n\nAgain he flinched at the name. He came nearer.\n\n\"Why do you say that--au revoir, I mean?\"\n\n\"Because I have a fancy that we shall meet again.\"\n\n\"Not if I can help it!\"\n\nEmphatic as his tone was, it did not offend me. On the contrary I\nhugged myself with secret satisfaction. I am not quite a fool.\n\n\"All the same,\" I said gravely, \"I think we shall.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nI shook my head, unable to explain the feeling that had actuated\nmy words.\n\n\"I never wish to see you again,\" he said suddenly and violently.\n\nIt was really a very rude thing to say, but I only laughed softly\nand slipped away into the darkness.\n\nI heard him start after me, and then pause, and a word floated down\nthe deck. I think it was a \"witch\"!\n\n  _(Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)_\n\n\n  Mount Nelson Hotel,\n\n  Cape Town.\n\nIt is really the greatest relief to get off the _Kilmorden._\n\nThe whole time that I was on board I was conscious of being\nsurrounded by a network of intrigue. To put the lid on everything,\nGuy Pagett must needs engage in a drunken brawl the last night. It\nis all very well to explain it away, but that is what it actually\namounts to. What else would you think if a man comes to you with\na lump the size of an egg on the side of his head and an eye\ncoloured all the tints of the rainbow?\n\nOf course Pagett would insist on trying to be mysterious about the\nwhole thing. According to him, you would think his black eye was\nthe direct result of his devotion to my interests. His story was\nextraordinarily vague and rambling, and it was a long time before\nI could make head or tail of it.", "To begin with, it appears he caught sight of a man behaving\nsuspiciously. Those are Pagett's words. He has taken them straight\nfrom the pages of a German Spy Story. What he means by a man\nbehaving suspiciously he doesn't know himself. I said so to him.\n\n\"He was slinking along in a very furtive manner, and it was the\nmiddle of the night, Sir Eustace.\"\n\n\"Well, what were you doing yourself? Why weren't you in bed and\nasleep like a good Christian?\" I demanded irritably.\n\n\"I had been coding those cables of yours, Sir Eustace, and typing\nthe diary up to date.\"\n\nTrust Pagett to be always in the right and a martyr over it!\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I just thought I would have a look around before turning in, Sir\nEustace. The man was coming down the passage from your cabin. I\nthought at once there was something wrong by the way he looked\nabout him. He slunk up the stairs by the saloon. I followed him.\n\n\"My dear Pagett,\" I said, \"why shouldn't the poor chap go on deck\nwithout having his footsteps dogged? Lots of people even sleep on\ndeck--very uncomfortable, I've always thought. The sailors wash you\ndown with the rest of the deck at five in the morning.\" I shuddered\nat the idea.\n\n\"Anyway,\" I continued, \"if you went worrying some poor devil who\nwas suffering from insomnia, I don't wonder he landed you one.\"\n\nPagett looked patient.\n\n\"If you would hear me out, Sir Eustace. I was convinced the man\nhad been prowling about near your cabin where he had no business\nto be. The only two cabins down that passage are yours and Colonel\nRace's.\"\n\n\"Race,\" I said, lighting a cigar carefully, \"can look after himself\nwithout your assistance, Pagett.\" I added as an afterthought: \"So\ncan I.\"\n\nPagett came nearer and breathed heavily as he always does before\nimparting a secret.\n\n\"You see, Sir Eustace, I fancied--and now indeed I am sure--it was\nRayburn.\"\n\n\"Rayburn?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir Eustace.\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"Rayburn has far too much sense to attempt to wake me up in the\nmiddle of the night.\"", "\"Quite so, Sir Eustace. I think it was Colonel Race he went to see.\nA secret meeting--for orders!\"\n\n\"Don't hiss at me, Pagett,\" I said, drawing back a little, \"and do\ncontrol your breathing. Your idea is absurd. Why should they want\nto have a secret meeting in the middle of the night? If they'd\nanything to say to each other, they could hob-nob over beef-tea in\na perfectly casual and natural manner.\"\n\nI could see that Pagett was not in the least convinced.\n\n_\"Something_ was going on last night, Sir Eustace,\" he urged, \"or\nwhy should Rayburn assault me so brutally.\"\n\n\"You're quite sure it was Rayburn?\"\n\nPagett appeared to be perfectly convinced of that. It was the only\npart of the story that he wasn't vague about.\n\n\"There's something very queer about all this,\" he said. \"To begin\nwith, where _is_ Rayburn?\"\n\nIt's perfectly true that we haven't seen the fellow since we came\non shore. He did not come up to the hotel with us. I decline to\nbelieve that he is afraid of Pagett, however.\n\nAltogether the whole thing is very annoying. One of my secretaries\nhas vanished into the blue, and the other looks like a disreputable\nprize-fighter. I can't take him about with me in his present\ncondition. I shall be the laughing-stock of Cape Town. I have an\nappointment later in the day to deliver old Milray's _billet-doux,_\nbut I shall not take Pagett with me. Confound the fellow and his\nprowling ways.\n\nAltogether I am decidedly out of temper. I had poisonous breakfast\nwith poisonous people. Dutch waitresses with thick ankles who took\nhalf an hour to bring me a bad bit of fish. And this farce of\ngetting up at 5 a.m. on arrival at the port to see a blinking\ndoctor and hold your hands above your head simply makes me tired.\n\n_Later._\n\nA very serious thing has occurred. I went to my appointment with\nthe Prime Minister, taking Milray's sealed letter. It didn't look\nas though it had been tampered with, but inside was a blank sheet\nof paper!", "Now, I suppose, I'm in the devil of a mess. Why I ever let that\nbleating old fool Milray embroil me in the matter I can't think.\n\nPagett is a famous Job's comforter. He displays a certain gloomy\nsatisfaction that maddens me. Also, he has taken advantage of my\nperturbation to saddle me with the stationery trunk. Unless he is\ncareful, the next funeral he attends will be his own.\n\nHowever, in the end I had to listen to him.\n\n\"Supposing, Sir Eustace, that Rayburn had overheard a word or two\nof your conversation with Mr. Milray in the street? Remember, you\nhad no written authority from Mr. Milray. You accepted Rayburn on\nhis own valuation.\"\n\n\"You think Rayburn is a crook, then?\" I said slowly.\n\nPagett did. How far his views were influenced by resentment over\nhis black eye I don't know. He made out a pretty fair case against\nRayburn. And the appearance of the latter told against him. My idea\nwas to do nothing in the matter. A man who has permitted himself\nto be made a thorough fool of is not anxious to broadcast the fact.\n\nBut Pagett, his energy unimpaired by his recent misfortunes, was\nall for vigorous measures. He had his way of course. He bustled\nout to the police station, sent innumerable cables, and brought a\nherd of English and Dutch officials to drink whiskies and sodas at\nmy expense.\n\nWe got Milray's answer that evening. He knew nothing of my late\nsecretary! There was only one spot of comfort to be extracted from\nthe situation.\n\n\"At any rate,\" I said to Pagett, \"you weren't poisoned. You had\none of your ordinary bilious attacks.\"\n\nI saw him wince. It was my only score.\n\n_Later._\n\nPagett is in his element. His brain positively scintillates with\nbright ideas. He will have it now that Rayburn is none other than\nthe famous \"Man in the Brown Suit.\" I dare say he is right. He\nusually is. But all this is getting unpleasant. The sooner I get\noff to Rhodesia the better. I have explained to Pagett that he is\nnot to accompany me.", "\"You see, my dear fellow,\" I said, \"you must remain here on the\nspot. You might be required to identify Rayburn any minute. And,\nbesides, I have my dignity as an English Member of Parliament to\nthink of. I can't go about with a secretary who has apparently\nrecently been indulging in a vulgar street-brawl.\"\n\nPagett winced. He is such a respectable fellow that his appearance\nis pain and tribulation to him.\n\n\"But what will you do about your correspondence and the notes for\nyour speeches, Sir Eustace?\"\n\n\"I shall manage,\" I said airily.\n\n\"Your private car is to be attached to the eleven-o'clock train\nto-morrow, Wednesday, morning,\" Pagett continued. \"I have made all\narrangements. Is Mrs. Blair taking a maid with her?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Blair?\" I gasped.\n\n\"She tells me you offered her a place.\"\n\nSo I did, now I come to think of it. On the night of the Fancy\nDress ball. I even urged her to come. But I never thought she\nwould! Delightful as she is, I do not know that I want Mrs. Blair's\nsociety all the way to Rhodesia and back. Women require such a lot\nof attention. And they are confoundedly in the way sometimes.\n\n\"Have I asked any one else?\" I said nervously. One does these\nthings in moments of expansion.\n\n\"Mrs. Blair seemed to think you had asked Colonel Race as well.\"\n\nI groaned.\n\n\"I must have been very drunk if I asked Race. Very drunk indeed.\nTake my advice, Pagett, and let your black eye be a warning to you,\ndon't go on the bust again.\"\n\n\"As you know, I am a teetotaller, Sir Eustace.\"\n\n\"Much wiser to take the pledge if you have a weakness that way. I\nhaven't asked any one else, have I, Pagett?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of, Sir Eustace.\"\n\nI heaved a sigh of relief.\n\n\"There's Miss Beddingfeld,\" I said thoughtfully. \"She wants to get\nto Rhodesia to dig up bones, I believe. I've a good mind to offer\nher a temporary job as a secretary. She can typewrite, I know, for\nshe told me so.\"", "To my surprise, Pagett opposed the idea vehemently. He does not\nlike Anne Beddingfeld. Ever since the night of the black eye, he\nhas displayed uncontrollable emotion whenever she is mentioned.\nPagett is full of mysteries nowadays.\n\nJust to annoy him, I shall ask the girl. As I said before, she has\nextremely nice legs.\n\n  _(Anne's Narrative Resumed)_\n\n\nI don't suppose that as long as I live I shall forget my first\nsight of Table Mountain. I got up frightfully early and went out\non deck. I went right up to the boat deck, which I believe is a\nheinous offence, but I decided to dare something in the cause of\nsolitude. We were just steaming into Table Bay. There were fleecy\nwhite clouds hovering above Table Mountain, and nestling on the\nslopes below, right down to the sea, was the sleeping town, gilded\nand bewitched by the morning sunlight.\n\nIt made me catch my breath and have that curious hungry pain inside\nthat seizes one sometimes when one comes across something that's\nextra beautiful. I'm not very good at expressing these things, but\nI knew well enough that I had found, if only for a fleeting moment,\nthe thing that I had been looking for ever since I left Little\nHampsly. Something new, something hitherto undreamed of, something\nthat satisfied my aching hunger for romance.\n\nPerfectly silently, or so it seemed to me, the _Kilmorden_ glided\nnearer and nearer. It was still very like a dream. Like all\ndreamers, however, I could not let my dream alone. We poor humans\nare so anxious not to miss anything.\n\n\"This is South Africa,\" I kept saying to myself industriously,\n\"South Africa, South Africa. You are seeing the world. This is the\nworld. You are seeing it. Think of it, Anne Beddingfeld, you\npudding-head. You're seeing the world.\"\n\nI had thought that I had the boat deck to myself, but now I observed\nanother figure leaning over the rail, absorbed as I had been in\nthe rapidly approaching city. Even before he turned his head I knew\nwho it was. The scene of last night seemed unreal and melodramatic\nin the peaceful morning sunlight.", "What must he have thought of me?\nIt made me hot to realize the things that I had said. And I hadn't\nmeant them--or had I?\n\nI turned my head resolutely away and stared hard at Table Mountain.\nIf Rayburn had come up here to be alone, I, at least, need not\ndisturb him by advertising my presence.\n\nBut to my intense surprise I heard a light footfall on the deck\nbehind me, and then his voice, pleasant and normal:\n\n\"Miss Beddingfeld.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\nI turned.\n\n\"I want to apologize to you. I behaved like a perfect boor last\nnight.\"\n\n\"It--it was a peculiar night,\" I said hastily.\n\nIt was not a very lucid remark, but it was absolutely the only\nthing I could think of.\n\n\"Will you forgive me?\"\n\nI held out my hand without a word. He took it.\n\n\"There's something else I want to say.\" His gravity deepened. \"Miss\nBeddingfeld, you may not know it, but you are mixed up in a rather\ndangerous business.\"\n\n\"I gathered as much,\" I said.\n\n\"No, you don't. You can't possibly know. I want to warn you. Leave\nthe whole thing alone. It can't concern you really. Don't let your\ncuriosity lead you to tamper with other people's business. No,\nplease don't get angry again. I'm not speaking of myself. You've\nno idea of what you might come up against--these men will stop at\nnothing. They are absolutely ruthless. Already you're in danger--look\nat last night. They fancy you know something. Your only chance is\nto persuade them that they're mistaken. But be careful, always be\non the look out for danger, and, look here, if at any time you\nshould fall into their hands, don't try and be clever--tell the\nwhole truth, it will be your only chance.\"\n\n\"You make my flesh creep, Mr. Rayburn,\" I said, with some truth.\n\"Why do you take the trouble to warn me?\"\n\nHe did not answer for some minutes, then he said in a low voice:\n\n\"It may be the last thing I can do for you. Once on shore I shall\nbe all right--but I may not get on shore.\"", "\"What?\" I cried.\n\n\"You see, I'm afraid you're not the only person on board who knows\nthat I am 'The Man in the Brown Suit.'\"\n\n\"If you think that I told----\" I said hotly.\n\nHe reassured me with a smile.\n\n\"I don't doubt you, Miss Beddingfeld. If I ever said I did, I lied.\nNo, but there's one person on board who's known all along. He's\nonly got to speak--and my number's up. All the same, I'm taking a\nsporting chance that he won't speak.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because he's a man who likes playing a lone hand. And when the\npolice have got me I should be of no further use to him. Free, I\nmight be! Well, an hour will show.\"\n\nHe laughed rather mockingly, but I saw his face harden. If he had\ngambled with Fate, he was a good gambler. He could lose and smile.\n\n\"In any case,\" he said lightly, \"I don't suppose we shall meet\nagain.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said slowly. \"I suppose not.\"\n\n\"So--good-bye.\"\n\n\"Good-bye.\"\n\nHe gripped my hand hard, just for a minute his curious light eyes\nseemed to burn into mine, then he turned abruptly and left me. I\nheard his footsteps ringing along the deck. They echoed and\nre-echoed. I felt that I should hear them always. Footsteps--going\nout of my life.\n\nI can admit frankly that I did not enjoy the next two hours. Not\ntill I stood on the wharf, having finished with most of the\nridiculous formalities that bureaucracies require, did I breathe\nfreely once more. No arrest had been made, and I realized that it\nwas a heavenly day, and that I was extremely hungry. I joined\nSuzanne. In any case, I was staying the night with her at the\nhotel. The boat did not go on to Port Elizabeth and Durban until\nthe following morning. We got into a taxi and drove to the Mount\nNelson.\n\nIt was all heavenly. The sun, the air, the flowers! When I thought\nof Little Hampsly in January, the mud knee-deep, and the\nsure-to-be-falling rain, I hugged myself with delight.", "Suzanne was\nnot nearly so enthusiastic. She has travelled a great deal of\ncourse. Besides, she is not the type that gets excited before\nbreakfast. She snubbed me severely when I let out an enthusiastic\nyelp at the sight of a giant blue convolvulus.\n\nBy the way, I should like to make it clear here and now that this\nstory will not be a story of South Africa. I guarantee no genuine\nlocal colour--you know the sort of thing--half a dozen words in\nitalics on every page. I admire it very much, but I can't do it.\nIn South Sea Islands, of course, you make an immediate reference\nto _beche-de-mer._ I don't know what _beche-de-mer_ is, I never\nhave known, I probably never shall know. I've guessed once or twice\nand guessed wrong. In South Africa I know you at once begin to talk\nabout a _stoep_--I do know what a _stoep_ is--it's the thing round\na house and you sit on it. In various other parts of the world you\ncall it a veranda, a piazza, and a ha-ha. Then again, there are\npawpaws. I had often read of pawpaws. I discovered at once what\nthey were, because I had one plumped down in front of me for\nbreakfast. I thought at first that it was a melon gone bad. The\nDutch waitress enlightened me, and persuaded me to use lemon juice\nand sugar and try again. I was very pleased to meet a pawpaw. I\nhad always vaguely associated it with a _hula-hula,_ which, I\nbelieve, though I may be wrong, is a kind of straw skirt that\nHawaiian girls dance in. No, I think I am wrong--that is a\n_lava-lava._\n\nAt any rate, all these things are very cheering after England. I\ncan't help thinking that it would brighten our cold Island life if\none could have a breakfast of _bacon-bacon,_ and then go out clad\nin a _jumper-jumper_ to pay the books.\n\nSuzanne was a little tamer after breakfast. They had given me a\nroom next to hers with a lovely view right out over Table Bay.", "I\nlooked at the view whilst Suzanne hunted for some special\nface-cream. When she had found it and started an immediate\napplication, she became capable of listening to me.\n\n\"Did you see Sir Eustace?\" I asked. \"He was marching out of the\nbreakfast room as we went in. He'd had some bad fish or something\nand was just telling the head waiter what he thought about it, and\nhe bounced a peach on the floor to show how hard it was--only it\nwasn't quite as hard as he thought and it squashed.\"\n\nSuzanne smiled.\n\n\"Sir Eustace doesn't like getting up early any more than I do. But,\nAnne, did you see Mr. Pagett? I ran against him in the passage.\nHe's got a black eye. What can he have been doing?\"\n\n\"Only trying to push me overboard,\" I replied nonchalantly.\n\nIt was a distinct score for me. Suzanne left her face half anointed\nand pressed for details. I gave them to her.\n\n\"It all gets more and more mysterious,\" she cried. \"I thought I\nwas going to have the soft job sticking to Sir Eustace, and that\nyou would have all the fun with the Rev. Edward Chichester, but\nnow I'm not so sure. I hope Pagett won't push me off the train some\ndark night.\"\n\n\"I think you're still above suspicion, Suzanne. But, if the worst\nhappens, I'll wire to Clarence.\"\n\n\"That reminds me--give me a cable form. Let me see now, what shall\nI say. 'Implicated in the most thrilling mystery please send me a\nthousand pounds at once Suzanne.'\"\n\nI took the form from her, and pointed out that she could eliminate\na \"the,\" an \"a,\" and possibly, if she didn't care about being\npolite, a \"please.\" Suzanne, however, appears to be perfectly\nreckless in money matters. Instead of attending to my economical\nsuggestions, she added three words more: \"enjoying myself hugely.\"\n\nSuzanne was engaged to lunch with friends of hers, who came to the\nhotel about eleven o'clock to fetch her. I was left to my own\ndevices. I went down through the grounds of the hotel, crossed the\ntram-lines and followed a cool shady avenue right down till I came\nto the main street.", "I strolled about, seeing the sights, enjoying\nthe sunlight and the black-faced sellers of flowers and fruits. I\nalso discovered a place where they had the most delicious ice-cream\nsodas. Finally, I bought a sixpenny basket of peaches and retraced\nmy steps to the hotel.\n\nTo my surprise and pleasure I found a note awaiting me. It was from\nthe curator of the Museum. He had read of my arrival on the\n_Kilmorden,_ in which I was described as the daughter of the late\nProfessor Beddingfeld. He had known my father slightly and had had\na great admiration for him. He went on to say that his wife would\nbe delighted if I would come out and have tea with them that\nafternoon at their Villa at Muizenberg. He gave me instructions\nfor getting there.\n\nIt was pleasant to think that poor Papa was still remembered and\nhighly thought of. I foresaw that I would have to be personally\nescorted round the Museum before I left Cape Town, but I risked\nthat. To most people it would have been a treat--but one can have\ntoo much of a good thing if one is brought up on it, morning, noon\nand night.\n\nI put on my best hat (one of Suzanne's cast-offs) and my least\ncrumpled white linen and started off after lunch. I caught a fast\ntrain to Muizenberg and got there in about half an hour. It was a\nnice trip. We wound slowly round the base of Table Mountain, and\nsome of the flowers were lovely. My geography being weak, I had\nnever fully realized that Cape Town is on a peninsula, consequently\nI was rather surprised on getting out of the train to find myself\nfacing the sea once more. There was some perfectly entrancing\nbathing going on. The people had short curved boards and came\nfloating in on the waves. It was far too early to go to tea. I made\nfor the bathing pavilion, and when they said would I have a surf\nboard, I said \"Yes, please.\" Surfing looks perfectly easy.", "_It\nisn't._ I say no more. I got very angry and fairly hurled my plank\nfrom me. Nevertheless, I determined to return on the first possible\nopportunity and have another go. I would not be beaten. Quite by\nmistake I then got a good run on my board, and came out delirious\nwith happiness. Surfing is like that. You are either vigorously\ncursing or else you are idiotically pleased with yourself.\n\nI found the Villa Medgee after some little difficulty. It was right\nup on the side of the mountain, isolated from the other cottages\nand villas. I rang the bell, and a smiling Kafir boy answered it.\n\n\"Mrs. Raffini?\" I inquired.\n\nHe ushered me in, preceded me down the passage and flung open a\ndoor. Just as I was about to pass in, I hesitated. I felt a sudden\nmisgiving. I stepped over the threshold and the door swung sharply\nto behind me.\n\nA man rose from his seat behind a table and came forward with\noutstretched hand.\n\n\"So glad we have persuaded you to visit us, Miss Beddingfeld,\" he\nsaid.\n\nHe was a tall man, obviously a Dutchman, with a flaming orange\nbeard. He did not look in the least like the curator of a museum.\nIn fact, I realized in a flash that I had made a fool of myself.\n\nI was in the hands of the enemy.\n\nIt reminded me forcibly of Episode III in \"The Perils of Pamela.\"\nHow often had I not sat in the sixpenny seats, eating a twopenny\nbar of milk chocolate, and yearning for similar things to happen\nto me. Well, they had happened with a vengeance. And somehow it\nwas not nearly so amusing as I had imagined. It's all very well on\nthe screen--you have the comfortable knowledge that there's bound\nto be an Episode IV. But in real life there was absolutely no\nguarantee that Anna the Adventuress might not terminate abruptly\nat the end of any Episode.\n\nYes, I was in a tight place. All the things that Rayburn had said\nthat morning came back to me with unpleasant distinctness.", "Tell\nthe truth, he had said. Well, I could always do that, but was it\ngoing to help me? To begin with, would my story be believed? Would\nthey consider it likely or possible that I had started off on this\nmad escapade simply on the strength of a scrap of paper smelling\nof moth balls? It sounded to me a wildly incredible tale. In that\nmoment of cold sanity I cursed myself for a melodramatic idiot,\nand yearned for the peaceful boredom of Little Hampsly.\n\nAll this passed through my mind in less time than it takes to tell.\nMy first instinctive movement was to step backwards and feel for\nthe handle of the door. My captor merely grinned.\n\n\"Here you are and here you stay,\" he remarked facetiously.\n\nI did my best to put a bold face upon the matter.\n\n\"I was invited to come here by the curator of the Cape Town Museum.\nIf I have made a mistake----\"\n\n\"A mistake? Oh, yes, a big mistake!\"\n\nHe laughed coarsely.\n\n\"What right have you to detain me? I shall inform the police----\"\n\n\"Yap, yap, yap--like a little toy dog.\" He laughed.\n\nI sat down on a chair.\n\n\"I can only conclude that you are a dangerous lunatic,\" I said\ncoldly.\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"I should like to point out to you that my friends are perfectly\nwell aware where I have gone, and that if I have not returned by\nthis evening, they will come in search of me. You understand?\"\n\n\"So your friends know where you are, do they? Which of them?\"\n\nThus challenged, I did a lightning calculation of chances. Should\nI mention Sir Eustace? He was a well-known man, and his name might\ncarry weight. But if they were in touch with Pagett, they might\nknow I was lying. Better not risk Sir Eustace.\n\n\"Mrs. Blair, for one,\" I said lightly. \"A friend of mine with whom\nI am staying.\"\n\n\"I think not,\" said my captor, slyly shaking his orange head. \"You\nhave not seen her since eleven this morning. And you received our\nnote, bidding you come here, at lunch-time.\"", "His words showed me how closely my movements had been followed,\nbut I was not going to give in without a fight.\n\n\"You are very clever,\" I said. \"Perhaps you have heard of that\nuseful invention, the telephone? Mrs. Blair called me up on it when\nI was resting in my room after lunch. I told her then where I was\ngoing this afternoon.\"\n\nTo my great satisfaction, I saw a shade of uneasiness pass over\nhis face. Clearly he had overlooked the possibility that Suzanne\nmight have telephoned to me. I wished she really had done so!\n\n\"Enough of this,\" he said harshly, rising.\n\n\"What are you going to do with me?\" I asked, still endeavouring to\nappear composed.\n\n\"Put you where you can do no harm in case your friends come after\nyou.\"\n\nFor a moment my blood ran cold, but his next words reassured me.\n\n\"To-morrow you'll have some questions to answer, and after you've\nanswered them we shall know what to do with you. And I can tell\nyou, young lady, we've more ways than one of making obstinate\nlittle fools talk.\"\n\nIt was not cheering, but it was at least a respite. I had until\nto-morrow. This man was clearly an underling obeying the orders of\na superior. Could that superior by any chance be Pagett?\n\nHe called and two Kafirs appeared. I was taken upstairs. Despite\nmy struggles, I was gagged and then bound hand and foot. The room\ninto which they had taken me was a kind of attic right under the\nroof. It was dusty and showed little signs of having been occupied.\nThe Dutchman made a mock bow and withdrew, closing the door behind\nhim.\n\nI was quite helpless. Turn and twist as I would, I could not loosen\nmy hands in the slightest degree, and the gag prevented me from\ncrying out. If, by any possible chance, any one did come to the\nhouse, I could do nothing to attract their attention. Down below\nI heard the sound of a door shutting. Evidently the Dutchman was\ngoing out.", "It was maddening not to be able to do anything. I strained again\nat my bonds, but the knots held. I desisted at last, and either\nfainted or fell asleep. When I awoke I was in pain all over. It\nwas quite dark now, and I judged that the night must be well\nadvanced, for the moon was high in the heavens and shining down\nthrough the dusty skylight. The gag was half choking me and the\nstiffness and pain were unendurable.\n\nIt was then that my eyes fell on a bit of broken glass lying in\nthe corner. A moonbeam slanted right down on it, and its glistening\nhad caught my attention. As I looked at it, an idea came into my\nhead.\n\nMy arms and legs were helpless, but surely I could still _roll._\nSlowly and awkwardly, I set myself in motion. It was not easy.\nBesides being extremely painful, since I could not guard my face\nwith my arms, it was also exceedingly difficult to keep any\nparticular direction.\n\nI tended to roll in every direction except the one I wanted to go.\nIn the end, however, I came right up against my objective. It\nalmost touched my bound hands.\n\nEven then it was not easy. It took an infinity of time before I\ncould wriggle the glass into such a position, wedged against the\nwall, that it would rub up and down on my bonds. It was a long\nheart-rending process, and I almost despaired, but in the end I\nsucceeded in sawing through the cords that bound my wrists. The\nrest was a matter of time. Once I had restored the circulation to\nmy hands by rubbing the wrists vigorously, I was able to undo the\ngag. One or two full breaths did a lot for me.\n\nVery soon I had undone the last knot, though even then it was some\ntime before I could stand on my feet, but at last I stood erect,\nswinging my arms to and fro to restore the circulation, and wishing\nabove all things that I could get hold of something to eat.", "I waited about a quarter of an hour, to be quite sure of my\nrecovered strength. Then I tiptoed noiselessly to the door. As I\nhad hoped, it was not locked, only latched. I unlatched it and\npeeped cautiously out.\n\nEverything was still. The moonlight came in through a window and\nshowed me the dusty uncarpeted staircase. Cautiously I crept down\nit. Still no sound--but as I stood on the landing below, a faint\nmurmur of voices reached me. I stopped dead and stood there for\nsome time. A clock on the wall registered the fact that it was\nafter midnight.\n\nI was fully aware of the risks I might run if I descended lower,\nbut my curiosity was too much for me. With infinite precautions I\nprepared to explore. I crept softly down the last flight of stairs\nand stood in the square hall. I looked round me--and then caught my\nbreath with a gasp. A Kafir boy was sitting by the hall door. He\nhad not seen me, indeed I soon realized by his breathing that he\nwas fast asleep.\n\nShould I retreat, or should I go on? The voices came from the room\nI had been shown into on arrival. One of them was that of my Dutch\nfriend, the other I could not for the moment recognize, though it\nseemed vaguely familiar.\n\nIn the end I decided that it was clearly my duty to hear all I\ncould. I must risk the Kafir boy waking up. I crossed the hall\nnoiselessly and knelt by the study door. For a moment or two I\ncould hear no better. The voices were louder, but I could not\ndistinguish what they said.\n\nI applied my eye to the keyhole instead of my ear. As I had guessed,\none of the speakers was the big Dutchman. The other man was sitting\noutside my circumscribed range of vision.\n\nSuddenly he rose to get himself a drink. His back, black clad and\ndecorous, came into view. Even before he turned round I knew who\nhe was.\n\nMr. Chichester!\n\nNow I began to make out the words.", "\"All the same, it is dangerous. Suppose her friends come after\nher?\"\n\nIt was the big man speaking. Chichester answered him. He had\ndropped his clerical voice entirely. No wonder I had not recognized\nit.\n\n\"All bluff. They haven't an idea where she is.\"\n\n\"She spoke very positively.\"\n\n\"I dare say. I've looked into the matter, and we've nothing to\nfear. Anyway, it's the 'Colonel's' orders. You don't want to go\nagainst them, I suppose?\"\n\nThe Dutchman ejaculated something in his own language. I judged it\nto be a hasty disclaimer.\n\n\"But why not knock her on the head?\" he growled. \"It would be\nsimple. The boat is all ready. She could be taken out to sea?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Chichester meditatively. \"That is what I should do.\nShe knows too much, that is certain. But the 'Colonel' is a man\nwho likes to play a lone hand--though no one else must do so.\"\nSomething in his own words seemed to awaken a memory that annoyed\nhim. \"He wants information of some kind from this girl.\"\n\nHe had paused before the information, and the Dutchman was quick\nto catch him up.\n\n\"Information?\"\n\n\"Something of the kind.\"\n\n\"Diamonds,\" I said to myself.\n\n\"And now,\" continued Chichester, \"give me the lists.\"\n\nFor a long time their conversation was quite incomprehensible to\nme. It seemed to deal with large quantities of vegetables. Dates\nwere mentioned, prices, and various names of places which I did\nnot know. It was quite half an hour before they had finished their\nchecking and counting.\n\n\"Good,\" said Chichester, and there was a sound as though he pushed\nback his chair. \"I will take these with me for the 'Colonel' to\nsee.\"\n\n\"When do you leave?\"\n\n\"Ten o'clock to-morrow morning will do.\"\n\n\"Do you want to see the girl before you go?\"\n\n\"No. There are strict orders that no one is to see her until the\n'Colonel' comes. Is she all right?\"\n\n\"I looked in on her when I came in for dinner. She was asleep, I\nthink. What about food?\"\n\n\"A little starvation will do no harm.", "The 'Colonel' will be here\nsome time to-morrow. She will answer questions better if she is\nhungry. No one had better go near her till then. Is she securely\ntied up?\"\n\nThe Dutchman laughed.\n\n\"What do you think?\"\n\nThey both laughed. So did I, under my breath. Then, as the sounds\nseemed to betoken that they were about to come out of the room, I\nbeat a hasty retreat. I was just in time. As I reached the head of\nthe stairs, I heard the door of the room open, and at the same time\nthe Kafir stirred and moved. My retreat by the way of the hall door\nwas not to be thought of. I retired prudently to the attic, gathered\nmy bonds round me and lay down again on the floor, in case they\nshould take it into their heads to come and look at me.\n\nThey did not do so, however. After about an hour, I crept down the\nstairs, but the Kafir by the door was awake and humming softly to\nhimself. I was anxious to get out of the house, but I did not quite\nsee how to manage it.\n\nIn the end I was forced to retreat to the attic again. The Kafir\nwas clearly on guard for the night. I remained there patiently all\nthrough the sounds of early morning preparation. The men breakfasted\nin the hall, I could hear their voices distinctly floating up the\nstairs. I was getting thoroughly unnerved. How on earth was I to\nget out of the house?\n\nI counselled myself to be patient. A rash move might spoil\neverything. After breakfast came the sounds of Chichester departing.\nTo my intense relief, the Dutchman accompanied him.\n\nI waited breathlessly. Breakfast was being cleared away, the work\nof the house was being done. At last, the various activities seemed\nto die down. I slipped out from my lair once more. Very carefully\nI crept down the stairs. The hall was empty. Like a flash I was\nacross it, had unlatched the door, and was outside in the sunshine.", "I ran down the drive like one possessed.\n\nOnce outside, I resumed a normal walk. People stared at me\ncuriously, and I do not wonder. My face and clothes must have been\ncovered in dust from rolling about in the attic. At last I came to\na garage. I went in.\n\n\"I have met with an accident,\" I explained. \"I want a car to take\nme to Cape Town at once. I must catch the boat to Durban.\"\n\nI had not long to wait. Ten minutes later I was speeding along in\nthe direction of Cape Town. I must know if Chichester was on the\nboat. Whether to sail on her myself or not, I could not determine,\nbut in the end I decided to do so. Chichester would not know that\nI had seen him in the Villa at Muizenberg. He would doubtless lay\nfurther traps for me, but I was forewarned. And he was the man I\nwas after, the man who was seeking the diamonds on behalf of the\nmysterious \"Colonel.\"\n\nAlas, for my plans! As I arrived at the docks, the _Kilmorden\nCastle_ was steaming out to sea. And I had no means of knowing\nwhether Chichester had sailed on her or not!\n\nI drove to the hotel. There was no one in the lounge that I knew.\nI ran upstairs and tapped on Suzanne's door. Her voice bade me\n\"come in.\" When she saw who it was she literally fell on my neck.\n\n\"Anne, dear, where have you been? I've been worried to death about\nyou. What have you been doing?\"\n\n\"Having adventures,\" I replied. \"Episode III of 'The Perils of\nPamela.'\"\n\nI told her the whole story. She gave vent to a deep sigh when I\nfinished.\n\n\"Why do these things always happen to you?\" she demanded plaintively.\n\"Why does no one gag me and bind me hand and foot?\"\n\n\"You wouldn't like it if they did,\" I assured her. \"To tell you\nthe truth, I'm not nearly so keen on having adventures myself as\nI was. A little of that sort of thing goes a long way.\"", "Suzanne seemed unconvinced. An hour or two of gagging and binding\nwould have changed her views quickly enough. Suzanne likes thrills,\nbut she hates being uncomfortable.\n\n\"And what are we all doing now?\" she asked.\n\n\"I don't quite know,\" I said thoughtfully. \"You still go to\nRhodesia, of course, to keep an eye on Pagett----\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\nThat was just my difficulty. Had Chichester gone on the _Kilmorden,_\nor had he not? Did he mean to carry out his original plan of going\nto Durban? The hour of his leaving Muizenberg seemed to point to\nan affirmative answer to both questions. In that case, I might go\nto Durban by train. I fancied that I should get there before the\nboat. On the other hand, if the news of my escape were wired to\nChichester, and also the information that I had left Cape Town for\nDurban, nothing was simpler for him than to leave the boat at\neither Port Elizabeth or East London and so give me the slip\ncompletely.\n\nIt was rather a knotty problem.\n\n\"We'll inquire about trains to Durban anyway,\" I said.\n\n\"And it's not too late for morning tea,\" said Suzanne. \"We'll have\nit in the lounge.\"\n\nThe Durban train left at 8.15 that evening, so they told me at the\noffice. For the moment I postponed decision and joined Suzanne for\nsomewhat belated \"eleven-o'clock tea.\"\n\n\"Do you feel that you would really recognize Chichester again--in\nany other disguise, I mean?\" asked Suzanne.\n\nI shook my head ruefully.\n\n\"I certainly didn't recognize him as the stewardess, and never\nshould have but for your drawing.\"\n\n\"The man's a professional actor, I'm sure of it,\" said Suzanne\nthoughtfully. \"His make-up is perfectly marvellous. He might come\noff the boat as a navvy or something, and you'd never spot him.\"\n\n\"You're very cheering,\" I said.\n\nAt that minute, Colonel Race stepped in through the window and came\nand joined us.\n\n\"What is Sir Eustace doing?\" asked Suzanne. \"I haven't seen him\nabout to-day.\"\n\nRather an odd expression passed over the Colonel's face.\n\n\"He's got a little trouble of his own to attend to which is keeping\nhim busy.\"", "\"Tell us about it.\"\n\n\"I mustn't tell tales out of school.\"\n\n\"Tell us something--even if you have to invent it for our special\nbenefit.\"\n\n\"Well, what would you say to the famous 'Man in the Brown Suit'\nhaving made the voyage with us?\"\n\n_\"What?\"_\n\nI felt the colour die out of my face and then surge back again.\nFortunately Colonel Race was not looking at me.\n\n\"It's a fact, I believe. Every port watched for him and he\nbamboozled Pedler into bringing him out as his secretary!\"\n\n\"Not Mr. Pagett?\"\n\n\"Oh, not Pagett--the other fellow. Rayburn, he called himself.\"\n\n\"Have they arrested him?\" asked Suzanne. Under the table she gave\nmy hand a reassuring squeeze. I waited breathlessly for an answer.\n\n\"He seems to have disappeared into thin air.\"\n\n\"How does Sir Eustace take it?\"\n\n\"Regards it as a personal insult offered him by Fate.\"\n\nAn opportunity of hearing Sir Eustace's views on the matter\npresented itself later in the day. We were awakened from a\nrefreshing afternoon nap by a page-boy with a note. In touching\nterms it requested the pleasure of our company at tea in his\nsitting-room.\n\nThe poor man was indeed in a pitiable state. He poured out his\ntroubles to us, encouraged by Suzanne's sympathetic murmurs. (She\ndoes that sort of thing very well.)\n\n\"First a perfectly strange woman has the impertinence to get\nherself murdered in my house--on purpose to annoy me, I do believe.\nWhy my house? Why, of all the houses in Great Britain, choose the\nMill House? What harm had I ever done the woman that she must needs\nget herself murdered there?\"\n\nSuzanne made one of her sympathetic noises again and Sir Eustace\nproceeded in a still more aggrieved tone.\n\n\"And, if that's not enough, the fellow who murdered her has the\nimpudence, the colossal impudence, to attach himself to me as my\nsecretary. My secretary, if you please! I'm tired of secretaries,\nI won't have any more secretaries. Either they're concealed\nmurderers or else they're drunken brawlers. Have you seen Pagett's\nblack eye? But of course you have.", "How can I go about with a\nsecretary like that? And his face is such a nasty shade of yellow\ntoo--just the colour that doesn't go with a black eye. I've done\nwith secretaries--unless I have a girl. A nice girl, with liquid\neyes, who'll hold my hand when I'm feeling cross. What about you,\nMiss Anne. Will you take on the job?\"\n\n\"How often shall I have to hold your hand?\" I asked, laughing.\n\n\"All day long,\" replied Sir Eustace gallantly.\n\n\"I shan't get much typing done at that rate,\" I reminded him.\n\n\"That doesn't matter. All this work is Pagett's idea. He works me\nto death. I'm looking forward to leaving him behind in Cape Town.\"\n\n\"He is staying behind?\"\n\n\"Yes, he'll enjoy himself thoroughly sleuthing about after Rayburn.\nThat's the sort of thing suits Pagett down to the ground. He adores\nintrigue. But I'm quite serious in my offer. Will you come? Mrs.\nBlair here is a competent chaperon, and you can have a half-holiday\nevery now and again to dig for bones.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much, Sir Eustace,\" I said cautiously, \"but I think\nI'm leaving for Durban to-night.\"\n\n\"Now don't be an obstinate girl. Remember, there are lots of lions\nin Rhodesia. You'll like lions. All girls do.\"\n\n\"Will they be practising low jumps?\" I asked, laughing. \"No, thank\nyou very much, but I must go to Durban.\"\n\nSir Eustace looked at me, sighed deeply, then opened the door of\nthe adjoining room and called to Pagett.\n\n\"If you've quite finished your afternoon sleep, my dear fellow,\nperhaps you'd do a little work for change.\"\n\nGuy Pagett appeared in the doorway. He bowed to us both, starting\nslightly at the sight of me, and replied in a melancholy voice:\n\n\"I have been typing that memorandum all this afternoon, Sir\nEustace.\"\n\n\"Well, stop typing it then. Go down to the Trade Commissioner's\nOffice, or the Board of Agriculture, or the Chamber of Mines, or\none of these places, and ask them to lend me some kind of a woman\nto take to Rhodesia.", "She must have liquid eyes and not object to\nmy holding her hand.\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir Eustace. I will ask for a competent short-hand-typist.\"\n\n\"Pagett's a malicious fellow,\" said Sir Eustace, after the secretary\nhad departed. \"I'd be prepared to bet that he'll pick out some\nslab-faced creature on purpose to annoy me. She must have nice feet\ntoo--I forgot to mention that.\"\n\nI clutched Suzanne excitedly by the hand and almost dragged her\nalong to her room.\n\n\"Now, Suzanne,\" I said, \"we've got to make plans--and make them\nquickly. Pagett is staying behind here--you heard that?\"\n\n\"Yes. I suppose that means that I shan't be allowed to go to\nRhodesia--which is very annoying, because I _want_ to go to Rhodesia.\nHow tiresome.\"\n\n\"Cheer up,\" I said. \"You're going all right. I don't see how you\ncould back out at the last moment without its appearing frightfully\nsuspicious. And, besides, Pagett might suddenly be summoned by Sir\nEustace, and it would be far harder for you to attach yourself to\nhim for the journey up.\"\n\n\"It would hardly be respectable,\" said Suzanne, dimpling. \"I should\nhave to pretend a fatal passion for him as an excuse.\"\n\n\"On the other hand, if you were there when he arrived, it would\nall be perfectly simple and natural. Besides, I don't think we\nought to lose sight of the other two entirely.\"\n\n\"Oh, Anne, you surely can't suspect Colonel Race or Sir Eustace?\"\n\n\"I suspect everybody,\" I said darkly, \"and if you've read any\ndetective stories, Suzanne, you must know that it's always the most\nunlikely person who's the villain. Lots of criminals have been\ncheerful fat men like Sir Eustace.\"\n\n\"Colonel Race isn't particularly fat--or particularly cheerful\neither.\"\n\n\"Sometimes they're lean and saturnine,\" I retorted. \"I don't say\nI seriously suspect either of them, but, after all, the woman was\nmurdered in Sir Eustace's house----\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, we needn't go over all that again. I'll watch him for\nyou, Anne, and if he gets any fatter and any more cheerful, I'll\nsend you a telegram at once.", "'Sir E. swelling. Highly suspicious.\nCome at once.'\"\n\n\"Really, Suzanne,\" I cried, \"you seem to think all this is a game!\"\n\n\"I know I do,\" said Suzanne, unabashed. \"It seems like that. It's\nyour fault, Anne. I've got imbued with your 'Let's have an\nadventure' spirit. It doesn't seem a bit real. Dear me, if Clarence\nknew that I was running about Africa tracking dangerous criminals,\nhe'd have a fit.\"\n\n\"Why don't you cable him about it?\" I asked sarcastically.\n\nSuzanne's sense of humour always fails her when it comes to sending\ncables. She considered my suggestion in perfectly good faith.\n\n\"I might. It would have to be a very long one.\" Her eyes brightened\nat the thought. \"But I think it's better not. Husbands always want\nto interfere with perfectly harmless amusements.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, summing up the situation, \"you will keep an eye on\nSir Eustace and Colonel Race----\"\n\n\"I know why I've got to watch Sir Eustace,\" interrupted Suzanne,\n\"because of his figure and his humorous conversation. But I think\nit's carrying it rather far to suspect Colonel Race, I do indeed.\nWhy, he's something to do with the Secret Service. Do you know,\nAnne, I believe the best thing we could do would be to confide in\nhim and tell him the whole story.\"\n\nI objected vigorously to this unsporting proposal. I recognized in\nit the disastrous effects of matrimony. How often have I not heard\na perfectly intelligent female say, in the tone of one clinching\nan argument, _\"Edgar_ says----\" And all the time you are perfectly\naware that Edgar is a perfect fool. Suzanne, by reason of her\nmarried state, was yearning to lean upon some man or other.\n\nHowever, she promised faithfully that she would not breathe a word\nto Colonel Race, and we went on with our plan-making.\n\n\"It's quite clear that I must stay here and watch Pagett, and this\nis the best way to do it. I must pretend to leave for Durban this\nevening, take my luggage down and so on, but really I shall go to\nsome small hotel in the town.", "I can alter my appearance a\nlittle--wear a fair toupee and one of those thick white lace veils,\nand I shall have a much better chance of seeing what he's really\nat if he thinks I'm safely out of the way.\"\n\nSuzanne approved this plan heartily. We made due and ostentatious\npreparations, inquiring once more about the departure of the train\nat the office and packing my luggage.\n\nWe dined together in the restaurant. Colonel Race did not appear,\nbut Sir Eustace and Pagett were at their table in the window.\nPagett left the table half-way through the meal, which annoyed me,\nas I had planned to say goodbye to him. However, doubtless Sir\nEustace would do as well. I went over to him when I had finished.\n\n\"Good-bye, Sir Eustace,\" I said. \"I'm off to-night to Durban.\"\n\nSir Eustace sighed heavily.\n\n\"So I heard. You wouldn't like me to come with you, would you?\"\n\n\"I should love it.\"\n\n\"Nice girl. Sure you won't change your mind and come and look for\nlions in Rhodesia?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.\"\n\n\"He must be a very handsome fellow,\" said Sir Eustace plaintively.\n\"Some young whipper-snapper in Durban, I suppose, who puts my\nmature charms completely in the shade. By the way, Pagett's going\ndown in the car in a minute or two. He could take you to the\nstation.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, thank you,\" I said hastily. \"Mrs. Blair and I have got\nour own taxi ordered.\"\n\nTo go down with Guy Pagett was the last thing I wanted! Sir Eustace\nlooked at me attentively.\n\n\"I don't believe you like Pagett. I don't blame you. Of all the\nofficious, interfering asses--going about with the air of a martyr,\nand doing everything he can to annoy and upset me!\"\n\n\"What has he done now?\" I inquired with some curiosity.\n\n\"He's got hold of a secretary for me. You never saw such a woman!\nForty, if she's a day, wears pince-nez and sensible boots and an\nair of brisk efficiency that will be the death of me. A regular\nslab-faced woman.\"", "\"Won't she hold your hand?\"\n\n\"I devoutly hope not!\" exclaimed Sir Eustace. \"That would be the\nlast straw. Well, good-bye, liquid eyes. If I shoot a lion I shan't\ngive you the skin--after the base way you've deserted me.\"\n\nHe squeezed my hand warmly and we parted. Suzanne was waiting for\nme in the hall. She was to come down to see me off.\n\n\"Let's start at once,\" I said hastily, and motioned to the man to\nget a taxi.\n\nThen a voice behind me made me start:\n\n\"Excuse me, Miss Beddingfeld, but I'm just going down in a car. I\ncan drop you and Mrs. Blair at the station.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you,\" I said hastily. \"But there's no need to trouble\nyou. I----\"\n\n\"No trouble at all, I assure you. Put the luggage in, porter.\"\n\nI was helpless. I might have protested further, but a slight\nwarning nudge from Suzanne urged me to be on my guard.\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Pagett,\" I said coldly.\n\nWe all got into the car. As we raced down the road into the town,\nI racked my brains for something to say. In the end Pagett himself\nbroke the silence.\n\n\"I have secured a very capable secretary for Sir Eustace,\" he\nobserved. \"Miss Pettigrew.\"\n\n\"He wasn't exactly raving about her just now,\" I remarked.\n\nPagett looked at me coldly.\n\n\"She is a proficient shorthand-typist,\" he said repressively.\n\nWe pulled up in front of the station. Here surely he would leave\nus. I turned with outstretched hand--but no.\n\n\"I'll come and see you off. It's just eight o'clock, your train\ngoes in a quarter of an hour.\"\n\nHe gave efficient directions to porters. I stood helpless, not\ndaring to look at Suzanne. The man suspected. He was determined to\nmake sure that I did go by the train. And what could I do? Nothing.\nI saw myself, in a quarter of an hour's time, steaming out of the\nstation with Pagett planted on the platform waving me adieu. He\nhad turned the tables on me adroitly. His manner towards me had\nchanged, moreover.", "It was full of an uneasy geniality which sat\nill upon him, and which nauseated me. The man was an oily hypocrite.\nFirst he tried to murder me, and now he paid me compliments! Did\nhe imagine for one minute that I hadn't recognized him that night\non the boat? No, it was a pose, a pose which he forced me to\nacquiesce in, his tongue in his cheek all the while.\n\nHelpless as a sheep, I moved along under his expert directions. My\nluggage was piled in my sleeping compartment--I had a two-berth one\nto myself. It was twelve minutes past eight. In three minutes the\ntrain would start.\n\nBut Paggett had reckoned without Suzanne.\n\n\"It will be a terribly hot journey, Anne,\" she said suddenly.\n\"Especially going through the Karoo to-morrow. You've got some\neau-de-Cologne or lavender water with you, haven't you?\"\n\nMy cue was plain.\n\n\"Oh, dear,\" I cried. \"I left my eau-de-Cologne on the dressing-table\nat the hotel.\"\n\nSuzanne's habit of command served her well. She turned imperiously\nto Pagett.\n\n\"Mr. Pagett. Quick. You've just time. There's a chemist almost\nopposite the station. Anne must have some eau-de-Cologne.\"\n\nHe hesitated, but Suzanne's imperative manner was too much for him.\nShe is a born autocrat. He went. Suzanne followed him with her eyes\ntill he disappeared.\n\n\"Quick, Anne, get out the other side--in case he hasn't really gone,\nbut is watching us from the end of the platform. Never mind your\nluggage. You can telegraph about that to-morrow. Oh, if only the\ntrain starts on time!\"\n\nI opened the gate on the opposite side to the platform and climbed\ndown. Nobody was observing me. I could just see Suzanne standing\nwhere I had left her, looking up at the train and apparently\nchatting to me at the window. A whistle blew, the train began to\ndraw out. Then I heard feet racing furiously up the platform. I\nwithdrew to the shadow of a friendly bookstall and watched.\n\nSuzanne turned from waving her handkerchief to the retreating\ntrain.", "\"Too late, Mr. Pagett,\" she said cheerfully. \"She's gone. Is that\nthe eau-de-Cologne? What a pity we didn't think of it sooner!\"\n\nThey passed not far from me on their way out of the station. Guy\nPagett was extremely hot. He had evidently run all the way to the\nchemist and back.\n\n\"Shall I get you a taxi, Mrs. Blair?\"\n\nSuzanne did not fail in her role.\n\n\"Yes, please. Can't I give you a lift back? Have you much to do\nfor Sir Eustace? Dear me, I wish Anne Beddingfeld was coming with\nus to-morrow. I don't like the idea of a young girl like that\ntravelling off to Durban all by herself. But she was set upon it.\nSome little attraction there, I fancy----\"\n\nThey passed out of ear-shot. Clever Suzanne. She had saved me.\n\nI allowed a minute or two to elapse and then I too made my way out\nof the station, almost colliding as I did so with a man--an\nunpleasant-looking man with a nose disproportionately big for his\nface.\n\nI had no further difficulty in carrying out my plans. I found a\nsmall hotel in a back street, got a room there, paid a deposit as\nI had no luggage with me, and went placidly to bed.\n\nOn the following morning I was up early and went out into the town\nto purchase a modest wardrobe. My idea was to do nothing until\nafter the departure of the eleven-o'clock train to Rhodesia with\nmost of the party on board. Pagett was not likely to indulge in\nany nefarious activities until he had got rid of them. Accordingly\nI took a tram out of the town and proceeded to enjoy a country\nwalk. It was comparatively cool, and I was glad to stretch my legs\nafter the long voyage and my close confinement at Muizenberg.\n\nA lot hinges on small things. My shoe-lace came untied, and I\nstopped to do it up. The road had just turned a corner, and as I\nwas bending over the offending shoe a man came right round and\nalmost walked into me.", "He lifted his hat, murmuring an apology,\nand went on. It struck me at the time that his face was vaguely\nfamiliar, but at the moment I thought no more of it. I looked at\nmy wrist-watch. The time was getting on. I turned my feet in the\ndirection of Cape Town.\n\nThere was a tram on the point of going and I had to run for it. I\nheard other footsteps running behind me. I swung myself on and so\ndid the other runner. I recognized him at once. It was the man who\nhad passed me on the road when my shoe came untied, and in a flash\nI knew why his face was familiar. It was the small man with the\nbig nose whom I had run into on leaving the station the night\nbefore.\n\nThe coincidence was rather startling. Could it be possible that\nthe man was deliberately following me? I resolved to test that as\npromptly as possible. I rang the bell and got off at the next stop.\nThe man did not get off. I withdrew into the shadow of a shop\ndoorway and watched. He alighted at the next stop and walked back\nin my direction.\n\nThe case was clear enough. I was being followed. I had crowed too\nsoon. My victory over Guy Pagett took on another aspect. I hailed\nthe next tram and, as I expected, my shadower also got on. I gave\nmyself up to some very serious thinking.\n\nIt was perfectly apparent that I had stumbled on a bigger thing\nthan I knew. The murder in the house at Marlow was not an isolated\nincident committed by a solitary individual. I was up against a\ngang, and, thanks to Colonel Race's revelations to Suzanne, and\nwhat I had overheard at the house at Muizenberg, I was beginning\nto understand some of its manifold activities. Systematized crime,\norganized by the man known to his followers as the \"Colonel\"! I\nremembered some of the talk I had heard on board ship, of the\nstrike on the Rand and the causes underlying it--and the belief that\nsome secret organization was at work fomenting the agitation.", "That\nwas the \"Colonel's\" work, his emissaries were acting according to\nplan. He took no part in these things himself, I had always heard,\nas he limited himself to directing and organizing. The brain-work--not\nthe dangerous labour--for him. But still it well might be that he\nhimself was on the spot, directing affairs from an apparently\nimpeccable position.\n\nThat, then, was the meaning of Colonel Race's presence on the\n_Kilmorden Castle._ He was out after the arch-criminal. Everything\nfitted in with that assumption. He was some one high up in the\nSecret Service whose business it was to lay the \"Colonel\" by the\nheels.\n\nI nodded to myself--things were becoming very clear to me. What of\nmy part in the affair? Where did I come in? Was it only diamonds\nthey were after? I shook my head. Great as the value of the diamonds\nmight be, they hardly accounted for the desperate attempts which\nhad been made to get me out of the way. No, I stood for more than\nthat. In some way, unknown to myself, I was a menace, a danger!\nSome knowledge that I had, or that they thought I had, made them\nanxious to remove me at all costs--and that knowledge was bound up\nsomehow with the diamonds. There was one person, I felt sure, who\ncould enlighten me--if he would! The Man in the Brown Suit--Harry\nRayburn. He knew the other half of the story. But he had vanished\ninto the darkness, he was a hunted creature flying from pursuit.\nIn all probability he and I would never meet again. . . .\n\nI brought myself back with a jerk to the actualities of the moment.\nIt was no good thinking sentimentally of Harry Rayburn. He had\ndisplayed the greatest antipathy to me from the first. Or, at\nleast----There I was again--dreaming! The real problem was what to\ndo--_now!_\n\nI, priding myself upon my role of watcher, had become the watched.\nAnd I was afraid! For the first time I began to lose my nerve. I\nwas the little bit of grit that was impeding the smooth working of\nthe great machine--and I fancied that the machine would have a short\nway with little bits of grit.", "Once Harry Rayburn had saved me, once\nI had saved myself--but I felt suddenly that the odds were heavily\nagainst me. My enemies were all around me in every direction, and\nthey were closing in. If I continued to play a lone hand I was\ndoomed.\n\nI rallied myself with an effort. After all, what could they do? I\nwas in a civilized city--with policemen every few yards. I would be\nwary in future. They should not trap me again as they had done in\nMuizenberg.\n\nAs I reached this point in my meditations, the train arrived at\nAdderly Street. I got out. Undecided what to do, I walked slowly\nup the left-hand side of the street. I did not trouble to look if\nmy watcher was behind me. I knew he was. I walked into Cartwright's\nand ordered two coffee ice-cream sodas--to steady my nerves. A man,\nI suppose, would have had a stiff peg; but girls derive a lot of\ncomfort from ice-cream sodas. I applied myself to the end of the\nstraw with gusto. The cool liquid went trickling down my throat in\nthe most agreeable manner. I pushed the first glass aside empty.\n\nI was sitting on one of the little high stools in front of the\ncounter. Out of the tail of my eye, I saw my tracker come in and\nsit down unostentatiously at a little table near the door. I\nfinished the second coffee soda and demanded a maple one. I can\ndrink practically an unlimited amount of ice-cream sodas.\n\nSuddenly the man by the door got up and went out. That surprised\nme. If he was going to wait outside, why not wait outside from the\nbeginning. I slipped down from my stool and went cautiously to the\ndoor. I drew back quickly into the shadow. The man was talking to\nGuy Pagett.\n\nIf I had ever had any doubts, that would have settled it. Pagett\nhad his watch out and was looking at it. They exchanged a few brief\nwords, and then the secretary swung on down the street towards the\nstation.", "Evidently he had given his orders. But what were they?\n\nSuddenly my heart leapt into my mouth. The man who had followed me\ncrossed to the middle of the road and spoke to a policeman. He\nspoke at some length, gesticulating towards Cartwright's and\nevidently explaining something. I saw the plan at once. I was to\nbe arrested on some charge or other--pocket-picking, perhaps. It\nwould be easy enough for the gang to put through a simple little\nmatter like that. Of what good to protest my innocence? They would\nhave seen to every detail. Long ago they had brought a charge of\nrobbing De Beers against Harry Rayburn, and he had not been able\nto disprove it, though I had little doubt but that he had been\nabsolutely blameless. What chance had I against such a \"frame up\"\nas the \"Colonel\" could devise?\n\nI glanced up at the clock almost mechanically, and immediately\nanother aspect of the case struck me. I saw the point of Guy\nPagett's looking at his watch. It was just on eleven, and at eleven\nthe mail train left for Rhodesia bearing with it the influential\nfriends who might otherwise come to my rescue. That was the reason\nof my immunity up to now. From last night till eleven this morning\nI had been safe, but now the net was closing in upon me.\n\nI hurriedly opened my bag and paid for my drinks, and as I did so,\nmy heart seemed to stand still, _for inside it was a man's wallet\nstuffed with notes!_ It must have been deftly introduced into my\nhandbag as I left the tram.\n\nPromptly I lost my head. I hurried out of Cartwright's. The little\nman with the big nose and the policeman were just crossing the\nroad. They saw me, and the little man designated me excitedly to\nthe policeman. I took to my heels and ran. I judged him to be a\nslow policeman. I should get a start. But I had no plan, even then.\nI just ran for my life down Adderly Street.", "People began to stare.\nI felt that in another minute some one would stop me.\n\nAn idea flashed into my head.\n\n\"The station?\" I asked, in a breathless gasp.\n\n\"Just down on the right.\"\n\nI sped on. It is permissible to run for a train. I turned into the\nstation, but as I did so I heard footsteps close behind me. The\nlittle man with the big nose was a champion sprinter. I foresaw\nthat I should be stopped before I got to the platform I was in\nsearch of. I looked up to the clock--one minute to eleven. I might\njust do it if my plan succeeded.\n\nI had entered the station by the main entrance in Adderly Street.\nI now darted out again through the side exit. Directly opposite me\nwas the side entrance to the post office, the main entrance to\nwhich is in Adderly Street.\n\nAs I expected, my pursuer, instead of following me in, ran down\nthe street to cut me off when I emerged by the main entrance, or\nto warn the policeman to do so.\n\nIn an instant I slipped across the street again and back into the\nstation. I ran like a lunatic. It was just eleven. The long train\nwas moving as I appeared on the platform. A porter tried to stop\nme, but I wriggled myself out of his grasp and sprang upon the\nfootboard. I mounted the two steps and opened the gate. I was safe!\nThe train was gathering way.\n\nWe passed a man standing by himself at the end of the platform. I\nwaved to him.\n\n\"Good-bye, Mr. Pagett,\" I shouted.\n\nNever have I seen a man more taken aback. He looked as though he\nhad seen a ghost.\n\nIn a minute or two I was having trouble with the conductor. But I\ntook a lofty tone.\n\n\"I am Sir Eustace Pedler's secretary,\" I said haughtily. \"Please\ntake me to his private car.\"\n\nSuzanne and Colonel Race were standing on the rear observation\nplatform. They both uttered an exclamation of utter surprise at\nseeing me.", "\"Hullo, Miss Anne,\" cried Colonel Race, \"where have you turned up\nfrom? I thought you'd gone to Durban. What an unexpected person\nyou are.\"\n\nSuzanne said nothing, but her eyes asked a hundred questions.\n\n\"I must report myself to my chief,\" I said demurely. \"Where is he?\"\n\n\"He's in the office--middle compartment--dictating at an incredible\nrate to the unfortunate Miss Pettigrew.\"\n\n\"This enthusiasm for work is something new,\" I commented.\n\n\"H'm!\" said Colonel Race. \"His idea is, I think, to give her\nsufficient work to chain her to her typewriter in her own\ncompartment for the rest of the day.\"\n\nI laughed. Then, followed by the other two, I sought out Sir\nEustace. He was striding up and down the circumscribed space,\nhurling a flood of words at the unfortunate secretary whom I now\nsaw for the first time. A tall, square woman in drab clothing, with\npince-nez and an efficient air. I judged that she was finding it\ndifficult to keep pace with Sir Eustace, for her pencil was flying\nalong, and she was frowning horribly.\n\nI stepped into the compartment.\n\n\"Come aboard, sir,\" I said saucily.\n\nSir Eustace paused dead in the middle of a complicated sentence on\nthe labour situation and stared at me. Miss Pettigrew must be a\nnervous creature, in spite of her efficient air, for she jumped as\nthough she had been shot.\n\n\"God bless my soul!\" ejaculated Sir Eustace. \"What about the young\nman in Durban?\"\n\n\"I prefer you,\" I said softly.\n\n\"Darling,\" said Sir Eustace. \"You can start holding my hand at\nonce.\"\n\nMiss Pettigrew coughed, and Sir Eustace hastily withdrew his hand.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" he said. \"Let me see, where were we? Yes. Tylman Roos,\nin his speech at----What's the matter? Why aren't you taking it\ndown?\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Colonel Race gently, \"that Miss Pettigrew has\nbroken her pencil.\"\n\nHe took it from her and sharpened it. Sir Eustace stared, and so\ndid I. There was something in Colonel Race's tone that I did not\nquite understand.\n\n_(Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)_\n\n\nI am inclined to abandon my Reminiscences.", "Instead I shall write\na short article entitled \"Secretaries I have had.\" As regards\nsecretaries, I seem to have fallen under a blight. At one minute\nI have no secretaries, at another I have too many. At the present\nminute I am journeying to Rhodesia with a pack of women. Race goes\noff with the two best-looking, of course, and leaves me with the\ndud. That is what always happens to me--and, after all, this is _my_\nprivate car, not Race's.\n\nAlso Anne Beddingfeld is accompanying me to Rhodesia on the pretext\nof being my temporary secretary. But all this afternoon she has\nbeen out on the observation platform with Race exclaiming at the\nbeauty of the Hex River Pass. It is true that I told her her\nprincipal duty would be to hold my hand. But she isn't even doing\nthat. Perhaps she is afraid of Miss Pettigrew. I don't blame her\nif so. There is nothing attractive about Miss Pettigrew--she is a\nrepellent female with large feet, more like a man than a woman.\n\nThere is something very mysterious about Anne Beddingfeld. She\njumped on board the train at the last minute, puffing like a\nsteam-engine for all the world as though she'd been running a\nrace--and yet Pagett told me that he'd seen her off to Durban last\nnight! Either Pagett has been drinking again or else the girl must\nhave an astral body.\n\nAnd she never explains. Nobody ever explains. Yes, \"Secretaries I\nhave had.\" No. 1, a murderer fleeing from justice. No. 2, a secret\ndrinker who carries on disreputable intrigues in Italy. No. 3, a\nbeautiful girl who possesses the useful faculty of being in two\nplaces at once. No. 4, Miss Pettigrew, who, I have no doubt, is\nreally a particularly dangerous crook in disguise! Probably one of\nPagett's Italian friends that he has palmed off on me. I shouldn't\nwonder if the world found some day that it had been grossly deceived\nby Pagett. On the whole, I think Rayburn was the best of the bunch.\nHe never worried me or got in my way.", "Guy Pagett has had the\nimpertinence to have the stationery trunk put in here. None of us\ncan move without falling over it.\n\nI went out on the observation platform just now, expecting my\nappearance to be greeted with hails of delight. Both the women were\nlistening spellbound to one of Race's travellers' tales. I shall\nlabel this car--not \"Sir Eustace Pedler and Party,\" but \"Colonel\nRace and Harem.\"\n\nThen Mrs. Blair must needs begin taking silly photographs. Every\ntime we went round a particularly appalling curve, as we climbed\nhigher and higher, she snapped at the engine.\n\n\"You see the point,\" she cried delightedly. \"It must be some curve\nif you can photograph the front part of the train from the back,\nand with the mountain background it will look awfully dangerous.\"\n\nI pointed out to her that no one could possibly tell it had been\ntaken from the back of the train. She looked at me pityingly.\n\n\"I shall write underneath it: 'Taken from the train. Engine going\nround a curve.'\"\n\n\"You could write that under any snapshot of a train,\" I said. Women\nnever think of these simple things.\n\n\"I'm glad we've come up here in daylight,\" cried Anne Beddingfeld.\n\"I shouldn't have seen this if I'd gone last night to Durban,\nshould I?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Colonel Race, smiling. \"You'd have waked up to-morrow\nmorning to find yourself in the Karoo, a hot, dusty desert of\nstones and rocks.\"\n\n\"I'm glad I changed my mind,\" said Anne, sighing contentedly, and\nlooking round.\n\nIt was rather a wonderful sight. The great mountains all around,\nthrough which we turned and twisted and laboured ever steadily\nupwards.\n\n\"Is this the best train in the day to Rhodesia?\" asked Anne\nBeddingfeld.\n\n\"In the day?\" laughed Race. \"Why, my dear Miss Anne, there are only\nthree trains a week. Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. Do you\nrealize that you don't arrive at the Falls until Saturday next?\"\n\n\"How well we shall know each other by that time,\" said Mrs. Blair\nmaliciously. \"How long are you going to stay at the Falls, Sir\nEustace?\"", "\"That depends,\" I said cautiously.\n\n\"On what?\"\n\n\"On how things go at Johannesburg. My original idea was to stay a\ncouple of days or so at the Falls--which I've never seen, though\nthis is my third visit to Africa--and then go on to Jo'burg and\nstudy the conditions of things on the Rand. At home, you know, I\npose as being an authority on South African politics. But from all\nI hear, Jo'burg will be a particularly unpleasant place to visit\nin about a week's time. I don't want to study conditions in the\nmidst of a raging revolution.\"\n\nRace smiled in a rather superior manner.\n\n\"I think your fears are exaggerated, Sir Eustace. There will be no\ngreat danger in Jo'burg.\"\n\nThe women immediately looked at him in the \"What a brave hero you\nare\" manner. It annoyed me intensely. I am every bit as brave as\nRace--but I lack the figure. These long, lean, brown men have it\nall their own way.\n\n\"I suppose you'll be there,\" I said coldly.\n\n\"Very possibly. We might travel together.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure that I shan't stay on at the Falls a bit,\" I answered\nnon-committally. Why is Race so anxious that I should go to Jo'burg?\nHe's got his eye on Anne, I believe. \"What are your plans, Miss\nAnne?\"\n\n\"That depends,\" she replied demurely, copying me.\n\n\"I thought you were my secretary,\" I objected.\n\n\"Oh, but I've been cut out. You've been holding Miss Pettigrew's\nhand all the afternoon.\"\n\n\"Whatever I've been doing, I can swear I've not been doing that,\"\nI assured her.\n\n_Thursday night._\n\nWe have just left Kimberley. Race was made to tell the story of\nthe diamond robbery all over again. Why are women so excited by\nanything to do with diamonds?\n\nAt last Anne Beddingfeld has shed her veil of mystery. It seems\nthat she's a newspaper correspondent. She sent an immense cable\nfrom De Aar this morning. To judge by the jabbering that went on\nnearly all night in Mrs. Blair's cabin, she must have been reading\naloud all her special articles for years to come.", "It seems that all along she's been on the track of \"The Man in the\nBrown Suit.\" Apparently she didn't spot him on the _Kilmorden_--in\nfact, she hardly had the chance, but she's now very busy cabling\nhome: \"How I journeyed out with the Murderer,\" and inventing highly\nfictitious stories of \"What he said to me,\" etc. I know how these\nthings are done. I do them myself, in my Reminiscences when Pagett\nwill let me. And of course one of Nasby's efficient staff will\nbrighten up the details still more, so that when it appears in the\n_Daily Budget_ Rayburn won't recognize himself.\n\nThe girl's clever, though. All on her own, apparently, she's\nferreted out the identity of the woman who was killed in my house.\nShe was a Russian dancer called Nadina. I asked Anne Beddingfeld\nif she was sure of this. She replied that it was merely a\ndeduction--quite in the Sherlock Holmes manner. However, I gather\nthat she had cabled it home to Nasby as a proved fact. Women have\nthese intuitions--I've no doubt that Anne Beddingfeld is perfectly\nright in her guess--but to call it a deduction is absurd.\n\nHow she ever got on the staff of the _Daily Budget_ is more than\nI can imagine. But she is the kind of young woman who does these\nthings. Impossible to withstand her. She is full of coaxing ways\nthat mask an invincible determination. Look how she has got into\nmy private car!\n\nI am beginning to have an inkling why. Race said something about\nthe police suspecting that Rayburn would make for Rhodesia. He\nmight just have got off by Monday's train. They telegraphed all\nalong the line, I presume, and no one of his description was found,\nbut that says little. He's an astute young man and he knows Africa.\nHe's probably exquisitely disguised as an old Kafir woman--and the\nsimple police continue to look for a handsome young man with a\nscar, dressed in the height of European fashion. I never did quite\nswallow that scar.\n\nAnyway, Anne Beddingfeld is on his track.", "She wants the glory of\ndiscovering him for herself and the _Daily Budget._ Young women\nare very cold-blooded nowadays. I hinted to her that it was an\nunwomanly action. She laughed at me. She assured me that did she\nrun him to earth her fortune was made. Race doesn't like it,\neither, I can see. Perhaps Rayburn is on this train. If so, we may\nall be murdered in our beds. I said so to Mrs. Blair--but she seemed\nquite to welcome the idea, and remarked that if I were murdered it\nwould be really a terrific scoop for Anne! A scoop for Anne indeed!\n\nTo-morrow we shall be going through Bechuanaland. The dust will be\natrocious. Also at every station, little Kafir children come and\nsell you quaint wooden animals that they carve themselves. Also\nmealie bowls and baskets. I am rather afraid that Mrs. Blair may\nrun amok. There is a primitive charm about these toys that I feel\nwill appeal to her.\n\n_Friday evening._\n\nAs I feared. Mrs. Blair and Anne have bought forty-nine wooden\nanimals!\n\n_(Anne's Narrative Resumed)_\n\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the journey up to Rhodesia.\n\nThere was something new and exciting to see every day. First the\nwonderful scenery of the Hex river valley, then the desolate\ngrandeur of the Karoo, and finally that wonderful straight stretch\nof line in Bechuanaland, and the perfectly adorable toys the\nnatives brought to sell. Suzanne and I were nearly left behind at\neach station--if you could call them stations. It seemed to me that\nthe train just stopped whenever it felt like it, and no sooner had\nit done so than a horde of natives materialized out of the empty\nlandscape, holding up mealie bowls and sugar canes and fur karosses\nand adorable carved wooden animals. Suzanne began at once to make\na collection of the latter. I imitated her example--most of them\ncost a \"tiki\" (threepence) and each was different. There were\ngiraffes and tigers and snakes and a melancholy looking eland and\nabsurd little black warriors. We enjoyed ourselves enormously.", "Sir Eustace tried to restrain us--but in vain. I still think it was\na miracle we were not left behind at some oasis of the line. South\nAfrican trains don't hoot or get excited when they are going to\nstart off again. They just glide quietly away, and you look up from\nyour bargaining and run for your life.\n\nSuzanne's amazement at seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town\ncan be imagined. We held an exhaustive survey of the situation on\nthe first evening out. We talked half the night.\n\nIt had become clear to me that defensive tactics must be adopted\nas well as aggressive ones. Travelling with Sir Eustace Pedler and\nhis party, I was fairly safe. Both he and Colonel Race were powerful\nprotectors, and I judged that my enemies would not wish to stir up\na hornet's nest about _my_ ears. Also, as long as I was near Sir\nEustace, I was more or less in touch with Guy Pagett--and Guy Pagett\nwas the heart of the mystery. I asked Suzanne whether in her\nopinion it was possible that Pagett himself was the mysterious\n\"Colonel.\" His subordinate position was, of course, against the\nassumption, but it had struck me once or twice that, for all his\nautocratic ways, Sir Eustace was really very much influenced by\nhis secretary. He was an easy-going man, and one whom an adroit\nsecretary might be able to twist round his little finger. The\ncomparative obscurity of his position might in reality be useful\nto him, since he would be anxious to be well out of the limelight.\n\nSuzanne, however, negatived these ideas very strongly. She refused\nto believe that Guy Pagett was the ruling spirit. The real head--the\n\"Colonel\"--was somewhere in the background and had probably been\nalready in Africa at the time of our arrival.\n\nI agreed that there was much to be said for her view, but I was\nnot entirely satisfied. For in each suspicious instance Pagett had\nbeen shown as the directing genius. It was true that his personality\nseemed to lack the assurance and decision that one would expect\nfrom a master criminal--but after all, according to Colonel Race,\nit was brain work only that this mysterious leader supplied, and\ncreative genius is often allied to a weak and timorous physical\nconstitution.", "\"There speaks the Professor's daughter,\" interrupted Suzanne, when\nI had got to this point in my argument.\n\n\"It's true, all the same. On the other hand, Pagett may be the\nGrand Vizier, so to speak, of the All Highest.\" I was silent for\na minute or two, and then went on musingly: \"I wish I knew how Sir\nEustace made his money!\"\n\n\"Suspecting him again?\"\n\n\"Suzanne, I've got into that state that I can't help suspecting\nsomebody! I don't really suspect him--but, after all, he _is_\nPagett's employer, and he _did_ own the Mill House.\"\n\n\"I've always heard that he made his money in some way he isn't\nanxious to talk about,\" said Suzanne thoughtfully. \"But that\ndoesn't necessarily mean crime--it might be tin-tacks or hair\nrestorer!\"\n\nI agreed ruefully.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Suzanne doubtfully, \"that we're not barking up\nthe wrong tree? Being led completely astray, I mean, by assuming\nPagett's complicity? Supposing that, after all, he is a perfectly\nhonest man?\"\n\nI considered that for a minute or two, then I shook my head.\n\n\"I can't believe that.\"\n\n\"After all, he has his explanations for everything.\"\n\n\"Y--es, but they're not very convincing. For instance, the night he\ntried to throw me overboard on the _Kilmorden,_ he says he followed\nRayburn up on deck and Rayburn turned and knocked him down. Now we\nknow that's not true.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Suzanne unwillingly. \"But we only heard the story at\nsecond-hand from Sir Eustace. If we'd heard it direct from Pagett\nhimself, it might have been different. You know how people always\nget a story a little wrong when they repeat it.\"\n\nI turned the thing over in my mind.\n\n\"No,\" I said at last, \"I don't see any way out. Pagett's guilty.\nYou can't get away from the fact that he tried to throw me\noverboard, and everything else fits in. Why are you so persistent\nin this new idea of yours?\"\n\n\"Because of his face?\"\n\n\"His face? But----\"\n\n\"Yes, I know what you're going to say. It's a sinister face. That's\njust it. No man with a face like that could be really sinister.", "It\nmust be a colossal joke on the part of Nature.\"\n\nI did not believe much in Suzanne's argument. I know a lot about\nNature in past ages. If she's got a sense of humour, she doesn't\nshow it much. Suzanne is just the sort of person who would clothe\nNature with all her own attributes.\n\nWe passed on to discuss our immediate plans. It was clear to me\nthat I must have some kind of standing. I couldn't go on avoiding\nexplanations for ever. The solution of all my difficulties lay\nready to my hand, though I didn't think of it for some time. The\n_Daily Budget!_ My silence or my speech could no longer affect\nHarry Rayburn. He was marked down as \"The Man in the Brown Suit\"\nthrough no fault of mine. I could help him best by seeming to be\nagainst him. The \"Colonel\" and his gang must have no suspicion that\nthere existed any friendly feeling between me and the man they had\nelected to be the scapegoat of the murder at Marlow. As far as I\nknew, the woman killed was still unidentified. I would cable to\nLord Nasby, suggesting that she was no other than the famous\nRussian dancer \"Nadina\" who had been delighting Paris for so long.\nIt seemed incredible to me that she had not been identified\nalready--but when I learnt more of the case long afterwards I saw\nhow natural it really was.\n\nNadina had never been to England during her successful career in\nParis. She was unknown to London audiences. The pictures in the\npapers of the Marlow victim were so blurred and unrecognizable that\nit is small wonder no one identified them. And, on the other hand,\nNadina had kept her intention of visiting England a profound secret\nfrom every one. The day after the murder a letter had been received\nby her manager purporting to be from the dancer, in which she said\nthat she was returning to Russia on urgent private affairs and that\nhe must deal with her broken contract as best he could.", "All this, of course, I only learned afterwards. With Suzanne's full\napproval, I sent a long cable from De Aar. It arrived at a\npsychological moment (this again, of course, I learnt afterwards).\nThe _Daily Budget_ was hard up for a sensation. My guess was\nverified and proved to be correct and the _Daily Budget_ had the\nscoop of its lifetime. \"Victim of the Mill House Murder identified\nby our special reporter.\" And so on. \"Our reporter makes voyage\nwith the murderer. 'The Man in the Brown Suit.' What he is really\nlike.\"\n\nThe main facts were, of course, cabled to the South African papers,\nbut I only read my own lengthy articles at a much later date! I\nreceived approval and full instructions by cable at Bulawayo. I\nwas on the staff of the _Daily Budget,_ and I had a private word\nof congratulation from Lord Nasby himself. I was definitely\naccredited to hunt down the murderer, and I, and only I, knew that\nthe murderer was not Harry Rayburn! But let the world think that\nit was he--best so for the present.\n\nWe arrived at Bulawayo early on Saturday morning. I was disappointed\nin the place. It was very hot, and I hated the hotel. Also Sir\nEustace was what I can only describe as thoroughly sulky. I think\nit was all our wooden animals that annoyed him--especially the big\ngiraffe. It was a colossal giraffe with an impossible neck, a mild\neye and a dejected tail. It had character. It had charm. A\ncontroversy was already arising as to whom it belonged--me or\nSuzanne. We had each contributed a tiki to its purchase. Suzanne\nadvanced the claims of seniority and the married state, I stuck to\nthe position that I had been the first to behold its beauty.\n\nIn the meantime, I must admit, it occupied a good deal of this\nthree-dimensional space of ours. To carry forty-nine wooden animals,\nall of awkward shape, and all of extremely brittle wood, is somewhat\nof a problem. Two porters were laden with a bunch of animals\neach--and one promptly dropped a ravishing group of ostriches and\nbroke their heads off.", "Warned by this, Suzanne and I carried all\nwe could, Colonel Race helped, and I pressed the big giraffe into\nSir Eustace's arms. Even the correct Miss Pettigrew did not escape,\na large hippopotamus and two black warriors fell to her share. I\nhad a feeling Miss Pettigrew didn't like me. Perhaps she fancied\nI was a bold hussy. Anyway, she avoided me as much as she could.\nAnd the funny thing was, her face seemed vaguely familiar to me,\nthough I couldn't quite place it.\n\nWe reposed ourselves most of the morning, and in the afternoon we\ndrove out to the Matoppos to see Rhodes's grave. That is to say,\nwe were to have done so, but at the last moment Sir Eustace backed\nout. He was very nearly in as bad a temper as the morning we\narrived at Cape Town--when he bounced the peaches on the floor and\nthey squashed! Evidently arriving early in the morning at places\nis bad for his temperament. He cursed the porters, he cursed the\nwaiters at breakfast, he cursed the whole hotel management, he\nwould doubtless have liked to curse Miss Pettigrew who hovered\naround with her pencil and pad, but I don't think even Sir Eustace\nwould have dared to curse Miss Pettigrew. She's just like the\nefficient secretary in a book. I only rescued our dear giraffe just\nin time. I feel Sir Eustace would have liked to dash him to the\nground.\n\nTo return to our expedition, after Sir Eustace had backed out, Miss\nPettigrew said she would remain at home in case he might want her.\nAnd at the very last minute Suzanne sent down a message to say she\nhad a headache. So Colonel Race and I drove off alone.\n\nHe is a strange man. One doesn't notice it so much in a crowd. But,\nwhen one is alone with him, the sense of his personality seems\nreally almost overpowering. He becomes more taciturn, and yet his\nsilence seems to say more than speech might do.\n\nIt was so that day that we drove to the Matoppos through the soft\nyellow brown scrub.", "Everything seemed strangely silent--except our\ncar which I should think was the first Ford ever made by man! The\nupholstery of it was torn to ribbons and, though I know nothing\nabout engines, even I could guess that all was not as it should be\nin its interior.\n\nBy and by the character of the country changed. Great boulders\nappeared, piled up into fantastic shapes. I felt suddenly that I\nhad got into a primitive era. Just for a moment Neanderthal men\nseemed quite as real to me as they had to Papa. I turned to Colonel\nRace.\n\n\"There must have been giants once,\" I said dreamily. \"And their\nchildren were just like children are to-day--they played with\nhandfuls of pebbles, piling them up and knocking them down, and\nthe more cleverly they balanced them, the better pleased they were.\nIf I were to give a name to this place I should call it 'The\nCountry of Giant Children.'\"\n\n\"Perhaps you're nearer the mark than you know,\" said Colonel Race\ngravely. \"Simple, primitive, big--that is Africa.\"\n\nI nodded appreciatively.\n\n\"You love it, don't you?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes. But to live in it long--well, it makes one what you would call\ncruel. One comes to hold life and death very lightly.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, thinking of Harry Rayburn. He had been like that\ntoo. \"But not cruel to weak things?\"\n\n\"Opinions differ as to what are and are not 'weak things,' Miss\nAnne.\"\n\nThere was a note of seriousness in his voice which almost startled\nme. I felt that I knew very little really of this man at my side.\n\n\"I meant children and dogs, I think.\"\n\n\"I can truthfully say I've never been cruel to children or dogs.\nSo you don't class women as 'weak things'?\"\n\nI considered.\n\n\"No, I don't think I do--though they are, I suppose. That is, they\nare nowadays. But Papa always said that in the beginning men and\nwomen roamed the world together, equal in strength--like lions and\ntigers----\"\n\n\"And giraffes?\" interpolated Colonel Race slyly.\n\nI laughed. Every one makes fun of that giraffe.", "\"And giraffes. They were nomadic, you see. It wasn't till they\nsettled down in communities, and women did one kind of thing and\nmen another that women got weak. And of course, underneath, one is\nstill the same--one _feels_ the same, I mean, and that is why women\nworship physical strength in men--it's what they once had and have\nlost.\"\n\n\"Almost ancestor worship, in fact?\"\n\n\"Something of the kind.\"\n\n\"And you really think that's true? That women worship strength, I\nmean?\"\n\n\"I think it's quite true--if one's honest. You think you admire\nmoral qualities, but when you fall in love, you revert to the\nprimitive where the physical is all that counts. But I don't think\nthat's the end--if you lived in primitive conditions it would be\nall right, but you don't--and so, in the end, the other thing wins\nafter all. It's the things that are apparently conquered that\nalways do win, isn't it? They win in the only way that counts. Like\nwhat the Bible says about losing your soul and finding it.\"\n\n\"In the end,\" said Colonel Race thoughtfully, \"you fall in love--and\nyou fall out of it, is that what you mean?\"\n\n\"Not exactly, but you can put it that way if you like.\"\n\n\"But I don't think you've ever fallen out of love, Miss Anne?\"\n\n\"No, I haven't,\" I admitted frankly.\n\n\"Or fallen in love, either?\"\n\nI did not answer.\n\nThe car drew up at our destination and brought the conversation to\na close. We got out and began the slow ascent to the World's View.\nNot for the first time, I felt a slight discomfort in Colonel\nRace's company. He veiled his thoughts so well behind those\nimpenetrable black eyes.\n\nHe frightened me a little. He had always frightened me. I never\nknew where I stood with him.\n\nWe climbed in silence till we reached the spot where Rhodes lies\nguarded by giant boulders. A strange eerie place, far from the\nhaunts of men, that sings a ceaseless paean of rugged beauty.\n\nWe sat there for some time in silence.", "Then descended once more,\nbut diverging slightly from the path. Sometimes it was a rough\nscramble and once we came to a sharp slope or rock that was almost\nsheer.\n\nColonel Race went first, then turned to help me.\n\n\"Better lift you,\" he said suddenly, and swung me off my feet with\na quick gesture.\n\nI felt the strength of him as he set me down and released his\nclasp. A man of iron, with muscles like taut steel. And again, I\nfelt afraid, especially as he did not move aside, but stood directly\nin front of me, staring into my face.\n\n\"What are you really doing here, Anne Beddingfeld?\" he said\nabruptly.\n\n\"I'm a gipsy seeing the world.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's true enough. The newspaper correspondent is only a\npretext. You've not the soul of the journalist. You're out for your\nown hand--snatching at life. But that's not all.\"\n\nWhat was he going to make me tell him? I was afraid--afraid. I\nlooked him full in the face. My eyes can't keep secrets like his,\nbut they can carry the war into the enemy's country.\n\n\"What are _you_ really doing here, Colonel Race?\" I asked\ndeliberately.\n\nFor a moment I thought he wasn't going to answer. He was clearly\ntaken aback, though. At last he spoke, and his words seemed to\nafford him a grim amusement.\n\n\"Pursuing ambition,\" he said. \"Just that--pursuing ambition. You\nwill remember, Miss Beddingfeld, that 'by that sin fell the angels,'\netc.\"\n\n\"They say,\" I said slowly, \"that you are really connected with the\nGovernment--that you are in the Secret Service. Is that true?\"\n\nWas it my fancy, or did he hesitate for a fraction of a second\nbefore he answered?\n\n\"I can assure you, Miss Beddingfeld, that I am out here strictly\nas a private individual travelling for my own pleasure.\"\n\nThinking the answer over later, it struck me as slightly ambiguous.\nPerhaps he meant it to be so.\n\nWe rejoined the car in silence. Half-way back to Bulawayo we\nstopped for tea at a somewhat primitive structure at the side of\nthe road.", "The proprietor was digging in the garden and seemed\nannoyed at being disturbed. But he graciously promised to see what\nhe could do. After an interminable wait he brought us some stale\ncakes and some lukewarm tea. Then he disappeared to his garden\nagain.\n\nNo sooner had he departed than we were surrounded by cats. Six of\nthem all miaowing piteously at once. The racket was deafening. I\noffered them some pieces of cake. They devoured them ravenously.\nI poured all the milk there was into a saucer and they fought each\nother to get it.\n\n\"Oh,\" I cried indignantly, \"they're starved! It's wicked. Please,\nplease, order some more milk and another plate of cake.\"\n\nColonel Race departed silently to do my bidding. The cats had begun\nmiaowing again. He returned with a big jug of milk and the cats\nfinished it all.\n\nI got up with determination on my face.\n\n\"I'm going to take those cats home with us--I shan't leave them\nhere.\"\n\n\"My dear child, don't be absurd. You can't carry six cats as well\nas fifty wooden animals round with you.\"\n\n\"Never mind the wooden animals. These cats are alive. I shall take\nthem back with me.\"\n\n\"You will do nothing of the kind.\" I looked at him resentfully,\nbut he went on: \"You think me cruel--but one can't go through life\nsentimentalizing over these things. It's no good standing out--I\nshan't allow you to take them. It's a primitive country, you know,\nand I'm stronger than you.\"\n\nI always know when I am beaten. I went down to the car with tears\nin my eyes.\n\n\"They're probably short of food just to-day,\" he explained\nconsolingly. \"That man's wife has gone into Bulawayo for stores.\nSo it will be all right. And anyway, you know, the world's full of\nstarving cats.\"\n\n\"Don't--don't,\" I said fiercely.\n\n\"I'm teaching you to realize life as it is. I'm teaching you to be\nhard and ruthless--like I am. That's the secret of strength--and the\nsecret of success.\"\n\n\"I'd sooner be dead than hard,\" I said passionately.", "We got into the car and started off. I pulled myself together again\nslowly. Suddenly, to my intense astonishment, he took my hand in\nhis.\n\n\"Anne,\" he said gently, \"I want you. Will you marry me?\"\n\nI was utterly taken aback.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" I stammered. \"I can't.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I don't care for you in that way. I've never thought of you like\nthat.\"\n\n\"I see. Is that the only reason?\"\n\nI had to be honest. I owed it him.\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"it is not. You see--I--care for some one else.\"\n\n\"I see,\" he said again. \"And was that true at the beginning--when\nI first saw you--on the _Kilmorden?\"_\n\n\"No,\" I whispered. \"It was--since then.\"\n\n\"I see,\" he said for the third time, but this time there was a\npurposeful ring in his voice that made me turn and look at him.\nHis face was grimmer than I had ever seen it.\n\n\"What--what do you mean?\" I faltered.\n\nHe looked at me, inscrutable, dominating.\n\n\"Only--that I know now what I have to do.\"\n\nHis words sent a shiver through me. There was a determination\nbehind them that I did not understand--and it frightened me.\n\nWe neither of us said any more until we got back to the hotel. I\nwent straight up to Suzanne. She was lying on her bed reading, and\ndid not look in the least as though she had a headache.\n\n\"Here reposes the perfect gooseberry,\" she remarked. _\"Alias_ the\ntactful chaperone. Why, Anne dear, what's the matter?\"\n\nFor I had burst into a flood of tears.\n\nI told her about the cats--I felt it wasn't fair to tell her about\nColonel Race. But Suzanne is very sharp. I think she saw that there\nwas something more behind.\n\n\"You haven't caught a chill, have you, Anne? Sounds absurd even to\nsuggest such things in this heat, but you keep on shivering.\"\n\n\"It's nothing,\" I said. \"Nerves--or some one walking over my grave.\nI keep feeling something dreadful's going to happen.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" said Suzanne, with decision.", "\"Let's talk of\nsomething interesting. Anne, about those diamonds----\"\n\n\"What about them?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure they're safe with me. It was all right before, no\none could think they'd be amongst my things. But now that every\none knows we're such friends, you and I, I'll be under suspicion\ntoo.\"\n\n\"Nobody knows they're in a roll of films, though,\" I argued. \"It's\na splendid hiding-place and I really don't think we could better\nit.\"\n\nShe agreed doubtfully, but said we would discuss it again when we\ngot to the Falls.\n\nOur train went at nine o'clock. Sir Eustace's temper was still far\nfrom good, and Miss Pettigrew looked subdued. Colonel Race was\ncompletely himself. I felt that I had dreamed the whole conversation\non the way back.\n\nI slept heavily that night on my hard bunk, struggling with\nill-defined, menacing dreams. I awoke with a headache and went out\non the observation platform of the car. It was fresh and lovely,\nand everywhere, as far as one could see, were the undulating wooded\nhills. I loved it--loved it more than any place I had ever seen. I\nwished then that I could have a little hut somewhere in the heart\nof the scrub and live there always--always. . . .\n\nJust before half-past two, Colonel Race called me out from the\n\"office\" and pointed to a bouquet-shaped white mist that hovered\nover one portion of the bush.\n\n\"The spray from the Falls,\" he said. \"We are nearly there.\"\n\nI was still wrapped in that strange dream feeling of exaltation\nthat had succeeded my troubled night. Very strongly implanted in\nme was the feeling that I had come home. . . . Home! And yet I had\nnever been here before--or had I in dreams?\n\nWe walked from the train to the hotel, a big white building closely\nwired against mosquitoes. There were no roads, no houses. We went\nout on the _stoep_ and I uttered a gasp. There, half a mile away,\nfacing us, were the Falls. I've never seen anything so grand and\nbeautiful--I never shall.\n\n\"Anne, you're fey,\" said Suzanne, as we sat down to lunch.", "\"I've\nnever seen you like this before.\"\n\nShe stared at me curiously.\n\n\"Am I?\" I laughed, but I felt that my laugh was unnatural. \"It's\njust that I love it all.\"\n\n\"It's more than that.\"\n\nA little frown creased her brow--one of apprehension.\n\nYes, I was happy, but beyond that I had the curious feeling that\nI was waiting for something--something that would happen soon. I\nwas excited--restless.\n\nAfter tea we strolled out, got on the trolley and were pushed by\nsmiling blacks down the little tracks of rails to the bridge.\n\nIt was a marvellous sight, the great chasm and the rushing waters\nbelow, and the veil of mist and spray in front of us that parted\nevery now and then for one brief minute to show the cataract of\nwater and then closed up again in its impenetrable mystery. That,\nto my mind, has always been the fascination of the Falls--their\nelusive quality. You always think you're going to see--and you never\ndo.\n\nWe crossed the bridge and walked slowly on by the path that was\nmarked out with white stone on either side and led round the brink\nof the gorge. Finally we arrived in a big clearing where on the\nleft a path led downwards towards the chasm.\n\n\"The palm gully,\" explained Colonel Race. \"Shall we go down? Or\nshall we leave it until to-morrow? It will take some time, and it's\na good climb up again.\"\n\n\"We'll leave it until to-morrow,\" said Sir Eustace with decision.\nHe isn't at all fond of strenuous physical exercise, I have noticed.\n\nHe led the way back. As we went, we passed a fine native stalking\nalong. Behind him came a woman who seemed to have the entire\nhousehold belongings piled upon her head! The collection included\na frying pan!\n\n\"I never have my camera when I want it,\" groaned Suzanne.\n\n\"That's an opportunity that will occur often enough, Mrs. Blair,\"\nsaid Colonel Race. \"So don't lament.\"\n\nWe arrived back on the bridge.\n\n\"Shall we go into the rainbow forest?\" he continued.", "\"Or are you\nafraid of getting wet?\"\n\nSuzanne and I accompanied him. Sir Eustace went back to the hotel.\nI was rather disappointed in the rainbow forest. There weren't\nnearly enough rainbows, and we got soaked to the skin, but every\nnow and then we got a glimpse of the Falls opposite and realized\nhow enormously wide they are. Oh, dear, dear Falls, how I love and\nworship you and always shall!\n\nWe got back to the hotel just in time to change for dinner. Sir\nEustace seems to have taken a positive antipathy to Colonel Race.\nSuzanne and I rallied him gently, but didn't get much satisfaction.\n\nAfter dinner, he retired to his sitting-room, dragging Miss\nPettigrew with him. Suzanne and I talked for a while with Colonel\nRace, and then she declared, with an immense yawn, that she was\ngoing to bed. I didn't want to be left alone with him, so I got up\ntoo and went to my room.\n\nBut I was far too excited to go to sleep. I did not even undress.\nI lay back in a chair and gave myself up to dreaming. And all the\ntime I was conscious of something coming nearer and nearer. . . .\n\nThere was a knock at the door and I started. I got up and went to\nit. A little black boy held out a note. It was addressed to me in\na handwriting I did not know. I took it and came back into the\nroom. I stood there holding it. At last I opened it. It was very\nshort:\n\n\"I must see you. I dare not come to the hotel. Will you come to\nthe clearing by the palm gully? In memory of Cabin 17 please come.\nThe man you knew as Harry Rayburn.\"\n\nMy heart beat to suffocation. He was here then! Oh, I had known\nit--I had known it all along! I had felt him near me. All unwittingly\nI had come to his place of retreat.\n\nI wound a scarf round my head and stole to the door. I must be\ncareful.", "He was hunted down. No one must see me meet him. I stole\nalong to Suzanne's room. She was fast asleep. I could hear her\nbreathing evenly.\n\nSir Eustace? I paused outside the door of his sitting-room. Yes,\nhe was dictating to Miss Pettigrew, I could hear her monotonous\nvoice repeating. \"I therefore venture to suggest, that in tackling\nthis problem of coloured labour----\" She paused for him to continue,\nand I heard him grunt something angrily.\n\nI stole on again. Colonel Race's room was empty. I did not see him\nin the lounge. And he was the man I feared most! Still, I could\nwaste no more time. I slipped quickly out of the hotel and took\nthe path to the bridge.\n\nI crossed it and stood there waiting in the shadow. If any one had\nfollowed me, I should see them crossing the bridge. But the minutes\npassed, and no one came. I had not been followed. I turned and took\nthe path to the clearing. I took six paces or so and then stopped.\nSomething had rustled behind me. It could not be any one who had\nfollowed me from the hotel. It was some one who was already here,\nwaiting.\n\nAnd immediately, without rhyme or reason, but with the sureness of\ninstinct, I knew that it was I myself who was threatened. It was\nthe same feeling as I had had on the _Kilmorden_ that night--a sure\ninstinct warning me of danger.\n\nI looked sharply over my shoulder. Silence. I moved on a pace or\ntwo. Again I heard that rustle. Still walking, I looked over my\nshoulder again. A man's figure came out of the shadow. He saw that\nI saw him, and jumped forward, hard on my track.\n\nIt was too dark to recognize anybody. All I could see was that he\nwas tall, and a European, not a native. I took to my heels and ran.\nI heard him pounding behind. I ran quicker, keeping my eyes fixed\non the white stones that showed me where to step, for there was no\nmoon that night.", "And suddenly my foot felt nothingness. I heard the man behind me\nlaugh, an evil, sinister laugh. It rang in my ears, as I fell\nheadlong--down--down--down to destruction far beneath.\n\nI came to myself slowly and painfully. I was conscious of an aching\nhead and a shooting pain down my left arm when I tried to move,\nand everything seemed dream-like and unreal. Nightmare visions\nfloated before me. I felt myself falling--falling again. Once Harry\nRayburn's face seemed to come to me out of the mist. Almost I\nimagined it real. Then it floated away again, mocking me. Once, I\nremember, some one put a cup to my lips and I drank. A black face\ngrinned into mine--a devil's face, I thought it, and screamed out.\nThen dreams again--long troubled dreams in which I vainly sought\nHarry Rayburn to warn him--warn him--what of? I did not know myself.\nBut there was some danger--some great danger--and I alone could save\nhim. Then darkness again, merciful darkness, and real sleep.\n\nI woke at last myself again. The long nightmare was over. I\nremembered perfectly everything that had happened, my hurried\nflight from the hotel to meet Harry, the man in the shadows and\nthat last terrible moment of falling. . . .\n\nBy some miracle or other I had not been killed. I was bruised and\naching and very weak, but I was alive. But where was I? Moving my\nhead with difficulty I looked round me. I was in a small room with\nrough wooden walls. On them were hung skins of animals and various\ntusks of ivory. I was lying on a kind of rough couch, also covered\nwith skins, and my left arm was bandaged up and felt stiff and\nuncomfortable. At first I thought I was alone, and then I saw a\nman's figure sitting between me and the light, his head turned\ntoward the window. He was so still that he might have been carved\nout of wood. Something in the close-cropped black head was familiar\nto me, but I did not dare to let my imagination run astray.", "Suddenly\nhe turned, and I caught my breath. It was Harry Rayburn. Harry\nRayburn in the flesh.\n\nHe rose and came over to me.\n\n\"Feeling better?\" he said a trifle awkwardly.\n\nI could not answer. The tears were running down my face. I was weak\nstill, but I held his hand in both of mine. If only I could die\nlike this, whilst he stood there looking down on me with that new\nlook in his eyes.\n\n\"Don't cry, Anne. Please don't cry. You're safe now. No one shall\nhurt you.\"\n\nHe went and fetched a cup and brought it to me.\n\n\"Drink some of this milk.\"\n\nI drank obediently. He went on talking in a low coaxing tone such\nas he might have used to a child.\n\n\"Don't ask any more questions now. Go to sleep again. You'll be\nstronger by and by. I'll go away if you like.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said urgently. \"No, no.\n\n\"Then I'll stay.\"\n\nHe brought a small stool over beside me and sat there. He laid his\nhand over mine, and, soothed and comforted, I dropped off to sleep\nonce more.\n\nIt must have been evening then, but when I woke again the sun was\nhigh in the heavens. I was alone in the hut, but as I stirred an\nold native woman came running in. She was hideous as sin, but she\ngrinned at me encouragingly. She brought me water in a basin and\nhelped me wash my face and hands. Then she brought me a large bowl\nof soup, and I finished it every drop! I asked her several\nquestions, but she only grinned and nodded and chattered away in\na guttural language, so I gathered she knew no English.\n\nSuddenly she stood up and drew back respectfully as Harry Rayburn\nentered. He gave her a nod of dismissal and she went out leaving\nus alone. He smiled at me.\n\n\"Really better to-day!\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, but very bewildered still. Where am I?\"\n\n\"You're on a small island on the Zambesi about four miles up from\nthe Falls.\"\n\n\"Do--do my friends know I'm here?\"", "He shook his head.\n\n\"I must send word to them.\"\n\n\"That is as you like of course, but if I were you I should wait\nuntil you are a little stronger.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nHe did not answer immediately, so I went on.\n\n\"How long have I been here?\"\n\nHis answer amazed me.\n\n\"Nearly a month.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" I cried. \"I must send word to Suzanne. She'll be terribly\nanxious.\"\n\n\"Who is Suzanne?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Blair. I was with her and Sir Eustace and Colonel Race at\nthe hotel--but you knew that surely?\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"I know nothing, except that I found you, caught in the fork of a\ntree, unconscious and with a badly wrenched arm.\"\n\n\"Where was the tree?\"\n\n\"Overhanging the ravine. But for your clothes catching on the\nbranches, you would infallibly have been dashed to pieces.\"\n\nI shuddered. Then a thought struck me.\n\n\"You say you didn't know I was there. What about the note then?\"\n\n\"What note?\"\n\n\"The note you sent me, asking me to meet you in the clearing.\"\n\nHe stared at me.\n\n\"I sent no note.\"\n\nI felt myself flushing up to the roots of my hair. Fortunately he\ndid not seem to notice.\n\n\"How did you come to be on the spot in such a marvellous manner?\"\nI asked in as nonchalant a manner as I could assume. \"And what are\nyou doing in this part of the world, anyway?\"\n\n\"I live here,\" he said simply.\n\n\"On this island?\"\n\n\"Yes, I came here after the War. Sometimes I take parties from the\nhotel out in my boat, but it costs me very little to live, and\nmostly I do as I please.\"\n\n\"You live here all alone?\"\n\n\"I am not pining for society, I assure you,\" he replied coldly.\n\n\"I am sorry to have inflicted mine upon you,\" I retorted, \"but I\nseem to have had very little to say in the matter.\"\n\nTo my surprise his eyes twinkled a little.\n\n\"None whatever. I slung you across my shoulders like a sack of coal\nand carried you to my boat. Quite like a primitive man of the Stone\nAge.\"", "\"But for a different reason,\" I put in.\n\n_He_ flushed this time, a deep burning blush. The tan of his face\nwas suffused.\n\n\"But you haven't told me how you came to be wandering about so\nconveniently for me?\" I said hastily, to cover his confusion.\n\n\"I couldn't sleep. I was restless--disturbed--had the feeling\nsomething was going to happen. In the end I took the boat and came\nashore and tramped down towards the Falls. I was just at the head\nof the palm gully when I heard you scream.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you get help from the hotel instead of carting me all\nthe way here?\" I asked.\n\nHe flushed again.\n\n\"I suppose it seems an unpardonable liberty to you--but I don't\nthink that even now you realize your danger! You think I should\nhave informed your friends? Pretty friends, who allowed you to be\ndecoyed out to death. No, I swore to myself that I'd take better\ncare of you than any one else could. Not a soul comes to this\nisland. I got old Batani, whom I cured of a fever once, to come\nand look after you. She's loyal. She'll never say a word. I could\nkeep you here for months and no one would ever know.\"\n\n_I could keep you here for months and no one would ever know!_ How\nsome words please one!\n\n\"You did quite right,\" I said quietly. \"And I shall not send word\nto any one. A day or so more anxiety doesn't make much difference.\nIt's not as though they were my own people. They're only\nacquaintances really--even Suzanne. And whoever wrote that note must\nhave known--a great deal. It was not the work of an outsider.\"\n\nI managed to mention the note this time without blushing at all.\n\n\"If you would be guided by me----\" he said, hesitating.\n\n\"I don't expect I shall be,\" I answered candidly. \"But there's no\nharm in hearing.\"\n\n\"Do you always do what you like, Miss Beddingfeld?\"\n\n\"Usually,\" I replied cautiously. To any one else I would have said\n\"Always.\"", "\"I pity your husband,\" he said unexpectedly.\n\n\"You needn't,\" I retorted. \"I shouldn't dream of marrying any one\nunless I was madly in love with them. And of course there is really\nnothing a woman enjoys so much as doing all the things she doesn't\nlike for the sake of some one she _does_ like. And the more\nself-willed she is, the more she likes it.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I disagree with you. The boot is on the other leg as\na rule.\" He spoke with a slight sneer.\n\n\"Exactly,\" I cried eagerly. \"And that's why there are so many\nunhappy marriages. It's all the fault of the men. Either they give\nway to their women--and then the women despise them, or else they\nare utterly selfish, insist on their own way and never say 'thank\nyou.' Successful husbands make their wives do just what they want,\nand then make a frightful fuss of them for doing it. Women like to\nbe mastered, but they hate not to have their sacrifices appreciated.\nOn the other hand, men don't really appreciate women who are nice\nto them all the time. When I am married, I shall be a devil most\nof the time, but every now and then, when my husband least expects\nit, I shall show him what a perfect angel I can be!\"\n\nHarry laughed outright.\n\n\"What a cat and dog life you will lead.\"\n\n\"Lovers always fight,\" I assured him. \"Because they don't understand\neach other. And by the time they do understand each other they\naren't in love any more.\"\n\n\"Does the reverse hold true? Are people who fight each other always\nlovers?\"\n\n\"I--I don't know,\" I said, momentarily confused.\n\nHe turned away to the fireplace.\n\n\"Like some more soup?\" he asked in a casual tone.\n\n\"Yes, please. I'm so hungry that I could eat a hippopotamus.\"\n\n\"That's good.\"\n\nHe busied himself with the fire; I watched.\n\n\"When I can get off the couch, I'll cook for you,\" I promised.\n\n\"I don't suppose you know anything about cooking.\"\n\n\"I can warm up things out of tins as well as you can,\" I retorted,\npointing to a row of tins on the mantelpiece.", "_\"Touche,\"_ he said, and laughed.\n\nHis whole face changed when he laughed. It became boyish, happy--a\ndifferent personality.\n\nI enjoyed my soup. As I ate it I reminded him that he had not,\nafter all, tendered me his advice.\n\n\"Ah, yes, what I was going to say was this. If I were you I would\nstay quietly _perdu_ here until you are quite strong again. Your\nenemies will believe you dead. They will hardly be surprised at\nnot finding the body. It would have been dashed to pieces on the\nrocks and carried down with the torrent.\"\n\nI shivered.\n\n\"Once you are completely restored to health, you can journey\nquietly on to Beira and get a boat to take you back to England.\"\n\n\"That would be very tame,\" I objected scornfully.\n\n\"There speaks a foolish schoolgirl.\"\n\n\"I'm not a foolish schoolgirl,\" I cried indignantly. \"I'm a woman.\"\n\nHe looked at me with an expression I could not fathom as I sat up\nflushed and excited.\n\n\"God help me, so you are,\" he muttered, and went abruptly out.\n\nMy recovery was rapid. The two injuries I had sustained were a\nknock on the head and a badly wrenched arm. The latter was the most\nserious and, to begin with, my rescuer had believed it to be\nactually broken. A careful examination, however, convinced him that\nit was not so, and although it was very painful I was recovering\nthe use of it quite quickly.\n\nIt was a strange time. We were cut off from the world, alone\ntogether as Adam and Eve might have been--but with what a difference!\nOld Batani hovered about counting no more than a dog might have\ndone. I insisted on doing the cooking, or as much of it as I could\nmanage with one arm. Harry was out a good part of the time, but we\nspent long hours together lying out in the shade of the palms,\ntalking and quarrelling--discussing everything under high heaven,\nquarrelling and making it up again. We bickered a good deal, but\nthere grew up between us a real and lasting comradeship such as I\ncould never have believed possible.", "That--and something else.\n\nThe time was drawing near, I knew it, when I should be well enough\nto leave and I realized it with a heavy heart. Was he going to let\nme go? Without a word? Without a sign? He had fits of silence, long\nmoody intervals, moments when he would spring up and tramp off by\nhimself. One evening the crisis came. We had finished our simple\nmeal and were sitting in the doorway of the hut. The sun was\nsinking.\n\nHairpins were necessities of life with which Harry had not been\nable to provide me, and my hair, straight and black, hung to my\nknees. I sat, my chin on my hands, lost in meditation. I felt\nrather than saw Harry looking at me.\n\n\"You look like a witch, Anne,\" he said at last, and there was\nsomething in his voice that had never been there before.\n\nHe reached out his hand and just touched my hair. I shivered.\nSuddenly he sprang up with an oath.\n\n\"You must leave here to-morrow, do you hear?\" he cried. \"I--I can't\nbear any more. I'm only a man after all. You must go, Anne. You\nmust. You're not a fool. You know yourself that this can't go on.\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" I said slowly. \"But--it's been happy, hasn't it?\"\n\n\"Happy? It's been hell!\"\n\n\"As bad as that!\"\n\n\"What do you torment me for? Why are you mocking at me? Why do you\nsay that--laughing into your hair?\"\n\n\"I wasn't laughing. And I'm not mocking. If you want me to go, I'll\ngo. But if you want me to stay--I'll stay.\"\n\n\"Not that!\" he cried vehemently. \"Not that. Don't tempt me, Anne.\nDo you realize what I am? A criminal twice over. A man hunted down.\nThey know me here as Harry Parker--they think I've been away on a\ntrek up country, but any day they may put two and two together--and\nthen the blow will fall. You're so young, Anne, and so beautiful--with\nthe kind of beauty that sends men mad.", "All the world's before\nyou--love, life, everything. Mine's behind me--scorched, spoiled,\nwith a taste of bitter ashes.\"\n\n\"If you don't want me----\"\n\n\"You know I want you. You know that I'd give my soul to pick you\nup in my arms and keep you here, hidden away from the world, for\never and ever. And you're tempting me, Anne. You, with your long\nwitch's hair, and your eyes that are golden and brown and green\nand never stop laughing even when your mouth is grave. But I'll\nsave you from yourself and from me. You shall go to-night. You\nshall go to Beira----\"\n\n\"I'm not going to Beira,\" I interrupted.\n\n\"You are. You shall go to Beira if I have to take you there myself\nand throw you on to the boat. What do you think I'm made of? Do\nyou think I'll wake up night after night, fearing they've got you?\nOne can't go on counting on miracles happening. You must go back\nto England, Anne--and--and marry and be happy.\"\n\n\"With a steady man who'll give me a good home!\"\n\n\"Better that than--utter disaster.\"\n\n\"And what of you?\"\n\nHis face grew grim and set.\n\n\"I've got my work ready to hand. Don't ask what it is. You can\nguess, I dare say. But I'll tell you this--I'll clear my name, or\ndie in the attempt, and I'll choke the life out of the damned\nscoundrel who did his best to murder you the other night.\"\n\n\"We must be fair,\" I said. \"He didn't actually push me over.\"\n\n\"He'd no need to. His plan was cleverer than that. I went up to\nthe path afterwards. Everything looked all right, but by the marks\non the ground I saw that the stones which outline the path had been\ntaken up and put down again in a slightly different place. There\nare tall bushes growing just over the edge. He'd balanced the\noutside stones on them, so that you'd think you were still on the\npath when in reality you were stepping into nothingness. God help\nhim if I lay my hands upon him!\"", "He paused a minute and then said in a totally different tone:\n\n\"We've never spoken of these things, Anne, have we? But the time's\ncome. I want you to hear the whole story--from the beginning.\"\n\n\"If it hurts you to go over the past, don't tell me,\" I said in a\nlow voice.\n\n\"But I want you to know. I never thought I should speak of that\npart of my life to any one. Funny, isn't it, the tricks Fate\nplays?\"\n\nHe was silent for a minute or two. The sun had set, and the velvety\ndarkness of the African night was enveloping us like a mantle.\n\n\"Some of it I know,\" I said gently.\n\n\"What do you know?\"\n\n\"I know that your real name is Harry Lucas.\"\n\nStill he hesitated--not looking at me, but staring straight out in\nfront of him. I had no clue as to what was passing in his mind,\nbut at last he jerked his head forward as though acquiescing in\nsome unspoken decision of his own and began his story.\n\n\"You are right. My real name is Harry Lucas. My father was a\nretired soldier who came out to farm in Rhodesia. He died when I\nwas in my second year at Cambridge.\"\n\n\"Were you fond of him?\" I asked suddenly.\n\n\"I--don't know.\"\n\nThen he flushed and went on with sudden vehemence:\n\n\"Why do I say that? I _did_ love my father. We said bitter things\nto each other the last time I saw him, and we had many rows over\nmy wildness and my debts, but I cared for the old man. I know how\nmuch now--when it's too late,\" he continued more quietly. \"It was\nat Cambridge that I met the other fellow----\"\n\n\"Young Eardsley?\"\n\n\"Yes--young Eardsley. His father, as you know, was one of South\nAfrica's most prominent men. We drifted together at once, my friend\nand I. We had our love of South Africa in common and we both had\na taste for the untrodden places of the world. After he left\nCambridge, Eardsley had a final quarrel with his father.", "The old\nman had paid his debts twice, he refused to do so again. There was\na bitter scene between them. Sir Laurence declared himself at the\nend of his patience--he would do no more for his son. He must stand\non his own legs for a while. The result was, as you know, that\nthose two young men went off to South America together, prospecting\nfor diamonds. I'm not going into that now, but we had a wonderful\ntime out there. Hardships in plenty, you understand, but it was a\ngood life--a hand-to-mouth scramble for existence far from the\nbeaten track--and, my God! that's the place to know a friend. There\nwas a bond forged between us two out there that only death could\nhave broken. Well, as Colonel Race told you, our efforts were\ncrowned with success. We found a second Kimberley in the heart of\nthe British Guiana jungles. I can't tell you our elation. It wasn't\nso much the actual value in money of the find--you see, Eardsley\nwas used to money, and he knew that when his father died he would\nbe a millionaire, and Lucas had always been poor and was used to\nit. No, it was the sheer delight of discovery.\"\n\nHe paused, and then added, almost apologetically:\n\n\"You don't mind my telling it this way, do you? As though I wasn't\nin it at all. It seems like that now when I look back and see those\ntwo boys. I almost forget that one of them was--Harry Rayburn.\"\n\n\"Tell it any way you like,\" I said, and he went on:\n\n\"We came to Kimberley--very cock-a-hoop over our find. We brought\na magnificent selection of diamonds with us to submit to the\nexperts. And then--in the hotel at Kimberley--we met her----\"\n\nI stiffened a little, and the hand that rested on the doorpost\nclenched itself involuntarily.\n\n\"Anita Grunberg--that was her name. She was an actress. Quite young\nand very beautiful. She was South African born, but her mother was\na Hungarian, I believe.", "There was some sort of mystery about her,\nand that, of course, heightened her attraction for two boys home\nfrom the wilds. She must have had an easy task. We both fell for\nher right away, and we both took it hard. It was the first shadow\nthat had ever come between us--but even then it didn't weaken our\nfriendship. Each of us, I honestly believe, was willing to stand\naside for the other to go in and win. But that wasn't her game.\nSometimes, afterwards, I wondered why it hadn't been, for Sir\nLaurence Eardsley's only son was quite a _parti._ But the truth of\nit was that she was married--to a sorter in De Beers'--though nobody\nknew of it. She pretended enormous interests in our discovery, and\nwe told her all about it and even showed her the diamonds.\nDelilah--that's what she should have been called--and she played her\npart well!\n\n\"The De Beers robbery was discovered, and like a thunderclap the\npolice came down upon us. They seized our diamonds. We only laughed\nat first--the whole thing was so absurd. And then the diamonds were\nproduced in court--and without question they were the stones stolen\nfrom De Beers'. Anita Grunberg had disappeared. She had effected\nthe substitution neatly enough, and our story that these were not\nthe stones originally in our possession was laughed to scorn.\n\n\"Sir Laurence Eardsley had enormous influence. He succeeded in\ngetting the case dismissed--but it left two young men ruined and\ndisgraced to face the world with the stigma of thief attached to\ntheir names, and it pretty well broke the old fellow's heart. He\nhad one bitter interview with his son in which he heaped upon him\nevery reproach imaginable. He had done what he could to save the\nfamily name, but from that day on his son was his son no longer.\nHe cast him off utterly. And the boy, like the proud young fool\nthat he was, remained silent, disdaining to protest his innocence\nin the face of his father's disbelief.", "He came out furious from\nthe interview--his friend was waiting for him. A week later war was\ndeclared. The two friends enlisted together. You know what happened.\nThe best pal a man ever had was killed, partly through his own mad\nrecklessness in rushing into unnecessary danger. He died with his\nname tarnished. . . .\n\n\"I swear to you, Anne, that it was mainly on his account that I\nwas so bitter against that woman. It had gone deeper with him than\nwith me. I had been madly in love with her for the moment--I even\nthink that I frightened her sometimes--but with him it was a quieter\nand deeper feeling. She had been the very centre of his universe--and\nher betrayal of him tore up the very roots of life. The blow\nstunned him and left him paralyzed.\"\n\nHarry paused. After a minute or two he went on:\n\n\"As you know, I was reported 'Missing, presumed killed.' I never\ntroubled to correct the mistake. I took the name of Parker and came\nto this island, which I knew of old. At the beginning of the war,\nI had had ambitious hopes of proving my innocence, but now all that\nspirit seemed dead. All I felt was, 'What's the good?' My pal was\ndead, neither he nor I had any living relations who would care. I\nwas supposed to be dead too, let it remain at that. I led a peaceful\nexistence here, neither happy nor unhappy--numbed of all feeling.\nI see now, though I did not realize it at the time, that that was\npartly the effect of the war.\n\n\"And then one day something occurred to wake me right up again. I\nwas taking a party of people in my boat on a trip up the river,\nand I was standing at the landing-stage, helping them in, when one\nof the men uttered a startled exclamation. It focused my attention\non him. He was a small, thin man with a beard, and he was staring\nat me for all he was worth as though I was a ghost.", "So powerful\nwas his emotion that it awakened my curiosity. I made inquiries\nabout him at the hotel and learned that his name was Carton, that\nhe came from Kimberley, and that he was a diamond-sorter employed\nby De Beers'. In a minute all the old sense of wrong surged over\nme again. I left the island and went to Kimberley.\n\n\"I could find out little more about him, however. In the end, I\ndecided that I must force an interview. I took my revolver with\nme. In the brief glimpse I had had of him, I had realized that he\nwas a physical coward. No sooner were we face to face than I\nrecognized that he was afraid of me. I soon forced him to tell me\nall he knew. He had engineered part of the robbery and Anita\nGrunberg was his wife. He had once caught sight of both of us when\nwe were dining with her at the hotel, and, having read that I was\nkilled, my appearance in the flesh at the Falls had startled him\nbadly. He and Anita had married quite young, but she had soon\ndrifted away from him. She had got in with a bad lot, he told\nme--and it was then for the first time that I heard of the 'Colonel.'\nCarton himself had never been mixed up in anything except this one\naffair--so he solemnly assured me, and I was inclined to believe\nhim. He was emphatically not of the stuff of which successful\ncriminals are made.\n\n\"I still had the feeling that he was keeping back something. As a\ntest, I threatened to shoot him there and then, declaring that I\ncared very little what became of me now. In a frenzy of terror he\npoured out a further story. It seems that Anita Grunberg did not\nquite trust the 'Colonel.' Whilst pretending to hand over to him\nthe stones she had taken from the hotel, she kept back some in her\nown possession. Carton advised her, with his technical knowledge,\nwhich to keep. If, at any time, these stones were produced, they\nwere of such colour and quality as to be readily identifiable, and\nthe experts at De Beers' would admit at once that these stones had\nnever passed through their hands.", "In this way my story of a\nsubstitution would be supported, my name would be cleared, and\nsuspicion would be diverted to the proper quarter. I gathered that,\ncontrary to his usual practice, the 'Colonel' himself had been\nconcerned in this affair, therefore Anita felt satisfied that she\nhad a real hold over him, should she need it. Carton now proposed\nthat I should make a bargain with Anita Grunberg, or Nadina, as\nshe now called herself. For a sufficient sum of money he thought\nthat she would be willing to give up the diamonds and betray her\nformer employer. He would cable to her immediately.\n\n\"I was still suspicious of Carton. He was a man whom it was easy\nenough to frighten, but who, in his fright, would tell so many lies\nthat to sift the truth out from them would be no easy job. I went\nback to the hotel and waited. By the following evening I judged\nthat he would have received the reply to his cable. I called round\nat his house and was told that Mr. Carton was away, but would be\nreturning on the morrow. Instantly I became suspicious. In the nick\nof time I found out that he was in reality sailing for England on\nthe _Kilmorden Castle,_ which left Cape Town in two days' time. I\nhad just time to journey down and catch the same boat.\n\n\"I had no intention of alarming Carton by revealing my presence on\nboard. I had done a good deal of acting in my time at Cambridge,\nand it was comparatively easy for me to transform myself into a\ngrave bearded gentleman of middle age. I avoided Carton carefully\non board the boat, keeping to my own cabin as far as possible under\nthe pretence of illness.\n\n\"I had no difficulty in trailing him when we got to London. He went\nstraight to an hotel and did not go out until the following day.\nHe left the hotel shortly before one o'clock. I was behind him. He\nwent straight to a house-agent in Knightsbridge. There he asked\nfor particulars of houses to let on the river.", "\"I was at the next table also inquiring about houses. Then suddenly\nin walked Anita Grunberg, Nadina--whatever you like to call her.\nSuperb, insolent, and almost as beautiful as ever. God! how I hated\nher. There she was, the woman who had ruined my life--and who had\nalso ruined a better life than mine. At that minute I could have\nput my hands round her neck and squeezed the life out of her inch\nby inch! Just for a minute or two I saw red. I hardly took in what\nthe agent was saying. It was her voice that I heard next, high and\nclear, with an exaggerated foreign accent: 'The Mill House, Marlow.\nThe property of Sir Eustace Pedler. That sounds as though it might\nsuit me. At any rate, I will go and see it.'\n\n\"The man wrote her an order, and she walked out again in her regal\ninsolent manner. Not by word or a sign had she recognized Carton,\nyet I was sure that their meeting there was a preconceived plan.\nThen I started to jump to conclusions. Not knowing that Sir Eustace\nwas at Cannes, I thought that this house-hunting business was a\nmere pretext for meeting him in the Mill House. I knew that he had\nbeen in South Africa at the time of the robbery, and never having\nseen him I immediately leaped to the conclusion that he himself\nwas the mysterious 'Colonel' of whom I had heard so much.\n\n\"I followed my two suspects along Knightsbridge. Nadina went into\nthe Hyde Park Hotel. I quickened my pace and went in also. She\nwalked straight into the restaurant, and I decided that I would\nnot risk her recognizing me at the moment, but would continue to\nfollow Carton. I was in great hopes that he was going to get the\ndiamonds, and that by suddenly appearing and making myself known\nto him when he least expected it I might startle the truth out of\nhim. I followed him down into the Tube station at Hyde Park Corner.\nHe was standing by himself at the end of the platform.", "There was\nsome girl standing near, but no one else. I decided that I would\naccost him then and there. You know what happened. In the sudden\nshock of seeing a man whom he imagined far away in South Africa,\nhe lost his head and stepped back upon the line. He was always a\ncoward. Under the pretext of being a doctor, I managed to search\nhis pockets. There was a wallet with some notes in it and one or\ntwo unimportant letters, there was a roll of films--which I must\nhave dropped somewhere later--and there was a piece of paper with\nan appointment made on it for the 22nd on the _Kilmorden_ Castle.\nIn my haste to get away before any one detained me, I dropped that\nalso, but fortunately I remembered the figures.\n\n\"I hurried to the nearest cloak-room and hastily removed my make-up.\nI did not want to be laid by the heels for picking a dead man's\npocket. Then I retraced my steps to the Hyde Park Hotel. Nadina\nwas still having lunch. I needn't describe in detail how I followed\nher down to Marlow. She went into the house, and I spoke to the\nwoman at the lodge, pretending that I was with her. Then I, too,\nwent in.\"\n\nHe stopped. There was a tense silence.\n\n\"You will believe me, Anne, won't you? I swear before God that what\nI am going to say is true. I went into the house after her with\nsomething very like murder in my heart--and she was dead! I found\nher in that first-floor room--God! It was horrible. Dead--and I was\nnot more than three minutes behind her. And there was no sign of\nany one else in the house! Of course I realized at once the terrible\nposition I was in. By one master-stroke the blackmailed had rid\nhimself of the blackmailer, and at the same time had provided a\nvictim to whom the crime would be ascribed. The hand of the\n'Colonel' was very plain. For the second time I was to be his\nvictim.", "Fool that I had been to walk into the trap so easily.\n\n\"I hardly know what I did next. I managed to go out of the place\nlooking fairly normal, but I knew that it could not be long before\nthe crime was discovered and a description of my appearance\ntelegraphed all over the country.\n\n\"I lay low for some days, not daring to make a move. In the end\nchance came to my aid. I overheard a conversation between two\nmiddle-aged gentlemen in the street, one of whom proved to be Sir\nEustace Pedler. I at once conceived the idea of attaching myself\nto him as his secretary. The fragment of conversation I had\noverheard gave me my clue. I was now no longer so sure that Sir\nEustace Pedler was the 'Colonel.' His house might have been\nappointed as a rendezvous by accident, or for some obscure motive\nthat I had not fathomed.\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" I interrupted, \"that Guy Pagett was in Marlow at\nthe date of the murder?\"\n\n\"That settles it then. I thought he was at Cannes with Sir Eustace.\"\n\n\"He was supposed to be in Florence--but he certainly never went\n_there._ I'm pretty certain he was really in Marlow, but of course\nI can't prove it.\"\n\n\"And to think I never suspected Pagett for a minute until the night\nhe tried to throw you overboard. The man's a marvellous actor.\"\n\n\"Yes, isn't he?\"\n\n\"That explains why the Mill House was chosen. Pagett could probably\nget in and out of it unobserved. Of course he made no objection to\nmy accompanying Sir Eustace across in the boat. He didn't want me\nlaid by the heels immediately. You see, evidently Nadina didn't\nbring the jewels with her to the rendezvous as they had counted on\nher doing. I fancy that Carton really had them and concealed them\nsomewhere on the _Kilmorden Castle_--that's where he came in. They\nhoped that I might have some clue as to where they were hidden. As\nlong as the 'Colonel' did not recover the diamonds, he was still\nin danger--hence his anxiety to get them at all costs.", "Where the\ndevil Carton hid them--if he did hide them, I don't know.\"\n\n\"That's another story,\" I quoted. _\"My_ story. And I'm going to\ntell it you now.\"\n\nHarry listened attentively whilst I recounted all the events that\nI have narrated in these pages. The thing that bewildered and\nastonished him most was to find that all along the diamonds had\nbeen in my possession--or rather in Suzanne's. That was a fact he\nhad never suspected. Of course, after hearing his story, I realized\nthe point of Carton's little arrangement--or rather Nadina's, since\nI had no doubt that it was her brain which had conceived the plan.\nNo surprise tactics executed against her or her husband could\nresult in the seizure of the diamonds. The secret was locked in\nher own brain, and the \"Colonel\" was not likely to guess that they\nhad been entrusted to the keeping of an ocean steward!\n\nHarry's vindication from the old charge of theft seemed assured.\nIt was the other, graver charge that paralyzed all our activities.\nFor, as things stood, he could not come out in the open to prove\nhis case.\n\nThe one thing we came back to, again and again, was the identity\nof the \"Colonel.\" Was he, or was he not, Guy Pagett?\n\n\"I should say he was but for one thing,\" said Harry. \"It seems\npretty much of a certainty that it was Pagett who murdered Anita\nGrunberg at Marlow--and that certainly lends colour to the\nsupposition that he is actually the 'Colonel,' since Anita's\nbusiness was not of the nature to be discussed with a subordinate.\nNo--the only thing that militates against that theory is the attempt\nto put you out of the way on the night of your arrival here. You\nsaw Pagett left behind at Cape Town--by no possible means could he\nhave arrived here before the following Wednesday. He is unlikely\nto have any emissaries in this part of the world, and all his plans\nwere laid to deal with you in Cape Town. He might, of course, have\ncabled instructions to some lieutenant of his in Johannesburg, who\ncould have joined the Rhodesian train at Mafeking, but his\ninstructions would have had to be particularly definite to allow\nof that note being written.\"", "We sat silent for a moment, then Harry went on slowly: \"You say\nthat Mrs. Blair was asleep when you left the hotel and that you\nheard Sir Eustace dictating to Miss Pettigrew? Where was Colonel\nRace?\"\n\n\"I could not find him anywhere.\"\n\n\"Had he any reason to believe that--you and I might be friendly with\neach other?\"\n\n\"He might have had,\" I answered thoughtfully, remembering our\nconversation on the way back from the Matoppos. \"He's a very\npowerful personality,\" I continued, \"but not at all my idea of the\n'Colonel.' And, anyway, such an idea would be absurd. He's in the\nSecret Service.\"\n\n\"How do we know that he is? It's the easiest thing in the world to\nthrow out a hint of that kind. No one contradicts it, and the\nrumour spreads until every one believes it as gospel truth. It\nprovides an excuse for all sorts of doubtful doings. Anne, do you\nlike Race?\"\n\n\"I do--and I don't. He repels me and at the same time fascinates\nme; but I know one thing, I'm always a little afraid of him.\"\n\n\"He was in South Africa, you know, at the time of the Kimberley\nrobbery,\" said Harry slowly.\n\n\"But it was he who told Suzanne all about the 'Colonel' and how he\nhad been in Paris trying to get on his track.\"\n\n_\"Camouflage_--of a particularly clever kind.\"\n\n\"But where does Pagett come in? Is he in Race's pay?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Harry slowly, \"he doesn't come in at all.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Think back, Anne. Did you ever hear Pagett's own account of that\nnight on the _Kilmorden?\"_\n\n\"Yes--through Sir Eustace.\"\n\nI repeated it. Harry listened closely.\n\n\"He saw a man coming from the direction of Sir Eustace's cabin and\nfollowed him up on deck. Is that what he says? Now, who had the\ncabin opposite to Sir Eustace? Colonel Race. Supposing Colonel Race\ncrept up on deck, and, foiled in his attack on you, fled round the\ndeck and met Pagett just coming through the saloon door. He knocks\nhim down and springs inside, closing the door.", "We dash round and\nfind Pagett lying there. How's that?\"\n\n\"You forget that he declares positively it was you who knocked him\ndown.\"\n\n\"Well, suppose that just as he regains consciousness he sees me\ndisappearing in the distance? Wouldn't he take it for granted that\nI was his assailant? Especially as he thought all along it was I\nhe was following?\"\n\n\"It's possible, yes,\" I said slowly. \"But it alters all our ideas.\nAnd there are other things.\"\n\n\"Most of them are open to explanation. The man who followed you in\nCape Town spoke to Pagett, and Pagett looked at his watch. The man\nmight have merely asked him the time.\"\n\n\"It was just a coincidence, you mean?\"\n\n\"Not exactly. There's a method in all this, connecting Pagett with\nthe affair. Why was the Mill House chosen for the murder? Was it\nbecause Pagett had been in Kimberley when the diamonds were stolen?\nWould _he_ have been made the scapegoat if I had not appeared so\nprovidentially upon the scene?\"\n\n\"Then you think he may be entirely innocent?\"\n\n\"It looks like it, but, if so, we've got to find out what he was\ndoing in Marlow. If he's got a reasonable explanation of that,\nwe're on the right tack.\"\n\nHe got up.\n\n\"It's past midnight. Turn in, Anne, and get some sleep. Just before\ndawn I'll take you over in the boat. You must catch the train at\nLivingstone. I've got a friend there who will keep you hidden away\nuntil the train starts. You go to Bulawayo and catch the Beira\ntrain there. I can find out from my friend in Livingstone what's\ngoing on at the hotel and where your friends are now.\"\n\n\"Beira,\" I said meditatively.\n\n\"Yes, Anne, it's Beira for you. This is man's work. Leave it to\nme.\"\n\nWe had had a momentary respite from emotion whilst we talked the\nsituation out, but it was on us again now. We did not even look at\neach other.\n\n\"Very well,\" I said, and passed into the hut.\n\nI lay down on the skin-covered couch, but I didn't sleep, and\noutside I could hear Harry Rayburn pacing up and down, up and down\nthrough the long dark hours.", "At last he called me:\n\n\"Come, Anne, it's time to go.\"\n\nI got up and came out obediently. It was still quite dark, but I\nknew that dawn was not far off.\n\n\"We'll take the canoe, not the motor-boat----\" Harry began, when\nsuddenly he stopped dead and held up his hand.\n\n\"Hush! What's that?\"\n\nI listened, but could hear nothing. His ears were sharper than\nmine, however, the ears of a man who has lived long in the\nwilderness. Presently I heard it too--the faint splash of paddles\nin the water coming from the direction of the right bank of the\nriver and rapidly approaching our little landing-stage.\n\nWe strained our eyes in the darkness, and could make out a dark\nblur on the surface of the water. It was a boat. Then there was a\nmomentary spurt of flame. Some one had struck a match. By its light\nI recognized one figure, the red-bearded Dutchman of the villa at\nMuizenberg. The others were natives.\n\n\"Quick--back to the hut.\"\n\nHarry swept me back with him. He took down a couple of rifles and\na revolver from the wall.\n\n\"Can you load a rifle?\"\n\n\"I never have. Show me how.\"\n\nI grasped his instructions well enough. We closed the door and\nHarry stood by the window which overlooked the landing-stage. The\nboat was just about to run alongside it.\n\n\"Who's that?\" called out Harry in a ringing voice.\n\nAny doubt we might have had as to our visitors' intentions was\nswiftly resolved. A hail of bullets splattered round us. Fortunately\nneither of us was hit. Harry raised the rifle. It spat murderously,\nand again and again. I heard two groans and a splash.\n\n\"That's given 'em something to think about,\" he muttered grimly,\nas he reached for the second rifle. \"Stand well back, Anne, for\nGod's sake. And load quickly.\"\n\nMore bullets. One just grazed Harry's cheek. His answering fire\nwas more deadly than theirs. I had the rifle reloaded when he\nturned for it. He caught me close with his left arm and kissed me\nonce savagely before he turned to the window again.", "Suddenly he\nuttered a shout.\n\n\"They're going--had enough of it. They're a good mark out there on\nthe water, and they can't see how many of us there are. They're\nrouted for the moment--but they'll come back. We'll have to get\nready for them.\" He flung down the rifle and turned to me.\n\n\"Anne! You beauty! You wonder! You little queen! As brave as a\nlion. Black-haired witch!\"\n\nHe caught me in his arms. He kissed my hair, my eyes, my mouth.\n\n\"And now to business,\" he said, suddenly releasing me. \"Get out\nthose tins of paraffin.\"\n\nI did as I was told. He was busy inside the hut. Presently I saw\nhim on the roof of the hut, crawling along with something in his\narms. He rejoined me in a minute or two.\n\n\"Go down to the boat. We'll have to carry it across the island to\nthe other side.\"\n\nHe picked up the paraffin as I disappeared.\n\n\"They're coming back,\" I called softly. I had seen the blur moving\nout from the opposite shore.\n\nHe ran down to me.\n\n\"Just in time. Why--where the hell's the boat?\" Both had been cut\nadrift. Harry whistled softly. \"We're in a tight place, honey.\nMind?\"\n\n\"Not with you.\"\n\n\"Ah, but dying together's not much fun. We'll do better than that.\nSee--they've got two boat-loads this time. Going to land at two\ndifferent points. Now for my little scenic effect.\"\n\nAlmost as he spoke a long flame shot up from the hut. Its light\nilluminated two crouching figures huddled together on the roof.\n\n\"My old clothes--stuffed with rags--but they won't tumble to it for\nsome time. Come, Anne, we've got to try desperate means.\"\n\nHand in hand, we raced across the island. Only a narrow channel of\nwater divided it from the shore on that side.\n\n\"We've got to swim for it. Can you swim at all, Anne? Not that it\nmatters. I can get you across. It's the wrong side for a boat----too\nmany rocks, but the right side for swimming, and the right side\nfor Livingstone.\"", "\"I can swim a little--farther than that. What's the danger, Harry?\"\nFor I had seen the grim look on his face. \"Sharks?\"\n\n\"No, you little goose. Sharks live in the sea. But you're sharp,\nAnne. Crocs, that's the trouble.\"\n\n\"Crocodiles?\"\n\n\"Yes, don't think of them--or say your prayers, whichever you feel\ninclined.\"\n\nWe plunged in. My prayers must have been efficacious, for we\nreached the shore without adventure, and drew ourselves up wet and\ndripping on the bank.\n\n\"Now for Livingstone. It's rough going, I'm afraid, and wet clothes\nwon't make it any better. But it's got to be done.\"\n\nThat walk was a nightmare. My wet skirts flapped round my legs,\nand my stockings were soon torn off by the thorns. Finally I\nstopped, utterly exhausted. Harry came back to me.\n\n\"Hold up, honey. I'll carry you for a bit.\"\n\nThat was the way I came into Livingstone, slung across his shoulder\nlike a sack of coals. How he did it for all that way, I don't know.\nThe first faint light of dawn was just breaking. Harry's friend\nwas a young man of twenty odd who kept a store of native curios.\nHis name was Ned--perhaps he had another, but I never heard it. He\ndidn't seem in the least surprised to see Harry walk in, dripping\nwet, holding an equally dripping female by the hand. Men are very\nwonderful.\n\nHe gave us food to eat, and hot coffee, and got our clothes dried\nfor us whilst we rolled ourselves in Manchester blankets of gaudy\nhue. In the tiny back room of the hut we were safe from observation\nwhilst he departed to make judicious inquiries as to what had\nbecome of Sir Eustace's party, and whether any of them were still\nat the hotel.\n\nIt was then that I informed Harry that nothing would induce me to\ngo to Beira. I never meant to, anyway, but now all reason for such\nproceedings had vanished. The point of the plan had been that my\nenemies believed me dead. Now that they knew I wasn't dead, my\ngoing to Beira would do no good whatever.", "They could easily follow\nme there and murder me quietly. I should have no one to protect\nme. It was finally arranged that I should join Suzanne, wherever\nshe was, and devote all my energies to taking care of myself. On\nno account was I to seek adventures or endeavour to checkmate the\n\"Colonel.\"\n\nI was to remain quietly with her and await instructions from Harry.\nThe diamonds were to be deposited in the Bank at Kimberley under\nthe name of Parker.\n\n\"There's one thing,\" I said thoughtfully, \"we ought to have a code\nof some kind. We don't want to be hoodwinked again by messages\npurporting to come from one to the other.\"\n\n\"That's easy enough. Any message that comes _genuinely_ from me\nwill have the word 'and' crossed out in it.\"\n\n\"Without trade-mark, none genuine,\" I murmured. \"What about wires?\"\n\n\"Any wires from me will be signed 'Andy.'\"\n\n\"Train will be in before long, Harry,\" said Ned, putting his head\nin and withdrawing it immediately.\n\nI stood up.\n\n\"And shall I marry a nice steady man if I find one?\" I asked\ndemurely.\n\nHarry came close to me.\n\n\"My God! Anne, if you ever marry any one else but me, I'll wring\nhis neck. And as for you----\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, pleasurably excited.\n\n\"I shall carry you away and beat you black and blue!\"\n\n\"What a delightful husband I have chosen,\" I said satirically. \"And\ndoesn't he change his mind overnight!\"\n\n_(Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)_\n\n\nAs I remarked once before, I am essentially a man of peace. I yearn\nfor a quiet life--and that's just the one thing I don't seem able\nto have. I am always in the middle of storms and alarms. The relief\nof getting away from Pagett with his incessant nosing out of\nintrigues was enormous, and Miss Pettigrew is certainly a useful\ncreature. Although there is nothing of the houri about her, one or\ntwo of her accomplishments are invaluable. It is true that I had\na touch of liver at Bulawayo and behaved like a bear in consequence,\nbut I had had a disturbed night in the train.", "At 3 a.m. an\nexquisitely dressed young man looking like a musical-comedy hero\nof the Wild West entered my compartment and asked where I was\ngoing. Disregarding my first murmur of \"Tea--and for God's sake\ndon't put sugar in it,\" he repeated his question, laying stress on\nthe fact that he was not a waiter but an Immigration officer. I\nfinally succeeded in satisfying him that I was suffering from no\ninfectious disease, that I was visiting Rhodesia from the purest\nof motives, and further gratified him with my full Christian names\nand my place of birth. I then endeavoured to snatch a little sleep,\nbut some officious ass aroused me at 5.30 with a cup of liquid\nsugar which he called tea. I don't think I threw it at him, but I\nknow that that was what I wanted to do. He brought me unsugared\ntea, stone cold, at 6, and I then fell asleep utterly exhausted,\nto awaken just outside Bulawayo and be landed with a beastly wooden\ngiraffe, all legs and neck!\n\nBut for these small contretemps, all had been going smoothly. And\nthen fresh calamity befell.\n\nIt was the night of our arrival at the Falls. I was dictating to\nMiss Pettigrew in my sitting-room, when suddenly Mrs. Blair burst\nin without a word of excuse and wearing most compromising attire.\n\n\"Where's Anne?\" she cried.\n\nA nice question to ask. As though I were responsible for the girl.\nWhat did she expect Miss Pettigrew to think? That I was in the\nhabit of producing Anne Beddingfeld from my pocket at midnight or\nthereabouts? Very compromising for a man in my position.\n\n\"I presume,\" I said coldly, \"that she is in her bed.\"\n\nI cleared my throat and glanced at Miss Pettigrew, to show that I\nwas ready to resume dictating. I hoped Mrs. Blair would take the\nhint. She did nothing of the kind. Instead she sank into a chair\nand waved a slippered foot in an agitated manner.\n\n\"She's not in her room. I've been there. I had a dream--a terrible\ndream--that she was in some awful danger, and I got up and went to\nher room, just to reassure myself, you know.", "She wasn't there and\nher bed hadn't been slept in.\"\n\nShe looked at me appealingly.\n\n\"What shall I do, Sir Eustace?\"\n\nRepressing the desire to reply, \"Go to bed, and don't worry over\nnothing. An able-bodied young woman like Anne Beddingfeld is\nperfectly well able to take care of herself,\" I frowned judicially.\n\n\"What does Race say about it?\"\n\nWhy should Race have it all his own way? Let him have some of the\ndisadvantages as well as the advantages of female society.\n\n\"I can't find him anywhere.\"\n\nShe was evidently making a night of it. I sighed and sat down in\na chair.\n\n\"I don't quite see the reason for your agitation,\" I said patiently.\n\n\"My dream----\"\n\n\"That curry we had for dinner!\"\n\n\"Oh, Sir Eustace!\"\n\nThe woman was quite indignant. And yet everybody knows that\nnightmares are a direct result of injudicious eating.\n\n\"After all,\" I continued persuasively, \"why shouldn't Anne\nBeddingfeld and Race go out for a little stroll without having the\nwhole hotel aroused about it?\"\n\n\"You think they've just gone out for a stroll together? But it's\nafter midnight!\"\n\n\"One does these foolish things when one is young,\" I murmured,\n\"though Race is certainly old enough to know better.\"\n\n\"Do you really think so?\"\n\n\"I dare say they've run away to make a match of it,\" I continued\nsoothingly, though fully aware that I was making an idiotic\nsuggestion. For, after all, at a place like this, where is there\nto run away to?\n\nI don't know how much longer I should have gone on making feeble\nremarks, but at that moment Race himself walked in upon us. At any\nrate, I had been partly right--_he_ had been out for a stroll, but\nhe hadn't taken Anne with him. However, I had been quite wrong in\nmy way of dealing with the situation. I was soon shown that. Race\nhad the whole hotel turned upside-down in three minutes. I've never\nseen a man more upset.\n\nThe thing is very extraordinary. Where did the girl go? She walked\nout of the hotel, fully dressed, about ten minutes past eleven,\nand she was never seen again.", "The idea of suicide seems impossible.\nShe was one of those energetic young women who are in love with\nlife, and have not the faintest intention of quitting it. There\nwas no train either way until midday on the morrow, so she can't\nhave left the place. Then where the devil is she?\n\nRace is almost beside himself, poor fellow. He has left no stone\nunturned. All the D.C.'s, or whatever they call themselves, for\nhundreds of miles round have been pressed into the service. The\nnative trackers have run about on all fours. Everything that can\nbe done is being done--but no sign of Anne Beddingfeld. The accepted\ntheory is that she walked in her sleep. There are signs on the path\nnear the bridge which seem to show that the girl walked deliberately\noff the edge. If so, of course, she must have been dashed to pieces\non the rocks below. Unfortunately, most of the footprints were\nobliterated by a party of tourists who chose to walk that way early\non the Monday morning.\n\nI don't know that it's a very satisfactory theory. In my young\ndays, I always was told that sleep-walkers couldn't hurt\nthemselves--that their own sixth sense took care of them. I don't\nthink the theory satisfies Mrs. Blair either.\n\nI can't make that woman out. Her whole attitude towards Race has\nchanged. She watches him now like a cat a mouse, and she makes\nobvious efforts to bring herself to be civil to him. And they used\nto be such friends. Altogether she is unlike herself, nervous,\nhysterical, starting and jumping at the least sound. I am beginning\nto think that it is high time I went to Jo'burg.\n\nA rumour came along yesterday of a mysterious island somewhere up\nthe river, with a man and a girl on it. Race got very excited. It\nturned out to be all a mare's-nest, however. The man had been there\nfor years, and is well known to the manager of the hotel. He totes\nparties up and down the river in the season and points out\ncrocodiles and a stray hippopotamus or so to them.", "I believe that\nhe keeps a tame one which is trained to bite pieces out of the boat\non occasions. Then he fends it off with a boat-hook, and the party\nfeel they have really got to the back of beyond at last. How long\nthe girl has been there is not definitely known, but it seems\npretty clear that she can't be Anne, and there is a certain delicacy\nin interfering in other people's affairs. If I were this young\nfellow, I should certainly kick Race off the island if he came\nasking questions about my love affairs.\n\n_Later._\n\nIt is definitely settled that I go to Jo'burg to-morrow. Race urges\nme to do so. Things are getting unpleasant there, by all I hear,\nbut I might as well go before they get worse. I dare say I shall\nbe shot by a striker, anyway. Mrs. Blair was to have accompanied\nme, but at the last minute she changed her mind and decided to stay\non at the Falls. It seems as though she couldn't bear to take her\neyes off Race. She came to me to-night and said, with some\nhesitation, that she had a favour to ask. Would I take charge of\nher souvenirs for her?\n\n\"Not the animals?\" I asked, in lively alarm. I always felt that I\nshould get stuck with those beastly animals sooner or later.\n\nIn the end we effected a compromise. I took charge of two small\nwooden boxes for her which contained fragile articles. The animals\nare to be packed by the local store in vast crates and sent to Cape\nTown by rail, where Pagett will see to their being stored.\n\nThe people who are packing them say that they are of a particularly\nawkward shape (!), and that special cases will have to be made. I\npointed out to Mrs. Blair that by the time she has got them home\nthose animals will have cost her easily a pound apiece!\n\nPagett is straining at the leash to rejoin me in Jo'burg. I shall\nmake an excuse of Mrs.", "Blair's cases to keep him in Cape Town. I\nhave written him that he must receive the cases and see to their\nsafe disposal, as they contain rare curios of immense value.\n\nSo all is settled, and I and Miss Pettigrew go off into the blue\ntogether. And any one who has seen Miss Pettigrew will admit that\nit is perfectly respectable.\n\n  Johannesburg,\n\n  _March 6th._\n\nThere is something about the state of things here that is not at\nall healthy. To use the well-known phrase that I have so often\nread, we are all living on the edge of a volcano. Bands of strikers,\nor so-called strikers, patrol the streets and scowl at one in a\nmurderous fashion. They are picking out the bloated capitalists\nready for when the massacres begin, I suppose. You can't ride in\na taxi--if you do, strikers pull you out again. And the hotels hint\npleasantly that when the food gives out they will fling you out on\nthe mat!\n\nI met Reeves, my labour friend of the _Kilmorden,_ last night. He\nhas cold feet worse than any man I ever saw. He's like all the rest\nof these people, they make inflammatory speeches of enormous\nlength, solely for political purposes, and then wish they hadn't.\nHe's busy now going about and saying he didn't really do it. When\nI met him, he was just off to Cape Town, where he meditates making\na three days' speech in Dutch, vindicating himself, and pointing\nout that the things he said really meant something entirely\ndifferent. I am thankful that I do not have to sit in the\nLegislative Assembly of South Africa. The House of Commons is bad\nenough, but at least we have only one language, and some slight\nrestriction as to length of speeches. When I went to the Assembly\nbefore leaving Cape Town, I listened to a gray-haired gentleman\nwith a drooping moustache who looked exactly like the Mock Turtle\nin _Alice in Wonderland._\n\nHe dropped out his words one by one in a particularly melancholy\nfashion. Every now and then he galvanized himself to further\nefforts by ejaculating something that sounded like \"Platt Skeet,\"\nuttered _fortissimo_ and in marked contrast to the rest of his\ndelivery.", "When he did this, half his audience yelled \"Whoof,\nwhoof!\" which is possibly Dutch for \"Hear, hear,\" and the other\nhalf woke up with a start from the pleasant nap they had been\nhaving. I was given to understand that the gentleman had been\nspeaking for at least three days. They must have a lot of patience\nin South Africa.\n\nI have invented endless jobs to keep Pagett in Cape Town, but at\nlast the fertility of my imagination has given out, and he joins\nme to-morrow in the spirit of the faithful dog who comes to die by\nhis master's side. And I was getting on so well with my Reminiscences\ntoo! I had invented some extraordinarily witty things that the\nstrike leaders said to me and I said to the strike leaders.\n\nThis morning I was interviewed by a Government official. He was\nurbane, persuasive and mysterious in turn. To begin with, he\nalluded to my exalted position and importance and suggested that\nI should remove myself, or be removed by him, to Pretoria.\n\n\"You expect trouble, then?\" I asked.\n\nHis reply was so worded as to have no meaning whatsoever, so I\ngathered that they were expecting serious trouble. I suggested to\nhim that his Government were letting things go rather far.\n\n\"There is such a thing as giving a man enough rope, and letting\nhim hang himself, Sir Eustace.\"\n\n\"Oh, quite so, quite so.\"\n\n\"It is not the strikers themselves who are causing the trouble.\nThere is some organization at work behind them. Arms and explosives\nhave been pouring in, and we have made a haul of certain documents\nwhich throw a good deal of light on the methods adopted to import\nthem. There is a regular code. Potatoes mean 'detonators,'\ncauliflower, 'rifles,' other vegetables stand for various\nexplosives.\"\n\n\"That's very interesting,\" I commended.\n\n\"More than that, Sir Eustace, we have every reason to believe that\nthe man who runs the whole show, the directing genius of the\naffair, is at this minute in Johannesburg.\"\n\nHe stared at me so hard that I began to fear that he suspected me\nof being the man.", "I broke out into a cold perspiration at the\nthought, and began to regret that I had ever conceived the idea of\ninspecting a miniature revolution at first hand.\n\n\"No trains are running from Jo'burg to Pretoria,\" he continued.\n\"But I can arrange to send you over by private car. In case you\nshould be stopped on the way I can provide you with two separate\npasses, one issued by the Union Government, and the other stating\nthat you are an English visitor who has nothing whatsoever to do\nwith the Union.\"\n\n\"One for your people, and one for the strikers, eh?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nThe project did not appeal to me--I know what happens in a case of\nthat kind. You get flustered and mix the things up. I should hand\nthe wrong pass to the wrong person, and it would end in my being\nsummarily shot by a bloodthirsty rebel, or one of the supporters\nof law and order whom I notice guarding the streets wearing bowler\nhats and smoking pipes, with rifles tucked carelessly under their\narms. Besides, what should I do with myself in Pretoria? Admire\nthe architecture of the Union buildings and listen to the echoes\nof the shooting round Johannesburg? I should be penned up there\nGod knows how long. They've blown up the railway line already, I\nhear. It isn't even as if one could get a drink there. They put\nthe place under martial law two days ago.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" I said, \"you don't seem to realize that I'm\nstudying conditions on the Rand. How the devil am I going to study\nthem from Pretoria? I appreciate your care for my safety, but don't\nyou worry about me. I shall be all right.\"\n\n\"I warn you, Sir Eustace, that the food question is already\nserious.\"\n\n\"A little fasting will improve my figure,\" I said, with a sigh.\n\nWe were interrupted by a telegram being handed to me. I read it\nwith amazement:\n\n\"Anne is safe. Here with me at Kimberley. Suzanne Blair.\"\n\nI don't think I ever really believed in the annihilation of Anne.", "There is something peculiarly indestructible about that young\nwoman--she is like the patent balls that one gives to terriers. She\nhas an extraordinary knack of turning up smiling. I still don't\nsee why it was necessary for her to walk out of the hotel in the\nmiddle of the night in order to get to Kimberley. There was no\ntrain, anyway. She must have put on a pair of angel's wings and\nflown there. And I don't suppose she will ever explain. Nobody\ndoes--to me. I always have to guess. It becomes monotonous after a\nwhile. The exigencies of journalism are at the bottom of it, I\nsuppose. \"How I shot the rapids,\" by our Special Correspondent.\n\nI refolded the telegram and got rid of my Governmental friend. I\ndon't like the prospect of being hungry, but I'm not alarmed for\nmy personal safety. Smuts is perfectly capable of dealing with the\nrevolution. But I would give a considerable sum of money for a\ndrink! I wonder if Pagett will have the sense to bring a bottle of\nwhisky with him when he arrives to-morrow?\n\nI put on my hat and went out, intending to buy a few souvenirs.\nThe curio-shops in Jo'burg are rather pleasant. I was just studying\na window full of imposing karosses, when a man coming out of the\nshop cannoned into me. To my surprise it turned out to be Race.\n\nI can't flatter myself that he looked pleased to see me. As a\nmatter of fact, he looked distinctly annoyed, but I insisted on\nhis accompanying me back to the hotel. I get tired of having no\none but Miss Pettigrew to talk to.\n\n\"I had no idea you were in Jo'burg,\" I said chattily. \"When did\nyou arrive?\"\n\n\"Last night.\"\n\n\"Where are you staying?\"\n\n\"With friends.\"\n\nHe was disposed to be extraordinarily taciturn, and seemed to be\nembarrassed by my questions.\n\n\"I hope they keep poultry,\" I remarked. \"A diet of new-laid eggs\nand the occasional slaughtering of an old cock will be decidedly\nagreeable soon from all I hear.\"", "\"By the way,\" I said, when we were back in the hotel, \"have you\nheard that Miss Beddingfeld is alive and kicking?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"She gave us quite a fright,\" I said airily. \"Where the devil did\nshe go to that night, that's what I'd like to know.\"\n\n\"She was on the island all the time.\"\n\n\"Which island? Not the one with the young man on it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How very improper,\" I said. \"Pagett will be quite shocked. He\nalways did disapprove of Anne Beddingfeld. I suppose that was the\nyoung man she originally intended to meet in Durban?\"\n\n\"I don't think so.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me anything you don't want to,\" I said, by way of\nencouraging him.\n\n\"I fancy that this is a young man we should all be very glad to\nlay our hands on.\"\n\n\"Not----?\" I cried, in rising excitement.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Harry Rayburn, _alias_ Harry Lucas--that's his real name, you know.\nHe's given us all the slip once more, but we're bound to rope him\nin soon.\"\n\n\"Dear me, dear me,\" I murmured.\n\n\"We don't suspect the girl of complicity in any case. On her side\nit's--just a love-affair.\"\n\nI always did think Race was in love with Anne. The way he said\nthose last words made me feel sure of it.\n\n\"She's gone to Beira,\" he continued rather hastily.\n\n\"Indeed,\" I said, staring. \"How do you know?\"\n\n\"She wrote to me from Bulawayo, telling me she was going home that\nway. The best thing she can do, poor child.\"\n\n\"Somehow, I don't fancy she is in Beira,\" I said meditatively.\n\n\"She was just starting when she wrote.\"\n\nI was puzzled. Somebody was clearly lying. Without stopping to\nreflect that Anne might have excellent reasons for her misleading\nstatements, I gave myself up to the pleasure of scoring off Race.\nHe is always so cocksure. I took the telegram from my pocket and\nhanded it to him.\n\n\"Then how do you explain this?\" I asked nonchalantly.\n\nHe seemed dumbfounded.\n\n\"She said she was just starting for Beira,\" he said, in a dazed\nvoice.", "I know that Race is supposed to be clever. He is, in my opinion,\nrather a stupid man. It never seemed to occur to him that girls do\nnot always tell the truth.\n\n\"Kimberley too. What are they doing there?\" he muttered.\n\n\"Yes, that surprised me. I should have thought Miss Anne would have\nbeen in the thick of it here, gathering copy for the _Daily\nBudget.\"_\n\n\"Kimberley,\" he said again. The place seemed to upset him. \"There's\nnothing to see there--the pits aren't being worked.\"\n\n\"You know what women are,\" I said vaguely.\n\nHe shook his head and went off. I have evidently given him something\nto think about.\n\nNo sooner had he departed than my Government official reappeared.\n\n\"I hope you will forgive me for troubling you again, Sir Eustace,\"\nhe apologized. \"But there are one or two questions I should like\nto ask you.\"\n\n\"Certainly, my dear fellow,\" I said cheerfully. \"Ask away.\"\n\n\"It concerns your secretary----\"\n\n\"I know nothing about him,\" I said hastily. \"He foisted himself\nupon me in London, robbed me of valuable papers--for which I shall\nbe hauled over the coals--and disappeared like a conjuring trick at\nCape Town. It's true that I was at the Falls at the same time as\nhe was, but I was at the hotel, and he was on an island. I can\nassure you that I never set eyes upon him the whole time that I\nwas there.\"\n\nI paused for breath.\n\n\"You misunderstand me. It was of your other secretary that I\nspoke.\"\n\n\"What? Pagett?\" I cried, in lively astonishment. \"He's been with\nme eight years--a most trustworthy fellow.\"\n\nMy interlocutor smiled.\n\n\"We are still at cross-purposes. I refer to the lady.\"\n\n\"Miss Pettigrew?\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes. She has been seen coming out of Agrasato's Native Curio-shop.\"\n\n\"God bless my soul!\" I interrupted. \"I was going into that place\nmyself this afternoon. You might have caught _me_ coming out!\"\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any innocent thing that one can do in\nJo'burg without being suspected for it.\n\n\"Ah! but she has been there more than once--and in rather doubtful\ncircumstances.", "I may as well tell you--in confidence, Sir Eustace--that\nthe place is suspected of being a well-known rendezvous used by\nthe secret organization behind this revolution. That is why I\nshould be glad to hear all that you can tell me about this lady.\nWhere and how did you come to engage her?\"\n\n\"She was lent to me,\" I replied coldly, \"by your own Government.\"\n\nHe collapsed utterly.\n\n_(Anne's Narrative Resumed)_\n\n\nAs soon as I got to Kimberley I wired to Suzanne.\n\nShe joined me there with the utmost dispatch, heralding her arrival\nwith telegrams sent off _en route._ I was awfully surprised to find\nthat she really was fond of me--I thought I had been just a new\nsensation, but she positively fell on my neck and wept when we met.\n\nWhen we had recovered from our emotion a little, I sat down on the\nbed and told her the whole story from A to Z.\n\n\"You always did suspect Colonel Race,\" she said thoughtfully, when\nI had finished. \"I didn't until the night you disappeared. I liked\nhim so much all along and thought he would make such a nice husband\nfor you. Oh, Anne, dear, don't be cross, but how do you know that\nthis young man of yours is telling the truth? You believe every\nword he says.\"\n\n\"Of course I do,\" I cried indignantly.\n\n\"But what is there in him that attracts you so? I don't see that\nthere's anything in him at all except his rather reckless good\nlooks and his modern Sheik-cum-Stone-Age love-making.\"\n\nI poured out the vials of my wrath upon Suzanne for some minutes.\n\n\"Just because you're comfortably married and getting fat, you've\nforgotten that there's any such thing as romance,\" I ended.\n\n\"Oh, I'm not getting fat, Anne. All the worry I've had about you\nlately must have worn me to a shred.\"\n\n\"You look particularly well nourished,\" I said coldly. \"I should\nsay you must have put on about half a stone.\"\n\n\"And I don't know that I'm so comfortably married either,\" continued\nSuzanne in a melancholy voice.", "\"I've been having the most dreadful\ncables from Clarence ordering me to come home at once. At last I\ndidn't answer them, and now I haven't heard for over a fortnight.\"\n\nI'm afraid I didn't take Suzanne's matrimonial troubles very\nseriously. She will be able to get round Clarence all right when\nthe times comes. I turned the conversation to the subject of the\ndiamonds.\n\nSuzanne looked at me with a dropped jaw.\n\n\"I must explain, Anne. You see, as soon as I began to suspect\nColonel Race, I was terribly upset about the diamonds. I wanted to\nstay on at the Falls in case he might have kidnapped you somewhere\nclose by, but didn't know what to do about the diamonds. I was\nafraid to keep them in my possession----\"\n\nSuzanne looked round her uneasily, as though she feared the walls\nmight have ears, and then whispered vehemently in my ear.\n\n\"A distinctly good idea,\" I approved. \"At the time, that is. It's\na bit awkward now. What did Sir Eustace do with the cases?\"\n\n\"The big ones were sent down to Cape Town. I heard from Pagett\nbefore I left the Falls, and he enclosed the receipt for their\nstorage. He's leaving Cape Town to-day, by the by, to join Sir\nEustace in Johannesburg.\"\n\n\"I see,\" I said thoughtfully. \"And the small ones, where are they?\"\n\n\"I suppose Sir Eustace has got them with him.\"\n\nI turned the matter over in my mind.\n\n\"Well,\" I said at last, \"it's awkward--but it's safe enough. We'd\nbetter do nothing for the present.\"\n\nSuzanne looked at me with a little smile.\n\n\"You don't like doing nothing, do you, Anne?\"\n\n\"Not very much,\" I replied honestly.\n\nThe one thing I could do was to get hold of a time-table and see\nwhat time Guy Pagett's train would pass through Kimberley. I found\nthat it would arrive at 5.40 on the following afternoon and depart\nagain at 6. I wanted to see Pagett as soon as possible, and that\nseemed to me a good opportunity. The situation on the Rand was\ngetting very serious, and it might be a long time before I got\nanother chance.", "The only thing that livened up the day was a wire dispatched from\nJohannesburg. A most innocent-sounding telegram:\n\n\"Arrived safely. All going well. Eric here, also Eustace, but not\nGuy. Remain where you are for the present. Andy.\"\n\nEric was our pseudonym for Race. I chose it because it is a name\nI dislike exceedingly. There was clearly nothing to be done until\nI could see Pagett. Suzanne employed herself in sending off a long\nsoothing cable to the far-off Clarence. She became quite sentimental\nover him. In her way--which of course is quite different from me\nand Harry--she is really fond of Clarence.\n\n\"I do wish he was here, Anne,\" she gulped. \"It's such a long time\nsince I've seen him.\"\n\n\"Have some face cream,\" I said soothingly.\n\nSuzanne rubbed a little on the tip of her charming nose.\n\n\"I shall want some more face cream soon too,\" she remarked, \"and\nyou can only get this kind in Paris.\" She sighed. \"Paris!\"\n\n\"Suzanne,\" I said, \"very soon you'll have had enough of South\nAfrica and adventure.\"\n\n\"I should like a really nice hat,\" admitted Suzanne wistfully.\n\"Shall I come with you to meet Guy Pagett to-morrow?\"\n\n\"I prefer to go alone. He'd be shyer speaking before two of us.\"\n\nSo it came about that I was standing in the doorway of the hotel\non the following afternoon, struggling with a recalcitrant parasol\nthat refused to go up, whilst Suzanne lay peacefully on her bed\nwith a book and a basket of fruit.\n\nAccording to the hotel porter, the train was on its good behaviour\nto-day and would be almost on time, though he was extremely doubtful\nwhether it would ever get through to Johannesburg. The line had\nbeen blown up, so he solemnly assured me. It sounded cheerful!\n\nThe train drew in just ten minutes late. Everybody tumbled out on\nthe platform and began walking up and down feverishly. I had no\ndifficulty in espying Pagett. I accosted him eagerly. He gave his\nusual nervous start at seeing me--somewhat accentuated this time.", "\"Dear me, Miss Beddingfeld, I understood that you had disappeared.\"\n\n\"I have reappeared again,\" I told him solemnly. \"And how are you,\nMr. Pagett?\"\n\n\"Very well, thank you--looking forward to taking up my work again\nwith Sir Eustace.\"\n\n\"Mr. Pagett,\" I said, \"there is something I want to ask you. I hope\nthat you won't be offended, but a lot hangs on it, more than you\ncan possibly guess. I want to know what you were doing at Marlow\non the 8th of January last?\"\n\nHe started violently.\n\n\"Really, Miss Beddingfeld--I--indeed----\"\n\n\"You _were_ there, weren't you?\"\n\n\"I--for reasons of my own I was in the neighbourhood, yes.\"\n\n\"Won't you tell me what those reasons were?\"\n\n\"Sir Eustace has not already told you?\"\n\n\"Sir Eustace? Does he know?\"\n\n\"I am almost sure that he does. I hoped he had not recognized me,\nbut from the hints he has let drop, and his remarks, I fear it is\nonly too certain. In any case, I meant to make a clean breast of\nthe matter and offer him my resignation. He is a peculiar man, Miss\nBeddingfeld, with an abnormal sense of humour. It seems to amuse\nhim to keep me on tenter-hooks. All the time, I dare say, he was\nperfectly well aware of the true facts. Possibly he has known them\nfor years.\"\n\nI hoped that sooner or later I should be able to understand what\nPagett was talking about. He went on fluently:\n\n\"It is difficult for a man of Sir Eustace's standing to put himself\nin my position. I know that I was in the wrong, but it seemed a\nharmless deception. I would have thought it better taste on his\npart to have tackled me outright--instead of indulging in covert\njokes at my expense.\"\n\nA whistle blew, and the people began to surge back into the train.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Pagett,\" I broke in, \"I'm sure I quite agree with all\nyou're saying about Sir Eustace. _But why did you go to Marlow?\"_\n\n\"It was wrong of me, but natural under the circumstances--yes, I\nstill feel natural under the circumstances.\"", "\"What circumstances?\" I cried desperately.\n\nFor the first time Pagett seemed to recognize that I was asking\nhim a question. His mind detached itself from the peculiarities of\nSir Eustace and his own justification and came to rest on me.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Miss Beddingfeld,\" he said stiffly, \"but I fail\nto see your concern in the matter.\"\n\nHe was back in the train now, leaning down to speak to me. I felt\ndesperate. What could one do with a man like that?\n\n\"Of course, if it's so dreadful that you'd be ashamed to speak of\nit to me----\" I began spitefully.\n\nAt last I had found the right stop. Pagett stiffened and flushed.\n\n\"Dreadful? Ashamed? I don't understand you.\"\n\n\"Then tell me.\"\n\nIn three short sentences he told me. At last I knew Pagett's\nsecret! It was not in the least what I expected.\n\nI walked slowly back to the hotel. There a wire was handed to me.\nI tore it open. It contained full and definite instructions for me\nto proceed forthwith to Johannesburg, or rather to a station this\nside of Johannesburg, where I should be met by a car. It was\nsigned, not Andy, but Harry.\n\nI sat down in a chair to do some very serious thinking.\n\n  _(From the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)_\n\n\n  Johannesburg,\n\n  _March 7th._\n\nPagett has arrived. He is in a blue funk of course. Suggested at\nonce that we should go off to Pretoria. Then, when I had told him\nkindly but firmly that we were going to remain here, he went to\nthe other extreme, wished he had his rifle here, and began bucking\nabout some bridge he guarded during the Great War. A railway bridge\nat Little Puddecombe junction, or something of that sort.\n\nI soon cut that short by telling him to unpack the big typewriter.\nI thought that that would keep him employed for some time, because\nthe typewriter was sure to have gone wrong--it always does--and he\nwould have to take it somewhere to be mended. But I had forgotten\nPagett's powers of being in the right.", "\"I've already unpacked all the cases, Sir Eustace. The typewriter\nis in perfect condition.\"\n\n\"What do you mean--all the cases?\"\n\n\"The two small cases as well.\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't be so officious, Pagett. Those small cases\nwere no business of yours. They belong to Mrs. Blair.\"\n\nPagett looked crestfallen. He hates to make a mistake.\n\n\"So you can just pack them up again neatly,\" I continued. \"After\nthat you can go out and look around you. Jo'burg will probably be\na heap of smoking ruins by to-morrow, so it may be your last\nchance.\"\n\nI thought that that would get rid of him successfully for the\nmorning, at any rate.\n\n\"There is something I want to say to you when you have the leisure,\nSir Eustace.\"\n\n\"I haven't got it now,\" I said hastily. \"At this minute I have\nabsolutely no leisure whatsoever.\"\n\nPagett retired.\n\n\"By the way,\" I called after him, \"what was there in those cases\nof Mrs. Blair's?\"\n\n\"Some fur rugs, and a couple of fur--hats, I think.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" I assented. \"She bought them on the train. They\n_are_ hats--of a kind--though I hardly wonder at your not recognizing\nthem. I dare say she's going to wear one of them at Ascot. What\nelse was there?\"\n\n\"Some rolls of films and some baskets--a lot of baskets----\"\n\n\"There would be,\" I assured him. \"Mrs. Blair is the kind of woman\nwho never buys less than a dozen or so of anything.\"\n\n\"I think that's all, Sir Eustace, except some miscellaneous odds\nand ends, a motor-veil and some odd gloves--that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"If you hadn't been a born idiot, Pagett, you would have seen from\nthe start that those couldn't possibly be my belongings.\"\n\n\"I thought some of them might belong to Miss Pettigrew.\"\n\n\"Ah, that reminds me--what do you mean by picking me out such a\ndoubtful character as a secretary?\"\n\nAnd I told him about the searching cross-examination I had been\nput through. Immediately I was sorry, I saw a glint in his eye that\nI knew only too well.", "I changed the conversation hurriedly. But it\nwas too late. Pagett was on the war-path.\n\nHe next proceeded to bore me with a long pointless story about the\n_Kilmorden._ It was about a roll of films and a wager. The roll of\nfilms being thrown through a porthole in the middle of the night\nby some steward who ought to have known better. I hate horse-play.\nI told Pagett so, and he began to tell me the story all over again.\nHe tells a story extremely badly, anyway. It was a long time before\nI could make head or tail of this one.\n\nI did not see him again until lunch-time. Then he came in brimming\nover with excitement, like a bloodhound on the scent. I never have\ncared for bloodhounds. The upshot of it all was that he had seen\nRayburn.\n\n\"What?\" I cried, startled.\n\nYes, he had caught sight of some one whom he was sure was Rayburn\ncrossing the street. Pagett had followed him.\n\n\"And who do you think I saw him stop and speak to? Miss Pettigrew!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir Eustace. And that's not all. I've been making inquiries\nabout her----\"\n\n\"Wait a bit. What happened to Rayburn?\"\n\n\"He and Miss Pettigrew went into that corner curio-shop----\"\n\nI uttered an involuntary exclamation. Pagett stopped inquiringly.\n\n\"Nothing,\" I said. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"I waited outside for ages--but they didn't come out. At last I went\nin. Sir Eustace, there was no one in the shop! There must be\nanother way out.\"\n\nI stared at him.\n\n\"As I was saying, I came back to the hotel and made some inquiries\nabout Miss Pettigrew.\" Pagett lowered his voice and breathed hard\nas he always does when he wants to be confidential. \"Sir Eustace,\na man was seen coming out of her room last night.\"\n\nI raised my eyebrows.\n\n\"And I always regarded her as a lady of such eminent respectability,\"\nI murmured.\n\nPagett went on without heeding.\n\n\"I went straight up and searched her room. What do you think I\nfound?\"\n\nI shook my head.", "\"This!\"\n\nPagett held up a safety razor and a stick of shaving soap.\n\n\"What should a woman want with these?\"\n\nI don't suppose Pagett ever reads the advertisements in the\nhigh-class ladies' papers. I do. Whilst not proposing to argue with\nhim on the subject, I refused to accept the presence of the razor\nas proof positive of Miss Pettigrew's sex. Pagett is so hopelessly\nbehind the times. I should not have been at all surprised if he\nhad produced a cigarette-case to support his theory. However, even\nPagett has his limits.\n\n\"You're not convinced, Sir Eustace. What do you say to _this?\"_\n\nI inspected the article which he dangled aloft triumphantly.\n\n\"It looks like hair,\" I remarked distastefully.\n\n\"It is hair. I think it's what they call a toupee.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" I commented.\n\n\"Now are you convinced that that Pettigrew woman is a man in\ndisguise?\"\n\n\"Really, my dear Pagett, I think I am. I might have known it by\nher feet.\"\n\n\"Then that's that. And now, Sir Eustace, I want to speak to you\nabout my private affairs. I cannot doubt, from your hints and your\ncontinual allusions to the time I was in Florence, that you have\nfound me out.\"\n\nAt last the mystery of what Pagett did in Florence is going to be\nrevealed!\n\n\"Make a clean breast of it, my dear fellow,\" I said kindly. \"Much\nthe best way.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Sir Eustace.\"\n\n\"Is it her husband? Annoying fellows, husbands. Always turning up\nwhen they're least expected.\"\n\n\"I fail to follow you, Sir Eustace. Whose husband?\"\n\n\"The lady's husband.\"\n\n\"What lady?\"\n\n\"God bless my soul, Pagett, the lady you met in Florence. There\nmust have been a lady. Don't tell me that you merely robbed a\nchurch or stabbed an Italian in the back because you didn't like\nhis face.\"\n\n\"I am quite at a loss to understand you, Sir Eustace. I suppose\nyou are joking.\"\n\n\"I am an amusing fellow sometimes, when I take the trouble, but I\ncan assure you that I am not trying to be funny this minute.\"\n\n\"I hoped that as I was a good way off you had not recognized me,\nSir Eustace.\"", "\"Recognized you where?\"\n\n\"At Marlow, Sir Eustace?\"\n\n\"At Marlow? What the devil were you doing at Marlow?\"\n\n\"I thought you understood that----\"\n\n\"I'm beginning to understand less and less. Go back to the beginning\nof the story and start again. You went to Florence----\"\n\n\"Then you don't know after all--and you didn't recognize me!\"\n\n\"As far as I can judge, you seem to have given yourself away\nneedlessly--made a coward of by your conscience. But I shall be able\nto tell better when I've heard the whole story. Now, then, take a\ndeep breath and start again. You went to Florence----\"\n\n\"But I didn't go to Florence. That is just it.\"\n\n\"Well, where did you go, then?\"\n\n\"I went home--to Marlow.\"\n\n\"What the devil did you want to go to Marlow for?\"\n\n\"I wanted to see my wife. She was in delicate health and expecting----\"\n\n\"Your wife? But I didn't know you were married?\"\n\n\"No, Sir Eustace, that is just what I am telling you. I deceived\nyou in this matter.\"\n\n\"How long have you been married?\"\n\n\"Just over eight years. I had been married just six months when I\nbecame your secretary. I did not want to lose the post. A resident\nsecretary is not supposed to have a wife, so I suppressed the\nfact.\"\n\n\"You take my breath away,\" I remarked. \"Where has she been all\nthese years?\"\n\n\"We have had a small bungalow on the river at Marlow, quite close\nto the Mill House, for over five years.\"\n\n\"God bless my soul,\" I muttered. \"Any children?\"\n\n\"Four children, Sir Eustace.\"\n\nI gazed at him in a kind of stupor. I might have known, all along,\nthat a man like Pagett couldn't have a guilty secret. The\nrespectability of Pagett has always been my bane. That's just the\nkind of secret he would have--a wife and four children.\n\n\"Have you told this to any one else?\" I demanded at last, when I\nhad gazed at him in fascinated interest for quite a long while.\n\n\"Only Miss Beddingfeld. She came to the station at Kimberley.\"", "I continued to stare at him. He fidgeted under my glance.\n\n\"I hope, Sir Eustace, that you are not seriously annoyed?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" I said, \"I don't mind telling you here and now\nthat you've blinking well torn it!\"\n\nI went out seriously ruffled. As I passed the corner curio-shop,\nI was assailed by a sudden irresistible temptation and went in.\nThe proprietor came forward obsequiously, rubbing his hands.\n\n\"Can I show you something? Furs, curios?\"\n\n\"I want something quite out of the ordinary,\" I said. \"It's for a\nspecial occasion. Will you show me what you've got?\"\n\n\"Perhaps you will come into my back room? We have many specialties\nthere?\"\n\nThat is where I made a mistake. And I thought I was going to be so\nclever. I followed him through the swinging _portieres._\n\n  _(Anne's Narrative Resumed)_\n\n\nI had great trouble with Suzanne. She argued, she pleaded, she even\nwept before she would let me carry out my plan. But in the end I\ngot my own way. She promised to carry out my instructions to the\nletter and came down to the station to bid me a tearful farewell.\n\nI arrived at my destination the following morning early. I was met\nby a short black-bearded Dutchman whom I had never seen before. He\nhad a car waiting and we drove off. There was a queer booming in\nthe distance, and I asked him what it was. \"Guns,\" he answered\nlaconically. So there was fighting going on in Jo'burg!\n\nI gathered that our objective was a spot somewhere in the suburbs\nof the city. We turned and twisted and made several detours to get\nthere, and every minute the guns were nearer. It was an exciting\ntime. At last we stopped before a somewhat ramshackle building.\nThe door was opened by a Kafir boy. My guide signed to me to enter.\nI stood irresolute in the dingy square hall. The man passed me and\nthrew open a door.\n\n\"The young lady to see Mr. Harry Rayburn,\" he said, and laughed.\n\nThus announced, I passed in. The room was sparsely furnished and\nsmelt of cheap tobacco smoke.", "Behind a desk a man sat writing. He\nlooked up and raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"Dear me,\" he said, \"if it isn't Miss Beddingfeld!\"\n\n\"I must be seeing double,\" I apologized. \"Is it Mr. Chichester, or\nis it Miss Pettigrew? There is an extraordinary resemblance to both\nof them.\"\n\n\"Both characters are in abeyance for the moment. I have doffed my\npetticoats--and my cloth likewise. Won't you sit down?\"\n\nI accepted a seat composedly.\n\n\"It would seem,\" I remarked, \"that I have come to the wrong\naddress.\"\n\n\"From your point of view, I am afraid you have. Really, Miss\nBeddingfeld, to fall into the trap a second time!\"\n\n\"It was not very bright of me,\" I admitted meekly. Something about\nmy manner seemed to puzzle him.\n\n\"You hardly seem upset by the occurrence,\" he remarked dryly.\n\n\"Would my going into heroics have any effect upon you?\" I asked.\n\n\"It certainly would not.\"\n\n\"My great-aunt Jane always used to say that a true lady was neither\nshocked nor surprised at anything that might happen,\" I murmured\ndreamily. \"I endeavour to live up to her precepts.\"\n\nI read Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew's opinion so plainly written on\nhis face that I hastened into speech once more.\n\n\"You really are positively marvellous at make-up,\" I said\ngenerously. \"All the time you were Miss Pettigrew I never recognized\nyou--even when you broke your pencil in the shock of seeing me climb\nupon the train at Cape Town.\"\n\nHe tapped upon the desk with the pencil he was holding in his hand\nat the minute.\n\n\"All this is very well in its way, but we must get to business.\nPerhaps, Miss Beddingfeld, you can guess why we required your\npresence here?\"\n\n\"You will excuse me,\" I said, \"but I never do business with any\none but principals.\"\n\nI had read the phrase or something like it in a money-lender's\ncircular, and I was rather pleased with it. It certainly had a\ndevastating effect upon Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew. He opened his\nmouth and then shut it again. I beamed upon him.\n\n\"My great-uncle George's maxim,\" I added, as an afterthought.", "\"Great-aunt Jane's husband, you know. He made knobs for brass\nbeds.\"\n\nI doubt if Chichester-Pettigrew had ever been ragged before. He\ndidn't like it at all.\n\n\"I think you would be wise to alter your tone, young lady.\"\n\nI did not reply, but yawned--a delicate little yawn that hinted at\nintense boredom.\n\n\"What the devil----\" he began forcibly.\n\nI interrupted him.\n\n\"I can assure you it's no good shouting at me. We are only wasting\ntime here. I have no intention of talking with underlings. You will\nsave a lot of time and annoyance by taking me straight to Sir\nEustace Pedler.\"\n\n\"To----\"\n\nHe looked dumbfounded.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"Sir Eustace Pedler.\"\n\n\"I--I--excuse me----\"\n\nHe bolted from the room like a rabbit. I took advantage of the\nrespite to open my bag and powder my nose thoroughly. Also I\nsettled my hat at a more becoming angle. Then I settled myself to\nwait with patience for my enemy's return.\n\nHe reappeared in a subtly chastened mood.\n\n\"Will you come this way, Miss Beddingfeld?\"\n\nI followed him up the stairs. He knocked at the door of a room, a\nbrisk \"Come in\" sounded from inside, and he opened the door and\nmotioned to me to pass inside.\n\nSir Eustace Pedler sprang up to greet me, genial and smiling.\n\n\"Well, well, Miss Anne.\" He shook me warmly by the hand. \"I'm\ndelighted to see you. Come and sit down. Not tired after your\njourney? That's good.\"\n\nHe sat down facing me, still beaming. It left me rather at a loss.\nHis manner was so completely natural.\n\n\"Quite right to insist on being brought straight to me,\" he went\non. \"Minks is a fool. A clever actor--but a fool. That was Minks\nyou saw downstairs.\"\n\n\"Oh, really,\" I said feebly.\n\n\"And now,\" said Sir Eustace cheerfully, \"let's get down to facts.\nHow long have you known that I was the 'Colonel'?\"\n\n\"Ever since Mr. Pagett told me that he had seen you in Marlow when\nyou were supposed to be in Cannes.\"\n\nSir Eustace nodded ruefully.\n\n\"Yes, I told the fool he'd blinking well torn it.", "He didn't\nunderstand of course. His whole mind was set on whether _I'd_\nrecognized _him._ It never occurred to him to wonder what I was\ndoing down there. A piece of sheer bad luck that was. I arranged\nit all so carefully too, sending him off to Florence, telling the\nhotel I was going over to Nice for one night or possibly two. Then,\nby the time the murder was discovered, I was back again in Cannes,\nwith nobody dreaming that I'd ever left the Riviera.\"\n\nHe still spoke quite naturally and unaffectedly. I had to pinch\nmyself to understand that this was all real--that the man in front\nof me was really that deep-dyed criminal, the \"Colonel.\" I followed\nthings out in my mind.\n\n\"Then it was you who tried to throw me overboard on the _Kilmorden,\"_\nI said slowly. \"It was you that Pagett followed up on deck that\nnight?\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I apologize, my dear child, I really do. I always liked you--but\nyou were so confoundedly interfering. I couldn't have all my plans\nbrought to naught by a chit of a girl.\"\n\n\"I think your plan at the Falls was really the cleverest,\" I said,\nendeavouring to look at the thing in a detached fashion. \"I would\nhave been ready to swear anywhere that you were in the hotel when\nI went out. Seeing is believing in future.\"\n\n\"Yes, Minks had one of his greatest successes as Miss Pettigrew,\nand he can imitate my voice quite creditably.\"\n\n\"There is one thing I should like to know.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"How did you induce Pagett to engage her?\"\n\n\"Oh, that was quite simple. She met Pagett in the doorway of the\nTrade Commissioner's office or the Chamber of Mines, or wherever\nit was he went--told him I had phoned down in a hurry, and that she\nhad been selected by the Government department in question. Pagett\nswallowed it like a lamb.\"\n\n\"You're very frank,\" I said, studying him.\n\n\"There's no earthly reason why I shouldn't be.\"\n\nI didn't quite like the sound of that.", "I hastened to put my own\ninterpretation on it.\n\n\"You believe in the success of this Revolution? You've burnt your\nboats.\"\n\n\"For an otherwise intelligent young woman, that's a singularly\nunintelligent remark. No, my dear child, I do not believe in this\nRevolution. I give it a couple of days longer and it will fizzle\nout ignominiously.\"\n\n\"Not one of your successes, in fact?\" I said nastily.\n\n\"Like all women, you've no idea of business. The job I took on was\nto supply certain explosives and arms--heavily paid for--to foment\nfeeling generally, and to incriminate certain people up to the\nhilt. I've carried out my contract with complete success, and I\nwas careful to be paid in advance. I took special care over the\nwhole thing, as I intended it to be my last contract before retiring\nfrom business. As for burning my boats, as you call it, I simply\ndon't know what you mean. I'm not the rebel chief, or anything of\nthat kind--I'm a distinguished English visitor, who had the\nmisfortune to go nosing into a certain curio-shop--and saw a little\nmore than he was meant to, and so the poor fellow was kidnapped.\nTo-morrow, or the day after, when circumstances permit, I shall be\nfound tied up somewhere in a pitiable state of terror and\nstarvation.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" I said slowly. \"But what about me?\"\n\n\"That's just it,\" said Sir Eustace softly. \"What about you? I've\ngot you here--I don't want to rub it in in any way--but I've got you\nhere very neatly. The question is, what am I going to do with you?\nThe simplest way of disposing of you--and, I may add, the pleasantest\nto myself--is the way of marriage. Wives can't accuse their husbands,\nyou know, and I'd rather like a pretty young wife to hold my hand\nand glance at me out of liquid eyes--don't flash them at me so! You\nquite frighten me. I see that the plan does not commend itself to\nyou?\"\n\n\"It does not.\"\n\nSir Eustace sighed.\n\n\"A pity!", "But I am no Adelphi villain. The usual trouble, I suppose.\nYou love another, as the books say.\"\n\n\"I love another.\"\n\n\"I thought as much--first I thought it was that long-legged, pompous\nass, Race, but I suppose it's the young hero who fished you out of\nthe Falls that night. Women have no taste. Neither of those two\nhave half the brains that I have. I'm such an easy person to\nunderestimate.\"\n\nI think he was right about that. Although I knew well enough the\nkind of man he was and must be, I could not bring myself to realize\nit. He had tried to kill me on more than one occasion, he had\nactually killed another woman, and he was responsible for endless\nother deeds of which I knew nothing, and yet I was quite unable to\nbring myself into the frame of mind for appreciating his deeds as\nthey deserved. I could not think of him as other than our amusing,\ngenial travelling companion. I could not even feel frightened of\nhim--and yet I knew he was capable of having me murdered in cold\nblood if it struck him as necessary. The only parallel I can think\nof is the case of Stevenson's Long John Silver. He must have been\nmuch the same kind of man.\n\n\"Well, well,\" said this extraordinary person, leaning back in his\nchair. \"It's a pity that the idea of being Lady Pedler doesn't\nappeal to you. The other alternatives are rather crude.\"\n\nI felt a nasty feeling going up and down my spine. Of course I had\nknown all along that I was taking a big risk, but the prize had\nseemed worth it. Would things turn out as I had calculated, or\nwould they not?\n\n\"The fact of the matter is,\" Sir Eustace was continuing, \"I've a\nweakness for you. I really don't want to proceed to extremes.\nSuppose you tell me the whole story, from the very beginning, and\nlet's see what we can make of it. But no romancing, mind--I want\nthe truth.\"\n\nI was not going to make any mistake over that.", "I had a great deal\nof respect for Sir Eustace's shrewdness. It was a moment for the\ntruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I told him the\nwhole story, omitting nothing, up to the moment of my rescue by\nHarry. When I had finished, he nodded his head in approval.\n\n\"Wise girl. You've made a clean breast of the thing. And let me\ntell you I should soon have caught you out if you hadn't. A lot of\npeople wouldn't believe your story, anyway, especially the beginning\npart, but I do. You're the kind of girl who would start off like\nthat--at a moment's notice, on the slenderest of motives. You've\nhad amazing luck, of course, but sooner or later the amateur runs\nup against the professional and then the result is a foregone\nconclusion. I am the professional. I started on this business when\nI was quite a youngster. All things considered, it seemed to me a\ngood way of getting rich quickly. I always could think things out,\nand devise ingenious schemes--and I never made the mistake of trying\nto carry out my schemes myself. Always employ the expert--that has\nbeen my motto. The one time I departed from it I came to grief--but\nI couldn't trust any one to do that job for me. Nadina knew too\nmuch. I'm an easy-going man, kind-hearted and good tempered so long\nas I'm not thwarted. Nadina both thwarted me and threatened me--just\nas I was at the apex of a successful career. Once she was dead and\nthe diamonds were in my possession, I was safe. I've come to the\nconclusion now that I bungled the job. That idiot Pagett, with his\nwife and family! My fault--it tickled my sense of humour to employ\nthe fellow, with his Cinquecento poisoner's face and his\nmid-Victorian soul. A maxim for you, my dear Anne. Don't let your\nsense of humour carry you away. For years I've had an instinct that\nit would be wise to get rid of Pagett, but the fellow was so\nhard-working and conscientious that I honestly couldn't find an\nexcuse for sacking him.", "So I left things drift.\n\n\"But we're wandering from the point. The question is what to do\nwith you. Your narrative was admirably clear, but there is one\nthing that still escapes me. Where are the diamonds now?\"\n\n\"Harry Rayburn has them,\" I said, watching him.\n\nHis face did not change, it retained its expression of sardonic\ngood-humour.\n\n\"H'm. I want those diamonds.\"\n\n\"I don't see much chance of your getting them,\" I replied.\n\n\"Don't you? Now I do. I don't want to be unpleasant, but I should\nlike you to reflect that a dead girl or so found in this quarter\nof the city will occasion no surprise. There's a man downstairs\nwho does those sort of jobs very neatly. Now, you're a sensible\nyoung woman. What I propose is this: you will sit down and write\nto Harry Rayburn, telling him to join you here and bring the\ndiamonds with him----\"\n\n\"I won't do anything of the kind.\"\n\n\"Don't interrupt your elders. I propose to make a bargain with you.\nThe diamonds in exchange for your life. And don't make any mistake\nabout it, your life is absolutely in my power.\"\n\n\"And Harry?\"\n\n\"I'm far too tender-hearted to part two young lovers. He shall go\nfree too--on the understanding, of course, that neither of you will\ninterfere with me in future.\"\n\n\"And what guarantee have I that you will keep your side of the\nbargain?\"\n\n\"None whatever, my dear girl. You'll have to trust me and hope for\nthe best. Of course, if you're in an heroic mood and prefer\nannihilation, that's another matter.\"\n\nThis was what I had been playing for. I was careful not to jump at\nthe bait. Gradually I allowed myself to be bullied and cajoled into\nyielding. I wrote at Sir Eustace's dictation:\n\nDear Harry,\n\nI think I see a chance of establishing your innocence beyond any\npossible doubt. Please follow my instructions minutely. Go to\nAgrasato's curio-shop. Ask to see something \"out of the ordinary,\"\n\"for a special occasion.\" The man will then ask you to \"come into\nthe back room.\"", "Go with him. You will find a messenger who will\nbring you to me. Do exactly as he tells you. Be sure and bring the\ndiamonds with you. Not a word to any one.\n\nSir Eustace stopped. \"I leave the fancy touches to your own\nimagination,\" he remarked. \"But be careful to make no mistakes.\"\n\n\"'Yours for ever and ever, Anne,' will be sufficient,\" I remarked.\n\nI wrote in the words. Sir Eustace stretched out his hand for the\nletter and read it through.\n\n\"That seems all right. Now the address.\"\n\nI gave it him. It was that of a small shop which received letters\nand telegrams for a consideration.\n\nHe struck the bell upon the table with his hand. Chichester-Pettigrew,\n_alias_ Minks, answered the summons.\n\n\"This letter is to go immediately--the usual route.\"\n\n\"Very well, Colonel.\"\n\nHe looked at the name on the envelope. Sir Eustace was watching\nhim keenly.\n\n\"A friend of yours, I think?\"\n\n\"Of mine?\"\n\nThe man seemed startled.\n\n\"You had a prolonged conversation with him in Johannesburg\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"A man came up and questioned me about your movements and those of\nColonel Race. I gave him misleading information.\"\n\n\"Excellent, my dear fellow, excellent,\" said Sir Eustace genially.\n\"My mistake.\"\n\nI chanced to look at Chichester-Pettigrew as he left the room. He\nwas white to the lips, as though in deadly terror. No sooner was\nhe outside than Sir Eustace picked up a speaking-tube that rested\nby his elbow and spoke down it.\n\n\"That you, Schwart? Watch Minks. He's not to leave the house\nwithout orders.\"\n\nHe put the speaking-tube down again and frowned, slightly tapping\nthe table with his hand.\n\n\"May I ask you a few questions, Sir Eustace,\" I said, after a\nminute or two of silence.\n\n\"Certainly. What excellent nerves you have, Anne. You are capable\nof taking an intelligent interest in things when most girls would\nbe sniffling and wringing their hands.\"\n\n\"Why did you take Harry as your secretary instead of giving him up\nto the police?\"\n\n\"I wanted those cursed diamonds. Nadina, the little devil, was\nplaying off your Harry against me.", "Unless I gave her the price she\nwanted, she threatened to sell them back to him. That was another\nmistake I made--I thought she'd have them with her that day. But\nshe was too clever for that. Carton, her husband, was dead too--I'd\nno clue whatsoever as to where the diamonds were hidden. Then I\nmanaged to get a copy of a wireless message sent to Nadina by some\none on board the _Kilmorden_--either Carton or Rayburn, I didn't\nknow which. It was a duplicate of that piece of paper you picked\nup. 'Seventeen one twenty two,' it ran. I took it to be an\nappointment with Rayburn, and when he was so desperate to get\naboard the _Kilmorden_ I was convinced that I was right. So I\npretended to swallow his statements, and let him come. I kept a\npretty sharp watch upon him and hoped that I should learn more.\nThen I found Minks trying to play a lone hand and interfering with\nme. I soon stopped that. He came to heel all right. It was annoying\nnot getting Cabin 17, and it worried me not being able to place\nyou. Were you the innocent young girl you seemed, or were you not?\nWhen Rayburn set out to keep the appointment that night, Minks was\ntold off to intercept him. Minks muffed it of course.\"\n\n\"But why did the wireless message say 'seventeen' instead of\n'seventy-one'?\"\n\n\"I've thought that out. Carton must have given that wireless\noperator his own memorandum to copy off on to a form, and he never\nread the copy through. The operator made the same mistake we all\ndid, and read it as 17.1.22 instead of 1.71.22. The thing I don't\nknow is how Minks got on to Cabin 17. It must have been sheer\ninstinct.\"\n\n\"And the dispatch to General Smuts? Who tampered with that?\"\n\n\"My dear Anne, you don't suppose I was going to have a lot of my\nplans given away, without making an effort to save them? With an\nescaped murderer as a secretary, I had no hesitation whatever in\nsubstituting blanks.", "Nobody would think of suspecting poor old\nPedler.\"\n\n\"What about Colonel Race?\"\n\n\"Yes, that was a nasty jar. When Pagett told me he was a Secret\nService fellow, I had an unpleasant feeling down the spine. I\nremembered that he'd been nosing around Nadina in Paris during the\nWar--and I had a horrible suspicion that he was out after _me!_ I\ndon't like the way he's stuck to me ever since. He's one of those\nstrong, silent men who have always got something up their sleeve.\"\n\nA whistle sounded. Sir Eustace picked up the tube, listened for a\nminute or two, then answered:\n\n\"Very well, I'll see him now.\"\n\n\"Business,\" he remarked. \"Miss Anne, let me show you your room.\"\n\nHe ushered me into a small shabby apartment, a Kafir boy brought\nup my small suit-case, and Sir Eustace, urging me to ask for\nanything I wanted, withdrew, the picture of a courteous host. A\ncan of hot water was on the washstand, and I proceeded to unpack\na few necessaries. Something hard and unfamiliar in my sponge-bag\npuzzled me greatly. I untied the string and looked inside.\n\nTo my utter amazement I drew out a small pearl-handled revolver.\nIt hadn't been there when I started from Kimberley. I examined the\nthing gingerly. It appeared to be loaded.\n\nI handled it with a comfortable feeling. It was a useful thing to\nhave in a house such as this. But modern clothes are quite unsuited\nto the carrying of fire-arms. In the end I pushed it gingerly into\nthe top of my stocking. It made a terrible bulge, and I expected\nevery minute that it would go off and shoot me in the leg, but it\nreally seemed the only place.\n\nI was not summoned to Sir Eustace's presence until late in the\nafternoon. Eleven-o'clock tea and a substantial lunch had been\nserved to me in my own apartment, and I felt fortified for further\nconflict.\n\nSir Eustace was alone. He was walking up and down the room, and\nthere was a gleam in his eye and a restlessness in his manner which\ndid not escape me.", "He was exultant about something. There was a\nsubtle change in his manner towards me.\n\n\"I have news for you. Your young man is on his way. He will be here\nin a few minutes. Moderate your transports--I have something more\nto say. You attempted to deceive me this morning. I warned you that\nyou would be wise to stick to the truth, and up to a certain point\nyou obeyed me. Then you ran off the rails. You attempted to make\nme believe that the diamonds were in Harry Rayburn's possession.\nAt the time, I accepted your statement because it facilitated my\ntask--the task of inducing you to decoy Harry Rayburn here. But, my\ndear Anne, the diamonds have been in my possession ever since I\nleft the Falls--though I only discovered the fact yesterday.\"\n\n\"You know!\" I gasped.\n\n\"It may interest you to hear that it was Pagett who gave the show\naway. He insisted on boring me with a long pointless story about\na wager and a tin of films. It didn't take me long to put two and\ntwo together--Mrs. Blair's distrust of Colonel Race, her agitation,\nher entreaty that I would take care of her souvenirs for her. The\nexcellent Pagett had already unfastened the cases through an excess\nof zeal. Before leaving the hotel, I simply transferred all the\nrolls of films to my own pocket. They are in the corner there. I\nadmit that I haven't had time to examine them yet, but I notice\nthat one is of a totally different weight to the others, rattles\nin a peculiar fashion, and has evidently been stuck down with\nseccotine, which will necessitate the use of a tin-opener. The case\nseems clear, does it not? And now, you see, I have you both nicely\nin the trap. . . . It's a pity that you didn't take kindly to the\nidea of becoming Lady Pedler.\"\n\nI did not answer. I stood looking at him.\n\nThere was the sound of feet on the stairs, the door was flung open,\nand Harry Rayburn was hustled into the room between two men.", "Sir\nEustace flung me a look of triumph.\n\n\"According to plan,\" he said softly. \"You amateurs _will_ pit\nyourselves against professionals.\"\n\n\"What's the meaning of this?\" cried Harry hoarsely.\n\n\"It means that you have walked into my parlour--said the spider to\nthe fly,\" remarked Sir Eustace facetiously. \"My dear Rayburn, you\nare extraordinarily unlucky.\"\n\n\"You said I could come safely, Anne?\"\n\n\"Do not reproach her, my dear fellow. That note was written at my\ndictation, and the lady could not help herself. She would have been\nwiser not to write it, but I did not tell her so at the time. You\nfollowed her instructions, went to the curio-shop, were taken\nthrough the secret passage from the back room--and found yourself\nin the hands of your enemies!\"\n\nHarry looked at me. I understood his glance and edged nearer to\nSir Eustace.\n\n\"Yes,\" murmured the latter, \"decidedly you are not lucky! This\nis--let me see, the third encounter.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said Harry. \"This is the third encounter. Twice\nyou have worsted me--have you never heard that the third time the\nluck changes? This is my round--cover him, Anne.\"\n\nI was all ready. In a flash I had whipped the pistol out of my\nstocking and was holding it to his head. The two men guarding Harry\nsprang forward, but his voice stopped them.\n\n\"Another step--and he dies! If they come any nearer, Anne, pull the\ntrigger--don't hesitate.\"\n\n\"I shan't,\" I replied cheerfully. \"I'm rather afraid of pulling\nit, anyway.\"\n\nI think Sir Eustace shared my fears. He was certainly shaking like\na jelly.\n\n\"Stay where you are,\" he commanded, and the men stopped obediently.\n\n\"Tell them to leave the room,\" said Harry.\n\nSir Eustace gave the order. The men filed out, and Harry shot the\nbolt across the door behind them.\n\n\"Now we can talk,\" he observed grimly, and coming across the room,\nhe took the revolver out of my hand.\n\nSir Eustace uttered a sigh of relief and wiped his forehead with\na handkerchief.\n\n\"I'm shockingly out of condition,\" he observed.", "\"I think I must\nhave a weak heart. I am glad that revolver is in competent hands.\nI didn't trust Miss Anne with it. Well, my young friend, as you\nsay, now we can talk. I'm willing to admit that you stole a march\nupon me. Where the devil that revolver came from I don't know. I\nhad the girl's luggage searched when she arrived. And where did\nyou produce it from now? You hadn't got it on you a minute ago?\"\n\n\"Yes, I had,\" I replied. \"It was in my stocking.\"\n\n\"I don't know enough about women. I ought to have studied them\nmore,\" said Sir Eustace sadly. \"I wonder if Pagett would have known\nthat?\"\n\nHarry rapped sharply on the table.\n\n\"Don't play the fool. If it weren't for your grey hairs, I'd throw\nyou out of the window. You damned scoundrel! Grey hairs, or no grey\nhairs, I----\"\n\nHe advanced a step or two, and Sir Eustace skipped nimbly behind\nthe table.\n\n\"The young are always so violent,\" he said reproachfully. \"Unable\nto use their brains, they rely solely on their muscles. Let us talk\nsense. For the moment you have the upper hand. But that state of\naffairs cannot continue. The house is full of my men. You are\nhopelessly outnumbered. Your momentary ascendency has been gained\nby an accident----\"\n\n\"Has it?\"\n\nSomething in Harry's voice, a grim raillery, seemed to attract Sir\nEustace's attention. He stared at him.\n\n\"Has it?\" said Harry again. \"Sit down, Sir Eustace, and listen to\nwhat I have to say.\" Still covering him with the revolver, he went\non: \"The cards are against you this time. To begin with, listen to\n_that!\"_\n\n_That_ was a dull banging at the door below. There were shouts,\noaths, and then a sound of firing. Sir Eustace paled.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Race--and his people. You didn't know, did you, Sir Eustace, that\nAnne had an arrangement with me by which we should know whether\ncommunications from one to the other were genuine? Telegrams were\nto be signed 'Andy,' letters were to have the word 'and' crossed\nout somewhere in them.", "Anne knew that your telegram was a fake.\nShe came here of her own free will, walked deliberately into the\nsnare, in the hope that she might catch you in your own trap.\nBefore leaving Kimberley she wired both to me and to Race. Mrs.\nBlair has been in communication with us ever since. I received the\nletter written at your dictation, which was just what I expected.\nI had already discussed the probabilities of a secret passage\nleading out of the curio-shop with Race, and he had discovered the\nplace where the exit was situated.\"\n\nThere was a screaming, tearing sound, and a heavy explosion which\nshook the room.\n\n\"They're shelling this part of the town. I must get you out of\nhere, Anne.\"\n\nA bright light flared up. The house opposite was on fire. Sir\nEustace had risen and was passing up and down. Harry kept him\ncovered with the revolver.\n\n\"So you see, Sir Eustace, the game is up. It was you yourself who\nvery kindly provided us with the clue of your whereabouts. Race's\nmen were watching the exit of the secret passage. In spite of the\nprecautions you took, they were successful in following me here.\"\n\nSir Eustace turned suddenly.\n\n\"Very clever. Very creditable. But I've still a word to say. If\nI've lost the trick, so have you. You'll never be able to bring\nthe murder of Nadina home to me. I was in Marlow on that day,\nthat's all you've got against me. No one can prove that I even knew\nthe woman. But you knew her, you had a motive for killing her--and\nyour record's against you. You're a thief, remember, a thief.\nThere's one thing you don't know, perhaps. _I've got the diamonds._\nAnd here goes----\"\n\nWith an incredibly swift movement, he stooped, swung up his arm\nand threw. There was a tinkle of breaking glass, as the object went\nthrough the window and disappeared into the blazing mass opposite.\n\n\"There goes your only hope of establishing your innocence over the\nKimberley affair. And now we'll talk. I'll drive a bargain with\nyou.", "You've got me cornered. Race will find all he needs in this\nhouse. There's a chance for me if I can get away. I'm done for if\nI stay, but so are you, young man! There's a skylight in the next\nroom. A couple of minutes' start and I shall be all right. I've\ngot one or two little arrangements all ready made. You let me out\nthat way, and give me a start--and I leave you a signed confession\nthat I killed Nadina.\"\n\n_\"Yes,_ Harry,\" I cried. \"Yes, yes, yes!\"\n\nHe turned a stern face on me.\n\n\"No, Anne, a thousand times, no. You don't know what you're saying.\"\n\n\"I do. It solves everything.\"\n\n\"I'd never be able to look Race in the face again. I'll take my\nchance, but I'm damned if I'll let this slippery old fox get away.\nIt's no good, Anne. I won't do it.\"\n\nSir Eustace chuckled. He accepted defeat without the least emotion.\n\n\"Well, well,\" he remarked. \"You seem to have met your master, Anne.\nBut I can assure you both that moral rectitude does not always\npay.\"\n\nThere was a crash of rending wood, and footsteps surged up the\nstairs. Harry drew back the bolt. Colonel Race was the first to\nenter the room. His face lit at the sight of us.\n\n\"You're safe, Anne. I was afraid----\" He turned to Sir Eustace. \"I've\nbeen after you for a long time, Pedler--and at last I've got you.\"\n\n\"Everybody seems to have gone completely mad,\" declared Sir Eustace\nairily. \"These young people have been threatening me with revolvers\nand accusing me of the most shocking things. I don't know what it's\nall about.\"\n\n\"Don't you? It means that I've found the 'Colonel.' It means that\non January 8th last you were not at Cannes, but at Marlow. It means\nthat when your tool, Madame Nadina, turned against you, you planned\nto do away with her--and at last we shall be able to bring the crime\nhome to you.\"\n\n\"Indeed? And from whom did you get all this interesting information?\nFrom the man who is even now being looked for by the police?", "His\nevidence will be very valuable.\"\n\n\"We have other evidence. There is some one else who knew that\nNadina was going to meet you at the Mill House.\"\n\nSir Eustace looked surprised. Colonel Race made a gesture with his\nhand. Arthur Minks _alias_ the Rev. Edward Chichester _alias_ Miss\nPettigrew stepped forward. He was pale and nervous, but he spoke\nclearly enough:\n\n\"I saw Nadina in Paris the night before she went over to England.\nI was posing at the time as a Russian Count. She told me of her\npurpose. I warned her, knowing what kind of man she had to deal\nwith, but she did not take my advice. There was a wireless message\non the table. I read it. Afterwards I thought I would have a try\nfor the diamonds myself. In Johannesburg, Mr. Rayburn accosted me.\nHe persuaded me to come over to his side.\"\n\nSir Eustace looked at him. He said nothing, but Minks seemed\nvisibly to wilt.\n\n\"Rats always leaving a sinking ship,\" observed Sir Eustace. \"I\ndon't care for rats. Sooner or later, I destroy vermin.\"\n\n\"There's just one thing I'd like to tell you, Sir Eustace,\" I\nremarked. \"That tin you threw out of the window didn't contain the\ndiamonds. It had common pebbles in it. The diamonds are in a\nperfectly safe place. As a matter of fact, they're in the big\ngiraffe's stomach. Suzanne hollowed it out, put the diamonds in\nwith cotton wool, so that they wouldn't rattle, and plugged it up\nagain.\"\n\nSir Eustace looked at me for some time. His reply was characteristic:\n\n\"I always did hate that blinking giraffe,\" he said. \"It must have\nbeen instinct.\"\n\nWe were not able to return to Johannesburg that night. The shells\nwere coming over pretty fast, and I gathered that we were now more\nor less cut off, owing to the rebels having obtained possession of\na new part of the suburbs.\n\nOur place of refuge was a farm some twenty miles or so from\nJohannesburg--right out on the veld. I was dropping with fatigue.\nAll the excitement and anxiety of the last two days had left me\nlittle better than a limp rag.", "I kept repeating to myself, without being able to believe it, that\nour troubles were really over. Harry and I were together and we\nshould never be separated again. Yet all through I was conscious\nof some barrier between us--a constraint on his part, the reason of\nwhich I could not fathom.\n\nSir Eustace had been driven off in an opposite direction accompanied\nby a strong guard. He waved his hand airily to us on departing.\n\nI came out on to the _stoep_ early on the following morning and\nlooked across the veld in the direction of Johannesburg. I could\nsee the great dumps glistening in the pale morning sunshine, and\nI could hear the low rumbling mutter of the guns. The Revolution\nwas not over yet.\n\nThe farmer's wife came out and called me in to breakfast. She was\na kind, motherly soul, and I was already very fond of her. Harry\nhad gone out at dawn and had not yet returned, so she informed me.\nAgain I felt a stir of uneasiness pass over me. What was this\nshadow of which I was so conscious between us?\n\nAfter breakfast I sat out on the _stoep_, a book in my hand which\nI did not read. I was so lost in my own thoughts that I never saw\nColonel Race ride up and dismount from his horse. It was not until\nhe said \"Good morning, Anne,\" that I became aware of his presence.\n\n\"Oh,\" I said, with a flush, \"it's you.\"\n\n\"Yes. May I sit down?\"\n\nHe drew a chair up beside me. It was the first time we had been\nalone together since that day at the Matoppos. As always, I felt\nthat curious mixture of fascination and fear that he never failed\nto inspire in me.\n\n\"What is the news?\" I asked.\n\n\"Smuts will be in Johannesburg to-morrow. I give this outbreak\nthree days more before it collapses utterly. In the meantime the\nfighting goes on.\"\n\n\"I wish,\" I said, \"that one could be sure that the right people\nwere the ones to get killed.", "I mean the ones who wanted to fight--not\njust all the poor people who happen to live in the parts where the\nfighting is going on.\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"I know what you mean, Anne. That's the unfairness of war. But I've\nother news for you.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"A confession of incompetency on my part. Pedler has managed to\nescape.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Yes. No one knows how he managed it. He was securely locked up\nfor the night--in an upper-story room of one of the farms roundabouts\nwhich the Military have taken over, but this morning the room was\nempty and the bird had flown.\"\n\nSecretly I was rather pleased. Never, to this day, have I been able\nto rid myself of a sneaking fondness for Sir Eustace. I dare say\nit's reprehensible, but there it is. I admired him. He was a\nthorough-going villain, I dare say--but he was a pleasant one. I've\nnever met any one half so amusing since.\n\nI concealed my feelings, of course. Naturally Colonel Race would\nfeel quite differently about it. He wanted Sir Eustace brought to\njustice. There was nothing very surprising in his escape when one\ncame to think of it. All round Jo'burg he must have innumerable\nspies and agents. And, whatever Colonel Race might think, I was\nexceedingly doubtful that they would ever catch him. He probably\nhad a well-planned line of retreat. Indeed, he had said as much to\nus.\n\nI expressed myself suitably, though in a rather lukewarm manner,\nand the conversation languished. Then Colonel Race asked suddenly\nfor Harry. I told him that he had gone off at dawn and that I\nhadn't seen him this morning.\n\n\"You understand, don't you, Anne, that apart from formalities, he\nis completely cleared? There are technicalities, of course, but\nSir Eustace's guilt is well assured. There is nothing now to keep\nyou apart.\"\n\nHe said this without looking at me, in a slow, jerky voice.\n\n\"I understand,\" I said gratefully.\n\n\"And there is no reason why he should not at once resume his real\nname.\"\n\n\"No, of course not.\"", "\"You know his real name?\"\n\nThe question surprised me.\n\n\"Of course I do. Harry Lucas.\"\n\nHe did not answer, and something in the quality of his silence\nstruck me as peculiar.\n\n\"Anne, do you remember that, as we drove home from the Matoppos\nthat day, I told you that I knew what I had to do?\"\n\n\"Of course I remember.\"\n\n\"I think that I may fairly say I have done it. The man you love is\ncleared of suspicion.\"\n\n\"Was that what you meant?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nI hung my head, ashamed of the baseless suspicion I had entertained.\nHe spoke again in a thoughtful voice:\n\n\"When I was a mere youngster, I was in love with a girl who jilted\nme. After that I thought only of my work. My career meant everything\nto me. Then I met you, Anne--and all that seemed worth nothing. But\nyouth's call to youth. . . . I've still got my work.\"\n\nI was silent. I suppose one can't really love two men at once--but\nyou can feel like it. The magnetism of this man was very great. I\nlooked up at him suddenly.\n\n\"I think that you'll go very far,\" I said dreamily. \"I think that\nyou've got a great career ahead of you. You'll be one of the\nworld's big men.\"\n\nI felt as though I was uttering a prophecy.\n\n\"I shall be alone, though.\"\n\n\"All the people who do really big things are.\"\n\n\"You think so?\"\n\n\"I'm sure of it.\"\n\nHe took my hand and said in a low voice:\n\n\"I'd rather have had--the other.\"\n\nThen Harry came striding round the corner of the house. Colonel\nRace rose.\n\n\"Good morning--Lucas,\" he said.\n\nFor some reason Harry flushed up to the roots of his hair.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said gaily, \"you must be known by your real name now.\"\n\nBut Harry was still staring at Colonel Race.\n\n\"So you know, sir,\" he said at last.\n\n\"I never forget a face. I saw you once as a boy.\"\n\n\"What's all this about?\" I asked, puzzled, looking from one to the\nother.\n\nIt seemed a conflict of wills between them.", "Race won. Harry turned\nslightly away.\n\n\"I suppose you're right, sir. Tell her my real name.\"\n\n\"Anne, this isn't Harry Lucas. Harry Lucas was killed in the War.\nThis is John Harold Eardsley.\"\n\nWith his last words Colonel Race had swung away and left us. I\nstood staring after him. Harry's voice recalled me to myself.\n\n\"Anne, forgive me, say you forgive me.\"\n\nHe took my hand in his and almost mechanically I drew it away.\n\n\"Why did you deceive me?\"\n\n\"I don't know that I can make you understand. I was afraid of all\nthat sort of thing--the power and fascination of wealth. I wanted\nyou to care for me just for myself--for the man I was--without\nornaments and trappings.\"\n\n\"You mean you didn't trust me?\"\n\n\"You can put it that way if you like, but it isn't quite true. I'd\nbecome embittered, suspicious--always prone to look for ulterior\nmotives--and it was so wonderful to be cared for in the way you\ncared for me.\"\n\n\"I see,\" I said slowly. I was going over in my own mind the story\nhe had told me. For the first time I noted discrepancies in it\nwhich I had disregarded--an assurance of money, the power to buy\nback the diamonds of Nadina, the way in which he had preferred to\nspeak of both men from the point of view of an outsider. And when\nhe had said \"my friend\" he had meant, not Eardsley, but Lucas. It\nwas Lucas, the quiet fellow, who had loved Nadina so deeply.\n\n\"How did it come about?\" I asked.\n\n\"We were both reckless--anxious to get killed. One night we exchanged\nidentification discs--for luck! Lucas was killed the next day--blown\nto pieces.\"\n\nI shuddered.\n\n\"But why didn't you tell me now? This morning? You couldn't have\ndoubted my caring for you by this time?\"\n\n\"Anne, I didn't want to spoil it all. I wanted to take you back to\nthe island. What's the good of money? It can't buy happiness. We'd\nhave been happy on the island. I tell you I'm afraid of that other\nlife--it nearly rotted me through once.\"", "\"Did Sir Eustace know who you really were?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"And Carton?\"\n\n\"No. He saw us both with Nadina at Kimberley one night, but he\ndidn't know which was which. He accepted my statement that I was\nLucas, and Nadina was deceived by his cable. She was never afraid\nof Lucas. He was a quiet chap--very deep. But I always had the\ndevil's own temper. She'd have been scared out of her life if she'd\nknown that I'd come to life again.\"\n\n\"Harry, if Colonel Race hadn't told me, what did you mean to do?\"\n\n\"Say nothing. Go on as Lucas.\"\n\n\"And your father's millions?\"\n\n\"Race was welcome to them. Anyway, he would make a better use of\nthem than I ever shall. Anne, what are you thinking about? You're\nfrowning so.\"\n\n\"I'm thinking,\" I said slowly, \"that I almost wish Colonel Race\nhadn't made you tell me.\"\n\n\"No. He was right. I owed you the truth.\"\n\nHe paused, then said suddenly:\n\n\"You know, Anne, I'm jealous of Race. He loves you too--and he's a\nbigger man than I am or ever shall be.\"\n\nI turned to him, laughing.\n\n\"Harry, you idiot. It's you I want--and that's all that matters.\"\n\nAs soon as possible we started for Cape Town. There Suzanne was\nwaiting to greet me, and we disembowelled the big giraffe together.\nWhen the Revolution was finally quelled, Colonel Race came down to\nCape Town and at his suggestion the big villa at Muizenberg that\nhad belonged to Sir Lawrence Eardsley was reopened and we all took\nup our abode in it.\n\nThere we made our plans. I was to return to England with Suzanne\nand to be married from her house in London. And the trousseau was\nto be bought in Paris! Suzanne enjoyed planning all these details\nenormously. So did I. And yet the future seemed curiously unreal.\nAnd sometimes, without knowing why, I felt absolutely stifled--as\nthough I couldn't breathe.\n\nIt was the night before we were to sail. I couldn't sleep. I was\nmiserable, and I didn't know why. I hated leaving Africa.", "When I\ncame back to it, would it be the same thing? Would it ever be the\nsame thing again?\n\nAnd then I was startled by an authoritative rap on the shutter. I\nsprang up. Harry was on the _stoep_ outside.\n\n\"Put some clothes on, Anne, and come out. I want to speak to you.\"\n\nI huddled on a few garments, and stepped out into the cool night\nair--still and scented, with its velvety feel. Harry beckoned me\nout of earshot of the house. His face looked pale and determined\nand his eyes were blazing.\n\n\"Anne, do you remember saying to me once that women enjoyed doing\nthe things they disliked for the sake of some one they liked?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, wondering what was coming.\n\nHe caught me in his arms.\n\n\"Anne, come away with me--now--to-night. Back to Rhodesia--back to\nthe island. I can't stand all this tomfoolery. I can't wait for\nyou any longer.\"\n\nI disengaged myself a minute.\n\n\"And what about my French frocks?\" I lamented mockingly.\n\nTo this day Harry never knows when I'm in earnest and when I'm only\nteasing him.\n\n\"Damn your French frocks. Do you think I want to put frocks on you?\nI'm a damned sight more likely to want to tear them off you. I'm\nnot going to let you go, do you hear? You're my woman. If I let\nyou go away, I may lose you. I'm never sure of you. You're coming\nwith me now--to-night--and damn everybody.\"\n\nHe held me to him, kissing me until I could hardly breathe.\n\n\"I can't do without you any longer, Anne. I can't indeed. I hate\nall this money. Let Race have it. Come on. Let's go.\"\n\n\"My toothbrush?\" I demurred.\n\n\"You can buy one. I know I'm a lunatic, but for God's sake, _come!\"_\n\nHe stalked off at a furious pace. I followed him as meekly as the\nBarotsi woman I had observed at the Falls. Only I wasn't carrying\na frying-pan on my head. He walked so fast that it was very\ndifficult to keep up with him.", "\"Harry,\" I said at last, in a meek voice, \"are we going to walk\nall the way to Rhodesia?\"\n\nHe turned suddenly and with a great shout of laughter gathered me\nup in his arms.\n\n\"I'm mad, sweetheart, I know it. But I do love you so.\"\n\n\"We're a couple of lunatics. And, oh, Harry, you never asked me,\nbut I'm not making a sacrifice at all! I _wanted_ to come!\"\n\nThat was two years ago. We still live on the island. Before me, on\nthe rough wooden table, is the letter that Suzanne wrote me.\n\nDear Babes in the Wood--Dear Lunatics in Love,\n\nI'm not surprised--not at all. All the time we've been talking Paris\nand frocks I felt that it wasn't a bit real--that you'd vanish into\nthe blue some day to be married over the tongs in the good old\ngipsy fashion. But you _are_ a couple of lunatics! This idea of\nrenouncing a vast fortune is absurd. Colonel Race wanted to argue\nthe matter, but I have persuaded him to leave the argument to time.\nHe can administer the estate for Harry--and none better. Because,\nafter all, honeymoons don't last forever--you're not here, Anne, so\nI can safely say that without having you fly out at me like a\nlittle wild-cat--Love in the wilderness will last a good while, but\none day you will suddenly begin to dream of houses in Park Lane,\nsumptuous furs, Paris frocks, the largest thing in motors and the\nlatest thing in perambulators, French maids and Norland nurses!\nOh, yes, you will!\n\nBut have your honeymoon, dear lunatics, and let it be a long one.\nAnd think of me sometimes, comfortably putting on weight amidst\nthe fleshpots!\n\nYour loving friend, Suzanne Blair.\n\nP.S.--I am sending you an assortment of frying-pans as a wedding\npresent, and an enormous _terrine_ of _pate de foie gras_ to remind\nyou of me.\n\nThere is another letter that I sometimes read. It came a good while\nafter the other and was accompanied by a bulky packet.", "It appeared\nto be written from somewhere in Bolivia.\n\nMy dear Anne Beddingfeld,\n\nI can't resist writing to you, not so much for the pleasure it\ngives me to write, as for the enormous pleasure I know it will give\nyou to hear from me. Our friend Race wasn't quite as clever as he\nthought himself, was he?\n\nI think I shall appoint you my literary executor. I'm sending you\nmy diary. There's nothing in it that would interest Race and his\ncrowd, but I fancy that there are passages in it which may amuse\nyou. Make use of it in any way you like. I suggest an article for\nthe _Daily Budget,_ \"Criminals I have met.\" I only stipulate that\nI shall be the central figure.\n\nBy this time I have no doubt that you are no longer Anne Beddingfeld,\nbut Lady Eardsley, queening it in Park Lane. I should just like to\nsay that I bear you no malice whatever. It is hard, of course, to\nhave to begin all over again at my time of life, but, _entre nous,_\nI had a little reserve fund carefully put aside for such a\ncontingency. It has come in very usefully and I am getting together\na nice little connection. By the way, if you ever come across that\nfunny friend of yours, Arthur Minks, just tell him that I haven't\nforgotten him, will you? That will give him a nasty jar.\n\nOn the whole I think I have displayed a most Christian and forgiving\nspirit. Even to Pagett. I happened to hear that he--or rather Mrs.\nPagett--had brought a sixth child into the world the other day.\nEngland will be entirely populated by Pagetts soon. I sent the\nchild a silver mug, and, on a post card, declared my willingness\nto act as god-father. I can see Pagett taking both mug and post\ncard straight to Scotland Yard without a smile on his face!\n\nBless you, liquid eyes. Some day you will see what a mistake you\nhave made in not marrying me.\n\nYours ever,\n\nEustace Pedler.", "Harry was furious. It is the one point on which he and I do not\nsee eye to eye. To him, Sir Eustace was the man who tried to murder\nme and whom he regards as responsible for the death of his friend.\nSir Eustace's attempts on my life have always puzzled me. They are\nnot in the picture, so to speak. For I am sure that he always had\na genuinely kindly feeling towards me.\n\nThen why did he twice attempt to take my life? Harry says \"because\nhe's a damned scoundrel,\" and seems to think that settles the\nmatter. Suzanne was more discriminating. I talked it over with her,\nand she put it down to a \"fear complex.\" Suzanne goes in rather\nfor psycho-analysis. She pointed out to me that Sir Eustace's whole\nlife was actuated by a desire to be safe and comfortable. He had\nan acute sense of self-preservation. And the murder of Nadina\nremoved certain inhibitions. His actions did not represent the\nstate of his feeling towards me, but were the result of his acute\nfears for his own safety. I think Suzanne is right. As for Nadina,\nshe was the kind of woman who deserved to die. Men do all sorts of\nquestionable things in order to get rich, but women shouldn't\npretend to be in love when they aren't for ulterior motives.\n\nI can forgive Sir Eustace easily enough, but I shall never forgive\nNadina. Never, never, never!\n\nThe other day I was unpacking some tins that were wrapped in bits\nof an old _Daily Budget,_ and I suddenly came upon the words, \"The\nMan in the Brown Suit.\" How long ago it seemed! I had, of course,\nsevered my connection with the _Daily Budget_ long ago--I had done\nwith it sooner than it had done with me. _My Romantic Wedding_ was\ngiven a halo of publicity.\n\nMy son is lying in the sun, kicking his legs. There's a \"man in a\nbrown suit\" if you like. He's wearing as little as possible, which\nis the best costume for Africa, and is as brown as a berry.", "He's\nalways burrowing in the earth. I think he takes after Papa. He'll\nhave that same mania for Pleiocene clay.\n\nSuzanne sent me a cable when he was born:\n\n\"Congratulations and love to the latest arrival on Lunatics'\nIsland. Is his head dolichocephalic or brachycephalic?\"\n\nI wasn't going to stand that from Suzanne. I sent her a reply of\none word, economical and to the point:\n\n\"Platycephalic!\"\n\n\nI believe that a well-known anecdote exists to the effect that a young\nwriter, determined to make the commencement of his story forcible and\noriginal enough to catch and rivet the attention of the most blase of\neditors, penned the following sentence:\n\n\" 'Hell!' said the Duchess.\"\n\nStrangely enough, this tale of mine opens in much the same fashion.\nOnly the lady who gave utterance to the exclamation was not a Duchess!\n\nIt was a day in early June. I had been transacting some business in\nParis and was returning by the morning service to London where I was\nstill sharing rooms with my old friend, the Belgian ex-detective,\nHercule Poirot.\n\nThe Calais express was singularly empty--in fact, my own compartment\nheld only one other traveller. I had made a somewhat hurried departure\nfrom the hotel and was busy assuring myself that I had duly collected\nall my traps when the train started. Up till then I had hardly noticed\nmy companion, but I was now violently recalled to the fact of her\nexistence. Jumping up from her seat, she let down the window and stuck\nher head out, withdrawing it a moment later with the brief and forcible\nejaculation \"Hell!\"\n\nNow I am old-fashioned. A woman, I consider, should be womanly. I have\nno patience with the modern neurotic girl who jazzes from morning to\nnight, smokes like a chimney, and uses language which would make a\nBillingsgate fishwoman blush!\n\nI looked up now, frowning slightly, into a pretty, impudent face,\nsurmounted by a rakish little red hat. A thick cluster of black curls\nhid each ear. I judged that she was little more than seventeen, but her\nface was covered with powder, and her lips were quite impossibly\nscarlet.", "Nothing abashed, she returned my glance, and executed an expressive\ngrimace.\n\n\"Dear me, we've shocked the kind gentleman!\" she observed to an\nimaginary audience. \"I apologize for my language! Most unladylike, and\nall that, but Oh, Lord, there's reason enough for it! Do you know I've\nlost my only sister?\"\n\n\"Really?\" I said politely. \"How unfortunate.\"\n\n\"He disapproves!\" remarked the lady. \"He disapproves utterly--of me, and\nmy sister--which last is unfair, because he hasn't seen her!\"\n\nI opened my mouth, but she forestalled me.\n\n\"Say no more! Nobody loves me! I shall go into the garden and eat\nworms! Boohoo! I am crushed!\"\n\nShe buried herself behind a large comic French paper. In a minute or\ntwo I saw her eyes stealthily peeping at me over the top. In spite of\nmyself I could not help smiling, and in a minute she had tossed the\npaper aside, and had burst into a merry peal of laughter.\n\n\"I knew you weren't such a mutt as you looked,\" she cried.\n\nHer laughter was so infectious that I could not help joining in, though\nI hardly cared for the word \"mutt.\" The girl was certainly all that I\nmost disliked, but that was no reason why I should make myself\nridiculous by my attitude. I prepared to unbend. After all, she was\ndecidedly pretty. ...\n\n\"There! Now we're friends!\" declared the minx. \"Say you're sorry about\nmy sister--\"\n\n\"I am desolated!\"\n\n\"That's a good boy!\"\n\n\"Let me finish. I was going to add that, although I am desolated, I can\nmanage to put up with her absence very well.\" I made a little bow.\n\nBut this most unaccountable of damsels frowned and shook her head.\n\n\"Cut it out. I prefer the 'dignified disapproval' stunt. Oh, your face!\n'Not one of us,' it said. And you were right there--though, mind you,\nit's pretty hard to tell nowadays. It's not every one who can\ndistinguish between a demi and a duchess. There now, I believe I've\nshocked you again! You've been dug out of the backwoods, you have. Not\nthat I mind that.", "We could do with a few more of your sort. I just hate\na fellow who gets fresh. It makes me mad.\"\n\nShe shook her head vigorously.\n\n\"What are you like when you're mad?\" I inquired with a smile.\n\n\"A regular little devil! Don't care what I say, or what I do, either! I\nnearly did a chap in once. Yes, really. He'd have deserved it too.\nItalian blood I've got. I shall get into trouble one of these days.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I begged, \"don't get mad with me.\"\n\n\"I shan't. I like you--did the first moment I set eyes on you. But you\nlooked so disapproving that I never thought we should make friends.\"\n\n\"Well, we have. Tell me something about yourself.\"\n\n\"I'm an actress. No--not the kind you're thinking of, lunching at the\nSavoy covered with jewellery, and with their photograph in every paper\nsaying how much they love Madame So and So's face cream. I've been on\nthe boards since I was a kid of six--tumbling.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" I said puzzled.\n\n\"Haven't you seen child acrobats?\"\n\n\"Oh, I understand.\"\n\n\"I'm American born, but I've spent most of my life in England. We got a\nnew show now--\"\n\n\"We?\"\n\n\"My sister and I. Sort of song and dance, and a bit of patter, and a\ndash of the old business thrown in. It's quite a new idea, and it hits\nthem every time. There's to be money in it--\"\n\nMy new acquaintance leaned forward, and discoursed volubly, a great\nmany of her terms being quite unintelligible to me. Yet I found myself\nevincing an increasing interest in her. She seemed such a curious\nmixture of child and woman. Though perfectly worldly-wise, and able, as\nshe expressed it, to take care of herself, there was yet something\ncuriously ingenuous in her single-minded attitude towards life, and her\nwhole-hearted determination to \"make good.\" This glimpse of a world\nunknown to me was not without its charm, and I enjoyed seeing her vivid\nlittle face light up as she talked.\n\nWe passed through Amiens.", "The name awakened many memories. My companion\nseemed to have an intuitive knowledge of what was in my mind.\n\n\"Thinking of the War?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"You were through it, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Pretty well. I was wounded once, and after the Somme they invalided me\nout altogether. I had a half fledged Army job for a bit. I'm a sort of\nprivate secretary now to an M. P.\"\n\n\"My! That's brainy!\"\n\n\"No, it isn't. There's really awfully little to do. Usually a couple of\nhours every day sees me through. It's dull work too. In fact, I don't\nknow what I should do if I hadn't got something to fall back upon.\"\n\n\"Don't say you collect bugs!\"\n\n\"No. I share rooms with a very interesting man. He's a Belgian--an\nex-detective. He's set up as a private detective in London, and he's\ndoing extraordinarily well. He's really a very marvellous little man.\nTime and again he has proved to be right where the official police have\nfailed.\"\n\nMy companion listened with widening eyes.\n\n\"Isn't that interesting, now? I just adore crime. I go to all the\nmysteries on the movies. And when there's a murder on I just devour the\npapers.\"\n\n\"Do you remember the Styles Case?\" I asked.\n\n\"Let me see, was that the old lady who was poisoned? Somewhere down in\nEssex?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"That was Poirot's first big case. Undoubtedly, but for him, the\nmurderer would have escaped scot-free. It was a most wonderful bit of\ndetective work.\"\n\nWarming to my subject, I ran over the heads of the affair, working up\nto the triumphant and unexpected denouement. The girl listened\nspellbound. In fact, we were so absorbed that the train drew into\nCalais station before we realized it.\n\n\"My goodness gracious me!\" cried my companion. \"Where's my\npowder-puff?\"\n\nShe proceeded to bedaub her face liberally, and then applied a stick of\nlip salve to her lips, observing the effect in a small pocket glass,\nand betraying not the faintest sign of self-consciousness.\n\n\"I say,\" I hesitated. \"I dare say it's cheek on my part, but why do all\nthat sort of thing?\"", "The girl paused in her operations, and stared at me with undisguised\nsurprise.\n\n\"It isn't as though you weren't so pretty that you can afford to do\nwithout it,\" I said stammeringly.\n\n\"My dear boy! I've got to do it. All the girls do. Think I want to look\nlike a little frump up from the country?\" She took one last look in the\nmirror, smiled approval, and put it and her vanity-box away in her bag.\n\"That's better. Keeping up appearances is a bit of a fag, I grant, but\nif a girl respects herself it's up to her not to let herself get\nslack.\"\n\nTo this essentially moral sentiment, I had no reply. A point of view\nmakes a great difference.\n\nI secured a couple of porters, and we alighted on the platform. My\ncompanion held out her hand.\n\n\"Good-bye, and I'll mind my language better in future.\"\n\n\"Oh, but surely you'll let me look after you on the boat?\"\n\n\"Mayn't be on the boat. I've got to see whether that sister of mine got\naboard after all anywhere. But thanks all the same.\"\n\n\"Oh, but we're going to meet again, surely? I--\" I hesitated. \"I want to\nmeet your sister.\"\n\nWe both laughed.\n\n\"That's real nice of you. I'll tell her what you say. But I don't fancy\nwe'll meet again. You've been very good to me on the journey,\nespecially after I cheeked you as I did. But what your face expressed\nfirst thing is quite true. I'm not your kind. And that brings\ntrouble--_I___ know that well enough. ...\"\n\nHer face changed. For the moment all the light-hearted gaiety died out\nof it. It looked angry--revengeful. ...\n\n\"So good-bye,\" she finished, in a lighter tone.\n\n\"Aren't you even going to tell me your name?\" I cried, as she turned\naway.\n\nShe looked over her shoulder. A dimple appeared in each cheek. She was\nlike a lovely picture by Greuze.\n\n\"Cinderella,\" she said, and laughed.\n\nBut little did I think when and how I should see Cinderella again.\n\nIt was five minutes past nine when I entered our joint sitting-room for\nbreakfast on the following morning.", "My friend Poirot, exact to the minute as usual, was just tapping the\nshell of his second egg.\n\nHe beamed upon me as I entered.\n\n\"You have slept well, yes? You have recovered from the crossing so\nterrible? It is a marvel, almost you are exact this morning.\n_Pardon___, but your tie is not symmetrical. Permit that I rearrange\nhim.\"\n\nElsewhere, I have described Hercule Poirot. An extraordinary little\nman! Height, five feet four inches, egg-shaped head carried a little to\none side, eyes that shone green when he was excited, stiff military\nmoustache, air of dignity immense! He was neat and dandified in\nappearance. For neatness of any kind, he had an absolute passion. To\nsee an ornament set crooked, or a speck of dust, or a slight disarray\nin one's attire, was torture to the little man until he could ease his\nfeelings by remedying the matter. \"Order\" and \"Method\" were his gods.\nHe had a certain disdain for tangible evidence, such as footprints and\ncigarette ash, and would maintain that, taken by themselves, they would\nnever enable a detective to solve a problem. Then he would tap his\negg-shaped head with absurd complacency, and remark with great\nsatisfaction: \"The true work, it is done from _within___. _The little\ngrey cells___--remember always the little grey cells, _mon ami!___\"\n\nI slipped into my seat, and remarked idly, in answer to Poirot's\ngreeting, that an hour's sea passage from Calais to Dover could hardly\nbe dignified by the epithet \"terrible.\"\n\nPoirot waved his egg-spoon in vigorous refutation of my remark.\n\n\"_Du tout!___ If for an hour one experiences sensations and emotions of\nthe most terrible, one has lived many hours! Does not one of your\nEnglish poets say that time is counted, not by hours, but by\nheart-beats?\"\n\n\"I fancy Browning was referring to something more romantic than sea\nsickness, though.\"\n\n\"Because he was an Englishman, an Islander to whom _la Manche___ was\nnothing. Oh, you English! With _nous autres___ it is different. Figure\nto yourself that a lady of my acquaintance at the beginning of the war\nfled to Ostend.", "There she had a terrible crisis of the nerves.\nImpossible to escape further except by crossing the sea! And she had a\nhorror--_mais une horreur!___--of the sea! What was she to do? Daily _les\nBoches___ were drawing nearer. Imagine to yourself the terrible\nsituation!\"\n\n\"What did she do?\" I inquired curiously.\n\n\"Fortunately her husband was _homme pratique___. He was also very calm,\nthe crises of the nerves, they affected him not. _Il l'a emportee\nsimplement!___ Naturally when she reached England she was prostrate,\nbut she still breathed.\"\n\nPoirot shook his head seriously. I composed my face as best I could.\n\nSuddenly he stiffened and pointed a dramatic finger at the toast rack.\n\n\"Ah, par exemple, c'est trop fort!\" he cried.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"This piece of toast. You remark him not?\" He whipped the offender out\nof the rack, and held it up for me to examine.\n\n\"Is it square? No. Is it a triangle? Again no. Is it even round? No. Is\nit of any shape remotely pleasing to the eye? What symmetry have we\nhere? None.\"\n\n\"It's cut from a cottage loaf,\" I explained soothingly.\n\nPoirot threw me a withering glance.\n\n\"What an intelligence has my friend Hastings!\" he exclaimed\nsarcastically. \"Comprehend you not that I have forbidden such a loaf--a\nloaf haphazard and shapeless, that no baker should permit himself to\nbake!\"\n\nI endeavoured to distract his mind.\n\n\"Anything interesting come by the post?\"\n\nPoirot shook his head with a dissatisfied air.\n\n\"I have not yet examined my letters, but nothing of interest arrives\nnowadays. The great criminals, the criminals of method, they do not\nexist. The cases I have been employed upon lately were _banal___ to the\nlast degree. In verity I am reduced to recovering lost lap-dogs for\nfashionable ladies! The last problem that presented any interest was\nthat intricate little affair of the Yardly diamond, and that was--how\nmany months ago, my friend?\"\n\nHe shook his head despondently, and I roared with laughter.\n\n\"Cheer up, Poirot, the luck will change. Open your letters. For all you\nknow, there may be a great Case looming on the horizon.\"", "Poirot smiled, and taking up the neat little letter opener with which\nhe opened his correspondence he slit the tops of the several envelopes\nthat lay by his plate.\n\n\"A bill. Another bill. It is that I grow extravagant in my old age.\nAha! a note from Japp.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" pricked up my ears. The Scotland Yard Inspector had more than\nonce introduced us to an interesting case.\n\n\"He merely thanks me (in his fashion) for a little point in the\nAberystwyth Case on which I was able to set him right. I am delighted\nto have been of service to him.\"\n\n\"How does he thank you?\" I asked curiously, for I knew my Japp.\n\n\"He is kind enough to say that I am a wonderful sport for my age, and\nthat he was glad to have had the chance of letting me in on the case.\"\n\nThis was so typical of Japp, that I could not forbear a chuckle. Poirot\ncontinued to read his correspondence placidly.\n\n\"A suggestion that I should give a lecture to our local boy scouts. The\nCountess of Forfanock will be obliged if I will call and see her.\nAnother lap-dog without doubt! And now for the last. Ah--\"\n\nI looked up, quick to notice the change of tone. Poirot was reading\nattentively. In a minute he tossed the sheet over to me.\n\n\"This is out of the ordinary, _mon ami___. Read for yourself.\"\n\nThe letter was written on a foreign type of paper, in a bold\ncharacteristic hand:\n\n\"Villa Genevieve\nMerlinville-sur-Mer\nFrance\n\n\n\"_Dear Sir___,\n\"I am in need of the services of a detective and, for reasons which I\nwill give you later, do not wish to call in the official police. I have\nheard of you from several quarters, and all reports go to show that you\nare not only a man of decided ability, but one who also knows how to be\ndiscreet. I do not wish to trust details to the post, but, on account\nof a secret I possess, I go in daily fear of my life. I am convinced\nthat the danger is imminent, and therefore I beg that you will lose no\ntime in crossing to France.", "I will send a car to meet you at Calais, if\nyou will wire me when you are arriving. I shall be obliged if you will\ndrop all cases you have on hand, and devote yourself solely to my\ninterests. I am prepared to pay any compensation necessary. I shall\nprobably need your services for a considerable period of time, as it\nmay be necessary for you to go out to Santiago, where I spent several\nyears of my life. I shall be content for you to name your own fee.\n    \"Assuring you once more that the matter is _urgent___,\n\n\n\"Yours faithfully\n\"P. T. RENAULD.\"\n\n\nBelow the signature was a hastily scrawled line, almost illegible: \"For\nGod's sake, come!\"\n\nI handed the letter back with quickened pulses.\n\n\"At last!\" I said. \"Here is something distinctly out of the ordinary.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Poirot meditatively.\n\n\"You will go of course,\" I continued.\n\nPoirot nodded. He was thinking deeply. Finally he seemed to make up his\nmind, and glanced up at the clock. His face was very grave.\n\n\"See you, my friend, there is no time to lose. The Continental express\nleaves Victoria at 11 o'clock. Do not agitate yourself. There is plenty\nof time. We can allow ten minutes for discussion. You accompany me,\n_n'est-ce pas?___\"\n\n\"Well--\"\n\n\"You told me yourself that your employer needed you not for the next\nfew weeks.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right. But this Mr. Renauld hints strongly that his\nbusiness is private.\"\n\n\"Ta-ta-ta. I will manage M. Renauld. By the way, I seem to know the\nname?\"\n\n\"There's a well-known South American millionaire fellow. His name's\nRenauld. I don't know whether it could be the same.\"\n\n\"But without doubt. That explains the mention of Santiago. Santiago is\nin Chile, and Chile it is in South America! Ah, but we progress\nfinely.\"\n\n\"Dear me, Poirot,\" I said, my excitement rising, \"I smell some goodly\nshekels in this. If we succeed, we shall make our fortunes!\"\n\n\"Do not be too sure of that, my friend. A rich man and his money are\nnot so easily parted.", "Me, I have seen a well-known millionaire turn out\na tramful of people to seek for a dropped halfpenny.\"\n\nI acknowledged the wisdom of this.\n\n\"In any case,\" continued Poirot, \"it is not the money which attracts me\nhere. Certainly it will be pleasant to have _carte blanche___ in our\ninvestigations; one can be sure that way of wasting no time, but it is\nsomething a little bizarre in this problem which arouses my interest.\nYou remarked the postscript? How did it strike you?\"\n\nI considered.\n\n\"Clearly he wrote the letter keeping himself well in hand, but at the\nend his self-control snapped and, on the impulse of the moment, he\nscrawled those four desperate words.\"\n\nBut my friend shook his head energetically.\n\n\"You are in error. See you not that while the ink of the signature is\nnearly black, that of the postscript is quite pale?\"\n\n\"Well?\" I said puzzled.\n\n\"_Mon Dieu, mon ami___, but use your little grey cells! Is it not\nobvious? M. Renauld wrote his letter. Without blotting it, he reread it\ncarefully. Then, not on impulse, but deliberately, he added those last\nwords, and blotted the sheet.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"_Parbleu!___ so that it should produce the effect upon me that it has\nupon you.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"_Mais, oui___--to make sure of my coming! He reread the letter and was\ndissatisfied. It was not strong enough!\"\n\nHe paused, and then added softly, his eyes shining with that green\nlight that always betokened inward excitement: \"And so, _mon ami___,\nsince that postscript was added, not on impulse, but soberly, in cold\nblood, the urgency is very great, and we must reach him as soon as\npossible.\"\n\n\"Merlinville,\" I murmured thoughtfully. \"I've heard of it, I think.\"\n\nPoirot nodded.\n\n\"It is a quiet little place--but chic! It lies about midway between\nBolougne and Calais. It is rapidly becoming the fashion. Rich English\npeople who wish to be quiet are taking it up. M. Renauld has a house in\nEngland, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, in Rutland Gate, as far as I remember. Also a big place in the\ncountry, somewhere in Hertfordshire.", "But I really know very little\nabout him, he doesn't do much in a social way. I believe he has large\nSouth American interests in the City, and has spent most of his life\nout in Chile and the Argentino.\"\n\n\"Well, we shall hear all details from the man himself. Come, let us\npack. A small suit-case each, and then a taxi to Victoria.\"\n\n\"And the Countess?\" I inquired with a smile.\n\n\"Ah! _je m'en fiche!___ Her case was certainly not interesting.\"\n\n\"Why so sure of that?\"\n\n\"Because in that case she would have come, not written. A woman cannot\nwait--always remember that, Hastings.\"\n\nEleven o'clock saw our departure from Victoria on our way to Dover.\nBefore starting Poirot had despatched a telegram to Mr. Renauld giving\nthe time of our arrival at Calais. \"I'm surprised you haven't invested\nin a few bottles of some sea sick remedy, Poirot,\" I observed\nmaliciously, as I recalled our conversation at breakfast.\n\nMy friend, who was anxiously scanning the weather, turned a reproachful\nface upon me.\n\n\"Is it that you have forgotten the method most excellent of Laverguier?\nHis system, I practise it always. One balances oneself, if you\nremember, turning the head from left to right, breathing in and out,\ncounting six between each breath.\"\n\n\"H'm,\" I demurred. \"You'll be rather tired of balancing yourself and\ncounting six by the time you get to Santiago, or Buenos Ayres, or\nwherever it is you land.\"\n\n\"_Quelle idee!___ You do not figure to yourself that I shall go to\nSantiago?\"\n\n\"Mr. Renauld suggests it in his letter.\"\n\n\"He did not know the methods of Hercule Poirot. I do not run to and\nfro, making journeys, and agitating myself. My work is done from\nwithin--_here___--\" he tapped his forehead significantly.\n\nAs usual, this remark roused my argumentative faculty.\n\n\"It's all very well, Poirot, but I think you are falling into the habit\nof despising certain things too much. A finger-print has led sometimes\nto the arrest and conviction of a murderer.\"\n\n\"And has, without doubt, hanged more than one innocent man,\" remarked\nPoirot dryly.", "\"But surely the study of finger-prints and footprints, cigarette ash,\ndifferent kinds of mud, and other clues that comprise the minute\nobservation of details--all these are of vital importance?\"\n\n\"But certainly. I have never said otherwise. The trained observer, the\nexpert, without doubt he is useful! But the others, the Hercules\nPoirots, they are above the experts! To them the experts bring the\nfacts, their business is the method of the crime, its logical\ndeduction, the proper sequence and order of the facts; above all, the\ntrue psychology of the case. You have hunted the fox, yes?\"\n\n\"I have hunted a bit, now and again,\" I said, rather bewildered by this\nabrupt change of subject. \"Why?\"\n\n\"_Eh bien___, this hunting of the fox, you need the dogs, no?\"\n\n\"Hounds,\" I corrected gently. \"Yes, of course.\"\n\n\"But yet,\" Poirot wagged his finger at me. \"You did not descend from\nyour horse and run along the ground smelling with your nose and\nuttering loud Ow Ows?\"\n\nIn spite of myself I laughed immoderately. Poirot nodded in a satisfied\nmanner.\n\n\"So. You leave the work of the d-- hounds to the hounds. Yet you demand\nthat I, Hercule Poirot, should make myself ridiculous by lying down\n(possibly on damp grass) to study hypothetical footprints, and should\nscoop up cigarette ash when I do not know one kind from the other.\nRemember the Plymouth Express mystery. The good Japp departed to make a\nsurvey of the railway line. When he returned, I, without having moved\nfrom my apartments, was able to tell him exactly what he had found.\"\n\n\"So you are of the opinion that Japp wasted his time.\"\n\n\"Not at all, since his evidence confirmed my theory. But _I___ should\nhave wasted my time if _I___ had gone. It is the same with so called\n'experts.' Remember the handwriting testimony in the Cavendish Case.\nOne counsel's questioning brings out testimony as to the resemblances,\nthe defence brings evidence to show dissimilarity. All the language is\nvery technical. And the result? What we all knew in the first place.\nThe writing was very like that of John Cavendish.", "And the psychological\nmind is faced with the question 'Why?' Because it was actually his? Or\nbecause some one wished us to think it was his? I answered that\nquestion, _mon ami___, and answered it correctly.\"\n\nAnd Poirot, having effectually silenced, if not convinced me, leaned\nback with a satisfied air.\n\nOn the boat, I knew better than to disturb my friend's solitude. The\nweather was gorgeous, and the sea as smooth as the proverbial\nmill-pond, so I was hardly surprised to hear that Laverguier's method\nhad once more justified itself when a smiling Poirot joined me on\ndisembarking at Calais. A disappointment was in store for us, as no car\nhad been sent to meet us, but Poirot put this down to his telegram\nhaving been delayed in transit.\n\n\"Since it is _carte blanche___, we will hire a car,\" he said\ncheerfully. And a few minutes later saw us creaking and jolting along,\nin the most ramshackle of automobiles that ever plied for hire, in the\ndirection of Merlinville.\n\nMy spirits were at their highest.\n\n\"What gorgeous air!\" I exclaimed. \"This promises to be a delightful\ntrip.\"\n\n\"For you, yes. For me, I have work to do, remember, at our journey's\nend.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" I said cheerfully. \"You will discover all, ensure this Mr.\nRenauld's safety, run the would-be assassins to earth, and all will\nfinish in a blaze of glory.\"\n\n\"You are sanguine, my friend.\"\n\n\"Yes, I feel absolutely assured of success. Are you not the one and\nonly Hercule Poirot?\"\n\nBut my little friend did not rise to the bait. He was observing me\ngravely.\n\n\"You are what the Scotch people call 'fey,' Hastings. It presages\ndisaster.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. At any rate, you do not share my feelings.\"\n\n\"No, but I am afraid.\"\n\n\"Afraid of what?\"\n\n\"I do not know. But I have a premonition--a _je ne sais quoi!___\"\n\nHe spoke so gravely, that I was impressed in spite of myself.\n\n\"I have a feeling,\" he said slowly, \"that this is going to be a big\naffair--a long, troublesome problem that will not be easy to work out.\"", "I would have questioned him further, but we were just coming into the\nlittle town of Merlinville, and we slowed up to inquire the way to the\nVilla Genevieve.\n\n\"Straight on, monsieur, through the town. The Villa Genevieve is about\nhalf a mile the other side. You cannot miss it. A big Villa,\noverlooking the sea.\"\n\nWe thanked our informant, and drove on, leaving the town behind. A fork\nin the road brought us to a second halt. A peasant was trudging towards\nus, and we waited for him to come up to us in order to ask the way\nagain. There was a tiny Villa standing right by the road, but it was\ntoo small and dilapidated to be the one we wanted. As we waited, the\ngate of it swung open and a girl came out.\n\nThe peasant was passing us now, and the driver leaned forward from his\nseat and asked for direction.\n\n\"The Villa Genevieve? Just a few steps up this road to the right,\nmonsieur. You could see it if it were not for the curve.\"\n\nThe chauffeur thanked him, and started the car again. My eyes were\nfascinated by the girl who still stood, with one hand on the gate,\nwatching us. I am an admirer of beauty, and here was one whom nobody\ncould have passed without remark. Very tall, with the proportions of a\nyoung goddess, her uncovered golden head gleaming in the sunlight, I\nswore to myself that she was one of the most beautiful girls I had ever\nseen. As we swung up the rough road, I turned my head to look after\nher.\n\n\"By Jove, Poirot,\" I exclaimed, \"did you see that young goddess.\"\n\nPoirot raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"_Ca commence!___\" he murmured. \"Already you have seen a goddess!\"\n\n\"But, hang it all, wasn't she?\"\n\n\"Possibly. I did not remark the fact.\"\n\n\"Surely you noticed her?\"\n\n\"_Mon ami___, two people rarely see the same thing. You, for instance,\nsaw a goddess. I--\" he hesitated.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I saw only a girl with anxious eyes,\" said Poirot gravely.\n\nBut at that moment we drew up at a big green gate, and, simultaneously,\nwe both uttered an exclamation.", "Before it stood an imposing _sergent de\nville___. He held up his hand to bar our way.\n\n\"You cannot pass, monsieurs.\"\n\n\"But we wish to see Mr. Renauld,\" I cried. \"We have an appointment.\nThis is his Villa, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, but--\"\n\nPoirot leaned forward.\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"M. Renauld was murdered this morning.\"\n\nIn a moment Poirot had leapt from the car, his eyes blazing with\nexcitement. He caught the man by the shoulder.\n\n\"What is that you say? Murdered? When? How?\"\n\nThe _sergent de ville___ drew himself up.\n\n\"I cannot answer any questions, monsieur.\"\n\n\"True. I comprehend.\" Poirot reflected for a minute. \"The Commissary of\nPolice, he is without doubt within?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\nPoirot took out a card, and scribbled a few words on it.\n\n\"_Voila!___ Will you have the goodness to see that this card is sent in\nto the commissary at once?\"\n\nThe man took it and, turning his head over his shoulder, whistled. In a\nfew seconds a comrade joined him and was handed Poirot's message. There\nwas a wait of some minutes, and then a short stout man with a huge\nmoustache came bustling down to the gate. The _sergent de ville___\nsaluted and stood aside.\n\n\"My dear M. Poirot,\" cried the new-comer, \"I am delighted to see you.\nYour arrival is most opportune.\"\n\nPoirot's face had lighted up.\n\n\"M. Bex! This is indeed a pleasure.\" He turned to me. \"This is an\nEnglish friend of mine, Captain Hastings--M. Lucien Bex.\"\n\nThe commissary and I bowed to each other ceremoniously, then M. Bex\nturned once more to Poirot.\n\n\"_Mon vieux___, I have not seen you since 1909, that time in Ostend. I\nheard that you had left the Force?\"\n\n\"So I have. I run a private business in London.\"\n\n\"And you say you have information to give which may assist us?\"\n\n\"Possibly you know it already. You were aware that I had been sent\nfor?\"\n\n\"No. By whom?\"\n\n\"The dead man. It seems he knew an attempt was going to be made on his\nlife. Unfortunately he sent for me too late.\"\n\n\"_Sacri tonnerre!___\" ejaculated the Frenchman.", "\"So he foresaw his own\nmurder? That upsets our theories considerably! But come inside.\"\n\nHe held the gate open, and we commenced walking towards the house. M.\nBex continued to talk:\n\n\"The examining magistrate, M. Hautet, must hear of this at once. He has\njust finished examining the scene of the crime and is about to begin\nhis interrogations. A charming man. You will like him. Most\nsympathetic. Original in his methods, but an excellent judge.\"\n\n\"When was the crime committed?\" asked Poirot.\n\n\"The body was discovered this morning about nine o'clock. Madame\nRenauld's evidence, and that of the doctors goes to show that the death\nmust have occurred about 2 a.m. But enter, I pray of you.\"\n\nWe had arrived at the steps which led up to the front door of the\nVilla. In the hall another _sergent de ville___ was sitting. He rose at\nsight of the commissary.\n\n\"Where is M. Hautet now?\" inquired the latter.\n\n\"In the _salon___, monsieur.\"\n\nM. Bex opened a door to the left of the hall, and we passed in. M.\nHautet and his clerk were sitting at a big round table. They looked up\nas we entered. The commissary introduced us, and explained our\npresence.\n\nM. Hautet, the Juge d'Instruction, was a tall, gaunt man, with piercing\ndark eyes, and a neatly cut grey beard, which he had a habit of\ncaressing as he talked. Standing by the mantelpiece was an elderly man,\nwith slightly stooping shoulders, who was introduced to us as Dr.\nDurand.\n\n\"Most extraordinary,\" remarked M. Hautet, as the commissary finished\nspeaking. \"You have the letter here, monsieur?\"\n\nPoirot handed it to him, and the magistrate read it.\n\n\"H'm. He speaks of a secret. What a pity he was not more explicit. We\nare much indebted to you, M. Poirot. I hope you will do us the honour\nof assisting us in our investigations. Or are you obliged to return to\nLondon?\"\n\n\"M. le juge, I propose to remain. I did not arrive in time to prevent\nmy client's death, but I feel myself bound in honour to discover the\nassassin.\"", "The magistrate bowed.\n\n\"These sentiments do you honour. Also, without doubt, Madame Renauld\nwill wish to retain your services. We are expecting M. Giraud from the\nSurete in Paris any moment, and I am sure that you and he will be able\nto give each other mutual assistance in your investigations. In the\nmeantime, I hope that you will do me the honour to be present at my\ninterrogations, and I need hardly say that if there is any assistance\nyou require it is at your disposal.\"\n\n\"I thank you, monsieur. You will comprehend that at present I am\ncompletely in the dark. I know nothing whatever.\"\n\nM. Hautet nodded to the commissary, and the latter took up the tale:\n\n\"This morning, the old servant Francoise, on descending to start her\nwork, found the front door ajar. Feeling a momentary alarm as to\nburglars, she looked into the dining-room, but seeing the silver was\nsafe she thought no more about it, concluding that her master had,\nwithout doubt, risen early, and gone for a stroll.\"\n\n\"Pardon, monsieur, for interrupting, but was that a common practice of\nhis?\"\n\n\"No, it was not, but old Francoise has the common idea as regards the\nEnglish--that they are mad, and liable to do the most unaccountable\nthings at any moment! Going to call her mistress as usual, a younger\nmaid, Leonie, was horrified to discover her gagged and bound, and\nalmost at the same moment news was brought that M. Renauld's body had\nbeen discovered, stone dead, stabbed in the back.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"That is one of the most extraordinary features of the case. M. Poirot,\nthe body was lying, face downwards, _in an open grave___.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Yes. The pit was freshly dug--just a few yards outside the boundary of\nthe Villa grounds.\"\n\n\"And he had been dead--how long?\"\n\nDr. Durand answered this.\n\n\"I examined the body this morning at ten o'clock. Death must have taken\nplace at least seven, and possibly ten hours previously.\"\n\n\"H'm, that fixes it at between midnight and 3 a.m.\"\n\n\"Exactly, and Madame Renauld's evidence places it at after 2 a.m.", "which\nnarrows the field still further. Death must have been instantaneous,\nand naturally could not have been self-inflicted.\"\n\nPoirot nodded, and the commissary resumed:\n\n\"Madame Renauld was hastily freed from the cords that bound her by the\nhorrified servants. She was in a terrible condition of weakness, almost\nunconscious from the pain of her bonds. It appears that two masked men\nentered the bedroom, gagged and bound her, whilst forcibly abducting\nher husband. This we know at second hand from the servants. On hearing\nthe tragic news, she fell at once into an alarming state of agitation.\nOn arrival, Dr. Durand immediately prescribed a sedative, and we have\nnot yet been able to question her. But without doubt she will awake\nmore calm, and be equal to bearing the strain of the interrogation.\"\n\nThe commissary paused.\n\n\"And the inmates of the house, monsieur?\"\n\n\"There is old Francoise, the housekeeper, she lived for many years with\nthe former owners of the Villa Genevieve. Then there are two young\ngirls, sisters, Denise and Leonie Oulard. Their home is in Merlinville,\nand they come of the most respectable parents. Then there is the\nchauffeur whom M. Renauld brought over from England with him, but he is\naway on a holiday. Finally there are Madame Renauld and her son, M.\nJack Renauld. He, too, is away from home at present.\"\n\nPoirot bowed his head. M. Hautet spoke:\n\n\"Marchaud!\"\n\nThe _sergent de ville___ appeared.\n\n\"Bring in the woman Francoise.\"\n\nThe man saluted, and disappeared. In a moment or two, he returned,\nescorting the frightened Francoise.\n\n\"You name is Francoise Arrichet?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"You have been a long time in service at the Villa Genevieve?\"\n\n\"Eleven years with Madame la Vicomtesse. Then when she sold the Villa\nthis spring, I consented to remain on with the English milor. Never did\nI imagine--\"\n\nThe magistrate cut her short.\n\n\"Without doubt, without doubt. Now, Francoise, in this matter of the\nfront door, whose business was it to fasten it at night?\"\n\n\"Mine, monsieur. Always I saw to it myself.\"\n\n\"And last night?\"\n\n\"I fastened it as usual.\"", "\"You are sure of that?\"\n\n\"I swear it by the blessed saints, monsieur.\"\n\n\"What time would that be?\"\n\n\"The same time as usual, half-past ten, monsieur.\"\n\n\"What about the rest of the household, had they gone up to bed?\"\n\n\"Madame had retired some time before. Denise and Leonie went up with\nme. Monsieur was still in his study.\"\n\n\"Then, if any one unfastened the door afterwards, it must have been M.\nRenauld himself?\"\n\nFrancoise shrugged her broad shoulders.\n\n\"What should he do that for? With robbers and assassins passing every\nminute! A nice idea! Monsieur was not an imbecile. It is not as though\nhe had had to let _cette dame___ out--\"\n\nThe magistrate interrupted sharply:\n\n\"_Cette dame?___ What lady do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, the lady who came to see him.\"\n\n\"Had a lady been to see him that evening?\"\n\n\"But yes, monsieur--and many other evenings as well.\"\n\n\"Who was she? Did you know her?\"\n\nA rather cunning look spread over the woman's face. \"How should I know\nwho it was?\" she grumbled. \"I did not let her in last night.\"\n\n\"Aha!\" roared the examining magistrate, bringing his hand down with a\nbang on the table. \"You would trifle with the police, would you? I\ndemand that you tell me at once the name of this woman who came to\nvisit M. Renauld in the evenings.\"\n\n\"The police--the police,\" grumbled Francoise. \"Never did I think that I\nshould be mixed up with the police. But I know well enough who she was.\nIt was Madame Daubreuil.\"\n\nThe commissary uttered an exclamation, and leaned forward as though in\nutter astonishment.\n\n\"Madame Daubreuil--from the Villa Marguerite just down the road?\"\n\n\"That is what I said, monsieur. Oh, she is a pretty one, _cellela!___\"\nThe old woman tossed her head scornfully.\n\n\"Madame Daubreuil,\" murmured the commissary. \"Impossible.\"\n\n\"_Voila,___\" grumbled Francoise. \"That is all you get for telling the\ntruth.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said the examining magistrate soothingly. \"We were\nsurprised, that is all. Madame Daubreuil then, and Monsieur Renauld,\nthey were--\" he paused delicately. \"Eh? It was that without doubt?\"", "\"How should I know? But what will you? Monsieur, he was _milor\nanglais___--_tres riche___--and Madame Daubreuil, she was poor, that\none--and _tres chic___ for all that she lives so quietly with her\ndaughter. Not a doubt of it, she has had her history! She is no longer\nyoung, but _ma foi!___ I who speak to you have seen the men's heads\nturn after her as she goes down the street. Besides lately, she has had\nmore money to spend--all the town knows it. The little economies, they\nare at an end.\" And Francoise shook her head with an air of unalterable\ncertainty.\n\nM. Hautet stroked his beard reflectively.\n\n\"And Madame Renauld?\" he asked at length. \"How did she take\nthis--friendship.\"\n\nFrancoise shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"She was always most amiable--most polite. One would say that she\nsuspected nothing. But all the same, is it not so, the heart suffers,\nmonsieur? Day by day, I have watched Madame grow paler and thinner. She\nwas not the same woman who arrived here a month ago. Monsieur, too, has\nchanged. He also has had his worries. One could see that he was on the\nbrink of a crisis of the nerves. And who could wonder, with an affair\nconducted such a fashion? No reticence, no discretion. _Style\nanglais___, without doubt!\"\n\nI bounded indignantly in my seat, but the examining magistrate was\ncontinuing his questions, undistracted by side issues.\n\n\"You say that M. Renauld had not to let Madame Daubreuil out? Had she\nleft, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur. I heard them come out of the study and go to the door.\nMonsieur said good night, and shut the door after her.\"\n\n\"What time was that?\"\n\n\"About twenty-five minutes after ten, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Do you know when M. Renauld went to bed?\"\n\n\"I heard him come up about ten minutes after we did. The stair creaks\nso that one hears every one who goes up and down.\"\n\n\"And that is all? You heard no sound of disturbance during the night?\"\n\n\"Nothing whatever, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Which of the servants came down the first in the morning?\"", "\"I did, monsieur. At once I saw the door swinging open.\"\n\n\"What about the other downstairs windows, were they all fastened?\"\n\n\"Every one of them. There was nothing suspicious or out of place\nanywhere.\"\n\n\"Good, Francoise, you can go.\"\n\nThe old woman shuffled towards the door. On the threshold she looked\nback.\n\n\"I will tell you one thing, monsieur. That Madame Daubreuil she is a\nbad one! Oh, yes, one woman knows about another. She is a bad one,\nremember that.\" And, shaking her head sagely, Francoise left the room.\n\n\"Leonie Oulard,\" called the magistrate.\n\nLeonie appeared dissolved in tears, and inclined to be hysterical. M.\nHautet dealt with her adroitly. Her evidence was mainly concerned with\nthe discovery of her mistress gagged and bound, of which she gave\nrather an exaggerated account. She, like Francoise, had heard nothing\nduring the night.\n\nHer sister, Denise, succeeded her. She agreed that her master had\nchanged greatly of late.\n\n\"Every day he became more and more morose. He ate less. He was always\ndepressed.\" But Denise had her own theory. \"Without doubt it was the\nMafia he had on his track! Two masked men--who else could it be? A\nterrible society that!\"\n\n\"It is, of course, possible,\" said the magistrate smoothly. \"Now, my\ngirl, was it you who admitted Madame Daubreuil to the house last\nnight?\"\n\n\"Not _last___ night, monsieur, the night before.\"\n\n\"But Francoise has just told us that Madame Daubreuil was here last\nnight?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur. A lady _did___ come to see M. Renauld last night, but it\nwas not Madame Daubreuil.\"\n\nSurprised, the magistrate insisted, but the girl held firm. She knew\nMadame Daubreuil perfectly by sight. This lady was dark also, but\nshorter, and much younger. Nothing could shake her statement.\n\n\"Had you ever seen this lady before?\"\n\n\"Never, monsieur.\" And then the girl added diffidently: \"But I think\nshe was English.\"\n\n\"English?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur. She asked for M. Renauld in quite good French, but the\naccent--one can always tell it, _n'est-ce pas?___ Besides when they came\nout of the study they were speaking in English.\"", "\"Did you hear what they said? Could you understand it, I mean?\"\n\n\"Me, I speak the English very well,\" said Denise with pride. \"The lady\nwas speaking too fast for me to catch what she said, but I heard\nMonsieur's last words as he opened the door for her.\" She paused, and\nthen repeated carefully and laboriously:\n\n\" 'Yeas--yeas--butt for Gaud's saike go nauw!' \"\n\n\"Yes, yes, but for God's sake go now!\" repeated the magistrate.\n\nHe dismissed Denise and, after a moment or two for consideration,\nrecalled Francoise. To her he propounded the question as to whether she\nhad not made a mistake in fixing the night of Madame Daubreuil's visit.\nFrancoise, however, proved unexpectedly obstinate. It was last night\nthat Madame Daubreuil had come. Without a doubt it was she. Denise\nwished to make herself interesting, _voila tout!___ So she had cooked\nup this fine tale about a strange lady. Airing her knowledge of English\ntoo! Probably Monsieur had never spoken that sentence in English at\nall, and even if he had, it proved nothing, for Madame Daubreuil spoke\nEnglish perfectly, and generally used that language when talking to M.\nand Madame Renauld. \"You see, M. Jack, the son of Monsieur, was usually\nhere, and he spoke the French very badly.\"\n\nThe magistrate did not insist. Instead he inquired about the chauffeur,\nand learned that only yesterday, M. Renauld had declared that he was\nnot likely to use the car, and that Masters might just as well take a\nholiday.\n\nA perplexed frown was beginning to gather between Poirot's eyes.\n\n\"What is it?\" I whispered.\n\nHe shook his head impatiently, and asked a question:\n\n\"Pardon, M. Bex, but without doubt M. Renauld could drive the car\nhimself?\"\n\nThe commissary looked over at Francoise, and the old woman replied\npromptly:\n\n\"No, Monsieur did not drive himself.\"\n\nPoirot's frown deepened.\n\n\"I wish you would tell me what is worrying you,\" I said impatiently.\n\n\"See you not? In his letter M. Renauld speaks of sending the car for me\nto Calais.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he meant a hired car,\" I suggested.\n\n\"Doubtless that is so.", "But why hire a car when you have one of your\nown. Why choose yesterday to send away the chauffeur on a\nholiday--suddenly, at a moment's notice? Was it that for some reason he\nwanted him out of the way before we arrived?\"\n\nFrancoise had left the room. The magistrate was drumming thoughtfully\non the table.\n\n\"M. Bex,\" he said at length, \"here we have directly conflicting\ntestimony. Which are we to believe, Francoise or Denise?\"\n\n\"Denise,\" said the commissary decidedly. \"It was she who let the\nvisitor in. Francoise is old and obstinate, and has evidently taken a\ndislike to Madame Daubreuil. Besides, our own knowledge tends to show\nthat Renauld was entangled with another woman.\"\n\n\"_Tiens!___\" cried M. Hautet. \"We have forgotten to inform M. Poirot of\nthat.\" He searched amongst the papers on the table, and finally handed\nthe one he was in search of to my friend. \"This letter, M. Poirot, we\nfound in the pocket of the dead man's overcoat.\"\n\nPoirot took it and unfolded it. It was somewhat worn and crumbled, and\nwas written in English in a rather unformed hand:\n\n\"_My dearest one:___\"\nWhy have you not written for so long? You do love me still, don't you?\nYour letters lately have been so different, cold and strange, and now\nthis long silence. It makes me afraid. If you were to stop loving me!\nBut that's impossible--what a silly kid I am--always imagining things!\nBut if you _did___ stop loving me, I don't know what I should do--kill\nmyself perhaps! I couldn't live without you. Sometimes I fancy another\nwoman is coming between us. Let her look out, that's all--and you too!\nI'd as soon kill you as let her have you! I mean it.\n    \"But there, I'm writing high-flown nonsense. You love me, and I\n    love you--yes, love you, love you, love you!\n\n\n\"Your own adoring\n\"BELLA.\"\n\n\nThere was no address or date. Poirot handed it back with a grave face.\n\n\"And the assumption is, M. le juge--?\"\n\nThe examining magistrate shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Obviously M. Renauld was entangled with this Englishwoman--Bella.", "He\ncomes over here, meets Madame Daubreuil, and starts an intrigue with\nher. He cools off to the other, and she instantly suspects something.\nThis letter contains a distinct threat. M. Poirot, at first sight the\ncase seemed simplicity itself. Jealousy! The fact that M. Renauld was\nstabbed in the back seemed to point distinctly to its being a woman's\ncrime.\"\n\nPoirot nodded.\n\n\"The stab in the back, yes--but not the grave! That was laborious work,\nhard work--no woman dug that grave, monsieur. That was a man's doing.\"\n\nThe commissary exclaimed excitedly: \"Yes, yes, you are right. We did\nnot think of that.\"\n\n\"As I said,\" continued M. Hautet, \"at first sight the case seemed\nsimple, but the masked men, and the letter you received from M. Renauld\ncomplicate matters. Here we seem to have an entirely different set of\ncircumstances, with no relationship between the two. As regards the\nletter written to yourself, do you think it is possible that it\nreferred in any way to this 'Bella,' and her threats?\"\n\nPoirot shook his head.\n\n\"Hardly. A man like M. Renauld, who has led an adventurous life in\nout-of-the-way places, would not be likely to ask for protection\nagainst a woman.\"\n\nThe examining magistrate nodded his head emphatically.\n\n\"My view exactly. Then we must look for the explanation of the letter--\"\n\n\"In Santiago,\" finished the commissary. \"I shall cable without delay to\nthe police in that city, requesting full details of the murdered man's\nlife out there, his love affairs, his business transactions, his\nfriendships, and any enmities he may have incurred. It will be strange\nif, after that, we do not hold a clue to his mysterious murder.\"\n\nThe commissary looked round for approval.\n\n\"Excellent,\" said Poirot appreciatively.\n\n\"His wife, too, may be able to give us a pointer,\" added the\nmagistrate.\n\n\"You have found no other letters from this Bella amongst M. Renauld's\neffects?\" asked Poirot.\n\n\"No. Of course one of our first proceedings was to search through his\nprivate papers in the study. We found nothing of interest, however. All\nseemed square and above-board.", "The only thing at all out of the\nordinary was his will. Here it is.\"\n\nPoirot ran through the document.\n\n\"So. A legacy of a thousand pounds to Mr. Stonor--who is he, by the\nway?\"\n\n\"M. Renauld's secretary. He remained in England, but was over here once\nor twice for a week-end.\"\n\n\"And everything else left unconditionally to his beloved wife, Eloise.\nSimply drawn up, but perfectly legal. Witnessed by the two servants,\nDenise and Francoise. Nothing so very unusual about that.\" He handed it\nback.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" began Bex, \"you did not notice--\"\n\n\"The date?\" twinkled Poirot. \"But yes, I noticed it. A fortnight ago.\nPossibly it marks his first intimation of danger. Many rich men die\nintestate through never considering the likelihood of their demise. But\nit is dangerous to draw conclusions prematurely. It points, however, to\nhis having a real liking and fondness for his wife, in spite of his\namorous intrigues.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said M. Hautet doubtfully. \"But it is possibly a little unfair\non his son, since it leaves him entirely dependent on his mother. If\nshe were to marry again, and her second husband obtained an ascendancy\nover her, this boy might never touch a penny of his father's money.\"\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Man is a vain animal. M. Renauld figured to himself, without doubt,\nthat his widow would never marry again. As to the son, it may have been\na wise precaution to leave the money in his mother's hands. The sons of\nrich men are proverbially wild.\"\n\n\"It may be as you say. Now, M. Poirot, you would without doubt like to\nvisit the scene of the crime. I am sorry that the body has been\nremoved, but of course photographs have been taken from every\nconceivable angle, and will be at your disposal as soon as they are\navailable.\"\n\n\"I thank you, monsieur, for all your courtesy.\"\n\nThe commissary rose.\n\n\"Come with me, monsieurs.\"\n\nHe opened the door, and bowed ceremoniously to Poirot to precede him.\nPoirot, with equal politeness, drew back and bowed to the commissary.\n\n\"Monsieur.\"\n\n\"Monsieur.\"\n\nAt last they got out into the hall.", "\"That room there, it is the study, _hein?___\" asked Poirot suddenly,\nnodding towards the door opposite.\n\n\"Yes. You would like to see it?\" He threw the door open as he spoke,\nand we entered.\n\nThe room which M. Renauld had chosen for his own particular use was\nsmall, but furnished with great taste and comfort. A businesslike\nwriting desk, with many pigeon holes, stood in the window. Two large\nleather-covered armchairs faced the fireplace, and between them was a\nround table covered with the latest books and magazines. Bookshelves\nlined two of the walls, and at the end of the room opposite the window\nthere was a handsome oak sideboard with a tantalus on top. The curtains\nand _portiere___ were of a soft dull green, and the carpet matched them\nin tone.\n\nPoirot stood a moment talking in the room, then he stepped forward,\npassed his hand lightly over the backs of the leather chairs, picked up\na magazine from the table, and drew a finger gingerly over the surface\nof the oak sideboard. His face expressed complete approval.\n\n\"No dust?\" I asked, with a smile.\n\nHe beamed on me, appreciative of my knowledge of his peculiarities.\n\n\"Not a particle, _mon ami!___ And for once, perhaps, it is a pity.\"\n\nHis sharp, birdlike eyes darted here and there.\n\n\"Ah!\" he remarked suddenly, with an intonation of relief. \"The\nhearth-rug is crooked,\" and he bent down to straighten it.\n\nSuddenly he uttered an exclamation and rose. In his hand he held a\nsmall fragment of paper.\n\n\"In France, as in England,\" he remarked, \"the domestics omit to sweep\nunder the mats!\"\n\nBex took the fragment from him, and I came closer to examine it.\n\n\"You recognize it--eh, Hastings?\"\n\nI shook my head, puzzled--and yet that particular shade of pink paper\nwas very familiar.\n\nThe commissary's mental processes were quicker than mine.\n\n\"A fragment of a cheque,\" he exclaimed.\n\nThe piece of paper was roughly about two inches square. On it was\nwritten in ink the word \"Duveen.\"\n\n\"_Bien___,\" said Bex. \"This cheque was payable to, or drawn by, one\nnamed Duveen.\"", "\"The former, I fancy,\" said Poirot, \"for, if I am not mistaken, the\nhandwriting is that of M. Renauld.\"\n\nThat was soon established, by comparing it with a memorandum from the\ndesk.\n\n\"Dear me,\" murmured the commissary, with a crestfallen air, \"I really\ncannot imagine how I came to overlook this.\"\n\nPoirot laughed.\n\n\"The moral of that is, always look under the mats! My friend Hastings\nhere will tell you that anything in the least crooked is a torment to\nme. As soon as I saw that the hearth-rug was out of the straight, I\nsaid to myself: '_Tiens!___ The leg of the chair caught it in being\npushed back. Possibly there may be something beneath it which the good\nFrancoise overlooked.' \"\n\n\"Francoise?\"\n\n\"Or Denise, or Leonie. Whoever did this room. Since there is no dust,\nthe room _must___ have been done this morning. I reconstruct the\nincident like this. Yesterday, possibly last night, M. Renauld drew a\ncheque to the order of some one named Duveen. Afterwards it was torn\nup, and scattered on the floor. This morning--\" But M. Bex was already\npulling impatiently at the bell.\n\nFrancoise answered it. Yes, there had been a lot of pieces of paper on\nthe floor. What had she done with them? Put them in the kitchen stove\nof course! What else?\n\nWith a gesture of despair, Bex dismissed her. Then, his face\nlightening, he ran to the desk. In a minute he was hunting through the\ndead man's cheque book. Then he repeated his former gesture. The last\ncounterfoil was blank.\n\n\"Courage!\" cried Poirot, clapping him on the back. \"Without doubt,\nMadame Renauld will be able to tell us all about this mysterious person\nnamed Duveen.\"\n\nThe commissary's face cleared. \"That is true. Let us proceed.\"\n\nAs we turned to leave the room, Poirot remarked casually: \"It was here\nthat M. Renauld received his guest last night, eh?\"\n\n\"It was--but how did you know?\"\n\n\"By _this___. I found it on the back of the leather chair.\"\n\nAnd he held up between his finger and thumb a long black hair--a woman's\nhair!", "M. Bex took us out by the back of the house to where there was a small\nshed leaning against the house. He produced a key from his pocket and\nunlocked it.\n\n\"The body is here. We moved it from the scene of the crime just before\nyou arrived, as the photographers had done with it.\"\n\nHe opened the door and we passed in. The murdered man lay on the\nground, with a sheet over him. M. Bex dexterously whipped off the\ncovering. Renauld was a man of medium height, slender and lithe in\nfigure. He looked about fifty years of age, and his dark hair was\nplentifully streaked with grey. He was clean shaven with a long thin\nnose, and eyes set rather close together, and his skin was deeply\nbronzed, as that of a man who had spent most of his life beneath\ntropical skies. His lips were drawn back from his teeth and an\nexpression of absolute amazement and terror was stamped on the livid\nfeatures.\n\n\"One can see by his face that he was stabbed in the back,\" remarked\nPoirot.\n\nVery gently, he turned the dead man over. There, between the\nshoulder-blades, staining the light fawn overcoat, was a round dark\npatch. In the middle of it there was a slit in the cloth. Poirot\nexamined it narrowly.\n\n\"Have you any idea with what weapon the crime was committed?\"\n\n\"It was left in the wound.\" The commissary reached down a large glass\njar. In it was a small object that looked to me more like a paper-knife\nthan anything else. It had a black handle, and a narrow shining blade.\nThe whole thing was not more than ten inches long. Poirot tested the\ndiscoloured point gingerly with his finger tip.\n\n\"_Ma foi!___ but it is sharp! A nice easy little tool for murder!\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, we could find no trace of fingerprints on it,\" remarked\nBex regretfully. \"The murderer must have worn gloves.\"\n\n\"Of course he did,\" said Poirot contemptuously. \"Even in Santiago they\nknow enough for that. The veriest amateur of an English Mees knows\nit--thanks to the publicity the Bertillon system has been given in the\nPress.", "All the same, it interests me very much that there were no\nfinger-prints. It is so amazingly simple to leave the finger-prints of\nsome one else! And then the police are happy.\" He shook his head. \"I\nvery much fear our criminal is not a man of method--either that or he\nwas pressed for time. But we shall see.\"\n\nHe let the body fall back into its original position.\n\n\"He wore only underclothes under his overcoat, I see,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Yes, the examining magistrate thinks that is rather a curious point.\"\n\nAt this minute there was a tap on the door which Bex had closed after\nhim. He strode forward and opened it. Francoise was there. She\nendeavoured to peep in with ghoulish curiosity.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" demanded Bex impatiently.\n\n\"Madame. She sends a message that she is much recovered, and is quite\nready to receive the examining magistrate.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said M. Bex briskly. \"Tell M. Hautet and say that we will come\nat once.\"\n\nPoirot lingered a moment, looking back towards the body. I thought for\na moment that he was going to apostrophize it, to declare aloud his\ndetermination never to rest till he had discovered the murderer. But\nwhen he spoke, it was tamely and awkwardly, and his comment was\nludicrously inappropriate to the solemnity of the moment.\n\n\"He wore his overcoat very long,\" he said constrainedly.\n\nWe found M. Hautet awaiting us in the hall, and we all proceeded\nupstairs together, Francoise marching ahead to show us the way. Poirot\nwent up in a zigzag fashion which puzzled me, until he whispered with a\ngrimace:\n\n\"No wonder the servants heard M. Renauld mounting the stairs; not a\nboard of them but creaks fit to wake the dead!\"\n\nAt the head of the staircase, a small passage branched off.\n\n\"The servants' quarters,\" explained Bex.\n\nWe continued along a corridor, and Francoise tapped on the last door to\nthe right of it.\n\nA faint voice bade us enter, and we passed into a large sunny apartment\nlooking out towards the sea, which showed blue and sparkling about a\nquarter of a mile distant.", "On a couch, propped up with cushions, and attended by Dr. Durand, lay a\ntall, striking-looking woman. She was middle-aged, and her once dark\nhair was now almost entirely silvered, but the intense vitality and\nstrength of her personality would have made itself felt anywhere. You\nknew at once that you were in the presence of what the French call\n\"_une maitresse femme___.\"\n\nShe greeted us with a dignified inclination of the head.\n\n\"Pray be seated, monsieurs.\"\n\nWe took chairs, and the magistrate's clerk established himself at a\nround table.\n\n\"I hope, madame,\" began M. Hautet, \"that it will not distress you\nunduly to relate to us what occurred last night?\"\n\n\"Not at all, monsieur. I know the value of time, if these scoundrelly\nassassins are to be caught and punished.\"\n\n\"Very well, madame. It will fatigue you less, I think, if I ask you\nquestions and you confine yourself to answering them. At what time did\nyou go to bed last night?\"\n\n\"At half-past nine, monsieur. I was tired.\"\n\n\"And your husband?\"\n\n\"About an hour later, I fancy.\"\n\n\"Did he seem disturbed--upset in any way?\"\n\n\"No, not more than usual.\"\n\n\"What happened then?\"\n\n\"We slept. I was awakened by a hand being pressed over my mouth. I\ntried to scream out, but the hand prevented me. There were two men in\nthe room. They were both masked.\"\n\n\"Can you describe them at all, madame?\"\n\n\"One was very tall, and had a long black beard, the other was short and\nstout. His beard was reddish. They both wore hats pulled down over\ntheir eyes.\"\n\n\"H'm,\" said the magistrate thoughtfully, \"too much beard, I fear.\"\n\n\"You mean they were false?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame. But continue your story.\"\n\n\"It was the short man who was holding me. He forced a gag into my\nmouth, and then bound me with rope hand and foot. The other man was\nstanding over my husband. He had caught up my little dagger paper-knife\nfrom the dressing-table and was holding it with the point just over his\nheart. When the short man had finished with me, he joined the other,\nand they forced my husband to get up and accompany them into the\ndressing-room next door.", "I was nearly fainting with terror,\nnevertheless I listened desperately.\n\n\"They were speaking in too low a tone for me to hear what they said.\nBut I recognized the language, a bastard Spanish such as is spoken in\nsome parts of South America. They seemed to be demanding something from\nmy husband, and presently they grew angry, and their voices rose a\nlittle. I think the tall man was speaking. 'You know what we want!' he\nsaid. '_The secret!___ Where is it?' I do not know what my husband\nanswered, but the other replied fiercely: 'You lie! We know you have\nit. Where are your keys?'\n\n\"Then I heard sounds of drawers being pulled out. There is a safe on\nthe wall of my husband's dressing-room in which he always keeps a\nfairly large amount of ready money. Leonie tells me this has been\nrifled and the money taken, but evidently what they were looking for\nwas not there, for presently I heard the tall man, with an oath,\ncommand my husband to dress himself. Soon after that, I think some\nnoise in the house must have disturbed them, for they hustled my\nhusband out into my room only half dressed.\"\n\n\"_Pardon___,\" interrupted Poirot, \"but is there then no other egress\nfrom the dressing-room?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, there is only the communicating door into my room. They\nhurried my husband through, the short man in front, and the tall man\nbehind him with the dagger still in his hand. Paul tried to break away\nto come to me. I saw his agonized eyes. He turned to his captors. 'I\nmust speak to her,' he said. Then, coming to the side of the bed, 'It\nis all right, Eloise,' he said. 'Do not be afraid. I shall return\nbefore morning.' But, although he tried to make his voice confident, I\ncould see the terror in his eyes. Then they hustled him out of the\ndoor, the tall man saying: 'One sound--and you are a dead man,\nremember.'\n\n\"After that,\" continued Mrs. Renauld, \"I must have fainted. The next\nthing I recollect is Leonie rubbing my wrists, and giving me brandy.\"", "\"Madame Renauld,\" said the magistrate, \"had you any idea what it was\nfor which the assassins were searching?\"\n\n\"None whatever, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Had you any knowledge that your husband feared something?\"\n\n\"Yes. I had seen the change in him.\"\n\n\"How long ago was that?\"\n\nMrs. Renauld reflected.\n\n\"Ten days perhaps.\"\n\n\"Not longer?\"\n\n\"Possibly. I only noticed it then.\"\n\n\"Did you question your husband at all as to the cause?\"\n\n\"Once. He put me off evasively. Nevertheless, I was convinced that he\nwas suffering some terrible anxiety. However, since he evidently wished\nto conceal the fact from me, I tried to pretend that I had noticed\nnothing.\"\n\n\"Were you aware that he had called in the services of a detective?\"\n\n\"A detective?\" exclaimed Mrs. Renauld, very much surprised.\n\n\"Yes, this gentleman--M. Hercule Poirot.\" Poirot bowed. \"He arrived\ntoday in response to a summons from your husband.\" And taking the\nletter written by M. Renauld from his pocket he handed it to the lady.\n\nShe read it with apparently genuine astonishment.\n\n\"I had no idea of this. Evidently he was fully cognizant of the\ndanger.\"\n\n\"Now, madame, I will beg of you to be frank with me. Is there any\nincident in your husband's past life in South America which might throw\nlight on his murder?\"\n\nMrs. Renauld reflected deeply, but at last shook her head.\n\n\"I can think of none. Certainly my husband had many enemies, people he\nhad got the better of in some way or another, but I can think of no one\ndistinctive case. I do not say there is no such incident--only that I am\nnot aware of it.\"\n\nThe examining magistrate stroked his beard disconsolately.\n\n\"And you can fix the time of this outrage?\"\n\n\"Yes, I distinctly remember hearing the clock on the mantelpiece strike\ntwo.\" She nodded towards an eight-day travelling clock in a leather\ncase which stood in the centre of the chimney-piece.\n\nPoirot rose from his seat, scrutinized the clock carefully, and nodded,\nsatisfied.\n\n\"And here too,\" exclaimed M. Bex, \"is a wrist watch, knocked off the\ndressing-table by the assassins, without doubt, and smashed to atoms.", "Little did they know it would testify against them.\"\n\nGently he picked away the fragments of broken glass. Suddenly his face\nchanged to one of utter stupefaction.\n\n\"_Mon Dieu!___\" he ejaculated.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"The hands of the watch point to seven o'clock!\"\n\n\"What?\" cried the examining magistrate, astonished.\n\nBut Poirot, deft as ever, took the broken trinket from the startled\ncommissary, and held it to his ear. Then he smiled.\n\n\"The glass is broken, yes, but the watch itself is still going.\"\n\nThe explanation of the mystery was greeted with a relieved smile. But\nthe magistrate bethought him of another point.\n\n\"But surely it is not seven o'clock now?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Poirot gently, \"it is a few minutes after five. Possibly the\nwatch gains, is that so, madame?\"\n\nMrs. Renauld was frowning perplexedly.\n\n\"It does gain,\" she admitted, \"but I've never known it to gain quite so\nmuch as that.\"\n\nWith a gesture of impatience, the magistrate left the matter of the\nwatch and proceeded with his interrogatory.\n\n\"Madame, the front door was found ajar. It seems almost certain that\nthe murderers entered that way, yet it has not been forced at all. Can\nyou suggest any explanation?\"\n\n\"Possibly my husband went out for a stroll the last thing, and forgot\nto latch it when he came in.\"\n\n\"Is that a likely thing to happen?\"\n\n\"Very. My husband was the most absent-minded of men.\"\n\nThere was a slight frown on her brow as she spoke, as though this trait\nin the dead man's character had at times vexed her.\n\n\"There is one inference I think we might draw,\" remarked the commissary\nsuddenly. \"Since the men insisted on M. Renauld dressing himself, it\nlooks as though the place they were taking him to, the place where 'the\nsecret' was concealed, lay some distance away.\"\n\nThe magistrate nodded.\n\n\"Yes, far, and yet not too far, since he spoke of being back by\nmorning.\"\n\n\"What times does the last train leave the station of Merlinville?\"\nasked Poirot.\n\n\"Eleven-fifty one way, and 12:17 the other, but it is more probable\nthat they had a motor waiting.\"", "\"Of course,\" agreed Poirot, looking somewhat crestfallen.\n\n\"Indeed, that might be one way of tracing them,\" continued the\nmagistrate, brightening. \"A motor containing two foreigners is quite\nlikely to have been noticed. That is an excellent point, M. Bex.\"\n\nHe smiled to himself, and then, becoming grave once more, he said to\nMrs. Renauld:\n\n\"There is another question. Do you know any one of the name of\n'Duveen'?\"\n\n\"Duveen?\" Mrs. Renauld repeated, thoughtfully. \"No, for the moment, I\ncannot say I do.\"\n\n\"You have never heard your husband mention any one of that name?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Do you know any one whose Christian name is Bella?\"\n\nHe watched Mrs. Renauld narrowly as he spoke, seeking to surprise any\nsigns of anger or consciousness, but she merely shook her head in quite\na natural manner. He continued his questions.\n\n\"Are you aware that your husband had a visitor last night?\"\n\nNow he saw the red mount slightly in her cheeks, but she replied\ncomposedly.\n\n\"No, who was that?\"\n\n\"A lady.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\nBut for the moment the magistrate was content to say no more. It seemed\nunlikely that Madame Daubreuil had any connection with the crime, and\nhe was anxious not to upset Mrs. Renauld more than necessary.\n\nHe made a sign to the commissary, and the latter replied with a nod.\nThen rising, he went across the room, and returned with the glass jar\nwe had seen in the outhouse in his hand. From this, he took the dagger.\n\n\"Madame,\" he said gently, \"do you recognize this?\"\n\nShe gave a little cry.\n\n\"Yes, that is my little dagger.\" Then--she saw the stained point, and\nshe drew back, her eyes widening with horror. \"Is that--blood?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame. Your husband was killed with this weapon.\" He removed it\nhastily from sight. \"You are quite sure about it's being the one that\nwas on your dressing-table last night?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. It was a present from my son. He was in the Air Force during\nthe War. He gave his age as older than it was.\" There was a touch of\nthe proud mother in her voice.", "\"This was made from a streamline\naeroplane wire, and was given to me by my son as a souvenir of the\nWar.\"\n\n\"I see, madame. That brings us to another matter. Your son, where is he\nnow? It is necessary that he should be telegraphed to without delay.\"\n\n\"Jack? He is on his way to Buenos Ayres.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Yes. My husband telegraphed to him yesterday. He had sent him on\nbusiness to Paris, but yesterday he discovered that it would be\nnecessary for him to proceed without delay to South America. There was\na boat leaving Cherbourg for Buenos Ayres last night, and he wired him\nto catch it.\"\n\n\"Have you any knowledge of what the business in Buenos Ayres was?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, I know nothing of its nature, but Buenos Ayres is not my\nson's final destination. He was going overland from there to Santiago.\"\n\nAnd, in unison, the magistrate and the commissary exclaimed:\n\n\"Santiago! Again Santiago!\"\n\nIt was at this moment, when we were all stunned by the mention of that\nword, that Poirot approached Mrs. Renauld. He had been standing by the\nwindow like a man lost in a dream, and I doubt if he had fully taken in\nwhat had passed. He paused by the lady's side with a bow.\n\n\"_Pardon___, madame, but may I examine your wrists.\"\n\nThough slightly surprised at the request, Mrs. Renauld held them out to\nhim. Round each of them was a cruel red mark where the cords had bitten\ninto the flesh. As he examined them, I fancied that a momentary flicker\nof excitement I had seen in his eyes disappeared.\n\n\"They must cause you great pain,\" he said, and once more he looked\npuzzled.\n\nBut the magistrate was speaking excitedly.\n\n\"Young M. Renauld must be communicated with at once by wireless. It is\nvital that we should know anything he can tell us about this trip to\nSantiago.\" He hesitated. \"I hoped he might have been near at hand, so\nthat we could have saved you pain, madame.\" He paused.\n\n\"You mean,\" she said in a low voice, \"the identification of my\nhusband's body?\"", "The magistrate bowed his head.\n\n\"I am a strong woman, monsieur. I can bear all that is required of me.\nI am ready--now.\"\n\n\"Oh, tomorrow will be quite soon enough, I assure you--\"\n\n\"I prefer to get it over,\" she said in a low tone, a spasm of pain\ncrossing her face. \"If you will be so good as to give me your arm,\nDoctor?\"\n\nThe doctor hastened forward, a cloak was thrown over Mrs. Renauld's\nshoulders, and a slow procession went down the stairs. M. Bex hurried\non ahead to open the door of the shed. In a minute or two Mrs. Renauld\nappeared in the doorway. She was very pale, but resolute. Behind her,\nM. Hautet was clacking commiserations and apologies like an animated\nhen.\n\nShe raised her hand to her face.\n\n\"A moment, messieurs, while I steel myself.\"\n\nShe took her hand away and looked down at the dead man. Then the\nmarvellous self-control which had upheld her so far deserted her.\n\n\"Paul!\" she cried. \"Husband! Oh, God!\" And pitching forward she fell\nunconscious to the ground.\n\nInstantly Poirot was beside her, he raised the lid of her eye, felt her\npulse. When he had satisfied himself that she had really fainted, he\ndrew aside. He caught me by the arm.\n\n\"I am an imbecile, my friend! If ever there was love and grief in a\nwoman's voice, I heard it then. My little idea was all wrong. _Eh\nbien!___ I must start again!\"\n\nBetween them, the doctor and M. Hautet carried the unconscious woman\ninto the house. The commissary looked after them, shaking his head.\n\n\"_Pauvre femme___,\" he murmured to himself. \"The shock was too much for\nher. Well, well, we can do nothing. Now, M. Poirot, shall we visit the\nplace where the crime was committed?\"\n\n\"If you please, M. Bex.\"\n\nWe passed through the house, and out by the front door. Poirot had\nlooked up at the staircase in passing, and shook his head in a\ndissatisfied manner.\n\n\"It is to me incredible that the servants heard nothing. The creaking\nof that staircase, with _three___ people descending it, would awaken\nthe dead!\"", "\"It was the middle of the night, remember. They were sound asleep by\nthen.\"\n\nBut Poirot continued to shake his head as though not fully accepting\nthe explanation. On the sweep of the drive, he paused, looking up at\nthe house.\n\n\"What moved them in the first place to try if the front door were open?\nIt was a most unlikely thing that it should be. It was far more\nprobable that they should at once try to force a window.\"\n\n\"But all the windows on the ground floor are barred with iron\nshutters,\" objected the commissary.\n\nPoirot pointed to a window on the first floor.\n\n\"That is the window of the bedroom we have just come from, is it not?\nAnd see--there is a tree by which it would be the easiest thing in the\nworld to mount.\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" admitted the other. \"But they could not have done so\nwithout leaving footprints in the flower-bed.\"\n\nI saw the justice of his words. There were two large oval flower-beds\nplanted with scarlet geraniums, one each side of the steps leading up\nto the front door. The tree in question had its roots actually at the\nback of the bed itself, and it would have been impossible to reach it\nwithout stepping on the bed.\n\n\"You see,\" continued the commissary, \"owing to the dry weather no\nprints would show on the drive or paths; but, on the soft mould of the\nflower-bed, it would have been a very different affair.\"\n\nPoirot went close to the bed and studied it attentively. As Bex had\nsaid, the mould was perfectly smooth. There was not an indentation on\nit anywhere.\n\nPoirot nodded, as though convinced, and we turned away, but he suddenly\ndarted off and began examining the other flower-bed.\n\n\"M. Bex!\" he called. \"See here. Here are plenty of traces for you.\"\n\nThe commissary joined him--and smiled.\n\n\"My dear M. Poirot, those are without doubt the footprints of the\ngardener's large hobnailed boots. In any case, it would have no\nimportance, since this side we have no tree, and consequently no means\nof gaining access to the upper story.\"", "\"True,\" said Poirot, evidently crestfallen. \"So you think these\nfootprints are of no importance?\"\n\n\"Not the least in the world.\"\n\nThen, to my utter astonishment, Poirot pronounced these words:\n\n\"I do not agree with you. I have a little idea that these footprints\nare the most important things we have seen yet.\"\n\nM. Bex said nothing, merely shrugged his shoulders. He was far too\ncourteous to utter his real opinion.\n\n\"Shall we proceed?\" he asked instead.\n\n\"Certainly. I can investigate this matter of the footprints later,\"\nsaid Poirot cheerfully.\n\nInstead of following the drive down to the gate, M. Bex turned up a\npath that branched off at right angles. It led, up a slight incline,\nround to the right of the house, and was bordered on either side by a\nkind of shrubbery. Suddenly it emerged into a little clearing from\nwhich one obtained a view of the sea. A seat had been placed here, and\nnot far from it was a rather ramshackle shed. A few steps further on, a\nneat line of small bushes marked the boundary of the Villa grounds. M.\nBex pushed his way through these and we found ourselves on a wide\nstretch of open downs. I looked round, and saw something that filled me\nwith astonishment.\n\n\"Why, this is a golf course,\" I cried.\n\nBex nodded.\n\n\"The limits are not completed yet,\" he explained. \"It is hoped to be\nable to open them sometime next month. It was some of the men working\non them who discovered the body early this morning.\"\n\nI gave a gasp. A little to my left, where for the moment I had\noverlooked it, was a long narrow pit, and by it, face downwards, was\nthe body of a man! For a moment, my heart gave a terrible leap, and I\nhad a wild fancy that the tragedy had been duplicated. But the\ncommissary dispelled my illusion by moving forward with a sharp\nexclamation of annoyance:\n\n\"What have my police been about? They had strict orders to allow no one\nnear the place without proper credentials!\"\n\nThe man on the ground turned his head over his shoulder.", "\"But I have proper credentials,\" he remarked, and rose slowly to his\nfeet.\n\n\"My dear M. Giraud,\" cried the commissary. \"I had no idea that you had\narrived, even. The examining magistrate has been awaiting you with the\nutmost impatience.\"\n\nAs he spoke, I was scanning the new-comer with the keenest curiosity.\nThe famous detective from the Paris Surete was familiar to me by name,\nand I was extremely interested to see him in the flesh. He was very\ntall, perhaps about thirty years of age, with auburn hair and\nmoustache, and a military carriage. There was a trace of arrogance in\nhis manner which showed that he was fully alive to his own importance.\nBex introduced us, presenting Poirot as a colleague. A flicker of\ninterest came into the detective's eye.\n\n\"I know you by name, M. Poirot,\" he said. \"You cut quite a figure in\nthe old days, didn't you? But methods are very different now.\"\n\n\"Crimes, though, are very much the same,\" remarked Poirot gently.\n\nI saw at once that Giraud was prepared to be hostile. He resented the\nother being associated with him, and I felt that if he came across any\nclue of importance he would be more than likely to keep it to himself.\n\n\"The examining magistrate--\" began Bex again. But Giraud interrupted him\nrudely:\n\n\"A fig for the examining magistrate! The light is the important thing.\nFor all practical purposes it will be gone in another half-hour or so.\nI know all about the case, and the people at the house will do very\nwell until tomorrow, but, if we're going to find a clue to the\nmurderers, here is the spot we shall find it. Is it your police who\nhave been trampling all over the place? I thought they knew better\nnowadays.\"\n\n\"Assuredly they do. The marks you complain of were made by the workmen\nwho discovered the body.\"\n\nThe other grunted disgustedly.\n\n\"I can see the tracks where the three of them came through the\nhedge--but they were cunning. You can just recognize the centre\nfootmarks as those of M. Renauld, but those on either side have been\ncarefully obliterated.", "Not that there would really be much to see\nanyway on this hard ground, but they weren't taking any chances.\"\n\n\"The external sign,\" said Poirot. \"That is what you seek, eh?\"\n\nThe other detective stared.\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nA very faint smile came to Poirot's lips. He seemed about to speak, but\nchecked himself. He bent down to where a spade was lying.\n\n\"That's what the grave was dug with, right enough,\" said Giraud. \"But\nyou'll get nothing from it. It was Renauld's own spade, and the man who\nused it wore gloves. Here they are.\" He gesticulated with his foot to\nwhere two soiled earth-stained gloves were lying. \"And they're\nRenauld's too--or at least his gardener's. I tell you, the men who\nplanned out this crime were taking no chances. The man was stabbed with\nhis own dagger, and would have been buried with his own spade. They\ncounted on leaving no traces! But I'll beat them. There's always\n_something!___ And I mean to find it.\"\n\nBut Poirot was now apparently interested in something else, a short\ndiscoloured piece of lead-piping which lay beside the spade. He touched\nit delicately with his finger.\n\n\"And does this, too, belong to the murdered man?\" he asked, and I\nthought I detected a subtle flavour of irony in the question.\n\nGiraud shrugged his shoulders to indicate that he neither knew nor\ncared.\n\n\"May have been lying around here for weeks. Anyway, it doesn't interest\nme.\"\n\n\"I, on the contrary, find it very interesting,\" said Poirot sweetly.\n\nI guessed that he was merely bent on annoying the Paris detective and,\nif so, he succeeded. The other turned away rudely, remarking that he\nhad no time to waste, and bending down he resumed his minute search of\nthe ground.\n\nMeanwhile Poirot, as though struck by a sudden idea, stepped back over\nthe boundary, and tried the door of the little shed.\n\n\"That's locked,\" said Giraud over his shoulder. \"But it's only a place\nwhere the gardener keeps his rubbish. The spade didn't come from there,\nbut from the toolshed up by the house.\"", "\"Marvellous,\" murmured M. Bex, to me ecstatically. \"He has been here\nbut half an hour, and he already knows everything! What a man!\nUndoubtedly Giraud is the greatest detective alive today.\"\n\nAlthough I disliked the detective heartily, I nevertheless was secretly\nimpressed. Efficiency seemed to radiate from the man. I could not help\nfeeling that, so far, Poirot had not greatly distinguished himself, and\nit vexed me. He seemed to be directing his attention to all sorts of\nsilly, puerile points that had nothing to do with the case. Indeed, at\nthis juncture, he suddenly asked:\n\n\"M. Bex, tell me, I pray you, the meaning of this whitewashed line that\nextends all round the grave. Is it a device of the police?\"\n\n\"No, M. Poirot, it is an affair of the golf course. It shows that there\nis here to be a 'bunkair,' as you call it.\"\n\n\"A bunkair?\" Poirot turned to me. \"That is the irregular hole filled\nwith sand and a bank at one side, is it not?\"\n\nI concurred.\n\n\"You do not play the golf, M. Poirot?\" inquired Bex.\n\n\"I? Never! What a game!\" He became excited. \"Figure to yourself, each\nhole it is of a different length. The obstacles, they are not arranged\nmathematically. Even the greens are frequently up one side! There is\nonly one pleasing thing--the how do you call them?--tee boxes! They, at\nleast, are symmetrical.\"\n\nI could not refrain from a laugh at the way the game appeared to\nPoirot, and my little friend smiled at me affectionately, bearing no\nmalice. Then he asked:\n\n\"But M. Renauld, without doubt he played the golf?\"\n\n\"Yes, he was a keen golfer. It's mainly owing to him, and to his large\nsubscriptions, that this work is being carried forward. He even had a\nsay in the designing of it.\"\n\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.\n\nThen he remarked:\n\n\"It was not a very good choice they made--of a spot to bury the body?\nWhen the men began to dig up the ground, all would have been\ndiscovered.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" cried Giraud triumphantly. \"And that _proves___ that they\nwere strangers to the place.", "It's an excellent piece of indirect\nevidence.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Poirot doubtfully. \"No one who knew would bury a body\nthere--unless--unless--they _wanted___ it to be discovered. And that is\nclearly absurd, is it not?\"\n\nGiraud did not even trouble to reply.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Poirot, in a somewhat dissatisfied voice.\n\"Yes--undoubtedly--absurd!\"\n\nAs we retraced our steps to the house, M. Bex excused himself for\nleaving us, explaining that he must immediately acquaint the examining\nmagistrate with the fact of Giraud's arrival. Giraud himself had been\nobviously delighted when Poirot declared that he had seen all he\nwanted. The last thing we observed, as we left the spot, was Giraud,\ncrawling about on all fours, with a thoroughness in his search that I\ncould not but admire. Poirot guessed my thoughts, for as soon as we\nwere alone he remarked ironically:\n\n\"At last you have seen the detective you admire--the human foxhound! Is\nit not so, my friend?\"\n\n\"At any rate, he's _doing___ something,\" I said, with asperity. \"If\nthere's anything to find, he'll find it. Now you--\"\n\n\"_Eh bien!___ I also have found something! A piece of lead-piping.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Poirot. You know very well that's got nothing to do with it.\nI meant _little___ things--traces that may lead us infallibly to the\nmurderers.\"\n\n\"_Mon ami___, a clue of two feet long is every bit as valuable as one\nmeasuring two millimetres! But it is the romantic idea that all\nimportant clues must be infinitesimal! As to the piece of lead-piping\nhaving nothing to do with the crime, you say that because Giraud told\nyou so. No\"--as I was about to interpose a question--\"we will say no\nmore. Leave Giraud to his search, and me to my ideas. The case seems\nstraightforward enough--and yet--and yet, _mon ami___, I am not\nsatisfied! And do you know why? Because of the wrist watch that is two\nhours fast. And then there are several curious little points that do\nnot seem to fit in. For instance, if the object of the murderers was\nrevenge, why did they not stab Renauld in his sleep and have done with\nit?\"", "\"They wanted the 'secret,' \" I reminded him.\n\nPoirot brushed a speck of dust from his sleeve with a dissatisfied air.\n\n\"Well, where is this 'secret'? Presumably some distance away, since\nthey wish him to dress himself. Yet he is found murdered close at hand,\nalmost within ear-shot of the house. Then again, it is pure chance that\na weapon such as the dagger should be lying about casually, ready to\nhand.\"\n\nHe paused frowning, and then went on:\n\n\"Why did the servants hear nothing? Were they drugged? Was there an\naccomplice and did that accomplice see to it that the front door should\nremain open? I wonder if--\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly. We had reached the drive in front of the house.\nSuddenly he turned to me.\n\n\"My friend, I am about to surprise you--to please you! I have taken your\nreproaches to heart! We will examine some footprints!\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"In that right-hand bed yonder. M. Bex says that they are the footmarks\nof the gardener. Let us see if that is so. See, he approaches with his\nwheelbarrow.\"\n\nIndeed an elderly man was just crossing the drive with a barrowful of\nseedlings. Poirot called to him, and he set down the barrow and came\nhobbling towards us.\n\n\"You are going to ask him for one of his boots to compare with the\nfootmarks?\" I asked breathlessly. My faith in Poirot revived a little.\nSince he said the footprints in this right-hand bed were important,\npresumably they _were___.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Poirot.\n\n\"But won't he think it very odd?\"\n\n\"He will not think about it at all.\"\n\nWe could say no more, for the old man had joined us.\n\n\"You want me for something, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Yes. You have been gardener here a long time, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Twenty-four years, monsieur.\"\n\n\"And your name is--?\"\n\n\"Auguste, monsieur.\"\n\n\"I was admiring these magnificent geraniums. They are truly superb.\nThey have been planted long?\"\n\n\"Some time, monsieur. But of course, to keep the beds looking smart,\none must keep bedding out a few new plants, and remove those that are\nover, besides keeping the old blooms well picked off.\"", "\"You put in some new plants yesterday, didn't you? Those in the middle\nthere, and in the other bed also?\"\n\n\"Monsieur has a sharp eye. It takes always a day or so for them to\n'pick up.' Yes, I put ten new plants in each bed last night. As\nMonsieur doubtless knows, one should not put in plants when the sun is\nhot.\"\n\nAuguste was charmed with Poirot's interest, and was quite inclined to\nbe garrulous.\n\n\"That is a splendid specimen there,\" said Poirot, pointing. \"Might I\nperhaps have a cutting of it?\"\n\n\"But certainly, monsieur.\" The old fellow stepped into the bed, and\ncarefully took a slip from the plant Poirot had admired.\n\nPoirot was profuse in his thanks, and Auguste departed to his barrow.\n\n\"You see?\" said Poirot with a smile, as he bent over the bed to examine\nthe indentation of the gardener's hobnailed boot. \"It is quite simple.\"\n\n\"I did not realize--\"\n\n\"That the foot would be inside the boot? You do not use your excellent\nmental capacities sufficiently. Well, what of the footmark?\"\n\nI examined the bed carefully.\n\n\"All the footmarks in the bed were made by the same boot,\" I said at\nlength after a careful study.\n\n\"You think so? _Eh bien___, I agree with you,\" said Poirot.\n\nHe seemed quite uninterested, and as though he were thinking of\nsomething else.\n\n\"At any rate,\" I remarked, \"you will have one bee less in your bonnet\nnow.\"\n\n\"_Mon Dieu!___ But what an idiom! What does it mean?\"\n\n\"What I meant was that now you will give up your interest in these\nfootmarks.\"\n\nBut to my surprise Poirot shook his head.\n\n\"No, no, _mon ami___. At last I am on the right track. I am still in\nthe dark, but, as I hinted just now to M. Bex, these footmarks are the\nmost important and interesting things in the case! That poor Giraud--I\nshould not be surprised if he took no notice of them whatever.\"\n\nAt that moment, the front door opened, and M. Hautet and the commissary\ncame down the steps.\n\n\"Ah, M. Poirot, we were coming to look for you,\" said the magistrate.", "\"It is getting late, but I wish to pay a visit to Madame Daubreuil.\nWithout doubt she will be very much upset by M. Renauld's death, and we\nmay be fortunate enough to get a clue from her. The secret that he did\nnot confide to his wife, it is possible that he may have told it to the\nwoman whose love held him enslaved. We know where our Samsons are weak,\ndon't we?\"\n\nI admired the picturesqueness of M. Hautet's language. I suspected that\nthe examining magistrate was by now thoroughly enjoying his part in the\nmysterious drama.\n\n\"Is M. Giraud not going to accompany us?\" asked Poirot.\n\n\"M. Giraud has shown clearly that he prefers to conduct the case in his\nown way,\" said M. Hautet dryly. One could see easily enough that\nGiraud's cavalier treatment of the examining magistrate had not\nprejudiced the latter in his favour. We said no more, but fell into\nline. Poirot walked with the examining magistrate, and the commissary\nand I followed a few paces behind.\n\n\"There is no doubt that Francoise's story is substantially correct,\" he\nremarked to me in a confidential tone. \"I have been telephoning\nheadquarters. It seems that three times in the last six weeks--that is\nto say since the arrival of M. Renauld at Merlinville--Madame Daubreuil\nhas paid a large sum in notes into her banking account. Altogether the\nsum totals two hundred thousand francs!\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" I said, considering, \"that must be something like four\nthousand pounds!\"\n\n\"Precisely. Yes, there can be no doubt that he was absolutely\ninfatuated. But it remains to be seen whether he confided his secret to\nher. The examining magistrate is hopeful, but I hardly share his\nviews.\"\n\nDuring this conversation we were walking down the lane towards the fork\nin the road where our car had halted earlier in the afternoon, and in\nanother moment I realized that the Villa Marguerite, the home of the\nmysterious Madame Daubreuil, was the small house from which the\nbeautiful girl had emerged.\n\n\"She has lived here for many years,\" said the commissary, nodding his\nhead towards the house.", "\"Very quietly, very unobtrusively. She seems to\nhave no friends or relations other than the acquaintances she has made\nin Merlinville. She never refers to the past, nor to her husband. One\ndoes not even know if he is alive or dead. There is a mystery about\nher, you comprehend.\" I nodded, my interest growing.\n\n\"And--the daughter?\" I ventured.\n\n\"A truly beautiful young girl--modest, devout, all that she should be.\nOne pities her, for, though she may know nothing of the past, a man who\nwants to ask her hand in marriage must necessarily inform himself, and\nthen--\" The commissary shrugged his shoulders cynically.\n\n\"But it would not be her fault!\" I cried, with rising indignation.\n\n\"No. But what will you? A man is particular about his wife's\nantecedents.\"\n\nI was prevented from further argument by our arrival at the door. M.\nHautet rang the bell. A few minutes elapsed, and then we heard a\nfootfall within, and the door was opened. On the threshold stood my\nyoung goddess of that afternoon. When she saw us, the colour left her\ncheeks, leaving her deathly white, and her eyes widened with\napprehension. There was no doubt about it, she was afraid!\n\n\"Mademoiselle Daubreuil,\" said M. Hautet, sweeping off his hat, \"we\nregret infinitely to disturb you, but the exigencies of the Law--you\ncomprehend? My compliments to Madame your mother, and will she have the\ngoodness to grant me a few moments' interview.\"\n\nFor a moment the girl stood motionless. Her left hand was pressed to\nher side, as though to still the sudden unconquerable agitation of her\nheart. But she mastered herself, and said in a low voice:\n\n\"I will go and see. Please come inside.\"\n\nShe entered a room on the left of the hall, and we heard the low murmur\nof her voice. And then another voice, much the same in timbre, but with\na slightly harder inflection behind its mellow roundness said:\n\n\"But certainly. Ask them to enter.\"\n\nIn another minute we were face to face with the mysterious Madame\nDaubreuil.\n\nShe was not nearly so tall as her daughter, and the rounded curves of\nher figure had all the grace of full maturity.", "Her hair, again unlike\nher daughter's, was dark, and parted in the middle in the madonna\nstyle. Her eyes, half hidden by the drooping lids, were blue. There was\na dimple in the round chin, and the half parted lips seemed always to\nhover on the verge of a mysterious smile. There was something almost\nexaggeratedly feminine about her, at once yielding and seductive.\nThough very well preserved, she was certainly no longer young, but her\ncharm was of the quality which is independent of age.\n\nStanding there, in her black dress with the fresh white collar and\ncuffs, her hands clasped together, she looked subtly appealing and\nhelpless.\n\n\"You wished to see me, monsieur?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes, madame.\" M. Hautet cleared his throat. \"I am investigating the\ndeath of M. Renauld. You have heard of it, no doubt?\"\n\nShe bowed her head without speaking. Her expression did not change.\n\n\"We came to ask you whether you can--er--throw any light upon the\ncircumstances surrounding it?\"\n\n\"I?\" The surprise of her tone was excellent.\n\n\"Yes, madame. It would, perhaps, be better if we could speak to you\nalone.\" He looked meaningly in the direction of the girl.\n\nMadame Daubreuil turned to her.\n\n\"Marthe, dear--\"\n\nBut the girl shook her head.\n\n\"No, _maman___, I will not go. I am not a child. I am twenty-two. I\nshall not go.\"\n\nMadame Daubreuil turned back to the examining magistrate.\n\n\"You see, monsieur.\"\n\n\"I should prefer not to speak before Mademoiselle Daubreuil.\"\n\n\"As my daughter says, she is not a child.\"\n\nFor a moment the magistrate hesitated, baffled.\n\n\"Very well, madame,\" he said at last. \"Have it your own way. We have\nreason to believe that you were in the habit of visiting the dead man\nat his Villa in the evenings. Is that so?\"\n\nThe colour rose in the lady's pale cheeks, but she replied quietly:\n\n\"I deny your right to ask me such a question!\"\n\n\"Madame, we are investigating a murder.\"\n\n\"Well, what of it? I had nothing to do with the murder.\"\n\n\"Madame, we do not say that for a moment.", "But you knew the dead man\nwell. Did he ever confide in you as to any danger that threatened him?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Did he ever mention his life in Santiago, and any enemies he may have\nmade there?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then you can give us no help at all?\"\n\n\"I fear not. I really do not see why you should come to me. Cannot his\nwife tell you what you want to know?\" Her voice held a slender\ninflection of irony.\n\n\"Madame Renauld has told us all she can.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Madame Daubreuil. \"I wonder--\"\n\n\"You wonder what, madame?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nThe examining magistrate looked at her. He was aware that he was\nfighting a duel, and that he had no mean antagonist.\n\n\"You persist in your statement that M. Renauld confided nothing in\nyou?\"\n\n\"Why should you think it likely that he should confide in me?\"\n\n\"Because, madame,\" said M. Hautet, with calculated brutality. \"A man\ntells to his mistress what he does not always tell to his wife.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" she sprang forward. Her eyes flashed fire. \"Monsieur, you insult\nme! And before my daughter! I can tell you nothing. Have the goodness\nto leave my house!\"\n\nThe honours undoubtedly rested with the lady. We left the Villa\nMarguerite like a shamefaced pack of schoolboys. The magistrate\nmuttered angry ejaculations to himself. Poirot seemed lost in thought.\nSuddenly he came out of his reverie with a start, and inquired of M.\nHautet if there was a good hotel near at hand.\n\n\"There is a small place, the Hotel des Bains, on this side of town. A\nfew hundred yards down the road. It will be handy for your\ninvestigations. We shall see you in the morning then, I presume?\"\n\n\"Yes, I thank you, M. Hautet.\"\n\nWith mutual civilities, we parted company, Poirot and I going towards\nMerlinville, and the others returning to the Villa Genevieve.\n\n\"The French police system is very marvellous,\" said Poirot, looking\nafter them. \"The information they possess about every one's life, down\nto the most commonplace detail, is extraordinary. Though he has only\nbeen here a little over six weeks, they are perfectly well acquainted\nwith M. Renauld's tastes and pursuits, and at a moment's notice they\ncan produce information as to Madame Daubreuil's banking account, and\nthe sums that have lately been paid in!", "Undoubtedly the _dossier___ is\na great institution. But what is that?\" He turned sharply.\n\nA figure was running hatless, down the road after us. It was Marthe\nDaubreuil.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" she cried breathlessly, as she reached us. \"I--I\nshould not do this, I know. You must not tell my mother. But is it\ntrue, what the people say, that M. Renauld called in a detective before\nhe died, and--and that you are he?\"\n\n\"Yes, mademoiselle,\" said Poirot gently. \"It is quite true. But how did\nyou learn it?\"\n\n\"Francoise told our Amelie,\" explained Marthe, with a blush.\n\nPoirot made a grimace.\n\n\"The secrecy, it is impossible in an affair of this kind! Not that it\nmatters. Well, mademoiselle, what is it you want to know?\"\n\nThe girl hesitated. She seemed longing, yet fearing, to speak. At last,\nalmost in a whisper, she asked:\n\n\"Is--any one suspected?\"\n\nPoirot eyed her keenly.\n\nThen he replied evasively:\n\n\"Suspicion is in the air at present, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know--but--any one in particular?\"\n\n\"Why do you want to know?\"\n\nThe girl seemed frightened by the question. All at once Poirot's words\nabout her earlier in the day recurred to me. The \"girl with the anxious\neyes!\"\n\n\"M. Renauld was always very kind to me,\" she replied at last. \"It is\nnatural that I should be interested.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Poirot. \"Well, mademoiselle, suspicion at present is\nhovering round two persons.\"\n\n\"Two?\"\n\nI could have sworn there was a note of surprise and relief in her\nvoice.\n\n\"Their names are unknown, but they are presumed to be Chilians from\nSantiago. And now, mademoiselle, you see what comes of being young and\nbeautiful! I have betrayed professional secrets for you!\"\n\nThe girl laughed merrily, and then, rather shyly, she thanked him.\n\n\"I must run back now. _Maman___ will miss me.\"\n\nAnd she turned and ran back up the road, looking like a modern\nAtalanta. I stared after her.\n\n\"_Mon ami___,\" said Poirot, in his gentle ironical voice, \"is it that\nwe are to remain planted here all night--just because you have seen a\nbeautiful young woman, and your head is in a whirl?\"", "I laughed and apologized.\n\n\"But she _is___ beautiful, Poirot. Any one might be excused for being\nbowled over by her.\"\n\nPoirot groaned.\n\n\"_Mon Dieu!___ But it is that you have the susceptible heart!\"\n\n\"Poirot,\" I said, \"do you remember after the Styles Case when--\"\n\n\"When you were in love with two charming women at once, and neither of\nthem were for you? Yes, I remember.\"\n\n\"You consoled me by saying that perhaps some day we should hunt\ntogether again, and that then--\"\n\n\"_Eh bien?___\"\n\n\"Well, we are hunting together again, and--\" I paused, and laughed\nrather self-consciously.\n\nBut to my surprise Poirot shook his head very earnestly.\n\n\"Ah, _mon ami___, do not set your heart on Marthe Daubreuil. She is not\nfor you, that one! Take it from Papa Poirot!\"\n\n\"Why,\" I cried, \"the commissary assured me that she was as good as she\nis beautiful! A perfect angel!\"\n\n\"Some of the greatest criminals I have known had the faces of angels,\"\nremarked Poirot cheerfully. \"A malformation of the grey cells may\ncoincide quite easily with the face of a madonna.\"\n\n\"Poirot,\" I cried, horrified, \"you cannot mean that you suspect an\ninnocent child like this!\"\n\n\"Ta-ta-ta! Do not excite yourself! I have not said that I suspected\nher. But you must admit that her anxiety to know about the case is\nsomewhat unusual.\"\n\n\"For once, I see further than you do,\" I said. \"Her anxiety is not for\nherself--but for her mother.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said Poirot, \"as usual, you see nothing at all. Madame\nDaubreuil is very well able to look after herself without her daughter\nworrying about her. I admit I was teasing you just now, but all the\nsame I repeat what I said before. Do not set your heart on that girl.\nShe is not for you! I, Hercule Poirot, know it. _Sacre!___ if only I\ncould remember where I had seen that face!\"\n\n\"What face?\" I asked, surprised. \"The daughter's?\"\n\n\"No. The mother's.\"\n\nNoting my surprise, he nodded emphatically.\n\n\"But yes--it is as I tell you. It was a long time ago, when I was still\nwith the Police in Belgium.", "I have never actually seen the woman\nbefore, but I have seen her picture--and in connection with some case. I\nrather fancy--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I may be mistaken, but I rather fancy that it was a murder case!\"\n\nWe were up at the Villa betimes next morning. The man on guard at the\ngate did not bar our way this time. Instead, he respectfully saluted\nus, and we passed on to the house. The maid Leonie was just coming down\nthe stairs, and seemed not averse to the prospect of a little\nconversation.\n\nPoirot inquired after the health of Mrs. Renauld.\n\nLeonie shook her head.\n\n\"She is terribly upset, _la pauvre dame!___ She will eat nothing--but\nnothing! And she is as pale as a ghost. It is heartrending to see her.\nAh, _par exemple___, it is not I who would grieve like that for a man\nwho had deceived me with another woman!\"\n\nPoirot nodded sympathetically.\n\n\"What you say is very just, but what will you? The heart of a woman who\nloves will forgive many blows. Still, undoubtedly there must have been\nmany scenes of recrimination between them in the last few months?\"\n\nAgain Leonie shook her head.\n\n\"Never, monsieur. Never have I heard Madame utter a word of protest--of\nreproach, even! She had the temper and disposition of an angel--quite\ndifferent to Monsieur.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Renauld had not the temper of an angel?\"\n\n\"Far from it. When he enraged himself, the whole house knew of it. The\nday that he quarrelled with M. Jack--_ma foi!___ they might have been\nheard in the market place, they shouted so loud!\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Poirot. \"And when did this quarrel take place?\"\n\n\"Oh! it was just before M. Jack went to Paris. Almost he missed his\ntrain. He came out of the library, and caught up his bag which he had\nleft in the hall. The automobile, it was being repaired, and he had to\nrun for the station. I was dusting the salon, and I saw him pass, and\nhis face was white--white--with two burning spots of red.", "Ah, but he was\nangry!\"\n\nLeonie was enjoying her narrative thoroughly.\n\n\"And the dispute, what was it about?\"\n\n\"Ah, that I do not know,\" confessed Leonie. \"It is true that they\nshouted, but their voices were so loud and high, and they spoke so\nfast, that only one well acquainted with English could have\ncomprehended. But Monsieur, he was like a thundercloud all day!\nImpossible to please him!\"\n\nThe sound of a door shutting upstairs cut short Leonie's loquacity.\n\n\"And Francoise who awaits me!\" she exclaimed, awakening to a tardy\nremembrance of her duties. \"That old one, she always scolds.\"\n\n\"One moment, mademoiselle. The examining magistrate, where is he?\"\n\n\"They have gone out to look at the automobile in the garage. Monsieur\nthe commissary had some idea that it might have been used on the night\nof the murder.\"\n\n\"_Quelle idee___,\" murmured Poirot, as the girl disappeared.\n\n\"You will go out and join them?\"\n\n\"No, I shall await their return in the _salon___. It is cool there on\nthis hot morning.\"\n\nThis placid way of taking things did not quite commend itself to me.\n\n\"If you don't mind--\" I said, and hesitated.\n\n\"Not in the least. You wish to investigate on your own account, eh?\"\n\n\"Well, I'd rather like to have a look at Giraud, if he's anywhere\nabout, and see what he's up to.\"\n\n\"The human foxhound,\" murmured Poirot, as he leaned back in a\ncomfortable chair, and closed his eyes. \"By all means, my friend. Au\nrevoir.\"\n\nI strolled out of the front door. It was certainly hot. I turned up the\npath we had taken the day before. I had a mind to study the scene of\nthe crime myself. I did not go directly to the spot, however, but\nturned aside into the bushes, so as to come out on the links some\nhundred yards or so further to the right. If Giraud were still on the\nspot, I wanted to observe his methods before he knew of my presence.\nBut the shrubbery here was much denser, and I had quite a struggle to\nforce my way through.", "When I emerged at last on the course, it was\nquite unexpectedly and with such vigour that I cannoned heavily into a\nyoung lady who had been standing with her back to the plantation.\n\nShe not unnaturally gave a suppressed shriek, but I, too, uttered an\nexclamation of surprise. For it was my friend of the train, Cinderella!\n\nThe surprise was mutual.\n\n\"You,\" we both exclaimed simultaneously.\n\nThe young lady recovered herself first.\n\n\"My only Aunt!\" she exclaimed. \"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"For the matter of that, what are you?\" I retorted.\n\n\"When last I saw you, the day before yesterday, you were trotting home\nto England like a good little boy. Have they given you a season ticket\nto and fro, on the strength of your M.P.?\"\n\nI ignored the end of the speech.\n\n\"When last I saw you,\" I said, \"you were trotting home with your\nsister, like a good little girl. By the way, how is your sister?\"\n\nA flash of white teeth rewarded me.\n\n\"How kind of you to ask! My sister is well, I thank you.\"\n\n\"She is here with you?\"\n\n\"She remained in town,\" said the minx with dignity.\n\n\"I don't believe you've got a sister,\" I laughed. \"If you have, her\nname is Harris!\"\n\n\"Do you remember mine?\" she asked, with a smile.\n\n\"Cinderella. But you're going to tell me the real one now, aren't you?\"\n\nShe shook her head with a wicked look.\n\n\"Not even why you're here?\"\n\n\"Oh, that! I suppose you've heard of members of my profession\n'resting.' \"\n\n\"At expensive French watering-places?\"\n\n\"Dirt cheap if you know where to go.\"\n\nI eyed her keenly.\n\n\"Still, you'd no intention of coming here when I met you two days ago?\"\n\n\"We all have our disappointments,\" said Miss Cinderella sententiously.\n\"There now, I've told you quite as much as is good for you. Little boys\nshould not be inquisitive. You've not yet told me what you're doing\nhere? Got the M.P. in tow, I suppose, doing the gay boy on the beach.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Guess again. You remember my telling you that my\ngreat friend was a detective?\"", "\"Yes?\"\n\n\"And perhaps you've heard about this crime--at the Villa Genevieve--?\"\n\nShe stared at me. Her breast heaved, and her eyes grew wide and round.\n\n\"You don't mean--that you're in on _that?___\"\n\nI nodded. There was no doubt that I had scored heavily. Her emotion, as\nshe regarded me, was only too evident. For some few seconds, she\nremained silent, staring at me. Then she nodded her head emphatically.\n\n\"Well, if that doesn't beat the band! Tote me round. I want to see all\nthe horrors.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"What I say. Bless the boy, didn't I tell you I doted on crimes? What\ndo you think I'm imperilling my ankles for in high-heeled shoes over\nthis stubble? I've been nosing round for hours. Tried the front way in,\nbut that old stick-in-the-mud of a French gendarme wasn't taking any. I\nguess Helen of Troy, and Cleopatra, and Mary, Queen of Scots, rolled in\none wouldn't cut ice with him! It's a real piece of luck happening on\nyou this way. Come on, show me all the sights.\"\n\n\"But look here--wait a minute--I can't. Nobody's allowed in. They're\nawfully strict.\"\n\n\"Aren't you and your friend the big bugs?\"\n\nI was loath to relinquish my position of importance.\n\n\"Why are you so keen?\" I asked weakly. \"And what is it you want to\nsee.\"\n\n\"Oh, everything! The place where it happened, and the weapon, and the\nbody, and any finger-prints or interesting things like that. I've never\nhad a chance of being right in on a murder like this before. It'll last\nme all my life?\"\n\nI turned away, sickened. What were women coming to nowadays? The girl's\nghoulish excitement nauseated me. I had read of the mobs of women who\nbesieged the law courts when some wretched man was being tried for his\nlife on the capital charge. I had sometimes wondered who these women\nwere. Now I knew. They were of the likeness of Cinderella, young, yet\nobsessed with a yearning for morbid excitement, for sensation at any\nprice, without regard to any decency or good feeling.", "The vividness of\nthe girl's beauty had attracted me in spite of myself, yet at heart I\nretained my first impression of disapproval and dislike. I thought of\nmy mother, long since dead. What would she have said of this strange\nmodern product of girlhood? The pretty face with the paint and powder,\nand the ghoulish mind behind!\n\n\"Come off your high horse,\" said the lady suddenly. \"And don't give\nyourself airs. When you got called to this job, did you put your nose\nin the air and say it was a nasty business, and you wouldn't be mixed\nup in it?\"\n\n\"No, but--\"\n\n\"If you'd been here on a holiday, wouldn't you be nosing round just the\nsame as I am? Of course you would.\"\n\n\"I'm a man. You're a woman.\"\n\n\"Your idea of a woman is some one who gets on a chair and shrieks if\nshe sees a mouse. That's all prehistoric. But you _will___ show me\nround, won't you? You see, it might make a big difference to me.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"They're keeping all the reporters out. I might make a big scoop with\none of the papers. You don't know how much they pay for a bit of inside\nstuff.\"\n\nI hesitated. She slipped a small soft hand into mine.\n\n\"_Please___--there's a dear.\"\n\nI capitulated. Secretly, I knew that I should rather enjoy the part of\nshowman. After all, the moral attitude displayed by the girl was none\nof my business. I was a little nervous as to what the examining\nmagistrate might say, but I reassured myself by the reflection that no\nharm could possibly be done.\n\nWe repaired first to the spot where the body had been discovered. A man\nwas on guard there, who saluted respectfully, knowing me by sight, and\nraised no question as to my companion. Presumably he regarded her as\nvouched for by me. I explained to Cinderella just how the discovery had\nbeen made, and she listened attentively, sometimes putting an\nintelligent question. Then we turned our steps in the direction of the\nVilla. I proceeded rather cautiously, for, truth to tell, I was not at\nall anxious to meet any one.", "I took the girl through the shrubbery\nround to the back of the house where the small shed was. I recollected\nthat yesterday evening, after relocking the door, M. Bex had left the\nkey with the _sergent de ville___ Marchaud, \"in case M. Giraud should\nrequire it while we are upstairs.\" I thought it quite likely that the\nSurete detective, after using it, had returned it to Marchaud again.\nLeaving the girl out of sight in the shrubbery, I entered the house.\nMarchaud was on duty outside the door of the _salon___. From within\ncame the murmur of voices.\n\n\"Monsieur desires Hautet? He is within. He is again interrogating\nFrancoise.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said hastily, \"I don't want him. But I should very much like\nthe key of the shed outside if it is not against regulations.\"\n\n\"But certainly, monsieur.\" He produced it. \"Here it is. M. le juge gave\norders that all facilities were to be placed at your disposal. You will\nreturn it to me when you have finished out there, that is all.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nI felt a thrill of satisfaction as I realized that in Marchaud's eyes,\nat least, I ranked equally in importance with Poirot. The girl was\nwaiting for me. She gave an exclamation of delight as she saw the key\nin my hand.\n\n\"You've got it then?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I said coolly. \"All the same, you know, what I'm doing is\nhighly irregular.\"\n\n\"You've been a perfect duck, and I shan't forget it. Come along. They\ncan't see us from the house, can they?\"\n\n\"Wait a minute.\" I arrested her eager advance. \"I won't stop you if you\nreally wish to go in. But do you? You've seen the grave, and the\ngrounds, and you've heard all the details of the affair. Isn't that\nenough for you? This is going to be gruesome, you know,\nand--unpleasant.\"\n\nShe looked at me for a moment with an expression that I could not quite\nfathom. Then she laughed.\n\n\"Me for the horrors,\" she said. \"Come along.\"\n\nIn silence we arrived at the door of the shed.", "I opened it and we\npassed in. I walked over to the body, and gently pulled down the sheet\nas M. Bex had done the preceding afternoon. A little gasping sound\nescaped from the girl's lips, and I turned and looked at her. There was\nhorror on her face now, and those debonair high spirits of hers were\nquenched utterly. She had not chosen to listen to my advice, and she\nwas punished now for her disregard of it. I felt singularly merciless\ntowards her. She should go through with it now. I turned the corpse\ngently over.\n\n\"You see,\" I said, \"he was stabbed in the back.\"\n\nHer voice was almost soundless.\n\n\"With what?\"\n\nI nodded towards the glass jar.\n\n\"That dagger.\"\n\nSuddenly the girl reeled, and then sank down in a heap. I sprang to her\nassistance.\n\n\"You are faint. Come out of here. It has been too much for you.\"\n\n\"Water,\" she murmured. \"Quick. Water. ...\"\n\nI left her, and rushed into the house. Fortunately none of the servants\nwere about, and I was able to secure a glass of water unobserved and\nadd a few drops of brandy from a pocket flask. In a few minutes I was\nback again. The girl was lying as I had left her, but a few sips of the\nbrandy and water revived her in a marvellous manner.\n\n\"Take me out of here--oh, quickly, quickly!\" she cried, shuddering.\n\nSupporting her with my arm I led her out into the air, and she pulled\nthe door to behind her. Then she drew a deep breath.\n\n\"That's better. Oh, it was horrible! Why did you ever let me go in?\"\n\nI felt this to be so feminine that I could not forbear a smile.\nSecretly, I was not dissatisfied with her collapse. It proved that she\nwas not quite so callous as I had thought her. After all she was little\nmore than a child, and her curiosity had probably been of the\nunthinking order.\n\n\"I did my best to stop you, you know,\" I said gently.\n\n\"I suppose you did. Well, good-bye.\"", "\"Look here, you can't start off like that--all alone. You're not fit for\nit. I insist on accompanying you back to Merlinville.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. I'm quite all right now.\"\n\n\"Supposing you felt faint again? No, I shall come with you.\"\n\nBut this she combated with a good deal of energy. In the end, however,\nI prevailed so far as to be allowed to accompany her to the outskirts\nof the town. We retraced our steps over our former route, passing the\ngrave again, and making a detour on to the road. Where the first\nstraggling line of shops began, she stopped and held out her hand.\n\n\"Good-bye, and thank you ever so much for coming with me.\"\n\n\"Are you sure you're all right now?\"\n\n\"Quite, thanks. I hope you won't get into any trouble over showing me\nthings?\"\n\nI disclaimed the idea lightly.\n\n\"Well, good-bye.\"\n\n\"Au revoir,\" I corrected. \"If you're staying here, we shall meet\nagain.\"\n\nShe flashed a smile at me.\n\n\"That's so. Au revoir, then.\"\n\n\"Wait a second, you haven't told me your address?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm staying at the Hotel du Phare. It's a little place, but quite\ngood. Come and look me up tomorrow.\"\n\n\"I will,\" I said, with perhaps rather unnecessary _empressement___.\n\nI watched her out of sight, then turned and retraced my steps to the\nVilla. I remembered that I had not relocked the door of the shed.\nFortunately no one had noticed the oversight, and turning the key I\nremoved it and returned it to the _sergent de ville___. And, as I did\nso, it came upon me suddenly that though Cinderella had given me her\naddress I still did not know her name.\n\nIn the _Salon___ I found the examining magistrate busily interrogating\nthe old gardener Auguste. Poirot and the commissary, who were both\npresent, greeted me respectively with a smile and a polite bow. I\nslipped quietly into a seat. M. Hautet was painstaking and meticulous\nin the extreme, but did not succeed in eliciting anything of\nimportance.\n\nThe gardening gloves Auguste admitted to be his. He wore them when\nhandling a certain species of primula plant which was poisonous to some\npeople.", "He could not say when he had worn them last. Certainly he had\nnot missed them. Where were they kept? Sometimes in one place,\nsometimes in another. The spade was usually to be found in the small\ntool shed. Was it locked? Of course it was locked. Where was the key\nkept? _Parbleu___, it was in the door of course! There was nothing of\nvalue to steal. Who would have expected a party of bandits, of\nassassins? Such things did not happen in Madame la Vicomtesse's time.\nM. Hautet signifying that he had finished with him, the old man\nwithdrew, grumbling to the last. Remembering Poirot's unaccountable\ninsistence on the footprints in the flower beds, I scrutinized him\nnarrowly as he gave his evidence. Either he had nothing to do with the\ncrime or he was a consummate actor. Suddenly, just as he was going out\nof the door, an idea struck me. \"_Pardon___ M. Hautet,\" I cried, \"but\nwill you permit me to ask him one question?\"\n\n\"But certainly, monsieur.\"\n\nThus encouraged, I turned to Auguste.\n\n\"Where do you keep your boots?\"\n\n\"_Sac a papier!___\" growled the old man. \"On my feet. Where else?\"\n\n\"But when you go to bed at night?\"\n\n\"Under my bed.\"\n\n\"But who cleans them?\"\n\n\"Nobody. Why should they be cleaned? Is it that I promenade myself on\nthe front like a young man? On Sunday I wear the Sunday boots, _bien\nentendu___, but otherwise--!\" he shrugged his shoulders.\n\nI shook my head, discouraged.\n\n\"Well, well,\" said the magistrate. \"We do not advance very much.\nUndoubtedly we are held up until we get the return cable from Santiago.\nHas any one seen Giraud? In verity that one lacks politeness! I have a\nvery good mind to send for him and--\"\n\n\"You will not have to send far, M. le juge.\"\n\nThe quiet voice startled us. Giraud was standing outside looking in\nthrough the open window.\n\nHe leaped lightly into the room, and advanced to the table.\n\n\"Here I am, M. le juge, at your service. Accept my excuses for not\npresenting myself sooner.\"\n\n\"Not at all.", "Not at all,\" said the magistrate, rather confused.\n\n\"Of course I am only a detective,\" continued the other. \"I know nothing\nof interrogatories. Were I conducting one, I should be inclined to do\nso without an open window. Any one standing outside can so easily hear\nall that passes. ... But no matter.\"\n\nM. Hautet flushed angrily. There was evidently going to be no love lost\nbetween the examining magistrate and the detective in charge of the\ncase. They had fallen foul of each other at the start. Perhaps in any\nevent it would have been much the same. To Giraud, all examining\nmagistrates were fools, and to M. Hautet who took himself seriously,\nthe casual manner of the Paris detective could not fail to give\noffence.\n\n\"_Eh bien___, M. Giraud,\" said the magistrate rather sharply. \"Without\ndoubt you have been employing your time to a marvel? You have the names\nof the assassins for us, have you not? And also the precise spot where\nthey find themselves now?\"\n\nUnmoved by this irony, Giraud replied:\n\n\"I know at least where they have come from.\"\n\n\"_Comment?___\"\n\nGiraud took two small objects from his pocket and laid them down on the\ntable. We crowded round. The objects were very simple ones: the stub of\na cigarette, and an unlighted match. The detective wheeled round on\nPoirot.\n\n\"What do you see there?\" he asked.\n\nThere was something almost brutal in his tone. It made my cheeks flush.\nBut Poirot remained unmoved. He shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"A cigarette end, and a match.\"\n\n\"And what does that tell you?\"\n\nPoirot spread out his hands.\n\n\"It tells me--nothing.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Giraud, in a satisfied voice. \"You haven't made a study of\nthese things. That's not an ordinary match--not in this country at\nleast. It's common enough in South America. Luckily it's unlighted. I\nmightn't have recognized it otherwise. Evidently one of the men threw\naway his cigarette end, and lit another, spilling one match out of the\nbox as he did so.\"\n\n\"And the other match?\" asked Poirot.\n\n\"Which match?\"\n\n\"The one he _did___ light his cigarette with.", "You have found that\nalso?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you didn't search very thoroughly.\"\n\n\"Not search thoroughly--\" For a moment it seemed as though the detective\nwere going to break out angrily, but with an effort he controlled\nhimself. \"I see you love a joke, M. Poirot. But in any case, match or\nno match, the cigarette end would be sufficient. It is a South American\ncigarette with liquorice pectoral paper.\"\n\nPoirot bowed. The commissary spoke:\n\n\"The cigarette end and match might have belonged to M. Renauld.\nRemember, it is only two years since he returned from South America.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the other confidently. \"I have already searched among the\neffects of M. Renauld. The cigarettes he smoked and the matches he used\nare quite different.\"\n\n\"You do not think it odd,\" asked Poirot, \"that these strangers should\ncome unprovided with a weapon, with gloves, with a spade, and that they\nshould so conveniently find all these things?\"\n\nGiraud smiled in a rather superior manner.\n\n\"Undoubtedly it is strange. Indeed, without the theory that I hold, it\nwould be inexplicable.\"\n\n\"Aha!\" said M. Hautet. \"An accomplice. An accomplice within the house!\"\n\n\"Or outside it,\" said Giraud with a peculiar smile.\n\n\"But some one must have admitted them? We cannot allow that, by an\nunparalleled piece of good fortune, they found the door ajar for them\nto walk in?\"\n\n\"_D'accord___, M. le juge. The door was opened for them, but it could\njust as easily be opened from outside--by some one who possessed a key.\"\n\n\"But who did possess a key?\"\n\nGiraud shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"As for that, no one who possesses one is going to admit the fact if\nthey can help it. But several people _might___ have had one. M. Jack\nRenauld, the son, for instance. It is true that he is on his way to\nSouth America, but he might have lost the key or had it stolen from\nhim. Then there is the gardener--he has been here many years. One of the\nyounger servants may have a lover. It is easy to take an impression of\na key and have one cut.", "There are many possibilities. Then there is\nanother person who, I should judge, is exceedingly likely to have such\na thing in her keeping.\"\n\n\"Who is that?\"\n\n\"Madame Daubreuil,\" said the detective dryly.\n\n\"Eh, eh!\" said the magistrate, his face falling a little, \"so you have\nheard about that, have you?\"\n\n\"I hear everything,\" said Giraud imperturbably.\n\n\"There is one thing I could swear you have not heard,\" said M. Hautet,\ndelighted to be able to show superior knowledge, and without more ado,\nhe retailed the story of the mysterious visitor the night before. He\nalso touched on the cheque made out to \"Duveen,\" and finally handed\nGiraud the letter signed \"Bella.\"\n\nGiraud listened in silence, studied the letter attentively, and then\nhanded it back.\n\n\"All very interesting, M. le juge. But my theory remains unaffected.\"\n\n\"And your theory is?\"\n\n\"For the moment I prefer not to say. Remember, I am only just beginning\nmy investigations.\"\n\n\"Tell me one thing, M. Giraud,\" said Poirot suddenly. \"Your theory\nallows for the door being opened. It does not explain why it was\n_left___ open. When they departed, would it not have been natural for\nthem to close it behind them. If a _sergent de ville___ had chanced to\ncome up to the house, as is sometimes done to see that all is well,\nthey might have been discovered and overtaken almost at once.\"\n\n\"Bah! They forgot it. A mistake, I grant you.\"\n\nThen, to my surprise, Poirot uttered almost the same words as he had\nuttered to Bex the previous evening:\n\n\"_I do not agree with you.___ The door being left open was the result\nof either design or necessity, and any theory that does not admit that\nfact is bound to prove vain.\"\n\nWe all regarded the little man with a good deal of astonishment. The\nconfession of ignorance drawn from him over the match end had, I\nthought, been bound to humiliate him, but here he was self satisfied as\never, laying down the law to the great Giraud without a tremor.\n\nThe detective twisted his moustache, eyeing my friend in a somewhat\nbantering fashion.", "\"You don't agree with me, eh? Well, what strikes you particularly about\nthe case. Let's hear your views.\"\n\n\"One thing presents itself to me as being significant. Tell me, M.\nGiraud, does nothing strike you as familiar about this case? Is there\nnothing it reminds you of?\"\n\n\"Familiar? Reminds me of? I can't say off-hand. I don't think so,\nthough.\"\n\n\"You are wrong,\" said Poirot quietly. \"A crime almost precisely similar\nhas been committed before.\"\n\n\"When? And where?\"\n\n\"Ah, that, unfortunately, I cannot for the moment remember--but I shall\ndo so. I had hoped you might be able to assist me.\"\n\nGiraud snorted incredulously.\n\n\"There have been many affairs of masked men! I cannot remember the\ndetails of them all. These crimes all resemble each other more or\nless.\"\n\n\"There is such a thing as the individual touch.\" Poirot suddenly\nassumed his lecturing manner, and addressed us collectively. \"I am\nspeaking to you now of the psychology of crime. M. Giraud knows quite\nwell that each criminal has his particular method, and that the police,\nwhen called in to investigate--say a case of burglary--can often make a\nshrewd guess at the offender, simply by the peculiar method he has\nemployed. (Japp would tell you the same, Hastings.) Man is an\nunoriginal animal. Unoriginal within the law in his daily respectable\nlife, equally unoriginal outside the law. If a man commits a crime, any\nother crime he commits will resemble it closely. The English murderer\nwho disposed of his wives in succession by drowning them in their baths\nwas a case in point. Had he varied his methods, he might have escaped\ndetection to this day. But he obeyed the common dictates of human\nnature, arguing that what had once succeeded would succeed again, and\nhe paid the penalty of his lack of originality.\"\n\n\"And the point of all this?\" sneered Giraud.\n\n\"That when you have two crimes precisely similar in design and\nexecution, you find the same brain behind them both. I am looking for\nthat brain, M. Giraud--and I shall find it. Here we have a true clue--a\npsychological clue.", "You may know all about cigarettes and match ends,\nM. Giraud, but I, Hercule Poirot, know the mind of man!\" And the\nridiculous little fellow tapped his forehead with emphasis.\n\nGiraud remained singularly unimpressed.\n\n\"For your guidance,\" continued Poirot, \"I will also advise you of one\nfact which might fail to be brought to your notice. The wrist watch of\nMadame Renauld, on the day following the tragedy, had gained two hours.\nIt might interest you to examine it.\"\n\nGiraud stared.\n\n\"Perhaps it was in the habit of gaining?\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact, I am told it did.\"\n\n\"_Eh bien___, then!\"\n\n\"All the same, two hours is a good deal,\" said Poirot softly. \"Then\nthere is the matter of the footprints in the flower-bed.\"\n\nHe nodded his head towards the open window. Giraud took two eager\nstrides, and looked out.\n\n\"This bed here?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But I see no footprints?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Poirot, straightening a little pile of books on a table.\n\"There are none.\"\n\nFor a moment an almost murderous rage obscured Giraud's face. He took\ntwo strides towards his tormentor, but at that moment the _salon___\ndoor was opened, and Marchaud announced.\n\n\"M. Stonor, the secretary, has just arrived from England. May he\nenter?\"\n\nThe man who entered the room was a striking figure. Very tall, with a\nwell knit athletic frame, and a deeply bronzed face and neck, he\ndominated the assembly. Even Giraud seemed anaemic beside him. When I\nknew him better I realized that Gabriel Stonor was quite an unusual\npersonality. English by birth, he had knocked about all over the world.\nHe had shot big game in Africa, travelled in Korea, ranched in\nCalifornia, and traded in the South Sea Islands. He had been secretary\nto a New York railway magnate, and had spent a year encamped in the\ndesert with a friendly tribe of Arabs.\n\nHis unerring eye picked out M. Hautet.\n\n\"The examining magistrate in charge of the case? Pleased to meet you,\nM. le juge. This is a terrible business. How's Mrs. Renauld? Is she\nbearing up fairly well? It must have been an awful shock to her.\"", "\"Terrible, terrible,\" said M. Hautet. \"Permit me to introduce M.\nBex--our commissary of police, M. Giraud of the Surete. This gentleman\nis M. Hercule Poirot. M. Renauld sent for him, but he arrived too late\nto do anything to avert the tragedy. A friend of M. Poirot's, Captain\nHastings.\"\n\nStonor looked at Poirot with some interest.\n\n\"Sent for you, did he?\"\n\n\"You did not know, then, that M. Renauld contemplated calling in a\ndetective?\" interposed M. Bex.\n\n\"No, I didn't. But it doesn't surprise me a bit.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because the old man was rattled! I don't know what it was all about.\nHe didn't confide in me. We weren't on those terms. But rattled he\nwas--and badly!\"\n\n\"H'm!\" said M. Hautet. \"But you have no notion of the cause?\"\n\n\"That's what I said, sir.\"\n\n\"You will pardon me, M. Stonor, but we must begin with a few\nformalities. Your name?\"\n\n\"Gabriel Stonor.\"\n\n\"How long ago was it that you became secretary to M. Renauld?\"\n\n\"About two years ago, when he first arrived from South America. I met\nhim through a mutual friend, and he offered me the post. A thundering\ngood boss he was too.\"\n\n\"Did he talk to you much about his life in South America?\"\n\n\"Yes, a good bit.\"\n\n\"Do you know if he was ever in Santiago?\"\n\n\"Several times, I believe.\"\n\n\"He never mentioned any special incident that occurred there--anything\nthat might have provoked some vendetta against him?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Did he speak of any secret that he had acquired whilst sojourning\nthere?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Did he ever say anything at all about a secret?\"\n\n\"Not that I can remember. But, for all that, there _was___ a mystery\nabout him. I've never heard him speak of his boyhood for instance, or\nof any incident prior to his arrival in South America. He was a French\nCanadian by birth, I believe, but I've never heard him speak of his\nlife in Canada. He could shut up like a clam if he liked.\"\n\n\"So, as far as you know, he had no enemies, and you can give us no clue\nas to any secret to obtain possession of which he might have been\nmurdered?\"", "\"That's so.\"\n\n\"M. Stonor, have you ever heard the name of Duveen in connection with\nM. Renauld?\"\n\n\"Duveen. Duveen.\" He tried the name over thoughtfully. \"I don't think I\nhave. And yet it seems familiar.\"\n\n\"Do you know a lady, a friend of M. Renauld's whose Christian name is\nBella?\"\n\nAgain Mr. Stonor shook his head.\n\n\"Bella Duveen? Is that the full name? It's curious! I'm sure I know it.\nBut for the moment I can't remember in what connection.\"\n\nThe magistrate coughed.\n\n\"You understand, M. Stonor--the case is like this. _There must be no\nreservations.___ You might, perhaps, through a feeling of consideration\nfor Madame Renauld--for whom, I gather, you have a great esteem and\naffection, you might--_enfin!___\" said M. Hautet getting rather tied up\nin his sentence, \"there must absolutely be no reservations.\"\n\nStonor stared at him, a dawning light of comprehension in his eyes.\n\n\"I don't quite get you,\" he said gently. \"Where does Mrs. Renauld come\nin? I've an immense respect and affection for that lady; she's a very\nwonderful and unusual type, but I don't quite see how my reservations,\nor otherwise, could affect her?\"\n\n\"Not if this Bella Duveen should prove to have been something more than\na friend to her husband?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Stonor. \"I get you now. But I'll bet my bottom dollar that\nyou're wrong. The old man never so much as looked at a petticoat. He\njust adored his own wife. They were the most devoted couple I know.\"\n\nM. Hautet shook his head gently.\n\n\"M. Stonor, we hold absolute proof--a love letter written by this Bella\nto M. Renauld, accusing him of having tired of her. Moreover, we have\nfurther proof that, at the time of his death, he was carrying on an\nintrigue with a Frenchwoman, a Madame Daubreuil, who rents the\nadjoining Villa. And this is the man who, according to you, never\nlooked at a petticoat!\"\n\nThe secretary's eyes narrowed.\n\n\"Hold on, M. le juge. You're barking up the wrong tree. I knew Paul\nRenauld. What you've just been saying is utterly impossible.", "There's\nsome other explanation.\"\n\nThe magistrate shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"What other explanation could there be?\"\n\n\"What leads you to think it was a love affair?\"\n\n\"Madame Daubreuil was in the habit of visiting him here in the\nevenings. Also, since M. Renauld came to the Villa Genevieve, Madame\nDaubreuil has paid large sums of money into the bank in notes. In all,\nthe amount totals four thousand pounds of your English money.\"\n\n\"I guess that's right,\" said Stonor quietly. \"I transmitted him those\nsums at his request. But it wasn't an intrigue.\"\n\n\"Eh! _mon Dieu!___ What else could it be?\"\n\n\"_Blackmail___,\" said Stonor sharply, bringing down his hand with a\nslam on the table. \"That's what it was.\"\n\n\"Ah! Voila une idee!\" cried the magistrate, shaken in spite of himself.\n\n\"Blackmail,\" repeated Stonor. \"The old man was being bled--and at a good\nrate too. Four thousand in a couple of months. Whew! I told you just\nnow there was a mystery about Renauld. Evidently this Madame Daubreuil\nknew enough of it to put the screws on.\"\n\n\"It is possible,\" the commissary cried excitedly. \"Decidedly, it is\npossible.\"\n\n\"Possible?\" roared Stonor. \"It's certain! Tell me, have you asked Mrs.\nRenauld about this love affair stunt of yours?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur. We did not wish to occasion her any distress if it could\nreasonably be avoided.\"\n\n\"Distress? Why, she'd laugh in your face. I tell you, she and Renauld\nwere a couple in a hundred.\"\n\n\"Ah, that reminds me of another point,\" said M. Hautet. \"Did M. Renauld\ntake you into his confidence at all as to the dispositions of his\nwill?\"\n\n\"I know all about it--took it to the lawyer for him after he'd drawn it\nout. I can give you the name of his solicitors if you want to see it.\nThey've got it there. Quite simple. Half in trust to his wife for her\nlifetime, the other half to his son. A few legacies. I rather think he\nleft me a thousand.\"\n\n\"When was this will drawn up?\"\n\n\"Oh, about a year and a half ago.\"\n\n\"Would it surprise you very much, M. Stonor, to hear that M. Renauld\nhad made another will, less than a fortnight ago?\"", "Stonor was obviously very much surprised.\n\n\"I'd no idea of it. What's it like?\"\n\n\"The whole of his vast fortune is left unreservedly to his wife. There\nis no mention of his son.\"\n\nMr. Stonor gave vent to a prolonged whistle.\n\n\"I call that rather rough on the lad. His mother adores him, of course,\nbut to the world at large it looks rather like a want of confidence on\nhis father's part. It will be rather galling to his pride. Still, it\nall goes to prove what I told you, that Renauld and his wife were on\nfirst rate terms.\"\n\n\"Quite so, quite so,\" said M. Hautet. \"It is possible we shall have to\nrevise our ideas on several points. We have, of course, cabled to\nSantiago, and are expecting a reply from there any minute. In all\npossibility, everything will then be perfectly clear and\nstraightforward. On the other hand, if your suggestion of blackmail is\ntrue, Madame Daubreuil ought to be able to give us valuable\ninformation.\"\n\nPoirot interjected a remark:\n\n\"M. Stonor, the English chauffeur, Masters, had he been long with M.\nRenauld?\"\n\n\"Over a year?\"\n\n\"Have you any idea whether he has ever been in South America?\"\n\n\"I'm quite sure he hasn't. Before coming to Mr. Renauld, he had been\nfor many years with some people in Gloucestershire whom I know well.\"\n\n\"In fact, you can answer for him as being above suspicion?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\nPoirot seemed somewhat crest-fallen.\n\nMeanwhile the magistrate had summoned Marchaud.\n\n\"My compliments to Madame Renauld, and I should be glad to speak to her\nfor a few minutes. Beg her not to disturb herself. I will wait upon her\nupstairs.\"\n\nMarchaud saluted and disappeared.\n\nWe waited some minutes, and then, to our surprise, the door opened, and\nMrs. Renauld, deathly pale in her heavy mourning, entered the room.\n\nM. Hautet brought forward a chair, uttering vigorous protestations, and\nshe thanked him with a smile. Stonor was holding one hand of hers in\nhis with an eloquent sympathy. Words evidently failed him. Mrs. Renauld\nturned to M. Hautet.\n\n\"You wished to ask me something, M. le juge.\"", "\"With your permission, madame. I understand your husband was a French\nCanadian by birth. Can you tell me anything of his youth, or\nupbringing?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"My husband was always very reticent about himself, monsieur. He came\nfrom the North West, I know, but I fancy that he had an unhappy\nchildhood, for he never cared to speak of that time. Our life was lived\nentirely in the present and the future.\"\n\n\"Was there any mystery in his past life?\"\n\nMrs. Renauld smiled a little, and shook her head.\n\n\"Nothing so romantic, I am sure, M. le juge.\"\n\nM. Hautet also smiled.\n\n\"True, we must not permit ourselves to get melodramatic. There is one\nthing more--\" he hesitated.\n\nStonor broke in impetuously:\n\n\"They've got an extraordinary idea into their heads Mrs. Renauld. They\nactually fancy that Mr. Renauld was carrying on an intrigue with a\nMadame Daubreuil who, it seems, lives next door.\"\n\nThe scarlet colour flamed into Mrs. Renauld's cheeks. She flung her\nhead up, then bit her lip, her face quivering. Stonor stood looking at\nher in astonishment, but M. Bex leaned forward and said gently: \"We\nregret to cause you pain, madame, but have you any reason to believe\nthat Madame Daubreuil was your husband's mistress?\"\n\nWith a sob of anguish, Mrs. Renauld buried her face in her hands. Her\nshoulders heaved convulsively. At last she lifted her head, and said\nbrokenly:\n\n\"She may have been.\"\n\nNever, in all my life, have I seen anything to equal the blank\namazement on Stonor's face. He was thoroughly taken aback.\n\nWhat the next development of the conversation would have been, I cannot\nsay, for at that moment the door was thrown violently open, and a tall\nyoung man strode into the room.\n\nJust for a moment I had the uncanny sensation that the dead man had\ncome to life again. Then I realized that this dark head was untouched\nwith grey, and that, in point of fact, it was a mere boy who now burst\nin among us with so little ceremony. He went straight to Mrs.", "Renauld\nwith an impetuosity that took no heed of the presence of others.\n\n\"Mother!\"\n\n\"Jack!\" With a cry she folded him in her arms. \"My dearest! But what\nbrings you here? You were to sail on the _Anzora___ from Cherbourg two\ndays ago?\" Then, suddenly recalling to herself the presence of others,\nshe turned with a certain dignity, \"My son, messieurs.\"\n\n\"Aha!\" said M. Hautet, acknowledging the young man's bow. \"So you did\nnot sail on the _Anzora?___\"\n\n\"No, monsieur. As I was about to explain, the _Anzora___ was detained\ntwenty-four hours through engine trouble. I should have sailed last\nnight instead of the night before, but, happening to buy an evening\npaper, I saw in it an account of the--the awful tragedy that had\nbefallen us--\" His voice broke and the tears came into his eyes. \"My\npoor father--my poor, poor, father.\"\n\nStaring at him like one in a dream, Mrs. Renauld repeated: \"So you did\nnot sail?\" And then, with a gesture of infinite weariness, she murmured\nas though to herself, \"After all, it does not matter--now.\"\n\n\"Sit down, M. Renauld, I beg of you,\" said M. Hautet, indicating a\nchair. \"My sympathy for you is profound. It must have been a terrible\nshock to you to learn the news as you did. However, it is most\nfortunate that you were prevented from sailing. I am in hopes that you\nmay be able to give us just the information we need to clear up this\nmystery.\"\n\n\"I am at your disposal, M. le juge. Ask me any questions you please.\"\n\n\"To begin with, I understand that this journey was being undertaken at\nyour father's request?\"\n\n\"Quite so, M. le juge. I received a telegram bidding me to proceed\nwithout delay to Buenos Ayres, and from thence via the Andes to\nValparaiso and on to Santiago.\"\n\n\"Ah. And the object of this journey?\"\n\n\"I have no idea, M. le juge.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"No. See, here is the telegram.\"\n\nThe magistrate took it and read it aloud.\n\n\" 'Proceed immediately Cherbourg embark _Anzora___ sailing tonight\nBuenos Ayres. Ultimate destination Santiago.", "Further instructions will\nawait you Buenos Ayres. Do not fail. Matter is of utmost importance.\nRenauld.' And there had been no previous correspondence on the matter?\"\n\nJack Renauld shook his head.\n\n\"That is the only intimation of any kind. I knew, of course, that my\nfather, having lived so long out there, had necessarily many interests\nin South America. But he had never mooted any suggestion of sending me\nout.\"\n\n\"You have, of course, been a good deal in South America, M. Renauld?\"\n\n\"I was there as a child. But I was educated in England, and spent most\nof my holidays in that country, so I really know far less of South\nAmerica than might be supposed. You see, the war broke out when I was\nseventeen.\"\n\n\"You served in the English Flying Corps, did you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, M. le juge.\"\n\nM. Hautet nodded his head, and proceeded with his inquiries along the,\nby now, well-known lines. In response, Jack Renauld declared definitely\nthat he knew nothing of any enmity his father might have incurred in\nthe city of Santiago, or elsewhere in the South American continent,\nthat he had noticed no change in his father's manner of late, and that\nhe had never heard him refer to a secret. He had regarded the mission\nto South America as connected with business interests.\n\nAs M. Hautet paused for a minute, the quiet voice of Giraud broke in.\n\n\"I should like to put a few questions on my own account, M. le juge.\"\n\n\"By all means, M. Giraud, if you wish,\" said the magistrate coldly.\n\nGiraud edged his chair a little nearer to the table.\n\n\"Were you on good terms with your father, M. Renauld?\"\n\n\"Certainly I was,\" returned the lad haughtily.\n\n\"You assert that positively?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"No little disputes, eh?\"\n\nJack shrugged his shoulders. \"Every one may have a difference of\nopinion now and then.\"\n\n\"Quite so, quite so. But if any one were to assert that you had a\nviolent quarrel with your father on the eve of your departure for\nParis, that person, without doubt, would be lying?\"", "I could not but admire the ingenuity of Giraud. His boast \"I know\neverything\" had been no idle one. Jack Renauld was clearly disconcerted\nby the question.\n\n\"We--we did have an argument,\" he admitted.\n\n\"Ah, an argument! In the course of that argument did you use this\nphrase: 'When you are dead, I can do as I please?' \"\n\n\"I may have done,\" muttered the other. \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"In response to that, did your father say: 'But I am not dead yet!' To\nwhich you responded: 'I wish you were!' \"\n\nThe boy made no answer. His hands fiddled nervously with the things on\nthe table in front of him.\n\n\"I must request an answer, please, M. Renauld,\" said Giraud sharply.\n\nWith an angry exclamation, the boy swept a heavy paper-knife on to the\nfloor.\n\n\"What does it matter? You might as well know. Yes, I did quarrel with\nmy father. I dare say I said all those things--I was so angry I cannot\neven remember what I said! I was furious--I could almost have killed him\nat that moment--there, make the most of that!\" He leant back in his\nchair, flushed and defiant.\n\nGiraud smiled, then, moving his chair back a little, said:\n\n\"That is all. You would, without doubt, prefer to continue the\ninterrogatory, M. le juge.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, exactly,\" said M. Hautet. \"And what was the subject of your\nquarrel?\"\n\n\"I decline to state.\"\n\nM. Hautet sat up in his chair.\n\n\"M. Renauld, it is not permitted to trifle with the law!\" he thundered.\n\"What was the subject of the quarrel?\"\n\nYoung Renauld remained silent, his boyish face sullen and overcast. But\nanother voice spoke, imperturbable and calm, the voice of Hercule\nPoirot.\n\n\"I will inform you, if you like, M. le juge.\"\n\n\"You know?\"\n\n\"Certainly I know. The subject of the quarrel was Mademoiselle Marthe\nDaubreuil.\"\n\nRenauld sprang round, startled. The magistrate leaned forward.\n\n\"Is this so, monsieur.\"\n\nJack Renauld bowed his head.\n\n\"Yes,\" he admitted. \"I love Mademoiselle Daubreuil, and I wish to marry\nher. When I informed my father of the fact, he flew at once into a\nviolent rage.", "Naturally I could not stand hearing the girl I loved\ninsulted, and I, too, lost my temper.\"\n\nM. Hautet looked across at Mrs. Renauld.\n\n\"You were aware of this--attachment, madame.\"\n\n\"I feared it,\" she replied simply.\n\n\"Mother,\" cried the boy. \"You too! Marthe is as good as she is\nbeautiful. What can you have against her?\"\n\n\"I have nothing against Mademoiselle Daubreuil in any way. But I should\nprefer you to marry an Englishwoman, or if a Frenchwoman not one who\nhas a mother of doubtful antecedents!\"\n\nHer rancour against the older woman showed plainly in her voice, and I\ncould well understand that it must have been a bitter blow to her when\nher only son showed signs of falling in love with the daughter of her\nrival.\n\nMrs. Renauld continued, addressing the magistrate:\n\n\"I ought, perhaps, to have spoken to my husband on the subject, but I\nhoped that it was only a boy and girl flirtation which would blow over\nall the quicker if no notice was taken of it. I blame myself now for my\nsilence, but my husband, as I told you, had seemed so anxious and\ncare-worn, different altogether from his normal self, that I was\nchiefly concerned not to give him any additional worry.\"\n\nM. Hautet nodded.\n\n\"When you informed your father of your intentions towards Mademoiselle\nDaubreuil,\" he resumed, \"he was surprised?\"\n\n\"He seemed completely taken aback. Then he ordered me peremptorily to\ndismiss any such idea from my mind. He would never give his consent to\nsuch a marriage. Nettled, I demanded what he had against Mademoiselle\nDaubreuil. To that he could give no satisfactory reply, but spoke in\nslighting terms of the mystery surrounding the lives of the mother and\ndaughter. I answered that I was marrying Marthe, and not her\nantecedents, but he shouted me down with a peremptory refusal to\ndiscuss the matter in any way. The whole thing must be given up. The\ninjustice and high-handedness of it all maddened me--especially since he\nhimself always seemed to go out of his way to be attentive to the\nDaubreuils and was always suggesting that they should be asked to the\nhouse.", "I lost my head, and we quarrelled in earnest. My father reminded\nme that I was entirely dependent on him, and it must have been in\nanswer to that that I made the remark about doing as I pleased after\nhis death--\"\n\nPoirot interrupted with a quick question.\n\n\"You were aware, then, of the terms of your father's will?\"\n\n\"I knew that he had left half his fortune to me, the other half in\ntrust for my mother to come to me at her death,\" replied the lad.\n\n\"Proceed with your story,\" said the magistrate.\n\n\"After that we shouted at each other in sheer rage, until I suddenly\nrealized that I was in danger of missing my train to Paris. I had to\nrun for the station, still in a white heat of fury. However, once well\naway, I calmed down. I wrote to Marthe, telling her what had happened,\nand her reply soothed me still further. She pointed out to me that we\nhad only to be steadfast, and any opposition was bound to give way at\nlast. Our affection for each other must be tried and proved, and when\nmy parents realized that it was no light infatuation on my part they\nwould doubtless relent towards us. Of course, to her, I had not dwelt\non my father's principal objection to the match. I soon saw that I\nshould do my cause no good by violence. My father wrote me several\nletters to Paris, affectionate in tone, and which did not refer to our\ndisagreement or its cause, and I replied in the same strain.\"\n\n\"You can produce those letters, eh?\" said Giraud.\n\n\"I did not keep them.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" said the detective.\n\nRenauld looked at him for a moment, but the magistrate was continuing\nhis questions.\n\n\"To pass to another matter, are you acquainted with the name of Duveen,\nM. Renauld?\"\n\n\"Duveen?\" said Jack. \"Duveen?\" He leant forward, and slowly picked up\nthe paper-knife he had swept from the table. As he lifted his head, his\neyes met the watching ones of Giraud. \"Duveen? No, I can't say I am.\"", "\"Will you read this letter, M. Renauld? And tell me if you have any\nidea as to who the person was who addressed it to your father?\"\n\nJack Renauld took the letter, and read it through, the colour mounting\nin his face as he did so.\n\n\"Addressed to my father?\" The emotion and indignation in his tones were\nevident.\n\n\"Yes. We found it in the pocket of his coat.\"\n\n\"Does--\" He hesitated, throwing the merest fraction of a glance towards\nhis mother. The magistrate understood.\n\n\"As yet--no. Can you give us any clue as to the writer?\"\n\n\"I have no idea whatsoever.\"\n\nM. Hautet sighed.\n\n\"A most mysterious case. Ah, well, I suppose we can now rule out the\nletter altogether. What do you think, M. Giraud? It does not seem to\nlead us anywhere.\"\n\n\"It certainly does not,\" agreed the detective with emphasis.\n\n\"And yet,\" sighed the magistrate, \"it promised at the beginning to be\nsuch a beautiful and simple case!\" He caught Mrs. Renauld's eye, and\nblushed in immediate confusion. \"Ah, yes,\" he coughed, turning over the\npapers on the table. \"Let me see, where were we? Oh, the weapon. I fear\nthis may give you pain, M. Renauld. I understand it was a present from\nyou to your mother. Very sad--very distressing--\"\n\nJack Renauld leaned forward. His face, which had flushed during the\nperusal of the letter, was now deadly white.\n\n\"Do you mean--that it was with an aeroplane wire paper cutter that my\nfather was--was killed? But it's impossible! A little thing like that!\"\n\n\"Alas, M. Renauld, it is only too true! An ideal little tool, I fear.\nSharp and easy to handle.\"\n\n\"Where is it? Can I see it? Is it still in the--the body?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, it had been removed. You would like to see it? To make sure?\nIt would be as well, perhaps, though madame has already identified it.\nStill--M. Bex, might I trouble you?\"\n\n\"Certainly, M. le juge. I will fetch it immediately.\"\n\n\"Would it not be better to take M. Renauld to the shed?\"", "suggested\nGiraud smoothly. \"Without doubt he would wish to see his father's\nbody.\"\n\nThe boy made a shivering gesture of negation, and the magistrate,\nalways disposed to cross Giraud whenever possible, replied.\n\n\"But no--not at present. M. Bex will be so kind as to bring it to us\nhere.\"\n\nThe commissary left the room. Stonor crossed to Jack, and wrung him by\nthe hand. Poirot had risen and was adjusting a pair of candlesticks\nthat struck his trained eye as being a shade askew. The magistrate was\nreading the mysterious love-letter through a last time, clinging\ndesperately to his first theory of jealousy and a stab in the back.\n\nSuddenly the door burst open and the commissary rushed in.\n\n\"M. le juge! M. le juge!\"\n\n\"But yes. What is it?\"\n\n\"The dagger! It is gone!\"\n\n\"_Comment___--gone?\"\n\n\"Vanished. Disappeared. The glass jar that contained it is empty!\"\n\n\"What?\" I cried. \"Impossible. Why, only this morning I saw--\" The words\ndied on my tongue.\n\nBut the attention of the entire room was diverted to me.\n\n\"What is that you say?\" cried the commissary. \"This morning?\"\n\n\"I saw it there this morning,\" I said slowly. \"About an hour and a half\nago, to be accurate.\"\n\n\"You went to the shed, then? How did you get the key?\"\n\n\"I asked the _sergent de ville___ for it.\"\n\n\"And you went there? Why?\"\n\nI hesitated, but in the end I decided that the only thing to do was to\nmake a clean breast of it.\n\n\"M. le juge,\" I said. \"I have committed a grave fault, for which I must\ncrave your indulgence.\"\n\n\"_Eh bien!___ Proceed, monsieur.\"\n\n\"The fact of the matter is,\" I said, wishing myself anywhere else than\nwhere I was, \"that I met a young lady, an acquaintance of mine. She\ndisplayed a great desire to see everything that was to be seen, and\nI--well, in short, I took the key to show her the body.\"\n\n\"Ah, _par exemple___,\" cried the magistrate indignantly. \"But it is a\ngrave fault you have committed there, Captain Hastings. It is\naltogether most irregular.", "You should not have permitted yourself this\nfolly.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I said meekly. \"Nothing that you can say could be too severe,\nM. le juge.\"\n\n\"You did not invite this lady to come here?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. I met her quite by accident. She is an English lady who\nhappens to be staying in Merlinville, though I was not aware of that\nuntil my unexpected meeting with her.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said the magistrate, softening. \"It was most irregular,\nbut the lady is without doubt young and beautiful, _n'est-ce pas?___\nWhat it is to be young! _O jeunesse, jeunesse!___\" And he sighed\nsentimentally.\n\nBut the commissary, less romantic, and more practical, took up the\ntale:\n\n\"But did not you reclose and lock the door when you departed.\"\n\n\"That's just it,\" I said slowly. \"That's what I blame myself for so\nterribly. My friend was upset at the sight. She nearly fainted. I got\nher some brandy and water, and afterwards insisted on accompanying her\nback to town. In the excitement, I forgot to relock the door. I only\ndid so when I got back to the Villa.\"\n\n\"Then for twenty minutes at least--\" said the commissary slowly. He\nstopped.\n\n\"Exactly,\" I said.\n\n\"Twenty minutes,\" mused the commissary.\n\n\"It is deplorable,\" said M. Hautet, his sternness of manner returning.\n\"Without precedent.\"\n\nSuddenly another voice spoke.\n\n\"You find it deplorable, M. le juge?\" asked Giraud.\n\n\"Certainly I do.\"\n\n\"_Eh bien!___ I find it admirable,\" said the other imperturbably.\n\nThis unexpected ally quite bewildered me.\n\n\"Admirable, M. Giraud?\" asked the magistrate, studying him cautiously\nout of the corner of his eye.\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"And why?\"\n\n\"Because we know now that the assassin, or an accomplice of the\nassassin, has been near the Villa only an hour ago. It will be strange\nif, with that knowledge, we do not shortly lay hands upon him.\" There\nwas a note of menace in his voice. He continued: \"He risked a good deal\nto gain possession of that dagger. Perhaps he feared that finger-prints\nmight be discovered on it.\"\n\nPoirot turned to Bex.\n\n\"You said there were none?\"", "Giraud shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Perhaps he could not be sure.\"\n\nPoirot looked at him.\n\n\"You are wrong, M. Giraud. The assassin wore gloves. So he must have\nbeen sure.\"\n\n\"I do not say it was the assassin himself. It may have been an\naccomplice who was not aware of that fact.\"\n\n\"_Ils sont mal renseignes, les accomplices!___\" muttered Poirot, but he\nsaid no more.\n\nThe magistrate's clerk was gathering up the papers on the table. M.\nHautet addressed us:\n\n\"Our work here is finished. Perhaps, M. Renauld, you will listen whilst\nyour evidence is read over to you. I have purposely kept all the\nproceedings as informal as possible. I have been called original in my\nmethods, but I maintain that there is much to be said for originality.\nThe case is now in the clever hands of the renowned M. Giraud. He will\nwithout doubt distinguish himself. Indeed, I wonder that he has not\nalready laid his hands upon the murderers! Madame, again let me assure\nyou of my heart-felt sympathy. Messieurs, I wish you all good day.\"\nAnd, accompanied by his clerk and the commissary, he took his\ndeparture.\n\nPoirot tugged out that large turnip of a watch of his, and observed the\ntime.\n\n\"Let us return to the hotel for lunch, my friend,\" he said. \"And you\nshall recount to me in full the indiscretions of this morning. No one\nis observing us. We need make no adieux.\"\n\nWe went quietly out of the room. The examining magistrate had just\ndriven off in his car. I was going down the steps when Poirot's voice\narrested me:\n\n\"One little moment, my friend.\" Dexterously, he whipped out his yard\nmeasure, and proceeded, quite solemnly, to measure an overcoat hanging\nin the hall from the collar to the hem. I had not seen it hanging there\nbefore, and guessed that it belonged to either Mr. Stonor, or Jack\nRenauld.\n\nThen, with a little satisfied grunt, Poirot returned the measure to his\npocket, and followed me out into the open air.\n\n\"Why did you measure that overcoat?\" I asked, with some curiosity, as\nwe walked down the hot white road at a leisurely pace.", "\"_Parbleu!___ to see how long it was,\" replied my friend imperturbably.\n\nI was vexed. Poirot's incurable habit of making a mystery out of\nnothing never failed to irritate me. I relapsed into silence, and\nfollowed a train of thought of my own. Although I had not noticed them\nspecially at the time, certain words Mrs. Renauld had addressed to her\nson now recurred to me, fraught with a new significance. \"So you did\nnot sail?\" she had said, and then had added: \"_After all, it does not\nmatter--now.___\"\n\nWhat had she meant by that? The words were enigmatical--significant. Was\nit possible that she knew more than we supposed? She had denied all\nknowledge of the mysterious mission with which her husband was to have\nentrusted his son. But was she really less ignorant than she pretended?\nCould she enlighten us if she chose, and was her silence part of a\ncarefully thought out and preconceived plan?\n\nThe more I thought about it, the more I was convinced that I was right.\nMrs. Renauld knew more than she chose to tell. In her surprise at\nseeing her son, she had momentarily betrayed herself. I felt convinced\nthat she knew, if not the assassins, at least the motive for the\nassassination. But some very powerful considerations must keep her\nsilent.\n\n\"You think profoundly, my friend,\" remarked Poirot, breaking in upon my\nreflections. \"What is it that intrigues you so?\"\n\nI told him, sure of my ground, though feeling expectant that he would\nridicule my suspicions. But to my surprise he nodded thoughtfully.\n\n\"You are quite right, Hastings. From the beginning I have been sure\nthat she was keeping something back. At first I suspected her, if not\nof inspiring, at least of conniving at the crime.\"\n\n\"You suspected _her?___\" I cried.\n\n\"But certainly! She benefits enormously--in fact, by this new will, she\nis the only person to benefit. So, from the start, she was singled out\nfor attention. You may have noticed that I took an early opportunity of\nexamining her wrists. I wished to see whether there was any possibility\nthat she had gagged and bound herself.", "_Eh bien___, I saw at once that\nthere was no fake, the cords had actually been drawn so tight as to cut\ninto the flesh. That ruled out the possibility of her having committed\nthe crime single-handed. But it was still possible for her to have\nconnived at it, or to have been the instigator with an accomplice.\nMoreover, the story, as she told it, was singularly familiar to me--the\nmasked men that she could not recognize, the mention of 'the secret'--I\nhad heard, or read, all these things before. Another little detail\nconfirmed my belief that she was not speaking the truth. _The wrist\nwatch, Hastings, the wrist watch!___\"\n\nAgain that wrist watch! Poirot was eyeing me curiously.\n\n\"You see, _mon ami?___ You comprehend?\"\n\n\"No,\" I replied with some ill humour. \"I neither see nor comprehend.\nYou make all these confounded mysteries, and it's useless asking you to\nexplain. You always like keeping everything up your sleeve to the last\nminute.\"\n\n\"Do not enrage yourself, my friend,\" said Poirot with a smile. \"I will\nexplain if you wish. But not a word to Giraud, _c'est entendu?___ He\ntreats me as an old one of no importance! _We shall see!___ In common\nfairness I gave him a hint. If he does not choose to act upon it, that\nis his own look out.\"\n\nI assured Poirot that he could rely upon my discretion.\n\n\"_C'est bien!___ Let us then employ our little grey cells. Tell me, my\nfriend, at what time, according to you, did the tragedy take place?\"\n\n\"Why, at two o'clock or thereabouts,\" I said, astonished. \"You\nremember, Mrs. Renauld told us that she heard the clock strike while\nthe men were in the room.\"\n\n\"Exactly, and on the strength of that, you, the examining magistrate,\nBex, and every one else, accept the time without further question. But\nI, Hercule Poirot, say that Madame Renauld lied. _The crime took place\nat least two hours earlier.___\"\n\n\"But the doctors--\"\n\n\"They declared, after examination of the body, that death had taken\nplace between ten and seven hours previously.", "_Mon ami___, for some\nreason, it was imperative that the crime should seem to have taken\nplace later than it actually did. You have read of a smashed watch or\nclock recording the exact hour of a crime? So that the time should not\nrest on Mrs. Renauld's testimony alone, some one moved on the hands of\nthat wrist watch to two o'clock, and then dashed it violently to the\nground. But, as is often the case, they defeated their own object. The\nglass was smashed, but the mechanism of the watch was uninjured. It was\na most disastrous manoeuvre on their part, for it at once drew my\nattention to two points--first, that Madame Renauld was lying: secondly,\nthat there must be some vital reason for the postponement of the time.\"\n\n\"But what reason could there be?\"\n\n\"Ah, that is the question! There we have the whole mystery. As yet, I\ncannot explain it. There is only one idea that presents itself to me as\nhaving a possible connection.\"\n\n\"And that is?\"\n\n\"The last train left Merlinville at seventeen minutes past twelve.\"\n\nI followed it out slowly.\n\n\"So that, the crime apparently taking place some two hours later, any\none leaving by that train would have an unimpeachable alibi!\"\n\n\"Perfect, Hastings! You have it!\"\n\nI sprang up.\n\n\"But we must inquire at the station. Surely they cannot have failed to\nnotice two foreigners who left by that train! We must go there at\nonce!\"\n\n\"You think so, Hastings?\"\n\n\"Of course. Let us go there now.\"\n\nPoirot restrained my ardour with a light touch upon the arm.\n\n\"Go by all means if you wish, _mon ami___--but if you go, I should not\nask for particulars of two foreigners.\"\n\nI stared, and he said rather impatiently:\n\n\"La, la, you do not believe all that rigmarole, do you? The masked men\nand all the rest of _cette histoire-la!___\"\n\nHis words took me so much aback that I hardly knew how to respond. He\nwent on serenely:\n\n\"You heard me say to Giraud, did you not, that all the details of this\ncrime were familiar to me?", "_Eh bien___, that presupposes one of two\nthings, either the brain that planned the first crime also planned this\none, or else an account read of a _cause celebre___ unconsciously\nremained in our assassin's memory and prompted the details. I shall be\nable to pronounce definitely on that after--\" he broke off.\n\nI was revolving sundry matters in my mind.\n\n\"But Mr. Renauld's letter? It distinctly mentions a secret and\nSantiago?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly there was a secret in M. Renauld's life--there can be no\ndoubt of that. On the other hand, the word Santiago, to my mind, is a\nred herring, dragged continually across the track to put us off the\nscent. It is possible that it was used in the same way on M. Renauld,\nto keep him from directing his suspicions into a quarter nearer at\nhand. Oh, be assured, Hastings, the danger that threatened him was not\nin Santiago, it was near at hand, in France.\"\n\nHe spoke so gravely, and with such assurance, that I could not fail to\nbe convinced. But I essayed one final objection:\n\n\"And the match and cigarette end found near the body? What of them.\"\n\nA light of pure enjoyment lit up Poirot's face.\n\n\"Planted! Deliberately planted there for Giraud or one of his tribe to\nfind! Ah, he is smart, Giraud, he can do his tricks! So can a good\nretriever dog. He comes in so pleased with himself. For hours he has\ncrawled on his stomach. 'See what I have found,' he says. And then\nagain to me: 'What do you see here?' Me, I answer, with profound and\ndeep truth, 'Nothing.' And Giraud, the great Giraud, he laughs, he\nthinks to himself, 'Oh, that he is imbecile, this old one!' _But we\nshall see. ...___\"\n\nBut my mind had reverted to the main facts.\n\n\"Then all this story of the masked men--?\"\n\n\"Is false.\"\n\n\"What really happened?\"\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"One person could tell us--Madame Renauld. But she will not speak.\nThreats and entreaties would not move her. A remarkable woman that,\nHastings. I recognized as soon as I saw her that I had to deal with a\nwoman of unusual character.", "At first, as I told you, I was inclined to\nsuspect her of being concerned in the crime. Afterwards I altered my\nopinion.\"\n\n\"What made you do that?\"\n\n\"Her spontaneous and genuine grief at the sight of her husband's body.\nI could swear that the agony in that cry of hers was genuine.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said thoughtfully, \"one cannot mistake these things.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, my friend--one can always be mistaken. Regard a\ngreat actress, does not her acting of grief carry you away and impress\nyou with its reality? No, however strong my own impression and belief,\nI needed other evidence before I allowed myself to be satisfied. The\ngreat criminal can be a great actor. I base my certainty in this case,\nnot upon my own impression, but upon the undeniable fact that Mrs.\nRenauld actually fainted. I turned up her eyelids and felt her pulse.\nThere was no deception--the swoon was genuine. Therefore I was satisfied\nthat her anguish was real and not assumed. Besides, a small additional\npoint not without interest, it was unnecessary for Mrs. Renauld to\nexhibit unrestrained grief. She had had one paroxysm on learning of her\nhusband's death, and there would be no need for her to simulate another\nsuch a violent one on beholding his body. No, Mrs. Renauld was not her\nhusband's murderess. But why has she lied? She lied about the wrist\nwatch, she lied about the masked men--she lied about a third thing. Tell\nme, Hastings, what is your explanation of the open door?\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, rather embarrassed, \"I suppose it was an oversight.\nThey forgot to shut it.\"\n\nPoirot shook his head, and sighed.\n\n\"That is the explanation of Giraud. It does not satisfy me. There is a\nmeaning behind that open door which for a moment I cannot fathom.\"\n\n\"I have an idea,\" I cried suddenly.\n\n\"_A la bonne heure!___ Let us hear it.\"\n\n\"Listen. We are agreed that Mrs. Renauld's story is a fabrication. Is\nit not possible, then, that Mr. Renauld left the house to keep an\nappointment--possibly with the murderer--leaving the front door open for\nhis return.", "But he did not return, and the next morning he is found,\nstabbed in the back.\"\n\n\"An admirable theory, Hastings, but for two facts which you have\ncharacteristically overlooked. In the first place, who gagged and bound\nMadame Renauld? And why on earth should they return to the house to do\nso? In the second place, no man on earth would go out to keep an\nappointment wearing his underclothes and an overcoat. There are\ncircumstances in which a man might wear pajamas and an overcoat--but the\nother, never!\"\n\n\"True,\" I said, rather crest-fallen.\n\n\"No,\" continued Poirot, \"we must look elsewhere for a solution of the\nopen door mystery. One thing I am fairly sure of--they did not leave\nthrough the door. They left by the window.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"But there were no footmarks in the flower bed underneath.\"\n\n\"No--_and there ought to have been.___ Listen, Hastings. The gardener,\nAuguste, as you heard him say, planted both those beds the preceding\nafternoon. In the one there are plentiful impressions of his big\nhobnailed boots--in the other, _none!___ You see? Some one had passed\nthat way, some one who, to obliterate their footprints, smoothed over\nthe surface of the bed with a rake.\"\n\n\"Where did they get a rake?\"\n\n\"Where they got the spade and the gardening gloves,\" said Poirot\nimpatiently. \"There is no difficulty about that.\"\n\n\"What makes you think that they left that way, though? Surely it is\nmore probable that they entered by the window, and left by the door.\"\n\n\"That is possible of course. Yet I have a strong idea that they left by\nthe window.\"\n\n\"I think you are wrong.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, _mon ami___.\"\n\nI mused, thinking over the new field of conjecture that Poirot's\ndeductions had opened up to me. I recalled my wonder at his cryptic\nallusions to the flower bed and the wrist watch. His remarks had seemed\nso meaningless at the moment and now, for the first time, I realized\nhow remarkably, from a few slight incidents, he had unravelled much of\nthe mystery that surrounded the case.", "I paid a belated homage to my\nfriend. As though he read my thoughts, he nodded sagely.\n\n\"Method, you comprehend! Method! Arrange your facts. Arrange your\nideas. And if some little fact will not fit in--do not reject it but\nconsider it closely. Though its significance escapes you, be sure that\nit is significant.\"\n\n\"In the meantime,\" I said, considering, \"although we know a great deal\nmore than we did, we are no nearer to solving the mystery of who killed\nMr. Renauld.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Poirot cheerfully. \"In fact we are a great deal further\noff.\"\n\nThe fact seemed to afford him such peculiar satisfaction that I gazed\nat him in wonder. He met my eye and smiled.\n\n\"But yes, it is better so. Before, there was at all events a clear\ntheory as to how and by whose hands he met his death. Now that is all\ngone. We are in darkness. A hundred conflicting points confuse and\nworry us. That is well. That is excellent. Out of confusion comes forth\norder. But if you find order to start with, if a crime seems simple and\nabove-board, _eh bien, mefiez vous!___ It is, how do you say\nit?--_cooked!___ The great criminal is simple--but very few criminals\n_are___ great. In trying to cover up their tracks, they invariably\nbetray themselves. Ah, _mon ami___, I would that some day I could meet\na really great criminal--one who commits his crime, and then--does\nnothing! Even I, Hercule Poirot, might fail to catch such a one.\"\n\nBut I had not followed his words. A light had burst upon me.\n\n\"Poirot! Mrs. Renauld! I see it now. She must be shielding somebody.\"\n\nFrom the quietness with which Poirot received my remark, I could see\nthat the idea had already occurred to him.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said thoughtfully. \"Shielding some one--or screening some one.\nOne of the two.\"\n\nI saw very little difference between the two words, but I developed my\ntheme with a good deal of earnestness. Poirot maintained a strictly\nnon-committal attitude, repeating:\n\n\"It may be--yes, it may be.", "But as yet I do not know! There is something\nvery deep underneath all this. You will see. Something very deep.\"\n\nThen, as we entered our hotel, he enjoined silence on me with a\ngesture.\n\nWe lunched with an excellent appetite. I understood well enough that\nPoirot did not wish to discuss the tragedy where we could so easily be\noverheard. But, as is usual when one topic fills the mind to the\nexclusion of everything else, no other subject of interest seemed to\npresent itself. For a while we ate in silence, and then Poirot observed\nmaliciously:\n\n\"_Eh bien!___ And your indiscretions! You recount them not?\"\n\nI felt myself blushing.\n\n\"Oh, you mean this morning?\" I endeavoured to adopt a tone of absolute\nnonchalance.\n\nBut I was no match for Poirot. In a very few minutes he had extracted\nthe whole story from me, his eyes twinkling as he did so.\n\n\"_Tiens!___ A story of the most romantic. What is her name, this\ncharming young lady?\"\n\nI had to confess that I did not know.\n\n\"Still more romantic! The first _rencontre___ in the train from Paris,\nthe second here. Journeys end in lovers' meetings, is not that the\nsaying?\"\n\n\"Don't be an ass, Poirot.\"\n\n\"Yesterday it was Mademoiselle Daubreuil, today it is\nMademoiselle--Cinderella! Decidedly you have the heart of a Turk,\nHastings! You should establish a harem!\"\n\n\"It's all very well to rag me. Mademoiselle Daubreuil is a very\nbeautiful girl, and I do admire her immensely--I don't mind admitting\nit. The other's nothing--don't suppose I shall ever see her again. She\nwas quite amusing to talk to just for a railway journey, but she's not\nthe kind of girl I should ever get keen on.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Well--it sounds snobbish perhaps--but she's not a lady, not in any sense\nof the word.\"\n\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully. There was less raillery in his voice as he\nasked:\n\n\"You believe, then, in birth and breeding?\"\n\n\"I may be old-fashioned, but I certainly don't believe in marrying out\nof one's class. It never answers.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, _mon ami___.", "Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, it\nis as you say. But there is always the hundredth time! Still, that does\nnot arise, as you do not propose to see the lady again.\"\n\nHis last words were almost a question, and I was aware of the sharpness\nwith which he darted a glance at me. And before my eyes, writ large in\nletters of fire, I saw the words \"Hotel du Phare,\" and I heard again\nher voice saying \"Come and look me up\" and my own answering with\n_empressement___: \"I will.\"\n\nWell, what of it? I had meant to go at the time. But since then, I had\nhad time to reflect. I did not like the girl. Thinking it over in cold\nblood, I came definitely to the conclusion that I disliked her\nintensely. I had got hauled over the coals for foolishly gratifying her\nmorbid curiosity, and I had not the least wish to see her again.\n\nI answered Poirot lightly enough.\n\n\"She asked me to look her up, but of course I shan't.\"\n\n\"Why 'of course'?\"\n\n\"Well--I don't want to.\"\n\n\"I see.\" He studied me attentively for some minutes. \"Yes. I see very\nwell. And you are wise. Stick to what you have said.\"\n\n\"That seems to be your invariable advice,\" I remarked, rather piqued.\n\n\"Ah, my friend, have faith in Papa Poirot. Some day, if you permit, I\nwill arrange you a marriage of great suitability.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said laughing, \"but the prospect leaves me cold.\"\n\nPoirot sighed and shook his head.\n\n\"_Les Anglais!___\" he murmured. \"No method--absolutely none whatever.\nThey leave all to chance!\" He frowned, and altered the position of the\nsalt cellar.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Cinderella is staying at the Hotel d'Angleterre you told\nme, did you not?\"\n\n\"No. Hotel du Phare.\"\n\n\"True, I forgot.\"\n\nA moment's misgiving shot across my mind. Surely I had never mentioned\nany hotel to Poirot. I looked across at him, and felt reassured. He was\ncutting his bread into neat little squares, completely absorbed in his\ntask. He must have fancied I had told him where the girl was staying.", "We had coffee outside facing the sea. Poirot smoked one of his tiny\ncigarettes, and then drew his watch from his pocket.\n\n\"The train to Paris leaves at 2:25,\" he observed. \"I should be\nstarting.\"\n\n\"Paris?\" I cried.\n\n\"That is what I said, _mon ami___.\"\n\n\"You are going to Paris? But why?\"\n\nHe replied very seriously.\n\n\"To look for the murderer of M. Renauld.\"\n\n\"You think he is in Paris?\"\n\n\"I am quite certain that he is not. Nevertheless, it is there that I\nmust look for him. You do not understand, but I will explain it all to\nyou in good time. Believe me, this journey to Paris is necessary. I\nshall not be away long. In all probability I shall return tomorrow. I\ndo not propose that you should accompany me. Remain here and keep an\neye on Giraud. Also cultivate the society of M. Renauld _fils___. And\nthirdly, if you wish, endeavour to cut him out with Mademoiselle\nMarthe. But I fear you will not have great success.\"\n\nI did not quite relish the last remark.\n\n\"That reminds me,\" I said. \"I meant to ask you how you knew about those\ntwo?\"\n\n\"_Mon ami___--I know human nature. Throw together a boy young Renauld\nand a beautiful girl like Mademoiselle Marthe, and the result is almost\ninevitable. Then, the quarrel! It was money or a woman and, remembering\nLeonie's description of the lad's anger, I decided on the latter. So I\nmade my guess--and I was right.\"\n\n\"And that was why you warned me against setting my heart on the lady?\nYou already suspected that she loved young Renauld?\"\n\nPoirot smiled.\n\n\"At any rate--_I saw that she had anxious eyes.___ That is how always\nthink of Mademoiselle Daubreuil _as the girl with the anxious\neyes. ...___\"\n\nHis voice was so grave that it impressed me uncomfortably.\n\n\"What do you mean by that, Poirot?\"\n\n\"I fancy, my friend, that we shall see before very long. But I must\nstart.\"\n\n\"You've oceans of time.\"\n\n\"Perhaps--perhaps. But I like plenty of leisure at the station. I do not\nwish to rush, to hurry, to excite myself.\"", "\"At all events,\" I said, rising, \"I will come and see you off.\"\n\n\"You will do nothing of the sort. I forbid it.\"\n\nHe was so peremptory that I stared at him in surprise. He nodded\nemphatically.\n\n\"I mean it, _mon ami___. Au revoir! You permit that I embrace you? Ah,\nno, I forget that it is not the English custom. Une poignee de main,\nalors.\"\n\nI felt rather at a loose end after Poirot had left me. I strolled down\nthe beach, and watched the bathers, without feeling energetic enough to\njoin them. I rather fancied that Cinderella might be disporting herself\namongst them in some wonderful costume, but I saw no signs of her. I\nstrolled aimlessly along the sands towards the further end of the town.\nIt occurred to me that, after all, it would only be decent feeling on\nmy part to inquire after the girl. And it would save trouble in the\nend. The matter would then be finished with. There would be no need for\nme to trouble about her any further. But, if I did not go at all, she\nmight quite possibly come and look me up at the Villa. And that would\nbe annoying in every way. Decidedly it would be better to pay a short\ncall, in the course of which I could make it quite clear that I could\ndo nothing further for her in my capacity of showman.\n\nAccordingly I left the beach, and walked inland. I soon found the Hotel\ndu Phare, a very unpretentious building. It was annoying in the extreme\nnot to know the lady's name and, to save my dignity, I decided to\nstroll inside and look around. Probably I should find her in the\nlounge. Merlinville was a small place, you left your hotel to go to the\nbeach, and you left the beach to return to the hotel. There were no\nother attractions. There was a Casino being built, but it was not yet\ncompleted.\n\nI had walked the length of the beach without seeing her, therefore she\nmust be in the hotel.", "I went in. Several people were sitting in the\ntiny lounge, but my quarry was not amongst them. I looked into some\nother rooms, but there was no sign of her. I waited for some time, till\nmy impatience got the better of me. I took the concierge aside, and\nslipped five francs into his hand.\n\n\"I wish to see a lady who is staying here. A young English lady, small\nand dark. I am not sure of her name.\"\n\nThe man shook his head, and seemed to be suppressing a grin.\n\n\"There is no such lady as you describe staying here.\"\n\n\"She is American possibly,\" I suggested. These fellows are so stupid.\n\nBut the man continued to shake his head.\n\n\"No, monsieur. There are only six or seven English and American ladies\naltogether, and they are all much older than the lady you are seeking.\nIt is not here that you will find her, monsieur.\"\n\nHe was so positive that I felt doubts.\n\n\"But the lady told me she was staying here.\"\n\n\"Monsieur must have made a mistake--or it is more likely the lady did,\nsince there has been another gentleman here inquiring for her.\"\n\n\"What is that you say?\" I cried, surprised.\n\n\"But yes, monsieur. A gentleman who described her just as you have\ndone.\"\n\n\"What was he like?\"\n\n\"He was a small gentleman, well dressed, very neat, very spotless, the\nmoustache very stiff, the head of a peculiar shape, and the eyes\ngreen.\"\n\nPoirot! So that was why he refused to let me accompany him to the\nstation. The impertinence of it! I would thank him not to meddle in my\nconcerns. Did he fancy I needed a nurse to look after me? Thanking the\nman, I departed, somewhat at a loss, and still much incensed with my\nmeddlesome friend. I regretted that he was, for the moment, out of\nreach. I should have enjoyed telling him what I thought of his\nunwarranted interference. Had I not distinctly told him that I had no\nintention of seeing the girl? Decidedly, one's friends can be too\nzealous!", "But where was the lady? I set aside my wrath, and tried to puzzle it\nout. Evidently, through inadvertence, she had named the wrong hotel.\nThen another thought struck me. Was it inadvertence? Or had she\ndeliberately withheld her name and given me the wrong address? The more\nI thought about it, the more I felt convinced that this last surmise of\nmine was right. For some reason or other she did not wish to let the\nacquaintance ripen into friendship. And though half an hour earlier\nthis had been precisely my own view, I did not enjoy having the tables\nturned upon me. The whole affair was profoundly unsatisfactory, and I\nwent up to the Villa Genevieve in a condition of distinct ill humour. I\ndid not go to the house, but went up the path to the little bench by\nthe shed, and sat there moodily enough.\n\nI was distracted from my thoughts by the sound of voices close at hand.\nIn a second or two I realized that they came, not from the garden I was\nin, but from the adjoining garden of the Villa Marguerite, and that\nthey were approaching rapidly. A girl's voice was speaking, a voice\nthat I recognized as that of the beautiful Marthe.\n\n\"_Cheri___,\" she was saying, \"is it really true? Are all our troubles\nover.\"\n\n\"You know it, Marthe,\" Jack Renauld replied. \"Nothing can part us now,\nbeloved. The last obstacle to our union is removed. Nothing can take\nyou from me.\"\n\n\"Nothing?\" the girl murmured. \"Oh, Jack, Jack--I am afraid.\"\n\nI had moved to depart, realizing that I was quite unintentionally\neavesdropping. As I rose to my feet, I caught sight of them through a\ngap in the hedge. They stood together facing me, the man's arm round\nthe girl, his eyes looking into hers. They were a splendid looking\ncouple, the dark, well-knit boy, and the fair young goddess. They\nseemed made for each other as they stood there, happy in spite of the\nterrible tragedy that overshadowed their young lives.\n\nBut the girl's face was troubled, and Jack Renauld seemed to recognize\nit, as he held her closer to him and asked:\n\n\"But what are you afraid of, darling?", "What is there to fear--now?\"\n\nAnd then I saw the look in her eyes, the look Poirot had spoken of, as\nshe murmured, so that I almost guessed at the words.\n\n\"I am afraid--for _you___. ...\"\n\nI did not hear young Renauld's answer, for my attention was distracted\nby an unusual appearance a little further down the hedge. There\nappeared to be a brown bush there, which seemed odd, to say the least\nof it, so early in the summer. I stepped along to investigate, but, at\nmy advance, the brown bush withdrew itself precipitately, and faced me\nwith a finger to its lips. It was Giraud.\n\nEnjoining caution, he led the way round the shed until we were out of\near-shot.\n\n\"What were you doing there?\" I asked.\n\n\"Exactly what you were doing--listening.\"\n\n\"But I was not there on purpose!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Giraud. \"I was.\"\n\nAs always, I admired the man whilst disliking him. He looked me up and\ndown with a sort of contemptuous disfavour.\n\n\"You didn't help matters by butting in. I might have heard something\nuseful in a minute. What have you done with your old fossil?\"\n\n\"M. Poirot has gone to Paris,\" I replied coldly.\n\n\"And I can tell you, M. Giraud, that he is anything but an old fossil.\nHe has solved many cases that have completely baffled the English\npolice.\"\n\n\"Bah! The English police!\" Giraud snapped his fingers disdainfully.\n\"They must be on a level with our examining magistrates. So he has gone\nto Paris, has he? Well, a good thing. The longer he stays there, the\nbetter. But what does he think he will find there?\"\n\nI thought I read in the question a tinge of uneasiness. I drew myself\nup.\n\n\"That I am not at liberty to say,\" I said quietly.\n\nGiraud subjected me to a piercing stare.\n\n\"He has probably enough sense not to tell _you___,\" he remarked rudely.\n\"Good afternoon. I'm busy.\"\n\nAnd with that, he turned on his heel, and left me without ceremony.\nMatters seemed at a standstill at the Villa Genevieve. Giraud evidently\ndid not desire my company and, from what I had seen, it seemed fairly\ncertain that Jack Renauld did not either.", "I went back to the town, had an enjoyable bath and returned to the\nhotel. I turned in early, wondering whether the following day would\nbring forth anything of interest.\n\nI was wholly unprepared for what it did bring forth. I was eating my\npetit dejeuner in the dining-room, when the waiter, who had been\ntalking to some one outside, came back in obvious excitement. He\nhesitated for a minute, fidgeting with his napkin, and then burst out.\n\n\"Monsieur will pardon me, but he is connected, is he not, with the\naffair at the Villa Genevieve?'\n\n\"Yes,\" I said eagerly. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Monsieur has not heard the news, though?\"\n\n\"What news?\"\n\n\"That there has been another murder there last night!\"\n\n\"_What?___\"\n\nLeaving my breakfast, I caught up my hat and ran as fast as I could.\nAnother murder--and Poirot away! What fatality. But who had been\nmurdered?\n\nI dashed in at the gate. A group of the servants was in the drive,\ntalking and gesticulating. I caught hold of Francoise.\n\n\"What has happened?\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur! monsieur! Another death! It is terrible. There is a\ncurse upon the house. But yes, I say it, a curse! They should send for\nM. le cure to bring some holy water. Never will I sleep another night\nunder that roof. It might be my turn, who knows?\"\n\nShe crossed herself.\n\n\"Yes,\" I cried, \"but who has been killed?\"\n\n\"Do I know--me? A man--a stranger. They found him up there--in the\nshed--not a hundred yards from where they found poor Monsieur. And that\nis not all. He is stabbed--stabbed to the heart _with the same\ndagger!___\"\n\nWaiting for no more, I turned and ran up the path to the shed. The two\nmen on guard there stood aside to let me pass and, filled with\nexcitement, I entered.\n\nThe light was dim, the place was a mere rough wooden erection to keep\nold pots and tools in. I had entered impetuously, but on the threshold\nI checked myself, fascinated by the spectacle before me.\n\nGiraud was on his hands and knees, a pocket torch in his hand with\nwhich he was examining every inch of the ground.", "He looked up with a\nfrown at my entrance, then his face relaxed a little in a sort of\ngood-humoured contempt.\n\n\"Ah, _c'est l'Anglais!___ Enter then. Let us see what you can make of\nthis affair.\"\n\nRather stung by his tone, I stooped my head, and passed in.\n\n\"There he is,\" said Giraud, flashing his torch to the far corner.\n\nI stepped across.\n\nThe dead man lay straight upon his back. He was of medium height,\nswarthy of complexion, and possibly about fifty years of age. He was\nneatly dressed in a dark blue suit, well cut and probably made by an\nexpensive tailor, but not new. His face was terribly convulsed, and on\nhis left side, just over the heart, the hilt of a dagger stood up,\nblack and shining. I recognized it. It was the same dagger I had seen\nreposing in the glass jar the preceding morning!\n\n\"I'm expecting the doctor any minute,\" explained Giraud. \"Although we\nhardly need him. There's no doubt what the man died of. He was stabbed\nto the heart, and death must have been pretty well instantaneous.\"\n\n\"When was it done? Last night?\"\n\nGiraud shook his head.\n\n\"Hardly. I don't lay down the law on medical evidence, but the man's\nbeen dead well over twelve hours. When do you say you last saw that\ndagger?\"\n\n\"About ten o'clock yesterday morning.\"\n\n\"Then I should be inclined to fix the crime as being done not long\nafter that.\"\n\n\"But people were passing and repassing this shed continually.\"\n\nGiraud laughed disagreeably.\n\n\"You progress to a marvel! Who told you he was killed in this shed?\"\n\n\"Well--\" I felt flustered. \"I--I assumed it.\"\n\n\"Oh, what a fine detective! Look at him, _mon petit___--does a man\nstabbed to the heart fall like that--neatly with his feet together, and\nhis arms to his side? No. Again does a man lie down on his back and\npermit himself to be stabbed without raising a hand to defend himself?\nIt is absurd, is it not? But see here--and here--\" He flashed the torch\nalong the ground.", "I saw curious irregular marks in the soft dirt. \"He\nwas dragged here after he was dead. Half dragged, half carried by two\npeople. Their tracks do not show on the hard ground outside, and here\nthey have been careful to obliterate them--but one of the two was a\nwoman, my young friend.\"\n\n\"A woman?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But if the tracks are obliterated, how do you know?\"\n\n\"Because, blurred as they are, the prints of the woman's shoe are\nunmistakable. Also, by _this___--\" And, leaning forward, he drew\nsomething from the handle of the dagger and held it up for me to see.\nIt was a woman's long black hair--similar to the one Poirot had taken\nfrom the arm-chair in the library.\n\nWith a slightly ironic smile he wound it round the dagger again.\n\n\"We will leave things as they are as much as possible,\" he explained.\n\"It pleases the examining magistrate. _Eh bien___, do you notice\nanything else?\"\n\nI was forced to shake my head.\n\n\"Look at his hands.\"\n\nI did. The nails were broken and discoloured, and the skin was hard. It\nhardly enlightened me as much as I should have liked it to have done. I\nlooked up at Giraud.\n\n\"They are not the hands of a gentleman,\" he said, answering my look.\n\"On the contrary his clothes are those of a well-to-do man. That is\ncurious, is it not?\"\n\n\"Very curious,\" I agreed.\n\n\"And none of his clothing is marked. What do we learn from that? This\nman was trying to pass himself off as other than he was. He was\nmasquerading. Why? Did he fear something? Was he trying to escape by\ndisguising himself? As yet we do not know, but one thing we do know--he\nwas as anxious to conceal his identity as we are to discover it.\"\n\nHe looked down at the body again.\n\n\"As before there are no finger-prints on the handle of the dagger. The\nmurderer again wore gloves.\"\n\n\"You think, then, that the murderer was the same in both cases?\" I\nasked eagerly.\n\nGiraud became inscrutable.", "\"Never mind what I think. We shall see. Marchaud!\"\n\nThe _sergent de ville___ appeared at the doorway.\n\n\"Monsieur?\"\n\n\"Why is Madame Renauld not here? I sent for her a quarter of an hour\nago?\"\n\n\"She is coming up the path now, monsieur, and her son with her.\"\n\n\"Good. I only want one at a time, though.\"\n\nMarchaud saluted and disappeared again. A moment later he reappeared\nwith Mrs. Renauld.\n\n\"Here is Madame.\"\n\nGiraud came forward with a curt bow.\n\n\"This way, madame.\" He led her across, and then, standing suddenly\naside. \"Here is the man. Do you know him?\"\n\nAnd as he spoke, his eyes, gimlet-like, bored into her face, seeking to\nread her mind, noting every indication of her manner.\n\nBut Mrs. Renauld remained perfectly calm--too calm, I felt. She looked\ndown at the corpse almost without interest, certainly without any sign\nof agitation or recognition.\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"I have never seen him in my life. He is quite a\nstranger to me.\"\n\n\"You are sure?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.\"\n\n\"You do not recognize in him one of your assailants, for instance?\"\n\n\"No,\" she seemed to hesitate, as though struck by the idea. \"No, I do\nnot think so. Of course they wore beards--false ones the examining\nmagistrate thought, but still--no.\" Now she seemed to make her mind up\ndefinitely. \"I am sure neither of the two was this man.\"\n\n\"Very well, madame. That is all, then.\"\n\nShe stepped out with head erect, the sun flashing on the silver threads\nin her hair. Jack Renauld succeeded her. He, too, failed to identify\nthe man, in a completely natural manner.\n\nGiraud merely grunted. Whether he was pleased or chagrined I could not\ntell. He merely called to Marchaud:\n\n\"You have got the other there?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Bring her in then.\"\n\n\"The other\" was Madame Daubreuil. She came indignantly, protesting with\nvehemence.\n\n\"I object, monsieur! This is an outrage! What have I to do with all\nthis?\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said Giraud brutally, \"I am investigating not one murder, but\ntwo murders! For all I know you may have committed them both.\"", "\"How dare you?\" she cried. \"How dare you insult me by such a wild\naccusation! It is infamous.\"\n\n\"Infamous, is it? What about this?\" Stooping, he again detached the\nhair, and held it up. \"Do you see this, madame?\" He advanced towards\nher. \"You permit that I see whether it matches?\"\n\nWith a cry she started backwards, white to the lips.\n\n\"It is false--I swear it. I know nothing of the crime--of either crime.\nAny one who says I do lies! Ah! _mon Dieu___, what shall I do?\"\n\n\"Calm yourself, madame,\" said Giraud coldly. \"No one has accused you as\nyet. But you will do well to answer my questions without more ado.\"\n\n\"Anything you wish, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Look at the dead man. Have you ever seen him before?\"\n\nDrawing nearer, a little of the colour creeping back to her face,\nMadame Daubreuil looked down at the victim with a certain amount of\ninterest and curiosity. Then she shook her head.\n\n\"I do not know him.\"\n\nIt seemed impossible to doubt her, the words came so naturally. Giraud\ndismissed her with a nod of the head. \"You are letting her go?\" I asked\nin a low voice. \"Is that wise? Surely that black hair is from her\nhead.\"\n\n\"I do not need teaching my business,\" said Giraud dryly. \"She is under\nsurveillance. I have no wish to arrest her as yet.\"\n\nThen, frowning, he gazed down at the body.\n\n\"Should you say that was a Spanish type at all?\" he asked suddenly.\n\nI considered the face carefully.\n\n\"No,\" I said at last. \"I should put him down as a Frenchman most\ndecidedly.\"\n\nGiraud gave a grunt of dissatisfaction.\n\n\"Same here.\"\n\nHe stood there for a moment, then with an imperative gesture he waved\nme aside, and once more, on hands and knees, he continued his search of\nthe floor of the shed. He was marvellous. Nothing escaped him. Inch by\ninch he went over the floor, turning over pots, examining old sacks. He\npounced on a bundle by the door, but it proved to be only a ragged coat\nand trousers, and he flung it down again with a snarl.", "Two pairs of old\ngloves interested him, but in the end he shook his head and laid them\naside. Then he went back to the pots, methodically turning them over\none by one. In the end, he rose to his feet, and shook his head\nthoughtfully. He seemed baffled and perplexed. I think he had forgotten\nmy presence.\n\nBut, at that moment, a stir and bustle was heard outside, and our old\nfriend, the examining magistrate, accompanied by his clerk and M. Bex,\nwith the doctor behind him, came bustling in.\n\n\"But this is extraordinary, Mr. Giraud,\" cried M. Hautet. \"Another\ncrime! Ah, we have not got to the bottom of this case. There is some\ndeep mystery here. But who is the victim this time?\"\n\n\"That is just what nobody can tell us, M. le juge. He has not been\nidentified.\"\n\n\"Where is the body?\" asked the doctor.\n\nGiraud moved aside a little.\n\n\"There in the corner. He has been stabbed to the heart, as you see. And\nwith the dagger that was stolen yesterday morning. I fancy that the\nmurder followed hard upon the theft--but that is for you to say. You can\nhandle the dagger freely--there are no finger-prints on it.\"\n\nThe doctor knelt down by the dead man, and Giraud turned to the\nexamining magistrate.\n\n\"A pretty little problem, is it not? But I shall solve it.\"\n\n\"And so no one can identify him,\" mused the magistrate. \"Could it\npossibly be one of the assassins? They may have fallen out among\nthemselves.\"\n\nGiraud shook his head.\n\n\"The man is a Frenchman--I would take my oath of that--\"\n\nBut at that moment they were interrupted by the doctor who was sitting\nback on his heels with a perplexed expression.\n\n\"You say he was killed yesterday morning?\"\n\n\"I fix it by the theft of the dagger,\" explained Giraud. \"He may, of\ncourse, have been killed later in the day.\"\n\n\"Later in the day? Fiddlesticks! This man has been dead at least\nforty-eight hours, and probably longer.\"\n\nWe stared at each other in blank amazement.", "The doctor's words were so surprising that we were all momentarily\ntaken aback. Here was a man stabbed with a dagger which we knew to have\nbeen stolen only twenty-four hours previously, and yet Dr. Durand\nasserted positively that he had been dead at least forty-eight hours!\nThe whole thing was fantastic to the last extreme.\n\nWe were still recovering from the surprise of the doctor's\nannouncement, when a telegram was brought to me. It had been sent up\nfrom the hotel to the Villa. I tore it open. It was from Poirot, and\nannounced his return by the train arriving at Merlinville at 12:28.\n\nI looked at my watch and saw that I had just time to get comfortably to\nthe station and meet him there. I felt that it was of the utmost\nimportance that he should know at once of the new and startling\ndevelopments in the case.\n\nEvidently, I reflected, Poirot had had no difficulty in finding what he\nwanted in Paris. The quickness of his return proved that. Very few\nhours had sufficed. I wondered how he would take the exciting news I\nhad to impart.\n\nThe train was some minutes late, and I strolled aimlessly up and down\nthe platform, until it occurred to me that I might pass the time by\nasking a few questions as to who had left Merlinville by the last train\non the evening of the tragedy.\n\nI approached the chief porter, an intelligent looking man, and had\nlittle difficulty in persuading him to enter upon the subject. It was a\ndisgrace to the Police, he hotly affirmed, that such brigands of\nassassins should be allowed to go about unpunished. I hinted that there\nwas some possibility they might have left by the midnight train, but he\nnegatived the idea decidedly. He would have noticed two foreigners--he\nwas sure of it. Only about twenty people had left by the train, and he\ncould not have failed to observe them.\n\nI do not know what put the idea into my head--possibly it was the deep\nanxiety underlying Marthe Daubreuil's tones--but I asked suddenly:\n\n\"Young M. Renauld--he did not leave by that train, did he?\"", "\"Ah, no, monsieur. To arrive and start off again within half an hour,\nit would not be amusing, that!\"\n\nI stared at the man, the significance of his words almost escaping me.\nThen I saw. ...\n\n\"You mean,\" I said, my heart beating a little, \"that M. Jack Renauld\narrived at Merlinville that evening?\"\n\n\"But yes, monsieur. By the last train arriving the other way, the\n11:40.\"\n\nMy brain whirled. That, then, was the reason of Marthe's poignant\nanxiety. Jack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the\ncrime! But why had he not said so? Why, on the contrary, had he led us\nto believe that he had remained in Cherbourg? Remembering his frank\nboyish countenance, I could hardly bring myself to believe that he had\nany connection with the crime. Yet why this silence on his part about\nso vital a matter? One thing was certain, Marthe had known all along.\nHence her anxiety, and her eager questioning of Poirot to know whether\nany one were suspected.\n\nMy cogitations were interrupted by the arrival of the train, and in\nanother moment I was greeting Poirot. The little man was radiant. He\nbeamed and vociferated and, forgetting my English reluctance, embraced\nme warmly on the platform.\n\n\"_Mon cher ami___, I have succeeded--but succeeded to a marvel!\"\n\n\"Indeed? I'm delighted to hear it. Have you heard the latest here?\"\n\n\"How would you that I should hear anything? There have been some\ndevelopments, eh? The brave Giraud, he has made an arrest? Or even\narrests perhaps? Ah, but I will make him look foolish, that one! But\nwhere are you taking me, my friend? Do we not go to the hotel? It is\nnecessary that I attend to my moustaches--they are deplorably limp from\nthe heat of travelling. Also, without doubt, there is dust on my coat.\nAnd my tie, that I must rearrange.\"\n\nI cut short his remonstrances.\n\n\"My dear Poirot--never mind all that. We must go to the Villa at once.\n_There has been another murder!___\"\n\nI have frequently been disappointed when fancying that I was giving\nnews of importance to my friend.", "Either he has known it already or he\nhas dismissed it as irrelevant to the main issue--and in the latter case\nevents have usually proved him justified. But this time I could not\ncomplain of missing my effect. Never have I seen a man so\nflabbergasted. His jaw dropped. All the jauntiness went out of his\nbearing. He stared at me open-mouthed.\n\n\"What is that you say? Another murder? Ah, then, I am all wrong. I have\nfailed. Giraud may mock himself at me--he will have reason!\"\n\n\"You did not expect it, then?\"\n\n\"I? Not the least in the world. It demolishes my theory--it ruins\neverything--it--ah, no!\" He stopped dead, thumping himself on the chest.\n\"It is impossible. I _cannot___ be wrong! The facts, taken methodically\nand in their proper order admit of only one explanation. I must be\nright! I _am___ right!\"\n\n\"But then--\"\n\nHe interrupted me.\n\n\"Wait, my friend. I must be right, therefore this new murder is\nimpossible unless--unless--oh, wait, I implore you. Say no word--\"\n\nHe was silent for a moment or two, then, resuming his normal manner, he\nsaid in a quiet assured voice: \"The victim is a man of middle-age. His\nbody was found in the locked shed near the scene of the crime and had\nbeen dead at least forty-eight hours. And it is most probable that he\nwas stabbed in a similar manner to M. Renauld, though not necessarily\nin the back.\"\n\nIt was my turn to gape--and gape I did. In all my knowledge of Poirot he\nhad never done anything so amazing as this. And, almost inevitably, a\ndoubt crossed my mind.\n\n\"Poirot,\" I cried, \"you're pulling my leg. You've heard all about it\nalready.\"\n\nHe turned his earnest gaze upon me reproachfully.\n\n\"Would I do such a thing? I assure you that I have heard nothing\nwhatsoever. Did you not observe the shock your news was to me?\"\n\n\"But how on earth could you know all that?\"\n\n\"I was right then? But I knew it. The little grey cells, my friend, the\nlittle grey cells!", "They told me. Thus, and in no other way, could there\nhave been a second death. Now tell me all. If we go round to the left\nhere, we can take a short cut across the golf links which will bring us\nto the back of the Villa Genevieve much more quickly.\"\n\nAs we walked, taking the way he had indicated, I recounted all I knew.\nPoirot listened attentively.\n\n\"The dagger was in the wound, you say? That is curious. You are sure it\nwas the same one?\"\n\n\"Absolutely certain. That's what make it so impossible.\"\n\n\"Nothing is impossible. There may have been two daggers.\"\n\nI raised my eyebrows.\n\n\"Surely that is in the highest degree unlikely? It would be a most\nextraordinary coincidence.\"\n\n\"You speak as usual, without reflection, Hastings. In some cases two\nidentical weapons _would___ be highly improbable. But not here. This\nparticular weapon was a war souvenir which was made to Jack Renauld's\norders. It is really highly unlikely, when you come to think of it,\nthat he should have had only one made. Very probably he would have\nanother for his own use.\"\n\n\"But nobody has mentioned such a thing,\" I objected.\n\nA hint of the lecturer crept into Poirot's tone. \"My friend, in working\nupon a case, one does not take into account only the things that are\n'mentioned.' There is no reason to mention many things which may be\nimportant. Equally, there is often an excellent reason for _not___\nmentioning them. You can take your choice of the two motives.\"\n\nI was silent, impressed in spite of myself. Another few minutes brought\nus to the famous shed. We found all our friends there and, after an\ninterchange of polite amenities, Poirot began his task.\n\nHaving watched Giraud at work, I was keenly interested. Poirot bestowed\nbut a cursory glance on the surroundings. The only thing he examined\nwas the ragged coat and trousers by the door. A disdainful smile rose\nto Giraud's lips, and, as though noting it, Poirot flung the bundle\ndown again.\n\n\"Old clothes of the gardener's?\" he queried.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Giraud.", "Poirot knelt down by the body. His fingers were rapid but methodical.\nHe examined the texture of the clothes, and satisfied himself that\nthere were no marks on them. The boots he subjected to special care,\nalso the dirty and broken finger-nails. Whilst examining the latter he\nthrew a quick question at Giraud.\n\n\"You saw these?\"\n\n\"Yes, I saw them,\" replied the other. His face remained inscrutable.\n\nSuddenly Poirot stiffened.\n\n\"Dr. Durand!\"\n\n\"Yes?\" The doctor came forward.\n\n\"There is foam on the lips. You observed it?\"\n\n\"I didn't notice it, I must admit.\"\n\n\"But you observe it now?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly.\"\n\nPoirot again shot a question at Giraud.\n\n\"You noticed it without doubt?\"\n\nThe other did not reply. Poirot proceeded. The dagger had been\nwithdrawn from the wound. It reposed in a glass jar by the side of the\nbody. Poirot examined it, then he studied the wound closely. When he\nlooked up, his eyes were excited, and shone with the green light I knew\nso well.\n\n\"It is a strange wound, this! It has not bled. There is no stain on the\nclothes. The blade of the dagger is slightly discoloured, that is all.\nWhat do you think, M. le docteur?\"\n\n\"I can only say that it is most abnormal.\"\n\n\"It is not abnormal at all. It is most simple. The man was stabbed\n_after he was dead___.\" And, stilling the clamour of voices that arose\nwith a wave of his hand, Poirot turned to Giraud and added, \"M. Giraud\nagrees with me, do you not, monsieur?\"\n\nWhatever Giraud's real belief, he accepted the position without moving\na muscle. Calmly and almost scornfully he replied:\n\n\"Certainly I agree.\"\n\nThe murmur of surprise and interest broke out again.\n\n\"But what an idea!\" cried M. Hautet. \"To stab a man after he is dead!\nBarbaric! Unheard of! Some unappeasable hate, perhaps.\"\n\n\"No, M. le juge,\" said Poirot. \"I should fancy it was done quite\ncold-bloodedly--to create an impression.\"\n\n\"What impression?\"\n\n\"The impression it nearly did create,\" returned Poirot oracularly.\n\nM. Bex had been thinking.\n\n\"How, then, was the man killed?\"", "\"He was not killed. He died. He died, M. le juge, if I am not much\nmistaken, of an epileptic fit!\"\n\nThis statement of Poirot's again aroused considerable excitement. Dr.\nDurand knelt down again, and made a searching examination. At last he\nrose to his feet.\n\n\"Well, M. le docteur?\"\n\n\"M. Poirot, I am inclined to believe that you are correct in your\nassertion. I was misled to begin with. The incontrovertible fact that\nthe man had been stabbed distracted my attention from any other\nindications.\"\n\nPoirot was the hero of the hour. The examining magistrate was profuse\nin compliments. Poirot responded gracefully, and then excused himself\non the pretext that neither he nor I had yet lunched, and that he\nwished to repair the ravages of the journey. As we were about to leave\nthe shed, Giraud approached us.\n\n\"One more thing, M. Poirot,\" he said, in his suave mocking voice. \"We\nfound this coiled round the handle of the dagger. A woman's hair.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Poirot. \"A woman's hair? What woman's, I wonder?\"\n\n\"I wonder also,\" said Giraud. Then, with a bow, he left us.\n\n\"He was insistent, the good Giraud,\" said Poirot thoughtfully, as we\nwalked towards the hotel. \"I wonder in what direction he hopes to\nmislead me? A woman's hair--h'm!\"\n\nWe lunched heartily, but I found Poirot somewhat distrait and\ninattentive. Afterwards we went up to our sitting-room and there I\nbegged him to tell me something of his mysterious journey to Paris.\n\n\"Willingly, my friend. I went to Paris to find _this___.\"\n\nHe took from his pocket a small faded newspaper cutting. It was the\nreproduction of a woman's photograph. He handed it to me. I uttered an\nexclamation.\n\n\"You recognize it, my friend?\"\n\nI nodded. Although the photo obviously dated from very many years back,\nand the hair was dressed in a different style, the likeness was\nunmistakable.\n\n\"Madame Daubreuil!\" I exclaimed.\n\nPoirot shook his head with a smile.\n\n\"Not quite correct, my friend. She did not call herself by that name in\nthose days. That is a picture of the notorious Madame Beroldy!\"", "Madame Beroldy! In a flash the whole thing came back to me. The murder\ntrial that had evoked such world-wide interest.\n\n\n_The Beroldy Case.___\n\nSome twenty years or so before the opening of the present story,\nMonsieur Arnold Beroldy, a native of Lyons, arrived in Paris\naccompanied by his pretty wife and their little daughter, a mere babe.\nMonsieur Beroldy was a junior partner in a firm of wine merchants, a\nstout middle-aged man, fond of the good things of life, devoted to his\ncharming wife, and altogether unremarkable in every way. The firm in\nwhich Monsieur Beroldy was a partner was a small one, and although\ndoing well, it did not yield a large income to the junior partner. The\nBeroldys had a small apartment and lived in a very modest fashion to\nbegin with.\n\nBut unremarkable though Monsieur Beroldy might be, his wife was\nplentifully gilded with the brush of Romance. Young and good looking,\nand gifted withal with a singular charm of manner, Madame Beroldy at\nonce created a stir in the quarter, especially when it began to be\nwhispered that some interesting mystery surrounded her birth. It was\nrumoured that she was the illegitimate daughter of a Russian Grand\nDuke. Others asserted that it was an Austrian Archduke, and that the\nunion was legal, though morganatic. But all stories agreed upon one\npoint, that Jeanne Beroldy was the centre of an interesting mystery.\nQuestioned by the curious, Madame Beroldy did not deny these rumours.\nOn the other hand she let it be clearly understood that, though her\n\"lips\" were \"sealed,\" all these stories had a foundation in fact. To\nintimate friends she unburdened herself further, spoke of political\nintrigues, of \"papers,\" of obscure dangers that threatened her. There\nwas also much talk of Crown jewels that were to be sold secretly, with\nherself acting as the go-between.\n\nAmongst the friends and acquaintances of the Beroldys was a young\nlawyer, Georges Conneau. It was soon evident that the fascinating\nJeanne had completely enslaved his heart. Madame Beroldy encouraged the\nyoung man in a discreet fashion, but being always careful to affirm her\ncomplete devotion to her middle-aged husband.", "Nevertheless, many\nspiteful persons did not hesitate to declare that young Conneau was her\nlover--and not the only one!\n\nWhen the Beroldys had been in Paris about three months, another\npersonage came upon the scene. This was Mr. Hiram P. Trapp, a native of\nthe United States, and extremely wealthy. Introduced to the charming\nand mysterious Madame Beroldy, he fell a prompt victim to her\nfascinations. His admiration was obvious, though strictly respectful.\n\nAbout this time, Madame Beroldy became more outspoken in her\nconfidences. To several friends, she declared herself greatly worried\non her husband's behalf. She explained that he had been drawn into\nseveral schemes of a political nature, and also referred to some\nimportant papers that had been entrusted to him for safekeeping and\nwhich concerned a \"secret\" of far reaching European importance. They\nhad been entrusted to his custody to throw pursuers off the track, but\nMadame Beroldy was nervous, having recognized several important members\nof the Revolutionary Circle in Paris.\n\nOn the 28th day of November, the blow fell. The woman who came daily to\nclean and cook for the Beroldys was surprised to find the door of the\napartment standing wide open. Hearing faint moans issuing from the\nbedroom, she went in. A terrible sight met her eyes. Madame Beroldy lay\non the floor, bound hand and foot, uttering feeble moans, having\nmanaged to free her mouth from a gag. On the bed was Monsieur Beroldy,\nlying in a pool of blood, with a knife driven through his heart.\n\nMadame Beroldy's story was clear enough. Suddenly awakened from sleep,\nshe had discerned two masked men bending over her. Stifling her cries,\nthey had bound and gagged her. They had then demanded of Monsieur\nBeroldy the famous \"secret.\"\n\nBut the intrepid wine merchant refused point-blank to accede to their\nrequest. Angered by his refusal, one of the men incontinently stabbed\nhim through the heart. With the dead man's keys, they had opened the\nsafe in the corner, and had carried away with them a mass of papers.\nBoth men were heavily bearded, and had worn masks, but Madame Beroldy\ndeclared positively that they were Russians.", "The affair created an immense sensation. It was referred to variously\nas \"the Nihilist Atrocity,\" \"Revolutionaries in Paris,\" and the\n\"Russian Mystery.\" Time went on, and the mysterious bearded men were\nnever traced. And then, just as public interest was beginning to die\ndown, a startling development occurred. Madame Beroldy was arrested and\ncharged with the murder of her husband.\n\nThe trial, when it came on, aroused widespread interest. The youth and\nbeauty of the accused, and her mysterious history, were sufficient to\nmake of it a _cause celebre___. People ranged themselves wildly for or\nagainst the prisoner. But her partisans received several severe checks\nto their enthusiasm. The romantic past of Madame Beroldy, her royal\nblood, and the mysterious intrigues in which she had her being were\nshown to be mere fantasies of the imagination.\n\nIt was proved beyond doubt that Jeanne Beroldy's parents were a highly\nrespectable and prosaic couple, fruit merchants, who lived on the\noutskirts of Lyons. The Russian Grand Duke, the court intrigues, and\nthe political schemes--all the stories current were traced back to--the\nlady herself! From her brain had emanated these ingenious myths, and\nshe was proved to have raised a considerable sum of money from various\ncredulous persons by her fiction of the \"Crown jewels\"--the jewels in\nquestion being found to be mere paste imitations. Remorselessly the\nwhole story of her life was laid bare. The motive for the murder was\nfound in Mr. Hiram P. Trapp. Mr. Trapp did his best, but relentlessly\nand agilely cross-questioned he was forced to admit that he loved the\nlady, and that, had she been free, he would have asked her to be his\nwife. The fact that the relations between them were admittedly platonic\nstrengthened the case against the accused. Debarred from becoming his\nmistress by the simple honourable nature of the man, Jeanne Beroldy had\nconceived the monstrous project of ridding herself of her elderly\nundistinguished husband, and becoming the wife of the rich American.\n\nThroughout, Madame Beroldy confronted her accusers with complete sang\nfroid and self possession. Her story never varied.", "She continued to\ndeclare strenuously that she was of royal birth, and that she had been\nsubstituted for the daughter of the fruit seller at an early age.\nAbsurd and completely unsubstantiated as these statements were, a great\nnumber of people believed implicitly in their truth.\n\nBut the prosecution was implacable. It denounced the masked \"Russians\"\nas a myth, and asserted that the crime had been committed by Madame\nBeroldy and her lover, Georges Conneau. A warrant was issued for the\narrest of the latter, but he had wisely disappeared. Evidence showed\nthat the bonds which secured Madame Beroldy were so loose that she\ncould easily have freed herself.\n\nAnd then, towards the close of the trial, a letter, posted in Paris,\nwas sent to the Public Prosecutor. It was from Georges Conneau and,\nwithout revealing his whereabouts, it contained a full confession of\nthe crime. He declared that he had indeed struck the fatal blow at\nMadame Beroldy's instigation. The crime had been planned between them.\nBelieving that her husband ill-treated her, and maddened by his own\npassion for her, a passion which he believed her to return, he had\nplanned the crime and struck the fatal blow that should free the woman\nhe loved from a hateful bondage. Now, for the first time, he learnt of\nMr. Hiram P. Trapp, and realized that the woman he loved had betrayed\nhim! Not for his sake did she wish to be free--but in order to marry the\nwealthy American. She had used him as a cat's-paw, and now, in his\njealous rage, he turned and denounced her, declaring that throughout he\nhad acted at her instigation.\n\nAnd then Madame Beroldy proved herself the remarkable woman she\nundoubtedly was. Without hesitation, she dropped her previous defence,\nand admitted that the \"Russians\" were a pure invention on her part. The\nreal murderer was Georges Conneau. Maddened by passion, he had\ncommitted the crime, vowing that if she did not keep silence he would\nenact a terrible vengeance from her. Terrified by his threats, she had\nconsented--also fearing it likely that if she told the truth she might\nbe accused of conniving at the crime.", "But she had steadfastly refused\nto have anything more to do with her husband's murderer, and it was in\nrevenge for this attitude on her part that he had written this letter\naccusing her. She swore solemnly that she had had nothing to do with\nthe planning of the crime, that she had awoke on that memorable night\nto find Georges Conneau standing over her, the blood-stained knife in\nhis hand.\n\nIt was a touch and go affair. Madame Beroldy's story was hardly\ncredible. But this woman, whose fairy tales of royal intrigues had been\nso easily accepted, had the supreme art of making herself believed. Her\naddress to the jury was a masterpiece. The tears streaming down her\nface, she spoke of her child, of her woman's honour--of her desire to\nkeep her reputation untarnished for the child's sake. She admitted\nthat, Georges Conneau having been her lover, she might perhaps be held\nmorally responsible for the crime--but, before God, nothing more! She\nknew that she had committed a grave fault in not denouncing Conneau to\nthe law, but she declared in a broken voice that that was a thing no\nwoman could have done. ... She had loved him! Could she let her hand be\nthe one to send him to the Guillotine? She had been guilty of much, but\nshe was innocent of the terrible crime imputed to her.\n\nHowever that may have been, her eloquence and personality won the day.\nMadame Beroldy, amidst a scene of unparalleled excitement, was\nacquitted. Despite the utmost endeavours of the police, Georges Conneau\nwas never traced. As for Madame Beroldy, nothing more was heard of her.\nTaking the child with her, she left Paris to begin a new life.\n\nI have set down the Beroldy case in full. Of course all the details did\nnot present themselves to my memory as I have recounted them here.\nNevertheless, I recalled the case fairly accurately. It had attracted a\ngreat deal of interest at the time, and had been fully reported by the\nEnglish papers, so that it did not need much effort of memory on my\npart to recollect the salient details.", "Just for the moment, in my excitement, it seemed to clear up the whole\nmatter. I admit that I am impulsive, and Poirot deplores my custom of\njumping to conclusions, but I think I had some excuse in this instance.\nThe remarkable way in which this discovery justified Poirot's point of\nview struck me at once.\n\n\"Poirot,\" I said, \"I congratulate you. I see everything now.\"\n\n\"If that is indeed the truth, _I___ congratulate _you___, _mon ami___.\nFor as a rule you are not famous for seeing--eh, is it not so?\"\n\nI felt a little annoyed.\n\n\"Come now, don't rub it in. You've been so confoundedly mysterious all\nalong with your hints and your insignificant details that any one might\nfail to see what you were driving at.\"\n\nPoirot lit one of his little cigarettes with his usual precision. Then\nhe looked up.\n\n\"And since you see everything now, _mon ami___, what exactly is it that\nyou see?\"\n\n\"Why, that it was Madame Daubreuil--Beroldy, who murdered Mr. Renauld.\nThe similarity of the two cases proves that beyond a doubt.\"\n\n\"Then you consider that Madame Beroldy was wrongly acquitted? That in\nactual fact she was guilty of connivance in her husband's murder?\"\n\nI opened my eyes wide.\n\n\"But of course! Don't you?\"\n\nPoirot walked to the end of the room, absentmindedly straightened a\nchair, and then said thoughtfully.\n\n\"Yes, that is my opinion. But there is no 'of course' about it, my\nfriend. Technically speaking, Madame Beroldy is innocent.\"\n\n\"Of that crime, perhaps. But not of this.\"\n\nPoirot sat down again, and regarded me, his thoughtful air more marked\nthan ever.\n\n\"So it is definitely your opinion, Hastings, that Madame Daubreuil\nmurdered M. Renauld?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nHe shot the question at me with such suddenness that I was taken aback.\n\n\"Why?\" I stammered. \"Why? Oh, because--\" I came to a stop.\n\nPoirot nodded his head at me.\n\n\"You see, you come to a stumbling-block at once. Why should Madame\nDaubreuil (I shall call her that for clearness sake) murder M. Renauld?\nWe can find no shadow of a motive.", "She does not benefit by his death;\nconsidered as either mistress or blackmailer she stands to lose. You\ncannot have a murder without a motive. The first crime was different,\nthere we had a rich lover waiting to step into her husband's shoes.\"\n\n\"Money is not the only motive for murder,\" I objected.\n\n\"True,\" agreed Poirot placidly. \"There are two others, the _crime\npassionnel___ is one. And there is the third rare motive, murder for an\nidea which implies some form of mental derangement on the part of the\nmurderer. Homicidal mania, and religious fanaticism belong to that\nclass. We can rule it out here.\"\n\n\"But what about the _crime passionnel?___ Can you rule that out? If\nMadame Daubreuil was Renauld's mistress, if she found that his\naffection was cooling, or if her jealousy was aroused in any way, might\nshe not have struck him down in a moment of anger?\"\n\nPoirot shook his head.\n\n\"If--I say _if___, you note--Madame Daubreuil was Renauld's mistress, he\nhad not had time to tire of her. And in any case you mistake her\ncharacter. She is a woman who can simulate great emotional stress. She\nis a magnificent actress. But, looked at dispassionately, her life\ndisproves her appearance. Throughout, if we examine it, she had been\ncold-blooded and calculating in her motives and actions. It was not to\nlink her life with that of her young lover that she connived at her\nhusband's murder. The rich American, for whom she probably did not care\na button, was her objective. If she committed a crime, she would always\ndo so for gain. Here there was no gain. Besides, how do you account for\nthe digging of the grave? That was a man's work.\"\n\n\"She might have had an accomplice,\" I suggested, unwilling to\nrelinquish my belief.\n\n\"I pass to another objection. You have spoken of the similarity between\nthe two crimes. Wherein does that lie, my friend?\"\n\nI stared at him in astonishment.\n\n\"Why, Poirot, it was you who remarked on that! The story of the masked\nmen, the 'secret,' the papers!\"", "Poirot smiled a little.\n\n\"Do not be so indignant, I beg of you. I repudiate nothing. The\nsimilarity of the two stories links the two cases together inevitably.\nBut reflect now on something very curious. It is not Madame Daubreuil\nwho tells us this tale--if it were all would indeed be plain sailing--it\nis Madame Renauld. Is she then in league with the other?\"\n\n\"I can't believe that,\" I said slowly. \"If it is so, she must be the\nmost consummate actress the world has ever known.\"\n\n\"Ta-ta-ta,\" said Poirot impatiently. \"Again you have the sentiment, and\nnot the logic! If it is necessary for a criminal to be a consummate\nactress, then by all means assume her to be one. But is it necessary? I\ndo not believe Madame Renauld to be in league with Madame Daubreuil for\nseveral reasons, some of which I have already enumerated to you. The\nothers are self-evident. Therefore, that possibility eliminated, we\ndraw very near to the truth which is, as always, very curious and\ninteresting.\"\n\n\"Poirot,\" I cried, \"what more do you know?\"\n\n\"_Mon ami___, you must make your own deductions. You have 'access to\nthe facts!' Concentrate your grey cells. Reason--not like Giraud--but\nlike Hercule Poirot.\"\n\n\"But are you _sure?___\"\n\n\"My friend, in many ways I have been an imbecile. But at last I see\nclearly.\"\n\n\"You know everything?\"\n\n\"I have discovered what M. Renauld sent for me to discover.\"\n\n\"And you know the murderer?\"\n\n\"I know one murderer.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"We talk a little at cross-purposes. There are here not one crime, but\ntwo. The first I have solved, the second--_eh bien___, I will confess, I\nam not sure!\"\n\n\"But, Poirot, I thought you said the man in the shed had died a natural\ndeath?\"\n\n\"Ta-ta-ta.\" Poirot made his favourite ejaculation of impatience. \"Still\nyou do not understand. One may have a crime without a murderer, but for\ntwo crimes it is essential to have two bodies.\"\n\nHis remark struck me as so peculiarly lacking in lucidity that I looked\nat him in some anxiety.", "But he appeared perfectly normal. Suddenly he\nrose and strolled to the window.\n\n\"Here he is,\" he observed.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"M. Jack Renauld. I sent a note up to the Villa to ask him to come\nhere.\"\n\nThat changed the course of my ideas, and I asked Poirot if he knew that\nJack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the crime. I had\nhoped to catch my astute little friend napping, but as usual, he was\nomniscient. He, too, had inquired at the station.\n\n\"And without doubt we are not original in the idea, Hastings. The\nexcellent Giraud, he also has probably made his inquiries.\"\n\n\"You don't think--\" I said, and then stopped. \"Ah, no, it would be too\nhorrible!\"\n\nPoirot looked inquiringly at me, but I said no more. It had just\noccurred to me that though there were seven women directly or\nindirectly connected with the case Mrs. Renauld, Madame Daubreuil and\nher daughter, the mysterious visitor, and the three servants--there was,\nwith the exception of old Auguste who could hardly count, only one\nman--Jack Renauld. _And a man must have dug a grave. ...___\n\nI had no time to develop further the appalling idea that had occurred\nto me, for Jack Renauld was ushered into the room.\n\nPoirot greeted him in a business-like manner.\n\n\"Take a seat, monsieur. I regret infinitely to derange you, but you\nwill perhaps understand that the atmosphere of the Villa is not too\ncongenial to me. M. Giraud and I do not see eye to eye about\neverything. His politeness to me has not been striking and you will\ncomprehend that I do not intend any little discoveries I may make to\nbenefit him in any way.\"\n\n\"Exactly, M. Poirot,\" said the lad. \"That fellow Giraud is an\nill-conditioned brute, and I'd be delighted to see some one score at\nhis expense.\"\n\n\"Then I may ask a little favour of you?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"I will ask you to go to the railway station and take a train to the\nnext station along the line, Abbalac. Ask there at the cloak-room\nwhether two foreigners deposited a valise there on the night of the\nmurder.", "It is a small station, and they are almost certain to remember.\nWill you do this?\"\n\n\"Of course I will,\" said the boy, mystified, though ready for the task.\n\n\"I and my friend, you comprehend, have business elsewhere,\" explained\nPoirot. \"There is a train in a quarter of an hour, and I will ask you\nnot to return to the Villa, as I have no wish for Giraud to get an\ninkling of your errand.\"\n\n\"Very well, I will go straight to the station.\"\n\nHe rose to his feet. Poirot's voice stopped him.\n\n\"One moment, M. Renauld, there is one little matter that puzzles me.\nWhy did you not mention to M. Hautet this morning that you were in\nMerlinville on the night of the crime?\"\n\nJack Renauld's face went crimson. With an effort he controlled himself.\n\n\"You have made a mistake. I was in Cherbourg, as I told the examining\nmagistrate this morning.\"\n\nPoirot looked at him, his eyes narrowed, cat-like, until they only\nshowed a gleam of green.\n\n\"Then it is a singular mistake that I have made there--for it is shared\nby the station staff. They say you arrived by the 11:40 train.\"\n\nFor a moment Jack Renauld hesitated, then he made up his mind.\n\n\"And if I did? I suppose you do not mean to accuse me of participating\nin my father's murder?\" He asked the question haughtily, his head\nthrown back.\n\n\"I should like an explanation of the reason that brought you here.\"\n\n\"That is simple enough. I came to see my fiancee, Mademoiselle\nDaubreuil. I was on the eve of a long voyage, uncertain as to when I\nshould return. I wished to see her before I went, to assure her of my\nunchanging devotion.\"\n\n\"And you did see her?\" Poirot's eyes never left the other's face.\n\nThere was an appreciable pause before Renauld replied. Then he said:\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And afterwards?\"\n\n\"I found I had missed the last train. I walked to St. Beauvais where I\nknocked up a garage and got a car to take me back to Cherbourg.\"\n\n\"St. Beauvais? That is fifteen kilometres.", "A long walk, M. Renauld.\"\n\n\"I--I felt like walking.\"\n\nPoirot bowed his head as a sign that he accepted the explanation. Jack\nRenauld took up his hat and cane and departed. In a trice Poirot jumped\nto his feet.\n\n\"Quick, Hastings. We will go after him.\"\n\nKeeping a discreet distance behind our quarry, we followed him through\nthe streets of Merlinville. But when Poirot saw that he took the\nturning to the station, he checked himself.\n\n\"All is well. He has taken the bait. He will go to Abbalac, and will\ninquire for the mythical valise left by the mythical foreigners. Yes,\n_mon ami___, all that was a little invention of my own.\"\n\n\"You wanted him out of the way!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Your penetration is amazing, Hastings! Now, if you please, we will go\nup to the Villa Genevieve.\"\n\n\"By the way, Poirot,\" I said, as we walked along the hot white road,\n\"I've got a bone to pick with you. I dare say you meant well, but\nreally it was no business of yours to go mouching round to the Hotel du\nPhare without letting me know.\"\n\nPoirot shot a quick sidelong glance at me.\n\n\"And how did you know I had been there?\" he inquired.\n\nMuch to my annoyance I felt the colour rising in my cheeks.\n\n\"I happened to look in in passing,\" I explained with as much dignity as\nI could muster.\n\nI rather feared Poirot's banter, but to my relief, and somewhat to my\nsurprise, he only shook his head with a rather unusual gravity.\n\n\"If I have offended your susceptibilities in any way, I demand pardon\nof you. You will understand better soon. But, believe me, I have\nstriven to concentrate all my energies on the case.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's all right,\" I said, mollified by the apology. \"I know it's\nonly that you have my interests at heart. But I can take care of myself\nall right.\"\n\nPoirot seemed to be about to say something further, but checked\nhimself.\n\nArrived at the Villa, Poirot led the way up to the shed where the\nsecond body had been discovered.", "He did not, however, go in, but paused\nby the bench which I have mentioned before as being set some few yards\naway from it. After contemplating it for a moment or two, he paced\ncarefully from it to the hedge which marked the boundary between the\nVilla Genevieve and the Villa Marguerite. Then he paced back again,\nnodding his head as he did so. Returning again to the hedge, he parted\nthe bushes with his hands.\n\n\"With good fortune,\" he remarked to me over his shoulder, \"Mademoiselle\nMarthe may find herself in the garden. I desire to speak to her and\nwould prefer not to call formally at the Villa Marguerite. Ah, all is\nwell, there she is. Pst, mademoiselle! Pst! _Un moment, s'il vous\nplait.___\"\n\nI joined him at the moment that Marthe Daubreuil, looking slightly\nstartled, came running up to the hedge at his call.\n\n\"A little word with you, mademoiselle, if it is permitted?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Monsieur Poirot.\"\n\nDespite her acquiescence, her eyes looked troubled and afraid.\n\n\"Mademoiselle, do you remember running after me on the road the day\nthat I came to your house with the examining magistrate? You asked me\nif any one were suspected of the crime.\"\n\n\"And you told me two Chilians.\" Her voice sounded rather breathless,\nand her left hand stole to her breast.\n\n\"Will you ask me the same question again, mademoiselle?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"This. If you were to ask me that question again, I should give you a\ndifferent answer. Some one is suspected--but not a Chilian.\"\n\n\"Who?\" The word came faintly between her parted lips.\n\n\"M. Jack Renauld.\"\n\n\"What?\" It was a cry. \"Jack? Impossible. Who dares to suspect him?\"\n\n\"Giraud.\"\n\n\"Giraud!\" The girl's face was ashy. \"I am afraid of that man. He is\ncruel. He will--he will--\" She broke off. There was courage gathering in\nher face, and determination. I realized in that moment that she was a\nfighter. Poirot, too, watched her intently.\n\n\"You know, of course, that he was here on the night of the murder?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied mechanically.", "\"He told me.\"\n\n\"It was unwise to have tried to conceal the fact,\" ventured Poirot.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" she replied impatiently. \"But we cannot waste time on\nregrets. We must find something to save him. He is innocent, of course,\nbut that will not help him with a man like Giraud who has his\nreputation to think of. He must arrest some one, and that some one will\nbe Jack.\"\n\n\"The facts will tell against him,\" said Poirot. \"You realize that?\"\n\nShe faced him squarely, and used the words I had heard her say in her\nmother's drawing-room.\n\n\"I am not a child, monsieur. I can be brave and look facts in the face.\nHe is innocent, and we must save him.\"\n\nShe spoke with a kind of desperate energy, then was silent, frowning as\nshe thought.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said Poirot observing her keenly, \"is there not\nsomething that you are keeping back that you could tell us?\"\n\nShe nodded perplexedly.\n\n\"Yes, there is something, but I hardly know whether you will believe\nit--it seems so absurd.\"\n\n\"At any rate, tell us, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"It is this. M. Giraud sent for me, as an afterthought, to see if I\ncould identify the man in there.\" She signed with her head towards the\nshed. \"I could not. At least I could not at the moment. But since I\nhave been thinking--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"It seems so queer, and yet I am almost sure. I will tell you. On the\nmorning of the day M. Renauld was murdered, I was walking in the garden\nhere, when I heard a sound of men's voices quarrelling. I pushed aside\nthe bushes and looked through. One of the men was M. Renauld and the\nother was a tramp, a dreadful looking creature in filthy rags. He was\nalternately whining and threatening. I gathered he was asking for\nmoney, but at that moment _maman___ called me from the house, and I had\nto go. That is all, only--I am almost sure that the tramp and the dead\nman in the shed are one and the same.\"\n\nPoirot uttered an exclamation.", "\"But why did you not say so at the time, mademoiselle?\"\n\n\"Because at first it only struck me that the face was vaguely familiar\nin some way. The man was differently dressed, and apparently belonged\nto a superior station in life. But tell me, Monsieur Poirot, is it not\npossible that this tramp might have attacked and killed M. Renauld, and\ntaken his clothes and money?\"\n\n\"It is an idea, mademoiselle,\" said Poirot slowly. \"It leaves a lot\nunexplained, but it is certainly an idea. I will think of it.\"\n\nA voice called from the house.\n\n\"_Maman___,\" whispered Marthe, \"I must go.\" And she slipped away\nthrough the trees.\n\n\"Come,\" said Poirot, and taking my arm, turned in the direction of the\nVilla.\n\n\"What do you really think?\" I asked, in some curiosity. \"Was that story\ntrue, or did the girl make it up in order to divert suspicion from her\nlover?\"\n\n\"It is a curious tale,\" said Poirot, \"but I believe it to be the\nabsolute truth. Unwittingly, Mademoiselle Marthe told us the truth on\nanother point--and incidentally gave Jack Renauld the lie. Did you\nnotice his hesitation when I asked him if he saw Marthe Daubreuil on\nthe night of the crime? He paused and then said 'Yes.' I suspected that\nhe was lying. It was necessary for me to see Mademoiselle Marthe before\nhe could put her on her guard. Three little words gave me the\ninformation I wanted. When I asked her if she knew that Jack Renauld\nwas here that night, she answered 'He _told___ me.' Now, Hastings, what\nwas Jack Renauld doing here on that eventful evening, and if he did not\nsee Mademoiselle Marthe whom did he see?\"\n\n\"Surely, Poirot,\" I cried, aghast, \"you cannot believe that a boy like\nthat would murder his own father.\"\n\n\"_Mon ami___,\" said Poirot, \"you continue to be of a sentimentality\nunbelievable! I have seen mothers who murdered their little children\nfor the sake of the insurance money! After that, one can believe\nanything.\"\n\n\"And the motive?\"\n\n\"Money of course. Remember that Jack Renauld thought that he would come\nin to half his father's fortune at the latter's death.\"", "\"But the tramp. Where does he come in?\"\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Giraud would say that he was an accomplice--an apache who helped young\nRenauld to commit the crime, and who was conveniently put out of the\nway afterwards.\"\n\n\"But the hair round the dagger? The woman's hair?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Poirot, smiling broadly. \"That is the cream of Giraud's\nlittle jest. According to him, it is not a woman's hair at all.\nRemember that the youths of today wear their hair brushed straight back\nfrom the forehead with pomade or hairwash to make it lie flat.\nConsequently some of the hairs are of considerable length.\"\n\n\"And you believe that too?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Poirot with a curious smile. \"For I know it to be the hair\nof a woman--and more, which woman!\"\n\n\"Madame Daubreuil,\" I announced positively.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Poirot, regarding me quizzically.\n\nBut I refused to allow myself to get annoyed.\n\n\"What are we going to do now?\" I asked, as we entered the hall of the\nVilla Genevieve.\n\n\"I wish to make a search amongst the effects of M. Jack Renauld. That\nis why I had to get him out of the way for a few hours.\"\n\n\"But will not Giraud have searched already?\" I asked doubtfully.\n\n\"Of course. He builds a case, as a beaver builds a dam, with a\nfatiguing industry. But he will not have looked for the things that I\nam seeking--in all probability he would not have seen their importance\nif they stared him in the face. Let us begin.\"\n\nNeatly and methodically, Poirot opened each drawer in turn, examined\nthe contents, and returned them exactly to their places. It was a\nsingularly dull and uninteresting proceeding. Poirot waded on through\ncollars, pajamas and socks. A purring noise outside drew me to the\nwindow. Instantly I became galvanized into life.\n\n\"Poirot!\" I cried. \"A car has just driven up. Giraud is in it, and Jack\nRenauld, and two gendarmes.\"\n\n\"_Sacre tonnerre!___\" growled Poirot. \"That animal of a Giraud, could\nhe not wait? I shall not be able to replace the things in this last\ndrawer with the proper method.", "Let us be quick.\"\n\nUnceremoniously he tumbled out the things on the floor, mostly ties and\nhandkerchiefs. Suddenly with a cry of triumph Poirot pounced on\nsomething, a small square cardboard, evidently a photograph. Thrusting\nit into his pocket, he returned the things pell-mell to the drawer, and\nseizing me by the arm dragged me out of the room and down the stairs.\nIn the hall stood Giraud, contemplating his prisoner.\n\n\"Good afternoon, M. Giraud,\" said Poirot. \"What have we here?\"\n\nGiraud nodded his head towards Jack.\n\n\"He was trying to make a getaway, but I was too sharp for him. He is\nunder arrest for the murder of his father, M. Paul Renauld.\"\n\nPoirot wheeled to confront the boy who leaned limply against the door,\nhis face ashy pale.\n\n\"What do you say to that, _jeune homme?___\"\n\nJack Renauld stared at him stonily.\n\n\"Nothing,\" he said.\n\nI was dumbfounded. Up to the last, I had not been able bring myself to\nbelieve Jack Renauld guilty. I had expected a ringing proclamation of\nhis innocence when Poirot challenged him. But now, watching him as he\nstood, white and limp against the wall, and hearing the damning\nadmission fall from his lips, I doubted no longer.\n\nBut Poirot had turned to Giraud.\n\n\"What are your grounds for arresting him?\"\n\n\"Do you expect me to give them to you?\"\n\n\"As a matter of courtesy, yes.\"\n\nGiraud looked at him doubtfully. He was torn between a desire to refuse\nrudely and the pleasure of triumphing over his adversary.\n\n\"You think I have made a mistake, I suppose?\" he sneered.\n\n\"It would not surprise me,\" replied Poirot, with a soupcon of malice.\n\nGiraud's face took on a deeper tinge of red.\n\n\"_Eh bien___, come in here. You shall judge for yourself.\" He flung\nopen the door of the _salon___, and we passed in, leaving Jack Renauld\nin the care of the two other men.\n\n\"Now, M. Poirot,\" said Giraud laying his hat on the table, and speaking\nwith the utmost sarcasm, \"I will treat you to a little lecture on\ndetective work. I will show you how we moderns work.\"", "\"_Bien!___\" said Poirot, composing himself to listen. \"I will show you\nhow admirably the Old Guard can listen,\" and he leaned back and closed\nhis eyes, opening them for a moment to remark. \"Do not fear that I\nshall sleep. I will attend most carefully.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" began Giraud, \"I soon saw through all that Chilian\ntomfoolery. Two men were in it--but they were not mysterious foreigners!\nAll that was a blind.\"\n\n\"Very creditable so far, my dear Giraud,\" murmured Poirot. \"Especially\nafter that clever trick of theirs with the match and cigarette end.\"\n\nGiraud glared, but continued:\n\n\"A man must have been connected with the case, in order to dig the\ngrave. There is no man who actually benefits by the crime, but there\nwas a man who thought he would benefit. I heard of Jack Renauld's\nquarrel with his father, and of the threats that he had used. The\nmotive was established. Now as to means. Jack Renauld was in\nMerlinville that night. He concealed the fact--which turned suspicion\ninto certainty. Then we found a second victim--_stabbed with the same\ndagger___. We know when that dagger was stolen. Captain Hastings here\ncan fix the time. Jack Renauld, arriving from Cherbourg, was the only\nperson who could have taken it. I have accounted for all the other\nmembers of the household.\"\n\nPoirot interrupted:\n\n\"You are wrong. There is one other person who could have taken the\ndagger.\"\n\n\"You refer to M. Stonor? He arrived at the front door, in an automobile\nwhich had brought him straight from Calais. Ah, believe me, I have\nlooked into everything. M. Jack Renauld arrived by train. An hour\nelapsed between his arrival, and the moment he presented himself at the\nhouse. Without doubt, he saw Captain Hastings and his companion leave\nthe shed, slipped in himself and took the dagger, stabbed his\naccomplice in the shed--\"\n\n\"Who was already dead!\"\n\nGiraud shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Possibly he did not observe that. He may have judged him to be\nsleeping. Without doubt they had a rendezvous. In any case he knew this\napparent second murder would greatly complicate the case.", "It did.\"\n\n\"But it could not deceive M. Giraud,\" murmured Poirot.\n\n\"You mock yourself at me. But I will give you one last irrefutable\nproof. Madame Renauld's story was false--a fabrication from beginning to\nend. We believe Madame Renauld to have loved her husband--_yet she lied\nto shield his murderer___. For whom will a woman lie? Sometimes for\nherself, usually for the man she loves, _always___ for her children.\nThat is the last--the irrefutable proof. You cannot get round it.\"\n\nGiraud paused, flushed and triumphant. Poirot regarded him steadily.\n\n\"That is my case,\" said Giraud. \"What have you to say to it?\"\n\n\"Only that there is one thing you have failed to take into account.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"Jack Renauld was presumably acquainted with the planning out of the\ngolf course. He knew that the body would be discovered almost at once,\nwhen they started to dig the bunker.\"\n\nGiraud laughed out loud.\n\n\"But it is idiotic what you say there! He wanted the body to be found!\nUntil it was found, he could not presume death, and would have been\nunable to enter into his inheritance.\"\n\nI saw a quick flash of green in Poirot's eyes as he rose to his feet.\n\n\"Then why bury it?\" he asked softly. \"Reflect, Giraud. Since it was to\nJack Renauld's advantage that the body should be found without delay,\n_why dig a grave at all?___\"\n\nGiraud did not reply. The question found him unprepared. He shrugged\nhis shoulders as though to intimate that it was of no importance.\n\nPoirot moved towards the door. I followed him.\n\n\"There is one more thing that you have failed to take into account,\" he\nsaid over his shoulder.\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"The piece of lead piping,\" said Poirot, and left the room.\n\nJack Renauld still stood in the hall, with a white dumb face, but as we\ncame out of the _salon___, he looked up sharply. At the same moment\nthere was the sound of a footfall on the staircase. Mrs. Renauld was\ndescending it. At the sight of her son, standing between the two\nmyrmidons of the law, she stopped as though petrified.", "\"Jack,\" she faltered. \"Jack, what is this?\"\n\nHe looked up at her, his face set.\n\n\"They have arrested me, mother.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nShe uttered a piercing cry, and before any one could get to her swayed\nand fell heavily. We both ran to her and lifted her up. In a minute\nPoirot stood up again.\n\n\"She has cut her head badly, on the corner of the stairs. I fancy there\nis a slight concussion also. If Giraud wants a statement from her, he\nwill have to wait. She will probably be unconscious for at least a\nweek.\"\n\nDenise and Francoise had run to their mistress, and leaving her in\ntheir charge Poirot left the house. He walked with his head bent down,\nfrowning thoughtfully at the ground. For some time I did not speak, but\nat last I ventured to put a question to him.\n\n\"Do you believe then, in spite of all appearances to the contrary, that\nJack Renauld may not be guilty?\"\n\nPoirot did not answer at once, but after a long wait he said gravely:\n\n\"I do not know, Hastings. There is just a chance of it. Of course\nGiraud is all wrong--wrong from beginning to end. If Jack Renauld is\nguilty, it is in spite of Giraud's arguments, not _because___ of them.\nAnd the gravest indictment against him is known only to me.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" I asked, impressed.\n\n\"If you would use your grey cells, and see the whole case clearly as I\ndo, you too would perceive it, my friend.\"\n\nThis was what I called one of Poirot's irritating answers. He went on,\nwithout waiting for me to speak.\n\n\"Let us walk this way to the sea. We will sit on that little mound\nthere, overlooking the beach, and review the case. You shall know all\nthat I know, but I would prefer that you should come at the truth by\nyour own efforts--not by my leading you by the hand.\"\n\nWe established ourselves on the grassy knoll as Poirot had suggested,\nlooking out to sea. From farther along the sand, the cries of the\nbathers reached us faintly.", "The sea was of the palest blue, and the\nhalcyon calm reminded me of the day we had arrived at Merlinville, my\nown good spirits, and Poirot's suggestion that I was \"fey.\" What a long\ntime seemed to have elapsed since then. And in reality it was only\nthree days!\n\n\"Think, my friend,\" said Poirot's voice encouragingly. \"Arrange your\nideas. Be methodical. Be orderly. There is the secret of success.\"\n\nI endeavoured to obey him, casting my mind back over all the details of\nthe case. And reluctantly it seemed to me that the only clear and\npossible solution was that of Giraud--which Poirot despised. I reflected\nanew. If there was daylight anywhere it was in the direction of Madame\nDaubreuil. Giraud was ignorant of her connection with the Beroldy Case.\nPoirot had declared the Beroldy Case to be all important. It was there\nI must seek. I was on the right track now. And suddenly I started as an\nidea of bewildering luminosity shot into my brain. Trembling I built up\nmy hypothesis.\n\n\"You have a little idea, I see, _mon ami!___ Capital. We progress.\"\n\nI sat up, and lit a pipe.\n\n\"Poirot,\" I said, \"it seems to me we have been strangely remiss. I say\nwe--although I dare say _I___ would be nearer the mark. But you must pay\nthe penalty of your determined secrecy. So I say again we have been\nstrangely remiss. There is some one we have forgotten.\"\n\n\"And who is that?\" inquired Poirot, with twinkling eyes.\n\n\"Georges Conneau!\"\n\nThe next moment Poirot embraced me warmly. \"_Enfin!___ You have\narrived. And all by yourself. It is superb! Continue your reasoning.\nYou are right. Decidedly we have done wrong to forget Georges Conneau.\"\n\nI was so flattered by the little man's approval that I could hardly\ncontinue. But at last I collected my thoughts and went on.\n\n\"Georges Conneau disappeared twenty years ago, but we have no reason to\nbelieve that he is dead.\"\n\n\"_Aucunement___,\" agreed Poirot. \"Proceed.\"\n\n\"Therefore we will assume that he is alive.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Or that he was alive until recently.\"", "\"_De mieux en mieux!___\"\n\n\"We will presume,\" I continued, my enthusiasm rising, \"that he has\nfallen on evil days. He has become a criminal, an apache, a tramp--a\nwhat you will. He chances to come to Merlinville. There he finds the\nwoman he has never ceased to love.\"\n\n\"Eh eh! The sentimentality,\" warned Poirot.\n\n\"Where one hates one also loves,\" I quoted or misquoted. \"At any rate\nhe finds her there, living under an assumed name. But she has a new\nlover, the Englishman, Renauld. Georges Conneau, the memory of old\nwrongs rising in him, quarrels with this Renauld. He lies in wait for\nhim as he comes to visit his mistress, and stabs him in the back. Then,\nterrified at what he has done, he starts to dig a grave. I imagine it\nlikely that Madame Daubreuil comes out to look for her lover. She and\nConneau have a terrible scene. He drags her into the shed, and there\nsuddenly falls down in an epileptic fit. Now supposing Jack Renauld to\nappear. Madame Daubreuil tells him all, points out to him the dreadful\nconsequences to her daughter if this scandal of the past is revived.\nHis father's murderer is dead--let them do their best to hush it up.\nJack Renauld consents--goes to the house and has an interview with his\nmother, winning her over to his point of view. Primed with the story\nthat Madame Daubreuil has suggested to him, she permits herself to be\ngagged and bound. There, Poirot, what do you think of that?\" I leaned\nback, flushed with the pride of successful reconstruction.\n\nPoirot looked at me thoughtfully.\n\n\"I think that you should write for the Kinema, _mon ami___,\" he\nremarked at last.\n\n\"You mean--?\"\n\n\"It would make a good film, the story that you have recounted to me\nthere--but it bears no sort of resemblance to everyday life.\"\n\n\"I admit that I haven't gone into all the details, but--\"\n\n\"You have gone further--you have ignored them magnificently. What about\nthe way the two men were dressed? Do you suggest that after stabbing\nhis victim, Conneau removed his suit of clothes, donned it himself, and\nreplaced the dagger?\"", "\"I don't see that that matters,\" I objected rather huffily. \"He may\nhave obtained clothes and money from Madame Daubreuil by threats\nearlier in the day.\"\n\n\"By threats--eh? You seriously advance that supposition?\"\n\n\"Certainly. He could have threatened to reveal her identity to the\nRenaulds, which would probably have put an end to all hopes of her\ndaughter's marriage.\"\n\n\"You are wrong, Hastings. He could not blackmail her, for she had the\nwhip hand. Georges Conneau, remember, is still wanted for murder. A\nword from her and he is in danger of the guillotine.\"\n\nI was forced, rather reluctantly, to admit the truth of this.\n\n\"_Your___ theory,\" I remarked acidly, \"is doubtless correct as to all\nthe details?\"\n\n\"My theory is the truth,\" said Poirot quietly. \"And the truth is\nnecessarily correct. In your theory you made a fundamental error. You\npermitted your imagination to lead you astray with midnight\nassignations and passionate love scenes. But in investigating crime we\nmust take our stand upon the commonplace. Shall I demonstrate my\nmethods to you?\"\n\n\"Oh, by all means let us have a demonstration!\"\n\nPoirot sat very upright and began, wagging his forefinger emphatically\nto emphasize his points.\n\n\"I will start as you started from the basic fact of Georges Conneau.\nNow the story told by Madame Beroldy in court as to the 'Russians' was\nadmittedly a fabrication. If she was innocent of connivance in the\ncrime, it was concocted by her, and by her only as she stated. If, on\nthe other hand, she was not innocent, it might have been invented by\neither her or Georges Conneau.\n\n\"Now in this case we are investigating, we meet the same tale. As I\npointed out to you, the facts render it very unlikely that Madame\nDaubreuil inspired it. So we turn to the hypothesis that the story had\nits origin in the brain of Georges Conneau. Very good. Georges Conneau,\ntherefore, planned the crime with Madame Renauld as his accomplice. She\nis in the limelight, and behind her is a shadowy figure whose alias is\nunknown to us.\n\n\"Now let us go carefully over the Renauld Case from the beginning,\nsetting down each significant point in its chronological order.", "You\nhave a notebook and pencil? Good. Now what is the earliest point to\nnote down?\"\n\n\"The letter to you?\"\n\n\"That was the first we knew of it, but it is not the proper beginning\nof the case. The first point of any significance, I should say, is the\nchange that came over M. Renauld shortly after arriving in Merlinville,\nand which is attested to by several witnesses. We have also to consider\nhis friendship with Madame Daubreuil, and the large sums of money paid\nover to her. From thence we can come directly to the 23rd May.\"\n\nPoirot paused, cleared his throat, and signed to me to write.\n\n\"_23rd May.___ M. Renauld quarrels with his son over latter's wish to\nmarry Marthe Daubreuil. Son leaves for Paris.\n\n\"_24th May.___ M. Renauld alters his will, leaving entire control of\nhis fortune in his wife's hands.\n\n\"_7th June.___ Quarrel with tramp in garden, witnessed by Marthe\nDaubreuil.\n\n\"Letter written to M.

As he is seeing her out, his words are\n'Yes, yes--but for God's sake go now. ...' \"\n\nPoirot paused.\n\n\"There, Hastings, take each of those facts one by one, consider them\ncarefully by themselves and in relation to the whole, and see if you do\nnot get new light on the matter.\"\n\nI endeavoured conscientiously to do as he had said. After a moment or\ntwo, I said rather doubtfully:\n\n\"As to the first points, the question seems to be whether we adopt the\ntheory of blackmail, or of an infatuation for this woman.\"\n\n\"Blackmail, decidedly. You heard what Stonor said as to his character\nand habits.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Renauld did not confirm his view,\" I argued.\n\n\"We have already seen that Madame Renauld's testimony cannot be relied\nupon in any way. We must trust to Stonor on that point.\"\n\n\"Still, if Renauld had an affair with a woman called Bella, there seems\nno inherent improbability in his having another with Madame Daubreuil.\"", "\"None whatever, I grant you, Hastings. But did he?\"\n\n\"The letter, Poirot. You forget the letter.\"\n\n\"No, I do not forget. But what makes you think that letter was written\nto M. Renauld?\"\n\n\"Why it was found in his pocket and--and--\"\n\n\"And that is all!\" cut in Poirot. \"There was no mention of any name to\nshow to whom the letter was addressed. We assumed it was to the dead\nman because it was in the pocket of his overcoat. Now, _mon ami___,\nsomething about that overcoat struck me as unusual. I measured it, and\nmade the remark that he wore his overcoat very long. That remark should\nhave given you to think.\"\n\n\"I thought you were just saying it for the sake of saying something,\" I\nconfessed.\n\n\"Ah, _quelle idee!___ Later you observed me measuring the overcoat of\nM. Jack Renauld. _Eh bien___, M. Jack Renauld wears his overcoat very\nshort. Put those two facts together with a third, namely that M. Jack\nRenauld flung out of the house in a hurry on his departure for Paris,\nand tell me what you make of it!\"\n\n\"I see,\" I said slowly, as the meaning of Poirot's remarks bore in upon\nme. \"That letter was written to Jack Renauld--not to his father. He\ncaught up the wrong overcoat in his haste and agitation.\"\n\nPoirot nodded.\n\n\"_Precisement!___ We can return to this point later. For the moment let\nus content ourselves with accepting the letter as having nothing to do\nwith M. Renauld _pere___, and pass to the next chronological event.\"\n\n\"May 23rd,\" I read, \"M. Renauld quarrels with his son over latter's\nwish to marry Marthe Daubreuil. Son leaves for Paris. I don't see\nanything much to remark upon there, and the altering of the will the\nfollowing day seems straightforward enough. It was the direct result of\nthe quarrel.\"\n\n\"We agree, _mon ami___--at least as to the cause. But what exact motive\nunderlay this procedure of M. Renauld's?\"\n\nI opened my eyes in surprise.\n\n\"Anger against his son of course.\"\n\n\"Yet he wrote him affectionate letters to Paris?\"", "\"So Jack Renauld says, but he cannot produce them.\"\n\n\"Well, let us pass from that.\"\n\n\"Now we come to the day of the tragedy. You have placed the events of\nthe morning in a certain order. Have you any justification for that?\"\n\n\"I have ascertained that the letter to me was posted at the same time\nas the telegram was despatched. Masters was informed he could take a\nholiday shortly afterwards. In my opinion the quarrel with the tramp\ntook place anterior to these happenings.\"\n\n\"I do not see that you can fix that definitely--unless you question\nMademoiselle Dabreuil again.\"\n\n\"There is no need. I am sure of it. And if you do not see that, you see\nnothing, Hastings!\"\n\nI looked at him for a moment.\n\n\"Of course! I am an idiot. If the tramp was Georges Conneau, it was\nafter the stormy interview with him that Mr. Renauld apprehended\ndanger. He sent away the chauffeur, Masters, whom he suspected of being\nin the other's pay, he wired to his son, and sent for you.\"\n\nA faint smile crossed Poirot's lips.\n\n\"You do not think it strange that he should use exactly the same\nexpressions in his letter as Madame Renauld used later in her story? If\nthe mention of Santiago was a blind, why should Renauld speak of it,\nand--what is more--send his son there?\"\n\n\"It is puzzling, I admit, but perhaps we shall find some explanation\nlater. We come now to the evening, and the visit of the mysterious\nlady. I confess that that fairly baffles me, unless it was Madame\nDaubreuil, as Francoise all along maintained.\"\n\nPoirot shook his head.\n\n\"My friend, my friend, where are your wits wandering? Remember the\nfragment of cheque, and the fact that the name Bella Duveen was faintly\nfamiliar to Stonor, and I think we may take it for granted that Bella\nDuveen is the full name of Jack's unknown correspondent, and that it\nwas she who came to the Villa Genevieve that night. Whether she\nintended to see Jack, or whether she meant all along to appeal to his\nfather we cannot be certain, but I think we may assume that this is\nwhat occurred.", "She produced her claim upon Jack, probably showed\nletters that he had written her, and the older man tried to buy her off\nby writing a cheque. This she indignantly tore up. The terms of her\nletter are those of a woman genuinely in love, and she would probably\ndeeply resent being offered money. In the end he got rid of her, and\nhere the words that he used are significant.\"\n\n\" 'Yes, yes, but for God's sake go now,' \" I repeated. \"They seem to me\na little vehement, perhaps, that is all.\"\n\n\"That is enough. He was desperately anxious for the girl to go. Why?\nNot only because the interview was unpleasant. No, it was the time that\nwas slipping by, and for some reason time was precious.\"\n\n\"Why should it be?\" I asked, bewildered.\n\n\"That is what we ask ourselves. Why should it be? But later we have the\nincident of the wrist watch--which again shows us that time plays a very\nimportant part in the crime. We are now fast approaching the actual\ndrama. It is half-past ten when Bella Duveen leaves, and by the\nevidence of the wrist watch we know that the crime was committed, or at\nany rate that it was staged, before twelve o'clock. We have reviewed\nall the events anterior to the murder, there remains only one unplaced.\nBy the doctor's evidence, the tramp, when found, had been dead at least\nforty-eight hours--with a possible margin of twenty-four hours more.\nNow, with no other facts to help me than those we have discussed, I\nplace the death as having occurred on the morning of June 7th.\"\n\nI stared at him, stupefied.\n\n\"But how? Why? How can you possibly know?\"\n\n\"Because only in that way can the sequence of events be logically\nexplained. _Mon ami___, I have taken you step by step along the way. Do\nyou not now see what is so glaringly plain?\"\n\n\"My dear Poirot, I can't see anything glaring about it. I did think I\nwas beginning to see my way before, but I'm now hopelessly fogged.\"", "Poirot looked at me sadly, and shook his head. \"_Mon Dieu!___ But it is\n_triste!___ A good intelligence--and so deplorably lacking in method.\nThere is an exercise most excellent for the development of the little\ngrey cells. I will impart it to you--\"\n\n\"For Heaven's sake, not now! You really are the most irritating of\nfellows, Poirot. For goodness' sake, get on and tell me who killed M.\nRenauld.\"\n\n\"That is just what I am not sure of as yet.\"\n\n\"But you said it was glaringly clear?\"\n\n\"We talk at cross-purposes, my friend. Remember, it is two crimes we\nare investigating--for which, as I pointed out to you, we have the\nnecessary two bodies. There, there, _ne vous impatientez pas!___ I\nexplain all. To begin with, we apply our psychology. We find three\npoints at which M. Renauld displays a distinct change of view and\naction--three psychological points therefore. The first occurs\nimmediately after arriving in Merlinville, the second after quarrelling\nwith his son on a certain subject, the third on the morning of June\n7th. Now for the three causes. We can attribute No. 1 to meeting Madame\nDaubreuil. No. 2 is indirectly connected with her since it concerns a\nmarriage between M. Renauld's son and her daughter. But the cause of\nNo. 3 is hidden from us. We have to deduce it. Now, _mon ami___, let me\nask you a question; who do we believe to have planned this crime?\"\n\n\"Georges Conneau,\" I said doubtfully, eyeing Poirot warily.\n\n\"Exactly. Now Giraud laid it down as an axiom that a woman lies to save\nherself, the man she loves, and her child. Since we are satisfied that\nwas Georges Conneau who dictated the lie to her, and as Georges Conneau\nis not Jack Renauld, follows that the third case is put out of court.\nAnd, still attributing the crime to Georges Conneau, the first is\nequally so. So we are forced to the second--that Madame Renauld lied for\nthe sake of the man she loved--or in other words, for the sake of\nGeorges Conneau. You agree to that.\"", "\"Yes,\" I admitted. \"It seems logical enough.\"\n\n\"_Bien!___ Madame Renauld loves Georges Conneau. Who, then, is Georges\nConneau?\"\n\n\"The tramp.\"\n\n\"Have we any evidence to show that Madame Renauld loved the tramp?\"\n\n\"No, but--\"\n\n\"Very well then. Do not cling to theories where facts no longer support\nthem. Ask yourself instead who Madame Renauld _did___ love.\"\n\nI shook my head perplexed.\n\n\"_Mais, oui___, you know perfectly. Who did Madame Renauld love so\ndearly that when she saw his dead body, she fell down in a swoon?\"\n\nI stared dumbfounded.\n\n\"Her husband?\" I gasped.\n\nPoirot nodded.\n\n\"Her husband--or Georges Conneau, whichever you like to call him.\"\n\nI rallied myself.\n\n\"But it's impossible.\"\n\n\"How 'impossible?' Did we not agree just now that Madame Daubreuil was\nin a position to blackmail Georges Conneau?\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\"\n\n\"And did she not very effectively blackmail M. Renauld?\"\n\n\"That may be true enough, but--\"\n\n\"And is it not a fact that we know nothing of M. Renauld's youth and\nupbringing? That he springs suddenly into existence as a French\nCanadian exactly twenty-two years ago?\"\n\n\"All that is so,\" I said more firmly, \"but you seem to me to be\noverlooking one salient point.\"\n\n\"What is it, my friend?\"\n\n\"Why, we have admitted Georges Conneau planned the crime. That brings\nus to the ridiculous statement that he planned his own murder!\"\n\n\"_Eh bien, mon ami___,\" said Poirot placidly, \"that is just what he did\ndo!\"\n\nIn a measured voice, Poirot began his exposition.\n\n\"It seems strange to you, _mon ami___, that a man should plan his own\ndeath? So strange, that you prefer to reject the truth as fantastic,\nand to revert to a story that is in reality ten times more impossible.\nYes, M. Renauld planned his own death, but there is one detail that\nperhaps escapes you--he did not intend to die.\"\n\nI shook my head, bewildered.\n\n\"But no, it is all most simple really,\" said Poirot kindly. \"For the\ncrime that M. Renauld proposed a murderer was not necessary, as I told\nyou, but a body was. Let us reconstruct, seeing events this time from a\ndifferent angle.", "\"Georges Conneau flies from justice--to Canada. There, under an assumed\nname he marries, and finally acquires a vast fortune in South America.\nBut there is a nostalgia upon him for his own country. Twenty years\nhave elapsed, he is considerably changed in appearance, besides being a\nman of such eminence that no one is likely to connect him with a\nfugitive from justice many years ago. He deems it quite safe to return.\nHe takes up his headquarters in England, but intends to spend the\nsummers in France. And ill fortune, that obscure justice which shapes\nmen's ends, and will not allow them to evade the consequences of their\nacts, takes him to Merlinville. There, in the whole of France, is the\none person who is capable of recognizing him. It is, of course, a gold\nmine to Madame Daubreuil, and a gold mine of which she is not slow to\ntake advantage. He is helpless, absolutely in her power. And she bleeds\nhim heavily.\n\n\"And then the inevitable happens. Jack Renauld falls in love with the\nbeautiful girl he sees almost daily, and wishes to marry her. That\nrouses his father. At all costs, he will prevent his son marrying the\ndaughter of this evil woman. Jack Renauld knows nothing of his father's\npast, but Madame Renauld knows everything. She is a woman of great\nforce of character, and passionately devoted to her husband. They take\ncounsel together. Renauld sees only one way of escape--death. He must\nappear to die, in reality escaping to another country where he will\nstart again under an assumed name, and where Madame Renauld, having\nplayed the widow's part for a while, can join him. It is essential that\nshe should have control of the money, so he alters his will. How they\nmeant to manage the body business originally, I do not know--possibly an\nart student's skeleton--and a fire or something of the kind, but long\nbefore their plans have matured an event occurs which plays into their\nhands. A rough tramp, violent and abusive, finds his way into the\ngarden.", "There is a struggle, M. Renauld seeks to eject him, and\nsuddenly the tramp, an epileptic, falls down in a fit. He is dead. M.\nRenauld calls his wife. Together they drag him into the shed--as we\nknow, the event had occurred just outside--and they realize the\nmarvellous opportunity that has been vouchsafed them. The man bears no\nresemblance to M. Renauld, but he is middle-aged, of a usual French\ntype. That is sufficient.\n\n\"I rather fancy that they sat on the bench up there, out of earshot\nfrom the house, discussing matters. Their plan was quickly made. The\nidentification must rest solely on Madame Renauld's evidence. Jack\nRenauld and the chauffeur (who had been with his master two years) must\nbe got out of the way. It was unlikely that the French women servants\nwould go near the body, and in any case Renauld intended to take\nmeasures to deceive any one not likely to appreciate details. Masters\nwas sent off, a telegram despatched to Jack, Buenos Ayres being\nselected to give credence to the story that Renauld had decided upon.\nHaving heard of me, as a rather obscure elderly detective, he wrote his\nappeal for help knowing that, when I arrived, the production of the\nletter would have a profound effect upon the examining\nmagistrate--which, of course, it did.\n\n\"They dressed the body of the tramp in a suit of M. Renauld's and left\nhis ragged coat and trousers by the door of the shed, not daring to\ntake them into the house. And then, to give credence to the tale Madame\nRenauld was to tell, they drove the aeroplane dagger through his heart.\nThat night, M. Renauld will first bind and gag his wife, and then,\ntaking a spade, will dig a grave in that particular spot of ground\nwhere he knows a--how do you call it? bunkair?--is to be made. It is\nessential that the body should be found--Madame Daubreuil must have no\nsuspicions. On the other hand, if a little time elapses, any dangers as\nto identity will be greatly lessened.", "Then, M. Renauld will don the\ntramp's rags, and shuffle off to the station, where he will leave,\nunnoticed, by the 12:10 train. Since the crime will be supposed to have\ntaken place two hours later, no suspicion can possibly attach to him.\n\n\"You see now his annoyance at the inopportune visit of the girl Bella.\nEvery moment of delay is fatal to his plans. He gets rid of her as soon\nas he can, however. Then, to work! He leaves the front door slightly\najar to create the impression that the assassins left that way. He\nbinds and gags Madame Renauld, correcting his mistake of twenty-two\nyears ago, when the looseness of the bonds caused suspicion to fall\nupon his accomplice, but leaving her primed with essentially the same\nstory as he had invented before, proving the unconscious recoil of the\nmind against originality. The night is chilly, and he slips on an\novercoat over his underclothing, intending to cast it into the grave\nwith the dead man. He goes out by the window, smoothing over the flower\nbed carefully, and thereby furnishing the most positive evidence\nagainst himself. He goes out on to the lonely golf links, and he\ndigs--and then--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"And then,\" said Poirot gravely, \"the justice that he has so long\neluded overtakes him. An unknown hand stabs him in the back. ... Now,\nHastings, you understand what I mean when I talk of _two___ crimes. The\nfirst crime, the crime that M. Renauld, in his arrogance, asked us to\ninvestigate (ah, but he made a famous mistake there! He misjudged\nHercule Poirot!) is solved. But behind it lies a deeper riddle. And to\nsolve that will be difficult--since the criminal in his wisdom, has been\ncontent to avail himself of the devices prepared by M. Renauld. It has\nbeen a particularly perplexing and baffling mystery to solve. A young\nhand, like Giraud, who does not place any reliance on the psychology,\nis almost certain to fail.\"\n\n\"You're marvellous, Poirot,\" I said, with admiration. \"Absolutely\nmarvellous. No one on earth but you could have done it!\"", "I think my praise pleased him. For once in his life, he looked almost\nembarrassed.\n\n\"Ah, then you no longer despise poor old Papa Poirot? You shift your\nallegiance back from the human foxhound?\"\n\nHis term for Giraud never failed to make me smile.\n\n\"Rather. You've scored over him handsomely.\"\n\n\"That poor Giraud,\" said Poirot, trying unsuccessfully to look modest.\n\"Without doubt it is not all stupidity. He has had _la mauvaise\nchance___ once or twice. That dark hair coiled round the dagger, for\ninstance. To say the least, it was misleading.\"\n\n\"To tell you the truth, Poirot,\" I said slowly, \"even now I don't quite\nsee--whose hair was it?\"\n\n\"Madame Renauld's of course. That is where _la mauvaise chance___ came\nin. Her hair, dark originally, is almost completely silvered. It might\njust as easily have been a grey hair--and then, by no conceivable effort\ncould Giraud have persuaded himself it came from the head of Jack\nRenauld! But it is all of a piece. Always the facts must be twisted to\nfit the theory! Did not Giraud find the traces of two persons, a man\nand a woman, in the shed? And how does that fit in with his\nreconstruction of the case? I will tell you--it does not fit in, and so\nwe shall hear no more of them! I ask you, is that a methodical way of\nworking? The great Giraud! The great Giraud is nothing but a toy\nballoon--swollen with its own importance. But I, Hercule Poirot, whom he\ndespises, will be the little pin that pricks the big balloon--_comme\nca!___\" And he made an expressive gesture. Then, calming down, he\nresumed:\n\n\"Without doubt, when Madame Renauld recovers, she will speak. The\npossibility of her son being accused of the murder never occurred to\nher. How should it, when she believed him safely at sea on board the\n_Anzora?___ _Ah! voila une femme___, Hastings! What force, what\nself-command! She only made one slip. On his unexpected return: 'It\ndoes not matter--_now___.' And no one noticed--no one realized the\nsignificance of those words.", "What a terrible part she has had to play,\npoor woman. Imagine the shock when she goes to identify the body and,\ninstead of what she expects, sees the actual lifeless form of the\nhusband she has believed miles away by now. No wonder she fainted! But\nsince then, despite her grief and her despair, how resolutely she has\nplayed her part, and how the anguish of it must wring her. She cannot\nsay a word to set us on the track of the real murderers. For her son's\nsake, no one must know that Paul Renauld was Georges Conneau, the\ncriminal. Final and most bitter blow, she has admitted publicly that\nMadame Daubreuil was her husband's mistress--for a hint of blackmail\nmight be fatal to her secret. How cleverly she dealt with the examining\nmagistrate when he asked her if there was any mystery in her husband's\npast life. 'Nothing so romantic, I am sure, M. le juge.' It was\nperfect, the indulgent tone, the _soupcon___ of sad mockery. At once M.\nHautet felt himself foolish and melodramatic. Yes, she is a great\nwoman! If she loved a criminal, she loved him royally!\"\n\nPoirot lost himself in contemplation.\n\n\"One thing more, Poirot, what about the piece of lead piping?\"\n\n\"You do not see? To disfigure the victim's face so that it would be\nunrecognizable. It was that which first set me on the right track. And\nthat imbecile of a Giraud, swarming all over it to look for match ends!\nDid I not tell you that a clue of two feet long was quite as good as a\nclue of two inches?\"\n\n\"Well, Giraud will sing small now,\" I observed hastily, to lead the\nconversation away from my own shortcomings.\n\n\"As I said before, will he? If he has arrived at the right person by\nthe wrong method, he will not permit that to worry him.\"\n\n\"But surely--\" I paused as I saw the new trend of things.\n\n\"You see, Hastings, we must now start again. Who killed M. Renauld?\nSome one who was near the Villa just before twelve o'clock that night,\nsome one who would benefit by his death--the description fits Jack\nRenauld only too well.", "The crime need not have been premeditated. And\nthen the dagger!\"\n\nI started, I had not realized that point.\n\n\"Of course,\" I said. \"The second dagger we found in the tramp was Mrs.\nRenauld's. There _were___ two, then.\"\n\n\"Certainly, and, since they were duplicates, it stands to reason that\nJack Renauld was the owner. But that would not trouble me so much. In\nfact I have a little idea as to that. No, the worst indictment against\nhim is again psychological--heredity, _mon ami___, heredity! Like\nfather, like son--Jack Renauld, when all is said or done, is the son of\nGeorges Conneau.\"\n\nHis tone was grave and earnest, and I was impressed in spite of myself.\n\n\"What is your little idea that you mentioned just now?\" I asked.\n\nFor answer, Poirot consulted his turnip-faced watch, and then asked:\n\n\"What time is the afternoon boat from Calais?\"\n\n\"About five, I believe.\"\n\n\"That will do very well. We shall just have time.\"\n\n\"You are going to England?\"\n\n\"Yes, my friend.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"To find a possible--witness.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\nWith a rather peculiar smile upon his face, Poirot replied:\n\n\"Miss Bella Duveen.\"\n\n\"But how will you find her--what do you know about her?\"\n\n\"I know nothing about her--but I can guess a good deal. We may take it\nfor granted that her name _is___ Bella Duveen, and since that name was\nfaintly familiar to M. Stonor, though evidently not in connection with\nthe Renauld family, it is probable that she is on the stage. Jack\nRenauld was a young man with plenty of money, and twenty years of age.\nThe stage is sure to have been the home of his first love. It tallies,\ntoo, with M. Renauld's attempt to placate her with a cheque. I think I\nshall find her all right--especially with the help of _this___.\"\n\nAnd he brought out the photograph I had seen him take from Jack\nRenauld's drawer. \"With love from Bella,\" was scrawled across the\ncorner, but it was not that which held my eyes fascinated. The likeness\nwas not first rate--but for all that it was unmistakable to me.", "I felt a\ncold sinking, as though some unutterable calamity had befallen me.\n\nIt was the face of Cinderella.\n\nFor a moment or two I sat as though frozen, the photograph still in my\nhand. Then, summoning all my courage to appear unmoved, I handed it\nback. At the same time, I stole a quick glance at Poirot. Had he\nnoticed anything? But to my relief he did not seem to be observing me.\nAnything unusual in my manner had certainly escaped him.\n\nHe rose briskly to his feet.\n\n\"We have no time to lose. We must make our departure with all despatch.\nAll is well--the sea it will be calm!\"\n\nIn the bustle of departure, I had no time for thinking, but once on\nboard the boat, secure from Poirot's observation (he, as usual, was\n\"practising the method most excellent of Laverguier\") I pulled myself\ntogether, and attacked the facts dispassionately. How much did Poirot\nknow? Was he aware that my acquaintance of the train and Bella Duveen\nwere one and the same? Why had he gone to the Hotel du Phare? On my\nbehalf as I had believed? Or had I only fatuously thought so, and was\nthis visit undertaken with a deeper and more sinister purpose?\n\nBut in any case, why was he bent on finding this girl? Did he suspect\nher of having seen Jack Renauld commit the crime? Or did he suspect--but\nthat was impossible! The girl had no grudge against the elder Renauld,\nno possible motive for wishing his death. What had brought her back to\nthe scene of the murder? I went over the facts carefully. She must have\nleft the train at Calais where I parted from her that day. No wonder I\nhad been unable to find her on the boat. If she had dined in Calais,\nand then taken a train out to Merlinville, she would have arrived at\nthe Villa Genevieve just about the time that Francoise said. What had\nshe done when she left the house just after ten? Presumably either gone\nto an hotel, or returned to Calais.", "And then? The crime had been\ncommitted on Tuesday night. On Thursday morning, she was once more in\nMerlinville. Had she ever left France at all? I doubted it very much.\nWhat kept her there--the hope of seeing Jack Renauld? I had told her (as\nat the time we believed) that he was on the high seas _en route___ to\nBuenos Ayres. Possibly she was aware that the _Anzora___ had not\nsailed. But to know that she must have seen Jack. Was that what Poirot\nwas after? Had Jack Renauld, returning to see Marthe Daubreuil, come\nface to face instead with Bella Duveen, the girl he had heartlessly\nthrown over?\n\nI began to see daylight. If that were indeed the case, it might furnish\nJack with the alibi he needed. Yet under those circumstances his\nsilence seemed difficult to explain. Why could he not have spoken out\nboldly? Did he fear for this former entanglement of his to come to the\nears of Marthe Daubreuil? I shook my head, dissatisfied. The thing had\nbeen harmless enough, a foolish boy and girl affair, and I reflected\ncynically that the son of a millionaire was not likely to be thrown\nover by a penniless French girl, who moreover loved him devotedly,\nwithout a much graver cause.\n\nAltogether I found the affair puzzling and unsatisfactory. I disliked\nintensely being associated with Poirot in hunting this girl down, but I\ncould not see any way of avoiding it, without revealing everything to\nhim, and this, for some reason, I was loath to do.\n\nPoirot reappeared brisk and smiling at Dover, and our journey to London\nwas uneventful. It was past nine o'clock when we arrived, and I\nsupposed that we should return straight away to our rooms and do\nnothing till the morning. But Poirot had other plans.\n\n\"We must lose no time, _mon ami___. The news of the arrest will not be\nin the English papers until the day after tomorrow, but still we must\nlose no time.\"\n\nI did not quite follow his reasoning, but I merely asked how he\nproposed to find the girl.", "\"You remember Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent? No? I assisted him\nin a little matter of a Japanese wrestler. A pretty little problem, I\nmust recount it to you one day. He, without doubt, will be able to put\nus in the way of finding out what we want to know.\"\n\nIt took us some time to run Mr. Aarons to earth, and it was after\nmidnight when we finally managed it. He greeted Poirot with every\nevidence of warmth, and professed himself ready to be of service to us\nin any way.\n\n\"There's not much about the profession I don't know,\" he said, beaming\ngenially.\n\n\"_Eh bien___, M. Aarons, I desire to find a young girl called Bella\nDuveen.\"\n\n\"Bella Duveen. I know the name, but for the moment I can't place it.\nWhat's her line?\"\n\n\"That I do not know--but here is her photograph.\"\n\nMr. Aarons studied it for a moment, then his face lighted.\n\n\"Got it!\" He slapped his thigh. \"The Dulcibella Kids, by the Lord!\"\n\n\"The Dulcibella Kids?\"\n\n\"That's it. They're sisters. Acrobats, dancers and singers. Give quite\na good little turn. They're in the provinces somewhere, I believe--if\nthey're not resting. They've been on in Paris for the last two or three\nweeks.\"\n\n\"Can you find out for me exactly where they are?\"\n\n\"Easy as a bird. You go home, and I'll send you round the dope in the\nmorning.\"\n\nWith this promise we took leave of him. He was as good as his word.\nAbout eleven o'clock the following day, a scribbled note reached us.\n\n\"The Dulcibella Sisters are on at the Palace in Coventry. Good luck to\nyou.\"\n\nWithout more ado, we started for Coventry. Poirot made no inquiries at\nthe theatre, but contented himself with booking stalls for the variety\nperformance that evening.\n\nThe show was wearisome beyond words--or perhaps it was only my mood that\nmade it seem so. Japanese families balanced themselves precariously,\nwould-be fashionable men, in greenish evening dress and exquisitely\nslicked hair, reeled off society patter and danced marvellously, stout\nprima donnas sang at the top of the human register, a comic comedian\nendeavoured to be Mr.", "George Robey and failed signally.\n\nAt last the number went up which announced the Dulcibella Kids. My\nheart beat sickeningly. There she was--there they both were, the pair of\nthem, one flaxen haired, one dark, matching as to size, with short\nfluffy skirts and immense buster brown bows. They looked a pair of\nextremely piquant children. They began to sing. Their voices were fresh\nand true, rather thin and music-hally, but attractive.\n\nIt was quite a pretty little turn. They danced neatly, and did some\nclever little acrobatic feats. The words of their songs were crisp and\ncatchy. When the curtain fell, there was a full meed of applause.\nEvidently the Dulcibella Kids were a success.\n\nSuddenly I felt that I could remain no longer. I must get out into the\nair. I suggested leaving to Poirot.\n\n\"Go by all means, _mon ami___. I amuse myself, and will stay to the\nend. I will rejoin you later.\"\n\nIt was only a few steps from the theatre to the hotel. I went up to the\nsitting-room, ordered a whisky and soda, and sat drinking it, staring\nmeditatively into the empty grate. I heard the door open, and turned my\nhead, thinking it was Poirot. Then I jumped to my feet. It was\nCinderella who stood in the doorway. She spoke haltingly, her breath\ncoming in little gasps.\n\n\"I saw you in front. You and your friend. When you got up to go, I was\nwaiting outside and followed you. Why are you here--in Coventry? What\nwere you doing there to-night? Is the man who was with you the--the\ndetective?\"\n\nShe stood there, the cloak she had wrapped round her stage dress\nslipping from her shoulders. I saw the whiteness of her cheeks under\nthe rouge, and heard the terror in her voice. And in that moment I\nunderstood everything--understood why Poirot was seeking her, and what\nshe feared, and understood at last my own heart. ...\n\n\"Yes,\" I said gently.\n\n\"Is he looking for--me?\" she half whispered.\n\nThen, as I did not answer for a moment, she slipped down by the big\nchair, and burst into violent, bitter weeping.", "I knelt down by her, holding her in my arms, and smoothing the hair\nback from her face.\n\n\"Don't cry, child, don't cry, for God's sake. You're safe here. I'll\ntake care of you. Don't cry, darling. Don't cry. I know--I know\neverything.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you don't!\"\n\n\"I think I do.\" And after a moment, as her sobs grew quieter, I asked:\n\"It was you who took the dagger, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That was why you wanted me to show you round? And why you pretended to\nfaint?\"\n\nAgain she nodded. It was a strange thought to come to me at the moment,\nbut it shot into my mind that I was glad her motive was what it had\nbeen--rather than the idle and morbid curiosity I had accused her of at\nthe time. How gallantly she had played her part that day, inwardly\nracked with fear and trepidation as she must have been. Poor little\nsoul, bearing the burden of a moment's impetuous action.\n\n\"Why did you take the dagger?\" I asked presently.\n\nShe replied as simply as a child:\n\n\"I was afraid there might be finger-marks on it.\"\n\n\"But didn't you remember that you had worn gloves?\"\n\nShe shook her head as though bewildered, and then said slowly:\n\n\"Are you going to give me up to--to the Police?\"\n\n\"Good God! no.\"\n\nHer eyes sought mine long and earnestly, and then she asked in a little\nquiet voice that sounded afraid of itself:\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nIt seemed a strange place and a strange time for a declaration of\nlove--and God knows, in all my imagining, I had never pictured love\ncoming to me in such a guise. But I answered simply and naturally\nenough:\n\n\"Because I love you, Cinderella.\"\n\nShe bent her head down, as though ashamed, and muttered in a broken\nvoice:\n\n\"You can't--you can't--not if you knew--\" And then, as though rallying\nherself, she faced me squarely, and asked:\n\n\"What do you know, then?\"\n\n\"I know that you came to see Mr. Renauld that night. He offered you a\ncheque and you tore it up indignantly.", "Then you left the house--\" I\npaused.\n\n\"Go on--what next?\"\n\n\"I don't know whether you knew that Jack Renauld would be coming that\nnight, or whether you just waited about on the chance of seeing him,\nbut you did wait about. Perhaps you were just miserable, and walked\naimlessly--but at any rate just before twelve you were still near there,\nand you saw a man on the golf links--\"\n\nAgain I paused. I had leapt to the truth in a flash as she entered the\nroom, but now the picture rose before me even more convincingly. I saw\nvividly the peculiar pattern of the overcoat on the dead body of Mr.\nRenauld, and I remembered the amazing likeness that had startled me\ninto believing for one instant that the dead man had risen from the\ndead when his son burst into our conclave in the _salon___.\n\n\"Go on,\" repeated the girl steadily.\n\n\"I fancy his back was to you--but you recognized him, or thought you\nrecognized him. The gait and the carriage were familiar to you, and the\npattern of his overcoat.\" I paused. \"You told me in the train on the\nway from Paris that you had Italian blood in your veins, and that you\nhad nearly got into trouble once with it. You used a threat in one of\nyour letters to Jack Renauld. When you saw him there, your anger and\njealousy drove you mad--and you struck! I don't believe for a minute\nthat you meant to kill him. But you did kill him, Cinderella.\"\n\nShe had flung up her hands to cover her face, and in a choked voice she\nsaid:\n\n\"You're right ... you're right ... I can see it all as you tell it.\" Then\nshe turned on me almost savagely. \"And you love me? Knowing what you\ndo, how can you love me?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I said a little wearily. \"I think love is like that--a\nthing one cannot help. I have tried, I know--ever since the first day I\nmet you. And love has been too strong for me.\"", "And then suddenly, when I least expected it, she broke down again,\ncasting herself down on the floor and sobbing wildly.\n\n\"Oh, I can't!\" she cried. \"I don't know what to do. I don't know which\nway to turn. Oh, pity me, pity me, some one, and tell me what to do!\"\n\nAgain I knelt by her, soothing her as best I could.\n\n\"Don't be afraid of me, Bella. For God's sake don't be afraid of me. I\nlove you, that's true--but I don't want anything in return. Only let me\nhelp you. Love him still if you have to, but let me help you as he\ncan't.\"\n\nIt was as though she had been turned to stone by my words. She raised\nher head from her hands and stared at me.\n\n\"You think that?\" she whispered. \"You think that I love Jack Renauld?\"\n\nThen, half laughing, half crying, she flung her arms passionately round\nmy neck, and pressed her sweet wet face to mine.\n\n\"Not as I love you,\" she whispered. \"Never as I love you!\"\n\nHer lips brushed my cheek, and then, seeking my mouth, kissed me again\nand again with a sweetness and fire beyond belief. The wildness of\nit--and the wonder, I shall not forget--no, not as long as I live!\n\nIt was a sound in the doorway that made us look up. Poirot was standing\nthere looking at us.\n\nI did not hesitate. With a bound I reached him and pinioned his arms to\nhis sides.\n\n\"Quick,\" I said to the girl. \"Get out of here. As fast as you can. I'll\nhold him.\"\n\nWith one look at me, she fled out of the room past us. I held Poirot in\na grip of iron.\n\n\"_Mon ami___,\" observed the latter mildly, \"you do this sort of thing\nvery well. The strong man holds me in his grasp and I am helpless as a\nchild. But all this is uncomfortable and slightly ridiculous. Let us\nsit down and be calm.\"\n\n\"You won't pursue her?\"\n\n\"_Mon Dieu!___ no. Am I Giraud? Release me, my friend.\"", "Keeping a suspicious eye upon him, for I paid Poirot the compliment of\nknowing that I was no match for him in astuteness, I relaxed my grip,\nand he sank into an arm-chair, feeling his arms tenderly.\n\n\"It is that you have the strength of a bull when you are roused,\nHastings! _Eh bien___, and do you think you have behaved well to your\nold friend? I show you the girl's photograph and you recognize it, but\nyou never say a word.\"\n\n\"There was no need if you knew that I recognized it,\" I said rather\nbitterly. So Poirot had known all along! I had not deceived him for an\ninstant.\n\n\"Ta-ta! You did not know that I knew that. And tonight you help the\ngirl to escape when we have found her with so much trouble! _Eh\nbien!___ it comes to this--are you going to work with me or against me,\nHastings?\"\n\nFor a moment or two I did not answer. To break with my old friend gave\nme great pain. Yet I must definitely range myself against him. Would he\never forgive me, I wondered? He had been strangely calm so far, but I\nknew him to possess marvellous self-command.\n\n\"Poirot,\" I said, \"I'm sorry. I admit I've behaved badly to you over\nthis. But sometimes one has no choice. And in future I must take my own\nline.\"\n\nPoirot nodded his head several times.\n\n\"I understand,\" he said. The mocking light had quite died out of his\neyes, and he spoke with a sincerity and kindness that surprised me. \"It\nis that, my friend, is it not? It is love that has come--not as you\nimagined it, all cock a hoop with fine feathers, but sadly, with\nbleeding feet. Well, well--I warned you. When I realized that this girl\nmust have taken the dagger, I warned you. Perhaps you remember. But\nalready it was too late. But, tell me, how much do you know?\"\n\nI met his eyes squarely.\n\n\"Nothing that you could tell me would be any surprise to me, Poirot.", "Understand that. But in case you think of resuming your search for Miss\nDuveen, I should like you to know one thing clearly. If you have any\nidea that she was concerned in the crime, or was the mysterious lady\nwho called upon Mr. Renauld that night, you are wrong. I travelled home\nfrom France with her that day, and parted from her at Victoria that\nevening so that it is clearly impossible for her to have been in\nMerlinville.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Poirot looked at me thoughtfully. \"And you would swear to that in\na court of law?\"\n\n\"Most certainly I would.\"\n\nPoirot rose and bowed.\n\n\"_Mon ami! Vive l'amour!___ It can perform miracles. It is decidedly\ningenious what you have thought of there. It defeats even Hercule\nPoirot!\"\n\nAfter a moment of stress, such as I have just described, reaction is\nbound to set in. I retired to rest that night on a note of triumph, but\nI awoke to realize that I was by no means out of the wood. True, I\ncould see no flaw in the alibi I had so suddenly conceived. I had but\nto stick to my story, and I failed to see how Bella could be convicted\nin face of it. It was not as though there was any old friendship\nbetween us that could be raked up, and which might lead them to suspect\nthat I was committing perjury. It could be proved that in actual fact I\nhad only seen the girl on three occasions. No, I was still satisfied\nwith my idea--had not even Poirot admitted that it defeated him?\n\nBut there I felt the need of treading warily. All very well for my\nlittle friend to admit himself momentarily nonplussed. I had far too\nmuch respect for his abilities to conceive of him as being content to\nremain in that position. I had a very humble opinion of my wits when it\ncame to matching them against his. Poirot would not take defeat lying\ndown. Somehow or other, he would endeavour to turn the tables on me,\nand that in the way, and at the moment, when I least expected it.", "We met at breakfast the following morning as though nothing had\nhappened. Poirot's good temper was imperturbable, yet I thought I\ndetected a film of reserve in his manner which was new. After\nbreakfast, I announced my intention of going out for a stroll. A\nmalicious gleam shot through Poirot's eyes.\n\n\"If it is information you seek, you need not be at the pains of\nderanging yourself. I can tell you all you wish to know. The Dulcibella\nSisters have cancelled their contract, and have left Coventry for an\nunknown destination.\"\n\n\"Is that really so, Poirot?\"\n\n\"You can take it from me, Hastings. I made inquiries the first thing\nthis morning. After all, what else did you expect?\"\n\nTrue enough, nothing else could be expected under the circumstances.\nCinderella had profited by the slight start I had been able to assure\nher, and would certainly not lose a moment in removing herself from the\nreach of the pursuer. It was what I had intended and planned.\nNevertheless, I was aware of being plunged into a network of fresh\ndifficulties.\n\nI had absolutely no means of communicating with the girl, and it was\nvital that she should know the line of defence that had occurred to me,\nand which I was prepared to carry out. Of course it was possible that\nshe might try to send word to me in some way or another, but I hardly\nthought it likely. She would know the risk she ran of a message being\nintercepted by Poirot, thus setting him on her track once more. Clearly\nher only course was to disappear utterly for the time being.\n\nBut, in the meantime, what was Poirot doing? I studied him attentively.\nHe was wearing his most innocent air, and staring meditatively into the\nfar distance. He looked altogether too placid and supine to give me\nreassurance. I had learned, with Poirot, that the less dangerous he\nlooked, the more dangerous he was. His quiescence alarmed me. Observing\na troubled quality in my glance, he smiled benignantly.\n\n\"You are puzzled, Hastings? You ask yourself why I do not launch myself\nin pursuit?\"", "\"Well--something of the kind.\"\n\n\"It is what you would do, were you in my place. I understand that. But\nI am not of those who enjoy rushing up and down a country seeking a\nneedle in a haystack, as you English say. No--let Mademoiselle Bella\nDuveen go. Without doubt, I shall be able to find her when the time\ncomes. Until then, I am content to wait.\"\n\nI stared at him doubtfully. Was he seeking to mislead me? I had an\nirritating feeling that, even now, he was master of the situation. My\nsense of superiority was gradually waning. I had contrived the girl's\nescape, and evolved a brilliant scheme for saving her from the\nconsequences of her rash act--but I could not rest easy in my mind.\nPoirot's perfect calm awakened a thousand apprehensions.\n\n\"I suppose, Poirot,\" I said rather diffidently, \"I mustn't ask what\nyour plans are? I've forfeited the right.\"\n\n\"But not at all. There is no secret about them. We return to France\nwithout delay.\"\n\n\"_We?___\"\n\n\"Precisely--'_we!___' You know very well that you cannot afford to let\nPapa Poirot out of your sight. Eh, is it not so, my friend? But remain\nin England by all means if you wish--\"\n\nI shook my head. He had hit the nail on the head. I could not afford to\nlet him out of my sight. Although I could not expect his confidence\nafter what had happened, I could still check his actions. The only\ndanger to Bella lay with him. Giraud and the French police were\nindifferent to her existence. At all costs I must keep near Poirot.\n\nPoirot observed me attentively as these reflections passed through my\nmind, and gave a nod of satisfaction.\n\n\"I am right, am I not? And as you are quite capable of trying to follow\nme, disguised with some absurdity such as a false beard--which every one\nwould perceive, _bien entendu___--I much prefer that we should voyage\ntogether. It would annoy me greatly that any one should mock themselves\nat you.\"\n\n\"Very well, then. But it's only fair to warn you--\"\n\n\"I know--I know all.", "You are my enemy! Be my enemy then. It does not\nworry me at all.\"\n\n\"So long as it's all fair and above-board, I don't mind.\"\n\n\"You have to the full the English passion for 'fair-play!' Now your\nscruples are satisfied, let us depart immediately. There is no time to\nbe lost. Our stay in England has been short but sufficient. I know--what\nI wanted to know.\"\n\nThe tone was light, but I read a veiled menace into the words.\n\n\"Still--\" I began, and stopped.\n\n\"Still--as you say! Without doubt you are satisfied with the part you\nare playing. Me, I preoccupy myself with Jack Renauld.\"\n\nJack Renauld! The words gave me a start. I had completely forgotten\nthat aspect of the case. Jack Renauld, in prison, with the shadow of\nthe guillotine looming over him! I saw the part I was playing in a more\nsinister light. I could save Bella--yes, but in doing so I ran the risk\nof sending an innocent man to his death.\n\nI pushed the thought from me with horror. It could not be. He would be\nacquitted. Certainly he would be acquitted! But the cold fear came\nback. Suppose he were not? What then? Could I have it on my\nconscience--horrible thought! Would it come to that in the end? A\ndecision. Bella or Jack Renauld? The promptings of my heart were to\nsave the girl I loved at any cost to myself. But, if the cost were to\nanother, the problem was altered.\n\nWhat would the girl herself say? I remembered that no word of Jack\nRenauld's arrest had passed my lips. As yet she was in total ignorance\nof the fact that her former lover was in prison charged with a hideous\ncrime which he had not committed. When she knew, how would she act?\nWould she permit her life to be saved at the expense of his? Certainly\nshe must do nothing rash. Jack Renauld might, and probably would, be\nacquitted without any intervention on her part. If so, good. But if he\nwas not.", "... That was the terrible, the unanswerable problem. I fancied\nthat she ran no risk of the extreme penalty. The circumstances of the\ncrime were quite different in her case. She could plead jealousy and\nextreme provocation, and her youth and beauty would go for much. The\nfact that by a tragic mistake it was old Mr. Renauld, and not his son,\nwho paid the penalty would not alter the motive of the crime. But in\nany case, however lenient the sentence of the Court, it must mean a\nlong term of imprisonment.\n\nNo, Bella must be protected. And, at the same time, Jack Renauld must\nbe saved. How this was to be accomplished I did not see clearly. But I\npinned my faith to Poirot. He knew. Come what might, he would manage to\nsave an innocent man. He must find some pretext other than the real\none. It might be difficult, but he would manage it somehow. And with\nBella unsuspected, and Jack Renauld acquitted, all would end\nsatisfactorily.\n\nSo I told myself repeatedly, but at the bottom of my heart there still\nremained a cold fear.\n\n\n\n24 \"Save Him!\"\n\nWe crossed from England by the evening boat, and the following morning\nsaw us in Saint-Omer, whither Jack Renauld had been taken. Poirot lost\nno time in visiting M. Hautet. As he did not seem disposed to make any\nobjections to my accompanying him, I bore him company.\n\nAfter various formalities and preliminaries, we were conducted to the\nexamining magistrate's room. He greeted us cordially.\n\n\"I was told that you had returned to England, M. Poirot. I am glad to\nfind that such is not the case.\"\n\n\"It is true that I went there, M. le juge, but it was only for a flying\nvisit. A side issue, but one that I fancied might repay investigation.\"\n\n\"And it did--eh?\"\n\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders. M. Hautet nodded, sighing.\n\n\"We must resign ourselves, I fear. That animal Giraud, his manners are\nabominable, but he is undoubtedly clever! Not much chance of that one\nmaking a mistake.\"\n\n\"You think not, M. le juge?\"", "It was the examining magistrate's turn to shrug his shoulders.\n\n\"_Eh bien___, speaking frankly--in confidence, _c'est entendu___--can you\ncome to any other conclusion?\"\n\n\"Frankly, M. le juge, there seem to me to be many points that are\nobscure.\"\n\n\"Such as--?\"\n\nBut Poirot was not to be drawn.\n\n\"I have not yet tabulated them,\" he remarked. \"It was a general\nreflection that I was making. I liked the young man, and should be\nsorry to believe him guilty of such a hideous crime. By the way, what\nhas he to say for himself on the matter?\"\n\nThe magistrate frowned.\n\n\"I cannot understand him. He seems incapable of putting up any sort of\ndefence. It has been most difficult to get him to answer questions. He\ncontents himself with a general denial, and beyond that takes refuge in\na most obstinate silence. I am interrogating him again tomorrow;\nperhaps you would like to be present?\"\n\nWe accepted the invitation with _empressement___.\n\n\"A distressing case,\" said the magistrate with a sigh. \"My sympathy for\nMadame Renauld is profound.\"\n\n\"How is Madame Renauld?\"\n\n\"She has not yet recovered consciousness. It is merciful in a way, poor\nwoman, she is being spared much. The doctors say that there is no\ndanger, but that when she comes to herself she must be kept as quiet as\npossible. It was, I understand, quite as much the shock as the fall\nwhich caused her present state. It would be terrible if her brain\nbecame unhinged; but I should not wonder at all--no, really, not at\nall.\"\n\nM. Hautet leaned back, shaking his head, with a sort of mournful\nenjoyment, as he envisaged the gloomy prospect.\n\nHe roused himself at length, and observed with a start.\n\n\"That reminds me. I have here a letter for you, M. Poirot. Let me see,\nwhere did I put it?\"\n\nHe proceeded to rummage amongst his papers. At last he found the\nmissive, and handed it to Poirot.\n\n\"It was sent under cover to me in order that I might forward it to\nyou,\" he explained. \"But as you left no address I could not do so.\"", "Poirot studied the letter curiously. It was addressed in a long,\nsloping, foreign hand, and the writing was decidedly a woman's. Poirot\ndid not open it. Instead he put it in his pocket and rose to his feet.\n\n\"_A demain___ then, M. le juge. Many thanks for your courtesy and\namiability.\"\n\n\"But not at all. I am always at your service. These young detectives of\nthe school of Giraud, they are all alike--rude, sneering fellows. They\ndo not realize that an examining magistrate of my--er--experience is\nbound to have a certain discernment, a certain--_flair___. _Enfin!___\nthe politeness of the old school is infinitely more to my taste.\nTherefore, my dear friend, command me in any way you will. We know a\nthing or two, you and I--eh?\"\n\nAnd laughing heartily, enchanted with himself and with us, M. Hautet\nbade us adieu. I am sorry to have to record that Poirot's first remark\nto me as we traversed the corridor was:\n\n\"A famous old imbecile, that one! Of a stupidity to make pity!\"\n\nWe were just leaving the building when we came face to face with\nGiraud, looking more dandified than ever, and thoroughly pleased with\nhimself.\n\n\"Aha! M. Poirot,\" he cried airily. \"You have returned from England\nthen?\"\n\n\"As you see,\" said Poirot.\n\n\"The end of the case is not far off now, I fancy.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, M. Giraud.\"\n\nPoirot spoke in a subdued tone. His crest-fallen manner seemed to\ndelight the other.\n\n\"Of all the milk and water criminals! Not an idea of defending himself.\nIt is extraordinary!\"\n\n\"So extraordinary that it gives one to think, does it not?\" suggested\nPoirot mildly.\n\nBut Giraud was not even listening. He twirled his cane amicably.\n\n\"Well, good day, M. Poirot. I am glad you're satisfied of young\nRenauld's guilt at last.\"\n\n\"_Pardon!___ But I am not in the least satisfied. Jack Renauld is\ninnocent.\"\n\nGiraud stared for a moment--then burst out laughing, tapping his head\nsignificantly with the brief remark: \"_Toque!___\"\n\nPoirot drew himself up. A dangerous light showed in his eyes.", "\"M. Giraud, throughout the case your manner to me has been deliberately\ninsulting! You need teaching a lesson. I am prepared to wager you 500\nfrancs that I find the murderer of M. Renauld before you do. Is it\nagreed?\"\n\nGiraud stared helplessly at him, and murmured again:\n\n\"_Toque!___\"\n\n\"Come now,\" urged Poirot, \"is it agreed?\"\n\n\"I have no wish to take your money from you.\"\n\n\"Make your mind easy--you will not!\"\n\n\"Oh, well then, I agree! You speak of my manner to you being insulting.\n_Eh bien___, once or twice, _your___ manner has annoyed _me___.\"\n\n\"I am enchanted to hear it,\" said Poirot. \"Good morning, M. Giraud.\nCome, Hastings.\"\n\nI said no word as we walked along the street. My heart was heavy.\nPoirot had displayed his intentions only too plainly. I doubted more\nthan ever my powers of saving Bella from the consequences of her act.\nThis unlucky encounter with Giraud had roused Poirot and put him on his\nmettle.\n\nSuddenly I felt a hand laid on my shoulder, and turned to face Gabriel\nStonor. We stopped and greeted him, and he proposed strolling with us\nback to our hotel.\n\n\"And what are you doing here, M. Stonor?\" inquired Poirot.\n\n\"One must stand by one's friends,\" replied the other dryly. \"Especially\nwhen they are unjustly accused.\"\n\n\"Then you do not believe that Jack Renauld committed the crime?\" I\nasked eagerly.\n\n\"Certainly I don't. I know the lad. I admit that there have been one or\ntwo things in this business that have staggered me completely, but none\nthe less, in spite of his fool way of taking it, I'll never believe\nthat Jack Renauld is a murderer.\"\n\nMy heart warmed to the secretary. His words seemed to lift a secret\nweight from my heart.\n\n\"I have no doubt that many people feel as you do,\" I exclaimed. \"There\nis really absurdly little evidence against him. I should say that there\nwas no doubt of his acquittal--no doubt whatever.\"\n\nBut Stonor hardly responded as I could have wished.\n\n\"I'd give a lot to think as you do,\" he said gravely.", "He turned to\nPoirot. \"What's your opinion, monsieur?\"\n\n\"I think that things look very black against him,\" said Poirot quietly.\n\n\"You believe him guilty?\" said Stonor sharply.\n\n\"No. But I think he will find it hard to prove his innocence.\"\n\n\"He's behaving so damned queerly,\" muttered Stonor. \"Of course I\nrealize that there's a lot more in this affair than meets the eye.\nGiraud's not wise to that because he's an outsider, but the whole thing\nhas been damned odd. As to that, least said soonest mended. If Mrs.\nRenauld wants to hush anything up, I'll take my cue from her. It's her\nshow, and I've too much respect for her judgment to shove my oar in,\nbut I can't get behind this attitude of Jack's. Any one would think he\n_wanted___ to be thought guilty.\"\n\n\"But it's absurd,\" I cried, bursting in. \"For one thing, the dagger--\" I\npaused, uncertain as to how much Poirot would wish me to reveal. I\ncontinued, choosing my words carefully, \"We know that the dagger could\nnot have been in Jack Renauld's possession that evening. Mrs. Renauld\nknows that.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Stonor. \"When she recovers, she will doubtless say all\nthis and more. Well, I must be leaving you.\"\n\n\"One moment.\" Poirot's hand arrested his departure. \"Can you arrange\nfor word to be sent to me at once should Madame Renauld recover\nconsciousness?\"\n\n\"Certainly. That's easily done.\"\n\n\"That point about the dagger is good, Poirot,\" I urged as we went\nupstairs. \"I couldn't speak very plainly before Stonor.\"\n\n\"That was quite right of you. We might as well keep the knowledge to\nourselves as long as we can. As to the dagger, your point hardly helps\nJack Renauld. You remember that I was absent for an hour this morning,\nbefore we started from London?\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Well, I was employed in trying to find the firm Jack Renauld employed\nto convert his souvenirs. It was not very difficult. _Eh bien___,\nHastings, they made to his order not _two___ paper-knives, but\n_three___.\"\n\n\"So that--?\"\n\n\"So that, after giving one to his mother, and one to Bella Duveen,\nthere was a third which he doubtless retained for his own use.", "No,\nHastings, I fear the dagger question will not help us to save him from\nthe guillotine.\"\n\n\"It won't come to that,\" I cried, stung.\n\nPoirot shook his head uncertainly.\n\n\"You will save him,\" I cried positively.\n\nPoirot glanced at me dryly.\n\n\"Have you not rendered it impossible, _mon ami?___\"\n\n\"Some other way,\" I muttered.\n\n\"Ah! _Sapristi!___ But it is miracles you ask from me. No--say no more.\nLet us instead see what is in this letter.\"\n\nAnd he drew out the envelope from his breast pocket.\n\nHis face contracted as he read, then he handed the one flimsy sheet to\nme.\n\n\"There are other women in the world who suffer, Hastings.\"\n\nThe writing was blurred and the note had evidently been written in\ngreat agitation:\n\n\"_Dear M. Poirot:___\n\"If you get this, I beg of you to come to my aid. I have no one to turn\nto, and at all costs Jack must be saved. I implore of you on my knees\nto help us.\n\n\n\"MARTHE DAUBREUIL.\"\n\n\nI handed it back, moved.\n\n\"You will go?\"\n\n\"At once. We will command an auto.\"\n\nHalf an hour later saw us at the Villa Marguerite. Marthe was at the\ndoor to meet us, and led Poirot in, clinging with both hands to one of\nhis.\n\n\"Ah, you have come--it is good of you. I have been in despair, not\nknowing what to do. They will not let me go to see him in prison even.\nI suffer horribly, I am nearly mad. Is it true what they say, that he\ndoes not deny the crime? But that is madness. It is impossible that he\nshould have done it! Never for one minute will I believe it.\"\n\n\"Neither do I believe it, mademoiselle,\" said Poirot gently.\n\n\"But then why does he not speak? I do not understand.\"\n\n\"Perhaps because he is screening some one,\" suggested Poirot, watching\nher.\n\nMarthe frowned.\n\n\"Screening some one? Do you mean his mother? Ah, from the beginning I\nhave suspected her. Who inherits all that vast fortune? She does. It is\neasy to wear widow's weeds and play the hypocrite.", "And they say that\nwhen he was arrested she fell down--like _that___.\" She made a dramatic\ngesture. \"And without doubt, M. Stonor, the secretary, he helped her.\nThey are thick as thieves, those two. It is true she is older than\nhe--but what do men care--if a woman is rich!\"\n\nThere was a hint of bitterness in her tone.\n\n\"Stonor was in England,\" I put in.\n\n\"He says so--but who knows?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said Poirot quietly, \"if we are to work together, you\nand I, we must have things clear. First, I will ask you a question.\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Are you aware of your mother's real name?\"\n\nMarthe looked at him for a minute, then, letting her head fall forward\non her arms, she burst into tears.\n\n\"There, there,\" said Poirot, patting her on the shoulder. \"Calm\nyourself, _petite___, I see that you know. Now a second question, did\nyou know who M. Renauld was?\"\n\n\"M. Renauld,\" she raised her head from her hands and gazed at him\nwonderingly.\n\n\"Ah, I see you do not know that. Now listen to me carefully.\"\n\nStep by step, he went over the case, much as he had done to me on the\nday of our departure for England. Marthe listened spellbound. When he\nhad finished, she drew a long breath.\n\n\"But you are wonderful--magnificent! You are the greatest detective in\nthe world.\"\n\nWith a swift gesture she slipped off her chair and knelt before him\nwith an abandonment that was wholly French.\n\n\"Save him, monsieur,\" she cried. \"I love him so. Oh, save him, save\nhim--save him!\"\n\nWe were present the following morning at the examination of Jack\nRenauld. Short as the time had been, I was shocked at the change that\nhad taken place in the young prisoner. His cheeks had fallen in, there\nwere deep black circles round his eyes, and he looked haggard and\ndistraught, as one who had wooed sleep in vain for several nights. He\nbetrayed no emotion at seeing us.\n\nThe prisoner and his counsel, Maitre Grosier, were accommodated with\nchairs. A formidable guard with resplendent sabre stood before the\ndoor.", "The patient _greffier___ sat at his desk. The examination began.\n\n\"Renauld,\" began the magistrate, \"do you deny that you were in\nMerlinville on the night of the crime?\"\n\nJack did not reply at once, then he said with a hesitancy of manner\nwhich was piteous:\n\n\"I--I--told you that I was in Cherbourg.\"\n\nMaitre Grosier frowned and sighed. I realized at once that Jack Renauld\nwas obstinately bent on conducting his own case as he wished, to the\ndespair of his legal representative.\n\nThe magistrate turned sharply.\n\n\"Send in the station witnesses.\"\n\nIn a moment or two the door opened to admit a man whom I recognized as\nbeing a porter at Merlinville station.\n\n\"You were on duty on the night of June 7th?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"You witnessed the arrival of the 11:40 train?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Look at the prisoner. Do you recognize him as having been one of the\npassengers to alight?\"\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur le juge.\"\n\n\"There is no possibility of your being mistaken?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur. I knew M. Jack Renauld well.\"\n\n\"Nor of your being mistaken as to the date?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur. Because it was the following morning, June 8th, that we\nheard of the murder.\"\n\nAnother railway official was brought in, and confirmed the first one's\nevidence. The magistrate looked at Jack Renauld.\n\n\"These men have identified you positively. What have you to say?\"\n\nJack shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nM. Hautet exchanged a glance with the _greffier___, as the scratching\nof the latter's pen recorded the answer.\n\n\"Renauld,\" continued the magistrate, \"do you recognize this?\"\n\nHe took something from the table by his side, and held it out to the\nprisoner. I shuddered as I recognized the aeroplane dagger.\n\n\"Pardon,\" cried Maitre Grosier. \"I demand to speak to my client before\nhe answers that question.\"\n\nBut Jack Renauld had no consideration for the feelings of the wretched\nGrosier. He waved him aside, and replied quietly:\n\n\"Certainly I recognize it. It is a present given by me to my mother, as\na souvenir of the War.\"\n\n\"Is there, as far as you know, any duplicate of that dagger in\nexistence?\"", "Again Maitre Grosier burst out, and again Jack overrode him.\n\n\"Not that I know of. The setting was my own design.\"\n\nEven the magistrate almost gasped at the boldness of the reply. It did,\nin very truth, seem as though Jack was rushing on his fate. I realized,\nof course, the vital necessity he was under of concealing, for Bella's\nsake, the fact that there was a duplicate dagger in the case. So long\nas there was supposed to be only one weapon, no suspicion was likely to\nattach to the girl who had had the second paper-knife in her\npossession. He was valiantly shielding the woman he had once loved--but\nat what a cost to himself! I began to realize the magnitude of the task\nI had so lightly set Poirot. It would not be easy to secure the\nacquittal of Jack Renauld, by anything short of the truth.\n\nM. Hautet spoke again, with a peculiarly biting inflection:\n\n\"Madame Renauld told us that this dagger was on her dressing table on\nthe night of the crime. But Madame Renauld is a mother! It will\ndoubtless astonish you, Renauld, but I consider it highly likely that\nMadame Renauld was mistaken, and that, by inadvertence perhaps, you had\ntaken it with you to Paris. Doubtless you will contradict me--\"\n\nI saw the lad's handcuffed hands clench themselves. The perspiration\nstood out in beads upon his brow, as with a supreme effort he\ninterrupted M. Hautet in a hoarse voice:\n\n\"I shall not contradict you. It is possible.\"\n\nIt was a stupefying moment. Maitre Grosier rose to his feet,\nprotesting:\n\n\"My client has undergone a considerable nervous strain. I should wish\nit put on record that I do not consider him answerable for what he\nsays.\"\n\nThe magistrate quelled him angrily. For a moment a doubt seemed to\narise in his own mind. Jack Renauld had almost overdone his part. He\nleaned forward, and gazed at the prisoner searchingly.\n\n\"Do you fully understand, Renauld, that on the answers you have given\nme I shall have no alternative but to commit you for trial?\"", "Jack's pale face flushed. He looked steadily back.\n\n\"M. Hautet, I swear that I did not kill my father.\"\n\nBut the magistrate's brief moment of doubt was over. He laughed a\nshort, unpleasant laugh.\n\n\"Without doubt, without doubt--they are always innocent, our prisoners!\nBy your own mouth you are condemned. You can offer no defence, no\nalibi--only a mere assertion which would not deceive a babe!--that you\nare not guilty. You killed your father, Renauld--cruel and cowardly\nmurder--for the sake of money which you believed would come to you at\nhis death. Your mother was an accessory after the fact. Doubtless, in\nview of the fact that she acted as a mother, the courts will extend an\nindulgence to her that they will not accord to you. And rightly so!\nYour crime was a horrible one--to be held in abhorrence by gods and\nmen!\" M. Hautet was enjoying himself, working up his period, steeped in\nthe solemnity of the moment, and his own role as representative of\njustice. \"You killed--and you must pay the consequences of your action.\nI speak to you, not as a man, but as Justice, eternal Justice, which--\"\n\nM. Hautet was interrupted--to his intense annoyance. The door was pushed\nopen.\n\n\"M. le juge, M. le juge,\" stammered the attendant, \"there is a lady who\nsays--who says--\"\n\n\"Who says what?\" cried the justly incensed magistrate. \"This is highly\nirregular. I forbid it--I absolutely forbid it.\"\n\nBut a slender figure pushed the stammering gendarme aside. Dressed all\nin black, with a long veil that hid her face, she advanced into the\nroom.\n\nMy heart gave a sickening throb. She had come then! All my efforts were\nin vain. Yet I could not but admire the courage that had led her to\ntake this step so unfalteringly.\n\nShe raised her veil--and I gasped. For, though as like her as two peas,\nthis girl was not Cinderella! On the other hand, now that I saw her\nwithout the fair wig she had worn on the stage, I recognized her as the\ngirl of the photograph in Jack Renauld's room.", "\"You are the Juge d'Instruction, M. Hautet?\" she queried.\n\n\"Yes, but I forbid--\"\n\n\"My name is Bella Duveen. I wish to give myself up for the murder of\nMr. Renauld.\"\n\n\"_My Friend:___\n    \"You will know all when you get this. Nothing that I can say will\n    move Bella. She has gone out to give herself up. I am tired out\n    with struggling.\n    \"You will know now that I deceived you, that where you gave me\n    trust I repaid you with lies. It will seem, perhaps, indefensible\n    to you, but I should like, before I go out of your life for ever,\n    to show you just how it all came about. If I knew that you forgave\n    me, it would make life easier for me. It wasn't for myself I did\n    it--that's the only thing I can put forward to say for myself.\n    \"I'll begin from the day I met you in the boat train from Paris. I\n    was uneasy then about Bella. She was just desperate about Jack\n    Renauld, she'd have lain down on the ground for him to walk on, and\n    when he began to change, and to stop writing so often, she began\n    getting in a state. She got it into her head that he was keen on\n    another girl--and of course, as it turned out afterwards, she was\n    quite right there. She'd made up her mind to go to their Villa at\n    Merlinville, and try and see Jack. She knew I was against it, and\n    tried to give me the slip. I found she was not on the train at\n    Calais, and determined I would not go on to England without her.\n    I'd an uneasy feeling that something awful was going to happen if I\n    couldn't prevent it.\n    \"I met the next train from Paris. She was on it, and set upon going\n    out then and there to Merlinville. I argued with her for all I was\n    worth, but it wasn't any good. She was all strung up and set upon\n    having her own way. Well, I washed my hands of it. I'd done all I\n    could!", "It was getting late. I went to an hotel, and Bella started\n    for Merlinville. I still couldn't shake off my feeling of what the\n    books call 'impending disaster.'\n    \"The next day came--but no Bella. She'd made a date with me to meet\n    at the hotel, but she didn't keep it. No sign of her all day. I got\n    more and more anxious. Then came an evening paper with the news.\n    \"It was awful! I couldn't be sure, of course--but I was terribly\n    afraid. I figured it out that Bella had met Papa Renauld and told\n    him about her and Jack, and that he'd insulted her or something\n    like that. We've both got terribly quick tempers.\n    \"Then all the masked foreigner business came out, and I began to\n    feel more at ease. But it still worried me that Bella hadn't kept\n    her date with me.\n    \"By the next morning, I was so rattled that I'd just got to go and\n    see what I could. First thing, I ran up against you. You know all\n    that ... When I saw the dead man, looking so like Jack, and wearing\n    Jack's fancy overcoat, I knew! And there was the identical\n    paper-knife--wicked little thing!--that Jack had given Bella! Ten to\n    one it had her finger-marks on it. I can't hope to explain to you\n    the sort of helpless horror of that moment. I only saw one thing\n    clearly--I must get hold of that dagger, and get right away with it\n    before they found out it was gone. I pretended to faint, and whilst\n    you were away getting water I took the thing and hid it away in my\n    dress.\n    \"I told you that I was staying at the Hotel du Phare, but of course\n    really I made a bee line back to Calais, and then on to England by\n    the first boat. When we were in mid-Channel, I dropped that little\n    devil of a dagger into the sea. Then I felt I could breathe again.\n    \"Bella was at our digs in London. She looked like nothing on God's\n    earth.", "I told her what I'd done, and that she was pretty safe for\n    the time being. She stared at me, and then began laughing ...\n    laughing ... laughing ... it was horrible to hear her! I felt that the\n    best thing to do was to keep busy. She'd go mad if she had time to\n    brood on what she'd done. Luckily we got an engagement at once.\n    \"And then, I saw you and your friend, watching us that night ... I\n    was frantic. You must suspect, or you wouldn't have tracked us\n    down. I had to know the worst, so I followed you. I was desperate.\n    And then, before I'd had time to say anything, I tumbled to it that\n    it was _me___ you suspected, not Bella! Or at least that you\n    thought I _was___ Bella since I'd stolen the dagger.\n    \"I wish, honey, that you could see back into my mind at that\n    moment ... you'd forgive me, perhaps ... I was so frightened, and\n    muddled, and desperate. ... All I could get clearly was that you\n    would try and save me. I didn't know whether you'd be willing to\n    save her ... I thought very likely not--it wasn't the same thing! And\n    I couldn't risk it! Bella's my twin--I'd got to do the best for her.\n    So I went on lying. ... I felt mean--I feel mean still. ... That's\n    all--enough too, you'll say, I expect. I ought to have trusted\n    you. ... If I had--\n    \"As soon as the news was in the paper that Jack Renauld had been\n    arrested, it was all up. Bella wouldn't even wait to see how things\n    went. ...\n    \"I'm very tired. ... I can't write any more. ...\"\n\n\nShe had begun to sign herself Cinderella, but had crossed that out and\nwritten instead \"Dulcie Duveen.\"\n\nIt was an ill-written, blurred epistle but I have kept it to this day.\n\nPoirot was with me when I read it. The sheets fell from my hand, and I\nlooked across at him.\n\n\"Did you know all the time that it was--the other?\"\n\n\"Yes, my friend.\"\n\n\"Why did you not tell me?\"\n\n\"To begin with, I could hardly believe it conceivable that you could\nmake such a mistake.", "You had seen the photograph. The sisters are very\nalike, but by no means incapable of distinguishment.\"\n\n\"But the fair hair?\"\n\n\"A wig, worn for the sake of a piquant contrast on the stage. Is it\nconceivable that with twins one should be fair and one dark?\"\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me that night at the hotel in Coventry?\"\n\n\"You were rather high-handed in your methods, _mon ami___,\" said Poirot\ndryly. \"You did not give me a chance.\"\n\n\"But afterwards?\"\n\n\"Ah, afterwards! Well, to begin with, I was hurt at your want of faith\nin me. And then, I wanted to see whether your--feelings would stand the\ntest of time. In fact, whether it was love, or a flash in the pan, with\nyou. I should not have left you long in your error.\"\n\nI nodded. His tone was too affectionate for me to bear resentment. I\nlooked down on the sheets of the letter. Suddenly I picked them up from\nthe floor, and pushed them across to him.\n\n\"Read that,\" I said. \"I'd like you to.\"\n\nHe read it through in silence, then he looked up at me.\n\n\"What is it that worries you, Hastings?\"\n\nThis was quite a new mood in Poirot. His mocking manner seemed laid\nquite aside. I was able to say what I wanted without too much\ndifficulty.\n\n\"She doesn't say--she doesn't say--well, not whether she cares for me or\nnot!\"\n\nPoirot turned back the pages.\n\n\"I think you are mistaken, Hastings.\"\n\n\"Where?\" I cried, leaning forward eagerly.\n\nPoirot smiled.\n\n\"She tells you that in every line of the letter, _mon ami___.\"\n\n\"But where am I to find her? There's no address on the letter. There's\na French stamp, that's all.\"\n\n\"Excite yourself not! Leave it to Papa Poirot. I can find her for you\nas soon as I have five little minutes!\"\n\n\"Congratulations, M. Jack,\" said Poirot, wringing the lad warmly by the\nhand.\n\nYoung Renauld had come to us as soon as he was liberated--before\nstarting for Merlinville to rejoin Marthe and his mother. Stonor\naccompanied him. His heartiness was in strong contrast to the lad's wan\nlooks.", "It was plain that the boy was on the verge of a nervous\nbreakdown. Although delivered from the immediate peril that was hanging\nover him, the circumstances of his release were too painful to let him\nfeel full relief. He smiled mournfully at Poirot, and said in a low\nvoice:\n\n\"I went through it to protect her, and now it's all no use!\"\n\n\"You could hardly expect the girl to accept the price of your life,\"\nremarked Stonor dryly. \"She was bound to come forward when she saw you\nheading straight for the guillotine.\"\n\n\"_Eh ma foi!___ and you were heading for it too!\" added Poirot, with a\nslight twinkle. \"You would have had Maitre Grosier's death from rage on\nyour conscience if you had gone on.\"\n\n\"He was a well meaning ass, I suppose,\" said Jack. \"But he worried me\nhorribly. You see, I couldn't very well take him into my confidence.\nBut, my God! what's going to happen about Bella?\"\n\n\"If I were you,\" said Poirot frankly, \"I should not distress myself\nunduly. The French Courts are very lenient to youth and beauty, and the\n_crime passionnel___. A clever lawyer will make out a great case of\nextenuating circumstances. It will not be pleasant for you--\"\n\n\"I don't care about that. You see, M. Poirot, in a way I _do___ feel\nguilty of my father's murder. But for me, and my entanglement with this\ngirl, he would be alive and well today. And then my cursed carelessness\nin taking away the wrong overcoat. I can't help feeling responsible for\nhis death. It will haunt me for ever!\"\n\n\"No, no,\" I said soothingly.\n\n\"Of course it's horrible to me to think that Bella killed my father,\"\nresumed Jack, \"but I'd treated her shamefully. After I met Marthe, and\nrealized I'd made a mistake, I ought to have written and told her so\nhonestly. But I was so terrified of a row, and of its coming to\nMarthe's ears, and her thinking there was more in it than there ever\nhad been, that--well, I was a coward, and went on hoping the thing would\ndie down of itself.", "I just drifted, in fact--not realizing that I was\ndriving the poor kid desperate. If she'd really knifed me, as she meant\nto, I should have got no more than my deserts. And the way she's come\nforward now is downright plucky. I'd have stood the racket, you know--up\nto the end.\"\n\nHe was silent for a moment or two, and then burst out on another tack:\n\n\"What gets me is why the Governor should be wandering about in\nunderclothes and my overcoat at that time of night. I suppose he'd just\ngiven the foreign johnnies the slip, and my mother must have made a\nmistake about its being 2 o'clock when they came. Or--or, it wasn't all\na frame up, was it? I mean, my mother didn't think--couldn't\nthink--that--that it was _me?___\"\n\nPoirot reassured him quickly.\n\n\"No, no, M. Jack. Have no fears on that score. As for the rest, I will\nexplain it to you one of these days. It is rather curious. But will you\nrecount to us exactly what did occur on that terrible evening?\"\n\n\"There's very little to tell. I came from Cherbourg, as I told you, in\norder to see Marthe before going to the other end of the world. The\ntrain was late, and I decided to take the short cut across the golf\nlinks. I could easily get into the grounds of the Villa Marguerite from\nthere. I had nearly reached the place when--\"\n\nHe paused and swallowed.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I heard a terrible cry. It wasn't loud--a sort of choke and gasp--but it\nfrightened me. For a moment I stood rooted to the spot. Then I came\nround the corner of a bush. There was moonlight. I saw the grave, and a\nfigure lying face downwards, with a dagger sticking in the back. And\nthen--and then--I looked up and saw _her___. She was looking at me as\nthough she saw a ghost--it's what she must have thought me at first--all\nexpression seemed frozen out of her face by horror. And then she gave a\ncry, and turned and ran.\"", "He stopped, trying to master his emotion.\n\n\"And afterwards?\" asked Poirot gently.\n\n\"I really don't know. I stayed there for a time, dazed. And then I\nrealized I'd better get away as fast as I could. It didn't occur to me\nthat they would suspect me, but I was afraid of being called upon to\ngive evidence against her. I walked to St. Beauvais as I told you, and\ngot a car from there back to Cherbourg.\"\n\nA knock came at the door, and a page entered with a telegram which he\ndelivered to Stonor. He tore it open. Then he got up from his seat.\n\n\"Mrs. Renauld has regained consciousness,\" he said.\n\n\"Ah!\" Poirot sprang to his feet. \"Let us all go to Merlinville at\nonce!\"\n\nA hurried departure was made forthwith. Stonor, at Jack's instance,\nagreed to stay behind and do all that could be done for Bella Duveen.\nPoirot, Jack Renauld and I set off in the Renauld car.\n\nThe run took just over forty minutes. As we approached the doorway of\nthe Villa Marguerite, Jack Renauld shot a questioning glance at Poirot.\n\n\"How would it be if you went on first--to break the news to my mother\nthat I am free--\"\n\n\"While you break it in person to Mademoiselle Marthe, eh?\" finished\nPoirot, with a twinkle. \"But yes, by all means, I was about to propose\nsuch an arrangement myself.\"\n\nJack Renauld did not wait for more. Stopping the car, he swung himself\nout, and ran up the path to the front door. We went on in the car to\nthe Villa Genevieve.\n\n\"Poirot,\" I said, \"do you remember how we arrived here that first day?\nAnd were met by the news of M. Renauld's murder?\"\n\n\"Ah! yes, truly. Not so long ago, either. But what a lot of things have\nhappened since then--especially for you, _mon ami!___\"\n\n\"Poirot, what have you done about finding Bel--I mean Dulcie?\"\n\n\"Calm yourself, Hastings. I arrange everything.\"\n\n\"You're being a precious long time about it,\" I grumbled.\n\nPoirot changed the subject.\n\n\"Then the beginning, now the end,\" he moralized, as we rang the bell.", "\"And, considered as a case, the end is profoundly unsatisfactory.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" I sighed.\n\n\"You are regarding it from the sentimental standpoint, Hastings. That\nwas not my meaning. We will hope that Mademoiselle Bella will be dealt\nwith leniently, and after all Jack Renauld cannot marry both the girls.\nI spoke from a professional standpoint. This is not a crime well\nordered and regular, such as a detective delights in. The _mise en\nscene___ designed by Georges Conneau, that indeed is perfect, but the\n_denouement___--ah, no! A man killed by accident in a girl's fit of\nanger--ah, indeed, what order or method is there in that?\"\n\nAnd in the midst of a fit of laughter on my part at Poirot's\npeculiarities, the door was opened by Francoise.\n\nPoirot explained that he must see Mrs. Renauld at once, and the old\nwoman conducted him upstairs. I remained in the _salon___. It was some\ntime before Poirot reappeared. He was looking unusually grave.\n\n\"_Vous voila___, Hastings! _Sacre tonnerre___, but there are squalls\nahead!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I cried.\n\n\"I would hardly have credited it,\" said Poirot thoughtfully, \"but women\nare very unexpected.\"\n\n\"Here are Jack and Marthe Daubreuil,\" I exclaimed, looking out of the\nwindow.\n\nPoirot bounded out of the room, and met the young couple on the steps\noutside.\n\n\"Do not enter. It is better not. Your mother is very upset.\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" said Jack Renauld. \"I must go up to her at once.\"\n\n\"But no, I tell you. It is better not.\"\n\n\"But Marthe and I--\"\n\n\"In any case, do not take Mademoiselle with you. Mount, if you must,\nbut you would be wise to be guided by me.\"\n\nA voice on the stairs behind made us all start.\n\n\"I thank you for your good offices, M. Poirot, but I will make my own\nwishes clear.\"\n\nWe stared in astonishment. Descending the stairs, leaning upon Leonie's\narm, was Mrs. Renauld, her head still bandaged. The French girl was\nweeping, and imploring her mistress to return to bed.\n\n\"Madame will kill herself. It is contrary to all the doctor's orders!\"", "But Mrs. Renauld came on.\n\n\"Mother,\" cried Jack, starting forward. But with a gesture she drove\nhim back.\n\n\"I am no mother of yours! You are no son of mine! From this day and\nhour I renounce you.\"\n\n\"Mother,\" cried the lad, stupefied.\n\nFor a moment she seemed to waver, to falter before the anguish in his\nvoice. Poirot made a mediating gesture, but instantly she regained\ncommand of herself.\n\n\"Your father's blood is on your head. You are morally guilty of his\ndeath. You thwarted and defied him over this girl, and by your\nheartless treatment of another girl, you brought about his death. Go\nout from my house. Tomorrow I intend to take such steps as shall make\nit certain that you shall never touch a penny of his money. Make your\nway in the world as best you can with the help of the girl who is the\ndaughter of your father's bitterest enemy!\"\n\nAnd slowly, painfully, she retraced her way upstairs.\n\nWe were all dumbfounded--totally unprepared for such a demonstration.\nJack Renauld, worn out with all he had already gone through, swayed and\nnearly fell. Poirot and I went quickly to his assistance.\n\n\"He is overdone,\" murmured Poirot to Marthe. \"Where can we take him?\"\n\n\"But home! To the Villa Marguerite. We will nurse him, my mother and I.\nMy poor Jack!\"\n\nWe got the lad to the Villa, where he dropped limply on to a chair in a\nsemi-dazed condition. Poirot felt his head and hands.\n\n\"He has fever. The long strain begins to tell. And now this shock on\ntop of it. Get him to bed, and Hastings and I will summon a doctor.\"\n\nA doctor was soon procured. After examining the patient, he gave it as\nhis opinion that it was simply a case of nerve strain. With perfect\nrest and quiet, the lad might be almost restored by the next day, but,\nif excited, there was a chance of brain fever. It would be advisable\nfor some one to sit up all night with him.\n\nFinally, having done all we could, we left him in the charge of Marthe\nand her mother, and set out for the town.", "It was past our usual hour of\ndining, and we were both famished. The first restaurant we came to\nassuaged the pangs of hunger with an excellent _omelette___, and an\nequally excellent _entrecote___ to follow.\n\n\"And now for quarters for the night,\" said Poirot, when at length _cafe\nnoir___ had completed the meal. \"Shall we try our old friend, the Hotel\ndes Bains?\"\n\nWe traced our steps there without more ado. Yes, Messieurs could be\naccommodated with two good rooms overlooking the sea. Then Poirot asked\na question which surprised me.\n\n\"Has an English lady, Miss Robinson, arrived?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur. She is in the little _salon___.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"Poirot,\" I cried, keeping pace with him as he walked along the\ncorridor, \"who on earth is Miss Robinson?\"\n\nPoirot beamed kindly on me.\n\n\"It is that I have arranged you a marriage, Hastings.\"\n\n\"But, I say--\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said Poirot, giving me a friendly push over the threshold of the\ndoor. \"Do you think I wish to trumpet aloud in Merlinville the name of\nDuveen?\"\n\nIt was indeed Cinderella who rose to greet us. I took her hands in both\nof mine. My eyes said the rest.\n\nPoirot cleared his throat.\n\n\"_Mes enfants___,\" he said, \"for the moment we have no time for\nsentiment. There is work ahead of us. Mademoiselle, were you able to do\nwhat I asked you?\"\n\nIn response, Cinderella took from her bag an object wrapped up in\npaper, and handed it silently to Poirot. The latter unwrapped it. I\ngave a start--for it was the aeroplane dagger which I understood she had\ncast into the sea. Strange, how reluctant women always are to destroy\nthe most compromising of objects and documents!\n\n\"_Tres bien, mon enfant___,\" said Poirot. \"I am pleased with you. Go\nnow and rest yourself. Hastings here and I have work to do. You shall\nsee him tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Where are you going?\" asked the girl, her eyes widening.\n\n\"You shall hear all about it tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Because wherever you're going, I'm coming too.\"\n\n\"But mademoiselle--\"\n\n\"I'm coming too, I tell you.\"\n\nPoirot realized that it was futile to argue further.", "He gave in.\n\n\"Come then, mademoiselle. But it will not be amusing. In all\nprobability nothing will happen.\"\n\nThe girl made no reply.\n\nTwenty minutes later we set forth. It was quite dark now, a close,\noppressive evening. Poirot led the way out of the town in the direction\nof the Villa Genevieve. But when he reached the Villa Marguerite he\npaused.\n\n\"I should like to assure myself that all goes well with Jack Renauld.\nCome with me, Hastings. Mademoiselle will perhaps remain outside.\nMadame Daubreuil might say something which would wound her.\"\n\nWe unlatched the gate, and walked up the path. As we went round to the\nside of the house, I drew Poirot's attention to a window on the first\nfloor. Thrown sharply on the blind was the profile of Marthe Daubreuil.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Poirot. \"I figure to myself that that is the room where we\nshall find Jack Renauld.\"\n\nMadame Daubreuil opened the door to us. She explained that Jack was\nmuch the same, but perhaps we would like to see for ourselves. She led\nus upstairs and into the bedroom. Marthe Daubreuil was embroidering by\na table with a lamp on it. She put her finger to her lips as we\nentered.\n\nJack Renauld was sleeping an uneasy fitful sleep, his head turning from\nside to side, and his face still unduly flushed.\n\n\"Is the doctor coming again?\" asked Poirot in a whisper.\n\n\"Not unless we send. He is sleeping--that is the great thing. _Maman___\nmade him a tisane.\"\n\nShe sat down again with her embroidery as we left the room. Madame\nDaubreuil accompanied us down the stairs. Since I had learned of her\npast history, I viewed this woman with increased interest. She stood\nthere with her eyes cast down, the same very faint enigmatical smile\nthat I remembered on her lips. And suddenly I felt afraid of her, as\none might feel afraid of a beautiful poisonous snake.\n\n\"I hope we have not deranged you, madame,\" said Poirot politely as she\nopened the door for us to pass out.\n\n\"Not at all, monsieur.\"", "\"By the way,\" said Poirot, as though struck by an afterthought, \"M.\nStonor has not been in Merlinville today, has he?\"\n\nI could not at all fathom the point of this question which I well knew\nto be meaningless as far as Poirot was concerned.\n\nMadame Daubreuil replied quite composedly:\n\n\"Not that I know of.\"\n\n\"He has not had an interview with Mrs. Renauld?\"\n\n\"How should I know that, monsieur?\"\n\n\"True,\" said Poirot. \"I thought you might have seen him coming or\ngoing, that is all. Good night, madame.\"\n\n\"Why--\" I began.\n\n\"No '_whys___,' Hastings. There will be time for that later.\"\n\nWe rejoined Cinderella and made our way rapidly in the direction of the\nVilla Genevieve. Poirot looked over his shoulder once at the lighted\nwindow and the profile of Marthe as she bent over her work.\n\n\"He is being guarded at all events,\" he muttered.\n\nArrived at the Villa Genevieve, Poirot took up his stand behind some\nbushes to the left of the drive, where, whilst enjoying a good view\nourselves, we were completely hidden from sight. The Villa itself was\nin total darkness, everybody was without doubt in bed and asleep. We\nwere almost immediately under the window of Mrs. Renauld's bedroom,\nwhich window, I noticed, was open. It seemed to me that it was upon\nthis spot that Poirot's eyes were fixed.\n\n\"What are we going to do?\" I whispered.\n\n\"Watch.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"I do not expect anything to happen for at least an hour, probably two\nhours, but the--\"\n\nBut his words were interrupted by a long thin drawn cry:\n\n\"Help!\"\n\nA light flashed up in the second floor room on the right hand side of\nthe house. The cry came from there. And even as we watched there came a\nshadow on the blind as of two people struggling.\n\n\"_Mille tonnerres!___\" cried Poirot. \"She must have changed her room!\"\n\nDashing forward, he battered wildly on the front door. Then rushing to\nthe tree in the flower-bed, he swarmed up it with the agility of a cat.\nI followed him, as with a bound he sprang in through the open window.", "Looking over my shoulder, I saw Dulcie reaching the branch behind me.\n\n\"Take care,\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Take care of your grandmother!\" retorted the girl. \"This is child's\nplay to me.\"\n\nPoirot had rushed through the empty room and was pounding on the door\nleading into the corridor.\n\n\"Locked and bolted on the outside,\" he growled. \"And it will take time\nto burst it open.\"\n\nThe cries for help were getting noticeably fainter. I saw despair in\nPoirot's eyes. He and I together put our shoulders to the door.\n\nCinderella's voice, calm and dispassionate, came from the window:\n\n\"You'll be too late, I guess I'm the only one who can do anything.\"\n\nBefore I could move a hand to stop her, she appeared to leap upward\ninto space. I rushed and looked out. To my horror, I saw her hanging by\nher hands from the roof, propelling herself along by jerks in the\ndirection of the lighted window.\n\n\"Good heavens! She'll be killed,\" I cried.\n\n\"You forget. She's a professional acrobat, Hastings. It was the\nprovidence of the good God that made her insist on coming with us\ntonight. I only pray that she may be in time. Ah!\"\n\nA cry of absolute terror floated out on to the night as the girl\ndisappeared through the right-hand window; then in Cinderella's clear\ntones came the words:\n\n\"No, you don't! I've got you--and my wrists are just like steel.\"\n\nAt the same moment the door of our prison was opened cautiously by\nFrancoise. Poirot brushed her aside unceremoniously and rushed down the\npassage to where the other maids were grouped round the further door.\n\n\"It's locked on the inside, monsieur.\"\n\nThere was the sound of a heavy fall within. After a moment or two the\nkey turned and the door swung slowly open. Cinderella, very pale,\nbeckoned us in.\n\n\"She is safe?\" demanded Poirot.\n\n\"Yes, I was just in time. She was exhausted.\"\n\nMrs. Renauld was half sitting, half lying on the bed. She was gasping\nfor breath.\n\n\"Nearly strangled me,\" she murmured painfully. The girl picked up\nsomething from the floor and handed it to Poirot.", "It was a rolled up\nladder of silk rope, very fine but quite strong.\n\n\"A getaway,\" said Poirot. \"By the window, whilst we were battering at\nthe door. Where is--the other?\"\n\nThe girl stood aside a little and pointed. On the ground lay a figure\nwrapped in some dark material a fold of which hid the face.\n\n\"Dead?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"Head must have struck the marble fender.\"\n\n\"But who is it?\" I cried.\n\n\"The murderer of M. Renauld, Hastings. And the would-be murderer of\nMadame Renauld.\"\n\nPuzzled and uncomprehending, I knelt down, and lifting the fold of\ncloth, looked into the dead beautiful face of Marthe Daubreuil!\n\nI have confused memories of the further events of that night. Poirot\nseemed deaf to my repeated questions. He was engaged in overwhelming\nFrancoise with reproaches for not having told him of Mrs. Renauld's\nchange of sleeping quarters.\n\nI caught him by the shoulder, determined to attract his attention, and\nmake myself heard.\n\n\"But you _must___ have known,\" I expostulated. \"You were taken up to\nsee her this afternoon.\"\n\nPoirot deigned to attend to me for a brief moment.\n\n\"She had been wheeled on a sofa into the middle room--her boudoir,\" he\nexplained.\n\n\"But, monsieur,\" cried Francoise, \"Madame changed her room almost\nimmediately after the crime! The associations--they were too\ndistressing!\"\n\n\"Then why was I not told,\" vociferated Poirot, striking the table, and\nworking himself into a first-class passion. \"I demand\nyou--why--was--I--not--told? You are an old woman completely imbecile! And\nLeonie and Denise are no better. All of you are triple idiots! Your\nstupidity has nearly caused the death of your mistress. But for this\ncourageous child--\"\n\nHe broke off, and, darting across the room to where the girl was\nbending over ministering to Mrs. Renauld, he embraced her with Gallic\nfervour--slightly to my annoyance.\n\nI was aroused from my condition of mental fog by a sharp command from\nPoirot to fetch the doctor immediately on Mrs. Renauld's behalf. After\nthat, I might summon the police. And he added, to complete my dudgeon:\n\n\"It will hardly be worth your while to return here.", "I shall be too busy\nto attend to you, and of Mademoiselle here I make a _garde-malad___.\"\n\nI retired with what dignity I could command. Having done my errands, I\nreturned to the hotel. I understood next to nothing of what had\noccurred. The events of the night seemed fantastic and impossible.\nNobody would answer my questions. Nobody had seemed to hear them.\nAngrily, I flung myself into bed, and slept the sleep of the bewildered\nand utterly exhausted.\n\nI awoke to find the sun pouring in through the open windows and Poirot,\nneat and smiling, sitting beside the bed.\n\n\"_Enfin___ you wake! But it is that you are a famous sleeper, Hastings!\nDo you know that it is nearly eleven o'clock?\"\n\nI groaned and put a hand to my head.\n\n\"I must have been dreaming,\" I said. \"Do you know, I actually dreamt\nthat we found Marthe Daubreuil's body in Mrs. Renauld's room, and that\nyou declared her to have murdered Mr. Renauld?\"\n\n\"You were not dreaming. All that is quite true.\"\n\n\"But Bella Duveen killed Mr. Renauld?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Hastings, she did not! She said she did--yes--but that was to\nsave the man she loved from the guillotine.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Remember Jack Renauld's story. They both arrived on the scene at the\nsame instant, and each took the other to be the perpetrator of the\ncrime. The girl stares at him in horror, and then with a cry rushes\naway. But, when she hears that the crime has been brought home to him,\nshe cannot bear it, and comes forward to accuse herself and save him\nfrom certain death.\"\n\nPoirot leaned back in his chair, and brought the tips of his fingers\ntogether in familiar style.\n\n\"The case was not quite satisfactory to me,\" he observed judicially.\n\"All along I was strongly under the impression that we were dealing\nwith a cold-blooded and premeditated crime committed by some one who\nhad been contented (very cleverly) with using M. Renauld's own plans\nfor throwing the police off the track. The great criminal (as you may\nremember my remarking to you once) is always supremely simple.\"", "I nodded.\n\n\"Now, to support this theory, the criminal must have been fully\ncognizant of Mr. Renauld's plans. That leads us to Madame Renauld. But\nfacts fail to support any theory of her guilt. Is there any one else\nwho might have known of them? Yes. From Marthe Daubreuil's own lips we\nhave the admission that she overheard M. Renauld's quarrel with the\ntramp. If she could overhear that, there is no reason why she should\nnot have heard everything else, especially if M. and Madame Renauld\nwere imprudent enough to discuss their plans sitting on the bench.\nRemember how easily you overheard Marthe's conversation with Jack\nRenauld from that spot.\"\n\n\"But what possible motive could Marthe have for murdering Mr. Renauld?\"\nI argued.\n\n\"What motive? Money! M. Renauld was a millionaire several times over,\nand at his death (or so she and Jack believed) half that vast fortune\nwould pass to his son. Let us reconstruct the scene from the standpoint\nof Marthe Daubreuil.\n\n\"Marthe Daubreuil overhears what passes between Renauld and his wife.\nSo far he has been a nice little source of income to the Daubreuil\nmother and daughter, but now he proposes to escape from their toils. At\nfirst, possibly, her idea is to prevent that escape. But a bolder idea\ntakes its place, and one that fails to horrify the daughter of Jeanne\nBeroldy! At present M. Renauld stands inexorably in the way of her\nmarriage with Jack. If the latter defies his father, he will be a\npauper--which is not at all to the mind of Mademoiselle Marthe. In fact,\nI doubt if she has ever cared a straw for Jack Renauld. She can\nsimulate emotion, but in reality she is of the same cold, calculating\ntype as her mother. I doubt, too, whether she was really very sure of\nher hold over the boy's affections. She had dazzled and captivated him,\nbut separated from her, as his father could so easily manage to\nseparate him, she might lose him. But with M. Renauld dead, and Jack\nthe heir to half his millions, the marriage can take place at once, and\nat a stroke she will attain wealth--not the beggarly thousands that have\nbeen extracted from him so far.", "And her clever brain takes in the\nsimplicity of the thing. It is all so easy. M. Renauld is planning all\nthe circumstances of his death--she has only to step in at the right\nmoment and turn the farce into a grim reality. And here comes in the\nsecond point which led me infallibly to Marthe Daubreuil--the dagger!\nJack Renauld had _three___ souvenirs made. One he gave to his mother,\none to Bella Duveen; was it not highly probable that he had given the\nthird one to Marthe Daubreuil?\n\n\"So then, to sum up, there were four points of note against Marthe\nDaubreuil:\n\n\"(1) Marthe Daubreuil could have overheard M. Renauld's plans.\n\n\"(2) Marthe Daubreuil had a direct interest in causing M. Renauld's\ndeath.\n\n\"(3) Marthe Daubreuil was the daughter of the notorious Madame Beroldy\nwho in my opinion was morally and virtually the murderess of her\nhusband, although it may have been Georges Conneau's hand which struck\nthe actual blow.\n\n\"(4) Marthe Daubreuil was the only person, besides Jack Renauld, likely\nto have the third dagger in her possession.\"\n\nPoirot paused and cleared his throat.\n\n\"Of course, when I learned of the existence of the other girl, Bella\nDuveen, I realized that it was quite possible that _she___ might have\nkilled M. Renauld. The solution did not commend itself to me, because,\nas I pointed out to you, Hastings, an expert, such as I am, likes to\nmeet a foeman worthy of his steel. Still one must take crimes as one\nfinds them, not as one would like them to be. It did not seem very\nlikely that Bella Duveen would be wandering about carrying a souvenir\npaper-knife in her hand, but of course she might have had some idea all\nthe time of revenging herself on Jack Renauld. When she actually came\nforward and confessed to the murder, it seemed that all was over. And\nyet--I was not satisfied, _mon ami___. _I was not satisfied. ...___\n\n\"I went over the case again minutely, and I came to the same conclusion\nas before. If it was _not___ Bella Duveen, the only other person who\ncould have committed the crime was Marthe Daubreuil.", "But I had not one\nsingle proof against her!\n\n\"And then you showed me that letter from Mademoiselle Dulcie, and I saw\na chance of settling the matter once for all. The original dagger was\nstolen by Dulcie Duveen and thrown into the sea--since, as she thought,\nit belonged to her sister. But if, by any chance, it was _not___ her\nsister's, but the one given by Jack to Marthe Daubreuil--why then, Bella\nDuveen's dagger would be still intact! I said no word to you, Hastings\n(it was no time for romance) but I sought out Mademoiselle Dulcie, told\nher as much as I deemed needful, and set her to search amongst the\neffects of her sister. Imagine my elation, when she sought me out\n(according to my instructions) as Miss Robinson with the precious\nsouvenir in her possession!\n\n\"In the meantime I had taken steps to force Mademoiselle Marthe into\nthe open. By my orders, Mrs. Renauld repulsed her son, and declared her\nintention of making a will on the morrow which should cut him off from\never enjoying even a portion of his father's fortune. It was a\ndesperate step, but a necessary one, and Madame Renauld was fully\nprepared to take the risk--though unfortunately she also never thought\nof mentioning her change of room. I suppose she took it for granted\nthat I knew. All happened as I thought. Marthe Daubreuil made a last\nbold bid for the Renauld millions--and failed!\"\n\n\"What absolutely bewilders me,\" I said, \"is how she ever got into the\nhouse without our seeing her. It seems an absolute miracle. We left her\nbehind at the Villa Marguerite, we go straight to the Villa\nGenevieve--and yet she is there before us!\"\n\n\"Ah, but we did not leave her behind. She was out of the Villa\nMarguerite by the back way whilst we were talking to her mother in the\nhall. That is where, as the Americans say, she 'put it over' on Hercule\nPoirot!\"\n\n\"But the shadow on the blind? We saw it from the road.\"\n\n\"_Eh bien___, when we looked up, Madame Daubreuil had just had time to\nrun upstairs and take her place.\"", "\"Madame Daubreuil?\"\n\n\"Yes. One is old, and one is young, one dark, and one fair, but, for\nthe purpose of a silhouette on a blind, their profiles are singularly\nalike. Even I did not suspect--triple imbecile that I was! I thought I\nhad plenty of time before me--that she would not try to gain admission\nto the Villa until much later. She had brains, that beautiful\nMademoiselle Marthe.\"\n\n\"And her object was to murder Mrs. Renauld?\"\n\n\"Yes. The whole fortune would then pass to her son. But it would have\nbeen suicide, _mon ami!___ On the floor by Marthe Daubreuil's body, I\nfound a pad and a little bottle of chloroform and a hypodermic syringe\ncontaining a fatal dose of morphine. You understand? The chloroform\nfirst--then when the victim is unconscious the prick of the needle. By\nthe morning the smell of the chloroform has quite disappeared, and the\nsyringe lies where it has fallen from Madame Renauld's hand. What would\nhe say, the excellent M. Hautet? 'Poor woman! What did I tell you? The\nshock of joy, it was too much on top of the rest! Did I not say that I\nshould not be surprised if her brain became unhinged. Altogether a most\ntragic case, the Renauld Case!'\n\n\"However, Hastings, things did not go quite as Mademoiselle Marthe had\nplanned. To begin with, Madame Renauld was awake and waiting for her.\nThere is a struggle. But Madame Renauld is terribly weak still. There\nis a last chance for Marthe Daubreuil. The idea of suicide is at an\nend, but if she can silence Madame Renauld with her strong hands, make\na getaway with her little silk ladder whilst we are still battering on\nthe inside of the further door, and be back at the Villa Marguerite\nbefore we return there, it will be hard to prove anything against her.\nBut she was checkmated--not by Hercule Poirot--but by _la petite\nacrobate___ with her wrists of steel.\"\n\nI mused over the whole story.\n\n\"When did you first begin to suspect Marthe Daubreuil, Poirot? When she\ntold us she had overheard the quarrel in the garden?\"", "Poirot smiled.\n\n\"My friend, do you remember when we drove into Merlinville that first\nday? And the beautiful girl we saw standing at the gate? You asked me\nif I had not noticed a young goddess, and I replied to you that I had\nseen only a girl with anxious eyes. That is how I have thought of\nMarthe Daubreuil from the beginning. _The girl with the anxious\neyes!___ Why was she anxious? Not on Jack Renauld's behalf, for she did\nnot know then that he had been in Merlinville the previous evening.\"\n\n\"By the way,\" I exclaimed, \"how is Jack Renauld?\"\n\n\"Much better. He is still at the Villa Marguerite. But Madame Daubreuil\nhas disappeared. The police are looking for her.\"\n\n\"Was she in with her daughter, do you think?\"\n\n\"We shall never know. Madame is a lady who can keep her secrets. And I\ndoubt very much if the police will ever find her.\"\n\n\"Has Jack Renauld been--told?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"It will be a terrible shock to him.\"\n\n\"Naturally. And yet, do you know, Hastings, I doubt if his heart was\never seriously engaged. So far we have looked upon Bella Duveen as a\nsiren, and Marthe Daubreuil as the girl he really loved. But I think\nthat if we reversed the terms we should come nearer to the truth.\nMarthe Daubreuil was very beautiful. She set herself to fascinate Jack,\nand she succeeded, but remember his curious reluctance to break with\nthe other girl. And see how he was willing to go to the guillotine\nrather than implicate her. I have a little idea that when he learns the\ntruth he will be horrified--revolted, and his false love will wither\naway.\"\n\n\"What about Giraud?\"\n\n\"He has a _crise___ of the nerves, that one! He has been obliged to\nreturn to Paris.\"\n\nWe both smiled.\n\nPoirot proved a fairly true prophet. When at length the doctor\npronounced Jack Renauld strong enough to hear the truth, it was Poirot\nwho broke it to him. The shock was indeed terrific. Yet Jack rallied\nbetter than I could have supposed possible.", "His mother's devotion\nhelped him to live through those difficult days. The mother and son\nwere inseparable now.\n\nThere was a further revelation to come. Poirot had acquainted Mrs.\nRenauld with the fact that he knew her secret, and had represented to\nher that Jack should not be left in ignorance of his father's past.\n\n\"To hide the truth, never does it avail, madame! Be brave and tell him\neverything.\"\n\nWith a heavy heart Mrs. Renauld consented, and her son learned that the\nfather he had loved had been in actual fact a fugitive from justice. A\nhalting question was promptly answered by Poirot.\n\n\"Reassure yourself, M. Jack. The world knows nothing. As far as I can\nsee, there is no obligation for me to take the police into my\nconfidence. Throughout the case I have acted, not for them, but for\nyour father. Justice overtook him at last, but no one need ever know\nthat he and Georges Conneau were one and the same.\"\n\nThere were, of course, various points in the case that remained\npuzzling to the police, but Poirot explained things in so plausible a\nfashion that all query about them was gradually stilled.\n\nShortly after we got back to London, I noticed a magnificent model of a\nfoxhound adorning Poirot's mantelpiece. In answer to my inquiring\nglance, Poirot nodded.\n\n\"_Mais, oui!___ I got my 500 francs! Is he not a splendid fellow? I\ncall him Giraud!\"\n\nA few days later Jack Renauld came to see us with a resolute expression\non his face.\n\n\"M. Poirot, I've come to say good-bye. I'm sailing for South America\nalmost immediately. My father had large interests over the continent,\nand I mean to start a new life out there.\"\n\n\"You go alone, M. Jack?\"\n\n\"My mother comes with me--and I shall keep Stonor on as my secretary. He\nlikes out of-the-way parts of the world.\"\n\n\"No one else goes with you?\"\n\nJack flushed.\n\n\"You mean--?\"\n\n\"A girl who loves you very dearly--who has been willing to lay down her\nlife for you.\"\n\n\"How could I ask her?\"", "muttered the boy. \"After all that has happened,\ncould I go to her and--oh, what sort of a lame story could I tell?\"\n\n\"_Les femmes___--they have a wonderful genius for manufacturing crutches\nfor stories like that.\"\n\n\"Yes, but--I've been such a damned fool!\"\n\n\"So have all of us, at one time and another,\" observed Poirot\nphilosophically.\n\nBut Jack's face had hardened.\n\n\"There's something else. I'm my father's son. Would any one marry me,\nknowing that?\"\n\n\"You are your father's son, you say. Hastings here will tell you that I\nbelieve in heredity--\"\n\n\"Well, then--\"\n\n\"Wait. I know a woman, a woman of courage and endurance, capable of\ngreat love, of supreme self-sacrifice--\"\n\nThe boy looked up. His eyes softened.\n\n\"My mother!\"\n\n\"Yes. You are your mother's son as well as your father's. Go then to\nMademoiselle Bella. Tell her everything. Keep nothing back--and see what\nshe will say!\"\n\nJack looked irresolute.\n\n\"Go to her as a boy no longer, but a man--a man bowed by the fate of the\nPast, and the fate of Today, but looking forward to a new and wonderful\nlife. Ask her to share it with you. You may not realize it, but your\nlove for each other has been tested in the fire and not found wanting.\nYou have both been willing to lay down your lives for each other.\"\n\nAnd what of Captain Arthur Hastings, humble chronicler of these pages?\n\nThere is some talk of his joining the Renaulds on a ranch across the\nseas, but for the end of this story I prefer to go back to a morning in\nthe garden of the Villa Genevieve.\n\n\"I can't call you Bella,\" I said, \"since it isn't your name. And Dulcie\nseems so unfamiliar. So it's got to be Cinderella. Cinderella married\nthe Prince, you remember. I'm not a Prince, but--\"\n\nShe interrupted me.\n\n\"Cinderella warned him, I'm sure! You see, she couldn't promise to turn\ninto a princess. She was only a little scullion after all--\"\n\n\"It's the Prince's turn to interrupt,\" I interpolated. \"Do you know\nwhat he said?\"", "\"No?\"\n\n\" 'Hell!' said the Prince--and kissed her!\"\n\nAnd I suited the action to the word.\n\n\nIT was 2 p.m. on the afternoon of May 7, 1915. The _Lusitania_ had been\nstruck by two torpedoes in succession and was sinking rapidly, while\nthe boats were being launched with all possible speed. The women and\nchildren were being lined up awaiting their turn. Some still clung\ndesperately to husbands and fathers; others clutched their children\nclosely to their breasts. One girl stood alone, slightly apart from\nthe rest. She was quite young, not more than eighteen. She did not seem\nafraid, and her grave, steadfast eyes looked straight ahead.\n\n\"I beg your pardon.\"\n\nA man's voice beside her made her start and turn. She had noticed the\nspeaker more than once amongst the first-class passengers. There had\nbeen a hint of mystery about him which had appealed to her imagination.\nHe spoke to no one. If anyone spoke to him he was quick to rebuff the\noverture. Also he had a nervous way of looking over his shoulder with a\nswift, suspicious glance.\n\nShe noticed now that he was greatly agitated. There were beads of\nperspiration on his brow. He was evidently in a state of overmastering\nfear. And yet he did not strike her as the kind of man who would be\nafraid to meet death!\n\n\"Yes?\" Her grave eyes met his inquiringly.\n\nHe stood looking at her with a kind of desperate irresolution.\n\n\"It must be!\" he muttered to himself. \"Yes--it is the only way.\" Then\naloud he said abruptly: \"You are an American?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"A patriotic one?\"\n\nThe girl flushed.\n\n\"I guess you've no right to ask such a thing! Of course I am!\"\n\n\"Don't be offended. You wouldn't be if you knew how much there was at\nstake. But I've got to trust some one--and it must be a woman.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because of 'women and children first.'\" He looked round and lowered his\nvoice. \"I'm carrying papers--vitally important papers. They may make all\nthe difference to the Allies in the war. You understand? These papers\nhave _got_ to be saved!", "They've more chance with you than with me. Will\nyou take them?\"\n\nThe girl held out her hand.\n\n\"Wait--I must warn you. There may be a risk--if I've been followed. I\ndon't think I have, but one never knows. If so, there will be danger.\nHave you the nerve to go through with it?\"\n\nThe girl smiled.\n\n\"I'll go through with it all right. And I'm real proud to be chosen!\nWhat am I to do with them afterwards?\"\n\n\"Watch the newspapers! I'll advertise in the personal column of the\n_Times_, beginning 'Shipmate.' At the end of three days if there's\nnothing--well, you'll know I'm down and out. Then take the packet to\nthe American Embassy, and deliver it into the Ambassador's own hands. Is\nthat clear?\"\n\n\"Quite clear.\"\n\n\"Then be ready--I'm going to say good-bye.\" He took her hand in his.\n\"Good-bye. Good luck to you,\" he said in a louder tone.\n\nHer hand closed on the oilskin packet that had lain in his palm.\n\nThe _Lusitania_ settled with a more decided list to starboard. In answer\nto a quick command, the girl went forward to take her place in the boat.\n\n\"TOMMY, old thing!\"\n\n\"Tuppence, old bean!\"\n\nThe two young people greeted each other affectionately, and momentarily\nblocked the Dover Street Tube exit in doing so. The adjective \"old\"\n was misleading. Their united ages would certainly not have totalled\nforty-five.\n\n\"Not seen you for simply centuries,\" continued the young man. \"Where are\nyou off to? Come and chew a bun with me. We're getting a bit unpopular\nhere--blocking the gangway as it were. Let's get out of it.\"\n\nThe girl assenting, they started walking down Dover Street towards\nPiccadilly.\n\n\"Now then,\" said Tommy, \"where shall we go?\"\n\nThe very faint anxiety which underlay his tone did not escape the astute\nears of Miss Prudence Cowley, known to her intimate friends for some\nmysterious reason as \"Tuppence.\" She pounced at once.\n\n\"Tommy, you're stony!\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" declared Tommy unconvincingly. \"Rolling in cash.\"\n\n\"You always were a shocking liar,\" said Tuppence severely, \"though you\ndid once persuade Sister Greenbank that the doctor had ordered you beer\nas a tonic, but forgotten to write it on the chart.", "Do you remember?\"\n\nTommy chuckled.\n\n\"I should think I did! Wasn't the old cat in a rage when she found\nout? Not that she was a bad sort really, old Mother Greenbank! Good old\nhospital--demobbed like everything else, I suppose?\"\n\nTuppence sighed.\n\n\"Yes. You too?\"\n\nTommy nodded.\n\n\"Two months ago.\"\n\n\"Gratuity?\" hinted Tuppence.\n\n\"Spent.\"\n\n\"Oh, Tommy!\"\n\n\"No, old thing, not in riotous dissipation. No such luck! The cost of\nliving--ordinary plain, or garden living nowadays is, I assure you, if\nyou do not know----\"\n\n\"My dear child,\" interrupted Tuppence, \"there is nothing I do _not_ know\nabout the cost of living. Here we are at Lyons', and we will each of us\npay for our own. That's it!\" And Tuppence led the way upstairs.\n\nThe place was full, and they wandered about looking for a table,\ncatching odds and ends of conversation as they did so.\n\n\"And--do you know, she sat down and _cried_ when I told her she couldn't\nhave the flat after all.\" \"It was simply a _bargain_, my dear! Just like\nthe one Mabel Lewis brought from Paris----\"\n\n\"Funny scraps one does overhear,\" murmured Tommy. \"I passed two Johnnies\nin the street to-day talking about some one called Jane Finn. Did you\never hear such a name?\"\n\nBut at that moment two elderly ladies rose and collected parcels, and\nTuppence deftly ensconced herself in one of the vacant seats.\n\nTommy ordered tea and buns. Tuppence ordered tea and buttered toast.\n\n\"And mind the tea comes in separate teapots,\" she added severely.\n\nTommy sat down opposite her. His bared head revealed a shock\nof exquisitely slicked-back red hair. His face was pleasantly\nugly--nondescript, yet unmistakably the face of a gentleman and a\nsportsman. His brown suit was well cut, but perilously near the end of\nits tether.\n\nThey were an essentially modern-looking couple as they sat there.\nTuppence had no claim to beauty, but there was character and charm in\nthe elfin lines of her little face, with its determined chin and large,\nwide-apart grey eyes that looked mistily out from under straight, black\nbrows.", "She wore a small bright green toque over her black bobbed hair,\nand her extremely short and rather shabby skirt revealed a pair of\nuncommonly dainty ankles. Her appearance presented a valiant attempt at\nsmartness.\n\nThe tea came at last, and Tuppence, rousing herself from a fit of\nmeditation, poured it out.\n\n\"Now then,\" said Tommy, taking a large bite of bun, \"let's get\nup-to-date. Remember, I haven't seen you since that time in hospital in\n1916.\"\n\n\"Very well.\" Tuppence helped herself liberally to buttered toast.\n\"Abridged biography of Miss Prudence Cowley, fifth daughter of\nArchdeacon Cowley of Little Missendell, Suffolk. Miss Cowley left the\ndelights (and drudgeries) of her home life early in the war and came up\nto London, where she entered an officers' hospital. First month: Washed\nup six hundred and forty-eight plates every day. Second month: Promoted\nto drying aforesaid plates. Third month: Promoted to peeling potatoes.\nFourth month: Promoted to cutting bread and butter. Fifth month:\nPromoted one floor up to duties of wardmaid with mop and pail. Sixth\nmonth: Promoted to waiting at table. Seventh month: Pleasing appearance\nand nice manners so striking that am promoted to waiting on the Sisters!\nEighth month: Slight check in career. Sister Bond ate Sister Westhaven's\negg! Grand row! Wardmaid clearly to blame! Inattention in such important\nmatters cannot be too highly censured. Mop and pail again! How are the\nmighty fallen! Ninth month: Promoted to sweeping out wards, where I\nfound a friend of my childhood in Lieutenant Thomas Beresford (bow,\nTommy!), whom I had not seen for five long years. The meeting was\naffecting! Tenth month: Reproved by matron for visiting the pictures in\ncompany with one of the patients, namely: the aforementioned Lieutenant\nThomas Beresford. Eleventh and twelfth months: Parlourmaid duties\nresumed with entire success. At the end of the year left hospital in a\nblaze of glory. After that, the talented Miss Cowley drove successively\na trade delivery van, a motor-lorry and a general! The last was the\npleasantest. He was quite a young general!\"\n\n\"What blighter was that?\" inquired Tommy.", "\"Perfectly sickening the way\nthose brass hats drove from the War Office to the _Savoy_, and from the\n_Savoy_ to the War Office!\"\n\n\"I've forgotten his name now,\" confessed Tuppence. \"To resume, that was\nin a way the apex of my career. I next entered a Government office. We\nhad several very enjoyable tea parties. I had intended to become a\nland girl, a postwoman, and a bus conductress by way of rounding off\nmy career--but the Armistice intervened! I clung to the office with the\ntrue limpet touch for many long months, but, alas, I was combed out at\nlast. Since then I've been looking for a job. Now then--your turn.\"\n\n\"There's not so much promotion in mine,\" said Tommy regretfully, \"and a\ngreat deal less variety. I went out to France again, as you know. Then\nthey sent me to Mesopotamia, and I got wounded for the second time,\nand went into hospital out there. Then I got stuck in Egypt till the\nArmistice happened, kicked my heels there some time longer, and, as I\ntold you, finally got demobbed. And, for ten long, weary months I've\nbeen job hunting! There aren't any jobs! And, if there were, they\nwouldn't give 'em to me. What good am I? What do I know about business?\nNothing.\"\n\nTuppence nodded gloomily.\n\n\"What about the colonies?\" she suggested.\n\nTommy shook his head.\n\n\"I shouldn't like the colonies--and I'm perfectly certain they wouldn't\nlike me!\"\n\n\"Rich relations?\"\n\nAgain Tommy shook his head.\n\n\"Oh, Tommy, not even a great-aunt?\"\n\n\"I've got an old uncle who's more or less rolling, but he's no good.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Wanted to adopt me once. I refused.\"\n\n\"I think I remember hearing about it,\" said Tuppence slowly. \"You\nrefused because of your mother----\"\n\nTommy flushed.\n\n\"Yes, it would have been a bit rough on the mater. As you know, I was\nall she had. Old boy hated her--wanted to get me away from her. Just a\nbit of spite.\"\n\n\"Your mother's dead, isn't she?\" said Tuppence gently.\n\nTommy nodded.\n\nTuppence's large grey eyes looked misty.", "\"You're a good sort, Tommy. I always knew it.\"\n\n\"Rot!\" said Tommy hastily. \"Well, that's my position. I'm just about\ndesperate.\"\n\n\"So am I! I've hung out as long as I could. I've touted round. I've\nanswered advertisements. I've tried every mortal blessed thing. I've\nscrewed and saved and pinched! But it's no good. I shall have to go\nhome!\"\n\n\"Don't you want to?\"\n\n\"Of course I don't want to! What's the good of being sentimental?\nFather's a dear--I'm awfully fond of him--but you've no idea how I worry\nhim! He has that delightful early Victorian view that short skirts and\nsmoking are immoral. You can imagine what a thorn in the flesh I am to\nhim! He just heaved a sigh of relief when the war took me off. You see,\nthere are seven of us at home. It's awful! All housework and mothers'\nmeetings! I have always been the changeling. I don't want to go back,\nbut--oh, Tommy, what else is there to do?\"\n\nTommy shook his head sadly. There was a silence, and then Tuppence burst\nout:\n\n\"Money, money, money! I think about money morning, noon and night! I\ndare say it's mercenary of me, but there it is!\"\n\n\"Same here,\" agreed Tommy with feeling.\n\n\"I've thought over every imaginable way of getting it too,\" continued\nTuppence. \"There are only three! To be left it, to marry it, or to make\nit. First is ruled out. I haven't got any rich elderly relatives. Any\nrelatives I have are in homes for decayed gentlewomen! I always help old\nladies over crossings, and pick up parcels for old gentlemen, in case\nthey should turn out to be eccentric millionaires. But not one of them\nhas ever asked me my name--and quite a lot never said 'Thank you.'\"\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"Of course,\" resumed Tuppence, \"marriage is my best chance. I made up my\nmind to marry money when I was quite young. Any thinking girl would!\nI'm not sentimental, you know.\" She paused. \"Come now, you can't say I'm\nsentimental,\" she added sharply.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" agreed Tommy hastily.", "\"No one would ever think of\nsentiment in connection with you.\"\n\n\"That's not very polite,\" replied Tuppence. \"But I dare say you mean it\nall right. Well, there it is! I'm ready and willing--but I never meet\nany rich men! All the boys I know are about as hard up as I am.\"\n\n\"What about the general?\" inquired Tommy.\n\n\"I fancy he keeps a bicycle shop in time of peace,\" explained Tuppence.\n\"No, there it is! Now _you_ could marry a rich girl.\"\n\n\"I'm like you. I don't know any.\"\n\n\"That doesn't matter. You can always get to know one. Now, if I see a\nman in a fur coat come out of the _Ritz_ I can't rush up to him and say:\n'Look here, you're rich. I'd like to know you.'\"\n\n\"Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garbed female?\"\n\n\"Don't be silly. You tread on her foot, or pick up her handkerchief, or\nsomething like that. If she thinks you want to know her she's flattered,\nand will manage it for you somehow.\"\n\n\"You overrate my manly charms,\" murmured Tommy.\n\n\"On the other hand,\" proceeded Tuppence, \"my millionaire would probably\nrun for his life! No--marriage is fraught with difficulties. Remains--to\n_make_ money!\"\n\n\"We've tried that, and failed,\" Tommy reminded her.\n\n\"We've tried all the orthodox ways, yes. But suppose we try the\nunorthodox. Tommy, let's be adventurers!\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Tommy cheerfully. \"How do we begin?\"\n\n\"That's the difficulty. If we could make ourselves known, people might\nhire us to commit crimes for them.\"\n\n\"Delightful,\" commented Tommy. \"Especially coming from a clergyman's\ndaughter!\"\n\n\"The moral guilt,\" Tuppence pointed out, \"would be theirs--not mine. You\nmust admit that there's a difference between stealing a diamond necklace\nfor yourself and being hired to steal it.\"\n\n\"There wouldn't be the least difference if you were caught!\"\n\n\"Perhaps not. But I shouldn't be caught. I'm so clever.\"\n\n\"Modesty always was your besetting sin,\" remarked Tommy.\n\n\"Don't rag. Look here, Tommy, shall we really? Shall we form a business\npartnership?\"\n\n\"Form a company for the stealing of diamond necklaces?\"", "\"That was only an illustration. Let's have a--what do you call it in\nbook-keeping?\"\n\n\"Don't know. Never did any.\"\n\n\"I have--but I always got mixed up, and used to put credit entries on\nthe debit side, and vice versa--so they fired me out. Oh, I know--a\njoint venture! It struck me as such a romantic phrase to come across in\nthe middle of musty old figures. It's got an Elizabethan flavour about\nit--makes one think of galleons and doubloons. A joint venture!\"\n\n\"Trading under the name of the Young Adventurers, Ltd.? Is that your\nidea, Tuppence?\"\n\n\"It's all very well to laugh, but I feel there might be something in\nit.\"\n\n\"How do you propose to get in touch with your would-be employers?\"\n\n\"Advertisement,\" replied Tuppence promptly. \"Have you got a bit of paper\nand a pencil? Men usually seem to have. Just like we have hairpins and\npowder-puffs.\"\n\nTommy handed over a rather shabby green notebook, and Tuppence began\nwriting busily.\n\n\"Shall we begin: 'Young officer, twice wounded in the war----'\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well, my dear boy. But I can assure you that that sort of\nthing might touch the heart of an elderly spinster, and she might adopt\nyou, and then there would be no need for you to be a young adventurer at\nall.\"\n\n\"I don't want to be adopted.\"\n\n\"I forgot you had a prejudice against it. I was only ragging you!\nThe papers are full up to the brim with that type of thing. Now\nlisten--how's this? 'Two young adventurers for hire. Willing to do\nanything, go anywhere. Pay must be good.' (We might as well make\nthat clear from the start.) Then we might add: 'No reasonable offer\nrefused'--like flats and furniture.\"\n\n\"I should think any offer we get in answer to that would be a pretty\n_un_reasonable one!\"\n\n\"Tommy! You're a genius! That's ever so much more chic. 'No unreasonable\noffer refused--if pay is good.' How's that?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't mention pay again. It looks rather eager.\"\n\n\"It couldn't look as eager as I feel!", "But perhaps you are right. Now\nI'll read it straight through. 'Two young adventurers for hire. Willing\nto do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good. No unreasonable offer\nrefused.' How would that strike you if you read it?\"\n\n\"It would strike me as either being a hoax, or else written by a\nlunatic.\"\n\n\"It's not half so insane as a thing I read this morning beginning\n'Petunia' and signed 'Best Boy.'\" She tore out the leaf and handed it\nto Tommy. \"There you are. _Times_, I think. Reply to Box so-and-so.\nI expect it will be about five shillings. Here's half a crown for my\nshare.\"\n\nTommy was holding the paper thoughtfully. His faced burned a deeper red.\n\n\"Shall we really try it?\" he said at last. \"Shall we, Tuppence? Just for\nthe fun of the thing?\"\n\n\"Tommy, you're a sport! I knew you would be! Let's drink to success.\"\n She poured some cold dregs of tea into the two cups.\n\n\"Here's to our joint venture, and may it prosper!\"\n\n\"The Young Adventurers, Ltd.!\" responded Tommy.\n\nThey put down the cups and laughed rather uncertainly. Tuppence rose.\n\n\"I must return to my palatial suite at the hostel.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is time I strolled round to the _Ritz_,\" agreed Tommy with a\ngrin. \"Where shall we meet? And when?\"\n\n\"Twelve o'clock to-morrow. Piccadilly Tube station. Will that suit you?\"\n\n\"My time is my own,\" replied Mr. Beresford magnificently.\n\n\"So long, then.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, old thing.\"\n\nThe two young people went off in opposite directions. Tuppence's hostel\nwas situated in what was charitably called Southern Belgravia. For\nreasons of economy she did not take a bus.\n\nShe was half-way across St. James's Park, when a man's voice behind her\nmade her start.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" it said. \"But may I speak to you for a moment?\"\n\nTUPPENCE turned sharply, but the words hovering on the tip of her tongue\nremained unspoken, for the man's appearance and manner did not bear out\nher first and most natural assumption. She hesitated. As if he read her\nthoughts, the man said quickly:\n\n\"I can assure you I mean no disrespect.\"", "Tuppence believed him. Although she disliked and distrusted him\ninstinctively, she was inclined to acquit him of the particular motive\nwhich she had at first attributed to him. She looked him up and down. He\nwas a big man, clean shaven, with a heavy jowl. His eyes were small and\ncunning, and shifted their glance under her direct gaze.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" she asked.\n\nThe man smiled.\n\n\"I happened to overhear part of your conversation with the young\ngentleman in Lyons'.\"\n\n\"Well--what of it?\"\n\n\"Nothing--except that I think I may be of some use to you.\"\n\nAnother inference forced itself into Tuppence's mind:\n\n\"You followed me here?\"\n\n\"I took that liberty.\"\n\n\"And in what way do you think you could be of use to me?\"\n\nThe man took a card from his pocket and handed it to her with a bow.\n\nTuppence took it and scrutinized it carefully. It bore the inscription,\n\"Mr. Edward Whittington.\" Below the name were the words \"Esthonia\nGlassware Co.,\" and the address of a city office. Mr. Whittington spoke\nagain:\n\n\"If you will call upon me to-morrow morning at eleven o'clock, I will\nlay the details of my proposition before you.\"\n\n\"At eleven o'clock?\" said Tuppence doubtfully.\n\n\"At eleven o'clock.\"\n\nTuppence made up her mind.\n\n\"Very well. I'll be there.\"\n\n\"Thank you. Good evening.\"\n\nHe raised his hat with a flourish, and walked away. Tuppence remained\nfor some minutes gazing after him. Then she gave a curious movement of\nher shoulders, rather as a terrier shakes himself.\n\n\"The adventures have begun,\" she murmured to herself. \"What does he want\nme to do, I wonder? There's something about you, Mr. Whittington, that I\ndon't like at all. But, on the other hand, I'm not the least bit afraid\nof you. And as I've said before, and shall doubtless say again, little\nTuppence can look after herself, thank you!\"\n\nAnd with a short, sharp nod of her head she walked briskly onward. As a\nresult of further meditations, however, she turned aside from the direct\nroute and entered a post office. There she pondered for some moments,\na telegraph form in her hand.", "The thought of a possible five shillings\nspent unnecessarily spurred her to action, and she decided to risk the\nwaste of ninepence.\n\nDisdaining the spiky pen and thick, black treacle which a beneficent\nGovernment had provided, Tuppence drew out Tommy's pencil which she had\nretained and wrote rapidly: \"Don't put in advertisement. Will explain\nto-morrow.\" She addressed it to Tommy at his club, from which in one\nshort month he would have to resign, unless a kindly fortune permitted\nhim to renew his subscription.\n\n\"It may catch him,\" she murmured. \"Anyway, it's worth trying.\"\n\nAfter handing it over the counter she set out briskly for home, stopping\nat a baker's to buy three penny-worth of new buns.\n\nLater, in her tiny cubicle at the top of the house she munched buns and\nreflected on the future. What was the Esthonia Glassware Co., and what\nearthly need could it have for her services? A pleasurable thrill of\nexcitement made Tuppence tingle. At any rate, the country vicarage had\nretreated into the background again. The morrow held possibilities.\n\nIt was a long time before Tuppence went to sleep that night, and, when\nat length she did, she dreamed that Mr. Whittington had set her to\nwashing up a pile of Esthonia Glassware, which bore an unaccountable\nresemblance to hospital plates!\n\nIt wanted some five minutes to eleven when Tuppence reached the block\nof buildings in which the offices of the Esthonia Glassware Co. were\nsituated. To arrive before the time would look over-eager. So Tuppence\ndecided to walk to the end of the street and back again. She did so. On\nthe stroke of eleven she plunged into the recesses of the building.\nThe Esthonia Glassware Co. was on the top floor. There was a lift, but\nTuppence chose to walk up.\n\nSlightly out of breath, she came to a halt outside the ground glass door\nwith the legend painted across it \"Esthonia Glassware Co.\"\n\nTuppence knocked. In response to a voice from within, she turned the\nhandle and walked into a small rather dirty outer office.\n\nA middle-aged clerk got down from a high stool at a desk near the window\nand came towards her inquiringly.", "\"I have an appointment with Mr. Whittington,\" said Tuppence.\n\n\"Will you come this way, please.\" He crossed to a partition door with\n\"Private\" on it, knocked, then opened the door and stood aside to let\nher pass in.\n\nMr. Whittington was seated behind a large desk covered with papers.\nTuppence felt her previous judgment confirmed. There was something wrong\nabout Mr. Whittington. The combination of his sleek prosperity and his\nshifty eye was not attractive.\n\nHe looked up and nodded.\n\n\"So you've turned up all right? That's good. Sit down, will you?\"\n\nTuppence sat down on the chair facing him. She looked particularly small\nand demure this morning. She sat there meekly with downcast eyes whilst\nMr. Whittington sorted and rustled amongst his papers. Finally he pushed\nthem away, and leaned over the desk.\n\n\"Now, my dear young lady, let us come to business.\" His large face\nbroadened into a smile. \"You want work? Well, I have work to offer\nyou. What should you say now to PS100 down, and all expenses paid?\" Mr.\nWhittington leaned back in his chair, and thrust his thumbs into the\narm-holes of his waistcoat.\n\nTuppence eyed him warily.\n\n\"And the nature of the work?\" she demanded.\n\n\"Nominal--purely nominal. A pleasant trip, that is all.\"\n\n\"Where to?\"\n\nMr. Whittington smiled again.\n\n\"Paris.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence thoughtfully. To herself she said: \"Of course,\nif father heard that he would have a fit! But somehow I don't see Mr.\nWhittington in the role of the gay deceiver.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" continued Whittington. \"What could be more delightful? To put the\nclock back a few years--a very few, I am sure--and re-enter one of those\ncharming _pensionnats de jeunes filles_ with which Paris abounds----\"\n\nTuppence interrupted him.\n\n\"A _pensionnat?_\"\n\n\"Exactly. Madame Colombier's in the Avenue de Neuilly.\"\n\nTuppence knew the name well. Nothing could have been more select. She\nhad had several American friends there. She was more than ever puzzled.\n\n\"You want me to go to Madame Colombier's? For how long?\"\n\n\"That depends. Possibly three months.\"\n\n\"And that is all? There are no other conditions?\"", "\"None whatever. You would, of course, go in the character of my ward,\nand you would hold no communication with your friends. I should have\nto request absolute secrecy for the time being. By the way, you are\nEnglish, are you not?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Yet you speak with a slight American accent?\"\n\n\"My great pal in hospital was a little American girl. I dare say I\npicked it up from her. I can soon get out of it again.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, it might be simpler for you to pass as an American.\nDetails about your past life in England might be more difficult to\nsustain. Yes, I think that would be decidedly better. Then----\"\n\n\"One moment, Mr. Whittington! You seem to be taking my consent for\ngranted.\"\n\nWhittington looked surprised.\n\n\"Surely you are not thinking of refusing? I can assure you that Madame\nColombier's is a most high-class and orthodox establishment. And the\nterms are most liberal.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Tuppence. \"That's just it. The terms are almost too\nliberal, Mr. Whittington. I cannot see any way in which I can be worth\nthat amount of money to you.\"\n\n\"No?\" said Whittington softly. \"Well, I will tell you. I could doubtless\nobtain some one else for very much less. What I am willing to pay for\nis a young lady with sufficient intelligence and presence of mind to\nsustain her part well, and also one who will have sufficient discretion\nnot to ask too many questions.\"\n\nTuppence smiled a little. She felt that Whittington had scored.\n\n\"There's another thing. So far there has been no mention of Mr.\nBeresford. Where does he come in?\"\n\n\"Mr. Beresford?\"\n\n\"My partner,\" said Tuppence with dignity. \"You saw us together\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes. But I'm afraid we shan't require his services.\"\n\n\"Then it's off!\" Tuppence rose. \"It's both or neither. Sorry--but that's\nhow it is. Good morning, Mr. Whittington.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute. Let us see if something can't be managed. Sit down\nagain, Miss----\" He paused interrogatively.\n\nTuppence's conscience gave her a passing twinge as she remembered the\narchdeacon. She seized hurriedly on the first name that came into her\nhead.", "\"Jane Finn,\" she said hastily; and then paused open-mouthed at the\neffect of those two simple words.\n\nAll the geniality had faded out of Whittington's face. It was purple\nwith rage, and the veins stood out on the forehead. And behind it all\nthere lurked a sort of incredulous dismay. He leaned forward and hissed\nsavagely:\n\n\"So that's your little game, is it?\"\n\nTuppence, though utterly taken aback, nevertheless kept her head. She\nhad not the faintest comprehension of his meaning, but she was naturally\nquick-witted, and felt it imperative to \"keep her end up\" as she phrased\nit.\n\nWhittington went on:\n\n\"Been playing with me, have you, all the time, like a cat and mouse?\nKnew all the time what I wanted you for, but kept up the comedy. Is that\nit, eh?\" He was cooling down. The red colour was ebbing out of his face.\nHe eyed her keenly. \"Who's been blabbing? Rita?\"\n\nTuppence shook her head. She was doubtful as to how long she could\nsustain this illusion, but she realized the importance of not dragging\nan unknown Rita into it.\n\n\"No,\" she replied with perfect truth. \"Rita knows nothing about me.\"\n\nHis eyes still bored into her like gimlets.\n\n\"How much do you know?\" he shot out.\n\n\"Very little indeed,\" answered Tuppence, and was pleased to note that\nWhittington's uneasiness was augmented instead of allayed. To have\nboasted that she knew a lot might have raised doubts in his mind.\n\n\"Anyway,\" snarled Whittington, \"you knew enough to come in here and\nplump out that name.\"\n\n\"It might be my own name,\" Tuppence pointed out.\n\n\"It's likely, isn't it, then there would be two girls with a name like\nthat?\"\n\n\"Or I might just have hit upon it by chance,\" continued Tuppence,\nintoxicated with the success of truthfulness.\n\nMr. Whittington brought his fist down upon the desk with a bang.\n\n\"Quit fooling! How much do you know? And how much do you want?\"\n\nThe last five words took Tuppence's fancy mightily, especially after a\nmeagre breakfast and a supper of buns the night before. Her present part\nwas of the adventuress rather than the adventurous order, but she did\nnot deny its possibilities.", "She sat up and smiled with the air of one\nwho has the situation thoroughly well in hand.\n\n\"My dear Mr. Whittington,\" she said, \"let us by all means lay our cards\nupon the table. And pray do not be so angry. You heard me say yesterday\nthat I proposed to live by my wits. It seems to me that I have now\nproved I have some wits to live by! I admit I have knowledge of a\ncertain name, but perhaps my knowledge ends there.\"\n\n\"Yes--and perhaps it doesn't,\" snarled Whittington.\n\n\"You insist on misjudging me,\" said Tuppence, and sighed gently.\n\n\"As I said once before,\" said Whittington angrily, \"quit fooling, and\ncome to the point. You can't play the innocent with me. You know a great\ndeal more than you're willing to admit.\"\n\nTuppence paused a moment to admire her own ingenuity, and then said\nsoftly:\n\n\"I shouldn't like to contradict you, Mr. Whittington.\"\n\n\"So we come to the usual question--how much?\"\n\nTuppence was in a dilemma. So far she had fooled Whittington with\ncomplete success, but to mention a palpably impossible sum might awaken\nhis suspicions. An idea flashed across her brain.\n\n\"Suppose we say a little something down, and a fuller discussion of the\nmatter later?\"\n\nWhittington gave her an ugly glance.\n\n\"Blackmail, eh?\"\n\nTuppence smiled sweetly.\n\n\"Oh no! Shall we say payment of services in advance?\"\n\nWhittington grunted.\n\n\"You see,\" explained Tuppence still sweetly, \"I'm so very fond of\nmoney!\"\n\n\"You're about the limit, that's what you are,\" growled Whittington, with\na sort of unwilling admiration. \"You took me in all right. Thought you\nwere quite a meek little kid with just enough brains for my purpose.\"\n\n\"Life,\" moralized Tuppence, \"is full of surprises.\"\n\n\"All the same,\" continued Whittington, \"some one's been talking. You say\nit isn't Rita. Was it----? Oh, come in.\"\n\nThe clerk followed his discreet knock into the room, and laid a paper at\nhis master's elbow.\n\n\"Telephone message just come for you, sir.\"\n\nWhittington snatched it up and read it. A frown gathered on his brow.\n\n\"That'll do, Brown.", "You can go.\"\n\nThe clerk withdrew, closing the door behind him. Whittington turned to\nTuppence.\n\n\"Come to-morrow at the same time. I'm busy now. Here's fifty to go on\nwith.\"\n\nHe rapidly sorted out some notes, and pushed them across the table to\nTuppence, then stood up, obviously impatient for her to go.\n\nThe girl counted the notes in a businesslike manner, secured them in her\nhandbag, and rose.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Whittington,\" she said politely. \"At least, au\nrevoir, I should say.\"\n\n\"Exactly. Au revoir!\" Whittington looked almost genial again, a\nreversion that aroused in Tuppence a faint misgiving. \"Au revoir, my\nclever and charming young lady.\"\n\nTuppence sped lightly down the stairs. A wild elation possessed her. A\nneighbouring clock showed the time to be five minutes to twelve.\n\n\"Let's give Tommy a surprise!\" murmured Tuppence, and hailed a taxi.\n\nThe cab drew up outside the tube station. Tommy was just within the\nentrance. His eyes opened to their fullest extent as he hurried forward\nto assist Tuppence to alight. She smiled at him affectionately, and\nremarked in a slightly affected voice:\n\n\"Pay the thing, will you, old bean? I've got nothing smaller than a\nfive-pound note!\"\n\nTHE moment was not quite so triumphant as it ought to have been. To\nbegin with, the resources of Tommy's pockets were somewhat limited. In\nthe end the fare was managed, the lady recollecting a plebeian twopence,\nand the driver, still holding the varied assortment of coins in his\nhand, was prevailed upon to move on, which he did after one last hoarse\ndemand as to what the gentleman thought he was giving him?\n\n\"I think you've given him too much, Tommy,\" said Tuppence innocently. \"I\nfancy he wants to give some of it back.\"\n\nIt was possibly this remark which induced the driver to move away.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Beresford, at length able to relieve his feelings,\n\"what the--dickens, did you want to take a taxi for?\"\n\n\"I was afraid I might be late and keep you waiting,\" said Tuppence\ngently.\n\n\"Afraid--you--might--be--late! Oh, Lord, I give it up!\"", "said Mr.\nBeresford.\n\n\"And really and truly,\" continued Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide,\n\"I haven't got anything smaller than a five-pound note.\"\n\n\"You did that part of it very well, old bean, but all the same the\nfellow wasn't taken in--not for a moment!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Tuppence thoughtfully, \"he didn't believe it. That's the\ncurious part about speaking the truth. No one does believe it. I found\nthat out this morning. Now let's go to lunch. How about the _Savoy?_\"\n\nTommy grinned.\n\n\"How about the _Ritz?_\"\n\n\"On second thoughts, I prefer the _Piccadilly_. It's nearer. We shan't\nhave to take another taxi. Come along.\"\n\n\"Is this a new brand of humour? Or is your brain really unhinged?\"\n inquired Tommy.\n\n\"Your last supposition is the correct one. I have come into money, and\nthe shock has been too much for me! For that particular form of mental\ntrouble an eminent physician recommends unlimited _Hors d'oeuvre_,\nLobster _a l'americane_, Chicken Newberg, and Peche Melba! Let's go\nand get them!\"\n\n\"Tuppence, old girl, what has really come over you?\"\n\n\"Oh, unbelieving one!\" Tuppence wrenched open her bag. \"Look here, and\nhere, and here!\"\n\n\"Great Jehosaphat! My dear girl, don't wave Fishers aloft like that!\"\n\n\"They're not Fishers. They're five times better than Fishers, and this\none's ten times better!\"\n\nTommy groaned.\n\n\"I must have been drinking unawares! Am I dreaming, Tuppence, or do I\nreally behold a large quantity of five-pound notes being waved about in\na dangerous fashion?\"\n\n\"Even so, O King! _Now_, will you come and have lunch?\"\n\n\"I'll come anywhere. But what have you been doing? Holding up a bank?\"\n\n\"All in good time. What an awful place Piccadilly Circus is. There's a\nhuge bus bearing down on us. It would be too terrible if they killed the\nfive-pound notes!\"\n\n\"Grill room?\" inquired Tommy, as they reached the opposite pavement in\nsafety.\n\n\"The other's more expensive,\" demurred Tuppence.\n\n\"That's mere wicked wanton extravagance. Come on below.\"\n\n\"Are you sure I can get all the things I want there?\"\n\n\"That extremely unwholesome menu you were outlining just now?", "Of course\nyou can--or as much as is good for you, anyway.\"\n\n\"And now tell me,\" said Tommy, unable to restrain his pent-up curiosity\nany longer, as they sat in state surrounded by the many _hors d'oeuvre_\nof Tuppence's dreams.\n\nMiss Cowley told him.\n\n\"And the curious part of it is,\" she ended, \"that I really did invent\nthe name of Jane Finn! I didn't want to give my own because of poor\nfather--in case I should get mixed up in anything shady.\"\n\n\"Perhaps that's so,\" said Tommy slowly. \"But you didn't invent it.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"No. _I_ told it to you. Don't you remember, I said yesterday I'd\noverheard two people talking about a female called Jane Finn? That's\nwhat brought the name into your mind so pat.\"\n\n\"So you did. I remember now. How extraordinary----\" Tuppence tailed off\ninto silence. Suddenly she aroused herself. \"Tommy!\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"What were they like, the two men you passed?\"\n\nTommy frowned in an effort at remembrance.\n\n\"One was a big fat sort of chap. Clean shaven, I think--and dark.\"\n\n\"That's him,\" cried Tuppence, in an ungrammatical squeal. \"That's\nWhittington! What was the other man like?\"\n\n\"I can't remember. I didn't notice him particularly. It was really the\noutlandish name that caught my attention.\"\n\n\"And people say that coincidences don't happen!\" Tuppence tackled her\nPeche Melba happily.\n\nBut Tommy had become serious.\n\n\"Look here, Tuppence, old girl, what is this going to lead to?\"\n\n\"More money,\" replied his companion.\n\n\"I know that. You've only got one idea in your head. What I mean is,\nwhat about the next step? How are you going to keep the game up?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Tuppence laid down her spoon. \"You're right, Tommy, it is a bit of\na poser.\"\n\n\"After all, you know, you can't bluff him forever. You're sure to slip\nup sooner or later. And, anyway, I'm not at all sure that it isn't\nactionable--blackmail, you know.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. Blackmail is saying you'll tell unless you are given\nmoney. Now, there's nothing I could tell, because I don't really know\nanything.\"\n\n\"Hm,\" said Tommy doubtfully.", "\"Well, anyway, what _are_ we going to do?\nWhittington was in a hurry to get rid of you this morning, but next time\nhe'll want to know something more before he parts with his money. He'll\nwant to know how much _you_ know, and where you got your information\nfrom, and a lot of other things that you can't cope with. What are you\ngoing to do about it?\"\n\nTuppence frowned severely.\n\n\"We must think. Order some Turkish coffee, Tommy. Stimulating to the\nbrain. Oh, dear, what a lot I have eaten!\"\n\n\"You have made rather a hog of yourself! So have I for that matter, but\nI flatter myself that my choice of dishes was more judicious than yours.\nTwo coffees.\" (This was to the waiter.) \"One Turkish, one French.\"\n\nTuppence sipped her coffee with a deeply reflective air, and snubbed\nTommy when he spoke to her.\n\n\"Be quiet. I'm thinking.\"\n\n\"Shades of Pelmanism!\" said Tommy, and relapsed into silence.\n\n\"There!\" said Tuppence at last. \"I've got a plan. Obviously what we've\ngot to do is to find out more about it all.\"\n\nTommy applauded.\n\n\"Don't jeer. We can only find out through Whittington. We must discover\nwhere he lives, what he does--sleuth him, in fact! Now I can't do it,\nbecause he knows me, but he only saw you for a minute or two in Lyons'.\nHe's not likely to recognize you. After all, one young man is much like\nanother.\"\n\n\"I repudiate that remark utterly. I'm sure my pleasing features and\ndistinguished appearance would single me out from any crowd.\"\n\n\"My plan is this,\" Tuppence went on calmly, \"I'll go alone to-morrow.\nI'll put him off again like I did to-day. It doesn't matter if I don't\nget any more money at once. Fifty pounds ought to last us a few days.\"\n\n\"Or even longer!\"\n\n\"You'll hang about outside. When I come out I shan't speak to you in\ncase he's watching. But I'll take up my stand somewhere near, and when\nhe comes out of the building I'll drop a handkerchief or something, and\noff you go!\"", "\"Off I go where?\"\n\n\"Follow him, of course, silly! What do you think of the idea?\"\n\n\"Sort of thing one reads about in books. I somehow feel that in real\nlife one will feel a bit of an ass standing in the street for hours with\nnothing to do. People will wonder what I'm up to.\"\n\n\"Not in the city. Every one's in such a hurry. Probably no one will even\nnotice you at all.\"\n\n\"That's the second time you've made that sort of remark. Never mind, I\nforgive you. Anyway, it will be rather a lark. What are you doing this\nafternoon?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Tuppence meditatively. \"I _had_ thought of hats! Or perhaps\nsilk stockings! Or perhaps----\"\n\n\"Hold hard,\" admonished Tommy. \"There's a limit to fifty pounds! But\nlet's do dinner and a show to-night at all events.\"\n\n\"Rather.\"\n\nThe day passed pleasantly. The evening even more so. Two of the\nfive-pound notes were now irretrievably dead.\n\nThey met by arrangement the following morning and proceeded citywards.\nTommy remained on the opposite side of the road while Tuppence plunged\ninto the building.\n\nTommy strolled slowly down to the end of the street, then back again.\nJust as he came abreast of the building, Tuppence darted across the\nroad.\n\n\"Tommy!\"\n\n\"Yes. What's up?\"\n\n\"The place is shut. I can't make anyone hear.\"\n\n\"That's odd.\"\n\n\"Isn't it? Come up with me, and let's try again.\"\n\nTommy followed her. As they passed the third floor landing a young clerk\ncame out of an office. He hesitated a moment, then addressed himself to\nTuppence.\n\n\"Were you wanting the Esthonia Glassware?\"\n\n\"Yes, please.\"\n\n\"It's closed down. Since yesterday afternoon. Company being wound up,\nthey say. Not that I've ever heard of it myself. But anyway the office\nis to let.\"\n\n\"Th--thank you,\" faltered Tuppence. \"I suppose you don't know Mr.\nWhittington's address?\"\n\n\"Afraid I don't. They left rather suddenly.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" said Tommy. \"Come on, Tuppence.\"\n\nThey descended to the street again where they gazed at one another\nblankly.\n\n\"That's torn it,\" said Tommy at length.\n\n\"And I never suspected it,\" wailed Tuppence.", "\"Cheer up, old thing, it can't be helped.\"\n\n\"Can't it, though!\" Tuppence's little chin shot out defiantly. \"Do you\nthink this is the end? If so, you're wrong. It's just the beginning!\"\n\n\"The beginning of what?\"\n\n\"Of our adventure! Tommy, don't you see, if they are scared enough to\nrun away like this, it shows that there must be a lot in this Jane Finn\nbusiness! Well, we'll get to the bottom of it. We'll run them down!\nWe'll be sleuths in earnest!\"\n\n\"Yes, but there's no one left to sleuth.\"\n\n\"No, that's why we'll have to start all over again. Lend me that bit of\npencil. Thanks. Wait a minute--don't interrupt. There!\" Tuppence handed\nback the pencil, and surveyed the piece of paper on which she had\nwritten with a satisfied eye:\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Advertisement.\"\n\n\"You're not going to put that thing in after all?\"\n\n\"No, it's a different one.\" She handed him the slip of paper.\n\nTommy read the words on it aloud:\n\n\"WANTED, any information respecting Jane Finn. Apply Y. A.\"\n\nTHE next day passed slowly. It was necessary to curtail expenditure.\nCarefully husbanded, forty pounds will last a long time. Luckily the\nweather was fine, and \"walking is cheap,\" dictated Tuppence. An outlying\npicture house provided them with recreation for the evening.\n\nThe day of disillusionment had been a Wednesday. On Thursday the\nadvertisement had duly appeared. On Friday letters might be expected to\narrive at Tommy's rooms.\n\nHe had been bound by an honourable promise not to open any such letters\nif they did arrive, but to repair to the National Gallery, where his\ncolleague would meet him at ten o'clock.\n\nTuppence was first at the rendezvous. She ensconced herself on a red\nvelvet seat, and gazed at the Turners with unseeing eyes until she saw\nthe familiar figure enter the room.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well,\" returned Mr. Beresford provokingly. \"Which is your favourite\npicture?\"\n\n\"Don't be a wretch. Aren't there _any_ answers?\"\n\nTommy shook his head with a deep and somewhat overacted melancholy.\n\n\"I didn't want to disappoint you, old thing, by telling you right off.", "It's too bad. Good money wasted.\" He sighed. \"Still, there it is. The\nadvertisement has appeared, and--there are only two answers!\"\n\n\"Tommy, you devil!\" almost screamed Tuppence. \"Give them to me. How\ncould you be so mean!\"\n\n\"Your language, Tuppence, your language! They're very particular at the\nNational Gallery. Government show, you know. And do remember, as I have\npointed out to you before, that as a clergyman's daughter----\"\n\n\"I ought to be on the stage!\" finished Tuppence with a snap.\n\n\"That is not what I intended to say. But if you are sure that you have\nenjoyed to the full the reaction of joy after despair with which I have\nkindly provided you free of charge, let us get down to our mail, as the\nsaying goes.\"\n\nTuppence snatched the two precious envelopes from him unceremoniously,\nand scrutinized them carefully.\n\n\"Thick paper, this one. It looks rich. We'll keep it to the last and\nopen the other first.\"\n\n\"Right you are. One, two, three, go!\"\n\nTuppence's little thumb ripped open the envelope, and she extracted the\ncontents.\n\n\"DEAR SIR,\n\n\"Referring to your advertisement in this morning's paper, I may be able\nto be of some use to you. Perhaps you could call and see me at the above\naddress at eleven o'clock to-morrow morning.\n\n\"Yours truly,\n\n\"A. CARTER.\"\n\n\"27 Carshalton Gardens,\" said Tuppence, referring to the address.\n\"That's Gloucester Road way. Plenty of time to get there if we tube.\"\n\n\"The following,\" said Tommy, \"is the plan of campaign. It is my turn to\nassume the offensive. Ushered into the presence of Mr. Carter, he and I\nwish each other good morning as is customary. He then says: 'Please take\na seat, Mr.--er?' To which I reply promptly and significantly: 'Edward\nWhittington!' whereupon Mr. Carter turns purple in the face and gasps\nout: 'How much?' Pocketing the usual fee of fifty pounds, I rejoin you\nin the road outside, and we proceed to the next address and repeat the\nperformance.\"\n\n\"Don't be absurd, Tommy. Now for the other letter. Oh, this is from the\n_Ritz!_\"\n\n\"A hundred pounds instead of fifty!\"", "\"I'll read it:\n\n\"DEAR SIR,\n\n\"Re your advertisement, I should be glad if you would call round\nsomewhere about lunch-time.\n\n\"Yours truly,\n\n\"JULIUS P. HERSHEIMMER.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" said Tommy. \"Do I smell a Boche? Or only an American millionaire\nof unfortunate ancestry? At all events we'll call at lunch-time. It's a\ngood time--frequently leads to free food for two.\"\n\nTuppence nodded assent.\n\n\"Now for Carter. We'll have to hurry.\"\n\nCarshalton Terrace proved to be an unimpeachable row of what Tuppence\ncalled \"ladylike looking houses.\" They rang the bell at No. 27, and a\nneat maid answered the door. She looked so respectable that Tuppence's\nheart sank. Upon Tommy's request for Mr. Carter, she showed them into\na small study on the ground floor where she left them. Hardly a minute\nelapsed, however, before the door opened, and a tall man with a lean\nhawklike face and a tired manner entered the room.\n\n\"Mr. Y. A.?\" he said, and smiled. His smile was distinctly attractive.\n\"Do sit down, both of you.\"\n\nThey obeyed. He himself took a chair opposite to Tuppence and smiled at\nher encouragingly. There was something in the quality of his smile that\nmade the girl's usual readiness desert her.\n\nAs he did not seem inclined to open the conversation, Tuppence was\nforced to begin.\n\n\"We wanted to know--that is, would you be so kind as to tell us anything\nyou know about Jane Finn?\"\n\n\"Jane Finn? Ah!\" Mr. Carter appeared to reflect. \"Well, the question is,\nwhat do _you_ know about her?\"\n\nTuppence drew herself up.\n\n\"I don't see that that's got anything to do with it.\"\n\n\"No? But it has, you know, really it has.\" He smiled again in his tired\nway, and continued reflectively. \"So that brings us down to it again.\nWhat do _you_ know about Jane Finn?\n\n\"Come now,\" he continued, as Tuppence remained silent. \"You must know\n_something_ to have advertised as you did?\" He leaned forward a little,\nhis weary voice held a hint of persuasiveness. \"Suppose you tell me....\"\n\nThere was something very magnetic about Mr. Carter's personality.", "Tuppence seemed to shake herself free of it with an effort, as she said:\n\n\"We couldn't do that, could we, Tommy?\"\n\nBut to her surprise, her companion did not back her up. His eyes were\nfixed on Mr. Carter, and his tone when he spoke held an unusual note of\ndeference.\n\n\"I dare say the little we know won't be any good to you, sir. But such\nas it is, you're welcome to it.\"\n\n\"Tommy!\" cried out Tuppence in surprise.\n\nMr. Carter slewed round in his chair. His eyes asked a question.\n\nTommy nodded.\n\n\"Yes, sir, I recognized you at once. Saw you in France when I was with\nthe Intelligence. As soon as you came into the room, I knew----\"\n\nMr. Carter held up his hand.\n\n\"No names, please. I'm known as Mr. Carter here. It's my cousin's house,\nby the way. She's willing to lend it to me sometimes when it's a case of\nworking on strictly unofficial lines. Well, now\"--he looked from one to\nthe other--\"who's going to tell me the story?\"\n\n\"Fire ahead, Tuppence,\" directed Tommy. \"It's your yarn.\"\n\n\"Yes, little lady, out with it.\"\n\nAnd obediently Tuppence did out with it, telling the whole story from\nthe forming of the Young Adventurers, Ltd., downwards.\n\nMr. Carter listened in silence with a resumption of his tired manner.\nNow and then he passed his hand across his lips as though to hide a\nsmile. When she had finished he nodded gravely.\n\n\"Not much. But suggestive. Quite suggestive. If you'll excuse my saying\nso, you're a curious young couple. I don't know--you might succeed where\nothers have failed ... I believe in luck, you know--always have....\"\n\nHe paused a moment, and then went on.\n\n\"Well, how about it? You're out for adventure. How would you like\nto work for me? All quite unofficial, you know. Expenses paid, and a\nmoderate screw?\"\n\nTuppence gazed at him, her lips parted, her eyes growing wider and\nwider.\n\n\"What should we have to do?\" she breathed.\n\nMr. Carter smiled.\n\n\"Just go on with what you're doing now. _Find Jane Finn_.\"", "\"Yes, but--who _is_ Jane Finn?\"\n\nMr. Carter nodded gravely.\n\n\"Yes, you're entitled to know that, I think.\"\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, crossed his legs, brought the tips of his\nfingers together, and began in a low monotone:\n\n\"Secret diplomacy (which, by the way, is nearly always bad policy!) does\nnot concern you. It will be sufficient to say that in the early days of\n1915 a certain document came into being. It was the draft of a secret\nagreement--treaty--call it what you like. It was drawn up ready for\nsignature by the various representatives, and drawn up in America--at\nthat time a neutral country. It was dispatched to England by a special\nmessenger selected for that purpose, a young fellow called Danvers. It\nwas hoped that the whole affair had been kept so secret that nothing\nwould have leaked out. That kind of hope is usually disappointed.\nSomebody always talks!\n\n\"Danvers sailed for England on the _Lusitania_. He carried the precious\npapers in an oilskin packet which he wore next his skin. It was on that\nparticular voyage that the _Lusitania_ was torpedoed and sunk. Danvers\nwas among the list of those missing. Eventually his body was washed\nashore, and identified beyond any possible doubt. But the oilskin packet\nwas missing!\n\n\"The question was, had it been taken from him, or had he himself\npassed it on into another's keeping? There were a few incidents that\nstrengthened the possibility of the latter theory. After the torpedo\nstruck the ship, in the few moments during the launching of the boats,\nDanvers was seen speaking to a young American girl. No one actually\nsaw him pass anything to her, but he might have done so. It seems to me\nquite likely that he entrusted the papers to this girl, believing that\nshe, as a woman, had a greater chance of bringing them safely to shore.\n\n\"But if so, where was the girl, and what had she done with the papers?\nBy later advice from America it seemed likely that Danvers had been\nclosely shadowed on the way over.", "Was this girl in league with his\nenemies? Or had she, in her turn, been shadowed and either tricked or\nforced into handing over the precious packet?\n\n\"We set to work to trace her out. It proved unexpectedly difficult.\nHer name was Jane Finn, and it duly appeared among the list of the\nsurvivors, but the girl herself seemed to have vanished completely.\nInquiries into her antecedents did little to help us. She was an orphan,\nand had been what we should call over here a pupil teacher in a small\nschool out West. Her passport had been made out for Paris, where she\nwas going to join the staff of a hospital. She had offered her services\nvoluntarily, and after some correspondence they had been accepted.\nHaving seen her name in the list of the saved from the _Lusitania_, the\nstaff of the hospital were naturally very surprised at her not arriving\nto take up her billet, and at not hearing from her in any way.\n\n\"Well, every effort was made to trace the young lady--but all in vain.\nWe tracked her across Ireland, but nothing could be heard of her after\nshe set foot in England. No use was made of the draft treaty--as might\nvery easily have been done--and we therefore came to the conclusion that\nDanvers had, after all, destroyed it. The war entered on another phase,\nthe diplomatic aspect changed accordingly, and the treaty was never\nredrafted. Rumours as to its existence were emphatically denied. The\ndisappearance of Jane Finn was forgotten and the whole affair was lost\nin oblivion.\"\n\nMr. Carter paused, and Tuppence broke in impatiently:\n\n\"But why has it all cropped up again? The war's over.\"\n\nA hint of alertness came into Mr. Carter's manner.\n\n\"Because it seems that the papers were not destroyed after all, and that\nthey might be resurrected to-day with a new and deadly significance.\"\n\nTuppence stared. Mr. Carter nodded.\n\n\"Yes, five years ago, that draft treaty was a weapon in our hands;\nto-day it is a weapon against us. It was a gigantic blunder.", "If its\nterms were made public, it would mean disaster.... It might possibly\nbring about another war--not with Germany this time! That is an extreme\npossibility, and I do not believe in its likelihood myself, but that\ndocument undoubtedly implicates a number of our statesmen whom we cannot\nafford to have discredited in any way at the present moment. As a party\ncry for Labour it would be irresistible, and a Labour Government at this\njuncture would, in my opinion, be a grave disability for British trade,\nbut that is a mere nothing to the _real_ danger.\"\n\nHe paused, and then said quietly:\n\n\"You may perhaps have heard or read that there is Bolshevist influence\nat work behind the present Labour unrest?\"\n\nTuppence nodded.\n\n\"That is the truth. Bolshevist gold is pouring into this country for the\nspecific purpose of procuring a Revolution. And there is a certain man,\na man whose real name is unknown to us, who is working in the dark for\nhis own ends. The Bolshevists are behind the Labour unrest--but this\nman is _behind the Bolshevists_. Who is he? We do not know. He is always\nspoken of by the unassuming title of 'Mr. Brown.' But one thing is\ncertain, he is the master criminal of this age. He controls a marvellous\norganization. Most of the Peace propaganda during the war was originated\nand financed by him. His spies are everywhere.\"\n\n\"A naturalized German?\" asked Tommy.\n\n\"On the contrary, I have every reason to believe he is an Englishman. He\nwas pro-German, as he would have been pro-Boer. What he seeks to attain\nwe do not know--probably supreme power for himself, of a kind unique in\nhistory. We have no clue as to his real personality. It is reported that\neven his own followers are ignorant of it. Where we have come across his\ntracks, he has always played a secondary part. Somebody else assumes\nthe chief role. But afterwards we always find that there has been some\nnonentity, a servant or a clerk, who has remained in the background\nunnoticed, and that the elusive Mr.", "Brown has escaped us once more.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Tuppence jumped. \"I wonder----\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I remember in Mr. Whittington's office. The clerk--he called him Brown.\nYou don't think----\"\n\nCarter nodded thoughtfully.\n\n\"Very likely. A curious point is that the name is usually mentioned. An\nidiosyncrasy of genius. Can you describe him at all?\"\n\n\"I really didn't notice. He was quite ordinary--just like anyone else.\"\n\nMr. Carter sighed in his tired manner.\n\n\"That is the invariable description of Mr. Brown! Brought a telephone\nmessage to the man Whittington, did he? Notice a telephone in the outer\noffice?\"\n\nTuppence thought.\n\n\"No, I don't think I did.\"\n\n\"Exactly. That 'message' was Mr. Brown's way of giving an order to his\nsubordinate. He overheard the whole conversation of course. Was it after\nthat that Whittington handed you over the money, and told you to come\nthe following day?\"\n\nTuppence nodded.\n\n\"Yes, undoubtedly the hand of Mr. Brown!\" Mr. Carter paused. \"Well,\nthere it is, you see what you are pitting yourselves against? Possibly\nthe finest criminal brain of the age. I don't quite like it, you know.\nYou're such young things, both of you. I shouldn't like anything to\nhappen to you.\"\n\n\"It won't,\" Tuppence assured him positively.\n\n\"I'll look after her, sir,\" said Tommy.\n\n\"And _I_'ll look after _you_,\" retorted Tuppence, resenting the manly\nassertion.\n\n\"Well, then, look after each other,\" said Mr. Carter, smiling. \"Now\nlet's get back to business. There's something mysterious about this\ndraft treaty that we haven't fathomed yet. We've been threatened with\nit--in plain and unmistakable terms. The Revolutionary element as good\nas declare that it's in their hands, and that they intend to produce it\nat a given moment. On the other hand, they are clearly at fault about\nmany of its provisions. The Government consider it as mere bluff\non their part, and, rightly or wrongly, have stuck to the policy of\nabsolute denial. I'm not so sure. There have been hints, indiscreet\nallusions, that seem to indicate that the menace is a real one. The\nposition is much as though they had got hold of an incriminating\ndocument, but couldn't read it because it was in cipher--but we know\nthat the draft treaty wasn't in cipher--couldn't be in the nature of\nthings--so that won't wash.", "But there's _something_. Of course, Jane\nFinn may be dead for all we know--but I don't think so. The curious\nthing is that _they're trying to get information about the girl from\nus_.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Yes. One or two little things have cropped up. And your story, little\nlady, confirms my idea. They know we're looking for Jane Finn. Well,\nthey'll produce a Jane Finn of their own--say at a _pensionnat_ in\nParis.\" Tuppence gasped, and Mr. Carter smiled. \"No one knows in the\nleast what she looks like, so that's all right. She's primed with a\ntrumped-up tale, and her real business is to get as much information as\npossible out of us. See the idea?\"\n\n\"Then you think\"--Tuppence paused to grasp the supposition fully--\"that\nit _was_ as Jane Finn that they wanted me to go to Paris?\"\n\nMr. Carter smiled more wearily than ever.\n\n\"I believe in coincidences, you know,\" he said.\n\n\"WELL,\" said Tuppence, recovering herself, \"it really seems as though it\nwere meant to be.\"\n\nCarter nodded.\n\n\"I know what you mean. I'm superstitious myself. Luck, and all that sort\nof thing. Fate seems to have chosen you out to be mixed up in this.\"\n\nTommy indulged in a chuckle.\n\n\"My word! I don't wonder Whittington got the wind up when Tuppence\nplumped out that name! I should have myself. But look here, sir, we're\ntaking up an awful lot of your time. Have you any tips to give us before\nwe clear out?\"\n\n\"I think not. My experts, working in stereotyped ways, have failed.\nYou will bring imagination and an open mind to the task. Don't be\ndiscouraged if that too does not succeed. For one thing there is a\nlikelihood of the pace being forced.\"\n\nTuppence frowned uncomprehendingly.\n\n\"When you had that interview with Whittington, they had time before\nthem. I have information that the big _coup_ was planned for early in\nthe new year. But the Government is contemplating legislative action\nwhich will deal effectually with the strike menace. They'll get wind of\nit soon, if they haven't already, and it's possible that that may bring\nthings to a head.", "I hope it will myself. The less time they have to\nmature their plans the better. I'm just warning you that you haven't\nmuch time before you, and that you needn't be cast down if you fail.\nIt's not an easy proposition anyway. That's all.\"\n\nTuppence rose.\n\n\"I think we ought to be businesslike. What exactly can we count upon you\nfor, Mr. Carter?\" Mr. Carter's lips twitched slightly, but he replied\nsuccinctly: \"Funds within reason, detailed information on any point,\nand _no official recognition_. I mean that if you get yourselves into\ntrouble with the police, I can't officially help you out of it. You're\non your own.\"\n\nTuppence nodded sagely.\n\n\"I quite understand that. I'll write out a list of the things I want to\nknow when I've had time to think. Now--about money----\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Tuppence. Do you want to say how much?\"\n\n\"Not exactly. We've got plenty to go with for the present, but when we\nwant more----\"\n\n\"It will be waiting for you.\"\n\n\"Yes, but--I'm sure I don't want to be rude about the Government if\nyou've got anything to do with it, but you know one really has the devil\nof a time getting anything out of it! And if we have to fill up a blue\nform and send it in, and then, after three months, they send us a green\none, and so on--well, that won't be much use, will it?\"\n\nMr. Carter laughed outright.\n\n\"Don't worry, Miss Tuppence. You will send a personal demand to me here,\nand the money, in notes, shall be sent by return of post. As to salary,\nshall we say at the rate of three hundred a year? And an equal sum for\nMr. Beresford, of course.\"\n\nTuppence beamed upon him.\n\n\"How lovely. You are kind. I do love money! I'll keep beautiful accounts\nof our expenses all debit and credit, and the balance on the right side,\nand red line drawn sideways with the totals the same at the bottom. I\nreally know how to do it when I think.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you do.", "Well, good-bye, and good luck to you both.\"\n\nHe shook hands with them, and in another minute they were descending the\nsteps of 27 Carshalton Terrace with their heads in a whirl.\n\n\"Tommy! Tell me at once, who is 'Mr. Carter'?\"\n\nTommy murmured a name in her ear.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence, impressed.\n\n\"And I can tell you, old bean, he's IT!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence again. Then she added reflectively,\n\n\"I like him, don't you? He looks so awfully tired and bored, and yet you\nfeel that underneath he's just like steel, all keen and flashing. Oh!\"\n She gave a skip. \"Pinch me, Tommy, do pinch me. I can't believe it's\nreal!\"\n\nMr. Beresford obliged.\n\n\"Ow! That's enough! Yes, we're not dreaming. We've got a job!\"\n\n\"And what a job! The joint venture has really begun.\"\n\n\"It's more respectable than I thought it would be,\" said Tuppence\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"Luckily I haven't got your craving for crime! What time is it? Let's\nhave lunch--oh!\"\n\nThe same thought sprang to the minds of each. Tommy voiced it first.\n\n\"Julius P. Hersheimmer!\"\n\n\"We never told Mr. Carter about hearing from him.\"\n\n\"Well, there wasn't much to tell--not till we've seen him. Come on, we'd\nbetter take a taxi.\"\n\n\"Now who's being extravagant?\"\n\n\"All expenses paid, remember. Hop in.\"\n\n\"At any rate, we shall make a better effect arriving this way,\" said\nTuppence, leaning back luxuriously. \"I'm sure blackmailers never arrive\nin buses!\"\n\n\"We've ceased being blackmailers,\" Tommy pointed out.\n\n\"I'm not sure I have,\" said Tuppence darkly.\n\nOn inquiring for Mr. Hersheimmer, they were at once taken up to his\nsuite. An impatient voice cried \"Come in\" in answer to the page-boy's\nknock, and the lad stood aside to let them pass in.\n\nMr. Julius P. Hersheimmer was a great deal younger than either Tommy or\nTuppence had pictured him. The girl put him down as thirty-five. He\nwas of middle height, and squarely built to match his jaw. His face was\npugnacious but pleasant. No one could have mistaken him for anything but\nan American, though he spoke with very little accent.", "\"Get my note? Sit down and tell me right away all you know about my\ncousin.\"\n\n\"Your cousin?\"\n\n\"Sure thing. Jane Finn.\"\n\n\"Is she your cousin?\"\n\n\"My father and her mother were brother and sister,\" explained Mr.\nHersheimmer meticulously.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Tuppence. \"Then you know where she is?\"\n\n\"No!\" Mr. Hersheimmer brought down his fist with a bang on the table.\n\"I'm darned if I do! Don't you?\"\n\n\"We advertised to receive information, not to give it,\" said Tuppence\nseverely.\n\n\"I guess I know that. I can read. But I thought maybe it was her back\nhistory you were after, and that you'd know where she was now?\"\n\n\"Well, we wouldn't mind hearing her back history,\" said Tuppence\nguardedly.\n\nBut Mr. Hersheimmer seemed to grow suddenly suspicious.\n\n\"See here,\" he declared. \"This isn't Sicily! No demanding ransom or\nthreatening to crop her ears if I refuse. These are the British Isles,\nso quit the funny business, or I'll just sing out for that beautiful big\nBritish policeman I see out there in Piccadilly.\"\n\nTommy hastened to explain.\n\n\"We haven't kidnapped your cousin. On the contrary, we're trying to find\nher. We're employed to do so.\"\n\nMr. Hersheimmer leant back in his chair.\n\n\"Put me wise,\" he said succinctly.\n\nTommy fell in with this demand in so far as he gave him a guarded\nversion of the disappearance of Jane Finn, and of the possibility of her\nhaving been mixed up unawares in \"some political show.\" He alluded to\nTuppence and himself as \"private inquiry agents\" commissioned to find\nher, and added that they would therefore be glad of any details Mr.\nHersheimmer could give them.\n\nThat gentleman nodded approval.\n\n\"I guess that's all right. I was just a mite hasty. But London gets my\ngoat! I only know little old New York. Just trot out your questions and\nI'll answer.\"\n\nFor the moment this paralysed the Young Adventurers, but Tuppence,\nrecovering herself, plunged boldly into the breach with a reminiscence\nculled from detective fiction.\n\n\"When did you last see the dece--your cousin, I mean?\"\n\n\"Never seen her,\" responded Mr.", "Hersheimmer.\n\n\"What?\" demanded Tommy, astonished.\n\nHersheimmer turned to him.\n\n\"No, sir. As I said before, my father and her mother were brother and\nsister, just as you might be\"--Tommy did not correct this view of their\nrelationship--\"but they didn't always get on together. And when my aunt\nmade up her mind to marry Amos Finn, who was a poor school teacher out\nWest, my father was just mad! Said if he made his pile, as he seemed\nin a fair way to do, she'd never see a cent of it. Well, the upshot was\nthat Aunt Jane went out West and we never heard from her again.\n\n\"The old man _did_ pile it up. He went into oil, and he went into steel,\nand he played a bit with railroads, and I can tell you he made Wall\nStreet sit up!\" He paused. \"Then he died--last fall--and I got the\ndollars. Well, would you believe it, my conscience got busy! Kept\nknocking me up and saying: What about your Aunt Jane, way out West? It\nworried me some. You see, I figured it out that Amos Finn would never\nmake good. He wasn't the sort. End of it was, I hired a man to hunt her\ndown. Result, she was dead, and Amos Finn was dead, but they'd left a\ndaughter--Jane--who'd been torpedoed in the _Lusitania_ on her way to\nParis. She was saved all right, but they didn't seem able to hear of her\nover this side. I guessed they weren't hustling any, so I thought I'd\ncome along over, and speed things up. I phoned Scotland Yard and the\nAdmiralty first thing. The Admiralty rather choked me off, but Scotland\nYard were very civil--said they would make inquiries, even sent a man\nround this morning to get her photograph. I'm off to Paris to-morrow,\njust to see what the Prefecture is doing. I guess if I go to and fro\nhustling them, they ought to get busy!\"\n\nThe energy of Mr. Hersheimmer was tremendous. They bowed before it.\n\n\"But say now,\" he ended, \"you're not after her for anything?", "Contempt of\ncourt, or something British? A proud-spirited young American girl might\nfind your rules and regulations in war time rather irksome, and get up\nagainst it. If that's the case, and there's such a thing as graft in\nthis country, I'll buy her off.\"\n\nTuppence reassured him.\n\n\"That's good. Then we can work together. What about some lunch? Shall we\nhave it up here, or go down to the restaurant?\"\n\nTuppence expressed a preference for the latter, and Julius bowed to her\ndecision.\n\nOysters had just given place to Sole Colbert when a card was brought to\nHersheimmer.\n\n\"Inspector Japp, C.I.D. Scotland Yard again. Another man this time. What\ndoes he expect I can tell him that I didn't tell the first chap? I hope\nthey haven't lost that photograph. That Western photographer's place was\nburned down and all his negatives destroyed--this is the only copy in\nexistence. I got it from the principal of the college there.\"\n\nAn unformulated dread swept over Tuppence.\n\n\"You--you don't know the name of the man who came this morning?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do. No, I don't. Half a second. It was on his card. Oh, I know!\nInspector Brown. Quiet, unassuming sort of chap.\"\n\nA veil might with profit be drawn over the events of the next half-hour.\nSuffice it to say that no such person as \"Inspector Brown\" was known to\nScotland Yard. The photograph of Jane Finn, which would have been of\nthe utmost value to the police in tracing her, was lost beyond recovery.\nOnce again \"Mr. Brown\" had triumphed.\n\nThe immediate result of this set-back was to effect a _rapprochement_\nbetween Julius Hersheimmer and the Young Adventurers. All barriers went\ndown with a crash, and Tommy and Tuppence felt they had known the young\nAmerican all their lives. They abandoned the discreet reticence of\n\"private inquiry agents,\" and revealed to him the whole history of\nthe joint venture, whereat the young man declared himself \"tickled to\ndeath.\"\n\nHe turned to Tuppence at the close of the narration.\n\n\"I've always had a kind of idea that English girls were just a mite\nmoss-grown.", "Old-fashioned and sweet, you know, but scared to move round\nwithout a footman or a maiden aunt. I guess I'm a bit behind the times!\"\n\nThe upshot of these confidential relations was that Tommy and Tuppence\ntook up their abode forthwith at the _Ritz_, in order, as Tuppence put\nit, to keep in touch with Jane Finn's only living relation. \"And put\nlike that,\" she added confidentially to Tommy, \"nobody could boggle at\nthe expense!\"\n\nNobody did, which was the great thing.\n\n\"And now,\" said the young lady on the morning after their installation,\n\"to work!\"\n\nMr. Beresford put down the _Daily Mail_, which he was reading, and\napplauded with somewhat unnecessary vigour. He was politely requested by\nhis colleague not to be an ass.\n\n\"Dash it all, Tommy, we've got to _do_ something for our money.\"\n\nTommy sighed.\n\n\"Yes, I fear even the dear old Government will not support us at the\n_Ritz_ in idleness for ever.\"\n\n\"Therefore, as I said before, we must _do_ something.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Tommy, picking up the _Daily Mail_ again, \"_do_ it. I\nshan't stop you.\"\n\n\"You see,\" continued Tuppence. \"I've been thinking----\"\n\nShe was interrupted by a fresh bout of applause.\n\n\"It's all very well for you to sit there being funny, Tommy. It would do\nyou no harm to do a little brain work too.\"\n\n\"My union, Tuppence, my union! It does not permit me to work before 11\na.m.\"\n\n\"Tommy, do you want something thrown at you? It is absolutely essential\nthat we should without delay map out a plan of campaign.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\"\n\n\"Well, let's do it.\"\n\nTommy laid his paper finally aside. \"There's something of the simplicity\nof the truly great mind about you, Tuppence. Fire ahead. I'm listening.\"\n\n\"To begin with,\" said Tuppence, \"what have we to go upon?\"\n\n\"Absolutely nothing,\" said Tommy cheerily.\n\n\"Wrong!\" Tuppence wagged an energetic finger. \"We have two distinct\nclues.\"\n\n\"What are they?\"\n\n\"First clue, we know one of the gang.\"\n\n\"Whittington?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'd recognize him anywhere.\"\n\n\"Hum,\" said Tommy doubtfully, \"I don't call that much of a clue. You\ndon't know where to look for him, and it's about a thousand to one\nagainst your running against him by accident.\"", "\"I'm not so sure about that,\" replied Tuppence thoughtfully. \"I've often\nnoticed that once coincidences start happening they go on happening in\nthe most extraordinary way. I dare say it's some natural law that we\nhaven't found out. Still, as you say, we can't rely on that. But there\n_are_ places in London where simply every one is bound to turn up sooner\nor later. Piccadilly Circus, for instance. One of my ideas was to take\nup my stand there every day with a tray of flags.\"\n\n\"What about meals?\" inquired the practical Tommy.\n\n\"How like a man! What does mere food matter?\"\n\n\"That's all very well. You've just had a thundering good breakfast. No\none's got a better appetite than you have, Tuppence, and by tea-time\nyou'd be eating the flags, pins and all. But, honestly, I don't think\nmuch of the idea. Whittington mayn't be in London at all.\"\n\n\"That's true. Anyway, I think clue No. 2 is more promising.\"\n\n\"Let's hear it.\"\n\n\"It's nothing much. Only a Christian name--Rita. Whittington mentioned\nit that day.\"\n\n\"Are you proposing a third advertisement: Wanted, female crook,\nanswering to the name of Rita?\"\n\n\"I am not. I propose to reason in a logical manner. That man, Danvers,\nwas shadowed on the way over, wasn't he? And it's more likely to have\nbeen a woman than a man----\"\n\n\"I don't see that at all.\"\n\n\"I am absolutely certain that it would be a woman, and a good-looking\none,\" replied Tuppence calmly.\n\n\"On these technical points I bow to your decision,\" murmured Mr.\nBeresford.\n\n\"Now, obviously this woman, whoever she was, was saved.\"\n\n\"How do you make that out?\"\n\n\"If she wasn't, how would they have known Jane Finn had got the papers?\"\n\n\"Correct. Proceed, O Sherlock!\"\n\n\"Now there's just a chance, I admit it's only a chance, that this woman\nmay have been 'Rita.'\"\n\n\"And if so?\"\n\n\"If so, we've got to hunt through the survivors of the _Lusitania_ till\nwe find her.\"\n\n\"Then the first thing is to get a list of the survivors.\"\n\n\"I've got it. I wrote a long list of things I wanted to know, and sent\nit to Mr.", "Carter. I got his reply this morning, and among other things\nit encloses the official statement of those saved from the _Lusitania_.\nHow's that for clever little Tuppence?\"\n\n\"Full marks for industry, zero for modesty. But the great point is, is\nthere a 'Rita' on the list?\"\n\n\"That's just what I don't know,\" confessed Tuppence.\n\n\"Don't know?\"\n\n\"Yes. Look here.\" Together they bent over the list. \"You see, very few\nChristian names are given. They're nearly all Mrs. or Miss.\"\n\nTommy nodded.\n\n\"That complicates matters,\" he murmured thoughtfully.\n\nTuppence gave her characteristic \"terrier\" shake.\n\n\"Well, we've just got to get down to it, that's all. We'll start with\nthe London area. Just note down the addresses of any of the females who\nlive in London or roundabout, while I put on my hat.\"\n\nFive minutes later the young couple emerged into Piccadilly, and a few\nseconds later a taxi was bearing them to The Laurels, Glendower Road,\nN.7, the residence of Mrs. Edgar Keith, whose name figured first in a\nlist of seven reposing in Tommy's pocket-book.\n\nThe Laurels was a dilapidated house, standing back from the road with\na few grimy bushes to support the fiction of a front garden. Tommy paid\noff the taxi, and accompanied Tuppence to the front door bell. As she\nwas about to ring it, he arrested her hand.\n\n\"What are you going to say?\"\n\n\"What am I going to say? Why, I shall say--Oh dear, I don't know. It's\nvery awkward.\"\n\n\"I thought as much,\" said Tommy with satisfaction. \"How like a woman! No\nforesight! Now just stand aside, and see how easily the mere male\ndeals with the situation.\" He pressed the bell. Tuppence withdrew to a\nsuitable spot.\n\nA slatternly looking servant, with an extremely dirty face and a pair of\neyes that did not match, answered the door.\n\nTommy had produced a notebook and pencil.\n\n\"Good morning,\" he said briskly and cheerfully. \"From the Hampstead\nBorough Council. The new Voting Register. Mrs. Edgar Keith lives here,\ndoes she not?\"\n\n\"Yaas,\" said the servant.\n\n\"Christian name?\" asked Tommy, his pencil poised.", "\"Missus's? Eleanor Jane.\"\n\n\"Eleanor,\" spelt Tommy. \"Any sons or daughters over twenty-one?\"\n\n\"Naow.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" Tommy closed the notebook with a brisk snap. \"Good\nmorning.\"\n\nThe servant volunteered her first remark:\n\n\"I thought perhaps as you'd come about the gas,\" she observed\ncryptically, and shut the door.\n\nTommy rejoined his accomplice.\n\n\"You see, Tuppence,\" he observed. \"Child's play to the masculine mind.\"\n\n\"I don't mind admitting that for once you've scored handsomely. I should\nnever have thought of that.\"\n\n\"Good wheeze, wasn't it? And we can repeat it _ad lib_.\"\n\nLunch-time found the young couple attacking a steak and chips in an\nobscure hostelry with avidity. They had collected a Gladys Mary and a\nMarjorie, been baffled by one change of address, and had been forced to\nlisten to a long lecture on universal suffrage from a vivacious American\nlady whose Christian name had proved to be Sadie.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Tommy, imbibing a long draught of beer, \"I feel better.\nWhere's the next draw?\"\n\nThe notebook lay on the table between them. Tuppence picked it up.\n\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer,\" she read, \"20 South Audley Mansions. Miss Wheeler, 43\nClapington Road, Battersea. She's a lady's maid, as far as I remember,\nso probably won't be there, and, anyway, she's not likely.\"\n\n\"Then the Mayfair lady is clearly indicated as the first port of call.\"\n\n\"Tommy, I'm getting discouraged.\"\n\n\"Buck up, old bean. We always knew it was an outside chance. And,\nanyway, we're only starting. If we draw a blank in London, there's a\nfine tour of England, Ireland and Scotland before us.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Tuppence, her flagging spirits reviving. \"And all expenses\npaid! But, oh, Tommy, I do like things to happen quickly. So far,\nadventure has succeeded adventure, but this morning has been dull as\ndull.\"\n\n\"You must stifle this longing for vulgar sensation, Tuppence. Remember\nthat if Mr. Brown is all he is reported to be, it's a wonder that he has\nnot ere now done us to death. That's a good sentence, quite a literary\nflavour about it.\"\n\n\"You're really more conceited than I am--with less excuse!", "Ahem! But it\ncertainly is queer that Mr. Brown has not yet wreaked vengeance upon us.\n(You see, I can do it too.) We pass on our way unscathed.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he doesn't think us worth bothering about,\" suggested the young\nman simply.\n\nTuppence received the remark with great disfavour.\n\n\"How horrid you are, Tommy. Just as though we didn't count.\"\n\n\"Sorry, Tuppence. What I meant was that we work like moles in the dark,\nand that he has no suspicion of our nefarious schemes. Ha ha!\"\n\n\"Ha ha!\" echoed Tuppence approvingly, as she rose.\n\nSouth Audley Mansions was an imposing-looking block of flats just off\nPark Lane. No. 20 was on the second floor.\n\nTommy had by this time the glibness born of practice. He rattled off\nthe formula to the elderly woman, looking more like a housekeeper than a\nservant, who opened the door to him.\n\n\"Christian name?\"\n\n\"Margaret.\"\n\nTommy spelt it, but the other interrupted him.\n\n\"No, _g u e_.\"\n\n\"Oh, Marguerite; French way, I see.\" He paused, then plunged boldly. \"We\nhad her down as Rita Vandemeyer, but I suppose that's incorrect?\"\n\n\"She's mostly called that, sir, but Marguerite's her name.\"\n\n\"Thank you. That's all. Good morning.\"\n\nHardly able to contain his excitement, Tommy hurried down the stairs.\nTuppence was waiting at the angle of the turn.\n\n\"You heard?\"\n\n\"Yes. Oh, _Tommy!_\"\n\nTommy squeezed her arm sympathetically.\n\n\"I know, old thing. I feel the same.\"\n\n\"It's--it's so lovely to think of things--and then for them really to\nhappen!\" cried Tuppence enthusiastically.\n\nHer hand was still in Tommy's. They had reached the entrance hall. There\nwere footsteps on the stairs above them, and voices.\n\nSuddenly, to Tommy's complete surprise, Tuppence dragged him into the\nlittle space by the side of the lift where the shadow was deepest.\n\n\"What the----\"\n\n\"Hush!\"\n\nTwo men came down the stairs and passed out through the entrance.\nTuppence's hand closed tighter on Tommy's arm.\n\n\"Quick--follow them. I daren't. He might recognize me. I don't know who\nthe other man is, but the bigger of the two was Whittington.\"\n\nWHITTINGTON and his companion were walking at a good pace.", "Tommy started\nin pursuit at once, and was in time to see them turn the corner of the\nstreet. His vigorous strides soon enabled him to gain upon them, and by\nthe time he, in his turn, reached the corner the distance between them\nwas sensibly lessened. The small Mayfair streets were comparatively\ndeserted, and he judged it wise to content himself with keeping them in\nsight.\n\nThe sport was a new one to him. Though familiar with the technicalities\nfrom a course of novel reading, he had never before attempted to\n\"follow\" anyone, and it appeared to him at once that, in actual\npractice, the proceeding was fraught with difficulties. Supposing, for\ninstance, that they should suddenly hail a taxi? In books, you simply\nleapt into another, promised the driver a sovereign--or its modern\nequivalent--and there you were. In actual fact, Tommy foresaw that it\nwas extremely likely there would be no second taxi. Therefore he\nwould have to run. What happened in actual fact to a young man who ran\nincessantly and persistently through the London streets? In a main road\nhe might hope to create the illusion that he was merely running for a\nbus. But in these obscure aristocratic byways he could not but feel that\nan officious policeman might stop him to explain matters.\n\nAt this juncture in his thoughts a taxi with flag erect turned the\ncorner of the street ahead. Tommy held his breath. Would they hail it?\n\nHe drew a sigh of relief as they allowed it to pass unchallenged. Their\ncourse was a zigzag one designed to bring them as quickly as possible\nto Oxford Street. When at length they turned into it, proceeding in an\neasterly direction, Tommy slightly increased his pace. Little by little\nhe gained upon them. On the crowded pavement there was little chance of\nhis attracting their notice, and he was anxious if possible to catch\na word or two of their conversation. In this he was completely\nfoiled; they spoke low and the din of the traffic drowned their voices\neffectually.\n\nJust before the Bond Street Tube station they crossed the road, Tommy,\nunperceived, faithfully at their heels, and entered the big Lyons'.", "There they went up to the first floor, and sat at a small table in the\nwindow. It was late, and the place was thinning out. Tommy took a seat\nat the table next to them, sitting directly behind Whittington in case\nof recognition. On the other hand, he had a full view of the second man\nand studied him attentively. He was fair, with a weak, unpleasant face,\nand Tommy put him down as being either a Russian or a Pole. He was\nprobably about fifty years of age, his shoulders cringed a little as he\ntalked, and his eyes, small and crafty, shifted unceasingly.\n\nHaving already lunched heartily, Tommy contented himself with ordering\na Welsh rarebit and a cup of coffee. Whittington ordered a substantial\nlunch for himself and his companion; then, as the waitress withdrew, he\nmoved his chair a little closer to the table and began to talk earnestly\nin a low voice. The other man joined in. Listen as he would, Tommy could\nonly catch a word here and there; but the gist of it seemed to be some\ndirections or orders which the big man was impressing on his companion,\nand with which the latter seemed from time to time to disagree.\nWhittington addressed the other as Boris.\n\nTommy caught the word \"Ireland\" several times, also \"propaganda,\" but\nof Jane Finn there was no mention. Suddenly, in a lull in the clatter of\nthe room, he got one phrase entire. Whittington was speaking. \"Ah, but\nyou don't know Flossie. She's a marvel. An archbishop would swear she\nwas his own mother. She gets the voice right every time, and that's\nreally the principal thing.\"\n\nTommy did not hear Boris's reply, but in response to it Whittington said\nsomething that sounded like: \"Of course--only in an emergency....\"\n\nThen he lost the thread again. But presently the phrases became distinct\nagain whether because the other two had insensibly raised their voices,\nor because Tommy's ears were getting more attuned, he could not tell.\nBut two words certainly had a most stimulating effect upon the listener.", "They were uttered by Boris and they were: \"Mr. Brown.\"\n\nWhittington seemed to remonstrate with him, but he merely laughed.\n\n\"Why not, my friend? It is a name most respectable--most common. Did\nhe not choose it for that reason? Ah, I should like to meet him--Mr.\nBrown.\"\n\nThere was a steely ring in Whittington's voice as he replied:\n\n\"Who knows? You may have met him already.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" retorted the other. \"That is children's talk--a fable for the\npolice. Do you know what I say to myself sometimes? That he is a fable\ninvented by the Inner Ring, a bogy to frighten us with. It might be so.\"\n\n\"And it might not.\"\n\n\"I wonder ... or is it indeed true that he is with us and amongst us,\nunknown to all but a chosen few? If so, he keeps his secret well. And\nthe idea is a good one, yes. We never know. We look at each other--\n_one of us is Mr. Brown_--which? He commands--but also he serves. Among\nus--in the midst of us. And no one knows which he is....\"\n\nWith an effort the Russian shook off the vagary of his fancy. He looked\nat his watch.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Whittington. \"We might as well go.\"\n\nHe called the waitress and asked for his bill. Tommy did likewise, and a\nfew moments later was following the two men down the stairs.\n\nOutside, Whittington hailed a taxi, and directed the driver to go to\nWaterloo.\n\nTaxis were plentiful here, and before Whittington's had driven off\nanother was drawing up to the curb in obedience to Tommy's peremptory\nhand.\n\n\"Follow that other taxi,\" directed the young man. \"Don't lose it.\"\n\nThe elderly chauffeur showed no interest. He merely grunted and jerked\ndown his flag. The drive was uneventful. Tommy's taxi came to rest at\nthe departure platform just after Whittington's. Tommy was behind him at\nthe booking-office. He took a first-class single ticket to Bournemouth,\nTommy did the same. As he emerged, Boris remarked, glancing up at the\nclock: \"You are early. You have nearly half an hour.\"", "Boris's words had aroused a new train of thought in Tommy's mind.\nClearly Whittington was making the journey alone, while the other\nremained in London. Therefore he was left with a choice as to which he\nwould follow. Obviously, he could not follow both of them unless----\nLike Boris, he glanced up at the clock, and then to the announcement\nboard of the trains. The Bournemouth train left at 3.30. It was now ten\npast. Whittington and Boris were walking up and down by the bookstall.\nHe gave one doubtful look at them, then hurried into an adjacent\ntelephone box. He dared not waste time in trying to get hold of\nTuppence. In all probability she was still in the neighbourhood of South\nAudley Mansions. But there remained another ally. He rang up the _Ritz_\nand asked for Julius Hersheimmer. There was a click and a buzz. Oh, if\nonly the young American was in his room! There was another click, and\nthen \"Hello\" in unmistakable accents came over the wire.\n\n\"That you, Hersheimmer? Beresford speaking. I'm at Waterloo. I've\nfollowed Whittington and another man here. No time to explain.\nWhittington's off to Bournemouth by the 3.30. Can you get there by\nthen?\"\n\nThe reply was reassuring.\n\n\"Sure. I'll hustle.\"\n\nThe telephone rang off. Tommy put back the receiver with a sigh of\nrelief. His opinion of Julius's power of hustling was high. He felt\ninstinctively that the American would arrive in time.\n\nWhittington and Boris were still where he had left them. If Boris\nremained to see his friend off, all was well. Then Tommy fingered his\npocket thoughtfully. In spite of the carte blanche assured to him, he\nhad not yet acquired the habit of going about with any considerable sum\nof money on him. The taking of the first-class ticket to Bournemouth\nhad left him with only a few shillings in his pocket. It was to be hoped\nthat Julius would arrive better provided.\n\nIn the meantime, the minutes were creeping by: 3.15, 3.20, 3.25, 3.27.\nSupposing Julius did not get there in time. 3.29.... Doors were banging.\nTommy felt cold waves of despair pass over him.", "Then a hand fell on his\nshoulder.\n\n\"Here I am, son. Your British traffic beats description! Put me wise to\nthe crooks right away.\"\n\n\"That's Whittington--there, getting in now, that big dark man. The other\nis the foreign chap he's talking to.\"\n\n\"I'm on to them. Which of the two is my bird?\"\n\nTommy had thought out this question.\n\n\"Got any money with you?\"\n\nJulius shook his head, and Tommy's face fell.\n\n\"I guess I haven't more than three or four hundred dollars with me at\nthe moment,\" explained the American.\n\nTommy gave a faint whoop of relief.\n\n\"Oh, Lord, you millionaires! You don't talk the same language! Climb\naboard the lugger. Here's your ticket. Whittington's your man.\"\n\n\"Me for Whittington!\" said Julius darkly. The train was just starting\nas he swung himself aboard. \"So long, Tommy.\" The train slid out of the\nstation.\n\nTommy drew a deep breath. The man Boris was coming along the platform\ntowards him. Tommy allowed him to pass and then took up the chase once\nmore.\n\nFrom Waterloo Boris took the tube as far as Piccadilly Circus. Then he\nwalked up Shaftesbury Avenue, finally turning off into the maze of mean\nstreets round Soho. Tommy followed him at a judicious distance.\n\nThey reached at length a small dilapidated square. The houses there had\na sinister air in the midst of their dirt and decay. Boris looked round,\nand Tommy drew back into the shelter of a friendly porch. The place was\nalmost deserted. It was a cul-de-sac, and consequently no traffic passed\nthat way. The stealthy way the other had looked round stimulated Tommy's\nimagination. From the shelter of the doorway he watched him go up the\nsteps of a particularly evil-looking house and rap sharply, with a\npeculiar rhythm, on the door. It was opened promptly, he said a word or\ntwo to the doorkeeper, then passed inside. The door was shut to again.\n\nIt was at this juncture that Tommy lost his head. What he ought to have\ndone, what any sane man would have done, was to remain patiently where\nhe was and wait for his man to come out again.", "What he did do was\nentirely foreign to the sober common sense which was, as a rule, his\nleading characteristic. Something, as he expressed it, seemed to snap in\nhis brain. Without a moment's pause for reflection he, too, went up the\nsteps, and reproduced as far as he was able the peculiar knock.\n\nThe door swung open with the same promptness as before. A\nvillainous-faced man with close-cropped hair stood in the doorway.\n\n\"Well?\" he grunted.\n\nIt was at that moment that the full realization of his folly began to\ncome home to Tommy. But he dared not hesitate. He seized at the first\nwords that came into his mind.\n\n\"Mr. Brown?\" he said.\n\nTo his surprise the man stood aside.\n\n\"Upstairs,\" he said, jerking his thumb over his shoulder, \"second door\non your left.\"\n\nTAKEN aback though he was by the man's words, Tommy did not hesitate.\nIf audacity had successfully carried him so far, it was to be hoped\nit would carry him yet farther. He quietly passed into the house and\nmounted the ramshackle staircase. Everything in the house was filthy\nbeyond words. The grimy paper, of a pattern now indistinguishable,\nhung in loose festoons from the wall. In every angle was a grey mass of\ncobweb.\n\nTommy proceeded leisurely. By the time he reached the bend of the\nstaircase, he had heard the man below disappear into a back room.\nClearly no suspicion attached to him as yet. To come to the house and\nask for \"Mr. Brown\" appeared indeed to be a reasonable and natural\nproceeding.\n\nAt the top of the stairs Tommy halted to consider his next move. In\nfront of him ran a narrow passage, with doors opening on either side of\nit. From the one nearest him on the left came a low murmur of voices.\nIt was this room which he had been directed to enter. But what held\nhis glance fascinated was a small recess immediately on his right,\nhalf concealed by a torn velvet curtain. It was directly opposite the\nleft-handed door and, owing to its angle, it also commanded a good view\nof the upper part of the staircase.", "As a hiding-place for one or, at a\npinch, two men, it was ideal, being about two feet deep and three feet\nwide. It attracted Tommy mightily. He thought things over in his usual\nslow and steady way, deciding that the mention of \"Mr. Brown\" was not a\nrequest for an individual, but in all probability a password used by\nthe gang. His lucky use of it had gained him admission. So far he had\naroused no suspicion. But he must decide quickly on his next step.\n\nSuppose he were boldly to enter the room on the left of the passage.\nWould the mere fact of his having been admitted to the house be\nsufficient? Perhaps a further password would be required, or, at any\nrate, some proof of identity. The doorkeeper clearly did not know all\nthe members of the gang by sight, but it might be different upstairs.\nOn the whole it seemed to him that luck had served him very well so far,\nbut that there was such a thing as trusting it too far. To enter\nthat room was a colossal risk. He could not hope to sustain his part\nindefinitely; sooner or later he was almost bound to betray himself, and\nthen he would have thrown away a vital chance in mere foolhardiness.\n\nA repetition of the signal knock sounded on the door below, and Tommy,\nhis mind made up, slipped quickly into the recess, and cautiously drew\nthe curtain farther across so that it shielded him completely from\nsight. There were several rents and slits in the ancient material which\nafforded him a good view. He would watch events, and any time he chose\ncould, after all, join the assembly, modelling his behaviour on that of\nthe new arrival.\n\nThe man who came up the staircase with a furtive, soft-footed tread was\nquite unknown to Tommy. He was obviously of the very dregs of society.\nThe low beetling brows, and the criminal jaw, the bestiality of the\nwhole countenance were new to the young man, though he was a type that\nScotland Yard would have recognized at a glance.", "The man passed the recess, breathing heavily as he went. He stopped at\nthe door opposite, and gave a repetition of the signal knock. A voice\ninside called out something, and the man opened the door and passed in,\naffording Tommy a momentary glimpse of the room inside. He thought there\nmust be about four or five people seated round a long table that took up\nmost of the space, but his attention was caught and held by a tall man\nwith close-cropped hair and a short, pointed, naval-looking beard,\nwho sat at the head of the table with papers in front of him. As the\nnew-comer entered he glanced up, and with a correct, but curiously\nprecise enunciation, which attracted Tommy's notice, he asked:\n\n\"Your number, comrade?\"\n\n\"Fourteen, gov'nor,\" replied the other hoarsely.\n\n\"Correct.\"\n\nThe door shut again.\n\n\"If that isn't a Hun, I'm a Dutchman!\" said Tommy to himself. \"And\nrunning the show darned systematically too--as they always do. Lucky I\ndidn't roll in. I'd have given the wrong number, and there would have\nbeen the deuce to pay. No, this is the place for me. Hullo, here's\nanother knock.\"\n\nThis visitor proved to be of an entirely different type to the last.\nTommy recognized in him an Irish Sinn Feiner. Certainly Mr. Brown's\norganization was a far-reaching concern. The common criminal, the\nwell-bred Irish gentleman, the pale Russian, and the efficient German\nmaster of the ceremonies! Truly a strange and sinister gathering! Who\nwas this man who held in his finger these curiously variegated links of\nan unknown chain?\n\nIn this case, the procedure was exactly the same. The signal knock, the\ndemand for a number, and the reply \"Correct.\"\n\nTwo knocks followed in quick succession on the door below. The first man\nwas quite unknown to Tommy, who put him down as a city clerk. A quiet,\nintelligent-looking man, rather shabbily dressed. The second was of the\nworking classes, and his face was vaguely familiar to the young man.\n\nThree minutes later came another, a man of commanding appearance,\nexquisitely dressed, and evidently well born.", "His face, again, was not\nunknown to the watcher, though he could not for the moment put a name to\nit.\n\nAfter his arrival there was a long wait. In fact Tommy concluded that\nthe gathering was now complete, and was just cautiously creeping out\nfrom his hiding-place, when another knock sent him scuttling back to\ncover.\n\nThis last-comer came up the stairs so quietly that he was almost abreast\nof Tommy before the young man had realized his presence.\n\nHe was a small man, very pale, with a gentle almost womanish air. The\nangle of the cheek-bones hinted at his Slavonic ancestry, otherwise\nthere was nothing to indicate his nationality. As he passed the recess,\nhe turned his head slowly. The strange light eyes seemed to burn through\nthe curtain; Tommy could hardly believe that the man did not know he was\nthere and in spite of himself he shivered. He was no more fanciful than\nthe majority of young Englishmen, but he could not rid himself of the\nimpression that some unusually potent force emanated from the man. The\ncreature reminded him of a venomous snake.\n\nA moment later his impression was proved correct. The new-comer knocked\non the door as all had done, but his reception was very different. The\nbearded man rose to his feet, and all the others followed suit. The\nGerman came forward and shook hands. His heels clicked together.\n\n\"We are honoured,\" he said. \"We are greatly honoured. I much feared that\nit would be impossible.\"\n\nThe other answered in a low voice that had a kind of hiss in it:\n\n\"There were difficulties. It will not be possible again, I fear. But one\nmeeting is essential--to define my policy. I can do nothing without--Mr.\nBrown. He is here?\"\n\nThe change in the German's voice was audible as he replied with slight\nhesitation:\n\n\"We have received a message. It is impossible for him to be present\nin person.\" He stopped, giving a curious impression of having left the\nsentence unfinished.\n\nA very slow smile overspread the face of the other.", "He looked round at a\ncircle of uneasy faces.\n\n\"Ah! I understand. I have read of his methods. He works in the dark and\ntrusts no one. But, all the same, it is possible that he is among us\nnow....\" He looked round him again, and again that expression of fear\nswept over the group. Each man seemed eyeing his neighbour doubtfully.\n\nThe Russian tapped his cheek.\n\n\"So be it. Let us proceed.\"\n\nThe German seemed to pull himself together. He indicated the place he\nhad been occupying at the head of the table. The Russian demurred, but\nthe other insisted.\n\n\"It is the only possible place,\" he said, \"for--Number One. Perhaps\nNumber Fourteen will shut the door?\"\n\nIn another moment Tommy was once more confronting bare wooden panels,\nand the voices within had sunk once more to a mere undistinguishable\nmurmur. Tommy became restive. The conversation he had overheard had\nstimulated his curiosity. He felt that, by hook or by crook, he must\nhear more.\n\nThere was no sound from below, and it did not seem likely that the\ndoorkeeper would come upstairs. After listening intently for a minute or\ntwo, he put his head round the curtain. The passage was deserted. Tommy\nbent down and removed his shoes, then, leaving them behind the curtain,\nhe walked gingerly out on his stockinged feet, and kneeling down by\nthe closed door he laid his ear cautiously to the crack. To his intense\nannoyance he could distinguish little more; just a chance word here and\nthere if a voice was raised, which merely served to whet his curiosity\nstill farther.\n\nHe eyed the handle of the door tentatively. Could he turn it by degrees\nso gently and imperceptibly that those in the room would notice nothing?\nHe decided that with great care it could be done. Very slowly, a\nfraction of an inch at a time, he moved it round, holding his breath in\nhis excessive care. A little more--a little more still--would it never\nbe finished? Ah! at last it would turn no farther.\n\nHe stayed so for a minute or two, then drew a deep breath, and pressed\nit ever so slightly inward.", "The door did not budge. Tommy was annoyed.\nIf he had to use too much force, it would almost certainly creak.\nHe waited until the voices rose a little, then he tried again. Still\nnothing happened. He increased the pressure. Had the beastly thing\nstuck? Finally, in desperation, he pushed with all his might. But the\ndoor remained firm, and at last the truth dawned upon him. It was locked\nor bolted on the inside.\n\nFor a moment or two Tommy's indignation got the better of him.\n\n\"Well, I'm damned!\" he said. \"What a dirty trick!\"\n\nAs his indignation cooled, he prepared to face the situation. Clearly\nthe first thing to be done was to restore the handle to its original\nposition. If he let it go suddenly, the men inside would be almost\ncertain to notice it, so, with the same infinite pains, he reversed his\nformer tactics. All went well, and with a sigh of relief the young man\nrose to his feet. There was a certain bulldog tenacity about Tommy that\nmade him slow to admit defeat. Checkmated for the moment, he was far\nfrom abandoning the conflict. He still intended to hear what was going\non in the locked room. As one plan had failed, he must hunt about for\nanother.\n\nHe looked round him. A little farther along the passage on the left was\na second door. He slipped silently along to it. He listened for a moment\nor two, then tried the handle. It yielded, and he slipped inside.\n\nThe room, which was untenanted, was furnished as a bedroom. Like\neverything else in the house, the furniture was falling to pieces, and\nthe dirt was, if anything, more abundant.\n\nBut what interested Tommy was the thing he had hoped to find, a\ncommunicating door between the two rooms, up on the left by the window.\nCarefully closing the door into the passage behind him, he stepped\nacross to the other and examined it closely. The bolt was shot across\nit. It was very rusty, and had clearly not been used for some time. By\ngently wriggling it to and fro, Tommy managed to draw it back without\nmaking too much noise.", "Then he repeated his former manoeuvres with the\nhandle--this time with complete success. The door swung open--a crack,\na mere fraction, but enough for Tommy to hear what went on. There was a\nvelvet _portiere_ on the inside of this door which prevented him from\nseeing, but he was able to recognize the voices with a reasonable amount\nof accuracy.\n\nThe Sinn Feiner was speaking. His rich Irish voice was unmistakable:\n\n\"That's all very well. But more money is essential. No money--no\nresults!\"\n\nAnother voice which Tommy rather thought was that of Boris replied:\n\n\"Will you guarantee that there _are_ results?\"\n\n\"In a month from now--sooner or later as you wish--I will guarantee you\nsuch a reign of terror in Ireland as shall shake the British Empire to\nits foundations.\"\n\nThere was a pause, and then came the soft, sibilant accents of Number\nOne:\n\n\"Good! You shall have the money. Boris, you will see to that.\"\n\nBoris asked a question:\n\n\"Via the Irish Americans, and Mr. Potter as usual?\"\n\n\"I guess that'll be all right!\" said a new voice, with a transatlantic\nintonation, \"though I'd like to point out, here and now, that things\nare getting a mite difficult. There's not the sympathy there was, and\na growing disposition to let the Irish settle their own affairs without\ninterference from America.\"\n\nTommy felt that Boris had shrugged his shoulders as he answered:\n\n\"Does that matter, since the money only nominally comes from the\nStates?\"\n\n\"The chief difficulty is the landing of the ammunition,\" said the Sinn\nFeiner. \"The money is conveyed in easily enough--thanks to our colleague\nhere.\"\n\nAnother voice, which Tommy fancied was that of the tall,\ncommanding-looking man whose face had seemed familiar to him, said:\n\n\"Think of the feelings of Belfast if they could hear you!\"\n\n\"That is settled, then,\" said the sibilant tones. \"Now, in the matter\nof the loan to an English newspaper, you have arranged the details\nsatisfactorily, Boris?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"That is good. An official denial from Moscow will be forthcoming if\nnecessary.\"\n\nThere was a pause, and then the clear voice of the German broke the\nsilence:\n\n\"I am directed by--Mr.", "Brown, to place the summaries of the reports\nfrom the different unions before you. That of the miners is most\nsatisfactory. We must hold back the railways. There may be trouble with\nthe A.S.E.\"\n\nFor a long time there was a silence, broken only by the rustle of papers\nand an occasional word of explanation from the German. Then Tommy heard\nthe light tap-tap of fingers, drumming on the table.\n\n\"And--the date, my friend?\" said Number One.\n\n\"The 29th.\"\n\nThe Russian seemed to consider:\n\n\"That is rather soon.\"\n\n\"I know. But it was settled by the principal Labour leaders, and we\ncannot seem to interfere too much. They must believe it to be entirely\ntheir own show.\"\n\nThe Russian laughed softly, as though amused.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he said. \"That is true. They must have no inkling that we\nare using them for our own ends. They are honest men--and that is their\nvalue to us. It is curious--but you cannot make a revolution without\nhonest men. The instinct of the populace is infallible.\" He paused, and\nthen repeated, as though the phrase pleased him: \"Every revolution has\nhad its honest men. They are soon disposed of afterwards.\"\n\nThere was a sinister note in his voice.\n\nThe German resumed:\n\n\"Clymes must go. He is too far-seeing. Number Fourteen will see to\nthat.\"\n\nThere was a hoarse murmur.\n\n\"That's all right, gov'nor.\" And then after a moment or two: \"Suppose\nI'm nabbed.\"\n\n\"You will have the best legal talent to defend you,\" replied the\nGerman quietly. \"But in any case you will wear gloves fitted with the\nfinger-prints of a notorious housebreaker. You have little to fear.\"\n\n\"Oh, I ain't afraid, gov'nor. All for the good of the cause. The streets\nis going to run with blood, so they say.\" He spoke with a grim relish.\n\"Dreams of it, sometimes, I does. And diamonds and pearls rolling about\nin the gutter for anyone to pick up!\"\n\nTommy heard a chair shifted. Then Number One spoke:\n\n\"Then all is arranged. We are assured of success?\"", "\"I--think so.\" But the German spoke with less than his usual confidence.\n\nNumber One's voice held suddenly a dangerous quality:\n\n\"What has gone wrong?\"\n\n\"Nothing; but----\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"The Labour leaders. Without them, as you say, we can do nothing. If\nthey do not declare a general strike on the 29th----\"\n\n\"Why should they not?\"\n\n\"As you've said, they're honest. And, in spite of everything we've\ndone to discredit the Government in their eyes, I'm not sure that they\nhaven't got a sneaking faith and belief in it.\"\n\n\"But----\"\n\n\"I know. They abuse it unceasingly. But, on the whole, public opinion\nswings to the side of the Government. They will not go against it.\"\n\nAgain the Russian's fingers drummed on the table.\n\n\"To the point, my friend. I was given to understand that there was a\ncertain document in existence which assured success.\"\n\n\"That is so. If that document were placed before the leaders, the result\nwould be immediate. They would publish it broadcast throughout England,\nand declare for the revolution without a moment's hesitation. The\nGovernment would be broken finally and completely.\"\n\n\"Then what more do you want?\"\n\n\"The document itself,\" said the German bluntly.\n\n\"Ah! It is not in your possession? But you know where it is?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Does anyone know where it is?\"\n\n\"One person--perhaps. And we are not sure of that even.\"\n\n\"Who is this person?\"\n\n\"A girl.\"\n\nTommy held his breath.\n\n\"A girl?\" The Russian's voice rose contemptuously. \"And you have not\nmade her speak? In Russia we have ways of making a girl talk.\"\n\n\"This case is different,\" said the German sullenly.\n\n\"How--different?\" He paused a moment, then went on: \"Where is the girl\nnow?\"\n\n\"The girl?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"She is----\"\n\nBut Tommy heard no more. A crashing blow descended on his head, and all\nwas darkness.\n\nWHEN Tommy set forth on the trail of the two men, it took all Tuppence's\nself-command to refrain from accompanying him. However, she contained\nherself as best she might, consoled by the reflection that her reasoning\nhad been justified by events. The two men had undoubtedly come from the\nsecond floor flat, and that one slender thread of the name \"Rita\" had\nset the Young Adventurers once more upon the track of the abductors of\nJane Finn.", "The question was what to do next? Tuppence hated letting the grass grow\nunder her feet. Tommy was amply employed, and debarred from joining him\nin the chase, the girl felt at a loose end. She retraced her steps\nto the entrance hall of the mansions. It was now tenanted by a small\nlift-boy, who was polishing brass fittings, and whistling the latest air\nwith a good deal of vigour and a reasonable amount of accuracy.\n\nHe glanced round at Tuppence's entry. There was a certain amount of the\ngamin element in the girl, at all events she invariably got on well\nwith small boys. A sympathetic bond seemed instantly to be formed. She\nreflected that an ally in the enemy's camp, so to speak, was not to be\ndespised.\n\n\"Well, William,\" she remarked cheerfully, in the best approved\nhospital-early-morning style, \"getting a good shine up?\"\n\nThe boy grinned responsively.\n\n\"Albert, miss,\" he corrected.\n\n\"Albert be it,\" said Tuppence. She glanced mysteriously round the hall.\nThe effect was purposely a broad one in case Albert should miss it. She\nleaned towards the boy and dropped her voice: \"I want a word with you,\nAlbert.\"\n\nAlbert ceased operations on the fittings and opened his mouth slightly.\n\n\"Look! Do you know what this is?\" With a dramatic gesture she flung back\nthe left side of her coat and exposed a small enamelled badge. It was\nextremely unlikely that Albert would have any knowledge of it--indeed,\nit would have been fatal for Tuppence's plans, since the badge in\nquestion was the device of a local training corps originated by the\narchdeacon in the early days of the war. Its presence in Tuppence's coat\nwas due to the fact that she had used it for pinning in some flowers a\nday or two before. But Tuppence had sharp eyes, and had noted the corner\nof a threepenny detective novel protruding from Albert's pocket, and the\nimmediate enlargement of his eyes told her that her tactics were good,\nand that the fish would rise to the bait.\n\n\"American Detective Force!\" she hissed.", "Albert fell for it.\n\n\"Lord!\" he murmured ecstatically.\n\nTuppence nodded at him with the air of one who has established a\nthorough understanding.\n\n\"Know who I'm after?\" she inquired genially.\n\nAlbert, still round-eyed, demanded breathlessly:\n\n\"One of the flats?\"\n\nTuppence nodded and jerked a thumb up the stairs.\n\n\"No. 20. Calls herself Vandemeyer. Vandemeyer! Ha! ha!\"\n\nAlbert's hand stole to his pocket.\n\n\"A crook?\" he queried eagerly.\n\n\"A crook? I should say so. Ready Rita they call her in the States.\"\n\n\"Ready Rita,\" repeated Albert deliriously. \"Oh, ain't it just like the\npictures!\"\n\nIt was. Tuppence was a great frequenter of the cinema.\n\n\"Annie always said as how she was a bad lot,\" continued the boy.\n\n\"Who's Annie?\" inquired Tuppence idly.\n\n\"'Ouse-parlourmaid. She's leaving to-day. Many's the time Annie's said\nto me: 'Mark my words, Albert, I wouldn't wonder if the police was to\ncome after her one of these days.' Just like that. But she's a stunner\nto look at, ain't she?\"\n\n\"She's some peach,\" allowed Tuppence carelessly. \"Finds it useful in her\nlay-out, you bet. Has she been wearing any of the emeralds, by the way?\"\n\n\"Emeralds? Them's the green stones, isn't they?\"\n\nTuppence nodded.\n\n\"That's what we're after her for. You know old man Rysdale?\"\n\nAlbert shook his head.\n\n\"Peter B. Rysdale, the oil king?\"\n\n\"It seems sort of familiar to me.\"\n\n\"The sparklers belonged to him. Finest collection of emeralds in the\nworld. Worth a million dollars!\"\n\n\"Lumme!\" came ecstatically from Albert. \"It sounds more like the\npictures every minute.\"\n\nTuppence smiled, gratified at the success of her efforts.\n\n\"We haven't exactly proved it yet. But we're after her. And\"--she\nproduced a long-drawn-out wink--\"I guess she won't get away with the\ngoods this time.\"\n\nAlbert uttered another ejaculation indicative of delight.\n\n\"Mind you, sonny, not a word of this,\" said Tuppence suddenly. \"I guess\nI oughtn't to have put you wise, but in the States we know a real smart\nlad when we see one.\"\n\n\"I'll not breathe a word,\" protested Albert eagerly. \"Ain't there\nanything I could do?", "A bit of shadowing, maybe, or such like?\"\n\nTuppence affected to consider, then shook her head.\n\n\"Not at the moment, but I'll bear you in mind, son. What's this about\nthe girl you say is leaving?\"\n\n\"Annie? Regular turn up, they 'ad. As Annie said, servants is some one\nnowadays, and to be treated accordingly, and, what with her passing the\nword round, she won't find it so easy to get another.\"\n\n\"Won't she?\" said Tuppence thoughtfully. \"I wonder----\"\n\nAn idea was dawning in her brain. She thought a minute or two, then\ntapped Albert on the shoulder.\n\n\"See here, son, my brain's got busy. How would it be if you mentioned\nthat you'd got a young cousin, or a friend of yours had, that might suit\nthe place. You get me?\"\n\n\"I'm there,\" said Albert instantly. \"You leave it to me, miss, and I'll\nfix the whole thing up in two ticks.\"\n\n\"Some lad!\" commented Tuppence, with a nod of approval. \"You might say\nthat the young woman could come in right away. You let me know, and if\nit's O.K. I'll be round to-morrow at eleven o'clock.\"\n\n\"Where am I to let you know to?\"\n\n\"_Ritz_,\" replied Tuppence laconically. \"Name of Cowley.\"\n\nAlbert eyed her enviously.\n\n\"It must be a good job, this tec business.\"\n\n\"It sure is,\" drawled Tuppence, \"especially when old man Rysdale backs\nthe bill. But don't fret, son. If this goes well, you shall come in on\nthe ground floor.\"\n\nWith which promise she took leave of her new ally, and walked briskly\naway from South Audley Mansions, well pleased with her morning's work.\n\nBut there was no time to be lost. She went straight back to the _Ritz_\nand wrote a few brief words to Mr. Carter. Having dispatched this, and\nTommy not having yet returned--which did not surprise her--she started\noff on a shopping expedition which, with an interval for tea and\nassorted creamy cakes, occupied her until well after six o'clock, and\nshe returned to the hotel jaded, but satisfied with her purchases.\nStarting with a cheap clothing store, and passing through one or two\nsecond-hand establishments, she had finished the day at a well-known\nhairdresser's.", "Now, in the seclusion of her bedroom, she unwrapped\nthat final purchase. Five minutes later she smiled contentedly at her\nreflection in the glass. With an actress's pencil she had slightly\naltered the line of her eyebrows, and that, taken in conjunction with\nthe new luxuriant growth of fair hair above, so changed her appearance\nthat she felt confident that even if she came face to face with\nWhittington he would not recognize her. She would wear elevators in her\nshoes, and the cap and apron would be an even more valuable disguise.\nFrom hospital experience she knew only too well that a nurse out of\nuniform is frequently unrecognized by her patients.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Tuppence aloud, nodding at the pert reflection in the glass,\n\"you'll do.\" She then resumed her normal appearance.\n\nDinner was a solitary meal. Tuppence was rather surprised at Tommy's\nnon-return. Julius, too, was absent--but that to the girl's mind was\nmore easily explained. His \"hustling\" activities were not confined\nto London, and his abrupt appearances and disappearances were fully\naccepted by the Young Adventurers as part of the day's work. It\nwas quite on the cards that Julius P. Hersheimmer had left for\nConstantinople at a moment's notice if he fancied that a clue to his\ncousin's disappearance was to be found there. The energetic young\nman had succeeded in making the lives of several Scotland Yard men\nunbearable to them, and the telephone girls at the Admiralty had learned\nto know and dread the familiar \"Hullo!\" He had spent three hours in\nParis hustling the Prefecture, and had returned from there imbued with\nthe idea, possibly inspired by a weary French official, that the true\nclue to the mystery was to be found in Ireland.\n\n\"I dare say he's dashed off there now,\" thought Tuppence. \"All very\nwell, but this is very dull for _me!_ Here I am bursting with news, and\nabsolutely no one to tell it to! Tommy might have wired, or something. I\nwonder where he is. Anyway, he can't have 'lost the trail' as they say.\nThat reminds me----\" And Miss Cowley broke off in her meditations, and\nsummoned a small boy.", "Ten minutes later the lady was ensconced comfortably on her bed,\nsmoking cigarettes and deep in the perusal of _Garnaby Williams, the Boy\nDetective_, which, with other threepenny works of lurid fiction, she had\nsent out to purchase. She felt, and rightly, that before the strain\nof attempting further intercourse with Albert, it would be as well to\nfortify herself with a good supply of local colour.\n\nThe morning brought a note from Mr. Carter:\n\n\"DEAR MISS TUPPENCE,\n\n\"You have made a splendid start, and I congratulate you. I feel, though,\nthat I should like to point out to you once more the risks you are\nrunning, especially if you pursue the course you indicate. Those people\nare absolutely desperate and incapable of either mercy or pity. I feel\nthat you probably underestimate the danger, and therefore warn you\nagain that I can promise you no protection. You have given us valuable\ninformation, and if you choose to withdraw now no one could blame you.\nAt any rate, think the matter over well before you decide.\n\n\"If, in spite of my warnings, you make up your mind to go through with\nit, you will find everything arranged. You have lived for two years with\nMiss Dufferin, The Parsonage, Llanelly, and Mrs. Vandemeyer can apply to\nher for a reference.\n\n\"May I be permitted a word or two of advice? Stick as near to the truth\nas possible--it minimizes the danger of 'slips.' I suggest that you\nshould represent yourself to be what you are, a former V.A.D., who has\nchosen domestic service as a profession. There are many such at the\npresent time. That explains away any incongruities of voice or manner\nwhich otherwise might awaken suspicion.\n\n\"Whichever way you decide, good luck to you.\n\n\"Your sincere friend,\n\n\"MR. CARTER.\"\n\nTuppence's spirits rose mercurially. Mr. Carter's warnings passed\nunheeded. The young lady had far too much confidence in herself to pay\nany heed to them.\n\nWith some reluctance she abandoned the interesting part she had sketched\nout for herself. Although she had no doubts of her own powers to sustain\na role indefinitely, she had too much common sense not to recognize the\nforce of Mr.", "Carter's arguments.\n\nThere was still no word or message from Tommy, but the morning post\nbrought a somewhat dirty postcard with the words: \"It's O.K.\" scrawled\nupon it.\n\nAt ten-thirty Tuppence surveyed with pride a slightly battered tin trunk\ncontaining her new possessions. It was artistically corded. It was with\na slight blush that she rang the bell and ordered it to be placed in a\ntaxi. She drove to Paddington, and left the box in the cloak room.\nShe then repaired with a handbag to the fastnesses of the ladies'\nwaiting-room. Ten minutes later a metamorphosed Tuppence walked demurely\nout of the station and entered a bus.\n\nIt was a few minutes past eleven when Tuppence again entered the hall\nof South Audley Mansions. Albert was on the look-out, attending to his\nduties in a somewhat desultory fashion. He did not immediately recognize\nTuppence. When he did, his admiration was unbounded.\n\n\"Blest if I'd have known you! That rig-out's top-hole.\"\n\n\"Glad you like it, Albert,\" replied Tuppence modestly. \"By the way, am I\nyour cousin, or am I not?\"\n\n\"Your voice too,\" cried the delighted boy. \"It's as English as anything!\nNo, I said as a friend of mine knew a young gal. Annie wasn't best\npleased. She's stopped on till to-day--to oblige, _she_ said, but really\nit's so as to put you against the place.\"\n\n\"Nice girl,\" said Tuppence.\n\nAlbert suspected no irony.\n\n\"She's style about her, and keeps her silver a treat--but, my word,\nain't she got a temper. Are you going up now, miss? Step inside the\nlift. No. 20 did you say?\" And he winked.\n\nTuppence quelled him with a stern glance, and stepped inside.\n\nAs she rang the bell of No. 20 she was conscious of Albert's eyes slowly\ndescending beneath the level of the floor.\n\nA smart young woman opened the door.\n\n\"I've come about the place,\" said Tuppence.\n\n\"It's a rotten place,\" said the young woman without hesitation. \"Regular\nold cat--always interfering. Accused me of tampering with her letters.\nMe! The flap was half undone anyway.", "There's never anything in the\nwaste-paper basket--she burns everything. She's a wrong 'un, that's what\nshe is. Swell clothes, but no class. Cook knows something about her--but\nshe won't tell--scared to death of her. And suspicious! She's on to you\nin a minute if you as much as speak to a fellow. I can tell you----\"\n\nBut what more Annie could tell, Tuppence was never destined to learn,\nfor at that moment a clear voice with a peculiarly steely ring to it\ncalled:\n\n\"Annie!\"\n\nThe smart young woman jumped as if she had been shot.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Who are you talking to?\"\n\n\"It's a young woman about the situation, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Show her in then. At once.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\nTuppence was ushered into a room on the right of the long passage. A\nwoman was standing by the fireplace. She was no longer in her first\nyouth, and the beauty she undeniably possessed was hardened and\ncoarsened. In her youth she must have been dazzling. Her pale gold hair,\nowing a slight assistance to art, was coiled low on her neck, her eyes,\nof a piercing electric blue, seemed to possess a faculty of boring into\nthe very soul of the person she was looking at. Her exquisite figure was\nenhanced by a wonderful gown of indigo charmeuse. And yet, despite her\nswaying grace, and the almost ethereal beauty of her face, you felt\ninstinctively the presence of something hard and menacing, a kind of\nmetallic strength that found expression in the tones of her voice and in\nthat gimlet-like quality of her eyes.\n\nFor the first time Tuppence felt afraid. She had not feared Whittington,\nbut this woman was different. As if fascinated, she watched the long\ncruel line of the red curving mouth, and again she felt that sensation\nof panic pass over her. Her usual self-confidence deserted her. Vaguely\nshe felt that deceiving this woman would be very different to deceiving\nWhittington. Mr. Carter's warning recurred to her mind. Here, indeed,\nshe might expect no mercy.\n\nFighting down that instinct of panic which urged her to turn tail and\nrun without further delay, Tuppence returned the lady's gaze firmly and\nrespectfully.", "As though that first scrutiny had been satisfactory, Mrs. Vandemeyer\nmotioned to a chair.\n\n\"You can sit down. How did you hear I wanted a house-parlourmaid?\"\n\n\"Through a friend who knows the lift boy here. He thought the place\nmight suit me.\"\n\nAgain that basilisk glance seemed to pierce her through.\n\n\"You speak like an educated girl?\"\n\nGlibly enough, Tuppence ran through her imaginary career on the lines\nsuggested by Mr. Carter. It seemed to her, as she did so, that the\ntension of Mrs. Vandemeyer's attitude relaxed.\n\n\"I see,\" she remarked at length. \"Is there anyone I can write to for a\nreference?\"\n\n\"I lived last with a Miss Dufferin, The Parsonage, Llanelly. I was with\nher two years.\"\n\n\"And then you thought you would get more money by coming to London,\nI suppose? Well, it doesn't matter to me. I will give you\nPS50--PS60--whatever you want. You can come in at once?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am. To-day, if you like. My box is at Paddington.\"\n\n\"Go and fetch it in a taxi, then. It's an easy place. I am out a good\ndeal. By the way, what's your name?\"\n\n\"Prudence Cooper, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Very well, Prudence. Go away and fetch your box. I shall be out to\nlunch. The cook will show you where everything is.\"\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am.\"\n\nTuppence withdrew. The smart Annie was not in evidence. In the hall\nbelow a magnificent hall porter had relegated Albert to the background.\nTuppence did not even glance at him as she passed meekly out.\n\nThe adventure had begun, but she felt less elated than she had done\nearlier in the morning. It crossed her mind that if the unknown Jane\nFinn had fallen into the hands of Mrs. Vandemeyer, it was likely to have\ngone hard with her.\n\nTUPPENCE betrayed no awkwardness in her new duties. The daughters of the\narchdeacon were well grounded in household tasks. They were also experts\nin training a \"raw girl,\" the inevitable result being that the raw girl,\nonce trained, departed elsewhere where her newly acquired knowledge\ncommanded a more substantial remuneration than the archdeacon's meagre\npurse allowed.", "Tuppence had therefore very little fear of proving inefficient. Mrs.\nVandemeyer's cook puzzled her. She evidently went in deadly terror of\nher mistress. The girl thought it probable that the other woman had some\nhold over her. For the rest, she cooked like a _chef_, as Tuppence had\nan opportunity of judging that evening. Mrs. Vandemeyer was expecting a\nguest to dinner, and Tuppence accordingly laid the beautifully polished\ntable for two. She was a little exercised in her own mind as to this\nvisitor. It was highly possible that it might prove to be Whittington.\nAlthough she felt fairly confident that he would not recognize her, yet\nshe would have been better pleased had the guest proved to be a total\nstranger. However, there was nothing for it but to hope for the best.\n\nAt a few minutes past eight the front door bell rang, and Tuppence went\nto answer it with some inward trepidation. She was relieved to see that\nthe visitor was the second of the two men whom Tommy had taken upon\nhimself to follow.\n\nHe gave his name as Count Stepanov. Tuppence announced him, and Mrs.\nVandemeyer rose from her seat on a low divan with a quick murmur of\npleasure.\n\n\"It is delightful to see you, Boris Ivanovitch,\" she said.\n\n\"And you, madame!\" He bowed low over her hand.\n\nTuppence returned to the kitchen.\n\n\"Count Stepanov, or some such,\" she remarked, and affecting a frank and\nunvarnished curiosity: \"Who's he?\"\n\n\"A Russian gentleman, I believe.\"\n\n\"Come here much?\"\n\n\"Once in a while. What d'you want to know for?\"\n\n\"Fancied he might be sweet on the missus, that's all,\" explained the\ngirl, adding with an appearance of sulkiness: \"How you do take one up!\"\n\n\"I'm not quite easy in my mind about the _souffle_,\" explained the\nother.\n\n\"You know something,\" thought Tuppence to herself, but aloud she only\nsaid: \"Going to dish up now? Right-o.\"\n\nWhilst waiting at table, Tuppence listened closely to all that was said.\nShe remembered that this was one of the men Tommy was shadowing when she\nhad last seen him.", "Already, although she would hardly admit it, she was\nbecoming uneasy about her partner. Where was he? Why had no word of any\nkind come from him? She had arranged before leaving the _Ritz_ to have\nall letters or messages sent on at once by special messenger to a small\nstationer's shop near at hand where Albert was to call in frequently.\nTrue, it was only yesterday morning that she had parted from Tommy, and\nshe told herself that any anxiety on his behalf would be absurd. Still,\nit was strange that he had sent no word of any kind.\n\nBut, listen as she might, the conversation presented no clue. Boris and\nMrs. Vandemeyer talked on purely indifferent subjects: plays they had\nseen, new dances, and the latest society gossip. After dinner they\nrepaired to the small boudoir where Mrs. Vandemeyer, stretched on the\ndivan, looked more wickedly beautiful than ever. Tuppence brought in the\ncoffee and liqueurs and unwillingly retired. As she did so, she heard\nBoris say:\n\n\"New, isn't she?\"\n\n\"She came in to-day. The other was a fiend. This girl seems all right.\nShe waits well.\"\n\nTuppence lingered a moment longer by the door which she had carefully\nneglected to close, and heard him say:\n\n\"Quite safe, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Really, Boris, you are absurdly suspicious. I believe she's the cousin\nof the hall porter, or something of the kind. And nobody even dreams\nthat I have any connection with our--mutual friend, Mr. Brown.\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake, be careful, Rita. That door isn't shut.\"\n\n\"Well, shut it then,\" laughed the woman.\n\nTuppence removed herself speedily.\n\nShe dared not absent herself longer from the back premises, but she\ncleared away and washed up with a breathless speed acquired in hospital.\nThen she slipped quietly back to the boudoir door. The cook, more\nleisurely, was still busy in the kitchen and, if she missed the other,\nwould only suppose her to be turning down the beds.\n\nAlas! The conversation inside was being carried on in too low a tone\nto permit of her hearing anything of it. She dared not reopen the\ndoor, however gently.", "Mrs. Vandemeyer was sitting almost facing it, and\nTuppence respected her mistress's lynx-eyed powers of observation.\n\nNevertheless, she felt she would give a good deal to overhear what was\ngoing on. Possibly, if anything unforeseen had happened, she might get\nnews of Tommy. For some moments she reflected desperately, then her\nface brightened. She went quickly along the passage to Mrs. Vandemeyer's\nbedroom, which had long French windows leading on to a balcony that ran\nthe length of the flat. Slipping quickly through the window, Tuppence\ncrept noiselessly along till she reached the boudoir window. As she\nhad thought it stood a little ajar, and the voices within were plainly\naudible.\n\nTuppence listened attentively, but there was no mention of anything\nthat could be twisted to apply to Tommy. Mrs. Vandemeyer and the Russian\nseemed to be at variance over some matter, and finally the latter\nexclaimed bitterly:\n\n\"With your persistent recklessness, you will end by ruining us!\"\n\n\"Bah!\" laughed the woman. \"Notoriety of the right kind is the best way\nof disarming suspicion. You will realize that one of these days--perhaps\nsooner than you think!\"\n\n\"In the meantime, you are going about everywhere with Peel Edgerton.\nNot only is he, perhaps, the most celebrated K.C. in England, but his\nspecial hobby is criminology! It is madness!\"\n\n\"I know that his eloquence has saved untold men from the gallows,\" said\nMrs. Vandemeyer calmly. \"What of it? I may need his assistance in that\nline myself some day. If so, how fortunate to have such a friend at\ncourt--or perhaps it would be more to the point to say _in_ court.\"\n\nBoris got up and began striding up and down. He was very excited.\n\n\"You are a clever woman, Rita; but you are also a fool! Be guided by me,\nand give up Peel Edgerton.\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer shook her head gently.\n\n\"I think not.\"\n\n\"You refuse?\" There was an ugly ring in the Russian's voice.\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Then, by Heaven,\" snarled the Russian, \"we will see----\"\n\nBut Mrs. Vandemeyer also rose to her feet, her eyes flashing.", "\"You forget, Boris,\" she said. \"I am accountable to no one. I take my\norders only from--Mr. Brown.\"\n\nThe other threw up his hands in despair.\n\n\"You are impossible,\" he muttered. \"Impossible! Already it may be too\nlate. They say Peel Edgerton can _smell_ a criminal! How do we know what\nis at the bottom of his sudden interest in you? Perhaps even now his\nsuspicions are aroused. He guesses----\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer eyed him scornfully.\n\n\"Reassure yourself, my dear Boris. He suspects nothing. With less than\nyour usual chivalry, you seem to forget that I am commonly accounted a\nbeautiful woman. I assure you that is all that interests Peel Edgerton.\"\n\nBoris shook his head doubtfully.\n\n\"He has studied crime as no other man in this kingdom has studied it. Do\nyou fancy that you can deceive him?\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer's eyes narrowed.\n\n\"If he is all that you say--it would amuse me to try!\"\n\n\"Good heavens, Rita----\"\n\n\"Besides,\" added Mrs. Vandemeyer, \"he is extremely rich. I am not one\nwho despises money. The 'sinews of war,' you know, Boris!\"\n\n\"Money--money! That is always the danger with you, Rita. I believe you\nwould sell your soul for money. I believe----\" He paused, then in a\nlow, sinister voice he said slowly: \"Sometimes I believe that you would\nsell-- _us!_\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer smiled and shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"The price, at any rate, would have to be enormous,\" she said lightly.\n\"It would be beyond the power of anyone but a millionaire to pay.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" snarled the Russian. \"You see, I was right!\"\n\n\"My dear Boris, can you not take a joke?\"\n\n\"Was it a joke?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Then all I can say is that your ideas of humour are peculiar, my dear\nRita.\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer smiled.\n\n\"Let us not quarrel, Boris. Touch the bell. We will have some drinks.\"\n\nTuppence beat a hasty retreat. She paused a moment to survey herself in\nMrs. Vandemeyer's long glass, and be sure that nothing was amiss with\nher appearance. Then she answered the bell demurely.\n\nThe conversation that she had overheard, although interesting in that\nit proved beyond doubt the complicity of both Rita and Boris, threw very\nlittle light on the present preoccupations.", "The name of Jane Finn had\nnot even been mentioned.\n\nThe following morning a few brief words with Albert informed her that\nnothing was waiting for her at the stationer's. It seemed incredible\nthat Tommy, if all was well with him, should not send any word to her.\nA cold hand seemed to close round her heart.... Supposing.... She choked\nher fears down bravely. It was no good worrying. But she leapt at a\nchance offered her by Mrs. Vandemeyer.\n\n\"What day do you usually go out, Prudence?\"\n\n\"Friday's my usual day, ma'am.\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer lifted her eyebrows.\n\n\"And to-day is Friday! But I suppose you hardly wish to go out to-day,\nas you only came yesterday.\"\n\n\"I was thinking of asking you if I might, ma'am.\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer looked at her a minute longer, and then smiled.\n\n\"I wish Count Stepanov could hear you. He made a suggestion about\nyou last night.\" Her smile broadened, catlike. \"Your request is\nvery--typical. I am satisfied. You do not understand all this--but\nyou can go out to-day. It makes no difference to me, as I shall not be\ndining at home.\"\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am.\"\n\nTuppence felt a sensation of relief once she was out of the other's\npresence. Once again she admitted to herself that she was afraid,\nhorribly afraid, of the beautiful woman with the cruel eyes.\n\nIn the midst of a final desultory polishing of her silver, Tuppence was\ndisturbed by the ringing of the front door bell, and went to answer it.\nThis time the visitor was neither Whittington nor Boris, but a man of\nstriking appearance.\n\nJust a shade over average height, he nevertheless conveyed the\nimpression of a big man. His face, clean-shaven and exquisitely mobile,\nwas stamped with an expression of power and force far beyond the\nordinary. Magnetism seemed to radiate from him.\n\nTuppence was undecided for the moment whether to put him down as an\nactor or a lawyer, but her doubts were soon solved as he gave her his\nname: Sir James Peel Edgerton.\n\nShe looked at him with renewed interest.", "This, then, was the famous K.C.\nwhose name was familiar all over England. She had heard it said that he\nmight one day be Prime Minister. He was known to have refused office in\nthe interests of his profession, preferring to remain a simple Member\nfor a Scotch constituency.\n\nTuppence went back to her pantry thoughtfully. The great man had\nimpressed her. She understood Boris's agitation. Peel Edgerton would not\nbe an easy man to deceive.\n\nIn about a quarter of an hour the bell rang, and Tuppence repaired to\nthe hall to show the visitor out. He had given her a piercing glance\nbefore. Now, as she handed him his hat and stick, she was conscious of\nhis eyes raking her through. As she opened the door and stood aside to\nlet him pass out, he stopped in the doorway.\n\n\"Not been doing this long, eh?\"\n\nTuppence raised her eyes, astonished. She read in his glance kindliness,\nand something else more difficult to fathom.\n\nHe nodded as though she had answered.\n\n\"V.A.D. and hard up, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Did Mrs. Vandemeyer tell you that?\" asked Tuppence suspiciously.\n\n\"No, child. The look of you told me. Good place here?\"\n\n\"Very good, thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"Ah, but there are plenty of good places nowadays. And a change does no\nharm sometimes.\"\n\n\"Do you mean----?\" began Tuppence.\n\nBut Sir James was already on the topmost stair. He looked back with his\nkindly, shrewd glance.\n\n\"Just a hint,\" he said. \"That's all.\"\n\nTuppence went back to the pantry more thoughtful than ever.\n\nDRESSED appropriately, Tuppence duly sallied forth for her \"afternoon\nout.\" Albert was in temporary abeyance, but Tuppence went herself to the\nstationer's to make quite sure that nothing had come for her. Satisfied\non this point, she made her way to the _Ritz_. On inquiry she learnt\nthat Tommy had not yet returned. It was the answer she had expected, but\nit was another nail in the coffin of her hopes. She resolved to appeal\nto Mr. Carter, telling him when and where Tommy had started on his\nquest, and asking him to do something to trace him.", "The prospect of\nhis aid revived her mercurial spirits, and she next inquired for Julius\nHersheimmer. The reply she got was to the effect that he had returned\nabout half an hour ago, but had gone out immediately.\n\nTuppence's spirits revived still more. It would be something to see\nJulius. Perhaps he could devise some plan for finding out what\nhad become of Tommy. She wrote her note to Mr. Carter in Julius's\nsitting-room, and was just addressing the envelope when the door burst\nopen.\n\n\"What the hell----\" began Julius, but checked himself abruptly. \"I beg\nyour pardon, Miss Tuppence. Those fools down at the office would have it\nthat Beresford wasn't here any longer--hadn't been here since Wednesday.\nIs that so?\"\n\nTuppence nodded.\n\n\"You don't know where he is?\" she asked faintly.\n\n\"I? How should I know? I haven't had one darned word from him, though I\nwired him yesterday morning.\"\n\n\"I expect your wire's at the office unopened.\"\n\n\"But where is he?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I hoped you might.\"\n\n\"I tell you I haven't had one darned word from him since we parted at\nthe depot on Wednesday.\"\n\n\"What depot?\"\n\n\"Waterloo. Your London and South Western road.\"\n\n\"Waterloo?\" frowned Tuppence.\n\n\"Why, yes. Didn't he tell you?\"\n\n\"I haven't seen him either,\" replied Tuppence impatiently. \"Go on about\nWaterloo. What were you doing there?\"\n\n\"He gave me a call. Over the phone. Told me to get a move on, and\nhustle. Said he was trailing two crooks.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence, her eyes opening. \"I see. Go on.\"\n\n\"I hurried along right away. Beresford was there. He pointed out the\ncrooks. The big one was mine, the guy you bluffed. Tommy shoved a ticket\ninto my hand and told me to get aboard the cars. He was going to sleuth\nthe other crook.\" Julius paused. \"I thought for sure you'd know all\nthis.\"\n\n\"Julius,\" said Tuppence firmly, \"stop walking up and down. It makes me\ngiddy. Sit down in that armchair, and tell me the whole story with as\nfew fancy turns of speech as possible.\"\n\nMr. Hersheimmer obeyed.", "\"Sure,\" he said. \"Where shall I begin?\"\n\n\"Where you left off. At Waterloo.\"\n\n\"Well,\" began Julius, \"I got into one of your dear old-fashioned\nfirst-class British compartments. The train was just off. First thing I\nknew a guard came along and informed me mighty politely that I wasn't\nin a smoking-carriage. I handed him out half a dollar, and that settled\nthat. I did a bit of prospecting along the corridor to the next coach.\nWhittington was there right enough. When I saw the skunk, with his big\nsleek fat face, and thought of poor little Jane in his clutches, I felt\nreal mad that I hadn't got a gun with me. I'd have tickled him up some.\n\n\"We got to Bournemouth all right. Whittington took a cab and gave the\nname of an hotel. I did likewise, and we drove up within three minutes\nof each other. He hired a room, and I hired one too. So far it was all\nplain sailing. He hadn't the remotest notion that anyone was on to him.\nWell, he just sat around in the hotel lounge, reading the papers and so\non, till it was time for dinner. He didn't hurry any over that either.\n\n\"I began to think that there was nothing doing, that he'd just come on\nthe trip for his health, but I remembered that he hadn't changed for\ndinner, though it was by way of being a slap-up hotel, so it seemed\nlikely enough that he'd be going out on his real business afterwards.\n\n\"Sure enough, about nine o'clock, so he did. Took a car across the\ntown--mighty pretty place by the way, I guess I'll take Jane there for\na spell when I find her--and then paid it off and struck out along those\npine-woods on the top of the cliff. I was there too, you understand.\nWe walked, maybe, for half an hour. There's a lot of villas all the way\nalong, but by degrees they seemed to get more and more thinned out, and\nin the end we got to one that seemed the last of the bunch.", "Big house it\nwas, with a lot of piny grounds around it.\n\n\"It was a pretty black night, and the carriage drive up to the house was\ndark as pitch. I could hear him ahead, though I couldn't see him. I\nhad to walk carefully in case he might get on to it that he was being\nfollowed. I turned a curve and I was just in time to see him ring the\nbell and get admitted to the house. I just stopped where I was. It was\nbeginning to rain, and I was soon pretty near soaked through. Also, it\nwas almighty cold.\n\n\"Whittington didn't come out again, and by and by I got kind of restive,\nand began to mouch around. All the ground floor windows were shuttered\ntight, but upstairs, on the first floor (it was a two-storied house) I\nnoticed a window with a light burning and the curtains not drawn.\n\n\"Now, just opposite to that window, there was a tree growing. It was\nabout thirty foot away from the house, maybe, and I sort of got it into\nmy head that, if I climbed up that tree, I'd very likely be able to see\ninto that room. Of course, I knew there was no reason why Whittington\nshould be in that room rather than in any other--less reason, in fact,\nfor the betting would be on his being in one of the reception-rooms\ndownstairs. But I guess I'd got the hump from standing so long in the\nrain, and anything seemed better than going on doing nothing. So I\nstarted up.\n\n\"It wasn't so easy, by a long chalk! The rain had made the boughs mighty\nslippery, and it was all I could do to keep a foothold, but bit by bit I\nmanaged it, until at last there I was level with the window.\n\n\"But then I was disappointed. I was too far to the left. I could only\nsee sideways into the room. A bit of curtain, and a yard of wallpaper\nwas all I could command. Well, that wasn't any manner of good to me, but\njust as I was going to give it up, and climb down ignominiously, some\none inside moved and threw his shadow on my little bit of wall--and, by\ngum, it was Whittington!", "\"After that, my blood was up. I'd just _got_ to get a look into that\nroom. It was up to me to figure out how. I noticed that there was a long\nbranch running out from the tree in the right direction. If I could only\nswarm about half-way along it, the proposition would be solved. But it\nwas mighty uncertain whether it would bear my weight. I decided I'd\njust got to risk that, and I started. Very cautiously, inch by inch, I\ncrawled along. The bough creaked and swayed in a nasty fashion, and it\ndidn't do to think of the drop below, but at last I got safely to where\nI wanted to be.\n\n\"The room was medium-sized, furnished in a kind of bare hygienic way.\nThere was a table with a lamp on it in the middle of the room, and\nsitting at that table, facing towards me, was Whittington right enough.\nHe was talking to a woman dressed as a hospital nurse. She was sitting\nwith her back to me, so I couldn't see her face. Although the blinds\nwere up, the window itself was shut, so I couldn't catch a word of what\nthey said. Whittington seemed to be doing all the talking, and the nurse\njust listened. Now and then she nodded, and sometimes she'd shake\nher head, as though she were answering questions. He seemed very\nemphatic--once or twice he beat with his fist on the table. The rain had\nstopped now, and the sky was clearing in that sudden way it does.\n\n\"Presently, he seemed to get to the end of what he was saying. He got\nup, and so did she. He looked towards the window and asked something--I\nguess it was whether it was raining. Anyway, she came right across and\nlooked out. Just then the moon came out from behind the clouds. I\nwas scared the woman would catch sight of me, for I was full in the\nmoonlight. I tried to move back a bit. The jerk I gave was too much for\nthat rotten old branch.", "With an almighty crash, down it came, and Julius\nP. Hersheimmer with it!\"\n\n\"Oh, Julius,\" breathed Tuppence, \"how exciting! Go on.\"\n\n\"Well, luckily for me, I pitched down into a good soft bed of earth--but\nit put me out of action for the time, sure enough. The next thing I\nknew, I was lying in bed with a hospital nurse (not Whittington's one)\non one side of me, and a little black-bearded man with gold glasses,\nand medical man written all over him, on the other. He rubbed his hands\ntogether, and raised his eyebrows as I stared at him. 'Ah!' he said. 'So\nour young friend is coming round again. Capital. Capital.'\n\n\"I did the usual stunt. Said: 'What's happened?' And 'Where am I?' But\nI knew the answer to the last well enough. There's no moss growing on\nmy brain. 'I think that'll do for the present, sister,' said the little\nman, and the nurse left the room in a sort of brisk well-trained way.\nBut I caught her handing me out a look of deep curiosity as she passed\nthrough the door.\n\n\"That look of hers gave me an idea. 'Now then, doc,' I said, and tried\nto sit up in bed, but my right foot gave me a nasty twinge as I did so.\n'A slight sprain,' explained the doctor. 'Nothing serious. You'll be\nabout again in a couple of days.'\"\n\n\"I noticed you walked lame,\" interpolated Tuppence.\n\nJulius nodded, and continued:\n\n\"'How did it happen?' I asked again. He replied dryly. 'You fell, with\na considerable portion of one of my trees, into one of my newly planted\nflower-beds.'\n\n\"I liked the man. He seemed to have a sense of humour. I felt sure that\nhe, at least, was plumb straight. 'Sure, doc,' I said, 'I'm sorry about\nthe tree, and I guess the new bulbs will be on me. But perhaps you'd\nlike to know what I was doing in your garden?' 'I think the facts do\ncall for an explanation,' he replied. 'Well, to begin with, I wasn't\nafter the spoons.'", "\"He smiled. 'My first theory. But I soon altered my mind. By the way,\nyou are an American, are you not?' I told him my name. 'And you?' 'I am\nDr. Hall, and this, as you doubtless know, is my private nursing home.'\n\n\"I didn't know, but I wasn't going to put him wise. I was just thankful\nfor the information. I liked the man, and I felt he was straight, but\nI wasn't going to give him the whole story. For one thing he probably\nwouldn't have believed it.\n\n\"I made up my mind in a flash. 'Why, doctor,' I said, 'I guess I feel\nan almighty fool, but I owe it to you to let you know that it wasn't\nthe Bill Sikes business I was up to.' Then I went on and mumbled out\nsomething about a girl. I trotted out the stern guardian business, and a\nnervous breakdown, and finally explained that I had fancied I recognized\nher among the patients at the home, hence my nocturnal adventures. I\nguess it was just the kind of story he was expecting. 'Quite a romance,'\nhe said genially, when I'd finished. 'Now, doc,' I went on, 'will you\nbe frank with me? Have you here now, or have you had here at any time,\na young girl called Jane Finn?' He repeated the name thoughtfully. 'Jane\nFinn?' he said. 'No.'\n\n\"I was chagrined, and I guess I showed it. 'You are sure?' 'Quite sure,\nMr. Hersheimmer. It is an uncommon name, and I should not have been\nlikely to forget it.'\n\n\"Well, that was flat. It laid me out for a space. I'd kind of hoped\nmy search was at an end. 'That's that,' I said at last. 'Now, there's\nanother matter. When I was hugging that darned branch I thought I\nrecognized an old friend of mine talking to one of your nurses.' I\npurposely didn't mention any name because, of course, Whittington might\nbe calling himself something quite different down here, but the doctor\nanswered at once. 'Mr. Whittington, perhaps?' 'That's the fellow,' I\nreplied.", "'What's he doing down here? Don't tell me _his_ nerves are out\nof order?'\n\n\"Dr. Hall laughed. 'No. He came down to see one of my nurses, Nurse\nEdith, who is a niece of his.' 'Why, fancy that!' I exclaimed. 'Is he\nstill here?' 'No, he went back to town almost immediately.' 'What a\npity!' I ejaculated. 'But perhaps I could speak to his niece--Nurse\nEdith, did you say her name was?'\n\n\"But the doctor shook his head. 'I'm afraid that, too, is impossible.\nNurse Edith left with a patient to-night also.' 'I seem to be real\nunlucky,' I remarked. 'Have you Mr. Whittington's address in town?\nI guess I'd like to look him up when I get back.' 'I don't know his\naddress. I can write to Nurse Edith for it if you like.' I thanked him.\n'Don't say who it is wants it. I'd like to give him a little surprise.'\n\n\"That was about all I could do for the moment. Of course, if the girl\nwas really Whittington's niece, she might be too cute to fall into the\ntrap, but it was worth trying. Next thing I did was to write out a wire\nto Beresford saying where I was, and that I was laid up with a sprained\nfoot, and telling him to come down if he wasn't busy. I had to be\nguarded in what I said. However, I didn't hear from him, and my foot\nsoon got all right. It was only ricked, not really sprained, so to-day I\nsaid good-bye to the little doctor chap, asked him to send me word if\nhe heard from Nurse Edith, and came right away back to town. Say, Miss\nTuppence, you're looking mighty pale!\"\n\n\"It's Tommy,\" said Tuppence. \"What can have happened to him?\"\n\n\"Buck up, I guess he's all right really. Why shouldn't he be? See here,\nit was a foreign-looking guy he went off after. Maybe they've gone\nabroad--to Poland, or something like that?\"\n\nTuppence shook her head.\n\n\"He couldn't without passports and things. Besides I've seen that man,\nBoris Something, since.", "He dined with Mrs. Vandemeyer last night.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Who?\"\n\n\"I forgot. Of course you don't know all that.\"\n\n\"I'm listening,\" said Julius, and gave vent to his favourite expression.\n\"Put me wise.\"\n\nTuppence thereupon related the events of the last two days. Julius's\nastonishment and admiration were unbounded.\n\n\"Bully for you! Fancy you a menial. It just tickles me to death!\" Then\nhe added seriously: \"But say now, I don't like it, Miss Tuppence, I sure\ndon't. You're just as plucky as they make 'em, but I wish you'd keep\nright out of this. These crooks we're up against would as soon croak a\ngirl as a man any day.\"\n\n\"Do you think I'm afraid?\" said Tuppence indignantly, valiantly\nrepressing memories of the steely glitter in Mrs. Vandemeyer's eyes.\n\n\"I said before you were darned plucky. But that doesn't alter facts.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother _me!_\" said Tuppence impatiently. \"Let's think about what\ncan have happened to Tommy. I've written to Mr. Carter about it,\" she\nadded, and told him the gist of her letter.\n\nJulius nodded gravely.\n\n\"I guess that's good as far as it goes. But it's for us to get busy and\ndo something.\"\n\n\"What can we do?\" asked Tuppence, her spirits rising.\n\n\"I guess we'd better get on the track of Boris. You say he's been to\nyour place. Is he likely to come again?\"\n\n\"He might. I really don't know.\"\n\n\"I see. Well, I guess I'd better buy a car, a slap-up one, dress as a\nchauffeur and hang about outside. Then if Boris comes, you could make\nsome kind of signal, and I'd trail him. How's that?\"\n\n\"Splendid, but he mightn't come for weeks.\"\n\n\"We'll have to chance that. I'm glad you like the plan.\" He rose.\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"To buy the car, of course,\" replied Julius, surprised. \"What make do\nyou like? I guess you'll do some riding in it before we've finished.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Tuppence faintly, \"I _like_ Rolls-Royces, but----\"\n\n\"Sure,\" agreed Julius. \"What you say goes. I'll get one.\"\n\n\"But you can't at once,\" cried Tuppence. \"People wait ages sometimes.\"", "\"Little Julius doesn't,\" affirmed Mr. Hersheimmer. \"Don't you worry any.\nI'll be round in the car in half an hour.\"\n\nTuppence got up.\n\n\"You're awfully good, Julius. But I can't help feeling that it's rather\na forlorn hope. I'm really pinning my faith to Mr. Carter.\"\n\n\"Then I shouldn't.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Just an idea of mine.\"\n\n\"Oh; but he must do something. There's no one else. By the way, I forgot\nto tell you of a queer thing that happened this morning.\"\n\nAnd she narrated her encounter with Sir James Peel Edgerton. Julius was\ninterested.\n\n\"What did the guy mean, do you think?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't quite know,\" said Tuppence meditatively. \"But I think that, in\nan ambiguous, legal, without prejudishish lawyer's way, he was trying to\nwarn me.\"\n\n\"Why should he?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" confessed Tuppence. \"But he looked kind, and\nsimply awfully clever. I wouldn't mind going to him and telling him\neverything.\"\n\nSomewhat to her surprise, Julius negatived the idea sharply.\n\n\"See here,\" he said, \"we don't want any lawyers mixed up in this. That\nguy couldn't help us any.\"\n\n\"Well, I believe he could,\" reiterated Tuppence obstinately.\n\n\"Don't you think it. So long. I'll be back in half an hour.\"\n\nThirty-five minutes had elapsed when Julius returned. He took Tuppence\nby the arm, and walked her to the window.\n\n\"There she is.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence with a note of reverence in her voice, as she gazed\ndown at the enormous car.\n\n\"She's some pace-maker, I can tell you,\" said Julius complacently.\n\n\"How did you get it?\" gasped Tuppence.\n\n\"She was just being sent home to some bigwig.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I went round to his house,\" said Julius. \"I said that I reckoned a car\nlike that was worth every penny of twenty thousand dollars. Then I told\nhim that it was worth just about fifty thousand dollars to me if he'd\nget out.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Tuppence, intoxicated.\n\n\"Well,\" returned Julius, \"he got out, that's all.\"\n\nFRIDAY and Saturday passed uneventfully. Tuppence had received a brief\nanswer to her appeal from Mr. Carter. In it he pointed out that the\nYoung Adventurers had undertaken the work at their own risk, and had\nbeen fully warned of the dangers.", "If anything had happened to Tommy he\nregretted it deeply, but he could do nothing.\n\nThis was cold comfort. Somehow, without Tommy, all the savour went out\nof the adventure, and, for the first time, Tuppence felt doubtful of\nsuccess. While they had been together she had never questioned it for\na minute. Although she was accustomed to take the lead, and to pride\nherself on her quick-wittedness, in reality she had relied upon Tommy\nmore than she realized at the time. There was something so eminently\nsober and clear-headed about him, his common sense and soundness of\nvision were so unvarying, that without him Tuppence felt much like a\nrudderless ship. It was curious that Julius, who was undoubtedly much\ncleverer than Tommy, did not give her the same feeling of support. She\nhad accused Tommy of being a pessimist, and it is certain that he\nalways saw the disadvantages and difficulties which she herself was\noptimistically given to overlooking, but nevertheless she had really\nrelied a good deal on his judgment. He might be slow, but he was very\nsure.\n\nIt seemed to the girl that, for the first time, she realized the\nsinister character of the mission they had undertaken so lightheartedly.\nIt had begun like a page of romance. Now, shorn of its glamour, it\nseemed to be turning to grim reality. Tommy--that was all that mattered.\nMany times in the day Tuppence blinked the tears out of her eyes\nresolutely. \"Little fool,\" she would apostrophize herself, \"don't\nsnivel. Of course you're fond of him. You've known him all your life.\nBut there's no need to be sentimental about it.\"\n\nIn the meantime, nothing more was seen of Boris. He did not come to the\nflat, and Julius and the car waited in vain. Tuppence gave herself over\nto new meditations. Whilst admitting the truth of Julius's objections,\nshe had nevertheless not entirely relinquished the idea of appealing to\nSir James Peel Edgerton. Indeed, she had gone so far as to look up his\naddress in the _Red Book_. Had he meant to warn her that day?", "If so,\nwhy? Surely she was at least entitled to demand an explanation. He had\nlooked at her so kindly. Perhaps he might tell them something concerning\nMrs. Vandemeyer which might lead to a clue to Tommy's whereabouts.\n\nAnyway, Tuppence decided, with her usual shake of the shoulders, it was\nworth trying, and try it she would. Sunday was her afternoon out. She\nwould meet Julius, persuade him to her point of view, and they would\nbeard the lion in his den.\n\nWhen the day arrived Julius needed a considerable amount of persuading,\nbut Tuppence held firm. \"It can do no harm,\" was what she always came\nback to. In the end Julius gave in, and they proceeded in the car to\nCarlton House Terrace.\n\nThe door was opened by an irreproachable butler. Tuppence felt a little\nnervous. After all, perhaps it _was_ colossal cheek on her part. She\nhad decided not to ask if Sir James was \"at home,\" but to adopt a more\npersonal attitude.\n\n\"Will you ask Sir James if I can see him for a few minutes? I have an\nimportant message for him.\"\n\nThe butler retired, returning a moment or two later.\n\n\"Sir James will see you. Will you step this way?\"\n\nHe ushered them into a room at the back of the house, furnished as a\nlibrary. The collection of books was a magnificent one, and Tuppence\nnoticed that all one wall was devoted to works on crime and criminology.\nThere were several deep-padded leather arm-chairs, and an old-fashioned\nopen hearth. In the window was a big roll-top desk strewn with papers at\nwhich the master of the house was sitting.\n\nHe rose as they entered.\n\n\"You have a message for me? Ah\"--he recognized Tuppence with a\nsmile--\"it's you, is it? Brought a message from Mrs. Vandemeyer, I\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" said Tuppence. \"In fact, I'm afraid I only said that to\nbe quite sure of getting in. Oh, by the way, this is Mr. Hersheimmer,\nSir James Peel Edgerton.\"\n\n\"Pleased to meet you,\" said the American, shooting out a hand.", "\"Won't you both sit down?\" asked Sir James. He drew forward two chairs.\n\n\"Sir James,\" said Tuppence, plunging boldly, \"I dare say you will think\nit is most awful cheek of me coming here like this. Because, of course,\nit's nothing whatever to do with you, and then you're a very important\nperson, and of course Tommy and I are very unimportant.\" She paused for\nbreath.\n\n\"Tommy?\" queried Sir James, looking across at the American.\n\n\"No, that's Julius,\" explained Tuppence. \"I'm rather nervous, and that\nmakes me tell it badly. What I really want to know is what you meant by\nwhat you said to me the other day? Did you mean to warn me against Mrs.\nVandemeyer? You did, didn't you?\"\n\n\"My dear young lady, as far as I recollect I only mentioned that there\nwere equally good situations to be obtained elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know. But it was a hint, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps it was,\" admitted Sir James gravely.\n\n\"Well, I want to know more. I want to know just _why_ you gave me a\nhint.\"\n\nSir James smiled at her earnestness.\n\n\"Suppose the lady brings a libel action against me for defamation of\ncharacter?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Tuppence. \"I know lawyers are always dreadfully\ncareful. But can't we say 'without prejudice' first, and then say just\nwhat we want to.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Sir James, still smiling, \"without prejudice, then, if I\nhad a young sister forced to earn her living, I should not like to see\nher in Mrs. Vandemeyer's service. I felt it incumbent on me just to give\nyou a hint. It is no place for a young and inexperienced girl. That is\nall I can tell you.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Tuppence thoughtfully. \"Thank you very much. But I'm not\n_really_ inexperienced, you know. I knew perfectly that she was a bad\nlot when I went there--as a matter of fact that's _why_ I went----\" She\nbroke off, seeing some bewilderment on the lawyer's face, and went on:\n\"I think perhaps I'd better tell you the whole story, Sir James. I've a\nsort of feeling that you'd know in a minute if I didn't tell the truth,\nand so you might as well know all about it from the beginning.", "What do\nyou think, Julius?\"\n\n\"As you're bent on it, I'd go right ahead with the facts,\" replied the\nAmerican, who had so far sat in silence.\n\n\"Yes, tell me all about it,\" said Sir James. \"I want to know who Tommy\nis.\"\n\nThus encouraged Tuppence plunged into her tale, and the lawyer listened\nwith close attention.\n\n\"Very interesting,\" he said, when she finished. \"A great deal of what\nyou tell me, child, is already known to me. I've had certain theories\nof my own about this Jane Finn. You've done extraordinarily well so\nfar, but it's rather too bad of--what do you know him as?--Mr. Carter to\npitchfork you two young things into an affair of this kind. By the\nway, where did Mr. Hersheimmer come in originally? You didn't make that\nclear?\"\n\nJulius answered for himself.\n\n\"I'm Jane's first cousin,\" he explained, returning the lawyer's keen\ngaze.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"Oh, Sir James,\" broke out Tuppence, \"what do you think has become of\nTommy?\"\n\n\"H'm.\" The lawyer rose, and paced slowly up and down. \"When you arrived,\nyoung lady, I was just packing up my traps. Going to Scotland by the\nnight train for a few days' fishing. But there are different kinds of\nfishing. I've a good mind to stay, and see if we can't get on the track\nof that young chap.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Tuppence clasped her hands ecstatically.\n\n\"All the same, as I said before, it's too bad of--of Carter to set you\ntwo babies on a job like this. Now, don't get offended, Miss--er----\"\n\n\"Cowley. Prudence Cowley. But my friends call me Tuppence.\"\n\n\"Well, Miss Tuppence, then, as I'm certainly going to be a friend. Don't\nbe offended because I think you're young. Youth is a failing only too\neasily outgrown. Now, about this young Tommy of yours----\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Tuppence clasped her hands.\n\n\"Frankly, things look bad for him. He's been butting in somewhere where\nhe wasn't wanted. Not a doubt of it. But don't give up hope.\"\n\n\"And you really will help us? There, Julius! He didn't want me to come,\"\n she added by way of explanation.", "\"H'm,\" said the lawyer, favouring Julius with another keen glance. \"And\nwhy was that?\"\n\n\"I reckoned it would be no good worrying you with a petty little\nbusiness like this.\"\n\n\"I see.\" He paused a moment. \"This petty little business, as you call\nit, bears directly on a very big business, bigger perhaps than either\nyou or Miss Tuppence know. If this boy is alive, he may have very\nvaluable information to give us. Therefore, we must find him.\"\n\n\"Yes, but how?\" cried Tuppence. \"I've tried to think of everything.\"\n\nSir James smiled.\n\n\"And yet there's one person quite near at hand who in all probability\nknows where he is, or at all events where he is likely to be.\"\n\n\"Who is that?\" asked Tuppence, puzzled.\n\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer.\"\n\n\"Yes, but she'd never tell us.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is where I come in. I think it quite likely that I shall be\nable to make Mrs. Vandemeyer tell me what I want to know.\"\n\n\"How?\" demanded Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide.\n\n\"Oh, just by asking her questions,\" replied Sir James easily. \"That's\nthe way we do it, you know.\"\n\nHe tapped with his finger on the table, and Tuppence felt again the\nintense power that radiated from the man.\n\n\"And if she won't tell?\" asked Julius suddenly.\n\n\"I think she will. I have one or two powerful levers. Still, in that\nunlikely event, there is always the possibility of bribery.\"\n\n\"Sure. And that's where I come in!\" cried Julius, bringing his fist down\non the table with a bang. \"You can count on me, if necessary, for one\nmillion dollars. Yes, sir, one million dollars!\"\n\nSir James sat down and subjected Julius to a long scrutiny.\n\n\"Mr. Hersheimmer,\" he said at last, \"that is a very large sum.\"\n\n\"I guess it'll have to be. These aren't the kind of folk to offer\nsixpence to.\"\n\n\"At the present rate of exchange it amounts to considerably over two\nhundred and fifty thousand pounds.\"\n\n\"That's so. Maybe you think I'm talking through my hat, but I can\ndeliver the goods all right, with enough over to spare for your fee.\"", "Sir James flushed slightly.\n\n\"There is no question of a fee, Mr. Hersheimmer. I am not a private\ndetective.\"\n\n\"Sorry. I guess I was just a mite hasty, but I've been feeling bad about\nthis money question. I wanted to offer a big reward for news of Jane\nsome days ago, but your crusted institution of Scotland Yard advised me\nagainst it. Said it was undesirable.\"\n\n\"They were probably right,\" said Sir James dryly.\n\n\"But it's all O.K. about Julius,\" put in Tuppence. \"He's not pulling\nyour leg. He's got simply pots of money.\"\n\n\"The old man piled it up in style,\" explained Julius. \"Now, let's get\ndown to it. What's your idea?\"\n\nSir James considered for a moment or two.\n\n\"There is no time to be lost. The sooner we strike the better.\" He\nturned to Tuppence. \"Is Mrs. Vandemeyer dining out to-night, do you\nknow?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so, but she will not be out late. Otherwise, she would\nhave taken the latchkey.\"\n\n\"Good. I will call upon her about ten o'clock. What time are you\nsupposed to return?\"\n\n\"About nine-thirty or ten, but I could go back earlier.\"\n\n\"You must not do that on any account. It might arouse suspicion if you\ndid not stay out till the usual time. Be back by nine-thirty. I will\narrive at ten. Mr. Hersheimmer will wait below in a taxi perhaps.\"\n\n\"He's got a new Rolls-Royce car,\" said Tuppence with vicarious pride.\n\n\"Even better. If I succeed in obtaining the address from her, we can\ngo there at once, taking Mrs. Vandemeyer with us if necessary. You\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Tuppence rose to her feet with a skip of delight. \"Oh, I feel so\nmuch better!\"\n\n\"Don't build on it too much, Miss Tuppence. Go easy.\"\n\nJulius turned to the lawyer.\n\n\"Say, then. I'll call for you in the car round about nine-thirty. Is\nthat right?\"\n\n\"Perhaps that will be the best plan. It would be unnecessary to have two\ncars waiting about. Now, Miss Tuppence, my advice to you is to go and\nhave a good dinner, a _really_ good one, mind.", "And don't think ahead\nmore than you can help.\"\n\nHe shook hands with them both, and a moment later they were outside.\n\n\"Isn't he a duck?\" inquired Tuppence ecstatically, as she skipped down\nthe steps. \"Oh, Julius, isn't he just a duck?\"\n\n\"Well, I allow he seems to be the goods all right. And I was wrong about\nits being useless to go to him. Say, shall we go right away back to the\n_Ritz?_\"\n\n\"I must walk a bit, I think. I feel so excited. Drop me in the park,\nwill you? Unless you'd like to come too?\"\n\n\"I want to get some petrol,\" he explained. \"And send off a cable or\ntwo.\"\n\n\"All right. I'll meet you at the _Ritz_ at seven. We'll have to dine\nupstairs. I can't show myself in these glad rags.\"\n\n\"Sure. I'll get Felix help me choose the menu. He's some head waiter,\nthat. So long.\"\n\nTuppence walked briskly along towards the Serpentine, first glancing at\nher watch. It was nearly six o'clock. She remembered that she had had no\ntea, but felt too excited to be conscious of hunger. She walked as\nfar as Kensington Gardens and then slowly retraced her steps, feeling\ninfinitely better for the fresh air and exercise. It was not so easy to\nfollow Sir James's advice, and put the possible events of the evening\nout of her head. As she drew nearer and nearer to Hyde Park corner, the\ntemptation to return to South Audley Mansions was almost irresistible.\n\nAt any rate, she decided, it would do no harm just to go and _look_\nat the building. Perhaps, then, she could resign herself to waiting\npatiently for ten o'clock.\n\nSouth Audley Mansions looked exactly the same as usual. What Tuppence\nhad expected she hardly knew, but the sight of its red brick stolidity\nslightly assuaged the growing and entirely unreasonable uneasiness\nthat possessed her. She was just turning away when she heard a piercing\nwhistle, and the faithful Albert came running from the building to join\nher.\n\nTuppence frowned. It was no part of the programme to have attention\ncalled to her presence in the neighbourhood, but Albert was purple with\nsuppressed excitement.", "\"I say, miss, she's a-going!\"\n\n\"Who's going?\" demanded Tuppence sharply.\n\n\"The crook. Ready Rita. Mrs. Vandemeyer. She's a-packing up, and she's\njust sent down word for me to get her a taxi.\"\n\n\"What?\" Tuppence clutched his arm.\n\n\"It's the truth, miss. I thought maybe as you didn't know about it.\"\n\n\"Albert,\" cried Tuppence, \"you're a brick. If it hadn't been for you\nwe'd have lost her.\"\n\nAlbert flushed with pleasure at this tribute.\n\n\"There's no time to lose,\" said Tuppence, crossing the road. \"I've got\nto stop her. At all costs I must keep her here until----\" She broke off.\n\"Albert, there's a telephone here, isn't there?\"\n\nThe boy shook his head.\n\n\"The flats mostly have their own, miss. But there's a box just round the\ncorner.\"\n\n\"Go to it then, at once, and ring up the _Ritz Hotel_. Ask for Mr.\nHersheimmer, and when you get him tell him to get Sir James and come on\nat once, as Mrs. Vandemeyer is trying to hook it. If you can't get him,\nring up Sir James Peel Edgerton, you'll find his number in the book, and\ntell him what's happening. You won't forget the names, will you?\"\n\nAlbert repeated them glibly. \"You trust to me, miss, it'll be all right.\nBut what about you? Aren't you afraid to trust yourself with her?\"\n\n\"No, no, that's all right. _But go and telephone_. Be quick.\"\n\nDrawing a long breath, Tuppence entered the Mansions and ran up to the\ndoor of No. 20. How she was to detain Mrs. Vandemeyer until the two men\narrived, she did not know, but somehow or other it had to be done, and\nshe must accomplish the task single-handed. What had occasioned this\nprecipitate departure? Did Mrs. Vandemeyer suspect her?\n\nSpeculations were idle. Tuppence pressed the bell firmly. She might\nlearn something from the cook.\n\nNothing happened and, after waiting some minutes, Tuppence pressed the\nbell again, keeping her finger on the button for some little while.\nAt last she heard footsteps inside, and a moment later Mrs. Vandemeyer\nherself opened the door. She lifted her eyebrows at the sight of the\ngirl.", "\"You?\"\n\n\"I had a touch of toothache, ma'am,\" said Tuppence glibly. \"So thought\nit better to come home and have a quiet evening.\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer said nothing, but she drew back and let Tuppence pass\ninto the hall.\n\n\"How unfortunate for you,\" she said coldly. \"You had better go to bed.\"\n\n\"Oh, I shall be all right in the kitchen, ma'am. Cook will----\"\n\n\"Cook is out,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer, in a rather disagreeable tone. \"I\nsent her out. So you see you had better go to bed.\"\n\nSuddenly Tuppence felt afraid. There was a ring in Mrs. Vandemeyer's\nvoice that she did not like at all. Also, the other woman was slowly\nedging her up the passage. Tuppence turned at bay.\n\n\"I don't want----\"\n\nThen, in a flash, a rim of cold steel touched her temple, and Mrs.\nVandemeyer's voice rose cold and menacing:\n\n\"You damned little fool! Do you think I don't know? No, don't answer. If\nyou struggle or cry out, I'll shoot you like a dog.\"\n\nThe rim of steel pressed a little harder against the girl's temple.\n\n\"Now then, march,\" went on Mrs. Vandemeyer. \"This way--into my room. In\na minute, when I've done with you, you'll go to bed as I told you to.\nAnd you'll sleep--oh yes, my little spy, you'll sleep all right!\"\n\nThere was a sort of hideous geniality in the last words which Tuppence\ndid not at all like. For the moment there was nothing to be done, and\nshe walked obediently into Mrs. Vandemeyer's bedroom. The pistol never\nleft her forehead. The room was in a state of wild disorder, clothes\nwere flung about right and left, a suit-case and a hat box, half-packed,\nstood in the middle of the floor.\n\nTuppence pulled herself together with an effort. Her voice shook a\nlittle, but she spoke out bravely.\n\n\"Come now,\" she said. \"This is nonsense. You can't shoot me. Why, every\none in the building would hear the report.\"\n\n\"I'd risk that,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer cheerfully. \"But, as long as you\ndon't sing out for help, you're all right--and I don't think you will.", "You're a clever girl. You deceived _me_ all right. I hadn't a suspicion\nof you! So I've no doubt that you understand perfectly well that this\nis where I'm on top and you're underneath. Now then--sit on the bed. Put\nyour hands above your head, and if you value your life don't move them.\"\n\nTuppence obeyed passively. Her good sense told her that there was\nnothing else to do but accept the situation. If she shrieked for help\nthere was very little chance of anyone hearing her, whereas there was\nprobably quite a good chance of Mrs. Vandemeyer's shooting her. In the\nmeantime, every minute of delay gained was valuable.\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer laid down the revolver on the edge of the washstand\nwithin reach of her hand, and, still eyeing Tuppence like a lynx in case\nthe girl should attempt to move, she took a little stoppered bottle from\nits place on the marble and poured some of its contents into a glass\nwhich she filled up with water.\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Tuppence sharply.\n\n\"Something to make you sleep soundly.\"\n\nTuppence paled a little.\n\n\"Are you going to poison me?\" she asked in a whisper.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer, smiling agreeably.\n\n\"Then I shan't drink it,\" said Tuppence firmly. \"I'd much rather be\nshot. At any rate that would make a row, and some one might hear it. But\nI won't be killed off quietly like a lamb.\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer stamped her foot.\n\n\"Don't be a little fool! Do you really think I want a hue and cry for\nmurder out after me? If you've any sense at all, you'll realize that\npoisoning you wouldn't suit my book at all. It's a sleeping draught,\nthat's all. You'll wake up to-morrow morning none the worse. I simply\ndon't want the bother of tying you up and gagging you. That's the\nalternative--and you won't like it, I can tell you! I can be very rough\nif I choose. So drink this down like a good girl, and you'll be none the\nworse for it.\"\n\nIn her heart of hearts Tuppence believed her.", "The arguments she had\nadduced rang true. It was a simple and effective method of getting her\nout of the way for the time being. Nevertheless, the girl did not take\nkindly to the idea of being tamely put to sleep without as much as one\nbid for freedom. She felt that once Mrs. Vandemeyer gave them the slip,\nthe last hope of finding Tommy would be gone.\n\nTuppence was quick in her mental processes. All these reflections\npassed through her mind in a flash, and she saw where a chance, a very\nproblematical chance, lay, and she determined to risk all in one supreme\neffort.\n\nAccordingly, she lurched suddenly off the bed and fell on her knees\nbefore Mrs. Vandemeyer, clutching her skirts frantically.\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" she moaned. \"It's poison--I know it's poison.\nOh, don't make me drink it\"--her voice rose to a shriek--\"don't make me\ndrink it!\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer, glass in hand, looked down with a curling lip at this\nsudden collapse.\n\n\"Get up, you little idiot! Don't go on drivelling there. How you ever\nhad the nerve to play your part as you did I can't think.\" She stamped\nher foot. \"Get up, I say.\"\n\nBut Tuppence continued to cling and sob, interjecting her sobs with\nincoherent appeals for mercy. Every minute gained was to the good.\nMoreover, as she grovelled, she moved imperceptibly nearer to her\nobjective.\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer gave a sharp impatient exclamation, and jerked the girl\nto her knees.\n\n\"Drink it at once!\" Imperiously she pressed the glass to the girl's\nlips.\n\nTuppence gave one last despairing moan.\n\n\"You swear it won't hurt me?\" she temporized.\n\n\"Of course it won't hurt you. Don't be a fool.\"\n\n\"Will you swear it?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the other impatiently. \"I swear it.\"\n\nTuppence raised a trembling left hand to the glass.\n\n\"Very well.\" Her mouth opened meekly.\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer gave a sigh of relief, off her guard for the moment.\nThen, quick as a flash, Tuppence jerked the glass upward as hard as she\ncould. The fluid in it splashed into Mrs.", "Vandemeyer's face, and during\nher momentary gasp, Tuppence's right hand shot out and grasped the\nrevolver where it lay on the edge of the washstand. The next moment\nshe had sprung back a pace, and the revolver pointed straight at Mrs.\nVandemeyer's heart, with no unsteadiness in the hand that held it.\n\nIn the moment of victory, Tuppence betrayed a somewhat unsportsmanlike\ntriumph.\n\n\"Now who's on top and who's underneath?\" she crowed.\n\nThe other's face was convulsed with rage. For a minute Tuppence thought\nshe was going to spring upon her, which would have placed the girl in an\nunpleasant dilemma, since she meant to draw the line at actually letting\noff the revolver. However, with an effort Mrs. Vandemeyer controlled\nherself, and at last a slow evil smile crept over her face.\n\n\"Not a fool, then, after all! You did that well, girl. But you shall pay\nfor it--oh, yes, you shall pay for it! I have a long memory!\"\n\n\"I'm surprised you should have been gulled so easily,\" said Tuppence\nscornfully. \"Did you really think I was the kind of girl to roll about\non the floor and whine for mercy?\"\n\n\"You may do--some day!\" said the other significantly.\n\nThe cold malignity of her manner sent an unpleasant chill down\nTuppence's spine, but she was not going to give in to it.\n\n\"Supposing we sit down,\" she said pleasantly. \"Our present attitude is\na little melodramatic. No--not on the bed. Draw a chair up to the table,\nthat's right. Now I'll sit opposite you with the revolver in front of\nme--just in case of accidents. Splendid. Now, let's talk.\"\n\n\"What about?\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer sullenly.\n\nTuppence eyed her thoughtfully for a minute. She was remembering several\nthings. Boris's words, \"I believe you would sell-- _us!_\" and her\nanswer, \"The price would have to be enormous,\" given lightly, it was\ntrue, yet might not there be a substratum of truth in it? Long ago,\nhad not Whittington asked: \"Who's been blabbing? Rita?\" Would Rita\nVandemeyer prove to be the weak spot in the armour of Mr.", "Brown?\n\nKeeping her eyes fixed steadily on the other's face, Tuppence replied\nquietly:\n\n\"Money----\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer started. Clearly, the reply was unexpected.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you. You said just now that you had a long memory. A long\nmemory isn't half as useful as a long purse! I dare say it relieves your\nfeelings a good deal to plan out all sorts of dreadful things to do to\nme, but is that _practical?_ Revenge is very unsatisfactory. Every one\nalways says so. But money\"--Tuppence warmed to her pet creed--\"well,\nthere's nothing unsatisfactory about money, is there?\"\n\n\"Do you think,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer scornfully, \"that I am the kind of\nwoman to sell my friends?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Tuppence promptly. \"If the price was big enough.\"\n\n\"A paltry hundred pounds or so!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Tuppence. \"I should suggest--a hundred thousand!\"\n\nHer economical spirit did not permit her to mention the whole million\ndollars suggested by Julius.\n\nA flush crept over Mrs. Vandemeyer's face.\n\n\"What did you say?\" she asked, her fingers playing nervously with a\nbrooch on her breast. In that moment Tuppence knew that the fish was\nhooked, and for the first time she felt a horror of her own money-loving\nspirit. It gave her a dreadful sense of kinship to the woman fronting\nher.\n\n\"A hundred thousand pounds,\" repeated Tuppence.\n\nThe light died out of Mrs. Vandemeyer's eyes. She leaned back in her\nchair.\n\n\"Bah!\" she said. \"You haven't got it.\"\n\n\"No,\" admitted Tuppence, \"I haven't--but I know some one who has.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"A friend of mine.\"\n\n\"Must be a millionaire,\" remarked Mrs. Vandemeyer unbelievingly.\n\n\"As a matter of fact he is. He's an American. He'll pay you that\nwithout a murmur. You can take it from me that it's a perfectly genuine\nproposition.\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer sat up again.\n\n\"I'm inclined to believe you,\" she said slowly.\n\nThere was silence between them for some time, then Mrs. Vandemeyer\nlooked up.\n\n\"What does he want to know, this friend of yours?\"\n\nTuppence went through a momentary struggle, but it was Julius's money,\nand his interests must come first.", "\"He wants to know where Jane Finn is,\" she said boldly.\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer showed no surprise.\n\n\"I'm not sure where she is at the present moment,\" she replied.\n\n\"But you could find out?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" returned Mrs. Vandemeyer carelessly. \"There would be no\ndifficulty about that.\"\n\n\"Then\"--Tuppence's voice shook a little--\"there's a boy, a friend of\nmine. I'm afraid something's happened to him, through your pal Boris.\"\n\n\"What's his name?\"\n\n\"Tommy Beresford.\"\n\n\"Never heard of him. But I'll ask Boris. He'll tell me anything he\nknows.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" Tuppence felt a terrific rise in her spirits. It impelled\nher to more audacious efforts. \"There's one thing more.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nTuppence leaned forward and lowered her voice.\n\n_\"Who is Mr. Brown?\"_\n\nHer quick eyes saw the sudden paling of the beautiful face. With an\neffort Mrs. Vandemeyer pulled herself together and tried to resume her\nformer manner. But the attempt was a mere parody.\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"You can't have learnt much about us if you don't know that _nobody\nknows who Mr. Brown is_....\"\n\n\"You do,\" said Tuppence quietly.\n\nAgain the colour deserted the other's face.\n\n\"What makes you think that?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said the girl truthfully. \"But I'm sure.\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer stared in front of her for a long time.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said hoarsely, at last, \"_I_ know. I was beautiful, you\nsee--very beautiful----\"\n\n\"You are still,\" said Tuppence with admiration.\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer shook her head. There was a strange gleam in her\nelectric-blue eyes.\n\n\"Not beautiful enough,\" she said in a soft dangerous voice.\n\"Not--beautiful--enough! And sometimes, lately, I've been afraid....\nIt's dangerous to know too much!\" She leaned forward across the table.\n\"Swear that my name shan't be brought into it--that no one shall ever\nknow.\"\n\n\"I swear it. And, once's he caught, you'll be out of danger.\"\n\nA terrified look swept across Mrs. Vandemeyer's face.\n\n\"Shall I? Shall I ever be?\" She clutched Tuppence's arm. \"You're sure\nabout the money?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.\"\n\n\"When shall I have it? There must be no delay.\"\n\n\"This friend of mine will be here presently.", "He may have to send cables,\nor something like that. But there won't be any delay--he's a terrific\nhustler.\"\n\nA resolute look settled on Mrs. Vandemeyer's face.\n\n\"I'll do it. It's a great sum of money, and besides\"--she gave a curious\nsmile--\"it is not--wise to throw over a woman like me!\"\n\nFor a moment or two, she remained smiling, and lightly tapping her\nfingers on the table. Suddenly she started, and her face blanched.\n\n\"What was that?\"\n\n\"I heard nothing.\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer gazed round her fearfully.\n\n\"If there should be some one listening----\"\n\n\"Nonsense. Who could there be?\"\n\n\"Even the walls might have ears,\" whispered the other. \"I tell you I'm\nfrightened. You don't know him!\"\n\n\"Think of the hundred thousand pounds,\" said Tuppence soothingly.\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer passed her tongue over her dried lips.\n\n\"You don't know him,\" she reiterated hoarsely. \"He's--ah!\"\n\nWith a shriek of terror she sprang to her feet. Her outstretched hand\npointed over Tuppence's head. Then she swayed to the ground in a dead\nfaint.\n\nTuppence looked round to see what had startled her.\n\nIn the doorway were Sir James Peel Edgerton and Julius Hersheimmer.\n\nSIR James brushed past Julius and hurriedly bent over the fallen woman.\n\n\"Heart,\" he said sharply. \"Seeing us so suddenly must have given her a\nshock. Brandy--and quickly, or she'll slip through our fingers.\"\n\nJulius hurried to the washstand.\n\n\"Not there,\" said Tuppence over her shoulder. \"In the tantalus in the\ndining-room. Second door down the passage.\"\n\nBetween them Sir James and Tuppence lifted Mrs. Vandemeyer and carried\nher to the bed. There they dashed water on her face, but with no result.\nThe lawyer fingered her pulse.\n\n\"Touch and go,\" he muttered. \"I wish that young fellow would hurry up\nwith the brandy.\"\n\nAt that moment Julius re-entered the room, carrying a glass half full of\nthe spirit which he handed to Sir James. While Tuppence lifted her head\nthe lawyer tried to force a little of the spirit between her closed\nlips. Finally the woman opened her eyes feebly. Tuppence held the glass\nto her lips.", "\"Drink this.\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer complied. The brandy brought the colour back to her\nwhite cheeks, and revived her in a marvellous fashion. She tried to sit\nup--then fell back with a groan, her hand to her side.\n\n\"It's my heart,\" she whispered. \"I mustn't talk.\"\n\nShe lay back with closed eyes.\n\nSir James kept his finger on her wrist a minute longer, then withdrew it\nwith a nod.\n\n\"She'll do now.\"\n\nAll three moved away, and stood together talking in low voices. One\nand all were conscious of a certain feeling of anticlimax. Clearly any\nscheme for cross-questioning the lady was out of the question for the\nmoment. For the time being they were baffled, and could do nothing.\n\nTuppence related how Mrs. Vandemeyer had declared herself willing\nto disclose the identity of Mr. Brown, and how she had consented to\ndiscover and reveal to them the whereabouts of Jane Finn. Julius was\ncongratulatory.\n\n\"That's all right, Miss Tuppence. Splendid! I guess that hundred\nthousand pounds will look just as good in the morning to the lady as it\ndid over night. There's nothing to worry over. She won't speak without\nthe cash anyway, you bet!\"\n\nThere was certainly a good deal of common sense in this, and Tuppence\nfelt a little comforted.\n\n\"What you say is true,\" said Sir James meditatively. \"I must confess,\nhowever, that I cannot help wishing we had not interrupted at the minute\nwe did. Still, it cannot be helped, it is only a matter of waiting until\nthe morning.\"\n\nHe looked across at the inert figure on the bed. Mrs. Vandemeyer lay\nperfectly passive with closed eyes. He shook his head.\n\n\"Well,\" said Tuppence, with an attempt at cheerfulness, \"we must wait\nuntil the morning, that's all. But I don't think we ought to leave the\nflat.\"\n\n\"What about leaving that bright boy of yours on guard?\"\n\n\"Albert? And suppose she came round again and hooked it. Albert couldn't\nstop her.\"\n\n\"I guess she won't want to make tracks away from the dollars.\"\n\n\"She might. She seemed very frightened of 'Mr. Brown.'\"", "\"What? Real plumb scared of him?\"\n\n\"Yes. She looked round and said even walls had ears.\"\n\n\"Maybe she meant a dictaphone,\" said Julius with interest.\n\n\"Miss Tuppence is right,\" said Sir James quietly. \"We must not leave the\nflat--if only for Mrs. Vandemeyer's sake.\"\n\nJulius stared at him.\n\n\"You think he'd get after her? Between now and to-morrow morning. How\ncould he know, even?\"\n\n\"You forget your own suggestion of a dictaphone,\" said Sir James dryly.\n\"We have a very formidable adversary. I believe, if we exercise all due\ncare, that there is a very good chance of his being delivered into our\nhands. But we must neglect no precaution. We have an important witness,\nbut she must be safeguarded. I would suggest that Miss Tuppence should\ngo to bed, and that you and I, Mr. Hersheimmer, should share the vigil.\"\n\nTuppence was about to protest, but happening to glance at the bed she\nsaw Mrs. Vandemeyer, her eyes half-open, with such an expression of\nmingled fear and malevolence on her face that it quite froze the words\non her lips.\n\nFor a moment she wondered whether the faint and the heart attack had\nbeen a gigantic sham, but remembering the deadly pallor she could hardly\ncredit the supposition. As she looked the expression disappeared as by\nmagic, and Mrs. Vandemeyer lay inert and motionless as before. For a\nmoment the girl fancied she must have dreamt it. But she determined\nnevertheless to be on the alert.\n\n\"Well,\" said Julius, \"I guess we'd better make a move out of here any\nway.\"\n\nThe others fell in with his suggestion. Sir James again felt Mrs.\nVandemeyer's pulse.\n\n\"Perfectly satisfactory,\" he said in a low voice to Tuppence. \"She'll be\nabsolutely all right after a night's rest.\"\n\nThe girl hesitated a moment by the bed. The intensity of the expression\nshe had surprised had impressed her powerfully. Mrs. Vandemeyer lifted\nher lids. She seemed to be struggling to speak. Tuppence bent over her.\n\n\"Don't--leave----\" she seemed unable to proceed, murmuring something\nthat sounded like \"sleepy.\" Then she tried again.", "Tuppence bent lower still. It was only a breath.\n\n\"Mr.--Brown----\" The voice stopped.\n\nBut the half-closed eyes seemed still to send an agonized message.\n\nMoved by a sudden impulse, the girl said quickly:\n\n\"I shan't leave the flat. I shall sit up all night.\"\n\nA flash of relief showed before the lids descended once more. Apparently\nMrs. Vandemeyer slept. But her words had awakened a new uneasiness in\nTuppence. What had she meant by that low murmur: \"Mr. Brown?\" Tuppence\ncaught herself nervously looking over her shoulder. The big wardrobe\nloomed up in a sinister fashion before her eyes. Plenty of room for a\nman to hide in that.... Half-ashamed of herself, Tuppence pulled it open\nand looked inside. No one--of course! She stooped down and looked under\nthe bed. There was no other possible hiding-place.\n\nTuppence gave her familiar shake of the shoulders. It was absurd, this\ngiving way to nerves! Slowly she went out of the room. Julius and Sir\nJames were talking in a low voice. Sir James turned to her.\n\n\"Lock the door on the outside, please, Miss Tuppence, and take out the\nkey. There must be no chance of anyone entering that room.\"\n\nThe gravity of his manner impressed them, and Tuppence felt less ashamed\nof her attack of \"nerves.\"\n\n\"Say,\" remarked Julius suddenly, \"there's Tuppence's bright boy. I guess\nI'd better go down and ease his young mind. That's some lad, Tuppence.\"\n\n\"How did you get in, by the way?\" asked Tuppence suddenly. \"I forgot to\nask.\"\n\n\"Well, Albert got me on the phone all right. I ran round for Sir James\nhere, and we came right on. The boy was on the look out for us, and was\njust a mite worried about what might have happened to you. He'd been\nlistening outside the door of the flat, but couldn't hear anything.\nAnyhow he suggested sending us up in the coal lift instead of ringing\nthe bell. And sure enough we landed in the scullery and came right along\nto find you. Albert's still below, and must be just hopping mad by this\ntime.\"", "With which Julius departed abruptly.\n\n\"Now then, Miss Tuppence,\" said Sir James, \"you know this place better\nthan I do. Where do you suggest we should take up our quarters?\"\n\nTuppence considered for a moment or two.\n\n\"I think Mrs. Vandemeyer's boudoir would be the most comfortable,\" she\nsaid at last, and led the way there.\n\nSir James looked round approvingly.\n\n\"This will do very well, and now, my dear young lady, do go to bed and\nget some sleep.\"\n\nTuppence shook her head resolutely.\n\n\"I couldn't, thank you, Sir James. I should dream of Mr. Brown all\nnight!\"\n\n\"But you'll be so tired, child.\"\n\n\"No, I shan't. I'd rather stay up--really.\"\n\nThe lawyer gave in.\n\nJulius reappeared some minutes later, having reassured Albert and\nrewarded him lavishly for his services. Having in his turn failed to\npersuade Tuppence to go to bed, he said decisively:\n\n\"At any rate, you've got to have something to eat right away. Where's\nthe larder?\"\n\nTuppence directed him, and he returned in a few minutes with a cold pie\nand three plates.\n\nAfter a hearty meal, the girl felt inclined to pooh-pooh her fancies of\nhalf an hour before. The power of the money bribe could not fail.\n\n\"And now, Miss Tuppence,\" said Sir James, \"we want to hear your\nadventures.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" agreed Julius.\n\nTuppence narrated her adventures with some complacence. Julius\noccasionally interjected an admiring \"Bully.\" Sir James said nothing\nuntil she had finished, when his quiet \"well done, Miss Tuppence,\" made\nher flush with pleasure.\n\n\"There's one thing I don't get clearly,\" said Julius. \"What put her up\nto clearing out?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" confessed Tuppence.\n\nSir James stroked his chin thoughtfully.\n\n\"The room was in great disorder. That looks as though her flight was\nunpremeditated. Almost as though she got a sudden warning to go from\nsome one.\"\n\n\"Mr. Brown, I suppose,\" said Julius scoffingly.\n\nThe lawyer looked at him deliberately for a minute or two.\n\n\"Why not?\" he said. \"Remember, you yourself have once been worsted by\nhim.\"\n\nJulius flushed with vexation.\n\n\"I feel just mad when I think of how I handed out Jane's photograph to\nhim like a lamb.", "Gee, if I ever lay hands on it again, I'll freeze on to\nit like--like hell!\"\n\n\"That contingency is likely to be a remote one,\" said the other dryly.\n\n\"I guess you're right,\" said Julius frankly. \"And, in any case, it's the\noriginal I'm out after. Where do you think she can be, Sir James?\"\n\nThe lawyer shook his head.\n\n\"Impossible to say. But I've a very good idea where she _has_ been.\"\n\n\"You have? Where?\"\n\nSir James smiled.\n\n\"At the scene of your nocturnal adventures, the Bournemouth nursing\nhome.\"\n\n\"There? Impossible. I asked.\"\n\n\"No, my dear sir, you asked if anyone of the name of Jane Finn had been\nthere. Now, if the girl had been placed there it would almost certainly\nbe under an assumed name.\"\n\n\"Bully for you,\" cried Julius. \"I never thought of that!\"\n\n\"It was fairly obvious,\" said the other.\n\n\"Perhaps the doctor's in it too,\" suggested Tuppence.\n\nJulius shook his head.\n\n\"I don't think so. I took to him at once. No, I'm pretty sure Dr. Hall's\nall right.\"\n\n\"Hall, did you say?\" asked Sir James. \"That is curious--really very\ncurious.\"\n\n\"Why?\" demanded Tuppence.\n\n\"Because I happened to meet him this morning. I've known him slightly on\nand off for some years, and this morning I ran across him in the street.\nStaying at the _Metropole_, he told me.\" He turned to Julius. \"Didn't\nhe tell you he was coming up to town?\"\n\nJulius shook his head.\n\n\"Curious,\" mused Sir James. \"You did not mention his name this\nafternoon, or I would have suggested your going to him for further\ninformation with my card as introduction.\"\n\n\"I guess I'm a mutt,\" said Julius with unusual humility. \"I ought to\nhave thought of the false name stunt.\"\n\n\"How could you think of anything after falling out of that tree?\" cried\nTuppence. \"I'm sure anyone else would have been killed right off.\"\n\n\"Well, I guess it doesn't matter now, anyway,\" said Julius. \"We've got\nMrs. Vandemeyer on a string, and that's all we need.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Tuppence, but there was a lack of assurance in her voice.", "A silence settled down over the party. Little by little the magic of\nthe night began to gain a hold on them. There were sudden creaks of the\nfurniture, imperceptible rustlings in the curtains. Suddenly Tuppence\nsprang up with a cry.\n\n\"I can't help it. I know Mr. Brown's somewhere in the flat! I can _feel_\nhim.\"\n\n\"Sure, Tuppence, how could he be? This door's open into the hall. No\none could have come in by the front door without our seeing and hearing\nhim.\"\n\n\"I can't help it. I _feel_ he's here!\"\n\nShe looked appealingly at Sir James, who replied gravely:\n\n\"With due deference to your feelings, Miss Tuppence (and mine as well\nfor that matter), I do not see how it is humanly possible for anyone to\nbe in the flat without our knowledge.\"\n\nThe girl was a little comforted by his words.\n\n\"Sitting up at night is always rather jumpy,\" she confessed.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Sir James. \"We are in the condition of people holding a\nseance. Perhaps if a medium were present we might get some marvellous\nresults.\"\n\n\"Do you believe in spiritualism?\" asked Tuppence, opening her eyes wide.\n\nThe lawyer shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"There is some truth in it, without a doubt. But most of the testimony\nwould not pass muster in the witness-box.\"\n\nThe hours drew on. With the first faint glimmerings of dawn, Sir James\ndrew aside the curtains. They beheld, what few Londoners see, the slow\nrising of the sun over the sleeping city. Somehow, with the coming\nof the light, the dreads and fancies of the past night seemed absurd.\nTuppence's spirits revived to the normal.\n\n\"Hooray!\" she said. \"It's going to be a gorgeous day. And we shall find\nTommy. And Jane Finn. And everything will be lovely. I shall ask Mr.\nCarter if I can't be made a Dame!\"\n\nAt seven o'clock Tuppence volunteered to go and make some tea. She\nreturned with a tray, containing the teapot and four cups.\n\n\"Who's the other cup for?\" inquired Julius.\n\n\"The prisoner, of course. I suppose we might call her that?\"", "\"Taking her tea seems a kind of anticlimax to last night,\" said Julius\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"Yes, it does,\" admitted Tuppence. \"But, anyway, here goes. Perhaps\nyou'd both come, too, in case she springs on me, or anything. You see,\nwe don't know what mood she'll wake up in.\"\n\nSir James and Julius accompanied her to the door.\n\n\"Where's the key? Oh, of course, I've got it myself.\"\n\nShe put it in the lock, and turned it, then paused.\n\n\"Supposing, after all, she's escaped?\" she murmured in a whisper.\n\n\"Plumb impossible,\" replied Julius reassuringly.\n\nBut Sir James said nothing.\n\nTuppence drew a long breath and entered. She heaved a sigh of relief as\nshe saw that Mrs. Vandemeyer was lying on the bed.\n\n\"Good morning,\" she remarked cheerfully. \"I've brought you some tea.\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer did not reply. Tuppence put down the cup on the table\nby the bed and went across to draw up the blinds. When she turned, Mrs.\nVandemeyer still lay without a movement. With a sudden fear clutching\nat her heart, Tuppence ran to the bed. The hand she lifted was cold as\nice.... Mrs. Vandemeyer would never speak now....\n\nHer cry brought the others. A very few minutes sufficed. Mrs. Vandemeyer\nwas dead--must have been dead some hours. She had evidently died in her\nsleep.\n\n\"If that isn't the cruellest luck,\" cried Julius in despair.\n\nThe lawyer was calmer, but there was a curious gleam in his eyes.\n\n\"If it is luck,\" he replied.\n\n\"You don't think--but, say, that's plumb impossible--no one could have\ngot in.\"\n\n\"No,\" admitted the lawyer. \"I don't see how they could. And yet--she is\non the point of betraying Mr. Brown, and--she dies. Is it only chance?\"\n\n\"But how----\"\n\n\"Yes, _how!_ That is what we must find out.\" He stood there silently,\ngently stroking his chin. \"We must find out,\" he said quietly, and\nTuppence felt that if she was Mr. Brown she would not like the tone of\nthose simple words.\n\nJulius's glance went to the window.\n\n\"The window's open,\" he remarked. \"Do you think----\"\n\nTuppence shook her head.", "\"The balcony only goes along as far as the boudoir. We were there.\"\n\n\"He might have slipped out----\" suggested Julius.\n\nBut Sir James interrupted him.\n\n\"Mr. Brown's methods are not so crude. In the meantime we must send for\na doctor, but before we do so, is there anything in this room that might\nbe of value to us?\"\n\nHastily, the three searched. A charred mass in the grate indicated\nthat Mrs. Vandemeyer had been burning papers on the eve of her flight.\nNothing of importance remained, though they searched the other rooms as\nwell.\n\n\"There's that,\" said Tuppence suddenly, pointing to a small,\nold-fashioned safe let into the wall. \"It's for jewellery, I believe,\nbut there might be something else in it.\"\n\nThe key was in the lock, and Julius swung open the door, and searched\ninside. He was some time over the task.\n\n\"Well,\" said Tuppence impatiently.\n\nThere was a pause before Julius answered, then he withdrew his head and\nshut to the door.\n\n\"Nothing,\" he said.\n\nIn five minutes a brisk young doctor arrived, hastily summoned. He was\ndeferential to Sir James, whom he recognized.\n\n\"Heart failure, or possibly an overdose of some sleeping-draught.\" He\nsniffed. \"Rather an odour of chloral in the air.\"\n\nTuppence remembered the glass she had upset. A new thought drove her to\nthe washstand. She found the little bottle from which Mrs. Vandemeyer\nhad poured a few drops.\n\nIt had been three parts full. Now-- _it was empty_.\n\nNOTHING was more surprising and bewildering to Tuppence than the ease\nand simplicity with which everything was arranged, owing to Sir James's\nskilful handling. The doctor accepted quite readily the theory that Mrs.\nVandemeyer had accidentally taken an overdose of chloral. He doubted\nwhether an inquest would be necessary. If so, he would let Sir James\nknow. He understood that Mrs. Vandemeyer was on the eve of departure for\nabroad, and that the servants had already left? Sir James and his young\nfriends had been paying a call upon her, when she was suddenly stricken\ndown and they had spent the night in the flat, not liking to leave\nher alone.", "Did they know of any relatives? They did not, but Sir James\nreferred him to Mrs. Vandemeyer's solicitor.\n\nShortly afterwards a nurse arrived to take charge, and the other left\nthe ill-omened building.\n\n\"And what now?\" asked Julius, with a gesture of despair. \"I guess we're\ndown and out for good.\"\n\nSir James stroked his chin thoughtfully.\n\n\"No,\" he said quietly. \"There is still the chance that Dr. Hall may be\nable to tell us something.\"\n\n\"Gee! I'd forgotten him.\"\n\n\"The chance is slight, but it must not be neglected. I think I told you\nthat he is staying at the _Metropole_. I should suggest that we call\nupon him there as soon as possible. Shall we say after a bath and\nbreakfast?\"\n\nIt was arranged that Tuppence and Julius should return to the _Ritz_,\nand call for Sir James in the car. This programme was faithfully carried\nout, and a little after eleven they drew up before the _Metropole_.\nThey asked for Dr. Hall, and a page-boy went in search of him. In a few\nminutes the little doctor came hurrying towards them.\n\n\"Can you spare us a few minutes, Dr. Hall?\" said Sir James pleasantly.\n\"Let me introduce you to Miss Cowley. Mr. Hersheimmer, I think, you\nalready know.\"\n\nA quizzical gleam came into the doctor's eye as he shook hands with\nJulius.\n\n\"Ah, yes, my young friend of the tree episode! Ankle all right, eh?\"\n\n\"I guess it's cured owing to your skilful treatment, doc.\"\n\n\"And the heart trouble? Ha ha!\"\n\n\"Still searching,\" said Julius briefly.\n\n\"To come to the point, can we have a word with you in private?\" asked\nSir James.\n\n\"Certainly. I think there is a room here where we shall be quite\nundisturbed.\"\n\nHe led the way, and the others followed him. They sat down, and the\ndoctor looked inquiringly at Sir James.\n\n\"Dr. Hall, I am very anxious to find a certain young lady for the\npurpose of obtaining a statement from her. I have reason to believe\nthat she has been at one time or another in your establishment at\nBournemouth.", "I hope I am transgressing no professional etiquette in\nquestioning you on the subject?\"\n\n\"I suppose it is a matter of testimony?\"\n\nSir James hesitated a moment, then he replied:\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I shall be pleased to give you any information in my power. What is\nthe young lady's name? Mr. Hersheimmer asked me, I remember----\" He half\nturned to Julius.\n\n\"The name,\" said Sir James bluntly, \"is really immaterial. She would be\nalmost certainly sent to you under an assumed one. But I should like to\nknow if you are acquainted with a Mrs. Vandemeyer?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer, of 20 South Audley Mansions? I know her slightly.\"\n\n\"You are not aware of what has happened?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You do not know that Mrs. Vandemeyer is dead?\"\n\n\"Dear, dear, I had no idea of it! When did it happen?\"\n\n\"She took an overdose of chloral last night.\"\n\n\"Purposely?\"\n\n\"Accidentally, it is believed. I should not like to say myself. Anyway,\nshe was found dead this morning.\"\n\n\"Very sad. A singularly handsome woman. I presume she was a friend of\nyours, since you are acquainted with all these details.\"\n\n\"I am acquainted with the details because--well, it was I who found her\ndead.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said the doctor, starting.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Sir James, and stroked his chin reflectively.\n\n\"This is very sad news, but you will excuse me if I say that I do not\nsee how it bears on the subject of your inquiry?\"\n\n\"It bears on it in this way, is it not a fact that Mrs. Vandemeyer\ncommitted a young relative of hers to your charge?\"\n\nJulius leaned forward eagerly.\n\n\"That is the case,\" said the doctor quietly.\n\n\"Under the name of----?\"\n\n\"Janet Vandemeyer. I understood her to be a niece of Mrs. Vandemeyer's.\"\n\n\"And she came to you?\"\n\n\"As far as I can remember in June or July of 1915.\"\n\n\"Was she a mental case?\"\n\n\"She is perfectly sane, if that is what you mean. I understood from Mrs.\nVandemeyer that the girl had been with her on the _Lusitania_ when\nthat ill-fated ship was sunk, and had suffered a severe shock in\nconsequence.\"", "\"We're on the right track, I think?\" Sir James looked round.\n\n\"As I said before, I'm a mutt!\" returned Julius.\n\nThe doctor looked at them all curiously.\n\n\"You spoke of wanting a statement from her,\" he said. \"Supposing she is\nnot able to give one?\"\n\n\"What? You have just said that she is perfectly sane.\"\n\n\"So she is. Nevertheless, if you want a statement from her concerning\nany events prior to May 7, 1915, she will not be able to give it to\nyou.\"\n\nThey looked at the little man, stupefied. He nodded cheerfully.\n\n\"It's a pity,\" he said. \"A great pity, especially as I gather, Sir\nJames, that the matter is important. But there it is, she can tell you\nnothing.\"\n\n\"But why, man? Darn it all, why?\"\n\nThe little man shifted his benevolent glance to the excited young\nAmerican.\n\n\"Because Janet Vandemeyer is suffering from a complete loss of memory.\"\n\n_\"What?\"_\n\n\"Quite so. An interesting case, a _very_ interesting case. Not so\nuncommon, really, as you would think. There are several very well known\nparallels. It's the first case of the kind that I've had under my own\npersonal observation, and I must admit that I've found it of absorbing\ninterest.\" There was something rather ghoulish in the little man's\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"And she remembers nothing,\" said Sir James slowly.\n\n\"Nothing prior to May 7, 1915. After that date her memory is as good as\nyours or mine.\"\n\n\"Then the first thing she remembers?\"\n\n\"Is landing with the survivors. Everything before that is a blank. She\ndid not know her own name, or where she had come from, or where she was.\nShe couldn't even speak her own tongue.\"\n\n\"But surely all this is most unusual?\" put in Julius.\n\n\"No, my dear sir. Quite normal under the circumstances. Severe shock to\nthe nervous system. Loss of memory proceeds nearly always on the same\nlines. I suggested a specialist, of course. There's a very good man in\nParis--makes a study of these cases--but Mrs. Vandemeyer opposed the\nidea of publicity that might result from such a course.\"\n\n\"I can imagine she would,\" said Sir James grimly.", "\"I fell in with her views. There is a certain notoriety given to these\ncases. And the girl was very young--nineteen, I believe. It seemed\na pity that her infirmity should be talked about--might damage her\nprospects. Besides, there is no special treatment to pursue in such\ncases. It is really a matter of waiting.\"\n\n\"Waiting?\"\n\n\"Yes, sooner or later, the memory will return--as suddenly as it\nwent. But in all probability the girl will have entirely forgotten the\nintervening period, and will take up life where she left off--at the\nsinking of the _Lusitania_.\"\n\n\"And when do you expect this to happen?\"\n\nThe doctor shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Ah, that I cannot say. Sometimes it is a matter of months, sometimes\nit has been known to be as long as twenty years! Sometimes another shock\ndoes the trick. One restores what the other took away.\"\n\n\"Another shock, eh?\" said Julius thoughtfully.\n\n\"Exactly. There was a case in Colorado----\" The little man's voice\ntrailed on, voluble, mildly enthusiastic.\n\nJulius did not seem to be listening. He had relapsed into his own\nthoughts and was frowning. Suddenly he came out of his brown study,\nand hit the table such a resounding bang with his fist that every one\njumped, the doctor most of all.\n\n\"I've got it! I guess, doc, I'd like your medical opinion on the plan\nI'm about to outline. Say Jane was to cross the herring pond again, and\nthe same thing was to happen. The submarine, the sinking ship, every one\nto take to the boats--and so on. Wouldn't that do the trick? Wouldn't it\ngive a mighty big bump to her subconscious self, or whatever the jargon\nis, and start it functioning again right away?\"\n\n\"A very interesting speculation, Mr. Hersheimmer. In my own opinion, it\nwould be successful. It is unfortunate that there is no chance of the\nconditions repeating themselves as you suggest.\"\n\n\"Not by nature, perhaps, doc. But I'm talking about art.\"\n\n\"Art?\"\n\n\"Why, yes. What's the difficulty? Hire a liner----\"\n\n\"A liner!\" murmured Dr. Hall faintly.\n\n\"Hire some passengers, hire a submarine--that's the only difficulty, I\nguess.", "Governments are apt to be a bit hide-bound over their engines of\nwar. They won't sell to the first-comer. Still, I guess that can be got\nover. Ever heard of the word 'graft,' sir? Well, graft gets there every\ntime! I reckon that we shan't really need to fire a torpedo. If every\none hustles round and screams loud enough that the ship is sinking, it\nought to be enough for an innocent young girl like Jane. By the time\nshe's got a life-belt on her, and is being hustled into a boat, with\na well-drilled lot of artistes doing the hysterical stunt on deck,\nwhy--she ought to be right back where she was in May, 1915. How's that\nfor the bare outline?\"\n\nDr. Hall looked at Julius. Everything that he was for the moment\nincapable of saying was eloquent in that look.\n\n\"No,\" said Julius, in answer to it, \"I'm not crazy. The thing's\nperfectly possible. It's done every day in the States for the movies.\nHaven't you seen trains in collision on the screen? What's the\ndifference between buying up a train and buying up a liner? Get the\nproperties and you can go right ahead!\"\n\nDr. Hall found his voice.\n\n\"But the expense, my dear sir.\" His voice rose. \"The expense! It will be\n_colossal!_\"\n\n\"Money doesn't worry me any,\" explained Julius simply.\n\nDr. Hall turned an appealing face to Sir James, who smiled slightly.\n\n\"Mr. Hersheimmer is very well off--very well off indeed.\"\n\nThe doctor's glance came back to Julius with a new and subtle quality in\nit. This was no longer an eccentric young fellow with a habit of falling\noff trees. The doctor's eyes held the deference accorded to a really\nrich man.\n\n\"Very remarkable plan. Very remarkable,\" he murmured. \"The movies--of\ncourse! Your American word for the kinema. Very interesting. I fear we\nare perhaps a little behind the times over here in our methods. And you\nreally mean to carry out this remarkable plan of yours.\"\n\n\"You bet your bottom dollar I do.\"\n\nThe doctor believed him--which was a tribute to his nationality.", "If an\nEnglishman had suggested such a thing, he would have had grave doubts as\nto his sanity.\n\n\"I cannot guarantee a cure,\" he pointed out. \"Perhaps I ought to make\nthat quite clear.\"\n\n\"Sure, that's all right,\" said Julius. \"You just trot out Jane, and\nleave the rest to me.\"\n\n\"Jane?\"\n\n\"Miss Janet Vandemeyer, then. Can we get on the long distance to your\nplace right away, and ask them to send her up; or shall I run down and\nfetch her in my car?\"\n\nThe doctor stared.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Mr. Hersheimmer. I thought you understood.\"\n\n\"Understood what?\"\n\n\"That Miss Vandemeyer is no longer under my care.\"\n\nJULIUS sprang up.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I thought you were aware of that.\"\n\n\"When did she leave?\"\n\n\"Let me see. To-day is Monday, is it not? It must have been last\nWednesday--why, surely--yes, it was the same evening that you--er--fell\nout of my tree.\"\n\n\"That evening? Before, or after?\"\n\n\"Let me see--oh yes, afterwards. A very urgent message arrived from Mrs.\nVandemeyer. The young lady and the nurse who was in charge of her left\nby the night train.\"\n\nJulius sank back again into his chair.\n\n\"Nurse Edith--left with a patient--I remember,\" he muttered. \"My God, to\nhave been so near!\"\n\nDr. Hall looked bewildered.\n\n\"I don't understand. Is the young lady not with her aunt, after all?\"\n\nTuppence shook her head. She was about to speak when a warning glance\nfrom Sir James made her hold her tongue. The lawyer rose.\n\n\"I'm much obliged to you, Hall. We're very grateful for all you've\ntold us. I'm afraid we're now in the position of having to track Miss\nVandemeyer anew. What about the nurse who accompanied her; I suppose you\ndon't know where she is?\"\n\nThe doctor shook his head.\n\n\"We've not heard from her, as it happens. I understood she was to remain\nwith Miss Vandemeyer for a while. But what can have happened? Surely the\ngirl has not been kidnapped.\"\n\n\"That remains to be seen,\" said Sir James gravely.\n\nThe other hesitated.", "\"You do not think I ought to go to the police?\"\n\n\"No, no. In all probability the young lady is with other relations.\"\n\nThe doctor was not completely satisfied, but he saw that Sir James was\ndetermined to say no more, and realized that to try and extract\nmore information from the famous K.C. would be mere waste of labour.\nAccordingly, he wished them goodbye, and they left the hotel. For a few\nminutes they stood by the car talking.\n\n\"How maddening,\" cried Tuppence. \"To think that Julius must have been\nactually under the same roof with her for a few hours.\"\n\n\"I was a darned idiot,\" muttered Julius gloomily.\n\n\"You couldn't know,\" Tuppence consoled him. \"Could he?\" She appealed to\nSir James.\n\n\"I should advise you not to worry,\" said the latter kindly. \"No use\ncrying over spilt milk, you know.\"\n\n\"The great thing is what to do next,\" added Tuppence the practical.\n\nSir James shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"You might advertise for the nurse who accompanied the girl. That is\nthe only course I can suggest, and I must confess I do not hope for much\nresult. Otherwise there is nothing to be done.\"\n\n\"Nothing?\" said Tuppence blankly. \"And--Tommy?\"\n\n\"We must hope for the best,\" said Sir James. \"Oh yes, we must go on\nhoping.\"\n\nBut over her downcast head his eyes met Julius's, and almost\nimperceptibly he shook his head. Julius understood. The lawyer\nconsidered the case hopeless. The young American's face grew grave. Sir\nJames took Tuppence's hand.\n\n\"You must let me know if anything further comes to light. Letters will\nalways be forwarded.\"\n\nTuppence stared at him blankly.\n\n\"You are going away?\"\n\n\"I told you. Don't you remember? To Scotland.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I thought----\" The girl hesitated.\n\nSir James shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"My dear young lady, I can do nothing more, I fear. Our clues have all\nended in thin air. You can take my word for it that there is nothing\nmore to be done. If anything should arise, I shall be glad to advise you\nin any way I can.\"\n\nHis words gave Tuppence an extraordinarily desolate feeling.", "\"I suppose you're right,\" she said. \"Anyway, thank you very much for\ntrying to help us. Good-bye.\"\n\nJulius was bending over the car. A momentary pity came into Sir James's\nkeen eyes, as he gazed into the girl's downcast face.\n\n\"Don't be too disconsolate, Miss Tuppence,\" he said in a low voice.\n\"Remember, holiday-time isn't always all playtime. One sometimes manages\nto put in some work as well.\"\n\nSomething in his tone made Tuppence glance up sharply. He shook his head\nwith a smile.\n\n\"No, I shan't say any more. Great mistake to say too much. Remember\nthat. Never tell all you know--not even to the person you know best.\nUnderstand? Good-bye.\"\n\nHe strode away. Tuppence stared after him. She was beginning to\nunderstand Sir James's methods. Once before he had thrown her a hint\nin the same careless fashion. Was this a hint? What exactly lay\nbehind those last brief words? Did he mean that, after all, he had not\nabandoned the case; that, secretly, he would be working on it still\nwhile----\n\nHer meditations were interrupted by Julius, who adjured her to \"get\nright in.\"\n\n\"You're looking kind of thoughtful,\" he remarked as they started off.\n\"Did the old guy say anything more?\"\n\nTuppence opened her mouth impulsively, and then shut it again. Sir\nJames's words sounded in her ears: \"Never tell all you know--not even\nto the person you know best.\" And like a flash there came into her mind\nanother memory. Julius before the safe in the flat, her own question and\nthe pause before his reply, \"Nothing.\" Was there really nothing? Or\nhad he found something he wished to keep to himself? If he could make a\nreservation, so could she.\n\n\"Nothing particular,\" she replied.\n\nShe felt rather than saw Julius throw a sideways glance at her.\n\n\"Say, shall we go for a spin in the park?\"\n\n\"If you like.\"\n\nFor a while they ran on under the trees in silence. It was a beautiful\nday. The keen rush through the air brought a new exhilaration to\nTuppence.\n\n\"Say, Miss Tuppence, do you think I'm ever going to find Jane?\"", "Julius spoke in a discouraged voice. The mood was so alien to him that\nTuppence turned and stared at him in surprise. He nodded.\n\n\"That's so. I'm getting down and out over the business. Sir James to-day\nhadn't got any hope at all, I could see that. I don't like him--we don't\ngee together somehow--but he's pretty cute, and I guess he wouldn't quit\nif there was any chance of success--now, would he?\"\n\nTuppence felt rather uncomfortable, but clinging to her belief that\nJulius also had withheld something from her, she remained firm.\n\n\"He suggested advertising for the nurse,\" she reminded him.\n\n\"Yes, with a 'forlorn hope' flavour to his voice! No--I'm about fed up.\nI've half a mind to go back to the States right away.\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" cried Tuppence. \"We've got to find Tommy.\"\n\n\"I sure forgot Beresford,\" said Julius contritely. \"That's so. We must\nfind him. But after--well, I've been day-dreaming ever since I started\non this trip--and these dreams are rotten poor business. I'm quit of\nthem. Say, Miss Tuppence, there's something I'd like to ask you.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"You and Beresford. What about it?\"\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" replied Tuppence with dignity, adding rather\ninconsequently: \"And, anyway, you're wrong!\"\n\n\"Not got a sort of kindly feeling for one another?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Tuppence with warmth. \"Tommy and I are\nfriends--nothing more.\"\n\n\"I guess every pair of lovers has said that sometime or another,\"\n observed Julius.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" snapped Tuppence. \"Do I look the sort of girl that's always\nfalling in love with every man she meets?\"\n\n\"You do not. You look the sort of girl that's mighty often getting\nfallen in love with!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence, rather taken aback. \"That's a compliment, I\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"Sure. Now let's get down to this. Supposing we never find Beresford\nand--and----\"\n\n\"All right--say it! I can face facts. Supposing he's--dead! Well?\"\n\n\"And all this business fiddles out. What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Tuppence forlornly.\n\n\"You'll be darned lonesome, you poor kid.\"\n\n\"I shall be all right,\" snapped Tuppence with her usual resentment of\nany kind of pity.", "\"What about marriage?\" inquired Julius. \"Got any views on the subject?\"\n\n\"I intend to marry, of course,\" replied Tuppence. \"That is, if\"--she\npaused, knew a momentary longing to draw back, and then stuck to her\nguns bravely--\"I can find some one rich enough to make it worth my\nwhile. That's frank, isn't it? I dare say you despise me for it.\"\n\n\"I never despise business instinct,\" said Julius. \"What particular\nfigure have you in mind?\"\n\n\"Figure?\" asked Tuppence, puzzled. \"Do you mean tall or short?\"\n\n\"No. Sum--income.\"\n\n\"Oh, I--I haven't quite worked that out.\"\n\n\"What about me?\"\n\n_\"You?\"_\n\n\"Sure thing.\"\n\n\"Oh, I couldn't!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I tell you I couldn't.\"\n\n\"Again, why not?\"\n\n\"It would seem so unfair.\"\n\n\"I don't see anything unfair about it. I call your bluff, that's all. I\nadmire you immensely, Miss Tuppence, more than any girl I've ever met.\nYou're so darned plucky. I'd just love to give you a real, rattling good\ntime. Say the word, and we'll run round right away to some high-class\njeweller, and fix up the ring business.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" gasped Tuppence.\n\n\"Because of Beresford?\"\n\n\"No, no, _no!_\"\n\n\"Well then?\"\n\nTuppence merely continued to shake her head violently.\n\n\"You can't reasonably expect more dollars than I've got.\"\n\n\"Oh, it isn't that,\" gasped Tuppence with an almost hysterical laugh.\n\"But thanking you very much, and all that, I think I'd better say no.\"\n\n\"I'd be obliged if you'd do me the favour to think it over until\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"It's no use.\"\n\n\"Still, I guess we'll leave it like that.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Tuppence meekly.\n\nNeither of them spoke again until they reached the _Ritz_.\n\nTuppence went upstairs to her room. She felt morally battered to the\nground after her conflict with Julius's vigorous personality. Sitting\ndown in front of the glass, she stared at her own reflection for some\nminutes.\n\n\"Fool,\" murmured Tuppence at length, making a grimace. \"Little fool.\nEverything you want--everything you've ever hoped for, and you go and\nbleat out 'no' like an idiotic little sheep. It's your one chance. Why\ndon't you take it?", "Grab it? Snatch at it? What more do you want?\"\n\nAs if in answer to her own question, her eyes fell on a small snapshot\nof Tommy that stood on her dressing-table in a shabby frame. For a\nmoment she struggled for self-control, and then abandoning all presence,\nshe held it to her lips and burst into a fit of sobbing.\n\n\"Oh, Tommy, Tommy,\" she cried, \"I do love you so--and I may never see\nyou again....\"\n\nAt the end of five minutes Tuppence sat up, blew her nose, and pushed\nback her hair.\n\n\"That's that,\" she observed sternly. \"Let's look facts in the face. I\nseem to have fallen in love--with an idiot of a boy who probably doesn't\ncare two straws about me.\" Here she paused. \"Anyway,\" she resumed, as\nthough arguing with an unseen opponent, \"I don't _know_ that he does.\nHe'd never have dared to say so. I've always jumped on sentiment--and\nhere I am being more sentimental than anybody. What idiots girls are!\nI've always thought so. I suppose I shall sleep with his photograph\nunder my pillow, and dream about him all night. It's dreadful to feel\nyou've been false to your principles.\"\n\nTuppence shook her head sadly, as she reviewed her backsliding.\n\n\"I don't know what to say to Julius, I'm sure. Oh, what a fool I feel!\nI'll have to say _something_--he's so American and thorough, he'll\ninsist upon having a reason. I wonder if he did find anything in that\nsafe----\"\n\nTuppence's meditations went off on another tack. She reviewed the events\nof last night carefully and persistently. Somehow, they seemed bound up\nwith Sir James's enigmatical words....\n\nSuddenly she gave a great start--the colour faded out of her face. Her\neyes, fascinated, gazed in front of her, the pupils dilated.\n\n\"Impossible,\" she murmured. \"Impossible! I must be going mad even to\nthink of such a thing....\"\n\nMonstrous--yet it explained everything....\n\nAfter a moment's reflection she sat down and wrote a note, weighing each\nword as she did so. Finally she nodded her head as though satisfied, and\nslipped it into an envelope which she addressed to Julius.", "She went\ndown the passage to his sitting-room and knocked at the door. As she had\nexpected, the room was empty. She left the note on the table.\n\nA small page-boy was waiting outside her own door when she returned to\nit.\n\n\"Telegram for you, miss.\"\n\nTuppence took it from the salver, and tore it open carelessly. Then she\ngave a cry. The telegram was from Tommy!\n\nFROM a darkness punctuated with throbbing stabs of fire, Tommy dragged\nhis senses slowly back to life. When he at last opened his eyes, he was\nconscious of nothing but an excruciating pain through his temples. He\nwas vaguely aware of unfamiliar surroundings. Where was he? What had\nhappened? He blinked feebly. This was not his bedroom at the _Ritz_. And\nwhat the devil was the matter with his head?\n\n\"Damn!\" said Tommy, and tried to sit up. He had remembered. He was in\nthat sinister house in Soho. He uttered a groan and fell back. Through\nhis almost-closed lids he reconnoitred carefully.\n\n\"He is coming to,\" remarked a voice very near Tommy's ear. He recognized\nit at once for that of the bearded and efficient German, and lay\nartistically inert. He felt that it would be a pity to come round too\nsoon; and until the pain in his head became a little less acute, he felt\nquite incapable of collecting his wits. Painfully he tried to puzzle out\nwhat had happened. Obviously somebody must have crept up behind him as\nhe listened and struck him down with a blow on the head. They knew\nhim now for a spy, and would in all probability give him short shrift.\nUndoubtedly he was in a tight place. Nobody knew where he was, therefore\nhe need expect no outside assistance, and must depend solely on his own\nwits.\n\n\"Well, here goes,\" murmured Tommy to himself, and repeated his former\nremark.\n\n\"Damn!\" he observed, and this time succeeded in sitting up.\n\nIn a minute the German stepped forward and placed a glass to his lips,\nwith the brief command \"Drink.\" Tommy obeyed.", "The potency of the draught\nmade him choke, but it cleared his brain in a marvellous manner.\n\nHe was lying on a couch in the room in which the meeting had been held.\nOn one side of him was the German, on the other the villainous-faced\ndoorkeeper who had let him in. The others were grouped together at a\nlittle distance away. But Tommy missed one face. The man known as Number\nOne was no longer of the company.\n\n\"Feel better?\" asked the German, as he removed the empty glass.\n\n\"Yes, thanks,\" returned Tommy cheerfully.\n\n\"Ah, my young friend, it is lucky for you your skull is so thick. The\ngood Conrad struck hard.\" He indicated the evil-faced doorkeeper by a\nnod. The man grinned.\n\nTommy twisted his head round with an effort.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"so you're Conrad, are you? It strikes me the thickness\nof my skull was lucky for you too. When I look at you I feel it's almost\na pity I've enabled you to cheat the hangman.\"\n\nThe man snarled, and the bearded man said quietly:\n\n\"He would have run no risk of that.\"\n\n\"Just as you like,\" replied Tommy. \"I know it's the fashion to run down\nthe police. I rather believe in them myself.\"\n\nHis manner was nonchalant to the last degree. Tommy Beresford was one\nof those young Englishmen not distinguished by any special intellectual\nability, but who are emphatically at their best in what is known as a\n\"tight place.\" Their natural diffidence and caution fall from them like\na glove. Tommy realized perfectly that in his own wits lay the only\nchance of escape, and behind his casual manner he was racking his brains\nfuriously.\n\nThe cold accents of the German took up the conversation:\n\n\"Have you anything to say before you are put to death as a spy?\"\n\n\"Simply lots of things,\" replied Tommy with the same urbanity as before.\n\n\"Do you deny that you were listening at that door?\"\n\n\"I do not. I must really apologize--but your conversation was so\ninteresting that it overcame my scruples.\"", "\"How did you get in?\"\n\n\"Dear old Conrad here.\" Tommy smiled deprecatingly at him. \"I hesitate\nto suggest pensioning off a faithful servant, but you really ought to\nhave a better watchdog.\"\n\nConrad snarled impotently, and said sullenly, as the man with the beard\nswung round upon him:\n\n\"He gave the word. How was I to know?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Tommy chimed in. \"How was he to know? Don't blame the poor\nfellow. His hasty action has given me the pleasure of seeing you all\nface to face.\"\n\nHe fancied that his words caused some discomposure among the group, but\nthe watchful German stilled it with a wave of his hand.\n\n\"Dead men tell no tales,\" he said evenly.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Tommy, \"but I'm not dead yet!\"\n\n\"You soon will be, my young friend,\" said the German.\n\nAn assenting murmur came from the others.\n\nTommy's heart beat faster, but his casual pleasantness did not waver.\n\n\"I think not,\" he said firmly. \"I should have a great objection to\ndying.\"\n\nHe had got them puzzled, he saw that by the look on his captor's face.\n\n\"Can you give us any reason why we should not put you to death?\" asked\nthe German.\n\n\"Several,\" replied Tommy. \"Look here, you've been asking me a lot of\nquestions. Let me ask you one for a change. Why didn't you kill me off\nat once before I regained consciousness?\"\n\nThe German hesitated, and Tommy seized his advantage.\n\n\"Because you didn't know how much I knew--and where I obtained that\nknowledge. If you kill me now, you never will know.\"\n\nBut here the emotions of Boris became too much for him. He stepped\nforward waving his arms.\n\n\"You hell-hound of a spy,\" he screamed. \"We will give you short shrift.\nKill him! Kill him!\"\n\nThere was a roar of applause.\n\n\"You hear?\" said the German, his eyes on Tommy. \"What have you to say to\nthat?\"\n\n\"Say?\" Tommy shrugged his shoulders. \"Pack of fools. Let them ask\nthemselves a few questions. How did I get into this place? Remember what\ndear old Conrad said-- _with your own password_, wasn't it?", "How did I\nget hold of that? You don't suppose I came up those steps haphazard and\nsaid the first thing that came into my head?\"\n\nTommy was pleased with the concluding words of this speech. His only\nregret was that Tuppence was not present to appreciate its full flavour.\n\n\"That is true,\" said the working man suddenly. \"Comrades, we have been\nbetrayed!\"\n\nAn ugly murmur arose. Tommy smiled at them encouragingly.\n\n\"That's better. How can you hope to make a success of any job if you\ndon't use your brains?\"\n\n\"You will tell us who has betrayed us,\" said the German. \"But that shall\nnot save you--oh, no! You shall tell us all that you know. Boris, here,\nknows pretty ways of making people speak!\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said Tommy scornfully, fighting down a singularly unpleasant\nfeeling in the pit of his stomach. \"You will neither torture me nor kill\nme.\"\n\n\"And why not?\" asked Boris.\n\n\"Because you'd kill the goose that lays the golden eggs,\" replied Tommy\nquietly.\n\nThere was a momentary pause. It seemed as though Tommy's persistent\nassurance was at last conquering. They were no longer completely sure of\nthemselves. The man in the shabby clothes stared at Tommy searchingly.\n\n\"He's bluffing you, Boris,\" he said quietly.\n\nTommy hated him. Had the man seen through him?\n\nThe German, with an effort, turned roughly to Tommy.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"What do you think I mean?\" parried Tommy, searching desperately in his\nown mind.\n\nSuddenly Boris stepped forward, and shook his fist in Tommy's face.\n\n\"Speak, you swine of an Englishman--speak!\"\n\n\"Don't get so excited, my good fellow,\" said Tommy calmly. \"That's the\nworst of you foreigners. You can't keep calm. Now, I ask you, do I look\nas though I thought there were the least chance of your killing me?\"\n\nHe looked confidently round, and was glad they could not hear the\npersistent beating of his heart which gave the lie to his words.\n\n\"No,\" admitted Boris at last sullenly, \"you do not.\"\n\n\"Thank God, he's not a mind reader,\" thought Tommy. Aloud he pursued his\nadvantage:\n\n\"And why am I so confident?", "Because I know something that puts me in a\nposition to propose a bargain.\"\n\n\"A bargain?\" The bearded man took him up sharply.\n\n\"Yes--a bargain. My life and liberty against----\" He paused.\n\n\"Against what?\"\n\nThe group pressed forward. You could have heard a pin drop.\n\nSlowly Tommy spoke.\n\n\"The papers that Danvers brought over from America in the _Lusitania_.\"\n\nThe effect of his words was electrical. Every one was on his feet.\nThe German waved them back. He leaned over Tommy, his face purple with\nexcitement.\n\n\"_Himmel!_ You have got them, then?\"\n\nWith magnificent calm Tommy shook his head.\n\n\"You know where they are?\" persisted the German.\n\nAgain Tommy shook his head. \"Not in the least.\"\n\n\"Then--then----\" angry and baffled, the words failed him.\n\nTommy looked round. He saw anger and bewilderment on every face, but his\ncalm assurance had done its work--no one doubted but that something lay\nbehind his words.\n\n\"I don't know where the papers are--but I believe that I can find them.\nI have a theory----\"\n\n\"Pah!\"\n\nTommy raised his hand, and silenced the clamours of disgust.\n\n\"I call it a theory--but I'm pretty sure of my facts--facts that are\nknown to no one but myself. In any case what do you lose? If I can\nproduce the papers--you give me my life and liberty in exchange. Is it a\nbargain?\"\n\n\"And if we refuse?\" said the German quietly.\n\nTommy lay back on the couch.\n\n\"The 29th,\" he said thoughtfully, \"is less than a fortnight ahead----\"\n\nFor a moment the German hesitated. Then he made a sign to Conrad.\n\n\"Take him into the other room.\"\n\nFor five minutes, Tommy sat on the bed in the dingy room next door. His\nheart was beating violently. He had risked all on this throw. How would\nthey decide? And all the while that this agonized questioning went on\nwithin him, he talked flippantly to Conrad, enraging the cross-grained\ndoorkeeper to the point of homicidal mania.\n\nAt last the door opened, and the German called imperiously to Conrad to\nreturn.\n\n\"Let's hope the judge hasn't put his black cap on,\" remarked Tommy\nfrivolously.", "\"That's right, Conrad, march me in. The prisoner is at the\nbar, gentlemen.\"\n\nThe German was seated once more behind the table. He motioned to Tommy\nto sit down opposite to him.\n\n\"We accept,\" he said harshly, \"on terms. The papers must be delivered to\nus before you go free.\"\n\n\"Idiot!\" said Tommy amiably. \"How do you think I can look for them if\nyou keep me tied by the leg here?\"\n\n\"What do you expect, then?\"\n\n\"I must have liberty to go about the business in my own way.\"\n\nThe German laughed.\n\n\"Do you think we are little children to let you walk out of here leaving\nus a pretty story full of promises?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Tommy thoughtfully. \"Though infinitely simpler for me, I\ndid not really think you would agree to that plan. Very well, we must\narrange a compromise. How would it be if you attached little Conrad here\nto my person. He's a faithful fellow, and very ready with the fist.\"\n\n\"We prefer,\" said the German coldly, \"that you should remain here.\nOne of our number will carry out your instructions minutely. If the\noperations are complicated, he will return to you with a report and you\ncan instruct him further.\"\n\n\"You're tying my hands,\" complained Tommy. \"It's a very delicate affair,\nand the other fellow will muff it up as likely as not, and then where\nshall I be? I don't believe one of you has got an ounce of tact.\"\n\nThe German rapped the table.\n\n\"Those are our terms. Otherwise, death!\"\n\nTommy leaned back wearily.\n\n\"I like your style. Curt, but attractive. So be it, then. But one thing\nis essential, I must see the girl.\"\n\n\"What girl?\"\n\n\"Jane Finn, of course.\"\n\nThe other looked at him curiously for some minutes, then he said slowly,\nand as though choosing his words with care:\n\n\"Do you not know that she can tell you nothing?\"\n\nTommy's heart beat a little faster. Would he succeed in coming face to\nface with the girl he was seeking?\n\n\"I shall not ask her to tell me anything,\" he said quietly.", "\"Not in so\nmany words, that is.\"\n\n\"Then why see her?\"\n\nTommy paused.\n\n\"To watch her face when I ask her one question,\" he replied at last.\n\nAgain there was a look in the German's eyes that Tommy did not quite\nunderstand.\n\n\"She will not be able to answer your question.\"\n\n\"That does not matter. I shall have seen her face when I ask it.\"\n\n\"And you think that will tell you anything?\" He gave a short\ndisagreeable laugh. More than ever, Tommy felt that there was a\nfactor somewhere that he did not understand. The German looked at\nhim searchingly. \"I wonder whether, after all, you know as much as we\nthink?\" he said softly.\n\nTommy felt his ascendancy less sure than a moment before. His hold had\nslipped a little. But he was puzzled. What had he said wrong? He spoke\nout on the impulse of the moment.\n\n\"There may be things that you know which I do not. I have not pretended\nto be aware of all the details of your show. But equally I've got\nsomething up my sleeve that _you_ don't know about. And that's where I\nmean to score. Danvers was a damned clever fellow----\" He broke off as\nif he had said too much.\n\nBut the German's face had lightened a little.\n\n\"Danvers,\" he murmured. \"I see----\" He paused a minute, then waved to\nConrad. \"Take him away. Upstairs--you know.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" said Tommy. \"What about the girl?\"\n\n\"That may perhaps be arranged.\"\n\n\"It must be.\"\n\n\"We will see about it. Only one person can decide that.\"\n\n\"Who?\" asked Tommy. But he knew the answer.\n\n\"Mr. Brown----\"\n\n\"Shall I see him?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Conrad harshly.\n\nTommy rose obediently. Outside the door his gaoler motioned to him to\nmount the stairs. He himself followed close behind. On the floor above\nConrad opened a door and Tommy passed into a small room. Conrad lit a\nhissing gas burner and went out. Tommy heard the sound of the key being\nturned in the lock.\n\nHe set to work to examine his prison. It was a smaller room than the\none downstairs, and there was something peculiarly airless about the\natmosphere of it.", "Then he realized that there was no window. He walked\nround it. The walls were filthily dirty, as everywhere else. Four\npictures hung crookedly on the wall representing scenes from Faust.\nMarguerite with her box of jewels, the church scene, Siebel and his\nflowers, and Faust and Mephistopheles. The latter brought Tommy's mind\nback to Mr. Brown again. In this sealed and closed chamber, with its\nclose-fitting heavy door, he felt cut off from the world, and the\nsinister power of the arch-criminal seemed more real. Shout as he would,\nno one could ever hear him. The place was a living tomb....\n\nWith an effort Tommy pulled himself together. He sank on to the bed\nand gave himself up to reflection. His head ached badly; also, he was\nhungry. The silence of the place was dispiriting.\n\n\"Anyway,\" said Tommy, trying to cheer himself, \"I shall see the\nchief--the mysterious Mr. Brown and with a bit of luck in bluffing I\nshall see the mysterious Jane Finn also. After that----\"\n\nAfter that Tommy was forced to admit the prospect looked dreary.\n\nTHE troubles of the future, however, soon faded before the troubles of\nthe present. And of these, the most immediate and pressing was that of\nhunger. Tommy had a healthy and vigorous appetite. The steak and\nchips partaken of for lunch seemed now to belong to another decade. He\nregretfully recognized the fact that he would not make a success of a\nhunger strike.\n\nHe prowled aimlessly about his prison. Once or twice he discarded\ndignity, and pounded on the door. But nobody answered the summons.\n\n\"Hang it all!\" said Tommy indignantly. \"They can't mean to starve me\nto death.\" A new-born fear passed through his mind that this might,\nperhaps, be one of those \"pretty ways\" of making a prisoner speak, which\nhad been attributed to Boris. But on reflection he dismissed the idea.\n\n\"It's that sour-faced brute Conrad,\" he decided. \"That's a fellow I\nshall enjoy getting even with one of these days. This is just a bit of\nspite on his part.", "I'm certain of it.\"\n\nFurther meditations induced in him the feeling that it would be\nextremely pleasant to bring something down with a whack on Conrad's\negg-shaped head. Tommy stroked his own head tenderly, and gave himself\nup to the pleasures of imagination. Finally a bright idea flashed\nacross his brain. Why not convert imagination into reality? Conrad\nwas undoubtedly the tenant of the house. The others, with the possible\nexception of the bearded German, merely used it as a rendezvous.\nTherefore, why not wait in ambush for Conrad behind the door, and when\nhe entered bring down a chair, or one of the decrepit pictures, smartly\non to his head. One would, of course, be careful not to hit too hard.\nAnd then--and then, simply walk out! If he met anyone on the way down,\nwell---- Tommy brightened at the thought of an encounter with his fists.\nSuch an affair was infinitely more in his line than the verbal encounter\nof this afternoon. Intoxicated by his plan, Tommy gently unhooked the\npicture of the Devil and Faust, and settled himself in position. His\nhopes were high. The plan seemed to him simple but excellent.\n\nTime went on, but Conrad did not appear. Night and day were the same\nin this prison room, but Tommy's wrist-watch, which enjoyed a certain\ndegree of accuracy, informed him that it was nine o'clock in the\nevening. Tommy reflected gloomily that if supper did not arrive soon\nit would be a question of waiting for breakfast. At ten o'clock hope\ndeserted him, and he flung himself on the bed to seek consolation in\nsleep. In five minutes his woes were forgotten.\n\nThe sound of the key turning in the lock awoke him from his slumbers.\nNot belonging to the type of hero who is famous for awaking in full\npossession of his faculties, Tommy merely blinked at the ceiling and\nwondered vaguely where he was. Then he remembered, and looked at his\nwatch. It was eight o'clock.\n\n\"It's either early morning tea or breakfast,\" deduced the young man,\n\"and pray God it's the latter!\"", "The door swung open. Too late, Tommy remembered his scheme of\nobliterating the unprepossessing Conrad. A moment later he was glad that\nhe had, for it was not Conrad who entered, but a girl. She carried a\ntray which she set down on the table.\n\nIn the feeble light of the gas burner Tommy blinked at her. He decided\nat once that she was one of the most beautiful girls he had ever seen.\nHer hair was a full rich brown, with sudden glints of gold in it as\nthough there were imprisoned sunbeams struggling in its depths. There\nwas a wild-rose quality about her face. Her eyes, set wide apart, were\nhazel, a golden hazel that again recalled a memory of sunbeams.\n\nA delirious thought shot through Tommy's mind.\n\n\"Are you Jane Finn?\" he asked breathlessly.\n\nThe girl shook her head wonderingly.\n\n\"My name is Annette, monsieur.\"\n\nShe spoke in a soft, broken English.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tommy, rather taken aback. _\"Francaise?\"_ he hazarded.\n\n\"Oui, monsieur. Monsieur parle francais?\"\n\n\"Not for any length of time,\" said Tommy. \"What's that? Breakfast?\"\n\nThe girl nodded. Tommy dropped off the bed and came and inspected the\ncontents of the tray. It consisted of a loaf, some margarine, and a jug\nof coffee.\n\n\"The living is not equal to the _Ritz_,\" he observed with a sigh. \"But\nfor what we are at last about to receive the Lord has made me truly\nthankful. Amen.\"\n\nHe drew up a chair, and the girl turned away to the door.\n\n\"Wait a sec,\" cried Tommy. \"There are lots of things I want to ask you,\nAnnette. What are you doing in this house? Don't tell me you're Conrad's\nniece, or daughter, or anything, because I can't believe it.\"\n\n\"I do the _service_, monsieur. I am not related to anybody.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Tommy. \"You know what I asked you just now. Have you ever\nheard that name?\"\n\n\"I have heard people speak of Jane Finn, I think.\"\n\n\"You don't know where she is?\"\n\nAnnette shook her head.\n\n\"She's not in this house, for instance?\"\n\n\"Oh no, monsieur.", "I must go now--they will be waiting for me.\"\n\nShe hurried out. The key turned in the lock.\n\n\"I wonder who 'they' are,\" mused Tommy, as he continued to make inroads\non the loaf. \"With a bit of luck, that girl might help me to get out of\nhere. She doesn't look like one of the gang.\"\n\nAt one o'clock Annette reappeared with another tray, but this time\nConrad accompanied her.\n\n\"Good morning,\" said Tommy amiably. \"You have _not_ used Pear's soap, I\nsee.\"\n\nConrad growled threateningly.\n\n\"No light repartee, have you, old bean? There, there, we can't always\nhave brains as well as beauty. What have we for lunch? Stew? How did I\nknow? Elementary, my dear Watson--the smell of onions is unmistakable.\"\n\n\"Talk away,\" grunted the man. \"It's little enough time you'll have to\ntalk in, maybe.\"\n\nThe remark was unpleasant in its suggestion, but Tommy ignored it. He\nsat down at the table.\n\n\"Retire, varlet,\" he said, with a wave of his hand. \"Prate not to thy\nbetters.\"\n\nThat evening Tommy sat on the bed, and cogitated deeply. Would Conrad\nagain accompany the girl? If he did not, should he risk trying to make\nan ally of her? He decided that he must leave no stone unturned. His\nposition was desperate.\n\nAt eight o'clock the familiar sound of the key turning made him spring\nto his feet. The girl was alone.\n\n\"Shut the door,\" he commanded. \"I want to speak to you.\" She obeyed.\n\n\"Look here, Annette, I want you to help me get out of this.\" She shook\nher head.\n\n\"Impossible. There are three of them on the floor below.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Tommy was secretly grateful for the information. \"But you would\nhelp me if you could?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nThe girl hesitated.\n\n\"I think--they are my own people. You have spied upon them. They are\nquite right to keep you here.\"\n\n\"They're a bad lot, Annette. If you'll help me, I'll take you away from\nthe lot of them. And you'd probably get a good whack of money.\"\n\nBut the girl merely shook her head.", "\"I dare not, monsieur; I am afraid of them.\"\n\nShe turned away.\n\n\"Wouldn't you do anything to help another girl?\" cried Tommy. \"She's\nabout your age too. Won't you save her from their clutches?\"\n\n\"You mean Jane Finn?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It is her you came here to look for? Yes?\"\n\n\"That's it.\"\n\nThe girl looked at him, then passed her hand across her forehead.\n\n\"Jane Finn. Always I hear that name. It is familiar.\"\n\nTommy came forward eagerly.\n\n\"You must know _something_ about her?\"\n\nBut the girl turned away abruptly.\n\n\"I know nothing--only the name.\" She walked towards the door. Suddenly\nshe uttered a cry. Tommy stared. She had caught sight of the picture\nhe had laid against the wall the night before. For a moment he caught a\nlook of terror in her eyes. As inexplicably it changed to relief. Then\nabruptly she went out of the room. Tommy could make nothing of it. Did\nshe fancy that he had meant to attack her with it? Surely not. He rehung\nthe picture on the wall thoughtfully.\n\nThree more days went by in dreary inaction. Tommy felt the strain\ntelling on his nerves. He saw no one but Conrad and Annette, and the\ngirl had become dumb. She spoke only in monosyllables. A kind of dark\nsuspicion smouldered in her eyes. Tommy felt that if this solitary\nconfinement went on much longer he would go mad. He gathered from Conrad\nthat they were waiting for orders from \"Mr. Brown.\" Perhaps, thought\nTommy, he was abroad or away, and they were obliged to wait for his\nreturn.\n\nBut the evening of the third day brought a rude awakening.\n\nIt was barely seven o'clock when he heard the tramp of footsteps outside\nin the passage. In another minute the door was flung open. Conrad\nentered. With him was the evil-looking Number 14. Tommy's heart sank at\nthe sight of them.\n\n\"Evenin', gov'nor,\" said the man with a leer. \"Got those ropes, mate?\"\n\nThe silent Conrad produced a length of fine cord. The next minute Number\n14's hands, horribly dexterous, were winding the cord round his limbs,\nwhile Conrad held him down.", "\"What the devil----?\" began Tommy.\n\nBut the slow, speechless grin of the silent Conrad froze the words on\nhis lips.\n\nNumber 14 proceeded deftly with his task. In another minute Tommy was a\nmere helpless bundle. Then at last Conrad spoke:\n\n\"Thought you'd bluffed us, did you? With what you knew, and what you\ndidn't know. Bargained with us! And all the time it was bluff! Bluff!\nYou know less than a kitten. But your number's up now all right, you\nb---- swine.\"\n\nTommy lay silent. There was nothing to say. He had failed. Somehow\nor other the omnipotent Mr. Brown had seen through his pretensions.\nSuddenly a thought occurred to him.\n\n\"A very good speech, Conrad,\" he said approvingly. \"But wherefore the\nbonds and fetters? Why not let this kind gentleman here cut my throat\nwithout delay?\"\n\n\"Garn,\" said Number 14 unexpectedly. \"Think we're as green as to do you\nin here, and have the police nosing round? Not 'alf! We've ordered the\ncarriage for your lordship to-morrow mornin', but in the meantime we're\nnot taking any chances, see!\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Tommy, \"could be plainer than your words--unless it was\nyour face.\"\n\n\"Stow it,\" said Number 14.\n\n\"With pleasure,\" replied Tommy. \"You're making a sad mistake--but yours\nwill be the loss.\"\n\n\"You don't kid us that way again,\" said Number 14. \"Talking as though\nyou were still at the blooming _Ritz_, aren't you?\"\n\nTommy made no reply. He was engaged in wondering how Mr. Brown had\ndiscovered his identity. He decided that Tuppence, in the throes of\nanxiety, had gone to the police, and that his disappearance having been\nmade public the gang had not been slow to put two and two together.\n\nThe two men departed and the door slammed. Tommy was left to his\nmeditations. They were not pleasant ones. Already his limbs felt cramped\nand stiff. He was utterly helpless, and he could see no hope anywhere.\n\nAbout an hour had passed when he heard the key softly turned, and the\ndoor opened. It was Annette. Tommy's heart beat a little faster. He had\nforgotten the girl.", "Was it possible that she had come to his help?\n\nSuddenly he heard Conrad's voice:\n\n\"Come out of it, Annette. He doesn't want any supper to-night.\"\n\n\"Oui, oui, je sais bien. But I must take the other tray. We need the\nthings on it.\"\n\n\"Well, hurry up,\" growled Conrad.\n\nWithout looking at Tommy the girl went over to the table, and picked up\nthe tray. She raised a hand and turned out the light.\n\n\"Curse you\"--Conrad had come to the door--\"why did you do that?\"\n\n\"I always turn it out. You should have told me. Shall I relight it,\nMonsieur Conrad?\"\n\n\"No, come on out of it.\"\n\n\"Le beau petit monsieur,\" cried Annette, pausing by the bed in the\ndarkness. \"You have tied him up well, _hein?_ He is like a trussed\nchicken!\" The frank amusement in her tone jarred on the boy; but at\nthat moment, to his amazement, he felt her hand running lightly over\nhis bonds, and something small and cold was pressed into the palm of his\nhand.\n\n\"Come on, Annette.\"\n\n\"Mais me voila.\"\n\nThe door shut. Tommy heard Conrad say:\n\n\"Lock it and give me the key.\"\n\nThe footsteps died away. Tommy lay petrified with amazement. The object\nAnnette had thrust into his hand was a small penknife, the blade open.\nFrom the way she had studiously avoided looking at him, and her action\nwith the light, he came to the conclusion that the room was overlooked.\nThere must be a peep-hole somewhere in the walls. Remembering how\nguarded she had always been in her manner, he saw that he had probably\nbeen under observation all the time. Had he said anything to give\nhimself away? Hardly. He had revealed a wish to escape and a desire\nto find Jane Finn, but nothing that could have given a clue to his\nown identity. True, his question to Annette had proved that he was\npersonally unacquainted with Jane Finn, but he had never pretended\notherwise. The question now was, did Annette really know more? Were her\ndenials intended primarily for the listeners?", "On that point he could\ncome to no conclusion.\n\nBut there was a more vital question that drove out all others. Could he,\nbound as he was, manage to cut his bonds? He essayed cautiously to\nrub the open blade up and down on the cord that bound his two wrists\ntogether. It was an awkward business, and drew a smothered \"Ow\" of pain\nfrom him as the knife cut into his wrist. But slowly and doggedly he\nwent on sawing to and fro. He cut the flesh badly, but at last he felt\nthe cord slacken. With his hands free, the rest was easy. Five minutes\nlater he stood upright with some difficulty, owing to the cramp in his\nlimbs. His first care was to bind up his bleeding wrist. Then he sat on\nthe edge of the bed to think. Conrad had taken the key of the door, so\nhe could expect little more assistance from Annette. The only outlet\nfrom the room was the door, consequently he would perforce have to wait\nuntil the two men returned to fetch him. But when they did.... Tommy\nsmiled! Moving with infinite caution in the dark room, he found and\nunhooked the famous picture. He felt an economical pleasure that his\nfirst plan would not be wasted. There was now nothing to do but to wait.\nHe waited.\n\nThe night passed slowly. Tommy lived through an eternity of hours, but\nat last he heard footsteps. He stood upright, drew a deep breath, and\nclutched the picture firmly.\n\nThe door opened. A faint light streamed in from outside. Conrad went\nstraight towards the gas to light it. Tommy deeply regretted that it was\nhe who had entered first. It would have been pleasant to get even with\nConrad. Number 14 followed. As he stepped across the threshold, Tommy\nbrought the picture down with terrific force on his head. Number 14 went\ndown amidst a stupendous crash of broken glass. In a minute Tommy had\nslipped out and pulled to the door. The key was in the lock. He turned\nit and withdrew it just as Conrad hurled himself against the door from\nthe inside with a volley of curses.", "For a moment Tommy hesitated. There was the sound of some one stirring\non the floor below. Then the German's voice came up the stairs.\n\n\"Gott im Himmel! Conrad, what is it?\"\n\nTommy felt a small hand thrust into his. Beside him stood Annette. She\npointed up a rickety ladder that apparently led to some attics.\n\n\"Quick--up here!\" She dragged him after her up the ladder. In another\nmoment they were standing in a dusty garret littered with lumber. Tommy\nlooked round.\n\n\"This won't do. It's a regular trap. There's no way out.\"\n\n\"Hush! Wait.\" The girl put her finger to her lips. She crept to the top\nof the ladder and listened.\n\nThe banging and beating on the door was terrific. The German and another\nwere trying to force the door in. Annette explained in a whisper:\n\n\"They will think you are still inside. They cannot hear what Conrad\nsays. The door is too thick.\"\n\n\"I thought you could hear what went on in the room?\"\n\n\"There is a peep-hole into the next room. It was clever of you to guess.\nBut they will not think of that--they are only anxious to get in.\"\n\n\"Yes--but look here----\"\n\n\"Leave it to me.\" She bent down. To his amazement, Tommy saw that she\nwas fastening the end of a long piece of string to the handle of a big\ncracked jug. She arranged it carefully, then turned to Tommy.\n\n\"Have you the key of the door?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Give it to me.\"\n\nHe handed it to her.\n\n\"I am going down. Do you think you can go halfway, and then swing\nyourself down _behind_ the ladder, so that they will not see you?\"\n\nTommy nodded.\n\n\"There's a big cupboard in the shadow of the landing. Stand behind it.\nTake the end of this string in your hand. When I've let the others out--\n_pull! _\"\n\nBefore he had time to ask her anything more, she had flitted lightly\ndown the ladder and was in the midst of the group with a loud cry:\n\n\"Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Qu'est-ce qu'il y a?\"", "The German turned on her with an oath.\n\n\"Get out of this. Go to your room!\"\n\nVery cautiously Tommy swung himself down the back of the ladder. So\nlong as they did not turn round ... all was well. He crouched behind the\ncupboard. They were still between him and the stairs.\n\n\"Ah!\" Annette appeared to stumble over something. She stooped. \"Mon\nDieu, voila la clef!\"\n\nThe German snatched it from her. He unlocked the door. Conrad stumbled\nout, swearing.\n\n\"Where is he? Have you got him?\"\n\n\"We have seen no one,\" said the German sharply. His face paled. \"Who do\nyou mean?\"\n\nConrad gave vent to another oath.\n\n\"He's got away.\"\n\n\"Impossible. He would have passed us.\"\n\nAt that moment, with an ecstatic smile Tommy pulled the string. A crash\nof crockery came from the attic above. In a trice the men were pushing\neach other up the rickety ladder and had disappeared into the darkness\nabove.\n\nQuick as a flash Tommy leapt from his hiding-place and dashed down the\nstairs, pulling the girl with him. There was no one in the hall. He\nfumbled over the bolts and chain. At last they yielded, the door swung\nopen. He turned. Annette had disappeared.\n\nTommy stood spell-bound. Had she run upstairs again? What madness\npossessed her! He fumed with impatience, but he stood his ground. He\nwould not go without her.\n\nAnd suddenly there was an outcry overhead, an exclamation from the\nGerman, and then Annette's voice, clear and high:\n\n\"Ma foi, he has escaped! And quickly! Who would have thought it?\"\n\nTommy still stood rooted to the ground. Was that a command to him to go?\nHe fancied it was.\n\nAnd then, louder still, the words floated down to him:\n\n\"This is a terrible house. I want to go back to Marguerite. To\nMarguerite. _To Marguerite!_\"\n\nTommy had run back to the stairs. She wanted him to go and leave her.\nBut why? At all costs he must try and get her away with him. Then his\nheart sank. Conrad was leaping down the stairs, uttering a savage cry at\nthe sight of him.", "After him came the others.\n\nTommy stopped Conrad's rush with a straight blow with his fist. It\ncaught the other on the point of the jaw and he fell like a log. The\nsecond man tripped over his body and fell. From higher up the staircase\nthere was a flash, and a bullet grazed Tommy's ear. He realized that\nit would be good for his health to get out of this house as soon as\npossible. As regards Annette he could do nothing. He had got even with\nConrad, which was one satisfaction. The blow had been a good one.\n\nHe leapt for the door, slamming it behind him. The square was deserted.\nIn front of the house was a baker's van. Evidently he was to have been\ntaken out of London in that, and his body found many miles from the\nhouse in Soho. The driver jumped to the pavement and tried to bar\nTommy's way. Again Tommy's fist shot out, and the driver sprawled on the\npavement.\n\nTommy took to his heels and ran--none too soon. The front door opened\nand a hail of bullets followed him. Fortunately none of them hit him. He\nturned the corner of the square.\n\n\"There's one thing,\" he thought to himself, \"they can't go on shooting.\nThey'll have the police after them if they do. I wonder they dared to\nthere.\"\n\nHe heard the footsteps of his pursuers behind him, and redoubled his own\npace. Once he got out of these by-ways he would be safe. There would be\na policeman about somewhere--not that he really wanted to invoke the aid\nof the police if he could possibly do without it. It meant explanations,\nand general awkwardness. In another moment he had reason to bless his\nluck. He stumbled over a prostrate figure, which started up with a yell\nof alarm and dashed off down the street. Tommy drew back into a doorway.\nIn a minute he had the pleasure of seeing his two pursuers, of whom the\nGerman was one, industriously tracking down the red herring!\n\nTommy sat down quietly on the doorstep and allowed a few moments to\nelapse while he recovered his breath.", "Then he strolled gently in the\nopposite direction. He glanced at his watch. It was a little after\nhalf-past five. It was rapidly growing light. At the next corner he\npassed a policeman. The policeman cast a suspicious eye on him. Tommy\nfelt slightly offended. Then, passing his hand over his face, he\nlaughed. He had not shaved or washed for three days! What a guy he must\nlook.\n\nHe betook himself without more ado to a Turkish Bath establishment which\nhe knew to be open all night. He emerged into the busy daylight feeling\nhimself once more, and able to make plans.\n\nFirst of all, he must have a square meal. He had eaten nothing since\nmidday yesterday. He turned into an A.B.C. shop and ordered eggs and\nbacon and coffee. Whilst he ate, he read a morning paper propped up\nin front of him. Suddenly he stiffened. There was a long article on\nKramenin, who was described as the \"man behind Bolshevism\" in Russia,\nand who had just arrived in London--some thought as an unofficial envoy.\nHis career was sketched lightly, and it was firmly asserted that he,\nand not the figurehead leaders, had been the author of the Russian\nRevolution.\n\nIn the centre of the page was his portrait.\n\n\"So that's who Number 1 is,\" said Tommy with his mouth full of eggs and\nbacon. \"Not a doubt about it, I must push on.\"\n\nHe paid for his breakfast, and betook himself to Whitehall. There he\nsent up his name, and the message that it was urgent. A few minutes\nlater he was in the presence of the man who did not here go by the name\nof \"Mr. Carter.\" There was a frown on his face.\n\n\"Look here, you've no business to come asking for me in this way. I\nthought that was distinctly understood?\"\n\n\"It was, sir. But I judged it important to lose no time.\"\n\nAnd as briefly and succinctly as possible he detailed the experiences of\nthe last few days.\n\nHalf-way through, Mr. Carter interrupted him to give a few cryptic\norders through the telephone.", "All traces of displeasure had now left his\nface. He nodded energetically when Tommy had finished.\n\n\"Quite right. Every moment's of value. Fear we shall be too late anyway.\nThey wouldn't wait. Would clear out at once. Still, they may have left\nsomething behind them that will be a clue. You say you've recognized\nNumber 1 to be Kramenin? That's important. We want something against him\nbadly to prevent the Cabinet falling on his neck too freely. What about\nthe others? You say two faces were familiar to you? One's a Labour man,\nyou think? Just look through these photos, and see if you can spot him.\"\n\nA minute later, Tommy held one up. Mr. Carter exhibited some surprise.\n\n\"Ah, Westway! Shouldn't have thought it. Poses as being moderate. As for\nthe other fellow, I think I can give a good guess.\" He handed another\nphotograph to Tommy, and smiled at the other's exclamation. \"I'm right,\nthen. Who is he? Irishman. Prominent Unionist M.P. All a blind, of\ncourse. We've suspected it--but couldn't get any proof. Yes, you've done\nvery well, young man. The 29th, you say, is the date. That gives us very\nlittle time--very little time indeed.\"\n\n\"But----\" Tommy hesitated.\n\nMr. Carter read his thoughts.\n\n\"We can deal with the General Strike menace, I think. It's a\ntoss-up--but we've got a sporting chance! But if that draft treaty turns\nup--we're done. England will be plunged in anarchy. Ah, what's that?\nThe car? Come on, Beresford, we'll go and have a look at this house of\nyours.\"\n\nTwo constables were on duty in front of the house in Soho. An inspector\nreported to Mr. Carter in a low voice. The latter turned to Tommy.\n\n\"The birds have flown--as we thought. We might as well go over it.\"\n\nGoing over the deserted house seemed to Tommy to partake of the\ncharacter of a dream. Everything was just as it had been. The prison\nroom with the crooked pictures, the broken jug in the attic, the meeting\nroom with its long table. But nowhere was there a trace of papers.", "Everything of that kind had either been destroyed or taken away. And\nthere was no sign of Annette.\n\n\"What you tell me about the girl puzzled me,\" said Mr. Carter. \"You\nbelieve that she deliberately went back?\"\n\n\"It would seem so, sir. She ran upstairs while I was getting the door\nopen.\"\n\n\"H'm, she must belong to the gang, then; but, being a woman, didn't feel\nlike standing by to see a personable young man killed. But evidently\nshe's in with them, or she wouldn't have gone back.\"\n\n\"I can't believe she's really one of them, sir. She--seemed so\ndifferent----\"\n\n\"Good-looking, I suppose?\" said Mr. Carter with a smile that made Tommy\nflush to the roots of his hair. He admitted Annette's beauty rather\nshamefacedly.\n\n\"By the way,\" observed Mr. Carter, \"have you shown yourself to Miss\nTuppence yet? She's been bombarding me with letters about you.\"\n\n\"Tuppence? I was afraid she might get a bit rattled. Did she go to the\npolice?\"\n\nMr. Carter shook his head.\n\n\"Then I wonder how they twigged me.\"\n\nMr. Carter looked inquiringly at him, and Tommy explained. The other\nnodded thoughtfully.\n\n\"True, that's rather a curious point. Unless the mention of the _Ritz_\nwas an accidental remark?\"\n\n\"It might have been, sir. But they must have found out about me suddenly\nin some way.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Carter, looking round him, \"there's nothing more to be\ndone here. What about some lunch with me?\"\n\n\"Thanks awfully, sir. But I think I'd better get back and rout out\nTuppence.\"\n\n\"Of course. Give her my kind regards and tell her not to believe you're\nkilled too readily next time.\"\n\nTommy grinned.\n\n\"I take a lot of killing, sir.\"\n\n\"So I perceive,\" said Mr. Carter dryly. \"Well, good-bye. Remember you're\na marked man now, and take reasonable care of yourself.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\nHailing a taxi briskly Tommy stepped in, and was swiftly borne to the\n_Ritz_, dwelling the while on the pleasurable anticipation of startling\nTuppence.\n\n\"Wonder what she's been up to. Dogging 'Rita' most likely. By the way,\nI suppose that's who Annette meant by Marguerite.", "I didn't get it at the\ntime.\" The thought saddened him a little, for it seemed to prove that\nMrs. Vandemeyer and the girl were on intimate terms.\n\nThe taxi drew up at the _Ritz_. Tommy burst into its sacred portals\neagerly, but his enthusiasm received a check. He was informed that Miss\nCowley had gone out a quarter of an hour ago.\n\nBAFFLED for the moment, Tommy strolled into the restaurant, and ordered\na meal of surpassing excellence. His four days' imprisonment had taught\nhim anew to value good food.\n\nHe was in the middle of conveying a particularly choice morsel of Sole\na la Jeanette to his mouth, when he caught sight of Julius entering\nthe room. Tommy waved a menu cheerfully, and succeeded in attracting the\nother's attention. At the sight of Tommy, Julius's eyes seemed as though\nthey would pop out of his head. He strode across, and pump-handled\nTommy's hand with what seemed to the latter quite unnecessary vigour.\n\n\"Holy snakes!\" he ejaculated. \"Is it really you?\"\n\n\"Of course it is. Why shouldn't it be?\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't it be? Say, man, don't you know you've been given up\nfor dead? I guess we'd have had a solemn requiem for you in another few\ndays.\"\n\n\"Who thought I was dead?\" demanded Tommy.\n\n\"Tuppence.\"\n\n\"She remembered the proverb about the good dying young, I suppose. There\nmust be a certain amount of original sin in me to have survived. Where\nis Tuppence, by the way?\"\n\n\"Isn't she here?\"\n\n\"No, the fellows at the office said she'd just gone out.\"\n\n\"Gone shopping, I guess. I dropped her here in the car about an hour\nago. But, say, can't you shed that British calm of yours, and get down\nto it? What on God's earth have you been doing all this time?\"\n\n\"If you're feeding here,\" replied Tommy, \"order now. It's going to be a\nlong story.\"\n\nJulius drew up a chair to the opposite side of the table, summoned a\nhovering waiter, and dictated his wishes. Then he turned to Tommy.\n\n\"Fire ahead. I guess you've had some few adventures.\"", "\"One or two,\" replied Tommy modestly, and plunged into his recital.\n\nJulius listened spellbound. Half the dishes that were placed before him\nhe forgot to eat. At the end he heaved a long sigh.\n\n\"Bully for you. Reads like a dime novel!\"\n\n\"And now for the home front,\" said Tommy, stretching out his hand for a\npeach.\n\n\"We-el,\" drawled Julius, \"I don't mind admitting we've had some\nadventures too.\"\n\nHe, in his turn, assumed the role of narrator. Beginning with his\nunsuccessful reconnoitring at Bournemouth, he passed on to his return\nto London, the buying of the car, the growing anxieties of Tuppence,\nthe call upon Sir James, and the sensational occurrences of the previous\nnight.\n\n\"But who killed her?\" asked Tommy. \"I don't quite understand.\"\n\n\"The doctor kidded himself she took it herself,\" replied Julius dryly.\n\n\"And Sir James? What did he think?\"\n\n\"Being a legal luminary, he is likewise a human oyster,\" replied Julius.\n\"I should say he 'reserved judgment.'\" He went on to detail the events\nof the morning.\n\n\"Lost her memory, eh?\" said Tommy with interest. \"By Jove, that explains\nwhy they looked at me so queerly when I spoke of questioning her. Bit of\na slip on my part, that! But it wasn't the sort of thing a fellow would\nbe likely to guess.\"\n\n\"They didn't give you any sort of hint as to where Jane was?\"\n\nTommy shook his head regretfully.\n\n\"Not a word. I'm a bit of an ass, as you know. I ought to have got more\nout of them somehow.\"\n\n\"I guess you're lucky to be here at all. That bluff of yours was the\ngoods all right. How you ever came to think of it all so pat beats me to\na frazzle!\"\n\n\"I was in such a funk I had to think of something,\" said Tommy simply.\n\nThere was a moment's pause, and then Tommy reverted to Mrs. Vandemeyer's\ndeath.\n\n\"There's no doubt it was chloral?\"\n\n\"I believe not. At least they call it heart failure induced by an\noverdose, or some such claptrap. It's all right. We don't want to\nbe worried with an inquest.", "But I guess Tuppence and I and even the\nhighbrow Sir James have all got the same idea.\"\n\n\"Mr. Brown?\" hazarded Tommy.\n\n\"Sure thing.\"\n\nTommy nodded.\n\n\"All the same,\" he said thoughtfully, \"Mr. Brown hasn't got wings. I\ndon't see how he got in and out.\"\n\n\"How about some high-class thought transference stunt? Some magnetic\ninfluence that irresistibly impelled Mrs. Vandemeyer to commit suicide?\"\n\nTommy looked at him with respect.\n\n\"Good, Julius. Distinctly good. Especially the phraseology. But it\nleaves me cold. I yearn for a real Mr. Brown of flesh and blood. I think\nthe gifted young detectives must get to work, study the entrances and\nexits, and tap the bumps on their foreheads until the solution of the\nmystery dawns on them. Let's go round to the scene of the crime. I wish\nwe could get hold of Tuppence. The _Ritz_ would enjoy the spectacle of\nthe glad reunion.\"\n\nInquiry at the office revealed the fact that Tuppence had not yet\nreturned.\n\n\"All the same, I guess I'll have a look round upstairs,\" said Julius.\n\"She might be in my sitting-room.\" He disappeared.\n\nSuddenly a diminutive boy spoke at Tommy's elbow:\n\n\"The young lady--she's gone away by train, I think, sir,\" he murmured\nshyly.\n\n\"What?\" Tommy wheeled round upon him.\n\nThe small boy became pinker than before.\n\n\"The taxi, sir. I heard her tell the driver Charing Cross and to look\nsharp.\"\n\nTommy stared at him, his eyes opening wide in surprise. Emboldened, the\nsmall boy proceeded. \"So I thought, having asked for an A.B.C. and a\nBradshaw.\"\n\nTommy interrupted him:\n\n\"When did she ask for an A.B.C. and a Bradshaw?\"\n\n\"When I took her the telegram, sir.\"\n\n\"A telegram?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"When was that?\"\n\n\"About half-past twelve, sir.\"\n\n\"Tell me exactly what happened.\"\n\nThe small boy drew a long breath.\n\n\"I took up a telegram to No. 891--the lady was there. She opened it\nand gave a gasp, and then she said, very jolly like: 'Bring me up a\nBradshaw, and an A.B.C., and look sharp, Henry.'", "My name isn't Henry,\nbut----\"\n\n\"Never mind your name,\" said Tommy impatiently. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I brought them, and she told me to wait, and looked up\nsomething. And then she looks up at the clock, and 'Hurry up,' she says.\n'Tell them to get me a taxi,' and she begins a-shoving on of her hat in\nfront of the glass, and she was down in two ticks, almost as quick as I\nwas, and I seed her going down the steps and into the taxi, and I heard\nher call out what I told you.\"\n\nThe small boy stopped and replenished his lungs. Tommy continued to\nstare at him. At that moment Julius rejoined him. He held an open letter\nin his hand.\n\n\"I say, Hersheimmer\"--Tommy turned to him--\"Tuppence has gone off\nsleuthing on her own.\"\n\n\"Shucks!\"\n\n\"Yes, she has. She went off in a taxi to Charing Cross in the deuce of a\nhurry after getting a telegram.\" His eye fell on the letter in Julius's\nhand. \"Oh; she left a note for you. That's all right. Where's she off\nto?\"\n\nAlmost unconsciously, he held out his hand for the letter, but\nJulius folded it up and placed it in his pocket. He seemed a trifle\nembarrassed.\n\n\"I guess this is nothing to do with it. It's about something\nelse--something I asked her that she was to let me know about.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Tommy looked puzzled, and seemed waiting for more.\n\n\"See here,\" said Julius suddenly, \"I'd better put you wise. I asked Miss\nTuppence to marry me this morning.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tommy mechanically. He felt dazed. Julius's words were\ntotally unexpected. For the moment they benumbed his brain.\n\n\"I'd like to tell you,\" continued Julius, \"that before I suggested\nanything of the kind to Miss Tuppence, I made it clear that I didn't\nwant to butt in in any way between her and you----\"\n\nTommy roused himself.\n\n\"That's all right,\" he said quickly. \"Tuppence and I have been pals for\nyears. Nothing more.\" He lit a cigarette with a hand that shook ever\nso little.", "\"That's quite all right. Tuppence always said that she was\nlooking out for----\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly, his face crimsoning, but Julius was in no way\ndiscomposed.\n\n\"Oh, I guess it'll be the dollars that'll do the trick. Miss Tuppence\nput me wise to that right away. There's no humbug about her. We ought to\ngee along together very well.\"\n\nTommy looked at him curiously for a minute, as though he were about\nto speak, then changed his mind and said nothing. Tuppence and Julius!\nWell, why not? Had she not lamented the fact that she knew no rich men?\nHad she not openly avowed her intention of marrying for money if she\never had the chance? Her meeting with the young American millionaire\nhad given her the chance--and it was unlikely she would be slow to avail\nherself of it. She was out for money. She had always said so. Why blame\nher because she had been true to her creed?\n\nNevertheless, Tommy did blame her. He was filled with a passionate and\nutterly illogical resentment. It was all very well to _say_ things\nlike that--but a _real_ girl would never marry for money. Tuppence was\nutterly cold-blooded and selfish, and he would be delighted if he never\nsaw her again! And it was a rotten world!\n\nJulius's voice broke in on these meditations.\n\n\"Yes, we ought to gee along together very well. I've heard that a girl\nalways refuses you once--a sort of convention.\"\n\nTommy caught his arm.\n\n\"Refuses? Did you say _refuses?_\"\n\n\"Sure thing. Didn't I tell you that? She just rapped out a 'no' without\nany kind of reason to it. The eternal feminine, the Huns call it, I've\nheard. But she'll come round right enough. Likely enough, I hustled her\nsome----\"\n\nBut Tommy interrupted regardless of decorum.\n\n\"What did she say in that note?\" he demanded fiercely.\n\nThe obliging Julius handed it to him.\n\n\"There's no earthly clue in it as to where she's gone,\" he assured\nTommy. \"But you might as well see for yourself if you don't believe me.\"\n\nThe note, in Tuppence's well-known schoolboy writing, ran as follows:\n\n\"DEAR JULIUS,\n\n\"It's always better to have things in black and white.", "I don't feel I\ncan be bothered to think of marriage until Tommy is found. Let's leave\nit till then.\n\n\"Yours affectionately,\n\n\"TUPPENCE.\"\n\nTommy handed it back, his eyes shining. His feelings had undergone a\nsharp reaction. He now felt that Tuppence was all that was noble and\ndisinterested. Had she not refused Julius without hesitation? True, the\nnote betokened signs of weakening, but he could excuse that. It read\nalmost like a bribe to Julius to spur him on in his efforts to find\nTommy, but he supposed she had not really meant it that way. Darling\nTuppence, there was not a girl in the world to touch her! When he saw\nher----His thoughts were brought up with a sudden jerk.\n\n\"As you say,\" he remarked, pulling himself together, \"there's not a hint\nhere as to what she's up to. Hi--Henry!\"\n\nThe small boy came obediently. Tommy produced five shillings.\n\n\"One thing more. Do you remember what the young lady did with the\ntelegram?\"\n\nHenry gasped and spoke.\n\n\"She crumpled it up into a ball and threw it into the grate, and made a\nsort of noise like 'Whoop!' sir.\"\n\n\"Very graphic, Henry,\" said Tommy. \"Here's your five shillings. Come on,\nJulius. We must find that telegram.\"\n\nThey hurried upstairs. Tuppence had left the key in her door. The room\nwas as she had left it. In the fireplace was a crumpled ball of orange\nand white. Tommy disentangled it and smoothed out the telegram.\n\n\"Come at once, Moat House, Ebury, Yorkshire, great developments--TOMMY.\"\n\nThey looked at each other in stupefaction. Julius spoke first:\n\n\"You didn't send it?\"\n\n\"Of course not. What does it mean?\"\n\n\"I guess it means the worst,\" said Julius quietly. \"They've got her.\"\n\n_\"What?\"_\n\n\"Sure thing! They signed your name, and she fell into the trap like a\nlamb.\"\n\n\"My God! What shall we do?\"\n\n\"Get busy, and go after her! Right now! There's no time to waste. It's\nalmighty luck that she didn't take the wire with her. If she had we'd\nprobably never have traced her. But we've got to hustle.", "Where's that\nBradshaw?\"\n\nThe energy of Julius was infectious. Left to himself, Tommy would\nprobably have sat down to think things out for a good half-hour before\nhe decided on a plan of action. But with Julius Hersheimmer about,\nhustling was inevitable.\n\nAfter a few muttered imprecations he handed the Bradshaw to Tommy as\nbeing more conversant with its mysteries. Tommy abandoned it in favour\nof an A.B.C.\n\n\"Here we are. Ebury, Yorks. From King's Cross. Or St. Pancras. (Boy must\nhave made a mistake. It was King's Cross, not _Charing_ Cross.) 12.50,\nthat's the train she went by. 2.10, that's gone. 3.20 is the next--and a\ndamned slow train too.\"\n\n\"What about the car?\"\n\nTommy shook his head.\n\n\"Send it up if you like, but we'd better stick to the train. The great\nthing is to keep calm.\"\n\nJulius groaned.\n\n\"That's so. But it gets my goat to think of that innocent young girl in\ndanger!\"\n\nTommy nodded abstractedly. He was thinking. In a moment or two, he said:\n\n\"I say, Julius, what do they want her for, anyway?\"\n\n\"Eh? I don't get you?\"\n\n\"What I mean is that I don't think it's their game to do her any harm,\"\n explained Tommy, puckering his brow with the strain of his mental\nprocesses. \"She's a hostage, that's what she is. She's in no immediate\ndanger, because if we tumble on to anything, she'd be damned useful to\nthem. As long as they've got her, they've got the whip hand of us. See?\"\n\n\"Sure thing,\" said Julius thoughtfully. \"That's so.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" added Tommy, as an afterthought, \"I've great faith in\nTuppence.\"\n\nThe journey was wearisome, with many stops, and crowded carriages. They\nhad to change twice, once at Doncaster, once at a small junction. Ebury\nwas a deserted station with a solitary porter, to whom Tommy addressed\nhimself:\n\n\"Can you tell me the way to the Moat House?\"\n\n\"The Moat House? It's a tidy step from here. The big house near the sea,\nyou mean?\"\n\nTommy assented brazenly. After listening to the porter's meticulous\nbut perplexing directions, they prepared to leave the station.", "It was\nbeginning to rain, and they turned up the collars of their coats as they\ntrudged through the slush of the road. Suddenly Tommy halted.\n\n\"Wait a moment.\" He ran back to the station and tackled the porter anew.\n\n\"Look here, do you remember a young lady who arrived by an earlier\ntrain, the 12.50 from London? She'd probably ask you the way to the Moat\nHouse.\"\n\nHe described Tuppence as well as he could, but the porter shook his\nhead. Several people had arrived by the train in question. He could not\ncall to mind one young lady in particular. But he was quite certain that\nno one had asked him the way to the Moat House.\n\nTommy rejoined Julius, and explained. Depression was settling on him\nlike a leaden weight. He felt convinced that their quest was going to\nbe unsuccessful. The enemy had over three hours' start. Three hours was\nmore than enough for Mr. Brown. He would not ignore the possibility of\nthe telegram having been found.\n\nThe way seemed endless. Once they took the wrong turning and went nearly\nhalf a mile out of their direction. It was past seven o'clock when a\nsmall boy told them that \"t' Moat House\" was just past the next corner.\n\nA rusty iron gate swinging dismally on its hinges! An overgrown drive\nthick with leaves. There was something about the place that struck a\nchill to both their hearts. They went up the deserted drive. The leaves\ndeadened their footsteps. The daylight was almost gone. It was like\nwalking in a world of ghosts. Overhead the branches flapped and creaked\nwith a mournful note. Occasionally a sodden leaf drifted silently down,\nstartling them with its cold touch on their cheek.\n\nA turn of the drive brought them in sight of the house. That, too,\nseemed empty and deserted. The shutters were closed, the steps up to\nthe door overgrown with moss. Was it indeed to this desolate spot\nthat Tuppence had been decoyed? It seemed hard to believe that a human\nfootstep had passed this way for months.", "Julius jerked the rusty bell handle. A jangling peal rang discordantly,\nechoing through the emptiness within. No one came. They rang again and\nagain--but there was no sign of life. Then they walked completely round\nthe house. Everywhere silence, and shuttered windows. If they could\nbelieve the evidence of their eyes the place was empty.\n\n\"Nothing doing,\" said Julius.\n\nThey retraced their steps slowly to the gate.\n\n\"There must be a village handy,\" continued the young American. \"We'd\nbetter make inquiries there. They'll know something about the place, and\nwhether there's been anyone there lately.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's not a bad idea.\"\n\nProceeding up the road, they soon came to a little hamlet. On the\noutskirts of it, they met a workman swinging his bag of tools, and Tommy\nstopped him with a question.\n\n\"The Moat House? It's empty. Been empty for years. Mrs. Sweeny's got the\nkey if you want to go over it--next to the post office.\"\n\nTommy thanked him. They soon found the post office, which was also a\nsweet and general fancy shop, and knocked at the door of the cottage\nnext to it. A clean, wholesome-looking woman opened it. She readily\nproduced the key of the Moat House.\n\n\"Though I doubt if it's the kind of place to suit you, sir. In a\nterrible state of repair. Ceilings leaking and all. 'Twould need a lot\nof money spent on it.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Tommy cheerily. \"I dare say it'll be a washout, but\nhouses are scarce nowadays.\"\n\n\"That they are,\" declared the woman heartily. \"My daughter and\nson-in-law have been looking for a decent cottage for I don't know how\nlong. It's all the war. Upset things terribly, it has. But excuse me,\nsir, it'll be too dark for you to see much of the house. Hadn't you\nbetter wait until to-morrow?\"\n\n\"That's all right. We'll have a look around this evening, anyway. We'd\nhave been here before only we lost our way. What's the best place to\nstay at for the night round here?\"\n\nMrs. Sweeny looked doubtful.\n\n\"There's the _Yorkshire Arms_, but it's not much of a place for\ngentlemen like you.\"", "\"Oh, it will do very well. Thanks. By the way, you've not had a young\nlady here asking for this key to-day?\"\n\nThe woman shook her head.\n\n\"No one's been over the place for a long time.\"\n\n\"Thanks very much.\"\n\nThey retraced their steps to the Moat House. As the front door swung\nback on its hinges, protesting loudly, Julius struck a match and\nexamined the floor carefully. Then he shook his head.\n\n\"I'd swear no one's passed this way. Look at the dust. Thick. Not a sign\nof a footmark.\"\n\nThey wandered round the deserted house. Everywhere the same tale. Thick\nlayers of dust apparently undisturbed.\n\n\"This gets me,\" said Julius. \"I don't believe Tuppence was ever in this\nhouse.\"\n\n\"She must have been.\"\n\nJulius shook his head without replying.\n\n\"We'll go over it again to-morrow,\" said Tommy. \"Perhaps we'll see more\nin the daylight.\"\n\nOn the morrow they took up the search once more, and were reluctantly\nforced to the conclusion that the house had not been invaded for some\nconsiderable time. They might have left the village altogether but for\na fortunate discovery of Tommy's. As they were retracing their steps to\nthe gate, he gave a sudden cry, and stooping, picked something up from\namong the leaves, and held it out to Julius. It was a small gold brooch.\n\n\"That's Tuppence's!\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. I've often seen her wear it.\"\n\nJulius drew a deep breath.\n\n\"I guess that settles it. She came as far as here, anyway. We'll make\nthat pub our head-quarters, and raise hell round here until we find her.\nSomebody _must_ have seen her.\"\n\nForthwith the campaign began. Tommy and Julius worked separately and\ntogether, but the result was the same. Nobody answering to Tuppence's\ndescription had been seen in the vicinity. They were baffled--but not\ndiscouraged. Finally they altered their tactics. Tuppence had certainly\nnot remained long in the neighbourhood of the Moat House. That pointed\nto her having been overcome and carried away in a car. They renewed\ninquiries. Had anyone seen a car standing somewhere near the Moat House\nthat day?", "Again they met with no success.\n\nJulius wired to town for his own car, and they scoured the neighbourhood\ndaily with unflagging zeal. A grey limousine on which they had set high\nhopes was traced to Harrogate, and turned out to be the property of a\nhighly respectable maiden lady!\n\nEach day saw them set out on a new quest. Julius was like a hound on\nthe leash. He followed up the slenderest clue. Every car that had passed\nthrough the village on the fateful day was tracked down. He forced his\nway into country properties and submitted the owners of the motors to\na searching cross-examination. His apologies were as thorough as his\nmethods, and seldom failed in disarming the indignation of his victims;\nbut, as day succeeded day, they were no nearer to discovering Tuppence's\nwhereabouts. So well had the abduction been planned that the girl seemed\nliterally to have vanished into thin air.\n\nAnd another preoccupation was weighing on Tommy's mind.\n\n\"Do you know how long we've been here?\" he asked one morning as they\nsat facing each other at breakfast. \"A week! We're no nearer to finding\nTuppence, _and next Sunday is the_ 29_th!_\"\n\n\"Shucks!\" said Julius thoughtfully. \"I'd almost forgotten about the\n29th. I've been thinking of nothing but Tuppence.\"\n\n\"So have I. At least, I hadn't forgotten about the 29th, but it didn't\nseem to matter a damn in comparison to finding Tuppence. But to-day's\nthe 23rd, and time's getting short. If we're ever going to get hold of\nher at all, we must do it before the 29th--her life won't be worth an\nhour's purchase afterwards. The hostage game will be played out by then.\nI'm beginning to feel that we've made a big mistake in the way we've set\nabout this. We've wasted time and we're no forrader.\"\n\n\"I'm with you there. We've been a couple of mutts, who've bitten off a\nbigger bit than they can chew. I'm going to quit fooling right away!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you. I'm going to do what we ought to have done a week ago.", "I'm going right back to London to put the case in the hands of your\nBritish police. We fancied ourselves as sleuths. Sleuths! It was a piece\nof damn-fool foolishness! I'm through! I've had enough of it. Scotland\nYard for me!\"\n\n\"You're right,\" said Tommy slowly. \"I wish to God we'd gone there right\naway.\"\n\n\"Better late than never. We've been like a couple of babes playing 'Here\nwe go round the Mulberry Bush.' Now I'm going right along to Scotland\nYard to ask them to take me by the hand and show me the way I should go.\nI guess the professional always scores over the amateur in the end. Are\nyou coming along with me?\"\n\nTommy shook his head.\n\n\"What's the good? One of us is enough. I might as well stay here and\nnose round a bit longer. Something _might_ turn up. One never knows.\"\n\n\"Sure thing. Well, so long. I'll be back in a couple of shakes with a\nfew inspectors along. I shall tell them to pick out their brightest and\nbest.\"\n\nBut the course of events was not to follow the plan Julius had laid\ndown. Later in the day Tommy received a wire:\n\n\"Join me Manchester Midland Hotel. Important news--JULIUS.\"\n\nAt 7.30 that night Tommy alighted from a slow cross-country train.\nJulius was on the platform.\n\n\"Thought you'd come by this train if you weren't out when my wire\narrived.\"\n\nTommy grasped him by the arm.\n\n\"What is it? Is Tuppence found?\"\n\nJulius shook his head.\n\n\"No. But I found this waiting in London. Just arrived.\"\n\nHe handed the telegraph form to the other. Tommy's eyes opened as he\nread:\n\n\"Jane Finn found. Come Manchester Midland Hotel immediately--PEEL\nEDGERTON.\"\n\nJulius took the form back and folded it up.\n\n\"Queer,\" he said thoughtfully. \"I thought that lawyer chap had quit!\"\n\n\"MY train got in half an hour ago,\" explained Julius, as he led the way\nout of the station. \"I reckoned you'd come by this before I left London,\nand wired accordingly to Sir James. He's booked rooms for us, and will\nbe round to dine at eight.\"", "\"What made you think he'd ceased to take any interest in the case?\"\n asked Tommy curiously.\n\n\"What he said,\" replied Julius dryly. \"The old bird's as close as an\noyster! Like all the darned lot of them, he wasn't going to commit\nhimself till he was sure he could deliver the goods.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Tommy thoughtfully.\n\nJulius turned on him.\n\n\"You wonder what?\"\n\n\"Whether that was his real reason.\"\n\n\"Sure. You bet your life it was.\"\n\nTommy shook his head unconvinced.\n\nSir James arrived punctually at eight o'clock, and Julius introduced\nTommy. Sir James shook hands with him warmly.\n\n\"I am delighted to make your acquaintance, Mr. Beresford. I have heard\nso much about you from Miss Tuppence\"--he smiled involuntarily--\"that it\nreally seems as though I already know you quite well.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Tommy with his cheerful grin. He scanned the\ngreat lawyer eagerly. Like Tuppence, he felt the magnetism of the\nother's personality. He was reminded of Mr. Carter. The two men, totally\nunlike so far as physical resemblance went, produced a similar effect.\nBeneath the weary manner of the one and the professional reserve of the\nother, lay the same quality of mind, keen-edged like a rapier.\n\nIn the meantime he was conscious of Sir James's close scrutiny. When the\nlawyer dropped his eyes the young man had the feeling that the other had\nread him through and through like an open book. He could not but wonder\nwhat the final judgment was, but there was little chance of learning\nthat. Sir James took in everything, but gave out only what he chose. A\nproof of that occurred almost at once.\n\nImmediately the first greetings were over Julius broke out into a flood\nof eager questions. How had Sir James managed to track the girl? Why had\nhe not let them know that he was still working on the case? And so on.\n\nSir James stroked his chin and smiled. At last he said:\n\n\"Just so, just so. Well, she's found. And that's the great thing, isn't\nit? Eh! Come now, that's the great thing?\"", "\"Sure it is. But just how did you strike her trail? Miss Tuppence and I\nthought you'd quit for good and all.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" The lawyer shot a lightning glance at him, then resumed operations\non his chin. \"You thought that, did you? Did you really? H'm, dear me.\"\n\n\"But I guess I can take it we were wrong,\" pursued Julius.\n\n\"Well, I don't know that I should go so far as to say that. But it's\ncertainly fortunate for all parties that we've managed to find the young\nlady.\"\n\n\"But where is she?\" demanded Julius, his thoughts flying off on another\ntack. \"I thought you'd be sure to bring her along?\"\n\n\"That would hardly be possible,\" said Sir James gravely.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because the young lady was knocked down in a street accident, and has\nsustained slight injuries to the head. She was taken to the infirmary,\nand on recovering consciousness gave her name as Jane Finn. When--ah!--I\nheard that, I arranged for her to be removed to the house of a\ndoctor--a friend of mine, and wired at once for you. She relapsed into\nunconsciousness and has not spoken since.\"\n\n\"She's not seriously hurt?\"\n\n\"Oh, a bruise and a cut or two; really, from a medical point of view,\nabsurdly slight injuries to have produced such a condition. Her state is\nprobably to be attributed to the mental shock consequent on recovering\nher memory.\"\n\n\"It's come back?\" cried Julius excitedly.\n\nSir James tapped the table rather impatiently.\n\n\"Undoubtedly, Mr. Hersheimmer, since she was able to give her real name.\nI thought you had appreciated that point.\"\n\n\"And you just happened to be on the spot,\" said Tommy. \"Seems quite like\na fairy tale.\"\n\nBut Sir James was far too wary to be drawn.\n\n\"Coincidences are curious things,\" he said dryly.\n\nNevertheless Tommy was now certain of what he had before only suspected.\nSir James's presence in Manchester was not accidental. Far from\nabandoning the case, as Julius supposed, he had by some means of his own\nsuccessfully run the missing girl to earth. The only thing that puzzled\nTommy was the reason for all this secrecy.", "He concluded that it was a\nfoible of the legal mind.\n\nJulius was speaking.\n\n\"After dinner,\" he announced, \"I shall go right away and see Jane.\"\n\n\"That will be impossible, I fear,\" said Sir James. \"It is very unlikely\nthey would allow her to see visitors at this time of night. I should\nsuggest to-morrow morning about ten o'clock.\"\n\nJulius flushed. There was something in Sir James which always stirred\nhim to antagonism. It was a conflict of two masterful personalities.\n\n\"All the same, I reckon I'll go round there to-night and see if I can't\nginger them up to break through their silly rules.\"\n\n\"It will be quite useless, Mr. Hersheimmer.\"\n\nThe words came out like the crack of a pistol, and Tommy looked up with\na start. Julius was nervous and excited. The hand with which he raised\nhis glass to his lips shook slightly, but his eyes held Sir James's\ndefiantly. For a moment the hostility between the two seemed likely to\nburst into flame, but in the end Julius lowered his eyes, defeated.\n\n\"For the moment, I reckon you're the boss.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the other. \"We will say ten o'clock then?\" With\nconsummate ease of manner he turned to Tommy. \"I must confess, Mr.\nBeresford, that it was something of a surprise to me to see you here\nthis evening. The last I heard of you was that your friends were in\ngrave anxiety on your behalf. Nothing had been heard of you for\nsome days, and Miss Tuppence was inclined to think you had got into\ndifficulties.\"\n\n\"I had, sir!\" Tommy grinned reminiscently. \"I was never in a tighter\nplace in my life.\"\n\nHelped out by questions from Sir James, he gave an abbreviated account\nof his adventures. The lawyer looked at him with renewed interest as he\nbrought the tale to a close.\n\n\"You got yourself out of a tight place very well,\" he said gravely. \"I\ncongratulate you. You displayed a great deal of ingenuity and carried\nyour part through well.\"\n\nTommy blushed, his face assuming a prawnlike hue at the praise.", "\"I couldn't have got away but for the girl, sir.\"\n\n\"No.\" Sir James smiled a little. \"It was lucky for you she happened\nto--er--take a fancy to you.\" Tommy appeared about to protest, but Sir\nJames went on. \"There's no doubt about her being one of the gang, I\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not, sir. I thought perhaps they were keeping her there by\nforce, but the way she acted didn't fit in with that. You see, she went\nback to them when she could have got away.\"\n\nSir James nodded thoughtfully.\n\n\"What did she say? Something about wanting to be taken to Marguerite?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I suppose she meant Mrs. Vandemeyer.\"\n\n\"She always signed herself Rita Vandemeyer. All her friends spoke of\nher as Rita. Still, I suppose the girl must have been in the habit of\ncalling her by her full name. And, at the moment she was crying out to\nher, Mrs. Vandemeyer was either dead or dying! Curious! There are one\nor two points that strike me as being obscure--their sudden change\nof attitude towards yourself, for instance. By the way, the house was\nraided, of course?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, but they'd all cleared out.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Sir James dryly.\n\n\"And not a clue left behind.\"\n\n\"I wonder----\" The lawyer tapped the table thoughtfully.\n\nSomething in his voice made Tommy look up. Would this man's eyes have\nseen something where theirs had been blind? He spoke impulsively:\n\n\"I wish you'd been there, sir, to go over the house!\"\n\n\"I wish I had,\" said Sir James quietly. He sat for a moment in silence.\nThen he looked up. \"And since then? What have you been doing?\"\n\nFor a moment, Tommy stared at him. Then it dawned on him that of course\nthe lawyer did not know.\n\n\"I forgot that you didn't know about Tuppence,\" he said slowly. The\nsickening anxiety, forgotten for a while in the excitement of knowing\nJane Finn was found at last, swept over him again.\n\nThe lawyer laid down his knife and fork sharply.\n\n\"Has anything happened to Miss Tuppence?\" His voice was keen-edged.", "\"She's disappeared,\" said Julius.\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"A week ago.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\nSir James's questions fairly shot out. Between them Tommy and Julius\ngave the history of the last week and their futile search.\n\nSir James went at once to the root of the matter.\n\n\"A wire signed with your name? They knew enough of you both for that.\nThey weren't sure of how much you had learnt in that house. Their\nkidnapping of Miss Tuppence is the counter-move to your escape. If\nnecessary they could seal your lips with a threat of what might happen\nto her.\"\n\nTommy nodded.\n\n\"That's just what I thought, sir.\"\n\nSir James looked at him keenly. \"You had worked that out, had you? Not\nbad--not at all bad. The curious thing is that they certainly did not\nknow anything about you when they first held you prisoner. You are sure\nthat you did not in any way disclose your identity?\"\n\nTommy shook his head.\n\n\"That's so,\" said Julius with a nod. \"Therefore I reckon some one put\nthem wise--and not earlier than Sunday afternoon.\"\n\n\"Yes, but who?\"\n\n\"That almighty omniscient Mr. Brown, of course!\"\n\nThere was a faint note of derision in the American's voice which made\nSir James look up sharply.\n\n\"You don't believe in Mr. Brown, Mr. Hersheimmer?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I do not,\" returned the young American with emphasis. \"Not\nas such, that is to say. I reckon it out that he's a figurehead--just a\nbogy name to frighten the children with. The real head of this business\nis that Russian chap Kramenin. I guess he's quite capable of running\nrevolutions in three countries at once if he chose! The man Whittington\nis probably the head of the English branch.\"\n\n\"I disagree with you,\" said Sir James shortly. \"Mr. Brown exists.\" He\nturned to Tommy. \"Did you happen to notice where that wire was handed\nin?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I'm afraid I didn't.\"\n\n\"H'm. Got it with you?\"\n\n\"It's upstairs, sir, in my kit.\"\n\n\"I'd like to have a look at it sometime. No hurry. You've wasted a\nweek\"--Tommy hung his head--\"a day or so more is immaterial.", "We'll deal\nwith Miss Jane Finn first. Afterwards, we'll set to work to rescue Miss\nTuppence from bondage. I don't think she's in any immediate danger. That\nis, so long as they don't know that we've got Jane Finn, and that\nher memory has returned. We must keep that dark at all costs. You\nunderstand?\"\n\nThe other two assented, and, after making arrangements for meeting on\nthe morrow, the great lawyer took his leave.\n\nAt ten o'clock, the two young men were at the appointed spot. Sir\nJames had joined them on the doorstep. He alone appeared unexcited. He\nintroduced them to the doctor.\n\n\"Mr. Hersheimmer--Mr. Beresford--Dr. Roylance. How's the patient?\"\n\n\"Going on well. Evidently no idea of the flight of time. Asked this\nmorning how many had been saved from the _Lusitania_. Was it in the\npapers yet? That, of course, was only what was to be expected. She seems\nto have something on her mind, though.\"\n\n\"I think we can relieve her anxiety. May we go up?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nTommy's heart beat sensibly faster as they followed the doctor upstairs.\nJane Finn at last! The long-sought, the mysterious, the elusive Jane\nFinn! How wildly improbable success had seemed! And here in this house,\nher memory almost miraculously restored, lay the girl who held the\nfuture of England in her hands. A half groan broke from Tommy's lips.\nIf only Tuppence could have been at his side to share in the triumphant\nconclusion of their joint venture! Then he put the thought of Tuppence\nresolutely aside. His confidence in Sir James was growing. There was\na man who would unerringly ferret out Tuppence's whereabouts. In the\nmeantime Jane Finn! And suddenly a dread clutched at his heart. It\nseemed too easy.... Suppose they should find her dead ... stricken down\nby the hand of Mr. Brown?\n\nIn another minute he was laughing at these melodramatic fancies. The\ndoctor held open the door of a room and they passed in. On the white\nbed, bandages round her head, lay the girl. Somehow the whole scene\nseemed unreal. It was so exactly what one expected that it gave the\neffect of being beautifully staged.", "The girl looked from one to the other of them with large wondering eyes.\nSir James spoke first.\n\n\"Miss Finn,\" he said, \"this is your cousin, Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer.\"\n\nA faint flush flitted over the girl's face, as Julius stepped forward\nand took her hand.\n\n\"How do, Cousin Jane?\" he said lightly.\n\nBut Tommy caught the tremor in his voice.\n\n\"Are you really Uncle Hiram's son?\" she asked wonderingly.\n\nHer voice, with the slight warmth of the Western accent, had an almost\nthrilling quality. It seemed vaguely familiar to Tommy, but he thrust\nthe impression aside as impossible.\n\n\"Sure thing.\"\n\n\"We used to read about Uncle Hiram in the papers,\" continued the girl,\nin her low soft tones. \"But I never thought I'd meet you one day. Mother\nfigured it out that Uncle Hiram would never get over being mad with\nher.\"\n\n\"The old man was like that,\" admitted Julius. \"But I guess the new\ngeneration's sort of different. Got no use for the family feud business.\nFirst thing I thought about, soon as the war was over, was to come along\nand hunt you up.\"\n\nA shadow passed over the girl's face.\n\n\"They've been telling me things--dreadful things--that my memory went,\nand that there are years I shall never know about--years lost out of my\nlife.\"\n\n\"You didn't realize that yourself?\"\n\nThe girl's eyes opened wide.\n\n\"Why, no. It seems to me as though it were no time since we were being\nhustled into those boats. I can see it all now.\" She closed her eyes\nwith a shudder.\n\nJulius looked across at Sir James, who nodded.\n\n\"Don't worry any. It isn't worth it. Now, see here, Jane, there's\nsomething we want to know about. There was a man aboard that boat with\nsome mighty important papers on him, and the big guns in this country\nhave got a notion that he passed on the goods to you. Is that so?\"\n\nThe girl hesitated, her glance shifting to the other two. Julius\nunderstood.\n\n\"Mr. Beresford is commissioned by the British Government to get those\npapers back.", "Sir James Peel Edgerton is an English Member of Parliament,\nand might be a big gun in the Cabinet if he liked. It's owing to him\nthat we've ferreted you out at last. So you can go right ahead and tell\nus the whole story. Did Danvers give you the papers?\"\n\n\"Yes. He said they'd have a better chance with me, because they would\nsave the women and children first.\"\n\n\"Just as we thought,\" said Sir James.\n\n\"He said they were very important--that they might make all the\ndifference to the Allies. But, if it's all so long ago, and the war's\nover, what does it matter now?\"\n\n\"I guess history repeats itself, Jane. First there was a great hue\nand cry over those papers, then it all died down, and now the whole\ncaboodle's started all over again--for rather different reasons. Then\nyou can hand them over to us right away?\"\n\n\"But I can't.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I haven't got them.\"\n\n\"You--haven't--got them?\" Julius punctuated the words with little\npauses.\n\n\"No--I hid them.\"\n\n\"You _hid_ them?\"\n\n\"Yes. I got uneasy. People seemed to be watching me. It scared\nme--badly.\" She put her hand to her head. \"It's almost the last thing I\nremember before waking up in the hospital....\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said Sir James, in his quiet penetrating tones. \"What do you\nremember?\"\n\nShe turned to him obediently.\n\n\"It was at Holyhead. I came that way--I don't remember why....\"\n\n\"That doesn't matter. Go on.\"\n\n\"In the confusion on the quay I slipped away. Nobody saw me. I took a\ncar. Told the man to drive me out of the town. I watched when we got on\nthe open road. No other car was following us. I saw a path at the side\nof the road. I told the man to wait.\"\n\nShe paused, then went on. \"The path led to the cliff, and down to the\nsea between big yellow gorse bushes--they were like golden flames. I\nlooked round. There wasn't a soul in sight. But just level with my head\nthere was a hole in the rock.", "It was quite small--I could only just get\nmy hand in, but it went a long way back. I took the oilskin packet from\nround my neck and shoved it right in as far as I could. Then I tore off\na bit of gorse--My! but it did prick--and plugged the hole with it so\nthat you'd never guess there was a crevice of any kind there. Then I\nmarked the place carefully in my own mind, so that I'd find it again.\nThere was a queer boulder in the path just there--for all the world\nlike a dog sitting up begging. Then I went back to the road. The car was\nwaiting, and I drove back. I just caught the train. I was a bit ashamed\nof myself for fancying things maybe, but, by and by, I saw the man\nopposite me wink at a woman who was sitting next to me, and I felt\nscared again, and was glad the papers were safe. I went out in the\ncorridor to get a little air. I thought I'd slip into another carriage.\nBut the woman called me back, said I'd dropped something, and when I\nstooped to look, something seemed to hit me--here.\" She placed her hand\nto the back of her head. \"I don't remember anything more until I woke up\nin the hospital.\"\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Finn.\" It was Sir James who spoke. \"I hope we have not\ntired you?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right. My head aches a little, but otherwise I feel\nfine.\"\n\nJulius stepped forward and took her hand again.\n\n\"So long, Cousin Jane. I'm going to get busy after those papers, but\nI'll be back in two shakes of a dog's tail, and I'll tote you up to\nLondon and give you the time of your young life before we go back to the\nStates! I mean it--so hurry up and get well.\"\n\nIN the street they held an informal council of war. Sir James had drawn\na watch from his pocket. \"The boat train to Holyhead stops at Chester at\n12.14. If you start at once I think you can catch the connection.\"", "Tommy looked up, puzzled.\n\n\"Is there any need to hurry, sir? To-day is only the 24th.\"\n\n\"I guess it's always well to get up early in the morning,\" said Julius,\nbefore the lawyer had time to reply. \"We'll make tracks for the depot\nright away.\"\n\nA little frown had settled on Sir James's brow.\n\n\"I wish I could come with you. I am due to speak at a meeting at two\no'clock. It is unfortunate.\"\n\nThe reluctance in his tone was very evident. It was clear, on the other\nhand, that Julius was easily disposed to put up with the loss of the\nother's company.\n\n\"I guess there's nothing complicated about this deal,\" he remarked.\n\"Just a game of hide-and-seek, that's all.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Sir James.\n\n\"Sure thing. What else could it be?\"\n\n\"You are still young, Mr. Hersheimmer. At my age you will probably have\nlearnt one lesson. 'Never underestimate your adversary.'\"\n\nThe gravity of his tone impressed Tommy, but had little effect upon\nJulius.\n\n\"You think Mr. Brown might come along and take a hand? If he does, I'm\nready for him.\" He slapped his pocket. \"I carry a gun. Little Willie\nhere travels round with me everywhere.\" He produced a murderous-looking\nautomatic, and tapped it affectionately before returning it to its\nhome. \"But he won't be needed this trip. There's nobody to put Mr. Brown\nwise.\"\n\nThe lawyer shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"There was nobody to put Mr. Brown wise to the fact that Mrs. Vandemeyer\nmeant to betray him. Nevertheless, _Mrs. Vandemeyer died without\nspeaking_.\"\n\nJulius was silenced for once, and Sir James added on a lighter note:\n\n\"I only want to put you on your guard. Good-bye, and good luck. Take\nno unnecessary risks once the papers are in your hands. If there is any\nreason to believe that you have been shadowed, destroy them at once.\nGood luck to you. The game is in your hands now.\" He shook hands with\nthem both.\n\nTen minutes later the two young men were seated in a first-class\ncarriage _en route_ for Chester.", "For a long time neither of them spoke. When at length Julius broke the\nsilence, it was with a totally unexpected remark.\n\n\"Say,\" he observed thoughtfully, \"did you ever make a darned fool of\nyourself over a girl's face?\"\n\nTommy, after a moment's astonishment, searched his mind.\n\n\"Can't say I have,\" he replied at last. \"Not that I can recollect,\nanyhow. Why?\"\n\n\"Because for the last two months I've been making a sentimental idiot of\nmyself over Jane! First moment I clapped eyes on her photograph my heart\ndid all the usual stunts you read about in novels. I guess I'm ashamed\nto admit it, but I came over here determined to find her and fix it all\nup, and take her back as Mrs. Julius P. Hersheimmer!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tommy, amazed.\n\nJulius uncrossed his legs brusquely and continued:\n\n\"Just shows what an almighty fool a man can make of himself! One look at\nthe girl in the flesh, and I was cured!\"\n\nFeeling more tongue-tied than ever, Tommy ejaculated \"Oh!\" again.\n\n\"No disparagement to Jane, mind you,\" continued the other. \"She's a real\nnice girl, and some fellow will fall in love with her right away.\"\n\n\"I thought her a very good-looking girl,\" said Tommy, finding his\ntongue.\n\n\"Sure she is. But she's not like her photo one bit. At least I suppose\nshe is in a way--must be--because I recognized her right off. If I'd\nseen her in a crowd I'd have said 'There's a girl whose face I know'\nright away without any hesitation. But there was something about that\nphoto\"--Julius shook his head, and heaved a sigh--\"I guess romance is a\nmighty queer thing!\"\n\n\"It must be,\" said Tommy coldly, \"if you can come over here in love with\none girl, and propose to another within a fortnight.\"\n\nJulius had the grace to look discomposed.\n\n\"Well, you see, I'd got a sort of tired feeling that I'd never find\nJane--and that it was all plumb foolishness anyway. And then--oh, well,\nthe French, for instance, are much more sensible in the way they look at\nthings.", "They keep romance and marriage apart----\"\n\nTommy flushed.\n\n\"Well, I'm damned! If that's----\"\n\nJulius hastened to interrupt.\n\n\"Say now, don't be hasty. I don't mean what you mean. I take it\nAmericans have a higher opinion of morality than you have even. What I\nmeant was that the French set about marriage in a businesslike way--find\ntwo people who are suited to one another, look after the money affairs,\nand see the whole thing practically, and in a businesslike spirit.\"\n\n\"If you ask me,\" said Tommy, \"we're all too damned businesslike\nnowadays. We're always saying, 'Will it pay?' The men are bad enough,\nand the girls are worse!\"\n\n\"Cool down, son. Don't get so heated.\"\n\n\"I feel heated,\" said Tommy.\n\nJulius looked at him and judged it wise to say no more.\n\nHowever, Tommy had plenty of time to cool down before they reached\nHolyhead, and the cheerful grin had returned to his countenance as they\nalighted at their destination.\n\nAfter consultation, and with the aid of a road map, they were fairly\nwell agreed as to direction, so were able to hire a taxi without more\nado and drive out on the road leading to Treaddur Bay. They instructed\nthe man to go slowly, and watched narrowly so as not to miss the path.\nThey came to it not long after leaving the town, and Tommy stopped the\ncar promptly, asked in a casual tone whether the path led down to the\nsea, and hearing it did paid off the man in handsome style.\n\nA moment later the taxi was slowly chugging back to Holyhead. Tommy and\nJulius watched it out of sight, and then turned to the narrow path.\n\n\"It's the right one, I suppose?\" asked Tommy doubtfully. \"There must be\nsimply heaps along here.\"\n\n\"Sure it is. Look at the gorse. Remember what Jane said?\"\n\nTommy looked at the swelling hedges of golden blossom which bordered the\npath on either side, and was convinced.\n\nThey went down in single file, Julius leading. Twice Tommy turned his\nhead uneasily. Julius looked back.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"I don't know.", "I've got the wind up somehow. Keep fancying there's some\none following us.\"\n\n\"Can't be,\" said Julius positively. \"We'd see him.\"\n\nTommy had to admit that this was true. Nevertheless, his sense of\nuneasiness deepened. In spite of himself he believed in the omniscience\nof the enemy.\n\n\"I rather wish that fellow would come along,\" said Julius. He patted his\npocket. \"Little William here is just aching for exercise!\"\n\n\"Do you always carry it--him--with you?\" inquired Tommy with burning\ncuriosity.\n\n\"Most always. I guess you never know what might turn up.\"\n\nTommy kept a respectful silence. He was impressed by little William. It\nseemed to remove the menace of Mr. Brown farther away.\n\nThe path was now running along the side of the cliff, parallel to the\nsea. Suddenly Julius came to such an abrupt halt that Tommy cannoned\ninto him.\n\n\"What's up?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Look there. If that doesn't beat the band!\"\n\nTommy looked. Standing out half obstructing the path was a huge boulder\nwhich certainly bore a fanciful resemblance to a \"begging\" terrier.\n\n\"Well,\" said Tommy, refusing to share Julius's emotion, \"it's what we\nexpected to see, isn't it?\"\n\nJulius looked at him sadly and shook his head.\n\n\"British phlegm! Sure we expected it--but it kind of rattles me, all the\nsame, to see it sitting there just where we expected to find it!\"\n\nTommy, whose calm was, perhaps, more assumed than natural, moved his\nfeet impatiently.\n\n\"Push on. What about the hole?\"\n\nThey scanned the cliff-side narrowly. Tommy heard himself saying\nidiotically:\n\n\"The gorse won't be there after all these years.\"\n\nAnd Julius replied solemnly:\n\n\"I guess you're right.\"\n\nTommy suddenly pointed with a shaking hand.\n\n\"What about that crevice there?\"\n\nJulius replied in an awestricken voice:\n\n\"That's it--for sure.\"\n\nThey looked at each other.\n\n\"When I was in France,\" said Tommy reminiscently, \"whenever my batman\nfailed to call me, he always said that he had come over queer. I never\nbelieved it. But whether he felt it or not, there _is_ such a sensation.\nI've got it now! Badly!\"\n\nHe looked at the rock with a kind of agonized passion.", "\"Damn it!\" he cried. \"It's impossible! Five years! Think of it!\nBird's-nesting boys, picnic parties, thousands of people passing! It\ncan't be there! It's a hundred to one against its being there! It's\nagainst all reason!\"\n\nIndeed, he felt it to be impossible--more, perhaps, because he could not\nbelieve in his own success where so many others had failed. The thing\nwas too easy, therefore it could not be. The hole would be empty.\n\nJulius looked at him with a widening smile.\n\n\"I guess you're rattled now all right,\" he drawled with some enjoyment.\n\"Well, here goes!\" He thrust his hand into the crevice, and made a\nslight grimace. \"It's a tight fit. Jane's hand must be a few sizes\nsmaller than mine. I don't feel anything--no--say, what's this? Gee\nwhiz!\" And with a flourish he waved aloft a small discoloured packet.\n\"It's the goods all right. Sewn up in oilskin. Hold it while I get my\npenknife.\"\n\nThe unbelievable had happened. Tommy held the precious packet tenderly\nbetween his hands. They had succeeded!\n\n\"It's queer,\" he murmured idly, \"you'd think the stitches would have\nrotted. They look just as good as new.\"\n\nThey cut them carefully and ripped away the oilskin. Inside was a small\nfolded sheet of paper. With trembling fingers they unfolded it. The\nsheet was blank! They stared at each other, puzzled.\n\n\"A dummy?\" hazarded Julius. \"Was Danvers just a decoy?\"\n\nTommy shook his head. That solution did not satisfy him. Suddenly his\nface cleared.\n\n\"I've got it! _Sympathetic ink!_\"\n\n\"You think so?\"\n\n\"Worth trying anyhow. Heat usually does the trick. Get some sticks.\nWe'll make a fire.\"\n\nIn a few minutes the little fire of twigs and leaves was blazing\nmerrily. Tommy held the sheet of paper near the glow. The paper curled a\nlittle with the heat. Nothing more.\n\nSuddenly Julius grasped his arm, and pointed to where characters were\nappearing in a faint brown colour.\n\n\"Gee whiz! You've got it! Say, that idea of yours was great. It never\noccurred to me.\"\n\nTommy held the paper in position some minutes longer until he judged the\nheat had done its work.", "Then he withdrew it. A moment later he uttered a\ncry.\n\nAcross the sheet in neat brown printing ran the words: WITH THE\nCOMPLIMENTS OF MR. BROWN.\n\nFOR a moment or two they stood staring at each other stupidly, dazed\nwith the shock. Somehow, inexplicably, Mr. Brown had forestalled them.\nTommy accepted defeat quietly. Not so Julius.\n\n\"How in tarnation did he get ahead of us? That's what beats me!\" he\nended up.\n\nTommy shook his head, and said dully:\n\n\"It accounts for the stitches being new. We might have guessed....\"\n\n\"Never mind the darned stitches. How did he get ahead of us? We hustled\nall we knew. It's downright impossible for anyone to get here quicker\nthan we did. And, anyway, how did he know? Do you reckon there was a\ndictaphone in Jane's room? I guess there must have been.\"\n\nBut Tommy's common sense pointed out objections.\n\n\"No one could have known beforehand that she was going to be in that\nhouse--much less that particular room.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" admitted Julius. \"Then one of the nurses was a crook and\nlistened at the door. How's that?\"\n\n\"I don't see that it matters anyway,\" said Tommy wearily. \"He may have\nfound out some months ago, and removed the papers, then----No, by Jove,\nthat won't wash! They'd have been published at once.\"\n\n\"Sure thing they would! No, some one's got ahead of us to-day by an hour\nor so. But how they did it gets my goat.\"\n\n\"I wish that chap Peel Edgerton had been with us,\" said Tommy\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"Why?\" Julius stared. \"The mischief was done when we came.\"\n\n\"Yes----\" Tommy hesitated. He could not explain his own feeling--the\nillogical idea that the K.C.'s presence would somehow have averted the\ncatastrophe. He reverted to his former point of view. \"It's no good\narguing about how it was done. The game's up. We've failed. There's only\none thing for me to do.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Get back to London as soon as possible. Mr. Carter must be warned. It's\nonly a matter of hours now before the blow falls.", "But, at any rate, he\nought to know the worst.\"\n\nThe duty was an unpleasant one, but Tommy had no intention of shirking\nit. He must report his failure to Mr. Carter. After that his work was\ndone. He took the midnight mail to London. Julius elected to stay the\nnight at Holyhead.\n\nHalf an hour after arrival, haggard and pale, Tommy stood before his\nchief.\n\n\"I've come to report, sir. I've failed--failed badly.\"\n\nMr. Carter eyed him sharply.\n\n\"You mean that the treaty----\"\n\n\"Is in the hands of Mr. Brown, sir.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Carter quietly. The expression on his face did not\nchange, but Tommy caught the flicker of despair in his eyes. It\nconvinced him as nothing else had done that the outlook was hopeless.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Carter after a minute or two, \"we mustn't sag at the\nknees, I suppose. I'm glad to know definitely. We must do what we can.\"\n\nThrough Tommy's mind flashed the assurance: \"It's hopeless, and he knows\nit's hopeless!\"\n\nThe other looked up at him.\n\n\"Don't take it to heart, lad,\" he said kindly. \"You did your best. You\nwere up against one of the biggest brains of the century. And you came\nvery near success. Remember that.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir. It's awfully decent of you.\"\n\n\"I blame myself. I have been blaming myself ever since I heard this\nother news.\"\n\nSomething in his tone attracted Tommy's attention. A new fear gripped at\nhis heart.\n\n\"Is there--something more, sir?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid so,\" said Mr. Carter gravely. He stretched out his hand to a\nsheet on the table.\n\n\"Tuppence----?\" faltered Tommy.\n\n\"Read for yourself.\"\n\nThe typewritten words danced before his eyes. The description of a green\ntoque, a coat with a handkerchief in the pocket marked P.L.C. He looked\nan agonized question at Mr. Carter. The latter replied to it:\n\n\"Washed up on the Yorkshire coast--near Ebury. I'm afraid--it looks very\nmuch like foul play.\"\n\n\"My God!\" gasped Tommy. \"_Tuppence!_ Those devils--I'll never rest till\nI've got even with them! I'll hunt them down!", "I'll----\"\n\nThe pity on Mr. Carter's face stopped him.\n\n\"I know what you feel like, my poor boy. But it's no good. You'll waste\nyour strength uselessly. It may sound harsh, but my advice to you is:\nCut your losses. Time's merciful. You'll forget.\"\n\n\"Forget Tuppence? Never!\"\n\nMr. Carter shook his head.\n\n\"So you think now. Well, it won't bear thinking of--that brave little\ngirl! I'm sorry about the whole business--confoundedly sorry.\"\n\nTommy came to himself with a start.\n\n\"I'm taking up your time, sir,\" he said with an effort. \"There's no need\nfor you to blame yourself. I dare say we were a couple of young fools to\ntake on such a job. You warned us all right. But I wish to God I'd been\nthe one to get it in the neck. Good-bye, sir.\"\n\nBack at the _Ritz_, Tommy packed up his few belongings mechanically,\nhis thoughts far away. He was still bewildered by the introduction of\ntragedy into his cheerful commonplace existence. What fun they had\nhad together, he and Tuppence! And now--oh, he couldn't believe it--it\ncouldn't be true! _Tuppence--dead!_ Little Tuppence, brimming over with\nlife! It was a dream, a horrible dream. Nothing more.\n\nThey brought him a note, a few kind words of sympathy from Peel\nEdgerton, who had read the news in the paper. (There had been a large\nheadline: EX-V.A.D. FEARED DROWNED.) The letter ended with the offer\nof a post on a ranch in the Argentine, where Sir James had considerable\ninterests.\n\n\"Kind old beggar,\" muttered Tommy, as he flung it aside.\n\nThe door opened, and Julius burst in with his usual violence. He held an\nopen newspaper in his hand.\n\n\"Say, what's all this? They seem to have got some fool idea about\nTuppence.\"\n\n\"It's true,\" said Tommy quietly.\n\n\"You mean they've done her in?\"\n\nTommy nodded.\n\n\"I suppose when they got the treaty she--wasn't any good to them any\nlonger, and they were afraid to let her go.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm darned!\" said Julius. \"Little Tuppence. She sure was the\npluckiest little girl----\"\n\nBut suddenly something seemed to crack in Tommy's brain.", "He rose to his\nfeet.\n\n\"Oh, get out! You don't really care, damn you! You asked her to marry\nyou in your rotten cold-blooded way, but I _loved_ her. I'd have given\nthe soul out of my body to save her from harm. I'd have stood by without\na word and let her marry you, because you could have given her the sort\nof time she ought to have had, and I was only a poor devil without a\npenny to bless himself with. But it wouldn't have been because I didn't\ncare!\"\n\n\"See here,\" began Julius temperately.\n\n\"Oh, go to the devil! I can't stand your coming here and talking about\n'little Tuppence.' Go and look after your cousin. Tuppence is my girl!\nI've always loved her, from the time we played together as kids. We\ngrew up and it was just the same. I shall never forget when I was in\nhospital, and she came in in that ridiculous cap and apron! It was like\na miracle to see the girl I loved turn up in a nurse's kit----\"\n\nBut Julius interrupted him.\n\n\"A nurse's kit! Gee whiz! I must be going to Colney Hatch! I could swear\nI've seen Jane in a nurse's cap too. And that's plumb impossible! No,\nby gum, I've got it! It was her I saw talking to Whittington at that\nnursing home in Bournemouth. She wasn't a patient there! She was a\nnurse!\"\n\n\"I dare say,\" said Tommy angrily, \"she's probably been in with them from\nthe start. I shouldn't wonder if she stole those papers from Danvers to\nbegin with.\"\n\n\"I'm darned if she did!\" shouted Julius. \"She's my cousin, and as\npatriotic a girl as ever stepped.\"\n\n\"I don't care a damn what she is, but get out of here!\" retorted Tommy\nalso at the top of his voice.\n\nThe young men were on the point of coming to blows. But suddenly, with\nan almost magical abruptness, Julius's anger abated.\n\n\"All right, son,\" he said quietly, \"I'm going. I don't blame you any for\nwhat you've been saying. It's mighty lucky you did say it.", "I've been\nthe most almighty blithering darned idiot that it's possible to imagine.\nCalm down\"--Tommy had made an impatient gesture--\"I'm going right away\nnow--going to the London and North Western Railway depot, if you want to\nknow.\"\n\n\"I don't care a damn where you're going,\" growled Tommy.\n\nAs the door closed behind Julius, he returned to his suit-case.\n\n\"That's the lot,\" he murmured, and rang the bell.\n\n\"Take my luggage down.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Going away, sir?\"\n\n\"I'm going to the devil,\" said Tommy, regardless of the menial's\nfeelings.\n\nThat functionary, however, merely replied respectfully:\n\n\"Yes, sir. Shall I call a taxi?\"\n\nTommy nodded.\n\nWhere was he going? He hadn't the faintest idea. Beyond a fixed\ndetermination to get even with Mr. Brown he had no plans. He re-read Sir\nJames's letter, and shook his head. Tuppence must be avenged. Still, it\nwas kind of the old fellow.\n\n\"Better answer it, I suppose.\" He went across to the writing-table.\nWith the usual perversity of bedroom stationery, there were innumerable\nenvelopes and no paper. He rang. No one came. Tommy fumed at the\ndelay. Then he remembered that there was a good supply in Julius's\nsitting-room. The American had announced his immediate departure, there\nwould be no fear of running up against him. Besides, he wouldn't mind if\nhe did. He was beginning to be rather ashamed of the things he had said.\nOld Julius had taken them jolly well. He'd apologize if he found him\nthere.\n\nBut the room was deserted. Tommy walked across to the writing-table,\nand opened the middle drawer. A photograph, carelessly thrust in face\nupwards, caught his eye. For a moment he stood rooted to the ground.\nThen he took it out, shut the drawer, walked slowly over to an\narm-chair, and sat down still staring at the photograph in his hand.\n\nWhat on earth was a photograph of the French girl Annette doing in\nJulius Hersheimmer's writing-table?\n\nTHE Prime Minister tapped the desk in front of him with nervous fingers.\nHis face was worn and harassed.", "He took up his conversation with Mr.\nCarter at the point it had broken off. \"I don't understand,\" he said.\n\"Do you really mean that things are not so desperate after all?\"\n\n\"So this lad seems to think.\"\n\n\"Let's have a look at his letter again.\"\n\nMr. Carter handed it over. It was written in a sprawling boyish hand.\n\n\"DEAR MR. CARTER,\n\n\"Something's turned up that has given me a jar. Of course I may be\nsimply making an awful ass of myself, but I don't think so. If my\nconclusions are right, that girl at Manchester was just a plant. The\nwhole thing was prearranged, sham packet and all, with the object of\nmaking us think the game was up--therefore I fancy that we must have\nbeen pretty hot on the scent.\n\n\"I think I know who the real Jane Finn is, and I've even got an idea\nwhere the papers are. That last's only a guess, of course, but I've a\nsort of feeling it'll turn out right. Anyhow, I enclose it in a sealed\nenvelope for what it's worth. I'm going to ask you not to open it until\nthe very last moment, midnight on the 28th, in fact. You'll understand\nwhy in a minute. You see, I've figured it out that those things of\nTuppence's are a plant too, and she's no more drowned than I am. The way\nI reason is this: as a last chance they'll let Jane Finn escape in\nthe hope that she's been shamming this memory stunt, and that once she\nthinks she's free she'll go right away to the cache. Of course it's\nan awful risk for them to take, because she knows all about them--but\nthey're pretty desperate to get hold of that treaty. _But if they know\nthat the papers have been recovered by us_, neither of those two girls'\nlives will be worth an hour's purchase. I must try and get hold of\nTuppence before Jane escapes.\n\n\"I want a repeat of that telegram that was sent to Tuppence at the\n_Ritz_. Sir James Peel Edgerton said you would be able to manage that\nfor me.", "He's frightfully clever.\n\n\"One last thing--please have that house in Soho watched day and night.\n\n\"Yours, etc.,\n\n\"THOMAS BERESFORD.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister looked up.\n\n\"The enclosure?\"\n\nMr. Carter smiled dryly.\n\n\"In the vaults of the Bank. I am taking no chances.\"\n\n\"You don't think\"--the Prime Minister hesitated a minute--\"that it would\nbe better to open it now? Surely we ought to secure the document, that\nis, provided the young man's guess turns out to be correct, at once. We\ncan keep the fact of having done so quite secret.\"\n\n\"Can we? I'm not so sure. There are spies all round us. Once it's known\nI wouldn't give that\"--he snapped his fingers--\"for the life of those\ntwo girls. No, the boy trusted me, and I shan't let him down.\"\n\n\"Well, well, we must leave it at that, then. What's he like, this lad?\"\n\n\"Outwardly, he's an ordinary clean-limbed, rather block-headed young\nEnglishman. Slow in his mental processes. On the other hand, it's quite\nimpossible to lead him astray through his imagination. He hasn't got\nany--so he's difficult to deceive. He worries things out slowly, and\nonce he's got hold of anything he doesn't let go. The little lady's\nquite different. More intuition and less common sense. They make a\npretty pair working together. Pace and stamina.\"\n\n\"He seems confident,\" mused the Prime Minister.\n\n\"Yes, and that's what gives me hope. He's the kind of diffident youth\nwho would have to be _very_ sure before he ventured an opinion at all.\"\n\nA half smile came to the other's lips.\n\n\"And it is this--boy who will defeat the master criminal of our time?\"\n\n\"This--boy, as you say! But I sometimes fancy I see a shadow behind.\"\n\n\"You mean?\"\n\n\"Peel Edgerton.\"\n\n\"Peel Edgerton?\" said the Prime Minister in astonishment.\n\n\"Yes. I see his hand in _this_.\" He struck the open letter. \"He's\nthere--working in the dark, silently, unobtrusively. I've always felt\nthat if anyone was to run Mr. Brown to earth, Peel Edgerton would be the\nman. I tell you he's on the case now, but doesn't want it known.", "By the\nway, I got rather an odd request from him the other day.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"He sent me a cutting from some American paper. It referred to a man's\nbody found near the docks in New York about three weeks ago. He asked me\nto collect any information on the subject I could.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nCarter shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I couldn't get much. Young fellow about thirty-five--poorly\ndressed--face very badly disfigured. He was never identified.\"\n\n\"And you fancy that the two matters are connected in some way?\"\n\n\"Somehow I do. I may be wrong, of course.\"\n\nThere was a pause, then Mr. Carter continued:\n\n\"I asked him to come round here. Not that we'll get anything out of him\nhe doesn't want to tell. His legal instincts are too strong. But there's\nno doubt he can throw light on one or two obscure points in young\nBeresford's letter. Ah, here he is!\"\n\nThe two men rose to greet the new-comer. A half whimsical thought\nflashed across the Premier's mind. \"My successor, perhaps!\"\n\n\"We've had a letter from young Beresford,\" said Mr. Carter, coming to\nthe point at once. \"You've seen him, I suppose?\"\n\n\"You suppose wrong,\" said the lawyer.\n\n\"Oh!\" Mr. Carter was a little nonplussed.\n\nSir James smiled, and stroked his chin.\n\n\"He rang me up,\" he volunteered.\n\n\"Would you have any objection to telling us exactly what passed between\nyou?\"\n\n\"Not at all. He thanked me for a certain letter which I had written to\nhim--as a matter of fact, I had offered him a job. Then he reminded\nme of something I had said to him at Manchester respecting that bogus\ntelegram which lured Miss Cowley away. I asked him if anything untoward\nhad occurred. He said it had--that in a drawer in Mr. Hersheimmer's room\nhe had discovered a photograph.\" The lawyer paused, then continued: \"I\nasked him if the photograph bore the name and address of a Californian\nphotographer. He replied: 'You're on to it, sir. It had.' Then he went\non to tell me something I _didn't_ know.", "The original of that photograph\nwas the French girl, Annette, who saved his life.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Exactly. I asked the young man with some curiosity what he had done\nwith the photograph. He replied that he had put it back where he found\nit.\" The lawyer paused again. \"That was good, you know--distinctly\ngood. He can use his brains, that young fellow. I congratulated him. The\ndiscovery was a providential one. Of course, from the moment that the\ngirl in Manchester was proved to be a plant everything was altered.\nYoung Beresford saw that for himself without my having to tell it\nhim. But he felt he couldn't trust his judgment on the subject of\nMiss Cowley. Did I think she was alive? I told him, duly weighing the\nevidence, that there was a very decided chance in favour of it. That\nbrought us back to the telegram.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I advised him to apply to you for a copy of the original wire. It\nhad occurred to me as probable that, after Miss Cowley flung it on the\nfloor, certain words might have been erased and altered with the express\nintention of setting searchers on a false trail.\"\n\nCarter nodded. He took a sheet from his pocket, and read aloud:\n\n\"Come at once, Astley Priors, Gatehouse, Kent. Great\ndevelopments--TOMMY.\"\n\n\"Very simple,\" said Sir James, \"and very ingenious. Just a few words\nto alter, and the thing was done. And the one important clue they\noverlooked.\"\n\n\"What was that?\"\n\n\"The page-boy's statement that Miss Cowley drove to Charing Cross. They\nwere so sure of themselves that they took it for granted he had made a\nmistake.\"\n\n\"Then young Beresford is now?\"\n\n\"At Gatehouse, Kent, unless I am much mistaken.\"\n\nMr. Carter looked at him curiously.\n\n\"I rather wonder you're not there too, Peel Edgerton?\"\n\n\"Ah, I'm busy on a case.\"\n\n\"I thought you were on your holiday?\"\n\n\"Oh, I've not been briefed. Perhaps it would be more correct to say I'm\npreparing a case. Any more facts about that American chap for me?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not. Is it important to find out who he was?\"", "\"Oh, I know who he was,\" said Sir James easily. \"I can't prove it\nyet--but I know.\"\n\nThe other two asked no questions. They had an instinct that it would be\nmere waste of breath.\n\n\"But what I don't understand,\" said the Prime-Minister suddenly, \"is how\nthat photograph came to be in Mr. Hersheimmer's drawer?\"\n\n\"Perhaps it never left it,\" suggested the lawyer gently.\n\n\"But the bogus inspector? Inspector Brown?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Sir James thoughtfully. He rose to his feet. \"I mustn't keep\nyou. Go on with the affairs of the nation. I must get back to--my case.\"\n\nTwo days later Julius Hersheimmer returned from Manchester. A note from\nTommy lay on his table:\n\n\"DEAR HERSHEIMMER,\n\n\"Sorry I lost my temper. In case I don't see you again, good-bye. I've\nbeen offered a job in the Argentine, and might as well take it.\n\n\"Yours,\n\n\"TOMMY BERESFORD.\"\n\nA peculiar smile lingered for a moment on Julius's face. He threw the\nletter into the waste-paper basket.\n\n\"The darned fool!\" he murmured.\n\nAFTER ringing up Sir James, Tommy's next procedure was to make a call\nat South Audley Mansions. He found Albert discharging his professional\nduties, and introduced himself without more ado as a friend of\nTuppence's. Albert unbent immediately.\n\n\"Things has been very quiet here lately,\" he said wistfully. \"Hope the\nyoung lady's keeping well, sir?\"\n\n\"That's just the point, Albert. She's disappeared.\"\n\n\"You don't mean as the crooks have got her?\"\n\n\"They have.\"\n\n\"In the Underworld?\"\n\n\"No, dash it all, in this world!\"\n\n\"It's a h'expression, sir,\" explained Albert. \"At the pictures the\ncrooks always have a restoorant in the Underworld. But do you think as\nthey've done her in, sir?\"\n\n\"I hope not. By the way, have you by any chance an aunt, a cousin,\na grandmother, or any other suitable female relation who might be\nrepresented as being likely to kick the bucket?\"\n\nA delighted grin spread slowly over Albert's countenance.\n\n\"I'm on, sir. My poor aunt what lives in the country has been mortal bad\nfor a long time, and she's asking for me with her dying breath.\"", "Tommy nodded approval.\n\n\"Can you report this in the proper quarter and meet me at Charing Cross\nin an hour's time?\"\n\n\"I'll be there, sir. You can count on me.\"\n\nAs Tommy had judged, the faithful Albert proved an invaluable ally. The\ntwo took up their quarters at the inn in Gatehouse. To Albert fell the\ntask of collecting information. There was no difficulty about it.\n\nAstley Priors was the property of a Dr. Adams. The doctor no longer\npracticed, had retired, the landlord believed, but he took a few private\npatients--here the good fellow tapped his forehead knowingly--\"balmy\nones! You understand!\" The doctor was a popular figure in the village,\nsubscribed freely to all the local sports--\"a very pleasant, affable\ngentleman.\" Been there long? Oh, a matter of ten years or so--might be\nlonger. Scientific gentleman, he was. Professors and people often came\ndown from town to see him. Anyway, it was a gay house, always visitors.\n\nIn the face of all this volubility, Tommy felt doubts. Was it possible\nthat this genial, well-known figure could be in reality a dangerous\ncriminal? His life seemed so open and aboveboard. No hint of sinister\ndoings. Suppose it was all a gigantic mistake? Tommy felt a cold chill\nat the thought.\n\nThen he remembered the private patients--\"balmy ones.\" He inquired\ncarefully if there was a young lady amongst them, describing Tuppence.\nBut nothing much seemed to be known about the patients--they were seldom\nseen outside the grounds. A guarded description of Annette also failed\nto provoke recognition.\n\nAstley Priors was a pleasant red-brick edifice, surrounded by\nwell-wooded grounds which effectually shielded the house from\nobservation from the road.\n\nOn the first evening Tommy, accompanied by Albert, explored the grounds.\nOwing to Albert's insistence they dragged themselves along painfully on\ntheir stomachs, thereby producing a great deal more noise than if\nthey had stood upright. In any case, these precautions were totally\nunnecessary. The grounds, like those of any other private house after\nnightfall, seemed untenanted. Tommy had imagined a possible fierce\nwatchdog.", "Albert's fancy ran to a puma, or a tame cobra. But they\nreached a shrubbery near the house quite unmolested.\n\nThe blinds of the dining-room window were up. There was a large company\nassembled round the table. The port was passing from hand to hand. It\nseemed a normal, pleasant company. Through the open window scraps of\nconversation floated out disjointedly on the night air. It was a heated\ndiscussion on county cricket!\n\nAgain Tommy felt that cold chill of uncertainty. It seemed impossible\nto believe that these people were other than they seemed. Had he been\nfooled once more? The fair-bearded, spectacled gentleman who sat at the\nhead of the table looked singularly honest and normal.\n\nTommy slept badly that night. The following morning the indefatigable\nAlbert, having cemented an alliance with the greengrocer's boy, took the\nlatter's place and ingratiated himself with the cook at Malthouse.\nHe returned with the information that she was undoubtedly \"one of\nthe crooks,\" but Tommy mistrusted the vividness of his imagination.\nQuestioned, he could adduce nothing in support of his statement except\nhis own opinion that she wasn't the usual kind. You could see that at a\nglance.\n\nThe substitution being repeated (much to the pecuniary advantage of the\nreal greengrocer's boy) on the following day, Albert brought back the\nfirst piece of hopeful news. There _was_ a French young lady staying\nin the house. Tommy put his doubts aside. Here was confirmation of\nhis theory. But time pressed. To-day was the 27th. The 29th was the\nmuch-talked-of \"Labour Day,\" about which all sorts of rumours were\nrunning riot. Newspapers were getting agitated. Sensational hints of a\nLabour _coup d'etat_ were freely reported. The Government said nothing.\nIt knew and was prepared. There were rumours of dissension among the\nLabour leaders. They were not of one mind. The more far-seeing among\nthem realized that what they proposed might well be a death-blow to the\nEngland that at heart they loved. They shrank from the starvation and\nmisery a general strike would entail, and were willing to meet the\nGovernment half-way.", "But behind them were subtle, insistent forces at\nwork, urging the memories of old wrongs, deprecating the weakness of\nhalf-and-half measures, fomenting misunderstandings.\n\nTommy felt that, thanks to Mr. Carter, he understood the position fairly\naccurately. With the fatal document in the hands of Mr. Brown,\npublic opinion would swing to the side of the Labour extremists and\nrevolutionists. Failing that, the battle was an even chance. The\nGovernment with a loyal army and police force behind them might\nwin--but at a cost of great suffering. But Tommy nourished another and\na preposterous dream. With Mr. Brown unmasked and captured he\nbelieved, rightly or wrongly, that the whole organization would crumble\nignominiously and instantaneously. The strange permeating influence\nof the unseen chief held it together. Without him, Tommy believed an\ninstant panic would set in; and, the honest men left to themselves, an\neleventh-hour reconciliation would be possible.\n\n\"This is a one-man show,\" said Tommy to himself. \"The thing to do is to\nget hold of the man.\"\n\nIt was partly in furtherance of this ambitious design that he had\nrequested Mr. Carter not to open the sealed envelope. The draft\ntreaty was Tommy's bait. Every now and then he was aghast at his own\npresumption. How dared he think that he had discovered what so many\nwiser and clever men had overlooked? Nevertheless, he stuck tenaciously\nto his idea.\n\nThat evening he and Albert once more penetrated the grounds of Astley\nPriors. Tommy's ambition was somehow or other to gain admission to the\nhouse itself. As they approached cautiously, Tommy gave a sudden gasp.\n\nOn the second floor window some one standing between the window and\nthe light in the room threw a silhouette on the blind. It was one Tommy\nwould have recognized anywhere! Tuppence was in that house!\n\nHe clutched Albert by the shoulder.\n\n\"Stay here! When I begin to sing, watch that window.\"\n\nHe retreated hastily to a position on the main drive, and began in a\ndeep roar, coupled with an unsteady gait, the following ditty:\n\n\n          I am a Soldier\n          A jolly British Soldier;\n          You can see that I'm a Soldier by my feet....\n\nIt had been a favourite on the gramophone in Tuppence's hospital days.", "He did not doubt but that she would recognize it and draw her own\nconclusions. Tommy had not a note of music in his voice, but his lungs\nwere excellent. The noise he produced was terrific.\n\nPresently an unimpeachable butler, accompanied by an equally\nunimpeachable footman, issued from the front door. The butler\nremonstrated with him. Tommy continued to sing, addressing the butler\naffectionately as \"dear old whiskers.\" The footman took him by one arm,\nthe butler by the other. They ran him down the drive, and neatly out\nof the gate. The butler threatened him with the police if he intruded\nagain. It was beautifully done--soberly and with perfect decorum. Anyone\nwould have sworn that the butler was a real butler, the footman a real\nfootman--only, as it happened, the butler was Whittington!\n\nTommy retired to the inn and waited for Albert's return. At last that\nworthy made his appearance.\n\n\"Well?\" cried Tommy eagerly.\n\n\"It's all right. While they was a-running of you out the window opened,\nand something was chucked out.\" He handed a scrap of paper to Tommy. \"It\nwas wrapped round a letterweight.\"\n\nOn the paper were scrawled three words: \"To-morrow--same time.\"\n\n\"Good egg!\" cried Tommy. \"We're getting going.\"\n\n\"I wrote a message on a piece of paper, wrapped it round a stone, and\nchucked it through the window,\" continued Albert breathlessly.\n\nTommy groaned.\n\n\"Your zeal will be the undoing of us, Albert. What did you say?\"\n\n\"Said we was a-staying at the inn. If she could get away, to come there\nand croak like a frog.\"\n\n\"She'll know that's you,\" said Tommy with a sigh of relief. \"Your\nimagination runs away with you, you know, Albert. Why, you wouldn't\nrecognize a frog croaking if you heard it.\"\n\nAlbert looked rather crest-fallen.\n\n\"Cheer up,\" said Tommy. \"No harm done. That butler's an old friend of\nmine--I bet he knew who I was, though he didn't let on. It's not their\ngame to show suspicion. That's why we've found it fairly plain sailing.\nThey don't want to discourage me altogether.", "On the other hand, they\ndon't want to make it too easy. I'm a pawn in their game, Albert, that's\nwhat I am. You see, if the spider lets the fly walk out too easily,\nthe fly might suspect it was a put-up job. Hence the usefulness of that\npromising youth, Mr. T. Beresford, who's blundered in just at the right\nmoment for them. But later, Mr. T. Beresford had better look out!\"\n\nTommy retired for the night in a state of some elation. He had\nelaborated a careful plan for the following evening. He felt sure that\nthe inhabitants of Astley Priors would not interfere with him up to\na certain point. It was after that that Tommy proposed to give them a\nsurprise.\n\nAbout twelve o'clock, however, his calm was rudely shaken. He was told\nthat some one was demanding him in the bar. The applicant proved to be a\nrude-looking carter well coated with mud.\n\n\"Well, my good fellow, what is it?\" asked Tommy.\n\n\"Might this be for you, sir?\" The carter held out a very dirty folded\nnote, on the outside of which was written: \"Take this to the gentleman\nat the inn near Astley Priors. He will give you ten shillings.\"\n\nThe handwriting was Tuppence's. Tommy appreciated her quick-wittedness\nin realizing that he might be staying at the inn under an assumed name.\nHe snatched at it.\n\n\"That's all right.\"\n\nThe man withheld it.\n\n\"What about my ten shillings?\"\n\nTommy hastily produced a ten-shilling note, and the man relinquished his\nfind. Tommy unfastened it.\n\n\"DEAR TOMMY,\n\n\"I knew it was you last night. Don't go this evening. They'll be lying\nin wait for you. They're taking us away this morning. I heard something\nabout Wales--Holyhead, I think. I'll drop this on the road if I get a\nchance. Annette told me how you'd escaped. Buck up.\n\n\"Yours,\n\n\"TWOPENCE.\"\n\nTommy raised a shout for Albert before he had even finished perusing\nthis characteristic epistle.\n\n\"Pack my bag! We're off!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" The boots of Albert could be heard racing upstairs.\nHolyhead?", "Did that mean that, after all---- Tommy was puzzled. He read\non slowly.\n\nThe boots of Albert continued to be active on the floor above.\n\nSuddenly a second shout came from below.\n\n\"Albert! I'm a damned fool! Unpack that bag!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nTommy smoothed out the note thoughtfully.\n\n\"Yes, a damned fool,\" he said softly. \"But so's some one else! And at\nlast I know who it is!\"\n\nIN his suite at Claridge's, Kramenin reclined on a couch and dictated to\nhis secretary in sibilant Russian.\n\nPresently the telephone at the secretary's elbow purred, and he took up\nthe receiver, spoke for a minute or two, then turned to his employer.\n\n\"Some one below is asking for you.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\"\n\n\"He gives the name of Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer.\"\n\n\"Hersheimmer,\" repeated Kramenin thoughtfully. \"I have heard that name\nbefore.\"\n\n\"His father was one of the steel kings of America,\" explained the\nsecretary, whose business it was to know everything. \"This young man\nmust be a millionaire several times over.\"\n\nThe other's eyes narrowed appreciatively.\n\n\"You had better go down and see him, Ivan. Find out what he wants.\"\n\nThe secretary obeyed, closing the door noiselessly behind him. In a few\nminutes he returned.\n\n\"He declines to state his business--says it is entirely private and\npersonal, and that he must see you.\"\n\n\"A millionaire several times over,\" murmured Kramenin. \"Bring him up, my\ndear Ivan.\"\n\nThe secretary left the room once more, and returned escorting Julius.\n\n\"Monsieur Kramenin?\" said the latter abruptly.\n\nThe Russian, studying him attentively with his pale venomous eyes,\nbowed.\n\n\"Pleased to meet you,\" said the American. \"I've got some very important\nbusiness I'd like to talk over with you, if I can see you alone.\" He\nlooked pointedly at the other.\n\n\"My secretary, Monsieur Grieber, from whom I have no secrets.\"\n\n\"That may be so--but I have,\" said Julius dryly. \"So I'd be obliged if\nyou'd tell him to scoot.\"\n\n\"Ivan,\" said the Russian softly, \"perhaps you would not mind retiring\ninto the next room----\"\n\n\"The next room won't do,\" interrupted Julius. \"I know these ducal\nsuites--and I want this one plumb empty except for you and me.", "Send him\nround to a store to buy a penn'orth of peanuts.\"\n\nThough not particularly enjoying the American's free and easy manner\nof speech, Kramenin was devoured by curiosity. \"Will your business take\nlong to state?\"\n\n\"Might be an all night job if you caught on.\"\n\n\"Very good, Ivan. I shall not require you again this evening. Go to the\ntheatre--take a night off.\"\n\n\"Thank you, your excellency.\"\n\nThe secretary bowed and departed.\n\nJulius stood at the door watching his retreat. Finally, with a satisfied\nsigh, he closed it, and came back to his position in the centre of the\nroom.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Hersheimmer, perhaps you will be so kind as to come to the\npoint?\"\n\n\"I guess that won't take a minute,\" drawled Julius. Then, with an abrupt\nchange of manner: \"Hands up--or I shoot!\"\n\nFor a moment Kramenin stared blindly into the big automatic, then, with\nalmost comical haste, he flung up his hands above his head. In that\ninstant Julius had taken his measure. The man he had to deal with was an\nabject physical coward--the rest would be easy.\n\n\"This is an outrage,\" cried the Russian in a high hysterical voice. \"An\noutrage! Do you mean to kill me?\"\n\n\"Not if you keep your voice down. Don't go edging sideways towards that\nbell. That's better.\"\n\n\"What do you want? Do nothing rashly. Remember my life is of the utmost\nvalue to my country. I may have been maligned----\"\n\n\"I reckon,\" said Julius, \"that the man who let daylight into you would\nbe doing humanity a good turn. But you needn't worry any. I'm not\nproposing to kill you this trip--that is, if you're reasonable.\"\n\nThe Russian quailed before the stern menace in the other's eyes. He\npassed his tongue over his dry lips.\n\n\"What do you want? Money?\"\n\n\"No. I want Jane Finn.\"\n\n\"Jane Finn? I--never heard of her!\"\n\n\"You're a darned liar! You know perfectly who I mean.\"\n\n\"I tell you I've never heard of the girl.\"\n\n\"And I tell you,\" retorted Julius, \"that Little Willie here is just\nhopping mad to go off!\"", "The Russian wilted visibly.\n\n\"You wouldn't dare----\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I would, son!\"\n\nKramenin must have recognized something in the voice that carried\nconviction, for he said sullenly:\n\n\"Well? Granted I do know who you mean--what of it?\"\n\n\"You will tell me now--right here--where she is to be found.\"\n\nKramenin shook his head.\n\n\"I daren't.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I daren't. You ask an impossibility.\"\n\n\"Afraid, eh? Of whom? Mr. Brown? Ah, that tickles you up! There is such\na person, then? I doubted it. And the mere mention of him scares you\nstiff!\"\n\n\"I have seen him,\" said the Russian slowly. \"Spoken to him face to face.\nI did not know it until afterwards. He was one of a crowd. I should not\nknow him again. Who is he really? I do not know. But I know this--he is\na man to fear.\"\n\n\"He'll never know,\" said Julius.\n\n\"He knows everything--and his vengeance is swift. Even\nI--Kramenin!--would not be exempt!\"\n\n\"Then you won't do as I ask you?\"\n\n\"You ask an impossibility.\"\n\n\"Sure that's a pity for you,\" said Julius cheerfully. \"But the world in\ngeneral will benefit.\" He raised the revolver.\n\n\"Stop,\" shrieked the Russian. \"You cannot mean to shoot me?\"\n\n\"Of course I do. I've always heard you Revolutionists held life cheap,\nbut it seems there's a difference when it's your own life in question.\nI gave you just one chance of saving your dirty skin, and that you\nwouldn't take!\"\n\n\"They would kill me!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Julius pleasantly, \"it's up to you. But I'll just say this.\nLittle Willie here is a dead cert, and if I was you I'd take a sporting\nchance with Mr. Brown!\"\n\n\"You will hang if you shoot me,\" muttered the Russian irresolutely.\n\n\"No, stranger, that's where you're wrong. You forget the dollars. A\nbig crowd of solicitors will get busy, and they'll get some high-brow\ndoctors on the job, and the end of it all will be that they'll say my\nbrain was unhinged. I shall spend a few months in a quiet sanatorium, my\nmental health will improve, the doctors will declare me sane again, and\nall will end happily for little Julius.", "I guess I can bear a few months'\nretirement in order to rid the world of you, but don't you kid yourself\nI'll hang for it!\"\n\nThe Russian believed him. Corrupt himself, he believed implicitly in the\npower of money. He had read of American murder trials running much on\nthe lines indicated by Julius. He had bought and sold justice himself.\nThis virile young American, with the significant drawling voice, had the\nwhip hand of him.\n\n\"I'm going to count five,\" continued Julius, \"and I guess, if you let me\nget past four, you needn't worry any about Mr. Brown. Maybe he'll send\nsome flowers to the funeral, but _you_ won't smell them! Are you ready?\nI'll begin. One--two--three--four----\"\n\nThe Russian interrupted with a shriek:\n\n\"Do not shoot. I will do all you wish.\"\n\nJulius lowered the revolver.\n\n\"I thought you'd hear sense. Where is the girl?\"\n\n\"At Gatehouse, in Kent. Astley Priors, the place is called.\"\n\n\"Is she a prisoner there?\"\n\n\"She's not allowed to leave the house--though it's safe enough really.\nThe little fool has lost her memory, curse her!\"\n\n\"That's been annoying for you and your friends, I reckon. What about the\nother girl, the one you decoyed away over a week ago?\"\n\n\"She's there too,\" said the Russian sullenly.\n\n\"That's good,\" said Julius. \"Isn't it all panning out beautifully? And a\nlovely night for the run!\"\n\n\"What run?\" demanded Kramenin, with a stare.\n\n\"Down to Gatehouse, sure. I hope you're fond of motoring?\"\n\n\"What do you mean? I refuse to go.\"\n\n\"Now don't get mad. You must see I'm not such a kid as to leave you\nhere. You'd ring up your friends on that telephone first thing! Ah!\" He\nobserved the fall on the other's face. \"You see, you'd got it all fixed.\nNo, sir, you're coming along with me. This your bedroom next door here?\nWalk right in. Little Willie and I will come behind. Put on a thick\ncoat, that's right. Fur lined? And you a Socialist! Now we're ready. We\nwalk downstairs and out through the hall to where my car's waiting.", "And\ndon't you forget I've got you covered every inch of the way. I can shoot\njust as well through my coat pocket. One word, or a glance even, at one\nof those liveried menials, and there'll sure be a strange face in the\nSulphur and Brimstone Works!\"\n\nTogether they descended the stairs, and passed out to the waiting car.\nThe Russian was shaking with rage. The hotel servants surrounded them.\nA cry hovered on his lips, but at the last minute his nerve failed him.\nThe American was a man of his word.\n\nWhen they reached the car, Julius breathed a sigh of relief. The\ndanger-zone was passed. Fear had successfully hypnotized the man by his\nside.\n\n\"Get in,\" he ordered. Then as he caught the other's sidelong glance,\n\"No, the chauffeur won't help you any. Naval man. Was on a submarine in\nRussia when the Revolution broke out. A brother of his was murdered by\nyour people. George!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir?\" The chauffeur turned his head.\n\n\"This gentleman is a Russian Bolshevik. We don't want to shoot him, but\nit may be necessary. You understand?\"\n\n\"Perfectly, sir.\"\n\n\"I want to go to Gatehouse in Kent. Know the road at all?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, it will be about an hour and a half's run.\"\n\n\"Make it an hour. I'm in a hurry.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best, sir.\" The car shot forward through the traffic.\n\nJulius ensconced himself comfortably by the side of his victim. He kept\nhis hand in the pocket of his coat, but his manner was urbane to the\nlast degree.\n\n\"There was a man I shot once in Arizona----\" he began cheerfully.\n\nAt the end of the hour's run the unfortunate Kramenin was more dead than\nalive. In succession to the anecdote of the Arizona man, there had been\na tough from 'Frisco, and an episode in the Rockies. Julius's narrative\nstyle, if not strictly accurate, was picturesque!\n\nSlowing down, the chauffeur called over his shoulder that they were just\ncoming into Gatehouse. Julius bade the Russian direct them. His plan was\nto drive straight up to the house.", "There Kramenin was to ask for the two\ngirls. Julius explained to him that Little Willie would not be tolerant\nof failure. Kramenin, by this time, was as putty in the other's hands.\nThe terrific pace they had come had still further unmanned him. He had\ngiven himself up for dead at every corner.\n\nThe car swept up the drive, and stopped before the porch. The chauffeur\nlooked round for orders.\n\n\"Turn the car first, George. Then ring the bell, and get back to your\nplace. Keep the engine going, and be ready to scoot like hell when I\ngive the word.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\nThe front door was opened by the butler. Kramenin felt the muzzle of the\nrevolver pressed against his ribs.\n\n\"Now,\" hissed Julius. \"And be careful.\"\n\nThe Russian beckoned. His lips were white, and his voice was not very\nsteady:\n\n\"It is I--Kramenin! Bring down the girl at once! There is no time to\nlose!\"\n\nWhittington had come down the steps. He uttered an exclamation of\nastonishment at seeing the other.\n\n\"You! What's up? Surely you know the plan----\"\n\nKramenin interrupted him, using the words that have created many\nunnecessary panics:\n\n\"We have been betrayed! Plans must be abandoned. We must save our own\nskins. The girl! And at once! It's our only chance.\"\n\nWhittington hesitated, but for hardly a moment.\n\n\"You have orders--from _him?_\"\n\n\"Naturally! Should I be here otherwise? Hurry! There is no time to be\nlost. The other little fool had better come too.\"\n\nWhittington turned and ran back into the house. The agonizing minutes\nwent by. Then--two figures hastily huddled in cloaks appeared on the\nsteps and were hustled into the car. The smaller of the two was inclined\nto resist and Whittington shoved her in unceremoniously. Julius leaned\nforward, and in doing so the light from the open door lit up his face.\nAnother man on the steps behind Whittington gave a startled exclamation.\nConcealment was at an end.\n\n\"Get a move on, George,\" shouted Julius.\n\nThe chauffeur slipped in his clutch, and with a bound the car started.", "The man on the steps uttered an oath. His hand went to his pocket. There\nwas a flash and a report. The bullet just missed the taller girl by an\ninch.\n\n\"Get down, Jane,\" cried Julius. \"Flat on the bottom of the car.\" He\nthrust her sharply forward, then standing up, he took careful aim and\nfired.\n\n\"Have you hit him?\" cried Tuppence eagerly.\n\n\"Sure,\" replied Julius. \"He isn't killed, though. Skunks like that take\na lot of killing. Are you all right, Tuppence?\"\n\n\"Of course I am. Where's Tommy? And who's this?\" She indicated the\nshivering Kramenin.\n\n\"Tommy's making tracks for the Argentine. I guess he thought you'd\nturned up your toes. Steady through the gate, George! That's right.\nIt'll take 'em at least five minutes to get busy after us. They'll use\nthe telephone, I guess, so look out for snares ahead--and don't take the\ndirect route. Who's this, did you say, Tuppence? Let me present Monsieur\nKramenin. I persuaded him to come on the trip for his health.\"\n\nThe Russian remained mute, still livid with terror.\n\n\"But what made them let us go?\" demanded Tuppence suspiciously.\n\n\"I reckon Monsieur Kramenin here asked them so prettily they just\ncouldn't refuse!\"\n\nThis was too much for the Russian. He burst out vehemently:\n\n\"Curse you--curse you! They know now that I betrayed them. My life won't\nbe safe for an hour in this country.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" assented Julius. \"I'd advise you to make tracks for Russia\nright away.\"\n\n\"Let me go, then,\" cried the other. \"I have done what you asked. Why do\nyou still keep me with you?\"\n\n\"Not for the pleasure of your company. I guess you can get right off now\nif you want to. I thought you'd rather I tooled you back to London.\"\n\n\"You may never reach London,\" snarled the other. \"Let me go here and\nnow.\"\n\n\"Sure thing. Pull up, George. The gentleman's not making the return\ntrip. If I ever come to Russia, Monsieur Kramenin, I shall expect a\nrousing welcome, and----\"\n\nBut before Julius had finished his speech, and before the car had\nfinally halted, the Russian had swung himself out and disappeared into\nthe night.", "\"Just a mite impatient to leave us,\" commented Julius, as the car\ngathered way again. \"And no idea of saying good-bye politely to the\nladies. Say, Jane, you can get up on the seat now.\"\n\nFor the first time the girl spoke.\n\n\"How did you 'persuade' him?\" she asked.\n\nJulius tapped his revolver.\n\n\"Little Willie here takes the credit!\"\n\n\"Splendid!\" cried the girl. The colour surged into her face, her eyes\nlooked admiringly at Julius.\n\n\"Annette and I didn't know what was going to happen to us,\" said\nTuppence. \"Old Whittington hurried us off. _We_ thought it was lambs to\nthe slaughter.\"\n\n\"Annette,\" said Julius. \"Is that what you call her?\"\n\nHis mind seemed to be trying to adjust itself to a new idea.\n\n\"It's her name,\" said Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide.\n\n\"Shucks!\" retorted Julius. \"She may think it's her name, because her\nmemory's gone, poor kid. But it's the one real and original Jane Finn\nwe've got here.\"\n\n\"What?\" cried Tuppence.\n\nBut she was interrupted. With an angry spurt, a bullet embedded itself\nin the upholstery of the car just behind her head.\n\n\"Down with you,\" cried Julius. \"It's an ambush. These guys have got busy\npretty quickly. Push her a bit, George.\"\n\nThe car fairly leapt forward. Three more shots rang out, but went\nhappily wide. Julius, upright, leant over the back of the car.\n\n\"Nothing to shoot at,\" he announced gloomily. \"But I guess there'll be\nanother little picnic soon. Ah!\"\n\nHe raised his hand to his cheek.\n\n\"You are hurt?\" said Annette quickly.\n\n\"Only a scratch.\"\n\nThe girl sprang to her feet.\n\n\"Let me out! Let me out, I say! Stop the car. It is me they're after.\nI'm the one they want. You shall not lose your lives because of me. Let\nme go.\" She was fumbling with the fastenings of the door.\n\nJulius took her by both arms, and looked at her. She had spoken with no\ntrace of foreign accent.\n\n\"Sit down, kid,\" he said gently. \"I guess there's nothing wrong with\nyour memory. Been fooling them all the time, eh?\"", "The girl looked at him, nodded, and then suddenly burst into tears.\nJulius patted her on the shoulder.\n\n\"There, there--just you sit tight. We're not going to let you quit.\"\n\nThrough her sobs the girl said indistinctly:\n\n\"You're from home. I can tell by your voice. It makes me home-sick.\"\n\n\"Sure I'm from home. I'm your cousin--Julius Hersheimmer. I came over to\nEurope on purpose to find you--and a pretty dance you've led me.\"\n\nThe car slackened speed. George spoke over his shoulder:\n\n\"Cross-roads here, sir. I'm not sure of the way.\"\n\nThe car slowed down till it hardly moved. As it did so a figure climbed\nsuddenly over the back, and plunged head first into the midst of them.\n\n\"Sorry,\" said Tommy, extricating himself.\n\nA mass of confused exclamations greeted him. He replied to them\nseverally:\n\n\"Was in the bushes by the drive. Hung on behind. Couldn't let you know\nbefore at the pace you were going. It was all I could do to hang on. Now\nthen, you girls, get out!\"\n\n\"Get out?\"\n\n\"Yes. There's a station just up that road. Train due in three minutes.\nYou'll catch it if you hurry.\"\n\n\"What the devil are you driving at?\" demanded Julius. \"Do you think you\ncan fool them by leaving the car?\"\n\n\"You and I aren't going to leave the car. Only the girls.\"\n\n\"You're crazed, Beresford. Stark staring mad! You can't let those girls\ngo off alone. It'll be the end of it if you do.\"\n\nTommy turned to Tuppence.\n\n\"Get out at once, Tuppence. Take her with you, and do just as I say.\nNo one will do you any harm. You're safe. Take the train to London. Go\nstraight to Sir James Peel Edgerton. Mr. Carter lives out of town, but\nyou'll be safe with him.\"\n\n\"Darn you!\" cried Julius. \"You're mad. Jane, you stay where you are.\"\n\nWith a sudden swift movement, Tommy snatched the revolver from Julius's\nhand, and levelled it at him.\n\n\"Now will you believe I'm in earnest? Get out, both of you, and do as I\nsay--or I'll shoot!\"", "Tuppence sprang out, dragging the unwilling Jane after her.\n\n\"Come on, it's all right. If Tommy's sure--he's sure. Be quick. We'll\nmiss the train.\"\n\nThey started running.\n\nJulius's pent-up rage burst forth.\n\n\"What the hell----\"\n\nTommy interrupted him.\n\n\"Dry up! I want a few words with you, Mr. Julius Hersheimmer.\"\n\nHER arm through Jane's, dragging her along, Tuppence reached the\nstation. Her quick ears caught the sound of the approaching train.\n\n\"Hurry up,\" she panted, \"or we'll miss it.\"\n\nThey arrived on the platform just as the train came to a standstill.\nTuppence opened the door of an empty first-class compartment, and the\ntwo girls sank down breathless on the padded seats.\n\nA man looked in, then passed on to the next carriage. Jane started\nnervously. Her eyes dilated with terror. She looked questioningly at\nTuppence.\n\n\"Is he one of them, do you think?\" she breathed.\n\nTuppence shook her head.\n\n\"No, no. It's all right.\" She took Jane's hand in hers. \"Tommy wouldn't\nhave told us to do this unless he was sure we'd be all right.\"\n\n\"But he doesn't know them as I do!\" The girl shivered. \"You can't\nunderstand. Five years! Five long years! Sometimes I thought I should go\nmad.\"\n\n\"Never mind. It's all over.\"\n\n\"Is it?\"\n\nThe train was moving now, speeding through the night at a gradually\nincreasing rate. Suddenly Jane Finn started up.\n\n\"What was that? I thought I saw a face--looking in through the window.\"\n\n\"No, there's nothing. See.\" Tuppence went to the window, and lifting the\nstrap let the pane down.\n\n\"You're sure?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.\"\n\nThe other seemed to feel some excuse was necessary:\n\n\"I guess I'm acting like a frightened rabbit, but I can't help it. If\nthey caught me now they'd----\" Her eyes opened wide and staring.\n\n\"_Don't!_\" implored Tuppence. \"Lie back, and _don't think_. You can be\nquite sure that Tommy wouldn't have said it was safe if it wasn't.\"\n\n\"My cousin didn't think so. He didn't want us to do this.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Tuppence, rather embarrassed.\n\n\"What are you thinking of?\" said Jane sharply.", "\"Why?\"\n\n\"Your voice was so--queer!\"\n\n\"I _was_ thinking of something,\" confessed Tuppence. \"But I don't want\nto tell you--not now. I may be wrong, but I don't think so. It's just\nan idea that came into my head a long time ago. Tommy's got it too--I'm\nalmost sure he has. But don't _you_ worry--there'll be time enough for\nthat later. And it mayn't be so at all! Do what I tell you--lie back and\ndon't think of anything.\"\n\n\"I'll try.\" The long lashes drooped over the hazel eyes.\n\nTuppence, for her part, sat bolt upright--much in the attitude of a\nwatchful terrier on guard. In spite of herself she was nervous. Her eyes\nflashed continually from one window to the other. She noted the exact\nposition of the communication cord. What it was that she feared, she\nwould have been hard put to it to say. But in her own mind she was\nfar from feeling the confidence displayed in her words. Not that she\ndisbelieved in Tommy, but occasionally she was shaken with doubts as to\nwhether anyone so simple and honest as he was could ever be a match for\nthe fiendish subtlety of the arch-criminal.\n\nIf they once reached Sir James Peel Edgerton in safety, all would be\nwell. But would they reach him? Would not the silent forces of Mr. Brown\nalready be assembling against them? Even that last picture of Tommy,\nrevolver in hand, failed to comfort her. By now he might be overpowered,\nborne down by sheer force of numbers.... Tuppence mapped out her plan of\ncampaign.\n\nAs the train at length drew slowly into Charing Cross, Jane Finn sat up\nwith a start.\n\n\"Have we arrived? I never thought we should!\"\n\n\"Oh, I thought we'd get to London all right. If there's going to be any\nfun, now is when it will begin. Quick, get out. We'll nip into a taxi.\"\n\nIn another minute they were passing the barrier, had paid the necessary\nfares, and were stepping into a taxi.\n\n\"King's Cross,\" directed Tuppence. Then she gave a jump.", "A man looked in\nat the window, just as they started. She was almost certain it was the\nsame man who had got into the carriage next to them. She had a horrible\nfeeling of being slowly hemmed in on every side.\n\n\"You see,\" she explained to Jane, \"if they think we're going to Sir\nJames, this will put them off the scent. Now they'll imagine we're going\nto Mr. Carter. His country place is north of London somewhere.\"\n\nCrossing Holborn there was a block, and the taxi was held up. This was\nwhat Tuppence had been waiting for.\n\n\"Quick,\" she whispered. \"Open the right-hand door!\"\n\nThe two girls stepped out into the traffic. Two minutes later they were\nseated in another taxi and were retracing their steps, this time direct\nto Carlton House Terrace.\n\n\"There,\" said Tuppence, with great satisfaction, \"this ought to do them.\nI can't help thinking that I'm really rather clever! How that other taxi\nman will swear! But I took his number, and I'll send him a postal order\nto-morrow, so that he won't lose by it if he happens to be genuine.\nWhat's this thing swerving----Oh!\"\n\nThere was a grinding noise and a bump. Another taxi had collided with\nthem.\n\nIn a flash Tuppence was out on the pavement. A policeman was\napproaching. Before he arrived Tuppence had handed the driver five\nshillings, and she and Jane had merged themselves in the crowd.\n\n\"It's only a step or two now,\" said Tuppence breathlessly. The accident\nhad taken place in Trafalgar Square.\n\n\"Do you think the collision was an accident, or done deliberately?\"\n\n\"I don't know. It might have been either.\"\n\nHand-in-hand, the two girls hurried along.\n\n\"It may be my fancy,\" said Tuppence suddenly, \"but I feel as though\nthere was some one behind us.\"\n\n\"Hurry!\" murmured the other. \"Oh, hurry!\"\n\nThey were now at the corner of Carlton House Terrace, and their spirits\nlightened. Suddenly a large and apparently intoxicated man barred their\nway.\n\n\"Good evening, ladies,\" he hiccupped. \"Whither away so fast?\"\n\n\"Let us pass, please,\" said Tuppence imperiously.", "\"Just a word with your pretty friend here.\" He stretched out an unsteady\nhand, and clutched Jane by the shoulder. Tuppence heard other footsteps\nbehind. She did not pause to ascertain whether they were friends or\nfoes. Lowering her head, she repeated a manoeuvre of childish days,\nand butted their aggressor full in the capacious middle. The success of\nthese unsportsmanlike tactics was immediate. The man sat down abruptly\non the pavement. Tuppence and Jane took to their heels. The house they\nsought was some way down. Other footsteps echoed behind them. Their\nbreath was coming in choking gasps as they reached Sir James's door.\nTuppence seized the bell and Jane the knocker.\n\nThe man who had stopped them reached the foot of the steps. For a moment\nhe hesitated, and as he did so the door opened. They fell into the hall\ntogether. Sir James came forward from the library door.\n\n\"Hullo! What's this?\"\n\nHe stepped forward, and put his arm round Jane as she swayed\nuncertainly. He half carried her into the library, and laid her on the\nleather couch. From a tantalus on the table he poured out a few drops of\nbrandy, and forced her to drink them. With a sigh she sat up, her eyes\nstill wild and frightened.\n\n\"It's all right. Don't be afraid, my child. You're quite safe.\"\n\nHer breath came more normally, and the colour was returning to her\ncheeks. Sir James looked at Tuppence quizzically.\n\n\"So you're not dead, Miss Tuppence, any more than that Tommy boy of\nyours was!\"\n\n\"The Young Adventurers take a lot of killing,\" boasted Tuppence.\n\n\"So it seems,\" said Sir James dryly. \"Am I right in thinking that the\njoint venture has ended in success, and that this\"--he turned to the\ngirl on the couch--\"is Miss Jane Finn?\"\n\nJane sat up.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said quietly, \"I am Jane Finn. I have a lot to tell you.\"\n\n\"When you are stronger----\"\n\n\"No--now!\" Her voice rose a little. \"I shall feel safer when I have told\neverything.\"\n\n\"As you please,\" said the lawyer.\n\nHe sat down in one of the big arm-chairs facing the couch.", "In a low\nvoice Jane began her story.\n\n\"I came over on the _Lusitania_ to take up a post in Paris. I was\nfearfully keen about the war, and just dying to help somehow or other. I\nhad been studying French, and my teacher said they were wanting help in\na hospital in Paris, so I wrote and offered my services, and they were\naccepted. I hadn't got any folk of my own, so it made it easy to arrange\nthings.\n\n\"When the _Lusitania_ was torpedoed, a man came up to me. I'd noticed\nhim more than once--and I'd figured it out in my own mind that he\nwas afraid of somebody or something. He asked me if I was a patriotic\nAmerican, and told me he was carrying papers which were just life or\ndeath to the Allies. He asked me to take charge of them. I was to watch\nfor an advertisement in the _Times_. If it didn't appear, I was to take\nthem to the American Ambassador.\n\n\"Most of what followed seems like a nightmare still. I see it in my\ndreams sometimes.... I'll hurry over that part. Mr. Danvers had told me\nto watch out. He might have been shadowed from New York, but he didn't\nthink so. At first I had no suspicions, but on the boat to Holyhead I\nbegan to get uneasy. There was one woman who had been very keen to look\nafter me, and chum up with me generally--a Mrs. Vandemeyer. At first I'd\nbeen only grateful to her for being so kind to me; but all the time I\nfelt there was something about her I didn't like, and on the Irish\nboat I saw her talking to some queer-looking men, and from the way they\nlooked I saw that they were talking about me. I remembered that she'd\nbeen quite near me on the _Lusitania_ when Mr. Danvers gave me the\npacket, and before that she'd tried to talk to him once or twice. I\nbegan to get scared, but I didn't quite see what to do.", "\"I had a wild idea of stopping at Holyhead, and not going on to London\nthat day, but I soon saw that that would be plumb foolishness. The only\nthing was to act as though I'd noticed nothing, and hope for the best.\nI couldn't see how they could get me if I was on my guard. One thing\nI'd done already as a precaution--ripped open the oilskin packet and\nsubstituted blank paper, and then sewn it up again. So, if anyone did\nmanage to rob me of it, it wouldn't matter.\n\n\"What to do with the real thing worried me no end. Finally I opened it\nout flat--there were only two sheets--and laid it between two of the\nadvertisement pages of a magazine. I stuck the two pages together\nround the edge with some gum off an envelope. I carried the magazine\ncarelessly stuffed into the pocket of my ulster.\n\n\"At Holyhead I tried to get into a carriage with people that looked all\nright, but in a queer way there seemed always to be a crowd round me\nshoving and pushing me just the way I didn't want to go. There was\nsomething uncanny and frightening about it. In the end I found myself in\na carriage with Mrs. Vandemeyer after all. I went out into the corridor,\nbut all the other carriages were full, so I had to go back and sit down.\nI consoled myself with the thought that there were other people in the\ncarriage--there was quite a nice-looking man and his wife sitting just\nopposite. So I felt almost happy about it until just outside London. I\nhad leaned back and closed my eyes. I guess they thought I was asleep,\nbut my eyes weren't quite shut, and suddenly I saw the nice-looking man\nget something out of his bag and hand it to Mrs. Vandemeyer, and as he\ndid so he _winked_....\n\n\"I can't tell you how that wink sort of froze me through and through. My\nonly thought was to get out in the corridor as quick as ever I could.", "I\ngot up, trying to look natural and easy. Perhaps they saw something--I\ndon't know--but suddenly Mrs. Vandemeyer said 'Now,' and flung something\nover my nose and mouth as I tried to scream. At the same moment I felt a\nterrific blow on the back of my head....\"\n\nShe shuddered. Sir James murmured something sympathetically. In a minute\nshe resumed:\n\n\"I don't know how long it was before I came back to consciousness. I\nfelt very ill and sick. I was lying on a dirty bed. There was a\nscreen round it, but I could hear two people talking in the room. Mrs.\nVandemeyer was one of them. I tried to listen, but at first I couldn't\ntake much in. When at last I did begin to grasp what was going on--I was\njust terrified! I wonder I didn't scream right out there and then.\n\n\"They hadn't found the papers. They'd got the oilskin packet with the\nblanks, and they were just mad! They didn't know whether _I_'d changed\nthe papers, or whether Danvers had been carrying a dummy message,\nwhile the real one was sent another way. They spoke of\"--she closed her\neyes--\"torturing me to find out!\n\n\"I'd never known what fear--really sickening fear--was before! Once\nthey came to look at me. I shut my eyes and pretended to be still\nunconscious, but I was afraid they'd hear the beating of my heart.\nHowever, they went away again. I began thinking madly. What could I do?\nI knew I wouldn't be able to stand up against torture very long.\n\n\"Suddenly something put the thought of loss of memory into my head. The\nsubject had always interested me, and I'd read an awful lot about it.\nI had the whole thing at my finger-tips. If only I could succeed in\ncarrying the bluff through, it might save me. I said a prayer, and drew\na long breath. Then I opened my eyes and started babbling in _French!_\n\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer came round the screen at once. Her face was so wicked I\nnearly died, but I smiled up at her doubtfully, and asked her in French\nwhere I was.", "\"It puzzled her, I could see. She called the man she had been talking\nto. He stood by the screen with his face in shadow. He spoke to me in\nFrench. His voice was very ordinary and quiet, but somehow, I don't know\nwhy, he scared me worse than the woman. I felt he'd seen right through\nme, but I went on playing my part. I asked again where I was, and\nthen went on that there was something I _must_ remember--_must_\nremember--only for the moment it was all gone. I worked myself up to\nbe more and more distressed. He asked me my name. I said I didn't\nknow--that I couldn't remember anything at all.\n\n\"Suddenly he caught my wrist, and began twisting it. The pain was awful.\nI screamed. He went on. I screamed and screamed, but I managed to shriek\nout things in French. I don't know how long I could have gone on, but\nluckily I fainted. The last thing I heard was his voice saying: 'That's\nnot bluff! Anyway, a kid of her age wouldn't know enough.' I guess he\nforgot American girls are older for their age than English ones, and\ntake more interest in scientific subjects.\n\n\"When I came to, Mrs. Vandemeyer was sweet as honey to me. She'd had her\norders, I guess. She spoke to me in French--told me I'd had a shock\nand been very ill. I should be better soon. I pretended to be rather\ndazed--murmured something about the 'doctor' having hurt my wrist. She\nlooked relieved when I said that.\n\n\"By and by she went out of the room altogether. I was suspicious still,\nand lay quite quiet for some time. In the end, however, I got up and\nwalked round the room, examining it. I thought that even if anyone\n_was_ watching me from somewhere, it would seem natural enough under\nthe circumstances. It was a squalid, dirty place. There were no windows,\nwhich seemed queer. I guessed the door would be locked, but I didn't\ntry it. There were some battered old pictures on the walls, representing\nscenes from _Faust_.\"", "Jane's two listeners gave a simultaneous \"Ah!\" The girl nodded.\n\n\"Yes--it was the place in Soho where Mr. Beresford was imprisoned. Of\ncourse, at the time I didn't even know if I was in London. One thing was\nworrying me dreadfully, but my heart gave a great throb of relief when\nI saw my ulster lying carelessly over the back of a chair. _And the\nmagazine was still rolled up in the pocket!_\n\n\"If only I could be certain that I was not being overlooked! I looked\ncarefully round the walls. There didn't seem to be a peep-hole of any\nkind--nevertheless I felt kind of sure there must be. All of a sudden I\nsat down on the edge of the table, and put my face in my hands, sobbing\nout a 'Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!' I've got very sharp ears. I distinctly heard\nthe rustle of a dress, and slight creak. That was enough for me. I was\nbeing watched!\n\n\"I lay down on the bed again, and by and by Mrs. Vandemeyer brought me\nsome supper. She was still sweet as they make them. I guess she'd been\ntold to win my confidence. Presently she produced the oilskin packet,\nand asked me if I recognized it, watching me like a lynx all the time.\n\n\"I took it and turned it over in a puzzled sort of way. Then I shook my\nhead. I said that I felt I _ought_ to remember something about it, that\nit was just as though it was all coming back, and then, before I could\nget hold of it, it went again. Then she told me that I was her niece,\nand that I was to call her 'Aunt Rita.' I did obediently, and she told\nme not to worry--my memory would soon come back.\n\n\"That was an awful night. I'd made my plan whilst I was waiting for her.\nThe papers were safe so far, but I couldn't take the risk of leaving\nthem there any longer. They might throw that magazine away any minute.\nI lay awake waiting until I judged it must be about two o'clock in the\nmorning.", "Then I got up as softly as I could, and felt in the dark along\nthe left-hand wall. Very gently, I unhooked one of the pictures from its\nnail--Marguerite with her casket of jewels. I crept over to my coat and\ntook out the magazine, and an odd envelope or two that I had shoved in.\nThen I went to the washstand, and damped the brown paper at the back\nof the picture all round. Presently I was able to pull it away. I had\nalready torn out the two stuck-together pages from the magazine, and now\nI slipped them with their precious enclosure between the picture and its\nbrown paper backing. A little gum from the envelopes helped me to\nstick the latter up again. No one would dream the picture had ever been\ntampered with. I rehung it on the wall, put the magazine back in my\ncoat pocket, and crept back to bed. I was pleased with my hiding-place.\nThey'd never think of pulling to pieces one of their own pictures. I\nhoped that they'd come to the conclusion that Danvers had been carrying\na dummy all along, and that, in the end, they'd let me go.\n\n\"As a matter of fact, I guess that's what they did think at first, and,\nin a way, it was dangerous for me. I learnt afterwards that they nearly\ndid away with me then and there--there was never much chance of their\n'letting me go'--but the first man, who was the boss, preferred to keep\nme alive on the chance of my having hidden them, and being able to tell\nwhere if I recovered my memory. They watched me constantly for weeks.\nSometimes they'd ask me questions by the hour--I guess there was nothing\nthey didn't know about the third degree!--but somehow I managed to hold\nmy own. The strain of it was awful, though....\n\n\"They took me back to Ireland, and over every step of the journey again,\nin case I'd hidden it somewhere _en route_. Mrs. Vandemeyer and another\nwoman never left me for a moment.", "They spoke of me as a young relative\nof Mrs. Vandemeyer's whose mind was affected by the shock of the\n_Lusitania_. There was no one I could appeal to for help without\ngiving myself away to _them_, and if I risked it and failed--and Mrs.\nVandemeyer looked so rich, and so beautifully dressed, that I felt\nconvinced they'd take her word against mine, and think it was part of my\nmental trouble to think myself 'persecuted'--I felt that the horrors in\nstore for me would be too awful once they knew I'd been only shamming.\"\n\nSir James nodded comprehendingly.\n\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer was a woman of great personality. With that and her\nsocial position she would have had little difficulty in imposing her\npoint of view in preference to yours. Your sensational accusations\nagainst her would not easily have found credence.\"\n\n\"That's what I thought. It ended in my being sent to a sanatorium at\nBournemouth. I couldn't make up my mind at first whether it was a sham\naffair or genuine. A hospital nurse had charge of me. I was a special\npatient. She seemed so nice and normal that at last I determined to\nconfide in her. A merciful providence just saved me in time from falling\ninto the trap. My door happened to be ajar, and I heard her talking to\nsome one in the passage. _She was one of them!_ They still fancied it\nmight be a bluff on my part, and she was put in charge of me to make\nsure! After that, my nerve went completely. I dared trust nobody.\n\n\"I think I almost hypnotized myself. After a while, I almost forgot\nthat I was really Jane Finn. I was so bent on playing the part of Janet\nVandemeyer that my nerves began to play me tricks. I became really\nill--for months I sank into a sort of stupor. I felt sure I should\ndie soon, and that nothing really mattered. A sane person shut up in a\nlunatic asylum often ends by becoming insane, they say. I guess I was\nlike that.", "Playing my part had become second nature to me. I wasn't even\nunhappy in the end--just apathetic. Nothing seemed to matter. And the\nyears went on.\n\n\"And then suddenly things seemed to change. Mrs. Vandemeyer came down\nfrom London. She and the doctor asked me questions, experimented with\nvarious treatments. There was some talk of sending me to a specialist in\nParis. In the end, they did not dare risk it. I overheard something that\nseemed to show that other people--friends--were looking for me. I\nlearnt later that the nurse who had looked after me went to Paris,\nand consulted a specialist, representing herself to be me. He put her\nthrough some searching tests, and exposed her loss of memory to be\nfraudulent; but she had taken a note of his methods and reproduced\nthem on me. I dare say I couldn't have deceived the specialist for a\nminute--a man who has made a lifelong study of a thing is unique--but\nI managed once again to hold my own with them. The fact that I'd not\nthought of myself as Jane Finn for so long made it easier.\n\n\"One night I was whisked off to London at a moment's notice. They took\nme back to the house in Soho. Once I got away from the sanatorium I felt\ndifferent--as though something in me that had been buried for a long\ntime was waking up again.\n\n\"They sent me in to wait on Mr. Beresford. (Of course I didn't know\nhis name then.) I was suspicious--I thought it was another trap. But he\nlooked so honest, I could hardly believe it. However, I was careful in\nall I said, for I knew we could be overheard. There's a small hole, high\nup in the wall.\n\n\"But on the Sunday afternoon a message was brought to the house. They\nwere all very disturbed. Without their knowing, I listened. Word had\ncome that he was to be killed. I needn't tell the next part, because\nyou know it. I thought I'd have time to rush up and get the papers from\ntheir hiding-place, but I was caught.", "So I screamed out that he was\nescaping, and I said I wanted to go back to Marguerite. I shouted the\nname three times very loud. I knew the others would think I meant\nMrs. Vandemeyer, but I hoped it might make Mr. Beresford think of the\npicture. He'd unhooked one the first day--that's what made me hesitate\nto trust him.\"\n\nShe paused.\n\n\"Then the papers,\" said Sir James slowly, \"are still at the back of the\npicture in that room.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" The girl had sunk back on the sofa exhausted with the strain of\nthe long story.\n\nSir James rose to his feet. He looked at his watch.\n\n\"Come,\" he said, \"we must go at once.\"\n\n\"To-night?\" queried Tuppence, surprised.\n\n\"To-morrow may be too late,\" said Sir James gravely. \"Besides, by\ngoing to-night we have the chance of capturing that great man and\nsuper-criminal--Mr. Brown!\"\n\nThere was dead silence, and Sir James continued:\n\n\"You have been followed here--not a doubt of it. When we leave the house\nwe shall be followed again, but not molested, _for it is Mr. Brown's\nplan that we are to lead him_. But the Soho house is under police\nsupervision night and day. There are several men watching it. When we\nenter that house, Mr. Brown will not draw back--he will risk all, on the\nchance of obtaining the spark to fire his mine. And he fancies the risk\nnot great--since he will enter in the guise of a friend!\"\n\nTuppence flushed, then opened her mouth impulsively.\n\n\"But there's something you don't know--that we haven't told you.\" Her\neyes dwelt on Jane in perplexity.\n\n\"What is that?\" asked the other sharply. \"No hesitations, Miss Tuppence.\nWe need to be sure of our going.\"\n\nBut Tuppence, for once, seemed tongue-tied.\n\n\"It's so difficult--you see, if I'm wrong--oh, it would be dreadful.\"\n She made a grimace at the unconscious Jane. \"Never forgive me,\" she\nobserved cryptically.\n\n\"You want me to help you out, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes, please. _You_ know who Mr. Brown is, don't you?\"", "\"Yes,\" said Sir James gravely. \"At last I do.\"\n\n\"At last?\" queried Tuppence doubtfully. \"Oh, but I thought----\" She\npaused.\n\n\"You thought correctly, Miss Tuppence. I have been morally certain of\nhis identity for some time--ever since the night of Mrs. Vandemeyer's\nmysterious death.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" breathed Tuppence.\n\n\"For there we are up against the logic of facts. There are only two\nsolutions. Either the chloral was administered by her own hand, which\ntheory I reject utterly, or else----\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Or else it was administered in the brandy you gave her. Only three\npeople touched that brandy--you, Miss Tuppence, I myself, and one\nother--Mr. Julius Hersheimmer!\"\n\nJane Finn stirred and sat up, regarding the speaker with wide astonished\neyes.\n\n\"At first, the thing seemed utterly impossible. Mr. Hersheimmer, as the\nson of a prominent millionaire, was a well-known figure in America. It\nseemed utterly impossible that he and Mr. Brown could be one and the\nsame. But you cannot escape from the logic of facts. Since the thing\nwas so--it must be accepted. Remember Mrs. Vandemeyer's sudden and\ninexplicable agitation. Another proof, if proof was needed.\n\n\"I took an early opportunity of giving you a hint. From some words of\nMr. Hersheimmer's at Manchester, I gathered that you had understood and\nacted on that hint. Then I set to work to prove the impossible possible.\nMr. Beresford rang me up and told me, what I had already suspected,\nthat the photograph of Miss Jane Finn had never really been out of Mr.\nHersheimmer's possession----\"\n\nBut the girl interrupted. Springing to her feet, she cried out angrily:\n\n\"What do you mean? What are you trying to suggest? That Mr. Brown is\n_Julius?_ Julius--my own cousin!\"\n\n\"No, Miss Finn,\" said Sir James unexpectedly. \"Not your cousin. The man\nwho calls himself Julius Hersheimmer is no relation to you whatsoever.\"\n\nSIR James's words came like a bomb-shell. Both girls looked equally\npuzzled. The lawyer went across to his desk, and returned with a small\nnewspaper cutting, which he handed to Jane. Tuppence read it over\nher shoulder.", "Mr. Carter would have recognized it. It referred to the\nmysterious man found dead in New York.\n\n\"As I was saying to Miss Tuppence,\" resumed the lawyer, \"I set to work\nto prove the impossible possible. The great stumbling-block was the\nundeniable fact that Julius Hersheimmer was not an assumed name. When I\ncame across this paragraph my problem was solved. Julius Hersheimmer set\nout to discover what had become of his cousin. He went out West, where\nhe obtained news of her and her photograph to aid him in his search. On\nthe eve of his departure from New York he was set upon and murdered. His\nbody was dressed in shabby clothes, and the face disfigured to prevent\nidentification. Mr. Brown took his place. He sailed immediately for\nEngland. None of the real Hersheimmer's friends or intimates saw him\nbefore he sailed--though indeed it would hardly have mattered if they\nhad, the impersonation was so perfect. Since then he had been hand and\nglove with those sworn to hunt him down. Every secret of theirs has been\nknown to him. Only once did he come near disaster. Mrs. Vandemeyer knew\nhis secret. It was no part of his plan that that huge bribe should ever\nbe offered to her. But for Miss Tuppence's fortunate change of plan, she\nwould have been far away from the flat when we arrived there. Exposure\nstared him in the face. He took a desperate step, trusting in his\nassumed character to avert suspicion. He nearly succeeded--but not\nquite.\"\n\n\"I can't believe it,\" murmured Jane. \"He seemed so splendid.\"\n\n\"The real Julius Hersheimmer _was_ a splendid fellow! And Mr. Brown is\na consummate actor. But ask Miss Tuppence if she also has not had her\nsuspicions.\"\n\nJane turned mutely to Tuppence. The latter nodded.\n\n\"I didn't want to say it, Jane--I knew it would hurt you. And, after\nall, I couldn't be sure. I still don't understand why, if he's Mr.\nBrown, he rescued us.\"\n\n\"Was it Julius Hersheimmer who helped you to escape?\"\n\nTuppence recounted to Sir James the exciting events of the evening,\nending up: \"But I can't see _why!_\"\n\n\"Can't you?", "I can. So can young Beresford, by his actions. As a last\nhope Jane Finn was to be allowed to escape--and the escape must be\nmanaged so that she harbours no suspicions of its being a put-up job.\nThey're not averse to young Beresford's being in the neighbourhood, and,\nif necessary, communicating with you. They'll take care to get him out\nof the way at the right minute. Then Julius Hersheimmer dashes up and\nrescues you in true melodramatic style. Bullets fly--but don't hit\nanybody. What would have happened next? You would have driven straight\nto the house in Soho and secured the document which Miss Finn would\nprobably have entrusted to her cousin's keeping. Or, if he conducted the\nsearch, he would have pretended to find the hiding-place already rifled.\nHe would have had a dozen ways of dealing with the situation, but the\nresult would have been the same. And I rather fancy some accident would\nhave happened to both of you. You see, you know rather an inconvenient\namount. That's a rough outline. I admit I was caught napping; but\nsomebody else wasn't.\"\n\n\"Tommy,\" said Tuppence softly.\n\n\"Yes. Evidently when the right moment came to get rid of him--he was too\nsharp for them. All the same, I'm not too easy in my mind about him.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because Julius Hersheimmer is Mr. Brown,\" said Sir James dryly. \"And it\ntakes more than one man and a revolver to hold up Mr. Brown....\"\n\nTuppence paled a little.\n\n\"What can we do?\"\n\n\"Nothing until we've been to the house in Soho. If Beresford has still\ngot the upper hand, there's nothing to fear. If otherwise, our enemy\nwill come to find us, and he will not find us unprepared!\" From a drawer\nin the desk, he took a service revolver, and placed it in his coat\npocket.\n\n\"Now we're ready. I know better than even to suggest going without you,\nMiss Tuppence----\"\n\n\"I should think so indeed!\"\n\n\"But I do suggest that Miss Finn should remain here. She will be\nperfectly safe, and I am afraid she is absolutely worn out with all she\nhas been through.\"", "But to Tuppence's surprise Jane shook her head.\n\n\"No. I guess I'm going too. Those papers were my trust. I must go\nthrough with this business to the end. I'm heaps better now anyway.\"\n\nSir James's car was ordered round. During the short drive Tuppence's\nheart beat tumultuously. In spite of momentary qualms of uneasiness\nrespecting Tommy, she could not but feel exultation. They were going to\nwin!\n\nThe car drew up at the corner of the square and they got out. Sir James\nwent up to a plain-clothes man who was on duty with several others, and\nspoke to him. Then he rejoined the girls.\n\n\"No one has gone into the house so far. It is being watched at the back\nas well, so they are quite sure of that. Anyone who attempts to enter\nafter we have done so will be arrested immediately. Shall we go in?\"\n\nA policeman produced a key. They all knew Sir James well. They had also\nhad orders respecting Tuppence. Only the third member of the party was\nunknown to them. The three entered the house, pulling the door to behind\nthem. Slowly they mounted the rickety stairs. At the top was the ragged\ncurtain hiding the recess where Tommy had hidden that day. Tuppence had\nheard the story from Jane in her character of \"Annette.\" She looked at\nthe tattered velvet with interest. Even now she could almost swear it\nmoved--as though _some one_ was behind it. So strong was the illusion\nthat she almost fancied she could make out the outline of a form....\nSupposing Mr. Brown--Julius--was there waiting....\n\nImpossible of course! Yet she almost went back to put the curtain aside\nand make sure....\n\nNow they were entering the prison room. No place for anyone to hide\nhere, thought Tuppence, with a sigh of relief, then chided herself\nindignantly. She must not give way to this foolish fancying--this\ncurious insistent feeling that _Mr. Brown was in the house_.... Hark!\nwhat was that? A stealthy footstep on the stairs? There _was_ some one\nin the house!", "Absurd! She was becoming hysterical.\n\nJane had gone straight to the picture of Marguerite. She unhooked it\nwith a steady hand. The dust lay thick upon it, and festoons of cobwebs\nlay between it and the wall. Sir James handed her a pocket-knife, and\nshe ripped away the brown paper from the back.... The advertisement\npage of a magazine fell out. Jane picked it up. Holding apart the frayed\ninner edges she extracted two thin sheets covered with writing!\n\nNo dummy this time! The real thing!\n\n\"We've got it,\" said Tuppence. \"At last....\"\n\nThe moment was almost breathless in its emotion. Forgotten the faint\ncreakings, the imagined noises of a minute ago. None of them had eyes\nfor anything but what Jane held in her hand.\n\nSir James took it, and scrutinized it attentively.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said quietly, \"this is the ill-fated draft treaty!\"\n\n\"We've succeeded,\" said Tuppence. There was awe and an almost wondering\nunbelief in her voice.\n\nSir James echoed her words as he folded the paper carefully and put it\naway in his pocket-book, then he looked curiously round the dingy room.\n\n\"It was here that our young friend was confined for so long, was\nit not?\" he said. \"A truly sinister room. You notice the absence of\nwindows, and the thickness of the close-fitting door. Whatever took\nplace here would never be heard by the outside world.\"\n\nTuppence shivered. His words woke a vague alarm in her. What if there\n_was_ some one concealed in the house? Some one who might bar that door\non them, and leave them to die like rats in a trap? Then she realized\nthe absurdity of her thought. The house was surrounded by police who,\nif they failed to reappear, would not hesitate to break in and make a\nthorough search. She smiled at her own foolishness--then looked up with\na start to find Sir James watching her. He gave her an emphatic little\nnod.\n\n\"Quite right, Miss Tuppence. You scent danger. So do I. So does Miss\nFinn.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" admitted Jane. \"It's absurd--but I can't help it.\"", "Sir James nodded again.\n\n\"You feel--as we all feel-- _the presence of Mr. Bown_. Yes\"--as\nTuppence made a movement--\"not a doubt of it-- _Mr. Brown is here_....\"\n\n\"In this house?\"\n\n\"In this room.... You don't understand? _I am Mr. Brown_....\"\n\nStupefied, unbelieving, they stared at him. The very lines of his face\nhad changed. It was a different man who stood before them. He smiled a\nslow cruel smile.\n\n\"Neither of you will leave this room alive! You said just now we had\nsucceeded. _I_ have succeeded! The draft treaty is mine.\" His smile grew\nwider as he looked at Tuppence. \"Shall I tell you how it will be? Sooner\nor later the police will break in, and they will find three victims of\nMr. Brown--three, not two, you understand, but fortunately the third\nwill not be dead, only wounded, and will be able to describe the attack\nwith a wealth of detail! The treaty? It is in the hands of Mr. Brown. So\nno one will think of searching the pockets of Sir James Peel Edgerton!\"\n\nHe turned to Jane.\n\n\"You outwitted me. I make my acknowledgments. But you will not do it\nagain.\"\n\nThere was a faint sound behind him, but, intoxicated with success, he\ndid not turn his head.\n\nHe slipped his hand into his pocket.\n\n\"Checkmate to the Young Adventurers,\" he said, and slowly raised the big\nautomatic.\n\nBut, even as he did so, he felt himself seized from behind in a grip of\niron. The revolver was wrenched from his hand, and the voice of Julius\nHersheimmer said drawlingly:\n\n\"I guess you're caught redhanded with the goods upon you.\"\n\nThe blood rushed to the K.C.'s face, but his self-control was\nmarvellous, as he looked from one to the other of his two captors. He\nlooked longest at Tommy.\n\n\"You,\" he said beneath his breath. \"_You!_ I might have known.\"\n\nSeeing that he was disposed to offer no resistance, their grip\nslackened. Quick as a flash his left hand, the hand which bore the big\nsignet ring, was raised to his lips....\n\n\"'_Ave, Caesar!", "te morituri salutant_,'\" he said, still looking at\nTommy.\n\nThen his face changed, and with a long convulsive shudder he fell\nforward in a crumpled heap, whilst an odour of bitter almonds filled the\nair.\n\nTHE supper party given by Mr. Julius Hersheimmer to a few friends on the\nevening of the 30th will long be remembered in catering circles. It took\nplace in a private room, and Mr. Hersheimmer's orders were brief and\nforcible. He gave carte blanche--and when a millionaire gives carte\nblanche he usually gets it!\n\nEvery delicacy out of season was duly provided. Waiters carried bottles\nof ancient and royal vintage with loving care. The floral decorations\ndefied the seasons, and fruits of the earth as far apart as May and\nNovember found themselves miraculously side by side. The list of guests\nwas small and select. The American Ambassador, Mr. Carter, who had taken\nthe liberty, he said, of bringing an old friend, Sir William Beresford,\nwith him, Archdeacon Cowley, Dr. Hall, those two youthful adventurers,\nMiss Prudence Cowley and Mr. Thomas Beresford, and last, but not least,\nas guest of honour, Miss Jane Finn.\n\nJulius had spared no pains to make Jane's appearance a success. A\nmysterious knock had brought Tuppence to the door of the apartment she\nwas sharing with the American girl. It was Julius. In his hand he held a\ncheque.\n\n\"Say, Tuppence,\" he began, \"will you do me a good turn? Take this, and\nget Jane regularly togged up for this evening. You're all coming to\nsupper with me at the _Savoy_. See? Spare no expense. You get me?\"\n\n\"Sure thing,\" mimicked Tuppence. \"We shall enjoy ourselves. It will be a\npleasure dressing Jane. She's the loveliest thing I've ever seen.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" agreed Mr. Hersheimmer fervently.\n\nHis fervour brought a momentary twinkle to Tuppence's eye.\n\n\"By the way, Julius,\" she remarked demurely, \"I--haven't given you my\nanswer yet.\"\n\n\"Answer?\" said Julius. His face paled.\n\n\"You know--when you asked me to--marry you,\" faltered Tuppence, her\neyes downcast in the true manner of the early Victorian heroine, \"and\nwouldn't take no for an answer.", "I've thought it well over----\"\n\n\"Yes?\" said Julius. The perspiration stood on his forehead.\n\nTuppence relented suddenly.\n\n\"You great idiot!\" she said. \"What on earth induced you to do it? I\ncould see at the time you didn't care a twopenny dip for me!\"\n\n\"Not at all. I had--and still have--the highest sentiments of esteem and\nrespect--and admiration for you----\"\n\n\"H'm!\" said Tuppence. \"Those are the kind of sentiments that very soon\ngo to the wall when the other sentiment comes along! Don't they, old\nthing?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" said Julius stiffly, but a large and\nburning blush overspread his countenance.\n\n\"Shucks!\" retorted Tuppence. She laughed, and closed the door, reopening\nit to add with dignity: \"Morally, I shall always consider I have been\njilted!\"\n\n\"What was it?\" asked Jane as Tuppence rejoined her.\n\n\"Julius.\"\n\n\"What did he want?\"\n\n\"Really, I think, he wanted to see you, but I wasn't going to let him.\nNot until to-night, when you're going to burst upon every one like King\nSolomon in his glory! Come on! _We're going to shop!_\"\n\nTo most people the 29th, the much-heralded \"Labour Day,\" had passed much\nas any other day. Speeches were made in the Park and Trafalgar Square.\nStraggling processions, singing the _Red Flag_, wandered through the\nstreets in a more or less aimless manner. Newspapers which had hinted at\na general strike, and the inauguration of a reign of terror, were forced\nto hide their diminished heads. The bolder and more astute among\nthem sought to prove that peace had been effected by following their\ncounsels. In the Sunday papers a brief notice of the sudden death of Sir\nJames Peel Edgerton, the famous K.C., had appeared. Monday's paper\ndealt appreciatively with the dead man's career. The exact manner of his\nsudden death was never made public.\n\nTommy had been right in his forecast of the situation. It had been a\none-man show. Deprived of their chief, the organization fell to pieces.\nKramenin had made a precipitate return to Russia, leaving England early\non Sunday morning.", "The gang had fled from Astley Priors in a panic,\nleaving behind, in their haste, various damaging documents which\ncompromised them hopelessly. With these proofs of conspiracy in their\nhands, aided further by a small brown diary taken from the pocket of the\ndead man which had contained a full and damning resume of the whole\nplot, the Government had called an eleventh-hour conference. The Labour\nleaders were forced to recognize that they had been used as a cat's\npaw. Certain concessions were made by the Government, and were eagerly\naccepted. It was to be Peace, not War!\n\nBut the Cabinet knew by how narrow a margin they had escaped utter\ndisaster. And burnt in on Mr. Carter's brain was the strange scene which\nhad taken place in the house in Soho the night before.\n\nHe had entered the squalid room to find that great man, the friend of\na lifetime, dead--betrayed out of his own mouth. From the dead man's\npocket-book he had retrieved the ill-omened draft treaty, and then\nand there, in the presence of the other three, it had been reduced to\nashes.... England was saved!\n\nAnd now, on the evening of the 30th, in a private room at the _Savoy_,\nMr. Julius P. Hersheimmer was receiving his guests.\n\nMr. Carter was the first to arrive. With him was a choleric-looking old\ngentleman, at sight of whom Tommy flushed up to the roots of his hair.\nHe came forward.\n\n\"Ha!\" said the old gentleman, surveying him apoplectically. \"So you're\nmy nephew, are you? Not much to look at--but you've done good work, it\nseems. Your mother must have brought you up well after all. Shall we\nlet bygones be bygones, eh? You're my heir, you know; and in future I\npropose to make you an allowance--and you can look upon Chalmers Park as\nyour home.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir, it's awfully decent of you.\"\n\n\"Where's this young lady I've been hearing such a lot about?\"\n\nTommy introduced Tuppence.\n\n\"Ha!\" said Sir William, eyeing her. \"Girls aren't what they used to be\nin my young days.\"", "\"Yes, they are,\" said Tuppence. \"Their clothes are different, perhaps,\nbut they themselves are just the same.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps you're right. Minxes then--minxes now!\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said Tuppence. \"I'm a frightful minx myself.\"\n\n\"I believe you,\" said the old gentleman, chuckling, and pinched her ear\nin high good-humour. Most young women were terrified of the \"old bear,\"\n as they termed him. Tuppence's pertness delighted the old misogynist.\n\nThen came the timid archdeacon, a little bewildered by the company in\nwhich he found himself, glad that his daughter was considered to have\ndistinguished herself, but unable to help glancing at her from time\nto time with nervous apprehension. But Tuppence behaved admirably. She\nforbore to cross her legs, set a guard upon her tongue, and steadfastly\nrefused to smoke.\n\nDr. Hall came next, and he was followed by the American Ambassador.\n\n\"We might as well sit down,\" said Julius, when he had introduced all his\nguests to each other. \"Tuppence, will you----\"\n\nHe indicated the place of honour with a wave of his hand.\n\nBut Tuppence shook her head.\n\n\"No--that's Jane's place! When one thinks of how she's held out all\nthese years, she ought to be made the queen of the feast to-night.\"\n\nJulius flung her a grateful glance, and Jane came forward shyly to the\nallotted seat. Beautiful as she had seemed before, it was as nothing to\nthe loveliness that now went fully adorned. Tuppence had performed her\npart faithfully. The model gown supplied by a famous dressmaker had been\nentitled \"A tiger lily.\" It was all golds and reds and browns, and out\nof it rose the pure column of the girl's white throat, and the bronze\nmasses of hair that crowned her lovely head. There was admiration in\nevery eye, as she took her seat.\n\nSoon the supper party was in full swing, and with one accord Tommy was\ncalled upon for a full and complete explanation.\n\n\"You've been too darned close about the whole business,\" Julius accused\nhim. \"You let on to me that you were off to the Argentine--though I\nguess you had your reasons for that.", "The idea of both you and Tuppence\ncasting me for the part of Mr. Brown just tickles me to death!\"\n\n\"The idea was not original to them,\" said Mr. Carter gravely. \"It was\nsuggested, and the poison very carefully instilled, by a past-master in\nthe art. The paragraph in the New York paper suggested the plan to him,\nand by means of it he wove a web that nearly enmeshed you fatally.\"\n\n\"I never liked him,\" said Julius. \"I felt from the first that there was\nsomething wrong about him, and I always suspected that it was he who\nsilenced Mrs. Vandemeyer so appositely. But it wasn't till I heard that\nthe order for Tommy's execution came right on the heels of our interview\nwith him that Sunday that I began to tumble to the fact that he was the\nbig bug himself.\"\n\n\"I never suspected it at all,\" lamented Tuppence. \"I've always thought\nI was so much cleverer than Tommy--but he's undoubtedly scored over me\nhandsomely.\"\n\nJulius agreed.\n\n\"Tommy's been the goods this trip! And, instead of sitting there as dumb\nas a fish, let him banish his blushes, and tell us all about it.\"\n\n\"Hear! hear!\"\n\n\"There's nothing to tell,\" said Tommy, acutely uncomfortable. \"I was an\nawful mug--right up to the time I found that photograph of Annette, and\nrealized that she was Jane Finn. Then I remembered how persistently she\nhad shouted out that word 'Marguerite'--and I thought of the pictures,\nand--well, that's that. Then of course I went over the whole thing to\nsee where I'd made an ass of myself.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said Mr. Carter, as Tommy showed signs of taking refuge in\nsilence once more.\n\n\"That business about Mrs. Vandemeyer had worried me when Julius told me\nabout it. On the face of it, it seemed that he or Sir James must have\ndone the trick. But I didn't know which. Finding that photograph in the\ndrawer, after that story of how it had been got from him by Inspector\nBrown, made me suspect Julius. Then I remembered that it was Sir James\nwho had discovered the false Jane Finn.", "In the end, I couldn't make up\nmy mind--and just decided to take no chances either way. I left a note\nfor Julius, in case he was Mr. Brown, saying I was off to the Argentine,\nand I dropped Sir James's letter with the offer of the job by the desk\nso that he would see it was a genuine stunt. Then I wrote my letter to\nMr. Carter and rang up Sir James. Taking him into my confidence would\nbe the best thing either way, so I told him everything except where I\nbelieved the papers to be hidden. The way he helped me to get on the\ntrack of Tuppence and Annette almost disarmed me, but not quite. I kept\nmy mind open between the two of them. And then I got a bogus note from\nTuppence--and I knew!\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\nTommy took the note in question from his pocket and passed it round the\ntable.\n\n\"It's her handwriting all right, but I knew it wasn't from her because\nof the signature. She'd never spell her name 'Twopence,' but anyone\nwho'd never seen it written might quite easily do so. Julius _had_ seen\nit--he showed me a note of hers to him once--but _Sir James hadn't!_\nAfter that everything was plain sailing. I sent off Albert post-haste to\nMr. Carter. I pretended to go away, but doubled back again. When Julius\ncame bursting up in his car, I felt it wasn't part of Mr. Brown's\nplan--and that there would probably be trouble. Unless Sir James was\nactually caught in the act, so to speak, I knew Mr. Carter would never\nbelieve it of him on my bare word----\"\n\n\"I didn't,\" interposed Mr. Carter ruefully.\n\n\"That's why I sent the girls off to Sir James. I was sure they'd fetch\nup at the house in Soho sooner or later. I threatened Julius with the\nrevolver, because I wanted Tuppence to repeat that to Sir James, so that\nhe wouldn't worry about us. The moment the girls were out of sight I\ntold Julius to drive like hell for London, and as we went along I told\nhim the whole story.", "We got to the Soho house in plenty of time and met\nMr. Carter outside. After arranging things with him we went in and hid\nbehind the curtain in the recess. The policemen had orders to say, if\nthey were asked, that no one had gone into the house. That's all.\"\n\nAnd Tommy came to an abrupt halt.\n\nThere was silence for a moment.\n\n\"By the way,\" said Julius suddenly, \"you're all wrong about that\nphotograph of Jane. It _was_ taken from me, but I found it again.\"\n\n\"Where?\" cried Tuppence.\n\n\"In that little safe on the wall in Mrs. Vandemeyer's bedroom.\"\n\n\"I knew you found something,\" said Tuppence reproachfully. \"To tell you\nthe truth, that's what started me off suspecting you. Why didn't you\nsay?\"\n\n\"I guess I was a mite suspicious too. It had been got away from me once,\nand I determined I wouldn't let on I'd got it until a photographer had\nmade a dozen copies of it!\"\n\n\"We all kept back something or other,\" said Tuppence thoughtfully. \"I\nsuppose secret service work makes you like that!\"\n\nIn the pause that ensued, Mr. Carter took from his pocket a small shabby\nbrown book.\n\n\"Beresford has just said that I would not have believed Sir James Peel\nEdgerton to be guilty unless, so to speak, he was caught in the act.\nThat is so. Indeed, not until I read the entries in this little book\ncould I bring myself fully to credit the amazing truth. This book will\npass into the possession of Scotland Yard, but it will never be publicly\nexhibited. Sir James's long association with the law would make it\nundesirable. But to you, who know the truth, I propose to read certain\npassages which will throw some light on the extraordinary mentality of\nthis great man.\"\n\nHe opened the book, and turned the thin pages.\n\n\"... It is madness to keep this book. I know that. It is documentary\nevidence against me. But I have never shrunk from taking risks. And I\nfeel an urgent need for self-expression.... The book will only be taken\nfrom my dead body....\n\n\"... From an early age I realized that I had exceptional abilities.", "Only\na fool underestimates his capabilities. My brain power was greatly above\nthe average. I know that I was born to succeed. My appearance was\nthe only thing against me. I was quiet and insignificant--utterly\nnondescript....\n\n\"... When I was a boy I heard a famous murder trial. I was deeply\nimpressed by the power and eloquence of the counsel for the defence.\nFor the first time I entertained the idea of taking my talents to that\nparticular market.... Then I studied the criminal in the dock.... The\nman was a fool--he had been incredibly, unbelievably stupid. Even\nthe eloquence of his counsel was hardly likely to save him. I felt\nan immeasurable contempt for him.... Then it occurred to me that the\ncriminal standard was a low one. It was the wastrels, the failures, the\ngeneral riff-raff of civilization who drifted into crime....\nStrange that men of brains had never realized its extraordinary\nopportunities.... I played with the idea.... What a magnificent\nfield--what unlimited possibilities! It made my brain reel....\n\n\"... I read standard works on crime and criminals. They all confirmed my\nopinion. Degeneracy, disease--never the deliberate embracing of a career\nby a far-seeing man. Then I considered. Supposing my utmost ambitions\nwere realized--that I was called to the bar, and rose to the height of\nmy profession? That I entered politics--say, even, that I became Prime\nMinister of England? What then? Was that power? Hampered at every turn\nby my colleagues, fettered by the democratic system of which I should\nbe the mere figurehead! No--the power I dreamed of was absolute! An\nautocrat! A dictator! And such power could only be obtained by working\noutside the law. To play on the weaknesses of human nature, then on the\nweaknesses of nations--to get together and control a vast organization,\nand finally to overthrow the existing order, and rule! The thought\nintoxicated me....\n\n\"... I saw that I must lead two lives. A man like myself is bound to\nattract notice. I must have a successful career which would mask my true\nactivities.... Also I must cultivate a personality.", "I modelled myself\nupon famous K.C.'s. I reproduced their mannerisms, their magnetism. If I\nhad chosen to be an actor, I should have been the greatest actor living!\nNo disguises--no grease paint--no false beards! Personality! I put it\non like a glove! When I shed it, I was myself, quiet, unobtrusive, a man\nlike every other man. I called myself Mr. Brown. There are hundreds of\nmen called Brown--there are hundreds of men looking just like me....\n\n\"... I succeeded in my false career. I was bound to succeed. I shall\nsucceed in the other. A man like me cannot fail....\n\n\"... I have been reading a life of Napoleon. He and I have much in\ncommon....\n\n\"... I make a practice of defending criminals. A man should look after\nhis own people....\n\n\"... Once or twice I have felt afraid. The first time was in Italy.\nThere was a dinner given. Professor D----, the great alienist, was\npresent. The talk fell on insanity. He said, 'A great many men are\nmad, and no one knows it. They do not know it themselves.' I do not\nunderstand why he looked at me when he said that. His glance was\nstrange.... I did not like it....\n\n\"... The war has disturbed me.... I thought it would further my plans.\nThe Germans are so efficient. Their spy system, too, was excellent.\nThe streets are full of these boys in khaki. All empty-headed young\nfools.... Yet I do not know.... They won the war.... It disturbs me....\n\n\"... My plans are going well.... A girl butted in--I do not think she\nreally knew anything.... But we must give up the Esthonia.... No risks\nnow....\n\n\".... All goes well. The loss of memory is vexing. It cannot be a fake.\nNo girl could deceive ME!...\n\n\"...The 29th.... That is very soon....\" Mr. Carter paused.\n\n\"I will not read the details of the _coup_ that was planned. But there\nare just two small entries that refer to the three of you. In the light\nof what happened they are interesting.\n\n\"... By inducing the girl to come to me of her own accord, I have\nsucceeded in disarming her.", "But she has intuitive flashes that might be\ndangerous.... She must be got out of the way.... I can do nothing with\nthe American. He suspects and dislikes me. But he cannot know. I fancy\nmy armour is impregnable.... Sometimes I fear I have underestimated\nthe other boy. He is not clever, but it is hard to blind his eyes to\nfacts....\"\n\nMr. Carter shut the book.\n\n\"A great man,\" he said. \"Genius, or insanity, who can say?\"\n\nThere was silence.\n\nThen Mr. Carter rose to his feet.\n\n\"I will give you a toast. The Joint Venture which has so amply justified\nitself by success!\"\n\nIt was drunk with acclamation.\n\n\"There's something more we want to hear,\" continued Mr. Carter. He\nlooked at the American Ambassador. \"I speak for you also, I know. We'll\nask Miss Jane Finn to tell us the story that only Miss Tuppence has\nheard so far--but before we do so we'll drink her health. The health of\none of the bravest of America's daughters, to whom is due the thanks and\ngratitude of two great countries!\"\n\n\"THAT was a mighty good toast, Jane,\" said Mr. Hersheimmer, as he and\nhis cousin were being driven back in the Rolls-Royce to the _Ritz_.\n\n\"The one to the joint venture?\"\n\n\"No--the one to you. There isn't another girl in the world who could\nhave carried it through as you did. You were just wonderful!\"\n\nJane shook her head.\n\n\"I don't feel wonderful. At heart I'm just tired and lonesome--and\nlonging for my own country.\"\n\n\"That brings me to something I wanted to say. I heard the Ambassador\ntelling you his wife hoped you would come to them at the Embassy right\naway. That's good enough, but I've got another plan. Jane--I want you to\nmarry me! Don't get scared and say no at once. You can't love me right\naway, of course, that's impossible. But I've loved you from the very\nmoment I set eyes on your photo--and now I've seen you I'm simply crazy\nabout you! If you'll only marry me, I won't worry you any--you shall\ntake your own time.", "Maybe you'll never come to love me, and if that's\nthe case I'll manage to set you free. But I want the right to look after\nyou, and take care of you.\"\n\n\"That's what I want,\" said the girl wistfully. \"Some one who'll be good\nto me. Oh, you don't know how lonesome I feel!\"\n\n\"Sure thing I do. Then I guess that's all fixed up, and I'll see the\narchbishop about a special license to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Oh, Julius!\"\n\n\"Well, I don't want to hustle you any, Jane, but there's no sense in\nwaiting about. Don't be scared--I shan't expect you to love me all at\nonce.\"\n\nBut a small hand was slipped into his.\n\n\"I love you now, Julius,\" said Jane Finn. \"I loved you that first moment\nin the car when the bullet grazed your cheek....\"\n\nFive minutes later Jane murmured softly:\n\n\"I don't know London very well, Julius, but is it such a very long way\nfrom the _Savoy_ to the _Ritz?_\"\n\n\"It depends how you go,\" explained Julius unblushingly. \"We're going by\nway of Regent's Park!\"\n\n\"Oh, Julius--what will the chauffeur think?\"\n\n\"At the wages I pay him, he knows better than to do any independent\nthinking. Why, Jane, the only reason I had the supper at the _Savoy_ was\nso that I could drive you home. I didn't see how I was ever going to\nget hold of you alone. You and Tuppence have been sticking together\nlike Siamese twins. I guess another day of it would have driven me and\nBeresford stark staring mad!\"\n\n\"Oh. Is he----?\"\n\n\"Of course he is. Head over ears.\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" said Jane thoughtfully.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"From all the things Tuppence didn't say!\"\n\n\"There you have me beat,\" said Mr. Hersheimmer. But Jane only laughed.\n\nIn the meantime, the Young Adventurers were sitting bolt upright,\nvery stiff and ill at ease, in a taxi which, with a singular lack of\noriginality, was also returning to the _Ritz_ via Regent's Park.\n\nA terrible constraint seemed to have settled down between them. Without\nquite knowing what had happened, everything seemed changed.", "They were\ntongue-tied--paralysed. All the old _camaraderie_ was gone.\n\nTuppence could think of nothing to say.\n\nTommy was equally afflicted.\n\nThey sat very straight and forbore to look at each other.\n\nAt last Tuppence made a desperate effort.\n\n\"Rather fun, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Rather.\"\n\nAnother silence.\n\n\"I like Julius,\" essayed Tuppence again.\n\nTommy was suddenly galvanized into life.\n\n\"You're not going to marry him, do you hear?\" he said dictatorially. \"I\nforbid it.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence meekly.\n\n\"Absolutely, you understand.\"\n\n\"He doesn't want to marry me--he really only asked me out of kindness.\"\n\n\"That's not very likely,\" scoffed Tommy.\n\n\"It's quite true. He's head over ears in love with Jane. I expect he's\nproposing to her now.\"\n\n\"She'll do for him very nicely,\" said Tommy condescendingly.\n\n\"Don't you think she's the most lovely creature you've ever seen?\"\n\n\"Oh, I dare say.\"\n\n\"But I suppose you prefer sterling worth,\" said Tuppence demurely.\n\n\"I--oh, dash it all, Tuppence, you know!\"\n\n\"I like your uncle, Tommy,\" said Tuppence, hastily creating a diversion.\n\"By the way, what are you going to do, accept Mr. Carter's offer of\na Government job, or accept Julius's invitation and take a richly\nremunerated post in America on his ranch?\"\n\n\"I shall stick to the old ship, I think, though it's awfully good of\nHersheimmer. But I feel you'd be more at home in London.\"\n\n\"I don't see where I come in.\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Tommy positively.\n\nTuppence stole a glance at him sideways.\n\n\"There's the money, too,\" she observed thoughtfully.\n\n\"What money?\"\n\n\"We're going to get a cheque each. Mr. Carter told me so.\"\n\n\"Did you ask how much?\" inquired Tommy sarcastically.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Tuppence triumphantly. \"But I shan't tell you.\"\n\n\"Tuppence, you are the limit!\"\n\n\"It has been fun, hasn't it, Tommy? I do hope we shall have lots more\nadventures.\"\n\n\"You're insatiable, Tuppence. I've had quite enough adventures for the\npresent.\"\n\n\"Well, shopping is almost as good,\" said Tuppence dreamily. \"Think of\nbuying old furniture, and bright carpets, and futurist silk curtains,\nand a polished dining-table, and a divan with lots of cushions.\""]
